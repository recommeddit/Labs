658,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"How would you rank expressvpn, mullvad, and cyberghost? I want it mainly to torrent, stream, and surf. I was on nordvpn before but I was not that impressed."
32820,best free online grammar checker,"The free Grammarly takes care of the spellchecking and grammar stuff. Although in my experience, it either misses some things or marks some perfectly fine things (in context) as mistakes. You've got to double-check everything yourself either way.  The premium subscription \*mostly\* deals with issues regarding form, flow, etc. of the text. Like if your sentences are too long or something like that. If you only want to spellcheck, take care of typos/ blatant grammatical mistakes, I don't think you need a premium account, since you'll have to double-check everything either way.

But, what I suggest is that if you \*really\* want a thorough look at your work and you're willing to spend money on it, try and see if you can find a human editor/proofreader who'll do it for you and see what that'll cost you. A good, experienced professional will be much better than  Grammarly, and you'll have given your money to a person instead of a company.

That is, if it turns out to be cost-effective for you (I don't know how much premium costs, I'm on a plan through my job.)

ETA:  The premium version suffers from the same problems that the free version does. It misses stuff and overcorrects some other stuff."
49415,best gaming monitor,"I would really suggest the Dell S2721DGF, its been on sale around 380 for a few weeks now and its practically the best IPS 1440 high refresh rate monitor you can buy atm. 
the other competitor would be the Samsung G7 which a VA panel but still has amazing colors and better contrast, but has that crazy curve, which i personally dont like as i like watching a lot of shows and movies. but the G7 is also a good alternative and of course more expensive as well. 

i bought the Dell a week ago and its amazing, rly good colors and response times, the low contrast on reviews looks bad when they take photos but in real life, its really not a big deal if you are used to IPS panels. and the backlight bleed is also not bad as well."
53596,best medicine for a cold,I actually take a double-dose of the kids' stuff because I hate pills.
42395,movies like Inception,Total Recall. I prefer the version with Ahnold.
65556,best phone service company,"Calling ""long distance"" from your home phone used to cost an arm and a leg"
26928,best board games,"Maybe Quacks, but it depends on what the 7yr old is enjoying right now. What are the kids favorite game mechanics, what does the kid like to play?  
Anything the Kid is a fan of? Maybe a comic series or a TV Series?  


Game I can recommend is Honga from Haba. Honga is a good introduction into woker placing mechanism and tile placement mechanism. It isn't complex and has a colorful artwork.  
Second game is King of the Dice from Haba. Awesome introduction into dice rolling, set collection and push your luck mechanism. Have I mentioned, that King of the Dice can help your children learning math.  


When the kid is more experienced with boardgames you can try out Azul and Quacks."
37979,best Marvel movie,"It’s at least in the top 3 of MCU movies, and number one of the more serious ones. I laughed more during Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy was fun, but Winter Soldier is something special."
6372,best Netflix documentary,"Oh yeah, forgot about Free Solo, it’s one of my favorite documentaries from the last 10 years."
71102,best movies with a cool twist,I just lost the game.
34295,best NFL player,"> Manning was as good or better than most of the QBs we have discussed in this thread and he had to be carried to his 2nd just to join the multiple SB club.

Also because of Brady. Who knows how many he would have won without that constant competition?"
60633,Best comedy show on Netflix,And on Hulu
34850,best NFL player,"I agree. I think the NFL is letting the dust settle a bit, and some time in August they'll say they've conducted their own ""internal investigation"" and decided to suspend him for 17 games. Once the legal matters are settled, I think he'll be back in the league in 2022 (assuming he's not in prison)"
34481,best NFL player,"Lawrence Taylor and Barry Sanders.

I'm torn between the two."
12922,best gifts for mom,"I am not a mother, but I have been dating a father for the past 4 years. We are getting married in September. We have gone through a lot with the ex-wife, who is mentally ill, and we even had emergency custody of his daughter at one point and she lived with us for several months, and during that time I dropped her off and picked her up from school, taught her to read, write, and do math, did homework with her, etc. Now that she is back with her mother, I cook with her and teach her how to cook when she is visiting, I read to her and take care of her and have fought for her and cried when we lost custody of her and I love her, and she loves me.

The point is, one year I would really appreciate it if my fucking fiance would get me a God damn mother's day card, because I think I deserve it. I'm not trying to say I'm playing Mom or trying to take that title or whatever, but just a little recognition on Mother's Day would be nice. But he ever says a peep."
72596,best keyboard switches,I can tolerate Blues but they always feel a little light to me. I've been wanting to get my hands on a board with MX Greens but they are hard to find.
4244,best text editor,"That ""Haha! You use Vim, hoho! Really? You are oooold, LOL!"" -> ""Pshh, you must have a dozen of plugins to do that, right? Right?"" -> ""No, that's not a Practical Vim PDF you saw on my desktop."" pattern is pretty common indeed :-)."
33966,best Pokemon game,"Ah damn, the one game I suggest you start with you exclude."
38000,best Marvel movie,"If you want to use a binary scoring system to rate movies then fine but that doesn't justify misinterpreting the RT score as rating of a movie's quality. Using the RT score to determine the ""best"" movies is flat out using the system wrong. If every critic in the world gave an Adam Sandler movie 6/10, it would have a 100% score. But if 99% of critics gave a Jordan Peele movie 10/10, and 1% rated it 4/10, it would rank lower than the Sandler comedy. The RT score is very useful for audiences to determine the chance that they'll enjoy a movie but it is certainly not a valid way to measure quality."
26709,best board games,"This would have been a perfect opportunity for an April Fools Prank. 

How did Monopoly move into position #1?!"
20773,best workout music,You're the best by Joe Esposito
26707,best board games,"1. Codenames - great party game, except 2 people need to be mostly silent is the only downside.
2. Splendor - very simple card builder, best with 3 players
3. Zany Penguins - chaotic card game for 3-5 players
4. Lords of Vegas - lots of luck in this one
5. Catan - vanilla is best
6. Suburbia - city building, best with 3 players, most complex game in this list
7. Acquire - stock trading game, it can get really dramatic
8. Glux - very simple rules, harder to master
9. Good Cop Bad Cop - chaotic social deduction related game
10. Kingdomino - easygoing domino game"

51447,best iphone case,"I always end up with a leather case, either Apple's official one or one from Bullstrap. They are thin, look good with every outfit, and have decent drop protection. I'll probably be picking up an Apple silicone case for my 12 until they release a leather one next month."
