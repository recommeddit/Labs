"Meh, lg cx or c1 48 till they come out with something better. For me, oled>all. Bleed and light grey blacks are soooo bad. Just started looking for a new monitor last year and can't believe this sector isn't industry leading vs tvs. It's not even a competition."
"You're naturally spread if you're sitting on the toilet.  If you aren't, you've got bigger problems, and your cheeks could use a rinse anyway.  You may be thinking you need to get up, but you don't.  Just stay sitting, turn dial.

You will need to adjust, but it's more a lean forward, sit up thing, if you're not sitting lopsided.  Really isn't a problem even if the cheeks do get residual spray.  Pat dry."
Warmed up tater tots mixed with cooked sausage and pressed through a waffle iron is amazing. Add a fried egg to the top with a little salt and pepper and drizzle a very small amount of syrup across it.
"I love OLED, but the screen on my iPad Pro (10.5 inch, haven't seen any newer ones in person) is the best display I've ever seen. I would buy a ProMotion LCD iPhone over an OLED one"
"I've got 3 in my room right now. It's really good, like a mild Bangster Berry"
"Kursgezagt and Wendover, that the real deal."
"Im not much of an Apple user sadly, sorry I forgot to mention that in my original post"

"I always got happy for houses that had skittles, twix, snickers, and reeses."
"B&BW Gingham is a wonderful scent! I enjoy that one. 

Some of my other favorite “cheapies”, as it were, are:

Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Nectarine Blossom, Jennifer Aniston Beachscapes, and From Wilds Brilliant Bloom (mimosa). The From Wilds is from Target: $18 for 1 oz!"
"Good catch! No one's ever picked up on the Metropolis reference before.I use Bayesian models in three broad cases:

1. When I'm trying to do something beyond prediction. For example, I want to look into causal relationships or I want to evaluate a hypothesis, or I want to get a distribution as my output so I can do an economic analysis and have meaningful intervals.
2. When I want to inject significant domain knowledge into the models --- if I know that certain relationships between variables exist and I have meaningful priors.

I will also use it for inference like you mentioned, as part of EDA, as a way to get a more interpretable model and so on. I also find it can work better in cases where you really do have partial pooling.

But, yeah, for simple predictive models it's basically always XGBoost or linear regression."
"Man, it’s hard to pick just three. Have to go with the personal classics, Dune, Enders Game, Time Enough for Love"
Amazing Marvin will be able to do this with the new calendar feature that is on the roadmap. Should be ready in 4-8 weeks.
Libgen has a lot of college textbooks. I doubt it has *all* books for *any* class.. you’re going to have to do your own legwork on that one.
"haha well, thanks!"
Worst Ant-Man. Best Endgame maybe.
"Oh, it’s not just nostalgia. It’s my honest unbiased opinion. He is objectively the most accurate so far. I’m not in the ridiculous “He’ll never be topped” group but he hasn’t been topped yet. I am very willing to embrace a better, more well-rounded Peter. He just hasn’t come along yet. Shame really. All they have to do is look to The Animated Series and Spectacular to get the character right."
"It is good advice, but I have just found it easier not to travel with my hand grenades."
What's the best pay as you go plan either on AT&T or Verizon? This will be a backup line and won't be used unless required (only need data if that matters)
">Burberry London For Men

This is a fab deal for a great smelling perfume.  Can also find this at Marshalls or Ross."
"The soda really takes the edge off of the alcohol. The berry and gin frink really just tastes like another soda. It makes the acohol invisible, which csn be dangerous becuase some people forget that they are drinking alcohol untill the stand up and notice that the world did a 360."
My favorite was the Children's Crusade.
"It's good. I liked JS&MN a lot more but if those early chapters are what turned you off, *Piranesi* ought to be a lot more approachable. It doesn't explain much but then plot/mystery is fairly telegraphed, though that's not really the book's attraction. It's a slight novel in some regards but a very elegant examination of some interesting ideas (memory, identity, acculturation, Plato's theory of forms) and written in a lovely unique voice."
What mouse do you prefer? XM1r or Superlight and why?
Sorry to Bother You. Mind fucked for days after watching it
