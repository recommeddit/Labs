"> I'll also add that even though I think IW is just ""good"". Black Panther is partly the reason IW didn't score as well with critics. BP was so character focused, so theme heavy, etc. That all the Infinity War shenanigans just seemed less intimate and loud

This is a really good point that I think a lot of MCU fans miss when comparing BP and IW."

"That's a fair enough argument to make. I guess there are two ways to see the NME list-

1. A UK based rock magazine puts out a list of the ""greatest albums of all time"", but manages to include a decent amount of non-rock music from outside of the UK because it truly believes those albums should be recognized.

2. A UK based rock magazine puts out a list of the ""greatest albums of all time"", ignoring countless genres and countries and women in general.

Furthermore, I don't really think this is a problem inherent to ""white male rocker people"" as you do. ""White male rocker people"" are typically the type of people behind professional music journalism. It's not strange that they like other ""white male rocker people."""
