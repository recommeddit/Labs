"This was going to be my number 1 recommendation. It's exactly what you're looking for. It's a lot of fun, full of action and adventure, has some excellent characters and limited POVs."
"great suggestion. such a good series. downvotes be damned, it should be mentioned at least once. It's terrific."
"The MAL list has a lot of sequel bias.  Sequels tend to be overrated (on every website, not only MAL), because anyone who dislikes an anime is unlikely to watch the sequel.  Among the non-sequel series, Cowboy Bebop is #6.

But yes, there are a lot of teenagers on MAL.  It would be interesting if we could see the average rating for each age group."

"Most of the top stars are good. The Khans have a special place in my heart as I grew up watching them, but out of them all, even though lately his movies haven’t been that good; Shahrukh is my all time favourite."
"I find it interesting that Bangladesh and Ireland have an almost identical trend and the gap stays about the same for the last 10 years. On the other hand, New Zealand and Zimbabwe have almost opposite trends throughout the entire period."
"> Thick clients can stand by themselves. They don't need a remote service to function (although they may still talk to remote services for certain extra features).

That is interesting and not something I have heard before. I always assumed thick clients, while doing a lot of the work, were reliant on the remote service for the data to work on. This is food for thought for me thanks."
"I first read their original paper a few months ago, and the professor commented on that sentence specifically. Hilarious understatement."
"It also doesn't pay nearly as well as other development gigs. 

Also do not for the life of you get into game testing. Holy shit.

Edit (in addition to adding the word pay which I forgot):


I don't do game testing but I know a bunch about it from some people I know. Testing of any kind is pretty horrible because you're at the bottom of the tech barrel other than maybe IT. You don't get paid very well (it isn't particularly hard, just very repetitive), you're kind of looked down upon, and the hours aren't great and there is a decent amount of stress. Basically, the perfect person for QA is someone who is smart enough to be competent and motivated to do a good job, but isn't ambitious enough to get out and do something they actually like. I've sat in on hiring for QA, and a lot of candidates we turned down because we just didn't believe we were going to be able to retain them for a long enough time. Anyways, in QA, you're kind of like the company goalkeeper, every time you miss something, you get blamed, but when you do a great job and find all the bugs, you get no recognition.

Game testing is the worst though. You're basically just repeating parts of games all day. Like you have to run into walls, do all sorts of really crappy tasks for hours on end. And that's if you're lucky enough to do real games. I've known a few people who had to QA shit like the Kardashian mobile game. Think of all those horrible mobile games out there. There are people whose jobs it is to test that. 

Anyways, I would really avoid QA as much as possible. You can make a career out of it, but it's kind of a shitty gig that isn't very stimulating that becomes increasingly hard to escape from the longer you're there. You can escape to something like development, but a lot of places don't like letting their QA people move to other groups. And then, if you stay there long enough, unless you've been simultaneously cultivating other skills, the only thing you're going to be qualified and have experience is QA which means at your next job, you get a bit more money and even more stress."
Everclear.
