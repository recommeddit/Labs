67763,axios alternatives reddit,"I think you haven't used Axios, or you haven't dug deep enough into its documentation:

>The automatic JSON transformation hides information. What if I want to get the HTTP headers, cookies, redirect information or read the status code? The response object has valuable information. This should be explicit asked for.

A response returned by axios is a standard HTTP response that has been parsed to a friendly JS object from the JSON string. This reduces the number of repetitive tasks that you have to do (manually parse JSON like in Fetch), thus reducing the probability you might get an error. The less code you have to write, the better.

>The implicit automatic error handling isn't usefull perse. With REST non-200-ok status codes might mean something for your app. This should also be asked for explicitly.

It is a terrible behavior for Fetch to receive a 500 status code from the server and treat it as 200. Server error is something you should always expect as a server maintainer, for example, your server might not implement autoscaling and is prone to DDOS attack. If this happens, the client side of your web application is very likely to experience 500 or 40x status code. It is bad if Fetch considers this a failed 200-ish status code.

>Globally defined interceptors are bad. Globals are bad. Just chain a transform function into your promise chain or create a factory function.

You should never, ever use a global variable to send HTTP requests. It's always a must that you create an instance for each type of HTTP requests you're about to send, like basic requests or authentication-based HTTP requests. In this way, you can isolate different types of HTTP request from one another, giving each with different types of interceptors that doesn't occupy a global variable name. 

>IE8 support is not that valuable, and in most cases these days the app itself doesn't even support IE8 (or IE9, or IE10) so this support wastes bytes for unused features. If this is really important it should be an optional addon/plugin.

It is not just about IE8, but it is more about a wider range of compatibility. And if you develop an app professionally, you should always consider transpiling your Javascript code so it will improve the performance of your app, protect your source code, reduce the app size, as well as supporting a wider range of browser. And of course, it is better if your HTTP client can also do the same thing."

My friends and girls seem to agree that La Nuit just suits me. I asked my brothers opinion of Black Orchid when I got home and he said 'oh yeah nice, it would suit you' 

I wear it for myself because I catch a whif every now and then and I remember how good it smells, but knowing the opposite sex likes it helps."
