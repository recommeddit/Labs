65562,best phone service company,"Here here, Google Fi kicks ass. I worked as a field biologist for a while and it got great service in a bunch of remote areas in the bay area that I never expected (and my ATT work phone didn't). The hassle free international service is amazing, too. Spain, Morocco, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan... Didn't have to do a damn thing for my phone to work in those counties. Landed and got going."

Oh, and the game looks really good for something that's only on 360. Lots of cars and upgrade parts, and Jeremy Clarkson's in it. Can't beat that."

16954,best iOS game,It makes sense but I would say not just saving money but time. The ability to jump right into a game on an iPad is another selling point. Not that XBOX or PlayStation takes hours but it does take longer. This is definitely more pick up and play.
