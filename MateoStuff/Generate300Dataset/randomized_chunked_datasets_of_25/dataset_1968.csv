60295,"I found that it was too difficult to find the items I needed in a large freezer.  It was full for only a short period of time and then space was wasted.  I switched to a smaller one and intended to buy a second small freezer if I ran out of room.  My intention was to fill both freezers and then empty one and unplug it when they got half empty.  I never did run out of room with only one.  You just adjust your buying accordingly.  

If you have a large family and/or you are an organized person and can partitian off a larger freezer to simplify finding items than you may find a large freezer convenient but I found mine to be a pain.",best freezer brand

Another thing that heard Catherine O'Hara explain (on radio interview) was that all of her wigs (bébés) are named after her family and friends!
