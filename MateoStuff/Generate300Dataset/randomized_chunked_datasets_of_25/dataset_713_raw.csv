"I Think You Should Leave and Aunty Donna's House of Fun are both absurdist sketch shows I've rewatched multiple times, lotta fun and easy binging (6 episodes each)"
Knoxville gray is my current favorite dark green and I am painting everything with it!
"In Indonesia, we have luggage wrapper service, basically covering the whole luggage with plastic wraps. Two bucks for one item."
"I mean, how good a twist is it when even the actors themselves were shocked by it in the theater?  Usual Suspects is the only other one I can think of that pulled that sort of thing off."
i cannot disagree with u good choices
I wish I were as organized as you tbh. I just throw whatever in my calendar. üòµ

"Came here for this, the piano is an incredible sounding instrument popular in all genres from rock and pop to classical.

Tom waits converted me to my belief, love that man."

I've been meaning to go back and read that. I remember loving them back in sixth grade but don't remember anything beyond the term tesseract and the vague memory that was some sort of transportation method.
"Grand Teton National Park. There's nothing like majestic mountains rising straight up out of nothing. No foothills, nothing - just flat plains, then bam, mountain peaks.

Plus, we got to watch the eclipse in Jackson on that trip. Just sitting and chilling in a local baseball park with maybe thirty other people. In a place that high and dry, you could clearly feel the temperature drop from the loss of sunlight - it was pretty neat."
"Yeah and I got it for $120 with a controller. It was broken and still had the warranty, I was buying it to see if I could fix it myself and I just had to send it to Microsoft because it still had the warranty."
Now that's a cool tree. Maybe the coolest willow I've seen!
"I met Paul Rudd on a flight from NY, sat next too him on the plane. My buddy leaned over and told me that he wanted to compliment him on this band shirt he wore when making Clueless, but he ""didn't want it to be weird"". So his solution was to write him a note and slip it to him, lol. So he does this, and Paul just gets this nervous look on his face, opens the note and reads it. Starts cracking up laughing, leaned over to us and said ""best note ever"". He then told us the whole story of the shirt, how he fought with the costume dept about it because it was the shirt he wore to set that day. We talked the whole flight, dude was super cool.

Edit: Band is Trip Shakespeare."
"Yep. Any war which is done according to the legal institutions of a nation is, to me, justified, as long as it is in accordance with the predominant views of the body politic.  

EDIT: Also, down votes for my opinion? Really? You don't have to upvote it, but if you disagree, at least tell me why so we may discuss it."
"Barca are insanely high for a team which won there first in 1992, then again they have won a good few recently so its hard to argue. Liverpool being behind Utd baffles me honestly, i cant even make a case for it"
"It's used at 262‚Ç¨ from Amazon warehouse, so I can benefit from amazon return policy in 30 days...

Are the colours very washed out? I know it's a TN. How is black uniformity and contrast?

How does it perform in game?

Thanks"

"Bobby Kennedy is my hero.  He inspired me to go to law school, even though he died a quarter century before I was born."
Is your website related to racing or was it just random?
"I advise against ‚Äúcritter‚Äù type pets... they‚Äôre smelly, extremely messy and can bite. I would say get a reptile (turtle, lizard, etc) or maybe let them get fish. If you do go with a critter- get 2 rats. Rats are fairly clean and they have personality but they still need weekly cage cleanings and attention."
"What, no Cronenberg? 

eXistenz is way, way up there. Jude Law plays a bodyguard to a woman who has designed an Inception-tier virtual reality video game. Waaaay too cool. 

Videodrome is less of a ""whoa it was Earth all along"" kind of mindfuck, but the Ex Machina kind of slow burn as the film's philosophy start falling into place. 

The Fly, obviously, but it's only a mindfuck if the only other movie you've seen with Jeff Goldblum starts with the phrase ""Jurassic Park."""
