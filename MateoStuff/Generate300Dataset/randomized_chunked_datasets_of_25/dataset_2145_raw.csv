"I haven't seen it yet, but it's always been important to me to work for a company that I believe is ethical, and to work on projects that I feel are doing good in the world.

Software engineers are in high demand and they have a lot of leverage. You're not likely to find yourself in a situation where somebody is forcing you to implement an ""evil"" feature or be fired. If you think it's evil, you can push back. If the company isn't a good fit you shouldn't have a hard time finding another job.

Just about every controversial piece of software is quite nuanced and usually the people working on it really do believe in it."
"I used to use nnn but I had some issues (my own fault probably) and went with fff, but they are extremely similar."
That's pretty much the only reason I think they haven't fired Jennifer Rubin or Marc Thiessen. They're pretty much just there to make conservatives look like insane douchebags.

"I mean, ADHD is basically the brain being wired to think a different way. When people with ADHD are given medication to correct the way their brain's are wired, they basically get to put all the energy they used to keep focused into actually thinking."
Let's face it... I'm simply not going to floss twice a day. Should I floss in the morning or at night?
"I myself am no longer a computer science major, wasn't what I wanted out of life, but my roommate still is and, at our university at least, it is required that all computer science majors must also complete a minor in math. So he is looking at taking 7+ math classes."

">Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.

Dude

What

I have the exact opposite problem. I sort of lose track of time and go ""hmmm i don't feel like I brushed this tooth enough"" and I end up brushing my teeth for like 8 minutes"
"I can understand taking out the calcium for the kidney stone sufferers, but the rust (iron oxide) should be left for anemics. Ehh...or sweeping generalizations like this are bad."

It's pretty decent but you know beforehand most people would make a different list.
Also unlike baseball the rules and scoring has changed so much over the last 100 years. Even the size and shape of the football has changed.
