"Look at who the Puppies actually nominated: Neil Stephenson, Alistair Reynolds, Orson Scott Card, Brandon Sanderson, China Mieville.

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with liking these authors, I do myself, and most of those authors were outspoken against the Puppies. But thereâ€™s also no denying that thereâ€™s heavy overlap between this subs recommendations and that list. Like I said in another comment, if you were to write down this subâ€™s top 20 recommended authors and show that list to a Puppy they wouldnâ€™t find much to object to. 

This sub doesnâ€™t branch out much."
The Sixth Sense by that definition was just a revelation then too.

"So, the issue with hand sanitizer is not that it isn't effective at killing bacteria, the problem is that it is very good at killing bacteria indiscriminately.

Bacteria live all over your body, inside and out.  Their behavior ranges from beneficial, to neutral to detrimental.  For most people, the vast majority of bacteria making their home reside on the beneficial side.

The reason for this is that even a bacteria with no direct positive (making food more easy to digest or whatever) but also no direct negative (making you sick) still use resources that prevents a directly negative bacteria from taking it's place.  These neutral bacteria provide us the benefit of competing with negative bacteria.

When you rub alcohol all over your hands you kill all positive, negative and neutral bacteria on your hands, which opens up a massive number of new homes for bacteria all over your hands and some of those bacteria might not be friendly.

So what do?

Don't use antibacterial soap for your hands (dishes, w/e).  Water alone removes a significant number of transient bacteria.  Seriously, it's between 50 and 75%.  Handwashing with soap and water is of course better and will get rid of 70-95% of transient bacteria (depending on study and what bacteria they're looking at).  These methods will leave the resident flora (for the most part) of your hands happy to live and compete with all the negative nancy's that try to enter to community.

The only real reason to wash with alcohol or other disinfectants is when you're practicing aseptic technique, either for maintaining pure cultures or treating people medically."
pretty sure they liked her.
"Hi, does color gamut coverage matter to you?"
">They ""assume liability"" in exactly the same way that Microsoft ""assumes liability"" for Windows; they promise absolutely nothing, but will try to help you fix any problems that arise.

Neither one promise to help you fix any problems.

What they do is offer indemnity usually limited to your purchase price.

If you get sued for patent infringement and lose they will refund the money you paid for their software.

>Suits tend to find this comforting for some strange reason.

Any corporation is like a septic tank. The really big pieces of shit rise to the top."
Did you also just read Robert Harris' Cicero trilogy?

"I canâ€™t speak towards the best but I have tried paperlike and it felt fine. What got me is the price however which leads me to not suggest it.

I went with iCarez and they feel a bit smoother in comparison, they are cheaper even for a 2 pack, and havenâ€™t noticed any nib wear at all and I write a toooon of handwritten notes/drawings.

I donâ€™t think you can really go wrong with any of those brands you listed from what I have read looking for mine a few months ago. iCarez works well."
"hold on whats mine, found it on here somewhere, ""Hardstep"" by Robert Kern on spotify. Also sorry if thats personal info just trying to make it searchable. I bounce aroun on that 165 song playlist on shuffle and find something I can get huge to often."
"Any Oakley backpack. I have an Oakley Icon and it has lasted me since 2004. Only one zipper is malfunctioning which was my fault. I take this thing with me everywhere. Biking, Trips, school and hiking. It made it all of the way to Africa and back and has been beaten to hell. It's going strong and is one of my favorite possessions."
