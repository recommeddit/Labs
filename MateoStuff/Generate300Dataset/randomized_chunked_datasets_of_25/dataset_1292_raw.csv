Western PA here. Also never saw a mars bar in my entire Halloween career
Let's wait for now.
"I try to avoid both honestly.

My local electrical supply house has a way better selection and usually better prices on anything electrical related.  HD and Lowes are both INSANELY HIGH on their price per ft for wire, probably because most people just don't know better.

There's a large local lumberyard about the same distance away as HD, their prices are comparable, sometimes cheaper.  Nicest part is, I can call them up and rattle off a list of materials I need, show up a half hour later and they have it all stacked and wrapped on a pallet ready to load into my truck.  They also have a great project desk that is more than willing to help design & spec out things like decks, fences, awnings or lean-tos, etc. for no extra fee."
"I wont answer as a woman, but as a man, whether or not you are a man or woman, playing the piano well with eloquence and grace is almost a complete turn on for me."
You don’t understand how perfect the top 4 on this list are.
"Shared an elevator with Beyoncé back in the early 2000s when she was doing the Destiny’s Child farewell tour. It was my dad, me, Beyoncé, and a hulking bodyguard. My dad being my dad didn’t know who she was and assumed they were a married couple and gave the man crap about carrying all the bags himself. She laughed, he kinda giggled a bit and they looked at each other awkwardly. Then they hopped off the elevator and walked straight onto a tour bus with her face plastered on the side at which point my dad asked “wait who is that”. 5/7 would share an elevator again."
XL xsoft is in stock
"For sure, I'll pick it up once the complete edition is announced lol 40 is too steep for me rn. Especially with my damn backlog."
"The Commonwealth Saga is either the two you mentioned or the set of about 10 books in the same universe. They're all pretty good, with Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained probably being the best two"
"dude just get a cheap one off amazon they have no latency difference between expensive ones and then a bit later down the line u can upgrade to like a opto mech e.g. steelseries apex pro and huntsman.

(edit) Redragon K552 has 4.5 stars and is only 50 bucks"
"I bought an electric lunchbox on ebay for $30AUD. I love it. You can cook basically anything you could cook in a pot on the stove but its got stacking layers for different things. Very compact.

I usually make rice & curry for my lunch but it's also great for omelettes, boiled eggs, porridge, soups, ive seen people even do cakes & puddings. It's really handy at work, best little gadget ever."
Yeah because everyone in the family sucks and Khloe sucks the least
"I was going for hp envy x360 15inch, sadly they dont have my wanted option anymore.. Which was probably the best for its price."
"Grab a handful throw it into their bucket/pillowcase/whatever.

Turn off your porch light when you run out of candy."
John Barrowman (Captain Jack in Doctor Who and Torchwood and also Malcom Merlin in Arrow) is so cool and gives amazing hugs.
40 hours per week? A remote job or freelancing?
"So it's basically, ""Pay the hooker, motherfucker"""
"that reminds me, I should buy a 4G LTE Tracfone one of these days.  My current CDMA phone is stuck on 1XRTT."
"Age of Ultron and Infinity War are way too low. Honestly I think Black panther is a bit too high. Beyond that, not a bad list overall I guess. I'd rank things differently of course, but not too bad."
"Ryzen likes 3000+mhz ram. And since 2400mhz ram is barely any cheaper than 3200mhz ram you can gain quite a bit of performance for really low amount of extra cost.

TL;DR going from 2400mhz to 3200mhz is a really good price/performance investment. (your ryzen would still work with 2400mhz ram)."
That one seriously messes with your head hahahaha
I'm not entirely sure what I expected.
I’ve been looking for a good razor. Can’t seem to find this on Amazon. Would you mind posting the link?
I listened to one of the Joe Rogan podcasts with Dr Rhonda Patrick a while ago and honestly it was so so interesting! A lot of the stuff she covers is stuffed I believed I wouldn't be interested in but man she really changed my mind
"I believe all US Mobile esim data only plans expire after one month. Or can you point where you saw it lasts till used? At the very least they charge $2 esim fee every month.

Only Dent has long term annual esim data."
