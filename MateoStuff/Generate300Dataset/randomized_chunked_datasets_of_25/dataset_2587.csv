46342,best trick or treating candy,"let the kids pick the candy so they can get something they actually like. tell them to take 2 or 3 pieces. leave your lights on and put up decorations if you have them so people know you are participating. keep your door closed until they knock because its awkward walking up to a house with someone staring you down until you reach the door. once they knock, you open the door, and they say trick or treat, tell them how awesome their costumes are then tell them to take some candy and wish them a good night. the time depends on your neighborhood and how long you want to do it. if you run out of candy or dont want to give out any more, turn off your porch light and any lights visible from that entrance of your house. have fun!"
72523,best keyboard switches,"I'm aware. The membrane buckling springs have a ~70 gram actuation force and are my preferred key-switch due to the immediate tactile and auditory feedback compared to the slightly delayed feedback of MX switches. Also the lovely metallic hum that they tend to create when you're typing away.

Edit: corrected find to fine"
