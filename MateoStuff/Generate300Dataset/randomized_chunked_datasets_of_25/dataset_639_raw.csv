"It's the first one I read. The only other one I read was *The Dispossessed*. They were only loosely connected, and all sources say as much for the whole series. Same universe, different planet, basically."
"I found this in the gutter when I was younger and ""rescued"" it to my bookshelf.  It's a bit smudged in places, but was still one of my better finds."
"So to simplify all this, when I first get a cold, just a runny nose with no colored phelgm, take zyrtec to stop the production of mucus.

If it reaches sinus infection, take advil cold and sinus? I was desperate and right now I have a mild cold and took advil cold and sinus along with an anti histamine (claritin, not working) and nasal spray. Is that bad? My phelgm still clear."
That original post gave me serious anxiety.

"+1 on Ron Wyden. That guy basically singlehandedly held PIPA (Senate version of SOPA) and CISPA from being passed until public outrage and sentiment against got them scuttled.

"Pros:

Very interesting and diverse classes. I took everything from history of economic thought to economics of terrorism. Along with the more analytical classes of course.

You have a wide array of careers to go into afterwards.

A lot of what you learn is applicable to real life.

Cons:

You better be good at math AND english. Its both writing and math intensive. You can't just be a creative or analytical type of person. You must be well rounded. 

Good luck. I have done everything from finance, to accounting, to owning my own business with my degree."

"I suspect that most sub\-$25 sunglasses will hurt your eyes in some way or another... And also, yeah, break, because yeah, they're that cheap. I've had a pair of ray bans for five years now, and as irresponsible as I am, they've been going strong."
"Hi, for school work, the Ryzen 5 4500U is plenty powerful. The Flex 5 14"" is typically $600 when Amazon themselves are selling it, but it has been mainly third parties for the time being. I think that more RAM is more important than a very strong CPU for general use. What is your budget?"
"Best: *Avengers Endgame*

Worst: *Thor: The Dark World*

It doesn't really get better than *Endgame*. That was peak MCU.

*Thor: The Dark World* plain sucked. Like, does anybody remember anything from that movie?"
"Anupam Kher is brilliant.

Also Dilip Kumar."
