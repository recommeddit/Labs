67753,"Beh, bad article. Doesn't really go into details why thing are ""better"" or ""more secure"". It might be good, but the way this is written seems like 'my-favorite-tool' fandom.

1. The automatic JSON transformation hides information. What if I want to get the HTTP headers, cookies, redirect information or read the status code? The response object has valuable information. This should be explicit asked for.

2. What is the XSRF protection? How does it work ""being better""? Doesn't this need support on the server side?

3. The implicit automatic error handling isn't usefull perse. With REST non-200-ok status codes might mean something for your app. This should also be asked for explicitly.

4. Globally defined interceptors are bad. Globals are bad. Just chain a transform function into your promise chain or create a factory function.

5. Progress info is pretty cool actually.

6. IE8 support is not that valuable, and in most cases these days the app itself doesn't even support IE8 (or IE9, or IE10) so this support wastes bytes for unused features. If this is really important it should be an optional addon/plugin.

And the slammer:

22479,Back in 2004 my mom took me on a trip to LA to do some shopping for my 13th birthday. We went to Rodeo Drive just to look around at all the fancy stores and when we popped into Louis Vuitton I saw Nicky Hilton along with her body guard. Now being a teenage girl in the early 2000’s I absolutely loved the Hilton sisters and Nicole Richie. I went up to her and asked if I could get a picture with her and she said yes! My mom got out the camera to take a picture when the sales staff came running over telling us we couldn’t take pictures inside the store. I was pretty bummed. Nicky then asked me if I’d like to go outside and take a picture with her. I was so excited she dropped everything just to go outside and take a picture with me! We take the picture and talk with her for a few minutes before going our separate ways. She was so kind and very soft spoken. Nothing like you’d read about her and Paris in the tabloids. It made my birthday for sure!,best celebrity
