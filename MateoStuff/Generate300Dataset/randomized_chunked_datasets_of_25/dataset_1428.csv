56652,"Fair enough, although arguably the same could be said about G-Sync and FreeSync - while they are more pervasive technologies than 3DV ever was, they are still niche compared to the “big three” of resolution, frequency and screen size. It’s a bullet point that crops up on a spec list - about the only niche/spec point that doesn’t really need explaining in the same way is ultrawide monitors, because you can see what that is in the image of the monitor itself. All the others, up to and including the tech of the display panel itself, are generally less important than the big three to “someone just looking for a monitor to play some games on”. Maybe the other spec that is important is response time, but generally most people would take a look at the frequency of the monitor and just say bigger = better.",best desktop monitor

So I reloaded a save from before I killed that character expecting it to go roughly the same, but literally everything went completely different the second time, dialogs were different, it was great.",Best RPG game on PS4
61774,"That just depends on what kind of rpgs you grew up on. Some people great up with Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, others grew up on Baulders Gate and D&D.

It's usually clear what a genre is by how you progress. If a game is mostly world exploration puzzles to progress, then it's adventure. If it's just puzzles to progress, then it's a puzzle. If it's mostly shooting to progress, than its a shooter. If it's mostly jumping around to progress, then it's a platformer. If it's mostly killing things in real time to progress, then it was action. If it was tactically micro managing troops progress, then it was strategy. If it was successfuly simulating people or events, then it was a simple. If it's moving one side to the other side, it was side scroller. 

Rpgs were mostly story based or level based to progress, but in todays world that's barely a genre.",Best RPG game on PS4
