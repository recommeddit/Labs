And also there are more affordable options for mics on the desk/on a stand. Here in Europe, Superlux is a good brand for that stuff. They make copies of brand-name products that are still good quality, just at about half of the price.",best webcamera

58752,"This is pretty good advice. There are two schools of thought when it comes to cologne and scents. 

1. A signature scent: A person will wear this scent for their entire life, it becomes a part of them. I won't go into this because you covered it let much on the nose.

2. Scent as an accessory: this might be more of a younger generation invention in the US, but it's a common school of thought in other countries. Some scents are designed to be used for certain occasions, lighter citrus for the day/summer and heavier spicy scents for night/winter. 

I personally like a hybrid of the two. I have 2 scents that I alternate fit the day and about 3-4 that I alternate when I'm going out or dressing up for something fancy. It all depends on how I'm feeling or the feelings that I want to evoke. If it's a cold winter day I'll choose a warmer heavier scent. If I'm in a meeting I'll choose something that is crisp, strong, lightly citrus but not overbearing. Date night will call for something a bit more perfumy, something that will linger a bit where you get light pleasant wisps of scent when you come closer.

There is no right or wrong it's preference. Just don't spray half the bottle on your self so people can smell you a mile away.

30841,"I'm a bit biased on this, but pick the north, on the coast. It can be really beautiful. But one problem, which I totally forgot, there is still inner-German discrimination. People living in the east (the former GDR) are making only 60-80% of the money they would with the same job in the west, 25 years after the country reunited. We are still seen as second-class people by some",best country to live in

So in theory having no padlock will probably do a better job of discouraging petty theft than having one as it makes it seem like you don’t carry any valuables. 

Also if your bag comes to you sliced open (someone used a knife) then you have evidence of tampering by airport workers. However if someone opens the zipper like I described, there is no evidence.",best suitcase lock
