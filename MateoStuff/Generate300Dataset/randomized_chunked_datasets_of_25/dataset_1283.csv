51559,best iphone case,"Can confirm this case SLAPS! I’ve had one on my last three phones and ordered one for my 11 Pro. I beat on my phones and use them as a tool. Regularly getting covered in motor oil and geese, paint, dropped from ladders. The case always cleans right up. Insane value for a $15 case."
3412,best webcamera,"This is entirely true. I also would like to claim that you don't need to throw hundreds on an expensive mic. Heck, the mod mics today are even good enough. And also there are more affordable options for mics on the desk/on a stand. Here in Europe, Superlux is a good brand for that stuff. They make copies of brand-name products that are still good quality, just at about half of the price."

58752,best cologne,"This is pretty good advice. There are two schools of thought when it comes to cologne and scents. 

1. A signature scent: A person will wear this scent for their entire life, it becomes a part of them. I won't go into this because you covered it let much on the nose.

2. Scent as an accessory: this might be more of a younger generation invention in the US, but it's a common school of thought in other countries. Some scents are designed to be used for certain occasions, lighter citrus for the day/summer and heavier spicy scents for night/winter. 

I personally like a hybrid of the two. I have 2 scents that I alternate fit the day and about 3-4 that I alternate when I'm going out or dressing up for something fancy. It all depends on how I'm feeling or the feelings that I want to evoke. If it's a cold winter day I'll choose a warmer heavier scent. If I'm in a meeting I'll choose something that is crisp, strong, lightly citrus but not overbearing. Date night will call for something a bit more perfumy, something that will linger a bit where you get light pleasant wisps of scent when you come closer.

There is no right or wrong it's preference. Just don't spray half the bottle on your self so people can smell you a mile away.

Source: sold perfumes and cologne for about 7 years, just some of my observations from experience"
30841,best country to live in,"I'm a bit biased on this, but pick the north, on the coast. It can be really beautiful. But one problem, which I totally forgot, there is still inner-German discrimination. People living in the east (the former GDR) are making only 60-80% of the money they would with the same job in the west, 25 years after the country reunited. We are still seen as second-class people by some"

51549,best iphone case,"Yeah they still begin to peel and flake, but in my experience longer than a few months, maybe half a year or a bit less? Had one for just under a year now and it’s still mostly intact though."

68936,best science fiction novel,"I know it missed the year by a bit, but I wish Hyperion were on this list."
10582,best suitcase lock,"The thing if you have a pen, then to you a bag with a padlock is just as easy to open as a bag without. (In most cases) 

So in theory having no padlock will probably do a better job of discouraging petty theft than having one as it makes it seem like you don’t carry any valuables. 

Also if your bag comes to you sliced open (someone used a knife) then you have evidence of tampering by airport workers. However if someone opens the zipper like I described, there is no evidence."
24003,best anime,"* Gintama - Nothing has made me laugh so hard ever + badass action
* Black Lagoon - A unique story told very well
* Initial D - gets you really really excited even if you don't care about cars
* Hunter x Hunter - I think you all know
* Hyouka - Just general enjoyment and a likeable group of characters
* Psycho Pass - A scary real interpretation of the human mind and the possibilities of corruption"
