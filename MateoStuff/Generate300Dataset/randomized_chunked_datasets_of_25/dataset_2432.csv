14828,"The Memory House by Jenetta James. I narrate the audiobook version (Audible), and didn't expect to enjoy it as a reader; was blown away by the quality of the writing and deftness with which the author switches between and interweaves these two love stories that both concern the same house in London. Will probably appeal most to British readers, or readers with 'British tastes'; the heroine of the modern day story is very English, and the whole feel is sweet, a bit wryly funny, and understated but all the more moving for that. In this case I don't benefit from sales (I was paid a lump sum to narrate the book upfront), this is a genuine recommendation, I don't personally know the author.",best romantic novel

18054,"Kim and kris (well les be honest, the entire fam is controversial) but I loveee kim and kris so much because they’re the ultimate shot callers meaning they both know that fame, money & power is pretty much all a game & they know how to play annd win that game. Of course they’ve always been pretty privileged and well off but like how we say some people can turn a “nickel into a dollar,” kim and kris know how to turn a million turn into a hundred million haha",best Kardashian
44647,"I'm just saying, I live in middle of nowhere farm land Alberta and I don't know a single person who owns a Canada Goose jacket yet they're all outside working hard no matter the weather. You can get some awesome jackets that are warm AF without dropping $1,000 on the status symbol of Canada Goose. That being said, cheap is cheap. I own one nice branded jacket for city errands and the rest of my stuff is more ""farmer Gucci"", so I look homeless but I don't die when I'm outside in - 40.",best items under $100
61988,"I found them both great fun, but I enjoyed 2 more because of the extra way weapons were handled and armor.  You got to get loot with stats/buffs that changed your appearance and were meaningful with stats.

I liked being able to switch between weapon styles to change my play style.

I preferred 2 but both games are great fun.",Best RPG game on PS4

12897,"Actually this came up in our talk too. It seems she doesn't have the strength to ask my brother to get his shit together and when she finds it, my dad won't back her up. He's miserable too, but they both feel bad because they think that they did something wrong while raising him. I'm much less sympathetic and I kind of think my brother is taking advantage. I mentioned that I could have a frank talk with him telling him to get his shit together and she didn't say no. She actually seemed kind of excited, but I could tell she felt guilty about that. My mother's said that she doesn't mind cleaning up after my dad when she has to. She knew she was a slob when she married him, plus he does help out a lot, he's just not as meticulous as she'd like. With my brother, he's truly like a child. She has to beg him to clean up after himself or for help paying a bill.",best gifts for mom
