42089,movies like Inception,Someone just compared a movie with a 2.7 IMDB rating to Christopher Nolan's biggest science fiction epics... and that actually makes me really curious.
56883,best water brand,Acqua panna. It’s the flat water Pellegrino puts out.
20082,best workout music,"This list is cliche and retarded. I mean come on, noone actually listens to the Rocky montage song when they exercise."
26884,best board games,"That’s really the primary reason my group and I imagine many other groups play it too, for the skirmish/combat and combat system. Even the publisher website starts off with “EURO-INSPIRED TACTICAL COMBAT IN AN EVOLVING CAMPAIGN”."
7212,best iPhone,"Looks like an Ex Ess, sounds like an Ex Ess. It’s an Ex Ess"
46786,best hand santizer brand,"> for the record, this sort of reference counting is not usually considered valid, just so you know.

Really?  I would never have guessed.  Especially considering that ""pwned"" is a word with such a rich past in the history of science, going back to the time when Euclid beat Aristotle at chess."
68658,best science fiction novel,"If you’re looking for space or alien based movies then 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien series, Contact, Arrival, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind"
59437,best perfume,"Floriental is more flowery but simultaneously, not flowery at all. Idk why it’s called Floriental but that is CDG’s philosophy I see. 


I’ll try out both & unisex/Colognes are the fragrances I absolutely love!!"
1428,best ice cream flavor,"Either Superman or blue moon. And I don’t mean that dyed vanilla Superman, I mean the Midwest Superman that has blue moon as the blue flavor. (Also not blue moon as in the beer)"
8376,best toothpaste,"Do you get tonsil stones? They can cause chronic bad breath!

I had my tonsils removed once they started appearing, because of this fun fact."
44954,best items under $100,"A heated mattress pad is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I think it was a little more than a hundo so didn't fit here, but a warm bed is the best thing ever."
64816,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Shanghai for Chinese food.  
La Tapatia for Mexican food.  
The Habit for burgers.  
Blenders for smoothie."
31737,best hotel to live in,They are extremely warm and polite.  I've even hung out with them on occasion (which is against the rules).  They are just 20-22 year olds with bright dreams and much experience ahead of them.  They all want to do bigger and better things.  I like hearing people's stories.
58446,best cologne,Ouch man.   Ouch.
20702,best workout music,Man of Steel theme by Hans Zimmer. Just try it and you’ll know.
58204,best cologne,And now Light Blue sales just rose 500%.
57322,best water brand,"R34 man. If it exists there's porn of it, and Rule 35, if there is none, it will be made. Nothing is safe, unfortunately."
4210,best text editor,Second for NotePad++ but also Textpad. I prefer Textpad myself but depends on what you're using it for.
54491,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Interesting. I was planning to get xsoft until i read your comment. Whats your sensitivity in cm/360?
32165,best hotel to live in,"About 7 or 8 years ago, I was dating a guy who had formerly been the general manager at an upscale boutique hotel in Rome that was converted from a gorgeous neoclassical bank. We traveled to Rome on holiday and stayed in the hotel where my boyfriend was ""Papà!"", he had hired literally everyone who worked at the hotel, we were treated like family. It was amazing."
55746,best action and adventure novel series,"Wow, I totally forgot about this series. It's definitely a hidden gem."
73735,best matte screen protector for ipad,I recently got a set of matte screen protectors by iCarez for my 11 inch iPad Pro. I think it had some of the best reviews I saw on Amazon. The application process was pretty intuitive. There was a video you could follow online if you needed it. The quality seems good. It keeps the fingerprints away and writing on it feels good. There is some degradation in the screen quality but it does not seem too bad. I plan to keep it for now.
31187,best country to live in,"What else Americans don't tell you is that great health insurance they get from work still has deductibles and caps. God forbid you get MS or require dialysis for the rest of your life, you'll get cut off at a certain point for treatment. No amount of extra money is worth that risk."
73658,best battery bank,This happened to my Anker on the AT also.
29655,best game console,Ah yes I forgot about this issue. Does anyone know if the games on the list currently falll under this issue?
