"Wait, how the hell did GW manage to be so high? We’re like 60ish in USNews and WSJ, are we that much higher up in Forbes?"

"I have a [Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html) (which is around $200) and the quality is pretty good. Plus, Windows Hello is super convenient.

Also, Dell just released the [UltraSharp webcam](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-webcam/apd/319-bbhp/pc-accessories) (also at $200) which is pretty good according to reviews."
"One important aspect I don't see mentioned here is arm length (also called temple length).  After years of trouble finding sunglasses that fit me well, I found out that I have a 'long' head, from front to back.  This means most standard sunglasses tend to pinch just behind my ears and the arms flex outward, rather than hugging the sides of my head.  This has nothing to do with frame size, but it looks pretty dreadful.  

One way to fix this is to ask an optometrist to straighten the arms, which are usually curved inward.  Though most cheap sunglasses cannot be reshaped."
[Watch It Played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Wfdn5Es8U) has a really good tutorial and sample gameplay videos for 7 Wonders. It helped me learn/teach the game.
"Construction worker here and can confirm, your feet are your most valuable tool. Treat them well and buy good boots, shoes and socks."
"Arguable on classical saxophone. The meta on what sounds good is so in dispute with how to handle the conical bore that there are relatively few players who have an indisputably good tone. There are plenty of good players below that level for sure, it’s just not as uniform as the tone would be for something like more established instruments like piano or even clarinet (cylindrical bore).

Tl;dr easy entry into a plateau leagues below a high ceiling with an exorbitantly steep slope"

"Father, Soldier Son is along the same lines kind of.  It is not lighthearted"
"If the meal experience isn't important to you and you just want balanced, quick, cheap calories I suggest soylent powder. I don't use it everyday but when I'm super busy it is a life saver."
"I love this one so much, and to my delight, it also gets copious compliments."
River is my all-time favorite.
"buying bagged dirt/mulch/rock/etc from big box stores is MUCH more expensive than buying from a landscape materials yard...assuming you need a truckload or more.  Sometimes you just need a few cubic feet though.

When I was remodeling my wife's house, now a rental property, there was a Tru Value hardware store about a mile away.  Tru Value wasn't just a little more expensive, they were a LOT.  Like each copper pipe fitting was 2-3x as much.

So it pays to know what stuff costs, and where."
Most redditors' perception of humour correlates inversely with how intelligent they think they will sound by correcting you.
I like vanilla because I can add whatever I feel like to it at the time. I also just like the plain flavor at times.
"I wouldn't say there's ""no need"" really. Most cameras are more expensive because the quality is better. Beyond resolution and frame rate there are lots of features that affect video quality

Obviously don't take out a small business loan to buy a $10,000 camera if you're just starting out and you're not sure if it's for you

However there's SO MUCH competition on twitch. For the most part if someone's camera or mic just looks or sounds like shit most people aren't going to bother giving that streamer a chance. Then instead of growing and having fun they're left wondering why no one wants to watch them stream 

Everyone's experience will vary but I think it's a bad idea to assume the bottom shelf gear will be good enough to grow your channel. Unless you're just the most charming person on the planet of course

If $17 is what you can afford then go for it! I'm not judging you. 

If you CAN afford more though then you'll have a leg up on everyone else's production value. For some people like me that's important as a viewer"
My university is not there so I trust the list.
No one talks about his use of weed because he admited to doing harder drugs and he didn't use a ridiculous line like i smoked but did not inhale. Also you can't criticize Obama's drug use without being a racist.

"Am I the only one who came to this thread hoping the top comment would be something like ""you can just buy a bag of this special sand on Amazon and refill your filters dozens of times for $20""?"

"the ""good bacteria"" are good because they compete with the bad bacteria, therefore they reduce the number of bad bacteria. If you can just reduce the number of all bacteria then you dont have a need for the good bacteria.


This only applies to the mouth, good bacteria in other parts of the body perform different functions."
Condoms.  Your life will change if you DON'T use them!
"> i cant even make a case for it

I wouldn't go that far even if I agree that Liverpool should be higher. United being more prominent in recent years, winning a treble, being the first english team to win it and the romance of the Busby Babes are all things which might sway voters"
"For something arcade like: Forza Horizon 3, Grid, NFS. For something that like a simulation: Project cars, Assetto Corsa, iRacing. If you want to customize a car, there is Car Mechanic Simulator"
