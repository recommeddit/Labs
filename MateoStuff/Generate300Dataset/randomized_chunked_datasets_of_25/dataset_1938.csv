46523,best trick or treating candy,"Texan here. I love Snickers, but it's hot here, so M&Ms are good enough. In case Mars Corp is watching, I think they should make a Snickers M&M...a comprehensive candy that won't melt all over your hands while you're trying to eat it."
17538,best iOS game,marvel strike force. Marvel characters. Good graphics. Good tactical turned base combat. Reasonably f2p friendly.
10933,best backpack for college,"I've carried [this](https://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Madrone-Cycling-Backpack-Full-Cycle/dp/B00E1O2DK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) Timbuk2 backpack for ~5 years now and it's still going strong. I especially like how waterproof it is - I've never had anything inside get wet, even walking around in pouring rain."
67992,best science fiction novel,"JDE was a serialized net blog that a Cracked.com writer was doing on the side, just for fun, probably while high, and it got big enough to be marginally edited and crammed into book form. The author barely have any sort of a shit at all. 

Spiders was planned as a book, and mostly written while not high. 

So yeah, there's some pretty good reasons for the books to be very different."
14749,best romantic novel,I love that people love this one as much as me! This is tied with Kulti for my favorite of hers and I reread them annually at least.
66308,best soccer team in the world,"Yeah I was thinking about this a lot when it was posted and I honestly think we should just be joint rated at this point.

 You have more trophies and some great moments like Istanbul, but we have the only English treble and more recent success.

I think a joint rating would be the most fair"

17332,best iOS game,"That game rules, though."
26579,best board games,"I guess I left it off because it’s got much more name recognition than these, so most people already know about it and it wouldn’t contribute as much to the list. 

I agree, though, that it’s a good gateway game. I was really into Catan for awhile which ended up feeding my interest in more board games."
33682,best electric car,"Exactly why I pulled the trigger on mine, zero regrets. It's a monster."

55974,best action and adventure movie,"It’s not good... sorry.

Saw it a few weeks ago and I so wanted it to be good, but it’s just not. Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce do the best they can, but it’s a disappointingly muddled madness that completely lacks any sort of satisfying cohesion, charm or a decent supporting cast. There's some good stuff in there, but it's frustratingly fleeting. There's a random, episodic nature about it that falls terribly flat and the whole affair feels quite aged already, as though the script hasn't been updated in the intervening years of failed attempts (except the on-the-nose references to said failed productions). The idea just doesn't work very well and it doesn't really feel like Gilliam... feels like someone trying to do an early-Gilliam and not understanding what made those film special.

Hey, that’s my two cents... I hope you tell me to stick it, “you’re so wrong!” and you enjoy it when you see it!"
40396,best midrange GPU,"They're canadian.

For context, the 2060 KO is $448.97 CAD."
23021,best celebrity,"I've met Al numerous times. There are 2 Als you get, Weird Al and genuine Al. If someone goes up to him and is all goofy, they are gonna get Weird Al. The next person could go up and just be appreciative of him and they will get genuine Al. You can see it in interviews too. If the interviewer is asking questions that are just stupid and they're only asking him because he calls himself Weird, then he is gonna put on a show. But if they ask him questions like any other celebrity out comes genuine Al."
48236,best color to paint with,"That's why you select the finishes in the same kind of light that will be in the room. And not to sound dickish, but if you can't see a range of whites you might be partially colorblind."
