55974,"It’s not good... sorry.

Saw it a few weeks ago and I so wanted it to be good, but it’s just not. Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce do the best they can, but it’s a disappointingly muddled madness that completely lacks any sort of satisfying cohesion, charm or a decent supporting cast. There's some good stuff in there, but it's frustratingly fleeting. There's a random, episodic nature about it that falls terribly flat and the whole affair feels quite aged already, as though the script hasn't been updated in the intervening years of failed attempts (except the on-the-nose references to said failed productions). The idea just doesn't work very well and it doesn't really feel like Gilliam... feels like someone trying to do an early-Gilliam and not understanding what made those film special.

Hey, that’s my two cents... I hope you tell me to stick it, “you’re so wrong!” and you enjoy it when you see it!",best action and adventure movie

The next person could go up and just be appreciative of him and they will get genuine Al. You can see it in interviews too. If the interviewer is asking questions that are just stupid and they're only asking him because he calls himself Weird, then he is gonna put on a show. But if they ask him questions like any other celebrity out comes genuine Al.",best celebrity
