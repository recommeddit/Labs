Granola mixed with greek yogurt. Top with local honey and a few berries
Wow. What's a molasses kiss? I like molasses cookies but I think I'd have to pass on molasses candy.
On meh.com today there is one of those balls you control with your smartphone.  That looks pretty fun.
Instrumental movie soundtracks are what I used.
"It's mostly due to his parents, who never allowed his child fame to grow into his head and never gave him special treatment.

One of my favorite stories of him is, when he won the audition for Harry Potter way back when, his parents awarded him by letting him watch TV for an hour more past his bedtime."
"**Overall:**  
**Scott=Kim>Kourt>Rob>Khloe>Kylie>Kris>kendall** 

Kim is my favorite, I think she is really funny/a diva but have never heard of her being rude to fans etc. 

Kourt was tied for my fav growing up but her personality has changed a lot in the last like four years and now she is not as funny/kind of annoying at times but i don't dislike her. I feel bad for Khloe tbh but she has been annoying me lately as well with blaming others for everything. 

I really dislike Kris she is just too much for me (ever since the first season she is just sooo obnoxious). Kylie has no personality and just looks so fake now and talks weird. Kendall annoys me lol she's so whiney and has no sense of humor. Loved Rob in the early episodes but now he clearly has a lot of issues."
I'm dying for it to finally go on sale since it was released for Linux. I'll play the shit out of that.
"When I asked my dental hygenist this question, she told me that some toothpastes (typically those not ADA approved) are rougher on your enamel and to look for the ADA seal."
"Garfield was a terrific Spider-Man, but my least favorite Peter Parker. Hipster douchebag Peter Parker is honestly so far removed from how he should be.

I accept it as an alternative vision for the character, I read lots of comics, I'm used to this sort of thing (I really liked Lex in BvS for example). But there were points where I couldn't see the core of the character anymore.

But as far as Spiderman goes, he nailed the quippyness and the energy."

"You have any recommendations for the Summer? Looking to buy one today, not sure which one to get(first time buyer). 

My friend let me borrow Versace cologne a couple years ago and I liked that, but wondering if there is one that is better that I should go for"
"I have a GE that has been great. My dad gave it to me. He owned it probably 10 years. I have had it for 3. No signs of it stopping. With that being said, I have to tell you that I hate the chest freezer and my next one will be a stand up freezer because then you can actually organize it and SEE what you have. I feel like I cannot fill the chest freezer to capacity because then I cannot get to things at the bottom. It blows. So I would really consider that when looking. 

As far as not losing meat, I have a thermometer on it that is wireless. It sounds an alarm to a home base (located in my kitchen) when the temp rises above freezing. It’s very helpful. I wish I would have sprung for the one that is WiFi compatible as well however. That way I could monitor it even when not at home. So far have had no issues while away though, but you never know."
"To be honest I don't know what mixing is, what's the difference between that and production?"
"Yes, and it made things worse. The mic generally stays up, but now you get video drop outs!

Got a bunch of BRIO's at work with various 2.x firmwares on them, but the two we have on 2.7 are pretty much useless on non-Windows machines now. For affected machines we've swapped out some 2.4 BRIO's to leave the 2.7's on Windows boxes, and are now using a third party mic with the 2.4's.

My 1.x BRIO at home is going strong and will never get updated.

We live and hope that Logitech will come to their senses and realise there's more than just Windows users out there."
"I would too!  Anyone want that, just DM me your number and I'll text you on Christmas and maybe send you some pics of the fam."
You are not.
This shit made me extremely uncomfortable but I loved it. Write a story with these.
Hahah yes bro!
I deleted it because it was incredibly poorly phrased.
MIDNIGHT CLUB FOREVER! What an amazing experience!
Is that like a purse? I’m not sure what you mean by pouches.

"In Apple Arcade, Guildlings is really good. Unfortunately they release it in parts and it’s been almost a year since since it’s been out. Still worth the play through.

"As a homer, I agree. But this is pff and their ""projection"" for next year, so it'll be fun when he shocks them runs for 2.5k and wins mvp"
