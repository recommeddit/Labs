If I was to make and selection changes, I'd swap Infinity War for Dr. Strange."

27118,best board games,"I appreciate your note on the art. That alone is the reason why I don't own a copy. As an elitist graphic designer snob, I find that the component/art/design quality unfairly skews my enjoyment of a game, or lack thereof. 

For example, I love Everdell and Abyss probably a bit more than they deserve!"

3108,best webcamera,"Isnt it because most webcams still use USB 2.0 which is limited in bandwith for like 1080p 60fps? 

It would be fine on 3.0, but that costs extra, and manufacturers don't wanna spend more than they have to.

And then, they don't exactly go for the nicest sensor possible, because that would also bring the price up.

I'm seriously thinking about picking up a dedicated ""point'n'shoot"" cam to replace mine."
4113,best online college,"A lot of universities offer online degrees now - like, actual brick and mortar schools that just offer the same degrees online now.

What you want to confirm is that 1) the degree actually shows that it's from that institution, not a sub-organization that operates under the university and 2) that people can actually complete the curriculum through 100% online classes. Some will seem like they're 100% online, but there will be times when you have to show up on campus a few times. 

For example, my state school has MBAs for 13k, instate or out of state. You're not going to get the connections you'd get sitting in class with a bunch of Chads, but you'll get the diploma with the same letters on it. If you're just looking for something to meet a qualification, I'd go this route."

68423,best science fiction novel,Not OP but that's one of my favorites. Very influential. I love the way you don't realize that it's a sci-fi book at first. I think it's one of those books that you have to read twice.
40936,best instrument to play,"Middle school band director here.  I teach 5-8th grade US.  In my experience the EASIEST wind instrument to learn is the saxophone.  

Consider the following if you please:

1) The first octave follows a very logical finger sequence of adding or taking away one button at a time.  This allows for some simple melody duplication without much training.

2) The “closed” hole keys take out the dexterity problem that flutes, clarinets, oboes, and bassoons tend to struggle with early on.  AKA button-mash-a-phones. 

3) There is little effort needed to blow a consistent tone.  Even a loose, unfocused, embouchure can achieve a characteristic tone (depending on what music you like to emulate)

4) the second octave is “only one button away.” Considering that the octave key does not change register, leaving the fingering structure unchanged, the range of songs you can copy by ear just doubled.  

There are a lot of excellent comments here.  And I agree with those of you who find the piano to be the easiest but, only if you’re only playing with one hand.  I can’t fathom trying to learn the piano seriously without teaching two hands within the first few weeks, and that’s where some of my “less than focused” students really begin to struggle.  In my experience, the saxophone students RARELY struggle and I have to constantly feed them harder material to keep up their practice momentum."

59141,best perfume,"I don't wear it anymore, but a lot of people *flip* over Juicy Couture's Viva la Juicy. I used to carry a rollerball when I was in college in case I felt gross after walking across campus, and people would always comment on it when I walked into a classroom."
36731,best alcoholic drink,"If it’s a nicer bar or a restaurant and they have a drink menu, they’ll normally have a few different options listed, and will list what’s in the drink. In general, anything above the house Margarita is probably going to be decent. But you’ll learn over time what liquors and mixers you prefer. Grand marnier or Cointreau versus cheap triple sec, a smooth añejo or reposado tequila versus Cuervo silver or a mixto ‘tequila’.

The ‘drink menu with multiple margarita options’ thing may vary based on where you live. I’m in texas so margaritas are practically their own food group."
