"The front facing camera on smartphones do have a better sensor and lens than most webcams, **but that is not the whole story.**

Video and photos on a smartphone go through a ton of **real time software processing** in order to look that good. A ton of uncompressed raw data is sent directly from the camera sensor straight to the phone's SOC to be processed. I am talking about **several gigabits per second.** Way too much for USB 2 or even USB 3. USB 3.2 10Gbps might be able to handle that.

Compare this to a webcam. The sensor captures the image and then a **super cheap processor** in the webcam handles all the image processing and compression before the video feed is sent over USB2 to the PC.

In theory, you can make a webcam that basically has a smartphone SOC inside it that does all the sophisticated image processing that smartphone cameras can do. However, once you do that, the price of the webcam ballons quickly. Once a webcam costs $300+, it is tough to justify compared to something like a cheap used DSLR.

People seem to forget that USB webcams were a dying product category pre-COVID. No one gave a sh** about them for about a decade after every laptop and phone started coming with built in cameras."

And yes, there is plenty more where that came from, as long as you weren't being facetious :)"

"Soap and water work well if you actually have stuff on your hands - dirt, grime, fecal matter, that kind of stuff. There's a good chance simply removing that crap from your hands in a third-world country would improve things. Soap helps do this better than water alone. 

With otherwise clean hands, however, soap and water only shows a ~1.5 log reduction in bacterial counts, which is pretty poor. Ethanol based hand sanitizers (60-95%) work significantly better than this. So... you're still wrong.

Edit: btw, I think the article I referenced is available for free online at pubmed. It's a thick volume so you probably won't be interested in reading all of it, but there is a ton of good information in there."
Thatâ€™s amazing! I saw him on tour and he was hilarious.  He seems like he would be energetic in person
This sounds awesome!!

"I think it's kind of like basic fridges, all pretty similar. Get a vacuum sealer and don't get frost free."

"I just visited the Amazon link, top question was ""Does this already have Windows 7 on it?"" Made my night. Oh, and of course someone had to answer with ""no it has windows 8."""

"Not my purchase but my parents but it's for me so it technically counts - my ADD meds, back in third grade it became so bad that I zoned out for the whole day and just stared at the wall or something getting nothing done. After the meds i became a good student and could actually focus, its since gotten better but the procrastination has stayed and is still really bad"

"manziâ€™s super quiet and right by carrillo. Thereâ€™s like 4ish bathrooms per hallway with one stall + shower inside and you can lock the door, so not communal (obv everyone uses the same bathrooms but you get a lot more privacy this way)."

"Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame.

Tall as fuck, and really cheerful. I was working the front desk for Newbury Comics' corporate office and he and his assistant came in. I didn't even process the name when his assistant said it, just called back to the buyer whom Bruce was meeting. Then it hit me: ""Wait. **The** Bruce Campbell""?

Bruce is standing to my right, looming like death. He smiles, extends a hand, laughs, and asks me my name. I made the requisite boomstick joke, and he also laughed at that.

Much better behaved than Juliette Lewis, who showed up so drunk she couldn't walk down the ramp in front of me."
"There isn't much in terms of monsters, you're right, but the books have a lot of adventures, close calls, clever plots, etc. Plus, the characters are awesome!"
