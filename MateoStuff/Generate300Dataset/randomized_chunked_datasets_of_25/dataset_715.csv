70758,best movies with a cool twist,"It came across as one of those ""this probably sounded so much better in the writer's head when he pitched it"" projects."
50507,best rap album,yeah the production on that is def dope. but i feel like it has some filler. at the same time it has some of my favorite tracks of all time aswell tho.
43020,best detective show,LOL
8283,best toothpaste,"Seconding this. I couldn’t floss when I had braces, and when we finally got a Waterpik I was astounded/horrified. SO MUCH food came out even when used after brushing. And it was really fun to use! Highly recommend"
73549,best battery bank,"Can recommend Mophie - have bought myself a 30,000mAh for £37, which I love. It's heavy but I don't mind. I also bought a Mophie 10,000mAh as a gift for a family member. Both have had heavy use, with almost no wear and tear, and both still perform well."
19125,best YouTube video,"GraystillPlays.

Man is hilarious."

72220,best adblocker extension,[uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)*. It's the original and it's different from ublock.
55444,best action and adventure novel series,The Riyria Revelations by Michael Sullivan might be something you'd like. I'm now about 100 page sinto the first book Theft of Swords and it is pretty much a fighter and a rogue having adventures after being wrongly accused of killing the king.
56847,best desktop monitor,"What about the AOC24G2, I thought it was regarded as the best 1080p IPS 144hz monitor? How are the Acer or Viewsonic better ?"
70246,best major to study in college,"A degree alone in Computer Science just isn’t the ticket it once was. Nowadays, you need projects, a good GitHub, tons of extracurriculars, etc etc. The degree is almost meaningless nowadays, and tech companies are even moving away from them."
20577,best workout music,"I love M.I.A. ""Bad Girls"", A$AP Rocky's ""Fucking Problems"", and NONONO's ""Pumpin Blood"" while working out."
68117,best science fiction novel,"I've not seen many people talking about Fall of Hyperion or its ending. I loved the first book but only got halfway into the second. I didn't dislike it or intentionally stop reading, but I didn't find it nearly as interesting as the first. I'm going to have to pick it up again."
16792,best pet for toddlers,"Age three is when cooperative play becomes such a thing. 

I wouldn't get a dog in this case. I'd take all the money and monthly budget I would have spent on a dog and enroll him in a couple of playgroup-type classes, group music like Kindermusic, toddler gym, and of course, there are free activities like library story (and craft) time. Kids' museum, playgrounds and parks, Rec Department classes, etc. 

You could also join a local playdate group through a mothers' club and go to weekend playdates. 

We started a co-op preschool around that age."

39164,best web browser,"Opera, I've been testing for a while Vivaldi but it's some kind of buggy.

Opera for me it's the fastest, open quickly, browse quickly and I'm using a lot of extensions so its the right in my opinion"
36006,best alcoholic drink,"The calories from the carbs in beer would *help* your workout, if anything. What's actually hurting your workouts is the alcohol itself.  
  
So basically the answer is no."
24279,best anime,I checked it and it’s another solid list though I heavily disagree with the Eva Rebuild 2.0 being rated higher than NGE or EoE.
36254,best alcoholic drink,I wasn't sure if I had to add an AH for asshole or just an A.

27477,best bollywood actor,Dilip Kumar
6981,best iPhone,"I wanted to buy the iPhone 11 but I bought the 11 Pro because of the size, oled, and thinner bezels."
45962,best trick or treating candy,I would say chocolate. The reasons are that for one thing I'm a chocaholic lol and it's also completely safe and parent-nag free for kids with braces.
