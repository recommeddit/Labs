5968,"It really depends on what you want to do.
If you want to make Web Applications or Websites with really strong interactive experiences - Javascript is absolutely essential.

You'll need to understand the interaction and overlap of HTML (App Structure), CSS (App Styling) and Javascript (App Behavior). Knowing this is 50% of the battle!

If you're planning on focusing on *just* the front end - those 3 will get you extremely far and you could easily have a very successful career.

If you want to dig into the backend as well, then you'll need a server-side language.
Depending on your familiarity with Javascript, you can use it there too. Otherwise you can choose between a wealth of offerings (PHP/Python/Java/C#/Etc...).

Picking one is the hard part! It's worth trying a few beginner tutorials in the most common ones and see what you gel with best. Take a look a Job Boards for your region and see which are the most popular and what they pay - you want to maximize your employability!",best programming language for web development

And on [Derrick Brooks'](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/derrick-brooks/) HOF page you can see it lists him as a 6x all pro, despite only making 5 AP first teams. Similarly, [Larry Allen is noted as making 7 straight first team all pros](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/larry-allen/), but only made 6 straight AP first teams (the 7th one was a SN first team all pro).

The AP is the most well known and often used, but the other matter just the same according to the NFL.",best NFL player

39590,"Sawbones {https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sawbones-podcast/sawbones} is more Hardcore Medicine than biology but may scratch your itch of what youre looking for. 

They explore the history of ailments and early methods of treatments. There's 2 hosts, a husband and wife. The wife is very knowledgeable and a doctor while the husband tries to interject with humor. The humor didnt work for me; I wished he would shutup and just let his wife talk, but thats their dynamic. 

Topical podcasts (Stuff You Should Know/Caustic Soda(defunct)) often cover the history certain diseases and how it shaped the ancient and modern world in detail. 

Also, philosopher Nick Bostrom has done a few podcasts. Hes actually the opposite of what youre looking for: he doesnt focus on the history of biology, rather the future of it and how the human race will become extinct, whether be from asteroid to AI to a superbug. Hes very interesting and may pique your interest.",best podcast for biologists
