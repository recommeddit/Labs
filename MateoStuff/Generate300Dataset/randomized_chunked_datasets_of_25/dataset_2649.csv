65100,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Their mini bowl is a whole ass meal. Looks tiny but I almost didn't finish it.
5968,best programming language for web development,"It really depends on what you want to do.
If you want to make Web Applications or Websites with really strong interactive experiences - Javascript is absolutely essential.

You'll need to understand the interaction and overlap of HTML (App Structure), CSS (App Styling) and Javascript (App Behavior). Knowing this is 50% of the battle!

If you're planning on focusing on *just* the front end - those 3 will get you extremely far and you could easily have a very successful career.

If you want to dig into the backend as well, then you'll need a server-side language.
Depending on your familiarity with Javascript, you can use it there too. Otherwise you can choose between a wealth of offerings (PHP/Python/Java/C#/Etc...).

Picking one is the hard part! It's worth trying a few beginner tutorials in the most common ones and see what you gel with best. Take a look a Job Boards for your region and see which are the most popular and what they pay - you want to maximize your employability!"
37067,best amusement park,"Kings Dominion is the obvious answer if you've never been - it's a shorter drive than Busch Gardens and one of the best parks in the Cedar Fair chain.

Pennsylvania parks like Hershey and Knoebels are also great answers. Knoebels in particular is a really unique family owned park that gets [tons of praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/6siqq8/dorney_knoebels_trip_report_august_5_2017/?st=jhtbue18&sh=95090906) in this sub."

46335,best trick or treating candy,Remember that teenagers sometimes just want candy too! Don't act rude if they show up. They normally don't want to cause trouble. They just want candy and aren't willing to spend the money.
34883,best NFL player,"[Yep](https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/NFLPA/CBA2020/NFL-NFLPA_CBA_March_5_2020.pdf). On page 136 you see that all 3 (and also SI) count the same for contract bonuses. And on [Derrick Brooks'](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/derrick-brooks/) HOF page you can see it lists him as a 6x all pro, despite only making 5 AP first teams. Similarly, [Larry Allen is noted as making 7 straight first team all pros](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/larry-allen/), but only made 6 straight AP first teams (the 7th one was a SN first team all pro).

The AP is the most well known and often used, but the other matter just the same according to the NFL."
40217,best midrange CPU,Yeah but was talking more along the line of those 16threads the series x and PS5 are going to have
7229,best iPhone,I'm glad to hear that!
39590,best podcast for biologists,"Sawbones {https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sawbones-podcast/sawbones} is more Hardcore Medicine than biology but may scratch your itch of what youre looking for. 

They explore the history of ailments and early methods of treatments. There's 2 hosts, a husband and wife. The wife is very knowledgeable and a doctor while the husband tries to interject with humor. The humor didnt work for me; I wished he would shutup and just let his wife talk, but thats their dynamic. 

Topical podcasts (Stuff You Should Know/Caustic Soda(defunct)) often cover the history certain diseases and how it shaped the ancient and modern world in detail. 

Also, philosopher Nick Bostrom has done a few podcasts. Hes actually the opposite of what youre looking for: he doesnt focus on the history of biology, rather the future of it and how the human race will become extinct, whether be from asteroid to AI to a superbug. Hes very interesting and may pique your interest."
