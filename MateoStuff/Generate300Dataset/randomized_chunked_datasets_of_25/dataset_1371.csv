38594,best newspapers to read,"I grew up reading The Indian Express and was a loyal reader till I noticed a recent unabashedly pro-Congress tilt in everything they reported. Stopped reading it anymore.

Just yesterday someone here said TOI is too big and rich a media house to be pushed around by political parties. Honestly, I like their Mumbai coverage but I simply skip their Bollywood and cricket stories.

DNA is a good paper. Balanced coverage. Hyperlocal.

I abhor The Hindu for its Leftist stance and tendency to edit out news they feel should not be outed."

8303,best toothpaste,I got a water flosser after I was diagnosed with periodontal disease. It works wonders. Apparently you aren’t supposed to bleed every time you brush your teeth! Who knew?!
8960,best toothpaste,"Okay, between this and other posts I'll buy that whitening doesn't work and that toothpastes stretch the magnitude of their effects as a selling point.

What about toothpaste for sensitive teeth?  My teeth are pretty sensitive, and whitening toothpaste actually gives me headaches after using it.  Because of this, I switched to a toothpaste for sensitivity.  Is there anything in these that could reasonably impact either immediate (as you're brushing) or longer-term (throughout the day, week, etc) sensitivity?  Or is it all a placebo?"
