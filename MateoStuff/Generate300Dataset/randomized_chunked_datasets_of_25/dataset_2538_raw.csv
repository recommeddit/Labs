Have you ever tried just the mixer?
"Put a small gun in it.  You will have to check it, and it will be visibly marked as a package carrying a gun. I GUARANTEE that bag will not go missing. Guns do not go missing in the airport. They are handled differently and have different security measures. 

My friends fly with super expensive camera gear a lot, and when they do, they put a small shitty gun in the bag.  The check process is a bit longer (5-10 minutes)  but i promise you, that bag/case will make it to your destination safely and soundly."
I agree with 1-10 tho
"That's because they mix with oils in your skin and some other things, so even if the brand is good, it might not be the best for you, that's why you must keep trying new things until you find the one you feel is the best for you, or at least decent"
"I guess I've never really been that big into running and if something felt comfortable I'd end up just using it :o I play hockey and volleyball so most of my exercise just comes from playing and I'll throw in short runs at lunch time or something if I feel like my cardio is failing (it's been nice to get away while WFH during covid also).

I think the only place around me is Roadrunner but I usually buy my shoes on clearance (i.e. I'll buy last year's model when they're like 30% off or something when new versions come out) or in this case I'm just going to buy them online from Nike. I always felt kind of weird having someone watch me run then feeling obligated to buy a shoe when I don't really want to buy one from there..."
"One of my favourite books too! So fresh, so sweet and so amazing I read it in one sitting!"
"No clue.  True story: we've never once used it for a frozen pizza.  But if it's like everything else we use it for, you just throw that bad boy on there for a while until its sizzing and then you look at it.  You can eyeball pretty much everything with it."
"I've been blown out by the smell. I have an older version, not sure about the newest. It lasts around 8 hours, projecting maybe 3 to 4 hours then it's subtle. So yeah, projection is not great."
"no i know, but where's the actual list you're talking about"
"May I ask, which country is not supported by Google IAP?

 Do they support the Google Play store for downloading the app?"
"Cheap games that are amazing:
- **Love letter**
- **Hanabi**
- **Skulls**
- **Resistance** or **Avalon**
- **Star Realms**
- **Machi Koro**
- **Battle Line**
- **Aton**
- **Jaipur**

Must Haves:
- **7 Wonders**
- **Pandemic**
- **Caverna** (updates **Agricola**)
- **Dominion** (will also need at least 1 expansion though)
- **Ticket to Ride**
- **Power Grid**

Personal Favorites:
- **Twilight Struggle**
- **Eclipse** (terribly long setup time though)
- **Netrunner** (though this is a hobby on its own)
- **Game of Thrones boardgame**
- **Dominant Species**


Also do not underestimate the wallet draining effect of buying into Fantasy Flight games (Netrunner, X-Wing, Arkham Horror). They go mad with expansions and you will want them all!"
Heart gold is a remake of gold right? I adore gold and crystal so I’m sure I’d love heart gold! Thanks for the suggestion will be buying it!
i think it just hasnt been approved yet because it has a shit ton of links... the mods have a spam filter on that i probably activated with that post. :)

"I just want to add that PHP is a powerhouse language to know, especially if you are interested in building full-stack applications and need to know some sort of backend language.

Laravel/Lumen are **amazing** and take most of the good bits from Ruby on Rails. 

The latest version of Laravel comes with Vue.js builtin and makes developing frontend thin-clients with PHP backends super easy. The way that you can template out resources (JSON) for APIs is fan-fucking-tastic.

PHP gets its share of historical hate, but really v7 is just great."

"I am also a bass player and I agree, but plenty of people ignorantly chalk up bass as just the ""easy guitar"" and give no credit to what it takes to actually *be* a bass player, not just *play the bass*."

In my case a 28kwh Ioniq had better value even if it was a little bit more expensive.

I would just count any mention of clannad as a vote for the whole thing. Whether you list that as clannad franchise or just clannad after story is up to you. Idk if you've seen clannad but there is no chance anyone would ever mention it on a list and not be meaning the whole thing. It's just often referred to as just clannad."
