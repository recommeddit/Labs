I don't like turn based RPGs, and I'm not a huge anime fan... but Persona 5 is easily one of my favorite games of all time.   and it has a solid 5 star rating with 12k votes on the PlayStation store... that's the highest I've ever seen of any game, period."
12094,best gifts for dad,"I got into it because of the cost.  I bought a bulk order of Feather razors five years ago for thirty bucks and it's just now running out.  So now that I'm not spending fifteen-twenty bucks a month on cartridges, I can splurge a little on a nice brush and cream.

69934,best major to study in college,"Be ready for long hours and lots of stress. A lot of people just look at the glitz and the glamor. They don't take into account getting on set at 6 AM to load in. Or 12 hour days, 6 days a week to film a series, for a month or more at a time. If you're ready for this, be prepared to jump from job to job because a show/film isn't done for years at a time like most jobs."

10746,best suitcase lock,"Yes, they will.  The gun has to be in a locked, secure container, but that container doesn't have to be a gun-specific case.  It can be a large lockable suitcase with all your other luggage also secured.  It's a fairly common tactic among security-paranoid travelers to pack a gun in with your other stuff specifically to get the special treatment.

The TSA still opens the bag to confirm the contents, but they do so with you present.  It's then locked with a non-TSA lock and not opened again until you collect it at your destination."
