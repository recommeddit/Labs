7537,best laptop for general use,"Hi, your budget is plenty large for a good general use device. If you don't MacOS, the Apple MacBook Air on my list is one of the best value options out there. Great performance, low weight, good battery life, etc."

60248,best freezer brand,"In that case, self-defrost is a reasonable option, and I think there are some self-defrosting chest fridges now. Still, anything kept in it for more than a few months is going to get freezer burn from repeated surface thawing."
21970,best celebrity,"I didn't actually meet him, but Tracy Morgan bought my younger sister an iphone many years ago.  Hers broke, and his gf, now wife, at the time lost her phone at the Superbowl or something so that's why he was at the same Verizon store.  

The Verizon employee said my sister's damage wasn't covered under insurance and my mom couldn't afford to buy her a new phone, and my sister I guess clearly got emotional because Tracy Morgan, who had been talking to my mom for a bit before while they were waiting (my mom and sister had NO idea who he was until my dad came in and recognized him) bought the phone for her.  

My mom tried to say no but he said to just pay it forward."
46347,best trick or treating candy,"Lets kids TAKE one piece, makes sure we don't get gross candy. Porch light on means your open, off means closed. Generally one or two pieces, depending on time of the night or whether you're in a high traffic neighborhood.

Don't gibe out almond joys, generally kids don't like them. However parents usually do. Straight chocolate or big lollipops are always good. Pretzels and gummies work, I always liked those. Don't do the popcorn thing, just annoying and they get crushed anyways."
18880,best YouTube video,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHK__BafDmU

Here's one by Ephemeral Rift. He has this very interesting Fallout/Borderlands/Lovecraft/Everything else themed world called the Rift, with many many many peculiar characters like the Candy Man, Plaque Doctor Corvus Clemmons, Green Man, Chris Crinkle... And all of it is extremely tinglelicious."

1475,best ice cream flavor,"Top 3: Anything chocolate based with chocolate flakes, Swiss Orange Chip which is a chocolate orange base, and Vanilla bean.
