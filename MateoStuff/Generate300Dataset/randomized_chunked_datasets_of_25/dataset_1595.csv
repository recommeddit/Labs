65417,"[Teltik](http://teltik.com/),  a T-Mobile business line reseller, is always consistently left out of these types of lists, in favor of more expensive, and less competitive offerings. You have to have an EIN or a screenshot of an Ebay/Shopify storefront/other proof of having a business to qualify, but once you do, it is an excellent service.

Unlimited talk, text, data, for $40/mo (plus $3.5 taxes and fees) makes it an excellent choice. Plus it's postpaid priority, you still get T-mobile Tuesdays, and excellent support. IMHO, it should have been mentioned in both ""Best Premium Unlimited Data Plans"" and potentially the ""Best Value Unlimited Data Plans"" categories as well.",best phone service company

3952,"I got my master's degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois. I took mostly online courses because I registered for classes late and they were my only option.  This turned out to be advantageous because the classes were 2 hours instead of 3 like the on-campus classes. The online classes met on campus one day each semester to account for shorter class time. 

A lot if schools are offering online classes that are just as valid as if you attended on-campus. Makes it easy when you have a job in addition to school. 

In terms of finding a job with my degree: one month after I finished my degree, I found a high level job as Associate Director and Head of Reference at a library in the area I wanted to live. 

I'm so glad I got my degrees, even if I don't use them directly in my current career. I gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunities or encountered the scenarios to learn otherwise. 

Tldr: I got a masters and I'm quite glad that I did.",best online college
