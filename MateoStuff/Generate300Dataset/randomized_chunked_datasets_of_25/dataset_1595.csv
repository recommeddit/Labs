45068,best items under $100,"I never heard of an air couch until two hours ago when the inflatable hot tub I bought on Craigslist came with a wrinkled flyer in the instruction manual for one.

And now I'm wondering what the hell is going on with the universe. This can't be a coincidence. Am I real? Is this part of the simulation?"

141,best terminal file manager reddit,"Can you recomend any good plugins? I also use dolphin but just the base version with some icon previews and ""ark"""
65417,best phone service company,"[Teltik](http://teltik.com/),  a T-Mobile business line reseller, is always consistently left out of these types of lists, in favor of more expensive, and less competitive offerings. You have to have an EIN or a screenshot of an Ebay/Shopify storefront/other proof of having a business to qualify, but once you do, it is an excellent service.

Unlimited talk, text, data, for $40/mo (plus $3.5 taxes and fees) makes it an excellent choice. Plus it's postpaid priority, you still get T-mobile Tuesdays, and excellent support. IMHO, it should have been mentioned in both ""Best Premium Unlimited Data Plans"" and potentially the ""Best Value Unlimited Data Plans"" categories as well."

Emotional , strong heroine with plot that makes you think more deeply about the world. No one writes like her. Kingmaker and Grip series are my favorite."
58807,best cologne,"Chrome Azzaro is my favorite scent.  I use it all seasons and all times of day.  It's not super strong, but it definitely does smell nice and attract people when you come in close contact."

8583,best toothpaste,"Gum that contains xylitol can help to kill plaque bacteria, as well as increase saliva (which contains enamel rebuilding minerals) significantly more than plain gum.

Trident contains xylitol, but because xylitol is expensive, they only use like 5%, which doesn't do anything.

Buy 100% xylitol gum."

41427,best instrument to play,Yeah. I'm not going to teach myself.
3952,best online college,"I got my master's degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois. I took mostly online courses because I registered for classes late and they were my only option.  This turned out to be advantageous because the classes were 2 hours instead of 3 like the on-campus classes. The online classes met on campus one day each semester to account for shorter class time. 

A lot if schools are offering online classes that are just as valid as if you attended on-campus. Makes it easy when you have a job in addition to school. 

In terms of finding a job with my degree: one month after I finished my degree, I found a high level job as Associate Director and Head of Reference at a library in the area I wanted to live. 

I'm so glad I got my degrees, even if I don't use them directly in my current career. I gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunities or encountered the scenarios to learn otherwise. 

Tldr: I got a masters and I'm quite glad that I did."
