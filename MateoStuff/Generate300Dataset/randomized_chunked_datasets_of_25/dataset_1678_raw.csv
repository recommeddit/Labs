Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Costumes are a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm more of a watcher. (Wait that sounds creepy).
"Sounds like where I work, oddly enough. Which is also a small and local lumberyard."
So far I’m thinking Atlantis Bahamas it’s like super inclusive for two is only like $4000 and for real literally every post lately has been the same kind of answers
"Mindhunter although it was not renewed. I really liked Narcos & Breaking Bad. And if you have access to HBO - Mare of Easttown

Edit. Oops. Looks like there might be a new season of Mindhunter!"
Wait wait.  Do I listen to the comments or to the guide?
Rambo: first blood is a classic and imo is one of the best films ever in terms of consistency
"tbqh, as someone who has been flat broke and homeless before, just a budget mobile phone is quite life changing. not having access to basic modern technology and the information and resources it provides totally cuts people off from almost every aspect of modern society"
"This is boring but a fire kit! Blanket, gloves, ladder and extinguisher."
The Texas rebate expires at the end of the year anyway.
"We came across a nice little drink about a month ago from a friend call mini beer shots. Its licor 43 and heavy cream on top. It looks like a mini beer and its not stingy at all going down. the cream really makes the drink taste wonderful.

"This reads like a hotel-management montage early in an *Ocean’s* movie—complete with Brad Pitt voiceover.

EDIT: Thanks for the unexpected rewards on my late-night/early-morning nonsense, lol. The reason I said this specifically is because Brad Pitt’s character manages a hotel in at least the first one of those movies—and that franchise loves its narrated montage."
"I’m intrigued, what was it called?"
"That's naturopathy. Homeopathy actually measures it's ""effectiveness"" by how *diluted* it is. Like, 30x dilute is somehow *better* than 10x. You have less of the thing but it somehow works better? Homeopathy is bunk, but naturopathy works. Licorice root tea feels better on a sore throat than any cough drop I've ever had, lidocaine ones included."
I loved those Bulls and Jordan. I enjoyed Last Dance a fair amount but it is a little unrefined in some elements.
"I have a 1440p Dell, 24"" I believe and its absolutely amazing. Vesa mount, great colors (and corrections), bright and 144hz."
"In the review, Linus states that it isn't all that reflective, but it still looked pretty glaring to me.  I don't like very much glare on my monitors, and I was wondering how it is for you.  Any issues when playing in a well-lit room?  Aside from this issue I have, it looks like a fabulous monitor."
19 holes.
"Most of these are franchise chains, and the quality is only as good as the franchisee.

While I usually stay at Hampton Inn on road trips, I've been to a number of the others as well.  I like Hilton's program that 5th night a stay is free.

I've never had a bad experience at a Comfort Inn or a La Quinta.

My most recent stay was at a Hilton Garden Inn, and it was fine.  The room was no smaller than most."
"Neither is AC: Odyssey, but that was the game OP was referencing so that is why so many recommendations are lax on the ""RPG"" requirement."
Which one do you write for?
"My boyfriend (and baby daddy) said he wants to go fishing. He works a lot and just wants to get up early, drink some beer, and enjoy his day. I'm going to throw some sex and bacon at him before he goes though."
John C. Reilly is exactly as affable and pleasant as you assume he is.
"Unfortunately while the twist is fairly interesting, this is around when M.Knight started focusing on that more than the actual film. The rest of the movie is really forgettable and even annoying in how forcefully we are shown that this town is ""totally actually in colonial times guys."""
"agreed. The debt is killer, but i had no other choice in the matter. I was out on my own and had to work full time to pay my bills while going to school."
