68247,"-**Eyes of the Overworld** by Jack Vance


-**The Wolves of Memory** by George Alec Effinger


-**Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang** by Kate Wilhelm


-**Behold the Man** by Michael Moorcock


-**The Forever War** by Joe Haldeman



These are in no order, but I highly recommend them all. The Vance one is a book from the *Dying Earth* saga that is my favorite series ever. The Wolves of Memory is like a game of Paranoia RPG that got too serious, super dark book that blew me away and needs to be read by more. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a unique take on both cloning and the post-apocalypse genre, another that doesn't get enough love. Behold the Man is the king of time travel books in my mind, with the bonus of addressing religion.",best science fiction novel

63829,"I would suggest Mastery by George Leonard (not to be confused with a book of the same title by Robert Greene). It's not specifically about changing the types of habits you list, but for this:

>and do more of the things I say I want to do

It could help you stay with a goal or keep on a path that you want to stick with. It's by an aikido master, and espouses a worldview of perseverance, roughly by being more process-oriented and less goal-oriented. It has helped me immensely, and it's a pretty short and easy read so even if it's not what you're looking for, you won't lose too much time. Good luck!
