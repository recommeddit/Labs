16845,best pet for toddlers,"Oh they have tiny little sharp teeth lol. Maybe males just have a stronger bite, I don't think any females I've had have drawn blood. I bred them for a little while, then downsized to 1 leopard gecko and now 2 cresties."

12487,best gifts for mom,"The biggest hits so far have been a felted tote bag that I made, and...a Thermos travel mug.  It turned out to be the perfect travel mug for her needs and preferences.  She loves that thing."
37101,best amusement park,It's more of a matter of this still being an imperfect science. It'll improve each year as more people vote on it.
55236,best places to hike in the east coast,"As a resident of NC, I highly recommend basically anywhere in [Pisgah National Forest] (http://www.hikewnc.info/trailheads/pisgah-national-forest/). First hike I ever did in the area was [Catawba Falls] (http://www.hikewnc.info/trailheads/pisgah-national-forest/grandfather-ranger-district/catawba-falls/) and I still highly recommend it as a day hike. But if you want to get as far away from civilization as possible, you can't beat [Linville Gorge] (http://www.ncnatural.com/Resources/Adventure/Gorge/Linville-Gorge.html)."
43812,best items under $100,Leatherman or Gerber multi tool.
50508,best rap album,"Some of the production on there is a bit of a mess though. Tracks like The Finest or Red and Gold. 

The best tracks (Deadbent, Doomsday, Rhymes Like Dimes) are probably my favourite DOOM tracks of all time but there were some weird production decisions in there as well.

I'd agree that Madvillainy is his best produced project."

68247,best science fiction novel,"-**Eyes of the Overworld** by Jack Vance


-**The Wolves of Memory** by George Alec Effinger


-**Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang** by Kate Wilhelm


-**Behold the Man** by Michael Moorcock


-**The Forever War** by Joe Haldeman



These are in no order, but I highly recommend them all. The Vance one is a book from the *Dying Earth* saga that is my favorite series ever. The Wolves of Memory is like a game of Paranoia RPG that got too serious, super dark book that blew me away and needs to be read by more. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a unique take on both cloning and the post-apocalypse genre, another that doesn't get enough love. Behold the Man is the king of time travel books in my mind, with the bonus of addressing religion."

63829,best books for building better habits reddit,"I would suggest Mastery by George Leonard (not to be confused with a book of the same title by Robert Greene). It's not specifically about changing the types of habits you list, but for this:

>and do more of the things I say I want to do

It could help you stay with a goal or keep on a path that you want to stick with. It's by an aikido master, and espouses a worldview of perseverance, roughly by being more process-oriented and less goal-oriented. It has helped me immensely, and it's a pretty short and easy read so even if it's not what you're looking for, you won't lose too much time. Good luck!
