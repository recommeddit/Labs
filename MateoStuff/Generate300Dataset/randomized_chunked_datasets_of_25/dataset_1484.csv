Set the button after meals and it saved so much time. Especially during the food throwing phase. Get the scooba for mopping the floors. Best combo ever."

33902,best Pokemon game,"I agree, Heartgold is my favourite pokemon game of all time, everything about it is excellent: the story, the battles, and the music. I really like the style of graphics and gameplay from everything from generations 1-5, and then generation 6 onward just isn't the right style."

14712,best romantic novel,"Her period romances are great, but her mysteries are not nearly as good. Everything I dislike about Agatha Christie's books, and none of the redeeming features."
45145,best items under $100,Adderal is life. Makes thinking like the normal people possible.
50714,best rap album,"My favorite album so far this year is Pray for Haiti. First Mach-Hommy album I’ve listened to and I loved it. I’m a big fan of Westside Gunn and Griselda in general so I knew I was going to like it at least somewhat going into it, but it still ended up blowing me away. West just has such a great ear for beats and knows how to curate that type of stuff so well. 

I also really enjoyed La Maquina from Conway. Great work from top to bottom. 200 Pies, Sister Abigail, Scatter Brain, Brusier Body and S.E. Gang were standouts to me. 

Other favorites of mine so far this year are The Plugs I Met 2, If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed, The Off Season, Tha Wolf on Wall St and To Kill a Sunrise.

Been enjoying the new Peter Rosenberg, Lloyd Banks and Smoke DZA lately. Excited to see what the rest of the year brings."

36725,best alcoholic drink,"Tequila (preferably Don Julio) with soda and a splash of grapefruit!

Tequila is my favorite but I hate margs because the sugar overload is always too much for me, so this drink is a dream concoction for me. Also, if I want something a little sweeter, I do pineapple instead of grapefruit."
