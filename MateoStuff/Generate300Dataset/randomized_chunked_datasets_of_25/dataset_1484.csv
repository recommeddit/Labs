50714,"My favorite album so far this year is Pray for Haiti. First Mach-Hommy album I’ve listened to and I loved it. I’m a big fan of Westside Gunn and Griselda in general so I knew I was going to like it at least somewhat going into it, but it still ended up blowing me away. West just has such a great ear for beats and knows how to curate that type of stuff so well. 

I also really enjoyed La Maquina from Conway. Great work from top to bottom. 200 Pies, Sister Abigail, Scatter Brain, Brusier Body and S.E. Gang were standouts to me. 

Other favorites of mine so far this year are The Plugs I Met 2, If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed, The Off Season, Tha Wolf on Wall St and To Kill a Sunrise.

Been enjoying the new Peter Rosenberg, Lloyd Banks and Smoke DZA lately. Excited to see what the rest of the year brings.",best rap album
