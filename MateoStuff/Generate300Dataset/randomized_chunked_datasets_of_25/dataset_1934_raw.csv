"> Notepad++ (Windows only) - Another good editor, familiar keybindings, good multiline editing, good search features. I use this one at work a lot too. It works in Wine on Linux too.

There's also [NotepadQQ](https://notepadqq.com/s/), which is enough like Notepad++ that it's almost a direct port."
Came here to say this as well - Grace Draven is a phenomenal writer!
"I know that a pretty huge amount of german streamers use this. I don't exactly know which revision or version they are using. I never heard about that problem, maybe you investigate this before buying anything."
These black rubber Ray Bans https://specsandmore.com/rb4222-rayban-round-622 have been my every day sunglasses for a couple of years now. So comfy. Less slippery than plastic and I love that their nose support is attached so it doesnt collect foundation or get stuck in my hair.
"Wow, what a spread for Spirit Island:

Off many lists entirely, but top ten in two & #1 overall for one of them.

Here's a suggestion that might not be possible to implement this year but is worth thinking about for next year: be able to filter out games that made *someone's* \#1 or top 5 or top 10 or whatever. I think a flaw to the list (not necessarily a flaw on your end, simply a flaw of aggregate lists) is that some games just aren't widely reviewed. So the top games are going to be widely reviewed games that are well-regarded. That's not a bad thing at all, but I love SI & it made me think that I'd value games that are highly rated even if not widely reviewed.

Thanks for putting this together & sharing it!"

"Whether you’re a civilian who was killed by a drone strike because the US wants the oil under you or you die from your water supply being poisoned from fracking, you’re just as dead. The point was not that the US military is more ethical, or that the things they do are not wrong or imperialist, but that it’s just another part of the capitalist system, and the biggest difference is that the way the military kills you is more a direct cause of death than a side effect of their main goal (which I mean it still is, since they exist to protect the interests of American capital above all else)"
I realised I was in an abusive relationship because of that book.  The fake diary that she writes - all of her lies where she makes her husband out to be a shit - I related to it way too much.
Haha so true. I’ve been to castles and coasters and when I saw it I thought to myself “that’s sad...”

"In addition to Grammarly, or maybe some other AI checker, I recommend:

* [Ann Raimes' Keys for Writers](https://www.cengage.com/c/keys-for-writers-8e-raimes/9781305956759/), a grammar/usage guidebook with a good section on what to look out for coming from different language backgrounds, I think including Korean.

* Longman's dictionary, https://www.ldoceonline.com/, which has helpful features like specifying countable vs. uncountable including breaking that down by meaning (some words mean different things in the countable vs. uncountable forms)."
"There is a variety of good and not so good feedback.  In general the consensus is that Brita filters do remove some things, but not ALL the things.

Brita filters tend to be filters based on the use of activated carbon(AC), while I don't know specifically what type of AC, I do know that AC has been known to be tailored to target specific contaminants to some extent. (I actually took a graduate course titled Activated Carbon)

So there are two big principles associated with filters and specifically Brita filters. 1) is actual filtration.  You mention it by talking about larger particles.  This is often referred to as turbidity, and it is the things that aren't dissolved in water.  Things like microorganisms, insoluble minerals, etc. The removal of these things is dependent on their size and the media size.
2) is the ability of AC to adsorb (adhere to the surface of) charged particles. This is how you get the removal of ions and organic contaminants.  The AC is an extremely porous media (my professor said that a particle has the surface area of a football field - this is conjecture just to give you an idea of extent of surface area) and throughout the surface there are different functional groups that help facilitate binding.  

Someone elsewhere said that britas are good for ions but not organics, this is not necessarily true. Some organics, sure. AC is often used in water treatment plants to reduce their organic load prior to disinfection.  It really depends on the organics in the water at the time and the carbon its self. 

I have seen some work in developing communities where they use a combination of AC with slow sand filters, to treat drinking water.  The sand filters are better at removing microorganisms, which are often too small for AC media to remove, and the AC removes other contaminants.

Ultimately, I would say that I wouldn't necessarily trust a brita alone if you don't know the drinking water quality.  A virus is pretty small and can get through pretty easily. Someone mentioned using brita and boiling, this could give you a decent water (depending on source.) As a suggestion though (my hurricane survival strategy) is Brita + couple drops of bleach.  The inactivation of microbes from the bleach is usually pretty good, and you don't have to boil the water.


Ultimately, I don't have a real answer to your question.  The brita can potentially make your water safer to drink and remove nasty things like Mercury or toxic organic compounds, but I can't issue a blanket statement saying that Brita just makes your water safe.  It is great for polishing already treated water, and really good at removing chlorine taste (AC sucks up chlorine like it is its job)."

"Notepad++ looks like a very nice editor for the (lack of any) price. I have to say, I probably wouldn't use Ultra-Edit if I had to pay full price for it, but there are plenty of discounts if you know where to look. I've also been using Ultra-Edit for years and years, since long before Notepad++ came out (late 2003, if Wikipedia hasn't lied to me again), so some of my recommendation is probably just inertia.

Ultra-Edit is a full hex editor, not just text editor. For me, this is an extremely important feature; for you, perhaps not. This is probably the most significant difference between the two.

Notepad++ appears to support only standard Unix/POSIX regular expressions, a subset of the more powerful and more recent Perl regular expression standard. I use a few Perl/PCRE features fairly often, so this is something I notice when I'm stuck with a Unix RE engine.

Notepad++'s shell extension is probably just as capable as Ultra-Edit's, since I don't imagine it's that hard to write a shell extension. Both are certainly preferable to your file type trick; that only works for certain file types, while a shell extension makes right-click editing of *any* file possible. Not so useful for a text editor, I agree, but very nice for a *hex* editor, since it can chew on binary files as well as text.

So my conclusion is that Notepad++ is probably a fine editor, but Ultra-Edit has a few features that Notepad++ lacks, features which I would miss. You may not, in which case the free alternative is clearly superior."
