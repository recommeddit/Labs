Many don't even have the required level of alcohol the FDA requires(of course because they have no jurisdiction here) and the FDA has pretty low standards on the global scale to be honest. I try to buy the german stuff only whenever I can, but tbh I'm just 100% quarantined being just an student at the moment.",best hand santizer brand

4322,"Another vote for UltraEdit here. It's tremendously powerful and always gets the job done for me, though I don't use many of its more advanced features. I also don't think it has been maintained particularly well; it's a little rough around the edges, with more modern features like text antialiasing feeling poorly bolted-on. And it has suffered tremendously from feature creep (but I suppose the marketing department has to get their due).

Ultra-Edit really has two killer features for me:

1. Perl regular expression support! I could not use an editor without this. Though Ultra-Edit's implementation seems to choke on a few of the edge cases and more obscure Perl-introduced features (even though they've been standardized for years now...)

2. Shell extension: I can right-click any file and open it in Ultra-Edit with just one more click. This is absolutely awesome once you have it, and something I always miss on my Linux desktop.",best text editor

38664,"""The Week"" is a very good news-magazine with local, European, American, and global sections. It provides a cross-spectrum analysis of what the papers are saying, how it effects the common fowk, and what may happen in the future. It covers all the major stories, and has a detailed financial section. I recommend it to everyone.

Sony XM4 - for best noise cancelling but boomy bassy sound

Sennheiser momentum - for fun sound but ok anc

b&w px7 - for best all-round, great sound and good anc. although sound quality dips a lot with anc on",best headphones
