64094,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"libgen is oriented towards textbooks, MAM towards the rest. You can't really compare the 2

> Private trackers are terrible especially since Bib has stopped taking invites

That's not true. Even if it was, MAM would be enough for you. Any book you can't find on MAM, just make a request. If the book exists on BIB, the request will be filled."
61812,Best RPG game on PS4,">you can't really change his combat style

Did you even play the game? You can get through the entire thing almost never swinging your sword. If you think that there's only one play style for Gerald, thats on you. Don't unfairly label the game because of where you chose to put your points."
66438,best soccer team in the world,"Norway did get a new trainer, Ståle Solbakken, who coached FC Copenhagen for better part of a decade. And we got to see Haaland and Ødegaard really click at the end of Nations League. Netherlands is a good team though.

Also Haaland barely played in the EURO qualification campaign and we still drew Sweden twice and Spain once without him, while being the only team with an honourable result away in Spain (2-1)"

9101,best toothpaste,It doesn't have to be fluoride based though? i'm just asking because I use a baking soda based toothpaste and my teeth have improved and plaque has been reduced.
37541,best amusement park,"Hmmm, but even the old Steel Phantom was vastly different from Steel Curtain today; I wouldn’t call them “basically the same.”

Also SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn offer completely different ride experiences. Aside from being hypers, they have nothing else in common. They were even manufactured by three different companies."

44792,best items under $100,"I have one of these, best winter coat I've ever had.  I thought it might compare to CG, but wasn't sure.  I bought mine for $150 the last winter Sears was open, mine is a bit longer."

37025,best roller coaster at six flags,"Cedar Fair is better then Six Flags. Kings island has a bit of theme, and there are some coasters filled with trees (Beast and diamondback). Both of the Busch Gardens are the best theme parks in the US. Of course, Disney and Universal are amazing, too."
42020,movies like Inception,"It's an anime film, but you should absolutely check out Paprika if you haven't seen it. It is everything you stated and was a big influence on Inception."
47867,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I have ti calculator but mostly used to check graphs. In multivariable lot of graph are 3d and the only way to get them nicely is using math programs to graph for you, otherwise you draw them as level sets, compressed onto two dimension.

But if you can, getting that calculator is always nice because for modeling more complex graph later on then it is always nice to have extra tool. Just nowadays so many graphing technologies online. But I have color Ti so it is very nice sometimes haha."
