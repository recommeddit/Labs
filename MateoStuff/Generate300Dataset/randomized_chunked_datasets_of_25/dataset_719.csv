55928,"Really liked Solo but couldn't ever buy Alden as being the same guy we see in A New Hope. It all comes down to the voice for me; Alden's is too high or nasally or something. Not that I wanted him to do a Harrison impression but Alden's voice was just too different. Also, he's so close in age to Harrison in A New Hope that it's hard to put it down to age difference.

Taken on its own merits though it's a really solid, fun movie.",best action and adventure movie
37238,"There is a certain point that you can build a park to and then it makes more sense to stop.  One of the biggest lessons in this is Six Flags Worlds of Adventure in which Cedar Fair realized just how hard it is to repair a park that has been destroyed by growth.  Dorney has a charm that the big parks don't have and it's a different experience than the likes of KI and CP.  When I go to Dorney I'm really going for something different than the work that's involved in making sure you get to every ride you want to and if you start adding stuff you actually lessen the draw that Dorney has for me.  Even MiA is in this same classification.  Both of these parks also thrive on the combo of dry/water parks in the same day and, even though I'm not really ac water park guy, these are the parks that I wouldn't mind stopping at the water park because I don't feel like I'm ruining the dry park experience.

Bottom line is this: These small parks aren't aimed at the people that just want to spend the entire day going from ride to ride non-stop.  If you start trying to capture that audience you alienate an entire base of their visitors and net a gain of basically nothing.",best amusement park

Of course the older software is better when paired with other older software.

I like cydia as much as the next guy but to say it’s generally better than everything else just because it works fine on older software is a very narrow minded view.",best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit

If your budget is up to $250 that ASUS monitor supports up to 144Hz so if you are playing more competitive/eSports type games they will be much smoother if your GPU is capable.

Is similar to the first option, but offer FreeSync, if you are using an AMD video card. Also just a little be more expensive and may be out of your budget.

https://smile.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX2757-MHD-DisplayPort-FreeSync-Technology/dp/B01A0ZRRCI?ie=UTF8&tag=pcpapi-20

Two options from ViewSonic 24"" for $160 and 27"" for $220. Both are 1080p so be aware that the larger screen isn't higher resolution. This doesn't make a huge difference in gaming, IMO, but windows and text in a browser might seem larger than typical if used to a 24"" 1080p monitor.

Both support FreeSync and go up to 75Hz. Obviously not as high as 120 or 144, but its still a noticeably and welcome improvement to 60Hz.

https://smile.amazon.com/AOC-G2460PF-24-Inch-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B01BV1XBEI?ie=UTF8&tag=pcpapi-20

Final option here, AOC 24"" 1080p with FreeSync and refresh rates up to 144Hz. If refresh rate is a high priority this is the most affordable option to get the highest refresh rates available today. It also comes with a pretty robust stand that allows it to be raise quite high, and rotated vertically. Seems to hit all the features for a great price and reviews seem to be quite favorable.",best desktop monitor
