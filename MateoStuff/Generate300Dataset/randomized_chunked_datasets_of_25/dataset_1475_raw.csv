"Aside from the ones already mentioned, any host with mysql and php supports WP. I work in the hosting industry, and as such I will sound biased - but I can say with honesty that there is no such things as the ‘best’ WordPress web host. The absolute best case scenario (if you’re aiming for that) is to run your own server. Why? Because in this instance you’re controlling everything. 

Another issue I wanted to mention - be wary of review sites because most of them will be paid reviews. At some time or another, you will read a glowing review of web host A and then a really bad review of the same web host. Who do you believe? 

When looking for a host, then, I suggest you look for one that meets specific criteria. For example, longevity. If a host has been around for 5 years and is doing well, that’s a really good sign. Customer support is the bedrock of a good host, too, as has some form of security addition, be it a web app firewall. Make sure the host lets you create your own backup too, as this is really important for site security. Hosts perform backups themselves but you don’t get to retain the data. Moreover, how often do they perform the backup? Key question."

"The periodontist that I saw while stationed in the Pentagon told me that of the two parts of dental hygiene, flossing is actually more important than brushing."
"I have an extremely outdated MacBook pro and am not trying to spend that amount again.

"Actually I just put Metropole there because it has such a nice flow and is the latest one which I am really enyoing at the moment :)
I love all of their albums though. 15 years of great music!"
"I like it, but would cut kanye and danny brown. Those 2 are way too overrated by their fans, as much as I do love some Danny."
"Definitely. When I feel myself coming down with something, I'll take melatonin around 8pm every single night to ensure I'm in bed by 9 and get a full night's sleep. 

I'm always back to 100% within a week.

"Same here. My wife used to be that way, until I kept reminding her how lucky she is to have such great teeth. She's a lot better with it now, but it really irked me."
The Dispossessed is GREAT. Ursula is required reading.

"I like Dan Trachtenberg, but I'm still going to remain *cautiously* optimistic. Trachtenberg has shown a aptitude for making suspenseful, claustrophobic films with twisted narratives. Setpiece-based adventure is a whole other genre, and until he pulls it off, I'm hesitating to assume he can.

&#x200B;

That being said, it's great that he's genuinely invested in the project and not just trying to make a buck."
