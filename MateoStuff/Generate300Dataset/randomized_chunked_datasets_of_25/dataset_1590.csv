16891,best iOS game,You’ll probably like Jydge too. Similar universe. Jydge is a prequel to Neon Chrome and has a lot of interesting aspects as you’ll develop your character and face numerous challenges.
41780,movies like Inception,"[Well, I think the last 10 seconds is really compelling evidence that he knows he's a patient, but at the same time, it doesn't make sense that they would willingly allow a mental patient to cause havoc on the facility, including blowing up the doctor's car.  Seems like if that was the case, they should have drugged him up and lobotomized him anyway.](/spoiler)

[Also, the last 10 seconds of the movie isn't him deciding to get the lobotomy.  It's actually a fade to black of the light tower where the proposed lobotomies take place.](/spoiler)

I think I REALLY like this movie because the ending is STILL left ambiguous with very compelling arguments on both sides.  In the end, it doesn't take away from the overall movie either."

40763,best instrument to play,"Well, if you are good at playing the instrument they all become fun in their own way. It's really satisfying to listen to yourself play and think "" Damn, I'm good."" It just makes you really happy. For me, Oboe is a fun instrument to play."
62414,Best RPG game on PS4,Witcher 3 is still the one for me. I just started Horizon Zero Dawn and as much as I like it I wish the world had more to discover for myself like the Witcher does.
68743,best science fiction novel,"Sounds like we had similar experiences.  I read Ender's after hearing about his position on evolution.  I try to approach every book with an open mind, and not confuse the author with whatever he/she has written, but even so it was hard to get past his comments on scientific topics and see the book for what it really was.  I think I mostly succeeded, but just the same Ender's isn't very good."
11173,best backpack for college,"They are out of production but can be found in the wild.  I have an Abercrombie and Fitch A-10 backpack, [like this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Abercrombie-Fitch-A10-Backpack-/290600774798), that I use daily and have had for over 8 years.  It is completely durable and than a little fray on one of the cords, it's perfectly fine."

This isn't true. I have many Audible books from an account I cancelled years ago that still play just fine.  As long as you keep your computer authorized, they'll still play, and transfer to my iPod without problems."

11320,best gifts for dad,"The first Father's Day after I left my ex, she kept my son because it was the weekend of her birthday. She felt it was more appropriate to take a 3 year old to party in Miami, than for him to see his dad on Father's Day. I sat in church, crying as I listened to all the other children sing about how much they loved their daddies. So yeah, I feel you. Just remember you don't need a holiday to know how much your kids love you. Still, I hope you get to see them. Hug the shit out of them if you do."

3939,best online college,"Former recruiter here. While selecting resumes, the employment agency I worked for ALWAYS preferred someone who got a degree from a ""physical"" college over someone who got an online degree (like Phoenix University). I've heard it been referred to as a ""Mickey Mouse College"". But, an online degree is better than no degree, so you're still winning."

68726,best science fiction novel,"William Gibson's 21st century work is largely conceptually toned down from his earlier, better known cyberpunk novels (Neuromancer et al) but his recent book The Peripheral is science fiction of the rarest sort: a  grounded, thoughtful time travel story that features no less than two intriguing and eerily plausible apocalyptic futures (suck on that, Hunger Games).

Gibsons world building is spare and organic: he lets dialogue and action fill in the gaps rather than relying on narrative infodumps, and the story goes from bizarre and incomprehensible in the opening pages to an interdimensional epic that reimagines contemporary proxy warfare fought by superpowers as a chess game played by futuristic oligarchs.  

Apparently Amazon is adapting The Peripheral into a series, so read it now and be that irritating dude who won't shut up about how much better the book was.  

Also read Gibsons other recent stuff.  Not sci fi per se, but tight, well-imagined light futurism (I guess) - I think he captures something of post-9/11 America that no other writer (ime) quite manages.  

Another rec: China Mieville is (rightly) better known for his fantasy work, but I enjoyed the hell out of The City and The City and feel like it qualifies as science fiction - no aliens or cloning, but Mieville takes a contemporary issue and extrapolates it out in an interesting, high concept direction.  Worth checking out."
