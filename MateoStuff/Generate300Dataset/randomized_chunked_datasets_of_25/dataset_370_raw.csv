I just know Arrowhead tastes like ass.
A full day of uninterrupted me time followed by dinner with my BFFs (you're not invited)
"Yea they never really look now, most of them know me....damn new old house lol.  I used to not use for cheaper stuff but really saving 1-5 bucks 2-3 times a week starts to add up!"
The 50s where they only lost 1 game which was unfortunately the World Cup Final
"Right now I’m just testing them all out to see which one I like the best. The way I see them right now is:

-Cydia is of course Cydia. 

-Zebra acts like a proper successor to Cydia. 

-Sileo tries to be a spin-off of Cydia with inspiration from the App Store. 

-Installer 5 is its own thing with inspiration from the App Store."
What about NIKE Kukinis? Why were they discontinued?
"""We lost your bag."""
You are absolutely right!
"Yes, Le Male is a compliment puller for sure."
Surprised no ones mentioned Kristen Ashley yet. Her Rock Chick series is a great place to start but the rest of her books are excellent as well! I’ve reread them over and over!

"Hi I’m looking for a laptop for dual use of light gaming/college schoolwork. I’m looking for a balance of everything. Medium size, medium weight, decent battery life with as much performance as I can get for my money. I don’t care about a 2 in 1, but an ssd would be nice. The games I play are primarily league of legends and Skyrim if that helps. My price range is around $800, but that can go up or down a few hundred in order to get what I’m looking for. Thank you!!"
"Definitely not worth it, can get fake polarized wayfarers for $30 on aliexpress which are identical in every way."
Would be great if you could edit with the PSA about never mixing acetamenaphin and alcohol. That stuff will destroy your liver.
Thank you! To me IM3 is by far the worst.
Amazon Basic Nylon Cable for me. I've had like 5 or 6 of them for years now and no issues.

Marty’s pizza on De La Vina is my favorite
Fifa takes the game of twenty plus one very seriously.
Nigella Lawson once quoted some Italian bloke as saying your pasta water should be salty as the Mediterranean. I've never looked back.
Apparently my auto correct sort of outed my love of flogging my gums.
