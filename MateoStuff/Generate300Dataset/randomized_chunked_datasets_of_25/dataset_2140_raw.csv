"He writes really GOOD action, too. The robotic assault on the construction facility in Pandora's Star (trying to keep it vague to avoid spoilers) is on the scale of what you'd find at the end of most blockbusters, and it's just one chapter, partway through the book. It's awesome."
"Does anyone have any good info on novamin (calcium sodium phosphosilicate)? I know it's got something to do with re-building enamel.

Also where might one get toothpaste containing it? best I could find in the store was burt's bees toothpaste, but novamin is only one of the inactive ingredients..."
"Absolute rubbish.  I picked up my first guitar at 26 and now I'm 37.  I can freaking shred some serious blues, write slow lovey dovey songs that get girls panties wet and even venture into some metal (but I leave when the screaming starts)."
">Well, I did not see that coming.

But hopefully, /u/bigcalal did."
Just got it for the same reasons as OP. Im looking forward to it.
Thanks I might consider that now
"You scared me for a minute there, my friend."
Bo Knows! Super Iconic. One of the first athletes I can remember getting his own ad campaign
Agreed! Such a mindf*ck of a movie - it is available on amazon prime now!
Forensic files!
"Binford.

but in all seriousness, I try to follow pricing and focus on brand of what I'm getting > brand of store."
Most of them are.
"You know, I don't really know! I'mma say Holland, mostly because [his line delivery when Peter asks Liz to the dance](#spoiler). It is literally the cutest thing in the world."
Only chumps that's who!
Just came here to say that Tom Holland Spider-Man cAnt fight for shit   .  Then again john watts besides that mysterio scene hasnâ€™t really created any memorable sequences
Subscribed! Looking forward to how it will pan out.
"Probably the best one I've ever given her will be this year actually.  It's a birthday/christmas gift.  She's coming down this weekend to spend thanksgiving with us (from NY, I live in the south), and her birthday is during the time she's down here..  I got my wife to teach me to crotchet, and watched videos to learn as well.  So, I crotchet'd her a prayer shawl over the last few weeks.  I expect a lot of tears lol, can't wait."

My favorite unusual combination is a recipe from [Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home](http://www.amazon.com/Jenis-Splendid-Ice-Creams-Home/dp/1579654363/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1398978523&sr=8-8&keywords=ice+cream+recipes): Sweet Corn with Black Raspberries. Sweet and tart and delicious!
Did you even attempt to use the search function?
"For the last several years, my daughter and I developed sort of a tradition. We'd wake up, she'd make breakfast, then we'd drive to Encinitas, picking up strawberries along the way to Quail Botanical Gardens, where we'd spend a few hours just wandering around and enjoying the chocolate (they do a small chocolate festival there on Mother's Day), and the plants, and the various gardens. Then we would head home and have dinner and watch a movie. Simple, but so lovely. Unfortunately, my transmission went out on my car so we'll have to forgo that tradition this year, but she's already planning her alternative. 

Other than that, what I want more than anything is for my daughter and I to be able to go out to Minnesota to see *my* mom, whom we both miss a great deal!

Just wanted to add: I understand all the moms in this thread wanting a ""day off"" from the rigors of small children. Raising kids is exhausting. I personally don't think I would enjoy that myself, though. I enjoyed a day of no housework, sure, but spending the day with my kids was always the very best part of Mother's Day for me."
"Considering I am from a state which became part of the US because of this war, quite a bit, but still probably not as much as what you would expect. Our entire teaching of the war was framed from the perspective of Westward Expansion and Manifest Destiny, as well as the [California Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Republic)."
"Rich Gannon was a very, very good QB. Better than a Daunte Culpepper and comparable to a Carson Palmer."
Best buy is an American store that I don't have access to
Gettysburg is a must.
