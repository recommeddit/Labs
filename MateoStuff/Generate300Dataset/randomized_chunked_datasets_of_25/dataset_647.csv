39619,best podcast for biologists,"You're not going to find many strictly general biology podcasts, but there are plenty of great general science podcasts. Examples: Nature podcast, Guardian science podcast, Science Friday, etc. Just go to iTunes and search the science and medicine podcast page for interesting stuff. Sounds like you are pretty early in your science career so keep your mind open. You'll get the specific biology knowledge from your classes when it comes, but if you are super eager to get a jumpstart on the topics you mentioned above, you might want to check out some of these [open Yale lectures](http://oyc.yale.edu/). They have some specific advanced biology courses that might interest you."
23830,best car racing video game,"Project Cars, DiRT 3, NFS:MW!"
59369,best perfume,"It's called Fantasy and I am 100% sure it's like 40 years old and you can barely read the label anymore. I have been asked ""can I sniff you"" and then been told, ""smells like unicorn to me"". However, I have also been told that I smell like rancid waffles which I didn't even know was a thing. So, in conclusion, it's a 50/50 success rate."
39615,best podcast for biologists,"Bioscience is only once a month, but it's good."
47580,best state to visit in the United States,"NC. We're not doing so fantastic with government lately, but we have some awesome stuff. Naturewise, coast to coast it's beautiful. The Cherokee reservation (skip the casino and the knick-knack shops around it, go to the Okanaluftee village or Bearmeat's indian den for authentic crafts and accurate history) The Blue Ridge Parkway, The Biltmore house and gardens(fun fact, Hitler wanted to live there if he had managed to take over the US), Great Smokey Mountains National park, bits of Blackbeard's ship at Beaufort, Cape Hatteras light house, a good swath of the Appalachian trail, I could go on and on, but yeah, we have a lot of nature and a lot of history. [good article with some other highlights here](http://www.onlyinyourstate.com/north-carolina/amazing-sights-in-nc/)"
59135,best perfume,"Ugh, I used to get TONS of compliments when I would wear old formula of Miss Dior Cherie. They changed the formula and it smells ordinary and lame now. So I save my last bottle for every now and then so I can savor it.

But I found an acceptable replacement, which I also get compliments on (though not as many) - Coco Mademoiselle. It's not too heavy, not too sweet. It's a perfect every day perfume."
16408,best sunglasses for fashion,"1. Out East Eyewear 
2. Ray Ban 
3. QUAY for cheap pairs 

I prefer to support independent owned brands. So I don‚Äôt actually buy Ray Ban anymore üòé"

72435,best keyboard switches,"Everyone has given you options from Mx to Topre. Now I don't want to throw too much into this pot of stew but you may want to consider a IBM Model M/F with buckling springs/Capacitive buckling springs. Can be bought very cheaply(only second hand unless you want a unicomp model) and are widely loved for their typing experience. That said if you plan to game on them they do only have 2KRO so you won't be able to ""type with your face"" so to speak."
32685,best vacation resort,"Fort Lauderdale maybe.  Warm in March, family friendly, great food, and worthwhile day trips in the area, like Miami or the Everglades."
