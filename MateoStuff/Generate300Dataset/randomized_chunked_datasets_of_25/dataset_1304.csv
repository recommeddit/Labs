62107,Saw that you haven't played The Witcher 3. Definitely going to be your best bet for a good RPG. Although there's plenty of others out there. AC: Odyssey is enjoyable. Story is a bit lackluster but the gameplay was right there.,Best RPG game on PS4
54407,Artisan is just higher quality. You won't find another pad with lower stitching and the rubber base sucks itself to your desk. But these are comfort things. If you're not into spending extra for a premium experience then you shouldn't get an Artisan.,best artisan mousepad alternatives

3955,"I have an elementary education degree from Phoenix. I got a long term subbing job before I even graduated and am now teaching full time (got this job five months after I graduated, once hiring for this school year began). 

That being said, I did three years of my schooling at a private Christian university in my home state. I went to UoP because I was freshly married to a man in the military and we had to move and I had no idea "" real schools"" had online programs. I hated UoP and I worried I wouldn't get a job. Luckily people can tell I'm not a dipshit. Networking is also important.",best online college
