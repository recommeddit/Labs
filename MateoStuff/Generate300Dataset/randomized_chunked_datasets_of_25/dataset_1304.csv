62107,Best RPG game on PS4,Saw that you haven't played The Witcher 3. Definitely going to be your best bet for a good RPG. Although there's plenty of others out there. AC: Odyssey is enjoyable. Story is a bit lackluster but the gameplay was right there.
54407,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Artisan is just higher quality. You won't find another pad with lower stitching and the rubber base sucks itself to your desk. But these are comfort things. If you're not into spending extra for a premium experience then you shouldn't get an Artisan.
14048,best place to get free books,I was afraid of that...
58036,best cologne,My brain will not read that word as anything other than lactose.
16901,best iOS game,"Oceanhorn 2, Asphalt 9, TheoTown, GTA:SA, Game Dev Story"
73366,best battery bank,This should be the top comment. I regret my 20k
8483,best toothpaste,"Recommended by 100% of dentists!*

*of 1 dentists"
3955,best online college,"I have an elementary education degree from Phoenix. I got a long term subbing job before I even graduated and am now teaching full time (got this job five months after I graduated, once hiring for this school year began). 

That being said, I did three years of my schooling at a private Christian university in my home state. I went to UoP because I was freshly married to a man in the military and we had to move and I had no idea "" real schools"" had online programs. I hated UoP and I worried I wouldn't get a job. Luckily people can tell I'm not a dipshit. Networking is also important."
29000,best breakfast foods,"So hearty is a good thing. Try this out.

1 onion of choice
1 can of hominy
1 package of bacon or a log of sausage

Brown meat, then throw in coarsely chopped onion. Salt and pepper to taste. Drain hominy, then add to Tue mix. Let hominy brown slightly. Spend the next couple hours completely stuffed. :)"
31101,best country to live in,What sort of tech/social science? I would suggest New Zealand but the type of job could be limiting...
27428,best bollywood actor,"1. Ajay

5. SRK

6. Salman"
14699,best romantic novel,"I never would have considered Rebecca a romance when I read it, though it's been some time. The semantics of it's classification aside, I agree that it's a great mystery and psychological thriller."
61824,Best RPG game on PS4,To be fair if you got to Novigrad in TW3 you probably did all the best quests already. There's still some great content after that (I enjoyed a lot of Skellige) but nothing (until maybe the DLC) really livesup to those first few quest lines in the South.
10811,best suitcase lock,"Oh no, they stole his laser!"
44716,best items under $100,Edited to add
69205,best major to study in college,"Majored in Accounting, worked a bit, and then went and got a masters in a specific field of I.E. (Supply Chain Engineering). 

Accounting/Finance + Supply Chain skills landed me a $180k job at 30. 

No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune)."
15569,best tree for the garden,"No clue, do you have a general area in mind?  You might check out permaculture."
40801,best instrument to play,"In our case I'd go with the piano, but I suggest getting a teacher (this also goes for most other instruments) you dont have to go every week for x years but it's important to get the basics right (to prevent injury and getting better). With piano you can play practically everything (especially if later on you invest in a Synthesizer) and it's the easiest instrument to learn musictheory."
26506,best politician,A good set of teeth for constant smiling and the ability to lie relentlessly without feeling remorse. Also you need to deliver speeches in a way that it seems you might be taking both sides of a debate without ever deliberately stating what you think. Ride that fence.
46802,best hand santizer brand,"I've seen hand sanitizers claiming they can kill that particular virus.
Marketing, marketing."
29338,best game console,"XB1 feels like ""PC Lite.""

PS4 or Switch for ""the console experience.""

Switch is more kiddie but some people like that.

PS4 is more serious/adult ""console experience.""

So my vote is PS4."
42727,best detective show,You mean Ófærð?
18979,best YouTube video,Yes! I love his videos they are really funny and interesting.
38320,best newspapers to read,"The Guardian if you avoid the opinion section like the plague. The UK politics live-blogs are great.

Second the Hindu for India.

The Atlantic, while not a newspaper, has pretty great international analysis."
46208,best trick or treating candy,or apples.
