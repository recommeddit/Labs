51337,"As far as I know all clear (soft) TPU yellows.  The hybrid with a (hard) polycarbonate back mitigate this because the PC doesn’t yellow while the TPU edges will yellow over time.  My solution is to get a case that’s no more than about $12 and just replace it every 6 months or so.

This is one reason Apple’s 12 Pro clear case is such a disaster.  They used materials that apparently don’t yellow but the case is brittle and cracks, it’s uncomfortable, and the buttons are damn near impossible to press.

This time I’m getting graphite so unlike the pacific blue 12 pro, I don’t feel as much need for clear so I may get a caseology Vault which is opaque black.",best iphone case
60002,"Nautica voyage, jordan legend, davidoff cool water, st barts, tommy by tommy hilfiger, montblanc legend night. Id rank them jordan legend first in terms of scent, cool water or tommy in terms of versatility. I love the coffee in legend and its has commendable longevity and projection. Unfortunately its mostly a winter and fall scent. Cool water is in fact close to green irish tweed and they are both good for most anything, if a little more of a mainstream green fresh scent. Tommy by tommy is a new one i tried and liked, its decently unique and usable. Voyage and st barts are mostly warm weather scents, id put voyage above st barts tbh, i like the musk and its stronger. Ive gotten a lot of sunscreen comments on st barts, but its still good, although weak. Montblanc legend night is a great gourmand scent, deep, dark, and syrupy is how i describe it. Performance and projection isnt great though admittedly, and i prefer jordan legend which i think serves around the same purpose, so im giving away the Montblanc to my friend.",best perfume

- Decent public healthcare
- Great education system
- Peaceful, quiet, relaxing place to live and bring up a family
- Incredible, unique landscape and really nice down to earth people


Not so great

- Auckland weather and traffic (easily fixed by not living in Auckland)
- Being so far from everything means things like fuel can be expensive, leading to a lot of other things also being quite expensive
- House prices are through the fucking roof. 
- Average pay and cost of living.",best country to live in
