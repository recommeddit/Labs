64159,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I've got a love/hate relationship with Calibre. It's addicting to fill in all that metadata. It's annoying that it doesn't support subfolder organisation (e.g. like most music players (iTunes, MusicBee, fb2k, Dopamine, WMP, etc.) do).

This becomes a problem now that I've got an Android-based eReader, and all that metadata and organisation in Calibre is worthless because no eReader app on Android supports it, and I'm going to have to manually create loads of folders to organise the ebooks."

21213,best workout music,"I listen to music every now and then, but 90% of the time I'm lifting without it.   I find the phone extremely distracting due to calls and text messages coming in, and lose focus extremely quickly. On top of that, I enjoy listening to myself talk and motivate myself.  I can focus on my breathing, form, and keeping my grunt level in check."
33970,best Pokemon game,Isn’t it a little bit weird to start later in the series? Or does that not mater that much?
55148,best places to hike in the east coast,"If you got nothing going on, look.up rocky top trail crew.  It's a volunteer trail crew for the AT in the smokys.  I did this for the whole season after my.hike.  It runs from late August to October.   You go out for 8 days and your 6 miles up on the ridgeline.  You have a free place to stay in between hitches and all the free food you can eat!   This was the perfect reentry.for me.

I planned to do the PCT in 2015, but I came back to town and spent all winter getting beefcake in the gym.  My hike took a toll on me.  I'm 6'1 and I weighed 138 when I got to New Hampshire.

Then I somehow managed to get a job in my career again and.they offered me a 20% raise over what I was making.

I literally dream of long distance hiking regularly.  Right now I'm back in the grind, getting a little more established and slowly chipping away at other life goals... But one day man...  I'm going to be back out there living the dream, cruising across the PCT and CDT with just my back pack and not a care in the world."
71385,best movies with a cool twist,"Hey man! So I'm on a journey to watch the films that were suggested me under this post, and I just finished Lucky Number Slevin. And damn I knew the beginning of the film with the death of the family will be important, and fun fact that I thought that they didn't show the kid getting killed because well, you can't just show a kid getting killed on screen. And damn, this was so smart at the end, I had the same feeling when I was watching Oldboy. I didn't know what was going on in the whole movie but the twist hit me like a truck! Brilliant movie, not in my TOP10, but still brilliant! Thank you for the suggestion! :)"
62754,Best Data Science textbook,"I think we are just using different definitions and so let me define my terms and explain my reasoning.

**Rigorous**: I use this to meant that you've followed best practices and have subjected your scrutiny to the work of others. Why I reserve this term almost exclusively for the work of those that have done this at the graduate level is because they've usually published in peer\-reviewed journals of which leaders in the field \(far smarter than they are\) have critiqued their work. You're free to use a different definition but that's the one I use. Nate Silver has done none of this so I don't consider him to be a ""rigorous statistician"".

**Non\-introductory**: I consider the work done usually at the undergraduate or early undergraduate level to be ""introductory"" and the more advanced work done during graduate classes to be ""non\-introductory"". The latter category is only really done by those upperclassmen in the respective major or graduate students in that or a related field. I have not seen Nate Silver work with concepts beyond the ""introductory"" not least of which is because he and his team conduct their work with opacity. Again, you are free to use a different definition \(not saying you're wrong or I'm right just that we can't come to a conclusion while using different frameworks of thought\).

I also never said he *didn't* make statistics interesting, only that his statistics is not rigorous a la my previously definition of what rigor is. I never said it was a bad suggestion necessarily only that there should be the caveat that his work shouldn't be confused for rigorous data science/statistics."
32412,best vacation resort,"I work in travel and from the resorts and areas I have been to, I would say the Barcelo complex in the Mayan Riviera would be a good bet for you. There is so much to do there, it's massive. Close to any sort of excursion you would want to do as well. They just built there own excursion park that has zip-lining and all that jazz too. Its pretty amazing what they were able to build. The gym there is outstanding too, if that's something you look for."

16664,best pet for toddlers,"Do you HAVE to feed them crickets or can you feed them something else?

>Lots of people discourage using a sand substrate because if they eat it accidentally it can get impacted in their guts and kill them.

That I did know, actually, from watching an episode of *The Incredible Dr. Pol*. This dude brought in his gecko and it was all kinds of jacked up because he put sand in the cage instead of something else. Dr. Pol fixed it (IIRC) but he was like, ""Don't fuck this shit up again. Get rid of the sand. Sand is bad."""
2945,best webcamera,Camera shaming lmao
68401,best science fiction novel,"Kind of an interesting intersection with that and this quote I picked up from Dune, which I finally read recently: ""A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob."""
