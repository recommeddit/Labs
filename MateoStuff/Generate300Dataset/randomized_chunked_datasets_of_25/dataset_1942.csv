Imagine that you wanted something expensive for your birthday...something that you wouldn't normally purchase for yourself because it was so expensive. Now, picture someone buying it for you (or several people going in together) and you get it...super exciting...you have this thing that you would have NEVER purchased.

Now, picture those same people going in together and giving you the money to buy it yourself. Economists have found that the person who received the cash is actually LESS LIKELY to purchase the item the cash was intended for...because once they have the cash in hand they rationally don't want to spend that much on something (just like before...when you wouldn't want to buy it yourself)...you want to pay your bills or something else.
