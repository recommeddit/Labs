"I just spent the past our reading all your posts, RIP productivity."
"GKMC had some of the best beats and amazing mastering. It seriously never gets old...,"
Wouldn't recommend because of one thing: the back material is crazy rough and mine ruined a lot of my shirts last summer by making the lower back area pill like crazy.
Any brand suggestions?
"All I can say is do NOT get the XR. I've regretted it since buying it. Works fine but it's just a bit too large/clunky, it clearly is lower quality than the other phones. I bought it when the 11 was out, and should have bought an XS instead."
"I liked the first half.  I felt like it was just too over the top and unrealistic when it came to the battles, and the advanced technology the Nazis supposedly had at their disposal."
"The only one I actually care for is rockstar juiced. It's the one in an orange can and contains quite a bit of actual juice (along with assorted sugars and caffeine I'm sure). 

It tastes descent and it's the only one of the energy drinks where I have a truly noticeable feeling of 'oh shit, I'm all amped up'. 

Other than that, energy drinks are like medicine. I only drink them if I'm trying to stay awake on a late night drive or something like that."

"Ive been using a muted forest for 5 years now on everything. Flips sold easily, apartments rent quickly. Im pleased with not having to use gray. It also allows for white trims and wood trims in the same space without any real clash, which is cool for rehabbing."
Thinking finance as a major--any advice?
"Red headed slut, Jager with peach schnapps and a bit of cranberry juice that sits on top."
"So, you have violated both your criteria several times then? Or maybe you are just in the military?  
  
Personally, I have lived and worked in 6 different countries and have never had any criteria such as yours for a new job."
"I had the Panasonic RP-HTX7-G1 for a while and they were good, at least for me, not sure about you. They are extremely durable and quite cheap I think."
"The games that have been the biggest hit with my friend recently are Guillotine and Spot It.

Both are quick to learn, portable, cheap and have good replay value."
"Before the pandemic, I could get brand name travel sized handsantizers at dollar stores (Purell/germx) for a dollar"
"It's probably not the cool answer, but yeah, Hillary Clinton. As a young liberal, I'm thrilled that I'm living in an era where a woman has a real chance of becoming the president, especially one as progressive and as strong as she. May many more women presidents follow her."

"By flossing, is regular flogging what is best, or can just using a couple of floss sticks to get between all of the teeth to work just as well?  

I'm an uncoordinated doof, who can't seem to be do a really awesome flossing job without causing gum bleeding.  But with those sticks, i feel like I get more control."
"I was in an airport lineup for Starbucks talking to my sister about water brands, and I just start saying, 

""I hate Fiji water, "" as the lady behind me reaches out to grab a bottle of it. Not the best timing. 


I think it's creepy though, it just tastes too soft. It just flutters down your throat and you don't feel refreshed at all, just sort of violated. I tried defending that point in the lineup, but I only kept making it worse. 


After that I just kept walking into people and standing in everyone's ways by accident. It was a small scale disaster."
This has been my experience as well. AT&T doesn't congest often.
"Costco has pretty nice ones every now and then. I got an, I think 15lbs one for about $70 from there. Has a nice soft removable cover so you can wash it. Was a good purchase."
"The fresh water from the river 500feet from my house taste the best. :D 

Who buys water! ha hah
