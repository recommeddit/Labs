65257,best phone service company,"I've neglected to thank you for this list. For that, apologies. Thank you so much. 

I discovered a mvno that does not deprioritize called Pulse Cellular and runs all three major networks. Pricey but perhaps a better deal than many post paid plans. 

Thans again."
26316,best politician,"Henry Clay was really important towards the formation of the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850, which were negotiated to ease tensions between the North and South before the Civil War. Of course, we know that didn't work out, but he was still a very noteworthy politician for a very long period of American history."

ALSO

100% Try out The Name of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

Brandon's worldbuilding is the best I have ever read, and I read A LOT.

Rothfuss' Name of The Wind is amazingly adventurous, big book but I read it in one sitting!

Enjoy whatever you choose to read next anyway!"

71399,best movies with a cool twist,"I saw both in theaters, but was a little young when I saw Planet Of The Apes.   (It still blew my tiny little mind.)"
31592,best hotel to live in,"Leela Palace New Delhi stands out for me. Spectacular room, excellent shower, and attentive service. Breakfast was great. Management were extremely accommodating and seemed more interested in creating a long term relationship over nickel and diming. The gym facilities and pool were also great. This hotel was built as a trophy property without full consideration to maximizing profit as seen by room size and amount. I have tried to adopt some of these customer service philosophies in my own business."
7074,best iPhone,"I guess I just don’t notice it making that big of a difference. Yeah the true blacks are nice for watching video but outside of that, it doesn’t really wow me over the lcd. Its definitely not the huge difference like when looking at a big lcd to oled tv. At least for me"

25805,best cricket teams of all time,He Kolpaked
36026,best alcoholic drink,"Learn to sip whiskey. It is a good skill to have, and if you drink water you are more likely to feel alright the next day."
60777,Best comedy show on Netflix,I was hoping someone had recommended this. Shook me deep
4423,best text editor,"Doesn't matter how many packages you've installed, Sublime will always be a text editor, not an IDE."
