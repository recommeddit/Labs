I recall *The Worm Ouroboros* by Eddison being somewhat similar to LoTR, but I'll defer to someone who's read it this decade.

The Culture Series by Iain M. Banks is somewhat similar, in a sci-fi/space opera setting.  First book is *Consider Phlebas*.  The books are all separate stories, but form a massive story arc in the Culture universe.

Finally suggestion is the Allan Quatermain series, by H. Rider Haggard.  Adventures in African during the Scramble for Africa.  Includes *King Solomon's Mines*.",best action and adventure novel series

>Said ""Okay"" to save face, but she never forgave

>It's only so many ways you can say grace

>In truth, she rather cry at your grave

>All black regalia, we back not speakin'

>Back behind bougainvillea, you can't peek in

>Marginalia, busy with symbols and equations

>The story too simple to calculate it, payment post-dated

>The pavement gave way to a thicket of thorns

>Where the body lay naked as the day I was born

>She rocked my teeth in a necklace, gulped blood from a horn

>Ruby Woo, facin' Mecca, hair disheveled and torn

>She left what was left in a ditch, she dream of the sex

>She finished on top and howled in the crook of my neck

>She dragged the bones home and built a bed

>She drank Rosé out the skull but held it gentle as my living head

18037,"Kim: i think she’s genuinely funny, in a self-aware way. the video of her telling north why she’s famous is proof that kim is hilarious. / kim promotes unhealthy body image, like posting videos of khloe calling her anorexic. she needs to stop! also, she enables kanye’s problematic behavior and egotism.

Kris: kris is totally unselfaware and hilarious. she’s sort of pathetic and powerful in equal measures. i also think she cares a lot about her family and tried to support caitlin. / kris didn’t instill a proper sense of reality and privilege in kendall and kylie. she kind of stopped parenting them when they were like 15. she’s too concerned with being a cool mom, and doesn’t provide moral guidance for her kids

Kourtney: she has a really acerbic wit and dry humour. she is very honest and perceptive. / kourtney is massively entitled and thinks that just because she puts her kids first, everyone else has to. she uses her kids as an excuse for her selfishness.

Khloe: her behavior is the most entertaining and she definitely keeps it real with her sisters. her comments are usually the most entertaining because she’ll read her sisters for filth. / She is a bit pathetic when it comes to men and seems to crave their validation above all else, so she forgives their bad behavior and acts like it a woman’s duty to do so. 

Kendall: she’s the most private which is guess is resepctable? honestly i can’t think of one funny kendall story from the whole show. however, i think it was admirable how she fought for her dad to be accepted by the family. / she seems to think her family background means she wasn’t taken seriously as a model, rather than crediting her family’s fame as the main reason she ever made it big. 

Kylie: she’s the most driven, it seems like she really know what she wants and tries to get it. in this way she might be contrasted with kendall, who is pretty lazy. kylie could literally do anything. / she is pretty guilty of promoting a culture which profits from trends and styles appropriated from the black community",best Kardashian
6780,"iPhone X for me. 

I upgraded to every iPhone (except the 5S) in the past, but once I got the X I’ve been happy with it for 3 years. Arguably I didn’t need the previous upgrades either, but the X was truly forward looking at the time. It’s the iPhone I’ve used the most, and I just love most of the decisions they made with the design:

-	the first OLED iPhone 
-	the first “all screen” iPhone 
-	first FaceID device
-	the A11 was their first bionic architecture — being able to use the high efficiency and high performance cores in tandem makes a big difference vs. the A10 fusion design
-	the gestural interface is amazing and essentially defined how a buttonless interface should work industry wide 
-	the rounded stainless steel frame and glass front/back is one of their best looking and most premium feeling designs IMO

Looking forward to the 12, however!",best iPhone

31440,"I did not speak Dutch, but this was not for lack of trying. I just got so sick of people automatically answering in English every time I tried, and I eventually gave up. People would just not try unless you already had at least a B level of Dutch under your belt. For context, I moved to Germany after and learned more German in a month than I did Dutch in Holland in five years, and where I was in Germany had a generally excellent standard of English. As for work, I was blue collar all the way. Background was in TV and eventually I got something in a similar field, but I did everything possible in between, in slightly decreasing stages of crappiness to get by. Started non skilled black labouring, cleaning toilets, dosh washing etc. up to varying levels of service job, and finally got a ""real"" job in my field after 3 years of toil. What made it worse was that once i started getting jobs where Dutch people were also hired, they were always paid more and treated better, even those of similar rank and seniority. For added salt in the wound, their access to social housing also meant they paid far less rent, and many would cover this entirely by illegally renting their spare room to a foreigner.

* Engineering 
* Computer science
* computer anything
* something in health care ( I don't know any specific degrees)
* math

I think more recently business degrees are less likely to provide a quick 'in' to a good job. A LOT of people get them. so the market is saturated with business administration and marketing grads.

56329,"Thanks for your reply! I am leaning towards the Dell because its on sale now where I live and in stock and from reviews I've seen it is very good. 

I've just watched the Hardware Unboxing video of the MSI MAG that I mentioned above and it seems to surpass the Dell and LG slightly in all areas, but it's roughly €160 more expensive than the Dell and LG, so I'm a bit torn on what to go for. Not sure if I should fork out the extra for the MSI.

As for the glow, is that something you would notice while using the monitor for gaming & working? Or is it only noticeable when the monitor is on standby? If it only happens on standby I don't think it would bother me at all.",best desktop monitor
