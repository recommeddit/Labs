"New phone user! How much would a SIM card cost ? I might just buy a new phone since the one I have has a battery draining problem(ip7). As a student, I probably need unlimited data since I’m bad with directions."
I also loved ft but I've heard the construction has made it quite a bit less enjoyable
How thoughtful. My dad would probably be scared to use it and it would go bad lol. I love him
At this point my playlist has mostly eminems songs
I can't go to the gym for  a workout without Survivor's Eye of the Tiger blasting on my Walkman.
"I recommend running Amazon together with Admob with a mediation service (easiest is Admob's). Amazon ads usually pay much more than Admob but the fillrate is low, around 50%. With mediation you can fall back to Admob when there are no ads provided."

Two different girls that I know have said they pretty much pounce on anybody that wears Cool Water by Davidoff.
Sherlock Holmes?
"Went back to Firefox after the nonsense with Chrome as of late, works great for me."
"I feel like the KD stuff is off, especially considering how low their attendance is."
"20 years ago, Clinton having smoked pot was controversial to some. Now no one talks about Obama's pot use. 

In the future, there will be more leeway given to sexting, for instance. Almost everyone will have done it. So a dick pic won't kill your political career."

"> Because there's also no Bayesian smoothing happening to the rating here

There actually is! But it's a smaller data set and a smaller crowd so, yeah, niche games are still gonna get more play on this list."
"I do agree that this is a bit annoying when I’ve copied a repo to add, done the business I wanted etc. a little later I open zebra for whatever reason and it asks me if I want to add the repo. Erm... no I don’t, but thank you for asking me. Each and every time. 

But, I do love Zebra, mainly because I love simplicity. While I do still like Sileo’s design, it feels a bit... bloated? Idk."
This ^. Nothing beats this.
Afraid so brother - they DO make a diet version. Most bars do not carry it though.
Top of the Lake was fantastic.
I always watch tv with subtitles for this reason. You miss so many jokes by not using CC
Triangle - super clever mind-fuck of a horror movie with some great twists and turns along the way. Not a single one of which I saw coming.
"I always prefer cydia. It may not be the fastest but it's always worked for me. 

Actually though, over the past couple weeks, I have tried zebra, and even installer the last couple days. I really like installer. I don't know if I'm going to replace cydia with either of those but they're definitely giving cydia a run for its money"
People can’t talk and chew gum?
Hey come on. If we could google it all the sub literally would not exist.
"Here's a little trick I picked up.
1. Take cinnamon rolls and unroll them except one. 
2. Put the rolled one in the middle and roll the rest of them around it and make a giant cinnamon roll 
3. Set for 10-15 minutes
4. Boom cinnamon roll cake"
"1. Exhale by Joel Abernathy
2. Betrothed by Claire Cullen
3. Diamond in the Rough by Charlie Cochet
4. Something Wild and Perfect & All the Little Lights by Julia McBryant (both books are about the same couple)
5. Sweet Nothings by Macy Blake

Honorable Mention (i.e. guilty pleasure): Fire From The Sea by Noah Harris and Rowan Porter

Aside from all being MM romances, there's nothing they really have in common.  2 are paranormal, 1 is non-shifter omegaverse, 2 are contemporary one of which is a bodyguard thriller and the other is rich kids of the south.  4 of them (and the honorable mention) have an MC who's in a really bad position in life for whatever reason - that's the only commonality I can think of."
