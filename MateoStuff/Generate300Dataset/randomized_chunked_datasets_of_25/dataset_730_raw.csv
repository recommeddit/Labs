"I have been burned by HDMI so often that I refuse to even try. If you can get DP, then always go with DP. 

I use iVANKY DP and DP to HDMI cables. I'm quite okay with them.

DP to Hdmi because my work laptop doc only has DP out, and monitors have only one DP in.

And gaming KVM switches are not a thing yet."

"When I was in the Army I had a Major that would run with the Mortal Kombat theme going. He was bad ass.

Edit: For me its Bad Company Five Finger Death Punch"
No shit. I have it preordered. It is not on blu ray yet.
"AirVPN, Windscribe, Mullavad."
So then what do they use? Just off the shelf regressions or random effects models? Why isn't that popular on the job?

I disagree about Upgrade but the others are good

"Its just my favourites list bro. Iam a fan of simple, idle relaxing turn based games."
"With all the hype around xsoft recently, I was debating in between a soft or xsoft otsu v2.

"The Yakuza series. Yeah, its a brawler/beat-em-up, but its also chock full of RPG mechanics like random encounters, leveling skills, equipment, and shit tons of dialogue and various activities. Easily can get 50-100 hours out of each title."
"Well, drawing a dividing line between the study of statistics and the application of probability is pretty nearly impossible. In practice statistics is often taken as this horrible little booklet of broken methods which are (slightly) better than nothing, but underneath that surface misinterpretation is an incredibly rich connection to statistical mechanics. It's in fact difficult to separate the two theoretically.

I haven't read Shrodinger's book, though, so I haven't a clue whether what he talks about is relevant."
"Agreed on Liverpool, not so sure about Bayern."
Splendor has become the go-to game for me and my wife - it plays quick but with so much depth

"It's amazing how much less the dryer eats your socks once you do this.   Oh found a single?  Toss it off to the side, it's mate will either show back up or you'll lose another one and you're back up to a complete collection:)"
"I mean maybe, but if the box gets opened, it's not gonna change anything.  I think they're just MASKS FOR YOUR FACE because that's the image they're trying to portray.  Something about how they're more than (sun)glasses which can sit in the background of one's outfit, whereas these are supposed to help highlight you/your outfit/whatever.  Plus ""masks"" sounds like art pieces more than just some wearable."
"I await to be up 3-1 to channel the state curse, and then do the best Atlanta braves impersonation and end with a broken heart. I always tell myself I wouldnt fall for it. But its hope everytime. Its an endless cycle"
"Whelp, that is the opposite of what I was trying to say! I think I have fixed the ambiguous wording now. Thanks for the heads up."
