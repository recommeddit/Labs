The cheaper alternative is IKEA cabinets. For what you pay, usually comparable to big box store cabinets, you get a very good RTA.

**Edit:** Barker Cabinets doesn't do the usual ""let us send you a quote, and give us your phone number and email address so we can keep spamming you"" thing. Want to know exact prices? Build the cabinets you want on their website. You get to see how much different options cost in the drop-down menus as you pick them.",best home improvement store
44976,A tens unit.  When I was a kid I had both of my shoulders partially dislocated. They've always ached and hurt since then. As I got older the pain got worse.  Especially if I've done anything during the day that utilized my shoulder.  A friend brought over a tens unit for me to borrow. I loved It so much that I bought my own. I used it daily for 3 months working my way up to the highest level. The pain went away and never came back.,best items under $100

As for what you can do, virtually everything. You'll be better equipped to deal with most jobs by having a CS background and learning what you need specifically afterwards than the other way around.

22839,"I second this about Morgan Freeman.

I work working at an event in Hollywood, and my entire job was to greet the celebs as they got out of their car and walk them to the elevator. The distance between car and elevator was maybe 30 feet or so, in other words not long at all.

When Morgan Freeman drove up, I walked up to him and said my spiel ""Good evening Mr Freeman, welcome to the <Event name here>, I will be your escort to right about here.""

The amount of time it took me to say that was the exact amount of time it took to walk from the car to the elevator. After I said that, he stopped and looked at me and said: ""That's it? We don't get to spend any more time together?""

I said ""No sir. This is the end of the line for me!""

He looked at my name tag, shakes my hand and said: ""<Name>, I'll never forget the time we spent together."" Just him saying that to me gave me chills. Later in the evening when the guests were leaving it was a mad house, but in the midst of the crowd I see Morgan Freeman. We are walking toward each other when he recognizes me. He points his finger and says ""Never forget"" as he continued to walk to his car.

This was, of course, one of the most badass moments of my life.",best celebrity
