"Depending on your proclivities, it'll either be the LDS temple, Arches Nat'l Park, the Wasatch Mountains, or perhaps the Bonneville Salt Flats.

However, as a Utah native, the most interesting thing to me is the town of Thistle. It was buried in a mudslide in the 80's and was completely abandonded. Some of the buildings still stand, although they're partially buried, and it's kinda spooky."
"Check out Mulholland Drive, it's right up your alley. One of my favorite David Lynch films."
">The Guardian Al-Jazeera BBC The Economist  
  
Bam, listed exactly what I was about to put (minus the Economist, can't handle it).  
  
Al-Jazeera is incredibly good, but has a massive stigma attached to it. Someone asked me the other day ""Isn't that a muslim propaganda station?""  
  
On the other hand, the Times is sensationalist, etc etc, but is viewed as one of the best media organisations in the World. BAH."
"I see this argument every time this photo is posted, and as a researcher, I very much disagree. 

If the research is published, there is no reason to not share it. Publishing is sharing it with the scientific community, already, so it's not like the researchers are gonna try and keep it secret from you."
Reading what he managed to do before he was 30 seriously put my ass in gear.
I Can't believe so many People like Roar and rank it so high. It is a disappointment to GCI.
"I've got a Osprey Comet, and I really like it. Got it for about $60 on Amazon. Comes with a lifetime warranty, and definitely has enough space for everything you can need."
"My never sell stocks are TSLA, NVDA, SQ, FB, CRM, and SNOW. I trade everything else."
For sure dude has some hidden gems. Are you into the older kmd stuff ?
It sucks being under 25. I need to borrow a friend or family members vehicle. No car rentals for me.

I ranked them in from best-worst so if you’re gunna check any out, start from the top. 

Some of these aren’t official studio debut albums. Some are mixtapes but can be considered breakout projects so I included them anyway."
"Buy an experience with the kids.

My favorite part of Father's Day has nothing to do with gifts, but is about spending time with the family.  Baseball game, day of fishing, beach trip, go to the movies or whatever your Dad likes to do..."
RO water isn't the best for drinking because it strips out useful minerals.
Dang. I've honestly been checking like every 2 hours every day for the week. This morning I woke up at my usual 7 AM but I didn't check right when I woke up for some reason and waited till like 8 AM (and also I read your message at like 8:30 this morning but it was not there sadly). It must have sold out in like 30 minutes. Thanks for letting me know though. I appreciate you messaging me anyway. Also congrats on buying it and I wish you the best with it. Now hopefully I can grab one with some luck.
I came to say 4-5 decent cutting boards. I have some  1/2 inch thick boards that get used daily and have held up for the last 15 years. Cooking is so much better with the right tools.
"I know this is not music, but one time I was running on a treadmill in a hotel gym and horse racing was on tv.  That shit was motivating."

"I prefer The Fullerton, and even the Shangri La in Singapore as hotels. Can't beat the pool at the Marina Bay Sands though!"
Pickle backs!

Safe starring Michael C Hall is pretty good. It’s on Netflix.
"This list is pretty terrible. The survey is designed so nobody will be able to actually vote for books they want (esurvey pro is awful). Besides that, it is weighted heavily for the early era sci-fi, as well as being just a web survey of an obscure site.

1. Books in 2010-2012  = 10
2. Books in 2000-2009 = 69
3. Books in 1990 - 1999 = 68
4. Books in 1980-1989 = 53
5. Books before 1980 = 200"
