...oh."
"Pretty sure it just bounces between the last season and then the seasons leading up to that season pretty much I chronological order. I actually found it kind of nice because you’d be able to see the players younger and older, obviously MJ in particular. 

Fantastic documentary."
"I would say so, yes. I bought a pair of Ray Ban Wayfarers whilst travelling in 2011 and they're still going strong now in 2016. Could I say the same about a pair of cheap knockoffs? I don't think so..."
Yeah I agree.
This was great. I debated getting the structure the last time I went to the store... this has me regretting not trying them!
"I took an interest in all sorts of instruments in high school. I never got the chance to be taught but I figured it out via Youtube and some very patient musician friends. After dabbling with the trumpet, stand up bass, piano, xylophone and all things drumline; I found that the guitar was the easiest. First learning fundamentals on the bass, I got good enough within a year to try the electric guitar. I feel like it’s the easiest because tabs can be picked up way faster than standard notation. Learn some basic chords, buy a capo and you can string out a ton of songs very early. The quick gratification really kept my head in practice mode."
"Hey!

If you're looking for something lightweight, we recommend the **TI-36X**. It does some calculus (no CAS), but lacks graphing.

If you're looking for something full-blown, go for the **TI CX CAS**\- its got symbolic calculus and graphing. Its costly, but powerful. Also, be aware, if you are in high school, you will not be able to use this on the ACT.

&#x200B;

For something online, we recommend **SymboLab** [https://www.symbolab.com/](https://www.symbolab.com/). The free version can solve almost anything CAS related (probably better than TI), and the paid version will also show you steps. Obviously though, you won't be able to use this on tests/quizzes.

&#x200B;

For something online that you can use on tests / quizzes, check out our app, **ClassCalc**. Its got a powerful graphing calculator as well as a strong CAS component. Also, with your teachers permission, you can use it in class. It has a non-invasive management layer that will allow a teacher to make sure you're not cheating etc during tests. You can check out a mini tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR08DXHvtGw&t=2s&list=PLZbP7IPhnt3jFY2xean-hmT\_CmnL\_DdB6&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR08DXHvtGw&t=2s&list=PLZbP7IPhnt3jFY2xean-hmT_CmnL_DdB6&index=2).

Note: Currently the app is free, so there's no cost to trying it. We just ask for honest feedback!

&#x200B;

Hope that is comprehensive and gives you the info you need to make the best choice.

"Great show, but hasn't been on Netflix in a long time. They do have it on DVD though."
"Perhaps, but I'm writing this from experience in both sectors. I haven't checked it out on reddit."
As long as people keep in mind that it is in no way how real schizophrenia works. It's an artistic interpretation of the symptoms because there's no way to actually make them look good on film.
"I bought a fixer-upper 18 months ago and we've done a ton of remodeling, so I feel like I'm required to answer this question. As stated, each individual store can vary considerably. The lowers closest to my house sucks for customer service, but the one 10 miles away is stellar. Lowe's tends to be cleaner and better laid out. However, Home Depot has a lot more options, especially online. I was very particular about the finishes I put in my house and was searching for a very specific ""look"" for each item. I was pretty disappointed with the selection at Lowe's in general. Home Depot fit the bill and had way more options for almost everything we needed (vanity, ceiling fans, etc).  

Home Depot is farthest from me, so if I need a generic bolt, doorknob, etc and I need it quick I go to Lowes. If it's anything else I tend to go to Home Depot or order from Home Depot online."
IONIQ and Leaf can be picked up incredibly cheap now.
I loved the OG and didn’t even know this existed. Thank you!!
"So Aaron Rodgers who has more tds, less interceptions, a better completion rate is number 10 but Brady is 7? Only thing Brady is ahead in is yards"
"Wow, that's fascinating, and sad. Wouldn't have thought of that, but it makes perfect sense."
"It’s pretty easy, massive number of expats here. It is not the most progressive (gay adoption, paternity leave, etc). You may still feel some of the gender inequality, e.g. official letters which state “in the presence of your husband”. The weather is relatively moderate, but the winters are very gray in many of the cities. Work weeks of 40-45, one thing I really like about Switzerland is that it is very common to work less than 100%. Many colleagues with kids will work 60-80%. 

Good cycling and hiking. Plenty of tech jobs. The cities are incredibly clean, and living is very comfortable. The summers are great, the winters I find very oppressive. 

This is from my experience in the German speaking region."
I've not seen the Josh Brolin one but from what I've heard it isn't as good. The original is probably one of the most mind blowing plot twists I've ever seen in a film and I'm not overstating the point. One of the few films i would still be happy to rewatch these days.
"Well, I like them, they are smooth as hell when you wear them right, no need to be a dick because you dislike something"
"Kind of agree with you. I just find the Economist is very easy to read, without being tabloid."
"I personally just go through my day best I can, I suck on some cold candy when I can and drink copious amounts of water. But for my friends and loves ones I usually time to make them my family's classic neck bone and radish soup. It obviously has neck bones and radish in it but also green onions, a lot of sliced ginger, MSG, salt, white pepper, and sesame oil. 

I make a pretty large pot of it to keep all day. With some bread or crackers or rice its great. Along with this, lots and lots of fluids. Hot baths. Relaxing music. Sunlight. Rest."
Thanks! That’s good to know. I figure it can’t be much worse than congestion around the SF Bay Area.
That Lil Wayne & Juelz era was truly something remarkable!
