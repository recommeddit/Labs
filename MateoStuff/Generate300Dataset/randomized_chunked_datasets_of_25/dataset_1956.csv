30503,best Mexican war to study,"There are a ton of books, but movies too. Here are two books and three movies that all do a great job with Mexico's history.

My favorite book on the Aztecs is *Daily Life of the Aztecs on the Eve of the Spanish Conquest* by Jacques Soustelle.

On the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, nothing beats reading the original letters of Hernan Cortes written to the king back in Spain. The English translation is excellent and the editor's/translator's notes correct many of Cortes' mistakes/exaggerations/lies. The English title is *Letters from Mexico* by Hernan Cortes.

If you have Netflix, I highly recommend the documentary *Patria*, dealing with the 1850s-60s, including the presidency of Santa Anna, the liberal/conservative civil war, the presidency of Benito Juarez and the French invasion.

On youtube, you can learn about the Mexican Revolution of 1910-20, as well as its precursors and aftermath, in the 2-hour documentary *The Storm that Swept Mexico*, which includes amazing archival work, painstaking film restoration and interviews with some of the leading historians on early 20th century Mexican history.

Regarding more recent issues, the disappearance of the 43 students is dealt with on Netfilx in the documentary *43*, which I also recommend."
32333,best hotel to live in,"My grandparents used to own a small motel in the Midwest and they told me multiple stories of people booking rooms just to kill themselves in. Shit is so sad, their moms would call later in the week asking if they were alright... My grandpa would have to call my uncles in to help clean the aftermath, which was mainly bodily fluids sprayed all over the walls. They never said whether they changed the mattresses or not, but with all the maggots and decomposing flesh they would find I’m sure they had to. 

This was a small, family-owned motel though. Can’t speak for the larger hotel corporations."
51128,best rap album,"Yeah, the list as a whole is very biased towards rock music, and it's not a great mix of genres by any means, especially in the top 50 or so albums, but overall they were able to incorporate a fair amount of different genres in the list, although a lot of genres were very underrepresented in the end.

In the bottom 50 for instance, we get albums from hip-hop, post-punk, synthpop, soul, proto-punk, disco, R&B, psychedelic pop, and heavy metal to name a few. Yeah, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's better than a lot of lists out there."

32427,best vacation resort,"I did an official wine tasting tour for the first time this summer in France and I definitely prefer to just buy wine at the store and drink it somewhere else. Most of the tour about the town and the processing was interesting but the actual tasting was probably the most pretentious thing I have ever done in my life. 

All the wine was delicious but none of it tasted like lasers, barbecued duck, aluminum, Snickers or whatever other notes they claimed were present."
