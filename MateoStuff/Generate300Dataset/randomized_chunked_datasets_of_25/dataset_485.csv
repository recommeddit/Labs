57576,best cologne,Is it normal to find fragrances at Costco? I can't remember ever seeing any there.
4096,best online college,"I’m doing the ALM in management and completed an internship at a fortune 50 pharma company and interviewing for another position today.

Like anything else don’t expect the program itself to allow you to waltz into a role, but in my experience people respect the name, find it interesting and are open to networking.

Also career services has been a good tool for me!
Linda is amazing and helped me navigate my experience effectively and make friends! I highly recommend it :)"

22237,best celebrity,"Mclovin, at Bonnaroo."
8256,best toothpaste,My dentists usually recommend Colgate Total
35822,best alcoholic drink,"Ah yes, the classic Doc Morgan."
23510,best car racing video game,"The difficulty progression in recent Forzas works differently: You start driving at ""novice"" difficulty and as you get better in the game, you are supposed to increase it and get bonus credits. That's really it. FH4 is even weirder, you don't even have to win races, you just need to finish them."
17354,best iOS game,How is INSIDE so low on that list?
71817,best movies with a cool twist,"Mother! 
Bird Box
Talented Mr. Ripley"
32070,best hotel to live in,"Top 3:

1) Shangri-La in Mactan, Philippines -- oh my God this place was amazing.

2) Sheraton-Moana Surfrider in Oahu, HI-- I believe it's now the Westin? It definitely changed names since I've been there. It's a BEAUTIFUL old hotel, amazing history and just a great hotel.

3) Sheridan Beach Resort and Spa, Palawan, Philippines-- it takes so long to get there (travel to the Philippines, plane from Cebu, hours long drive), but it is SO WORTH IT."
41930,movies like Inception,"If you want something trippy, US Netflix has [Madoka Magica](https://streamable.com/i84y4), a gem hidden in plain sight and a literal [GOAT contender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica#Reception) in regards to animation."

21007,best workout music,Ain't No Click - Lloyd Banks
42635,best detective show,"Person of Interest is a detective series, in a way.  It starts fairly straight-forward and develops, over 5 seasons, in to one of the greatest shows I have ever watched.  Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."
45856,best trick or treating candy,"still doesn't make it ""Halloween candy"""
71295,best movies with a cool twist,"This one may fall short since it a relatively recent comic book movie but that scene truly got me. I’m usually really good at seeing things coming in movies and the filmmakers just did a good job at hiding it and distracting me before they revealed that. Love that scene, and the subsequent ones after. So much awesome tension, and really nails the work life balance Spider-Man always struggles with"

10390,best suitcase lock,"I love that if you can afford it, the law doesn't apply to you.

EDIT: To those of you saying $100 isn't that bad, you are missing the point entirely.  Special treatment by institutions because you make more money is bullshit, period."
