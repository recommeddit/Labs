48128,best color to paint with,"If you are afraid to paint a certain color, don't paint at all. That's the only winning move.

I digress. Paint Grey, because you're neutral, timeless, and, practical.

But seriously 'Prince lover' should at least get you into the purple category."
45459,best gaming system,"Sorry, I downvoted initially. I mistook 360 for Xbox One.

35621,best alcoholic drink,People under 21 making shopping lists for their friends over 21.
68549,best science fiction novel,"I am not sure if it is a rut, or if the genre splintered so much that tastes and fandoms have split up as well.  For example there are a bunch of books for singularity, cyborgs, space travel, far future, time travel, etc.  People have split up in those areas.

There is also the fact that sci-fi TV shows and movies have sucked up a lot of that fandom as well.  After you've seen Stargate, any book about a similar plot will get compared to it as well.  Considering the number of Stargate episodes and the richness being added to them by the actors themselves, it is entirely too easy to compare the book to your favorite episodes, resulting in a lower score.  That's excluding the books written in the world of that TV show, potentially resulting in a somewhat derivative work.

Not to mention that people have a limited amount of free time and attention span.  If you spend so much of it on the sci-fi on TV, Netflix, Amazon, and movies, then less attention and time is spent on equivalent books.

These things are not so when talking about the fantasy genre - compared to sci-fi, there is very little live-action fantasy.  Besides GoT I can't think of any high production fantasy show on right now."

52351,best hiphop album,"List is shit to be honest.  But any top 10 is going to fall down somewhere.  But Kendrick did not make the 2 best hip-hop albums of all time.  Kanye has not made a top 10 hip-hop record of all time.  No De La Soul, Mobb Deep, Fugees, Dre, Outkast, Biggie, Common, Jay Z."

59868,best perfume,"My collection is a little excessive, but my favorite ever is “Laila” by Geir Ness.
