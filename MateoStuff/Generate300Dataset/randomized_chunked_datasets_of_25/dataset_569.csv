I did not do anything with my teeth for that 2 year period other than brushing them with water on a toothbrush. Right now I floss and brush them, to see if there's any difference."

46105,best trick or treating candy,I mean... its a fun holiday and you don’t have to participate but its more fun the more participate. I highly disagree with the sentiment that ANYONE should get trashed on for not providing candy or “good enough” candy... those guys can fuck right off the privileged little shits... but if YOU don’t want to participate thats your deal and yours alone and no one actually gives a shit about your opinions on the matter. If we want to dress up and give out candy thats our business as not doing it is yours. So you can kindly shut the fuck up sir.

Charles Bukowski - The Continual Condition;
Richard Feynman - What do you care what other people think;
Steven Pinker - How the Mind Works;
Christopher Hitchens - The Portable Atheist;
Rudolph Rocker - Anarcho-Syndicalism;
Bertrand Russell - A History of Western Philosophy;
Eric Davidson - The Gunk Punk Undergut;

Every time the ball hits the ground  the fuzz collects fine grit and sand, essentially turning the outer surface into fine grit sandpaper.
