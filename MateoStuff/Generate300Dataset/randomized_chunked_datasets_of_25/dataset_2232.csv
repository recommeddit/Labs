22919,best celebrity,"I love her, I think she's funnier than people give her credit for, but man if you want to waste some hours and laugh watch some of her interviews from when she was like 17. She was ridiculous, one of those people who probably grew up too fast and has always been an adult which is just funny to see when she was so young. This one in particular http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDzWGHNQbI It's also interesting to see how she fields questions about her love life."
57888,best cologne,"Yep, exactly the one.

I didn't even really like it at the time of the purchase; I had tried a ton out at the counter at a Nordstroms and this was the one I 'settled' with.

I've come to really enjoy it."
60865,Best comedy show on Netflix,No offense with Theo Von. That guy is a lunatic but in a good way.
24930,best spiderman actor,Yea i def agree
54967,best water filter,"I'm not sure about the particular model you have, but ours has a small display on top, near the handle, with bars (similar to mobile phone signal indicators) which tell you when you need to change the filter.

If I were cynical I'd imagine they're safe a lot longer than Brita tell you,"
70632,best movies with a cool twist,There's no correct answer. There's a variety of answers.
65558,best phone service company,"It's not the cell band, it's Apple. Even 5G doesn't work, despite both the phone and TMo supporting it. Voicemails are crappy, and WiFi calling completely unsupported.

Apple has privileged relationships with carriers, and Google is not one of them (I guess it comes down to money. Google doesn't sell iPhone as part as Fi deals, and Apple doesn't let them work on iPhones).

You're better off using TMo directly on iPhone."
23035,best celebrity,"I'm a helicopter pilot and had the displeasure of flying Justin Bieber, his father and a couple of his douchey friends. He lives up to his reputation and was incredibly rude."
70985,best movies with a cool twist,"I am surprised nobody mentioned ""Se7en"". Has arguably the best ending and reveal of all time. Also, I would mention Memento too."
17968,best Kardashian,"1. Kourtney

7788,best laptop for general use,"Sure, it is the furthest to the left here (I have an additional discount). The pen is a non factor- I have my own anyway. https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/Lenovo-Yoga-C740-14/p/88YGC701292. The problem is the inferior display on the FLex 5, 250 nits seems peanuts on paper compared to others as well as the color accuracy. However, if it is THAT drastic of performance difference I will reevaluate."
71268,best movies with a cool twist,"Probably due to recency bias, but I thought Searching had an amazing twist that I personally didn't see coming. The movie made you think that it could end in a few different ways and just when I start believing in one, they introduce another possibility."

60051,best perfume,"Ulric Varens is nice. I have [Sublime](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ulric-de-Varens/Sublime-26122.html) and it doesn’t smell cheap at all. I got it for like $11.

Mariah Carey [M](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mariah-Carey/M-1151.html) is hella unexpectedly good. I’m also fond of all of the Britney Spears perfumes I’ve smelled, especially [Curious](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Britney-Spears/Curious-141.html)

Perfumers Workshop [Tea Rose](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Perfumer-s-Workshop/Tea-Rose-5512.html) is great. It smells really similar to some more expensive rose scents. I think I got my 1oz bottle for $6 including shipping.

The nose behind Elizabeth Arden [Green Tea](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elizabeth-Arden/Green-Tea-83.html) is Francis Kurkdjian (it also costs less than $10)

Also, Salvador Dali perfumes tend to be really cheap and I really like the ones I’ve tried. La Rive makes really decent dupes of designer scents for incredibly cheap. Also—shoutouts to both Demeter and Bath and Body Works. Both have a ton of scents I like."

17312,best iOS game,Anyone know how well San Andreas plays with a controller? I’m one of the 3 people who haven’t played it and I really wouldn’t mind playing it on my phone with my Xbox controller clip.
19873,best workout music,I might be crucified for this but xxxtentacion has some songs that will make you want to do a thousand push ups
