22919,"I love her, I think she's funnier than people give her credit for, but man if you want to waste some hours and laugh watch some of her interviews from when she was like 17. She was ridiculous, one of those people who probably grew up too fast and has always been an adult which is just funny to see when she was so young. This one in particular http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDzWGHNQbI It's also interesting to see how she fields questions about her love life.",best celebrity
57888,"Yep, exactly the one.

I didn't even really like it at the time of the purchase; I had tried a ton out at the counter at a Nordstroms and this was the one I 'settled' with.

I've come to really enjoy it.",best cologne

65558,"It's not the cell band, it's Apple. Even 5G doesn't work, despite both the phone and TMo supporting it. Voicemails are crappy, and WiFi calling completely unsupported.

Apple has privileged relationships with carriers, and Google is not one of them (I guess it comes down to money. Google doesn't sell iPhone as part as Fi deals, and Apple doesn't let them work on iPhones).

You're better off using TMo directly on iPhone.",best phone service company

The problem is the inferior display on the FLex 5, 250 nits seems peanuts on paper compared to others as well as the color accuracy. However, if it is THAT drastic of performance difference I will reevaluate.",best laptop for general use

60051,"Ulric Varens is nice. I have [Sublime](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ulric-de-Varens/Sublime-26122.html) and it doesn’t smell cheap at all. I got it for like $11.

Mariah Carey [M](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mariah-Carey/M-1151.html) is hella unexpectedly good. I’m also fond of all of the Britney Spears perfumes I’ve smelled, especially [Curious](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Britney-Spears/Curious-141.html)

Perfumers Workshop [Tea Rose](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Perfumer-s-Workshop/Tea-Rose-5512.html) is great. It smells really similar to some more expensive rose scents. I think I got my 1oz bottle for $6 including shipping.

The nose behind Elizabeth Arden [Green Tea](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elizabeth-Arden/Green-Tea-83.html) is Francis Kurkdjian (it also costs less than $10)

Also, Salvador Dali perfumes tend to be really cheap and I really like the ones I’ve tried. La Rive makes really decent dupes of designer scents for incredibly cheap. Also—shoutouts to both Demeter and Bath and Body Works. Both have a ton of scents I like.",best perfume
