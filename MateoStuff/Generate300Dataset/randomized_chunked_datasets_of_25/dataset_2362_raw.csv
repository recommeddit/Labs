"My English Bull Terrier loves kids.  She's super shy of strangers but will approach children. She loves to play with my 3 year old and let's him pet her. But I'm very strict about how he's allowed to play and interact with her.That said, terriers are not particularly recommended for first time dog owners, but I think it can be ok if you do your research and go in with your eyes open."
