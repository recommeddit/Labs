47004,"Sanitizers almost always use alcohol, which bacterial cells don’t really have any cellular means of developing resistance against.  You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)

EDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).

-  Alcohol doesn’t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn’t give a fuck about alcohol.

- Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.

- Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions.",best hand santizer brand

27093,"No you just don’t get the minis (which are meh) and more cards. But the price was substantially higher so this is a great starting point. 
The bone dice accessory is pretty cool, the journal and notebook meh.
Any additional expansion stuff you get for the game just adds to the exploration which you aren’t even guaranteed of seeing in your play through.
So I say don’t sweat it and just order the base and you’ll be fine",best board games
12116,"My most memorable birthday was my 21st birthday.  Not because I got shitfaced, but because I went kayaking with my best friend.  We did drink, and being able to walk into the grocerie store and buy my own beer was great.  We didn't even go that far, just up the road from his house and down the river that fed into a lake, but it was a beautiful day.  Just him, me, a few beers, and mother nature.  Never going to forget that one, it was just so simple, so great.",best gifts for dad

In no particular order and plenty of options in Asia for the OP...

1.) Four seasons Ubud (3500 square foot room with private pool on the river)


2.) Four seasons Hong Kong (service in club level was the best I’ve ever received)


3.) ritz Carlton Nusa Dua (5000 square foot room with a private lap pool on balcony)


4.) JA Manafaru Maldives


5.) Ritz Carlton Central Park (10000 square foot room overlooking park, they knocked down walls to create this room for a prince to live in for a year... negotiated this upgrade for free based on status)


6.) mandarin oriental Bangkok (original one, new wing of rooms... the best service ever, they drive you around in brand new 7 series, I left my safe open with a Rolex/Patek and they secured it/wrote a note, and excellent service from everybody I encountered)",best hotel to live in
