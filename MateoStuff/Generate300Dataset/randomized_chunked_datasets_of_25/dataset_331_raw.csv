"i tried mint. i like it but all it does is show my spending habits and not an app to actually make budgets. 
or am i dumb and not seeing it? lol"
"Thanks a lot for taking the time to respond to my question! I'll look into Terraforming Mars, and play a couple games of it on Tabletop Simulator before I decide whether or not I want to get it, but I've watched a couple videos on Codenames, and it seems like it would be really good for me to introduce some of my friends to something other than Monopoly / CAH."
"U can also hold down L1 and press left/right to switch btwn 0, 2x and 4x"
Ooooooor it just smells nice
I always feel shitty after eating a ton of carbs. Seems like a completely reasonable statement to me.
I love VIM. I use it for coding web applications front and back.
Publish or perish at the expense of the students paying money for an education they won't receive is the true problem.
:(
"We hit knoebels, hershey and dorney last weekend. Hands down, knoebels gets my vote (havent been to kw). Skyrush for me, is still the best coaster in the state, but Twisters not far off."
"Yes, because that's why people fail, lower response time.

And I doubt any pro gamer is winning due to TN either, he'd win either way if he's better."
"I know what it shows, but then again why do you think nobody uses this method to judge clubs? And i'm not even talking about Inter vs Juve, i confronted us with Arsenal, and you think they are a better european club than us or Ajax? If you want to talk Juve, that same table puts them above Milan which is the second club beyond Real Madrid for CL wins. Nobody, and i mean nobody, would suggest that Juve is a better european club than Milan, but that table suggests exactly that."
"Burj Al Arab, Dubai, UAE. You’ve probably seen photos. It’s subtly shaped like a ship’s sail out in the water [(photo)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Al_Arab#/media/File%3ABurj_Al_Arab%2C_Dubai%2C_by_Joi_Ito_Dec2007.jpg)  and is said to be the only 7-star hotel in the world. Of course, I think they gave themselves that designation, but it doesn’t take away from the amazing 8-room suites. (Living room, kitchen, dining room, bar, 2 bedrooms, sitting area and these incredible bathrooms.) These are the smallest accommodations they have. It just gets bigger and more insane from there.
The food was similarly incredible. The hallways even were stunning, open all the way to the roof and designed in bright splashed of color, also found in the hand-tiled elaborate mosaics. Was seriously breathtaking."
"LinkedIn is basically a resume site.  

I set my social media profiles to only show my posts to ""friends"" after there were a few cases of hr getting someone in trouble for something they posted on social media. (I think it's absurd that this would happen but why take the risk when I can just turn it off?)."
"$65 big comfy winter parka from an army surplus in Toronto. Trust me ive been going to them for years, and its great to find parkas, rain coats, and little gadgets."

"That's the thing tho. Before the movie came out, in what I can only imagine was an attempt to stop spoilers, they said the movie was not going to be part 1 of 2. It's obviously a two part film but if critics treated it as standalone because that's what the studio told them I have no gripe with them not liking it as much."
So I wouldn't have to overclock with the 2600x?
Check out Perris and Elsinore and see which place you like the feel of best - both are top notch.
"Not to mention the entire series has been the result of a ten-year-long passion project. They're true fans of the ~~original series~~ official release, and it really shows in their work."
Didn't he also headbutt his wife in the face though? Not so cool in my book.
"That's assault, brother."
"The Office, amazing show that can be amazingly funny as well as make you love the characters"
"It's about shelf coverage. the more varieties a brand has, the more of a supermarket shelf they can cover, so the more likely you are to see their brand and buy it."
