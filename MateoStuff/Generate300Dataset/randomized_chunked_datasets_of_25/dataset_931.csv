65914,best college in california,What about the Stanford rejects?
13904,best research paper archive,"""Self-report captures 27 distinct categories of emotion
bridged by continuous gradients"""
42126,movies like Inception,Primer
19021,best YouTube video,"The comment section is golden. I really like all the comments relating to either being so good at lock picking he just has to look at it, or the ones about him breaking into your house and hearing” 1 is binding, click out of two, ...”"
34785,best NFL player,"Tom Brady.  No position matters as much as quarterback and relevancy is a prerequisite for greatness.  No one cares about the most skilled long snapper.  

Statistically he's at or near the top of nearly every category.  And he's lead the greatest dynasty in NFL history."
4802,best home improvement store,"I prefer Lowes on tools and outdoor material, Home Depot on paint and lumber."
37139,best amusement park,"We've had very different experiences at SFMM. I've only been there 3 or 4 times, for a couple days each time, but aside from Apocalypse being down while they built West coast racers, I can't think of any rides being down on my trips."
11940,best gifts for dad,Bottle of bourbon and a few hours of damned silence.
55424,best action and adventure novel series,On the Road by Jack Kerouac
968,best ice cream flavor,"Beat me to it

I think it was recalled for a while though due to people getting sick from the cookie dough"
72153,best movies with a cool twist,"I really enjoyed the twist at the end of Skeleton Key. As someone who watches way too many movies, this one gave me the best, ""wait, what?"" moments in probably a 5 year span."
1039,best ice cream flavor,"Coffee flavored ice cream, but then you pour an espresso on top of it. (this heavenly experience is called an Affogato)

I make them at the airports on long layovers by buying a scoop of icecream, heading down to starbucks and getting a double espresso, then pouring that over my icecream bowl."
68045,best science fiction novel,"I saw it in Waterstones the other day, maybe your local one has a copy?"
44082,best items under $100,"A coworker of mine convinced me to look into buying one. He has two installed. The first one he has both a forward facing camera and a rear facing one. The second one he has installed has it facing towards him from the rearview mirror in the event anyone accuses him of talking on the phone or texting while driving. The second one also captures audio for the same purpose and just as a precautionary. Apparently, they are very easy to install as some just plug into your cig lighter and turn on as soon as the car is started and can take upwards of a 32gb micro SD. Definitely worth the investment."
37214,best amusement park,"i really don’t think it’s a matter of distance. i live in hollywood and the two parks are almost exactly equidistant from me, and, if anything, traffic going south into orange county is much worse. likewise, nearly two million people in the san fernando valley are much closer to magic mountain than knott’s. i really do think it comes down to magic mountain sort of being a shithole (i love it, but it is what it is) and knott’s being well-manicured and lovely. there also were problems with gangs at magic mountain and LA boomers seem to have never forgotten this (it was the first park that had metal detectors in SoCal, and this was a long while before they were installed at other parks)."
11966,best gifts for dad,After a long enough period of time in a marriage there is little choice for the husband...
55522,best action and adventure novel series,"> From most accounts WoT falls victim to some really boring, meandering entries later in the series

Yeah, that's what people like to say, but I've never experienced it that way, and I've followed the series my whole life.  I feel like it's a nitpick that gained popularity as the series came to its widely publicized and anticipated finish, because people always have to find *some* nitpick with anything that becomes popular.

> I've read most of Sanderson's output

Ditto.  I'm a fan of his writing and of his teaching.  Right now I'm doing the online version of his writing class, ""Write About Dragons"".  He has an accessible approach to his process and offers some handy tools."
68375,best science fiction novel,Both of them are very conservative. You can also look at another book they wrote together (Lucifer's Hammer) that was released around the same time to get an understanding of their beliefs.
14492,best romantic novel,You’re in for a treat.  Enjoy!
60325,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Definitely need to. In addition to being genuinely funny, the characters actually grow and change."
7048,best iPhone,If it had an OLED display I'd buy it. That's a feature I absolutely can't live without after being on Android the last couple of years.
64721,Best Nike running shoes,"Two of my favorite running shoes are by Skechers: Gomeb Razor and Ride 7.  They're killing it, lately."
69925,best major to study in college,It's easier to get a job pointing the spotlight than standing in it.
