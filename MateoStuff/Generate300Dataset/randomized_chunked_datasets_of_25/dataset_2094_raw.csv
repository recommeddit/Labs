Spot on. Really enjoyed lunch there recently on a Saturday but it was quite empty. Hope this place makes it!
"Castle --- maybe.  I find myself drawn to it.  I liked it when it was on in broadcast initially.  Now, stuck mostly alone during this pandemic, and teleworking, and putting the tv on in the background to break the dead silence in my apartment or to block out the dork above me constantly banging around with his weightlifting at every hour, but I've run out of stuff.  So Castle is on Lifetime now.

I still enjoy it, but it's so predictable.  And half the episodes almost the same exact method of finding the killer.  They get a picture of the killer searching the traffic cameras, they track his credit card or phone records, they get someone to confess to one of the smaller crimes that was key in the string of events leading up to the murder, but they vehemently deny they murdered anyone.  This person then says ""I want to see a lawyer.""  And Beckett rolls her eyes, like ""ah, shit, I almost had him ready to admit the murder, but he came up with the clever idea to ask for a lawyer.""  But Beckett books him anyway.  Oh, but wait, there is still 12 minutes left.  So they are back to normal life and something happens and Castle stands up straight like he's being shocked and he realizes the clue that they had missed to date but had been right in front of them the whole time.  So they cut to a scene where they go and talk to the actual murderer as if they are just coming to give them an update, then they acuse them, the killer keeps denying, they show them the physical evidence, the killer says ""this is silly, you will never be able to prove it.""  Then, they show their final piece of evidence, and then the killer finally admits it and explains why they had to do it, conveniently laying out all the rest of the info that the prosecutor will need to solidify a conviction.

I doubt that last part ever happens, but I do wonder.  Maybe they do try to lay out their theory to the accused murderer so that the murderer does give up all the details that they have had on their chest since the killing and the cops are hoping they will have a complete confession then... who knows.  But it's funny that no matter what, almost every case follows that exact same pattern on Castle."
"A good shop vac. You will not believe how many uses around the house you'll find for it. Cobweb removal, water removal, gravel removal, vent cleaning, soot trap cleaning, (after a good scrub since it's likely dirty from other tasks) car vacuuming, dust sucking, the list goes on. Seriously if you plan to buy or already own a home go get a shop vac."

"Yes, that one has a much weaker processor, so it is less future proof in my eyes."
Lacoste Essential and Armani Code. I also use Fierce and Burberry.
"I swear to god, I'm not singling you out or anything but every single person that talks about Marriott talks about its consistency and always mentions something along the lines of ""its never disappointed me.""  This is the 3rd time now, if I was more paranoid I'd cry that it's a corporate shill, but I'm content to say that it's just a weird coincidence.  Marriott has some diehard fans."

"Hint.   Use the Target app before you go to see if they have what you are looking for in the store.  Target is pretty good about keeping inventory up to date.  

Walmart app for the stores in my town is pretty worthless."

"So under rated! Proof Matthew mccaunagey can act his ass off! This and ""a time to kill"" make up for all the ""failure to launch"" BS. And Bill Paxton is great in it too!"
"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - really great movie

Forbidden Planet is an old movie but is quite good


Not a fan of it, but Sphere with Dustin Hoffman fits your request.

"Newfound Gap to Fontana Dam or Iron Mt Gap to 19E (goes over Roan Highlands) are both hikes which can be done in two or three nights.  Would need transport for both ends as not loops but if you do not have two cars, shuttle services are out there.  Both are on the AT and I think the Smokies you need to reserve shelter spots in advance or did when I did it a few years ago.  Both fun hikes.  Boone, NC is near Roan Highlands and a cool town.  Grandfather Mt is nearby and cool too.  Smokies has so much stuff in it and nearby.  Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Dragons Trail near Fontana Dam, Dollywood, etc."
