"IMO UL2 is one of the best looking mouse out there, off-white looks very good and I kinda like the orange too. I dislike majority of  the ""gAmINg"" mice out there due RGB and ugly-ass logos. It feels like the whole PC gaming industry is around RGB and gAmING GamING gaAMiNG... I'd rather see minimalistic designs combined with premium materials."
"It was a war of opportunity. The US wanted the land which is taught within the scope of manifest destiny and how it fit within those concepts and goals. Basically manifest destiny was just the belief that the US needed to span the whole width of the continent top to bottom. It was our destiny to do so. Those territories were right in the way. MÃ©xico couldnâ€™t really control the area either. 

Then the casus belli presented itself and the US took advantage of the opportunity. Pretty straightforward."

"Vivaldi is still based on Chromium. 

The issues you've mentioned use to exist with previous versions of Firefox, but they've been fixed. There are websites and even videos benchmarking the performance of multiple browsers and Firefox has shown to be the most ""complete"" and most efficient among the most known ones. (There are obviously less known browsers that are incredibly light but also have fewer features and capabilities) 

DYOR!"
">Alexander built an empire to rival Persia in 13 years, starting at age 20.

I'm 37, and I haven't built an empire at *all*. Now I feel pretty lazy."
"Paris Texas - Boy Anonymous or Van Buren Records - Bad for Press.

Both of these artists Iâ€™ve been high on since they dropped singles for these albums. Very excited to see Paris Texas grab traction now touring with Brockhampton, but donâ€™t really understand how Van Buren Records has been so overlooked. Their grungy vibe with trading off verses reminds me so much of HEAT or STAR from Brockhampton. I havenâ€™t really seen anyone check them out and highly suggest people do, as their album is one of my favorites this year"

"I have an iPhone SE 128GBâ€¦ not the newer version of SEâ€™s, the old one. My buddy found it in a box while moving last year and sent it to me. I reset it and Iâ€™ve had 0 problems with it. Running the newest OS as well."

"Love sick (used to be titled scrotal recall) is on Netflix and has 3 seasons. 30 min episodes set in the UK

Overall story is that the lead is diagnosed with chlamydia and needs to contact his old partners. Each episode is a flash back to their relationship. Very funny heartwarming comedy."

"I updated it just after I commented it.

Sadly with wireless there is no best of the worst. It's just some to 1 thing well and everything else bad.

Gsp670, no simultaneously Bluetooth but good sound and build. Not great connection, not great comfort, bad mic. Overpriced. 

Arctis pro wireless, good features, good connection, not very good audio, bad mic, poor build, bad comfort unless you have small ears and a small head, poor durability. Very overpriced.

That's kinda the story for them all."

"The self checkout machine at Lowes shorted me 3 dollars on a 10 dollar cash back. I didn't touch the money and called the attendant. She called a manager who proceeded to say that since she wasn't there and didn't see it happen she couldn't do anything. I said that was fine and I'll just grab a soda and call it even only to be told I couldn't take it without paying.

How was I not paying? The till had my money in there. She said to leave my number and they'd call me at the end of the day after they counted the cash.By that point I had already been standing there taking up a spot with a growing line so I just decided to take my L and walk away. There was no point in continuing to press the issue over 3 dollars otherwise I'd get more upset and stew in it all day.

As an employee I can understand where she was coming from but as a customer I wanted to throw the 7 dollars it did give me in her face because she kept giving me this look like I was trying to pull some kind of scam."
