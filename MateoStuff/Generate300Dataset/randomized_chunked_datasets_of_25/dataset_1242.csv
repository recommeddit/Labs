582,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"You are right of course. Generally i can max out my 200/20 line with Air, the servers in Sweden are the only ones that go a bit out of line compared to the others. On a bad day i can barely squeeze 30 - 40 MBit out of them. It's a bit weird, i know, and i am certainly complaining on a very high level. Maybe there is a bad routing from Uppsala / Sweden to my place, who knows..."

73223,best Linux distro,"Linux Mint, Kubuntu, or really anything with a Cinnamon or KDE Plasma desktop will give you enough of a Windows-like experience to get started.

I recommend Plasma personally; it can be configured in pretty much any way imaginable, whether you want it to look like Windows (taskbar and desktop icons), macOS (app dock at the bottom with a full screen app dashboard and always-on top bar), or some other custom layout."

16676,best pet for toddlers,"I am so sorry the cat ran away. I seriously hope it wasn't hit by a car. :(

And not all cats are Houdinis...IMO (and keep in mind this is strictly my opinion so take it as you will) they're less likely to want to get out if they've been fixed (you didn't say whether yours was or not) and if they've ever only been indoor cats. If they've been indoor/outdoor cats they are GOING to want to get out because that's what they're used to.

I wouldn't, at least for the time being, get her a new pet just because the old one MIGHT have died. You don't know for sure and honestly,your attitude is a bit worrisome. ""Oh the cat is *probably* dead..let's go get a new pet RIGHT NOW sweetie!"" screams to me that you treat your pets less as family members and more of a cute but somewhat annoying fashion accessory. :("
1198,best ice cream flavor,Red bean because yes.
15190,best tree for the garden,"Dogwoods can be super fickle especially the pink variety and be super careful when planting Japanese maples as they will destroy your pipes. Both are beautiful but can be difficult. Bradford pears are beautiful, ornamental,  flowering in the spring. They have  no fruit to deal with. Easy to maintain and grow quickly as to make a nice shade tree. They grow in a nice shape also."
