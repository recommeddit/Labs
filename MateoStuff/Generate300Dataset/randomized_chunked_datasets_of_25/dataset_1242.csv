16676,"I am so sorry the cat ran away. I seriously hope it wasn't hit by a car. :(

And not all cats are Houdinis...IMO (and keep in mind this is strictly my opinion so take it as you will) they're less likely to want to get out if they've been fixed (you didn't say whether yours was or not) and if they've ever only been indoor cats. If they've been indoor/outdoor cats they are GOING to want to get out because that's what they're used to.

I wouldn't, at least for the time being, get her a new pet just because the old one MIGHT have died. You don't know for sure and honestly,your attitude is a bit worrisome.
