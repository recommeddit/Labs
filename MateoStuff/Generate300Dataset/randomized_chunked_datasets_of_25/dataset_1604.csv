73841,best matte screen protector for ipad,What do you mean by frosting the screen?
42388,movies like Inception,"By mental movies do you mean.. ones that make you think? Or ones that ultimately try to throw you for a loop? Movies like Children of Men.. Minority Report.. Gattaca.. fall into the former category but not the latter. As a genre I'd call them ""smart"" sci-fi.

The latter category I'd call the ol' ""mindfuck"" genre. And I'd really recommend Pi if you haven't seen it. Also The Fountain, Daranofsky as well. And Fight Club which I imagine you've seen because I think everyone has. And Memento which is probably better than every movie I've mentioned thus far.

Edit: Oh and the Prestige. Another Chris Nolan film (Inception, and Memento)."
47910,best color to paint with,I love the chopping block counter!!
12649,best gifts for mom,I'm a first-time mom of a 3 month old daughter and I'm now crying at my desk. I haven't even experienced most of these things yet and I'm already sad about losing them one day.
70206,best major to study in college,"Neuroscience major. I want to get a PhD after school so I can go into research, as opposed to an MD like many of my classmates. I'm going to be paying roughly the same student debt as the guy becoming a doctor. The thing is, while he makes a nice, 6-figure salary, I'm probably going to be making ~40-50 K for a very long time. Sometimes I get really iffy about the academic life."
53175,best hiphop album,"Me. Real hip hop. Rock with me!

55647,best action and adventure novel series,"I didn't think Consider Phlebas was a space opera at all. I thought it was more like Indiana Jones in space. But I'm not even sure what a space opera actually is, so whatever.

I have read Hydrogen Sonata as well. In the beginning I found it so boring that I almost put it down but you are right, when they start shooting, the action is really awesome."
49449,best gaming monitor,"I bought [this one](https://www.synthesizerguide.com/viotek/) off of amazon and I personally love it - haven't had any complaints. The monitor build looks nice. It has a plastic body and is sturdy enough. The curve is simple and not overdone. The buttons for settings are underneath on the bottom right side and are pretty easy to work with. It has a blue power led that points straight down and reflects on the table surface.

&#x200B;

I'm using it with the Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 8GB."
37994,best Marvel movie,"No other MCU movie has left me with the same ""holy fuck what an intelligent movie"" impression. It has something to say not just about heroism, but it has a topical message about a serious problem in our real-world society. Winter Soldier is the movie that made me really fall in love with Cap."
6319,best Netflix documentary,It's a great documentary but I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. It's just so heartbreaking.
22906,best celebrity,YES. YES HE FUCKING DID I LOVE YOU FOR ASKING THAT BECAUSE NO ONE BELIEVES ME.
35995,best alcoholic drink,Going to upvote this in the hope that it's sarcasm!
30326,best Mexican war to study,"Can I recommend the book [war without garlands](http://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Without-Garlands-Operation-Barbarossa/dp/0711033242/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281111966&sr=8-1). It presents the invasion in a very good way taking into account mainly the german perspective but also the russian views before invasion and during it, up until moscow 1941. It is extremely eye opening especially the chapter named after the title which puts into perspective the reasons soldiers did what they did and why both sides fought for dear life. I am fascinated with the eastern front and have read many german memoirs of that period, I enjoy learning about the german army and the war in russia. Can I point out that it is easy to look back and see what the germans did wrong, what the russians did right, but at that point in time the initial operation barbarossa plans were pretty damn good going on the previous invasions. What germany nor the rest of the world expected was how hard the russians would fight! In previous battles once the poles, brits, french were encircled they gave up but the russians fought senseless break out attacks and annihilated themselves but slowly wore down the german divisions teeth. The germans were Victored to Death."
70552,best major to study in college,Fair enough. Thanks!
19221,best YouTube video,A man has a ferret that has babies and she wants his hand in the box with them. When he takes his hand away she runs after it and takes his hand back. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcCRZkeqFY8&list=LL-K93ZVfbGSLN2nZKaPkjVw&index=62&ab_channel=RMVideos)

56546,best desktop monitor,"Is this part from the archived guide still true? 

>	1080p 144Hz AHVA/IPS/PLS do not exist

I'm looking into getting a 1080p ips or VA with freesync. If 144Hz panels of that size/resolution are made, what's the highest refresh rates offered on that combo: 75Hz?"
51320,best iphone case,"I’ve been using Spigen since the 6S (I think), so I’ve decided to continue the tradition due to having no issues.

I’ve also gone for the Ultra Hybrid, but the one without the MagSafe circle on the back (I can’t stand it…it just looks like a bad sticker), as it’s still MagSafe compatible and half the price (in the U.K.)."
36661,best alcoholic drink,The vermouth used in a Manhattan is sweet.
17521,best iOS game,Star Wars Force Arena. A star wars take on Clash Royal but with added control of your leading Unit One of the best competitive games I played on mobile with a fair and nice monetization model to where they just give you pretty much everything. Sadly the game was shut down a while back. F
44161,best items under $100,"Less that $100? For a year? Where is that, and how shitty is the gym?"
31346,best country to live in,"Yeah, with the States it seems to me that it's almost a matter of finding at enclave like New York or Austin or SF or the Pacific Northwest where you can try to ignore the machinations of the rest of the country.

Craft is really the deal killer though. I'm working on my East Coast palette, but I'm mostly a West Coast person when it comes to ales and my knowledge of Belgians is pretty much nonexistent. So hard to get good stuff in most places.

That said, I could see myself living part of the time in Brussels and part of the time somewhere further south. And also part of the time somewhere chill like Boulder or the Bay or PNW.

Haha, guess I forgot we're not in /r/beer or /r/Europe."
55356,best action and adventure novel series,To this I would also add CS Forester's Horatio Hornblower series and Patrick O'Brians Aubrey–Maturin series and you'd about have the nautical realm covered.
