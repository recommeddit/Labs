42388,"By mental movies do you mean.. ones that make you think? Or ones that ultimately try to throw you for a loop? Movies like Children of Men.. Minority Report.. Gattaca.. fall into the former category but not the latter. As a genre I'd call them ""smart"" sci-fi.

The latter category I'd call the ol' ""mindfuck"" genre. And I'd really recommend Pi if you haven't seen it. Also The Fountain, Daranofsky as well. And Fight Club which I imagine you've seen because I think everyone has. And Memento which is probably better than every movie I've mentioned thus far.

Edit: Oh and the Prestige. Another Chris Nolan film (Inception, and Memento).",movies like Inception

49449,"I bought [this one](https://www.synthesizerguide.com/viotek/) off of amazon and I personally love it - haven't had any complaints. The monitor build looks nice. It has a plastic body and is sturdy enough. The curve is simple and not overdone. The buttons for settings are underneath on the bottom right side and are pretty easy to work with. It has a blue power led that points straight down and reflects on the table surface.

It presents the invasion in a very good way taking into account mainly the german perspective but also the russian views before invasion and during it, up until moscow 1941. It is extremely eye opening especially the chapter named after the title which puts into perspective the reasons soldiers did what they did and why both sides fought for dear life. I am fascinated with the eastern front and have read many german memoirs of that period, I enjoy learning about the german army and the war in russia. Can I point out that it is easy to look back and see what the germans did wrong, what the russians did right, but at that point in time the initial operation barbarossa plans were pretty damn good going on the previous invasions. What germany nor the rest of the world expected was how hard the russians would fight! In previous battles once the poles, brits, french were encircled they gave up but the russians fought senseless break out attacks and annihilated themselves but slowly wore down the german divisions teeth. The germans were Victored to Death.",best Mexican war to study

Craft is really the deal killer though. I'm working on my East Coast palette, but I'm mostly a West Coast person when it comes to ales and my knowledge of Belgians is pretty much nonexistent. So hard to get good stuff in most places.
