I came here to make sure someone mentioned these. :-) I love these stories. Great fantasy adventures.
Not to mention the world's deepest slot canyon.
"I would probably have to disagree, as an FT resident... DLG at least is still way better imo. The salad bar situation at Portola has a lot of gross limp vegetables, and their vegetarian options aren’t as good at the other dining commons. 
        
That being said it’s not bad st all. But I always enjoy going to Carillo more than I do going to Portola. They also have a weird thing going on with the serving size there."
"Hutchinson KS is a small city northwest of Wichita that has two exceptional attractions: the [Cosmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmosphere), a superb space museum; and [Strataca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strataca), a massive underground salt mine."

"Kingsoft office, also known as WPS office. Ui is very similar. I use it for almost 3 years and never had a problem"

"Modern medicine and aerospace engineering wouldn't be possible without CS, for example.

You're right that he should define *useful* but you certainly didn't do a good job defining it."
"You'll be able to do all of those things.

No one is going to pry your cars out of your hands, and it looks like you can afford a little more tax to pay for your hobbies. Which is fair, given the costs."
"No, mine feels fine. I also like the open bottom portion as, when you swipe up, there's no bump across bottom and you thumb glides right up the iPhone smoothly."
"Actually that depends. Some colleges, such as embry riddle, offer degrees online but their diploma and transcripts say worldwide campus distance Ed"
"At least link his youtube channel... Jeez

Aaaaand now I'm crying tears of joy."
Fantastic team. They never won anything in Europe though.
Does the first work as a stand-alone?
"I have the very same experience with vomero, except I run in the 9 instead of 8"
"My wife says ""Eww, David"" every time I do something weird. My name is not David, but I always respond with ""Bébé..."" in return. So many great performances in Schitt's Creek."
"Zebra is by far my favourite. The customizations and speed are great for what I need. Cydia is still OG, but lacking some features in my opinion."
"Most universities are nationally accredited. Which doesn't really mean much. It's REGIONAL accreditation you want to look for. It means much more than national accreditation, and also means most (undergrad) credits will transfer. Credits from specialty schools - such as Full Sail - won't transfer into another school's bachelor degree programs. That means if you spend $80k+ on their recording or film program, you end up having to do all your general classes over if you want a career change later on."
