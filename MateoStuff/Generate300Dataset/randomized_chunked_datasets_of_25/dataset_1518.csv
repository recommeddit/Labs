12834,"Kids generally go through three stages of interest/like with their parents.

1. As children. They'll love you to pieces and show it.

2. As teenagers. They'll ignore, dislike, and generally treat you pretty callously. Teenagers do this to most people in general, so you're not getting special treatment here really.

3. As adults. Assuming you're not a monster(Some parents are. Just adding the disclaimer for accuracy.), they'll start being far more thoughtful and considerate of you again, and more open about their love for you.",best gifts for mom

47077,"If you head to Colorado, head for Boulder. It is literally nestled against the side of the mountains, and although at times there's a bit of a yuppy/hipster vibe, It is one of the most beautiful places ever. Also If your into outdoor activities it has pretty much anything you could want. Snowboarding, skiing, snowmobiling all within an hour of town. in the summer and most other times of the year you can go hiking,  biking, rock climbing, canoeing, tubing, rafting(some of these are a little further up in the mountains, but finding a carpool is really easy.

They've also got something like 10 breweries within the city limits. I don't know how they compare to European beers, but they're better than any coors or bud beers.

If you don't know anyone around there I would suggest you get a hotel room in Broomfield or Longmont which are both right outside of Boulder. It'll be a bit cheaper and the public transportation system is good enough to get you anywhere.

Last note, it is a college town so there is a huge population of early to mid-twenty-somethings. Depending on what your into this could be great, or not so great. If you head there during the summer time it can be much quieter as a lot of the students are gone.

61695,"Witcher 3. Essentially regarded in many lists as best RPG of the generation to date. 

Old, but really fun RPG in the zombie genre is Dying Light.

The Farcry series are shooter RPGs.

Diablo 3

Tomb raider series

Uncharted series

Divinity Original Sin series are absolutely amazing. In my top 3 of the generation.

Dragon age inquisition 

Kingdom Come

Pillars of Eternity 1 and Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. perhaps one of the most underrated RPGs in the generation.
