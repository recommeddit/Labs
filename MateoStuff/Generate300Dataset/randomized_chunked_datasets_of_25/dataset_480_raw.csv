I live on the 28th floor but have a good sized balcony so I have my hammock up out there most days and even tho it is too cold now 80% of the year you can find me out there after work reading or smoking and watching the city!
That sounds fantastic.  Her recipes get mentioned here a lot.
"Can also vouch for Wenger. Found them cheaper than Swiss and have used mine for traveling and school, still looking great. 

Edit: English"
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Today its really cliche and its parodied all the time but when it came out it blew everyones mind.
"mckinley dixon - for my mama and anyone who look like her

"Actually, this question comes up pretty often so it's quite easy to find a lot of aggregated suggestions. A few months ago I picked up 4-5 of those threads and wrote down the titles that came up more often. Just search for ""suggestions"" or something like that.

It might take longer and be less practical than the r/fantasy list, but it could give you a bit more insight about what people like about those books."
"I went there, and it requires me to sign up with supreme blaze, which costs a ton of money. Am I doing anything wrong?"
"Star Wars...nothing comes close.

I never realized before that all the main characters in episode 4 are introduced on/around Tatooine."
"I have a [Brenthaven](http://www.brenthaven.com/) backpack.  I got my first one around 2004, and I tore a small hole in it around 2010.  I called them up an they told me to go on their website and pick out a new one. They sent it to me for free (a $180 backpack!), and only asked that I use the enclosed label to send them back my old one.

I love their products. They are serious about their lifetime warranty."
Really I just got one from JCrew many years ago that I love. Some kind of special wash cotton. Can't find anything like it.

"It's a link to the 1972 listing on IMDB. (Maybe that doesn't show up in whatever way yer viewing the comment)

Didn't care for the Soderbergh version, but I probably will watch it again at some point."
"It's definitely in my top 5, I even enjoy it way more than GKMC (and I looooooove GKMC)."
"I looked for lists that seemed to be made by knowledgeable anime fans, and had a good amount of variety.  I avoided lists that focused too heavily on a single genre or a single decade.

I found both of those lists, but I decided not to use them.  The JW list looks very shounen-heavy, and it only includes anime that are available to stream.  The NHK list looks like there may have been some vote-stuffing."
I did this with my (old) SE for about $80 and it still works great!
I appear to be a pleb
"How is Serbia so high, even higher than last world cup's second place.

I'm honestly curious i recognize Bosnian and Croatian players but no Serbians unless i'm forgetting people."
Just commenting on this in case I need it
Vodka.  It goes with everything.

I personally dont like any of these distros but Linux Mint is the best out of the three
"Only one book released after 1985 on that list though. I'd add something by China Mieville, Dan Simmons or Neil Gaiman."
"I use nnn to navigate and then use separate utilities (find, mv, cp, etc) for other functions."
Big B. I grew up watching his movies. I still enjoy watching his better films when I can.
