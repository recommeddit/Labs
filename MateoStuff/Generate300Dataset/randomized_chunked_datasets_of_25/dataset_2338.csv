Otherwise, take whatever sweet soft drink you want and dump a bunch of vodka in it, that ought to do the trick.  Some dark/spiced rums are sweet enough that you can mix them strong and hardly notice.  Kracken is like that and so is Diplomatico.  Half and half with a dark soda and it won't taste much different from the soda itself.

Also, not a mixed drink and doesn't really fit the mood at a ""drink to get drunk"" party, but some wine can be very, very sweet/not taste alcoholic, and if you drink it quick it'll hit you wayyyy harder than 13-15% ABV logically should."
