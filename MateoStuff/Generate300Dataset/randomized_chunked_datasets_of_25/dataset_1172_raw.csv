"I have used the magnetic USB c/micro USB charging cables for years. The ones that plug into the bottom of the phone and connect magnetically like the old magsafe charger on Macs.


I'd generally agree with this statement, though. The wall chargers are horrific, so I can imagine the cables are also bad."
You talking about Rule 3? You can share top level links to general requests.
Thanks for the suggestion!
"I've re-watched it a few times now too, each time I hear some new lyric I'd previously missed that makes me laugh.  For a topic so corporate on its surface it is wonderfully heartwarming."

"I think these mixed college rankings are misguided. Any ranking will make subjective judgement of what makes a college ""good"". Popular rankings give methodologies from which you can figure out what they value in colleges. If you combine multiple rankings, you lose clarity on what the ranking considers ""good"". It makes it hard (or impossible) to know what it means for a college to be above another college in the ranking. 

If you make a ranking, you should say exactly what metrics go into the ranking. I doubt you can do that here."
It depends on the configuration and price.
"*War of the Ring*

Because it's a great experience. It's only 1vs1 but it creates a story to be told. 

*Castles of Burgundy*

A modern classic that relaxes you and doesn't require much effort to explain nor to play it. 

*LotR LCG*

A challenging coop with wonderful artworks and many different scenarios."
"Did one in high school cause it gave my mom an insurance break (I was already a good/safe driver, so it wasn't for that). It was a ton of fun. The one in my city used old cop cars so you got to swerve around in a police cruiser for a day."
Western genre basically have action and great narrative. John Ford and Sergio Leone are known for developing art house Westerns that blends in great narrative and action. Then we have George Miller’s Mad Max films which combines the artsy stuff and action. I believe Stallone’s First Blood part 1 was basically a art house action film.
"> Classical strings dont have any note indicators or frets which leads to the problem you mentioned above. The layout of these instruments is much friendlier though.

You make it sound like they're easier than guitar!  

Firstly, the question of the ""layout"" is debatable - I'd say the frets make guitar easier, although the mixed tuning (4ths and one 3rd) gets confusing for patterns.   
But the main thing with classical strings is the *bowing*.  That's a lot harder to learn just hitting the strings with your fingers (or a pick).   Violin in particular sounds terrible while you're learning - a combination of poor intonation and clumsy bowing - while guitar's frets mean at least you can play in tune (if not in key...).

There's also an argument for guitar that its fretboard is a better guide for how intervals and scales work (up one string) than a keyboard, with its misleading white-black distinctions.  Otherwise, piano is obviously a lot easier technically; and bigger range and better for theory.  (And the white-black distinction is at least historically informative, as well as perfectly suited to staff notation.)


Excellent summary otherwise. :-)"
Nobody ever steals from my Walmart grocery sacks. Checkmate.
"A few reasons:

1. AUR
2. Steam out of the box.
3. Most stable version of KDE I have ever used.  And thats a big win since KDE is my favorite DE.
4. I don't have to install Arch linux."
Yeah I think I'll avoid this one.  Thanks for the recommendation though.

"but wouldn't not having any of them be better because they all suck?
The cell carriers are the same, they all suck, they all lie, they all over charge & under deliver."
"Absolutely love these with 70g gold springs!! Omg they are beautiful!! 

If you like box navies then zealios will almost feel linear to you(in comparison) They are so smooth but not nearly the tactility of royals, hako royals or even navies."
"Nice write up!  To clarify on your El Sitio, are you talking the one on Calle Real behind 7-11 up on the 7300 block?  Or the one on Fairview which isn't far from Calle Real but just across the freeway?

I think they're both good, but tend to go to Fairview El Sitio as it's a little closer to where I live now."
Ranger.. I tried Thunar and came straight back to Ranger.

"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

Bloodborne 

Child of Light 

Bastion/Transistor/Pyre by Supergiant  - Cheating, but hard to choose out of the three.

I don't consider Horizon Zero Dawn an rpg hence it's exclusion from my list."
