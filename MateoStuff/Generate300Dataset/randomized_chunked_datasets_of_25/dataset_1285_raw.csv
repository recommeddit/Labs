"Defunctland.

Does detailed and super interesting videos on defunct theme park attractions, as well as former TV shows. They just did an episode on Between the Lions."
And he's from Texas
Thanks for putting this together! Fascinating to see where my picks rank compared to other reviewers. And to see that I'm not totally insane for some of my choices.
"roads are shit. it has to do with the materials used, which IIRC are the worst in the nation. combine that with lots of snow and then lots of salting they deteriorate faster than they could be patched. Also, Economy still hasn't recovered entirely from 2008"
"Joe Rogan is the antithesis of this thread. after a show he sticks around for hours signing everything and taking pictures with everyone. EVERYONE. also, it's not uncommon for him to tip someone $1,000."
"I‚Äôve jumped on the Brave train. Privacy, ad control, and built on Chromium so things don‚Äôt break like on Safari and Firefox. The compatibility of Chrome with a future-facing approach to privacy with its own tokenized reward system. Bookmark management is not the best, but everything else has been solid."

I actually really love dual POV üò≥ so I might really enjoy One Day in December and On the Island

Vanilla is made for ice cream. Chocolate tastes like you're trying to down some tar.
"Linguistics: the best thing is how many other cultures I‚Äôve gotten to experience, the worst thing is that it‚Äôs such a broad field of study that just because someone else is studying ‚Äúlinguistics,‚Äù they could have a vastly different focus and skill set."
"For $100 more you can get the legion 5 with the better GPU.

"Whatever you do, do NOT put razorblades in any of the food stuffs. In fact, for the peace of mind of the parents, only give out stuff which is sealed in one form or another.

If kids say ""Trick or Treat"", they're asking for a trick or a treat. When you run out of treats, it's time to give them tricks. Hide in the bushes with a garden hose and douse them down real good (relevant [Calvin & Hobbes](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/10/31))"
I think we found the politician!
"and if by ""hours"" you mean ""I might occasionally take 10sec to glance at a `man`-page to check the syntax of a particular option I don't use frequently"" I guess so. But with lots experience (this is r/commandline after all), none of those tasks tend to take me more than a couple minutes total to compose, test, and execute‚Äîsomething that takes far longer most of the time in any of the file-managers I've tried."
I 100% recommend Skydive CA. Community is great and they're also safety-minded.
"Buddliea grow quickly, have a good spread and get fairly tall. They grow anywhere and butterflies love them.

Or, try a Leylandii. Again they grow bush well and grow quite quickly. They can get very tall, so will need trimming every year."
Icarus and don‚Äôt Fuck with cats are sooo good
as a Syracuse native... this happens far too often
"Among those that I have watched, Manoj Bajpai in Gow impressed me most.
After it Nawazuddin in Raman Raghav 2.0 was really great."
At least it's a fairly short watch as far as movies go.
"I enjoy Old Spice, but honestly my favorite fragrance is soap.  For the love of god if you just shower regularly you won't have to douse yourself in silly fragrances."
"Nice guy, good buns."
