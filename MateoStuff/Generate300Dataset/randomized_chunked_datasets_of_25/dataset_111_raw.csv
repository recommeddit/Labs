"Yeah, the symbiote makes you the best it can, including being the coolest. It's not its fault that Peter's idea of cool is so lame"
"I don't agree with that sentiment. Even with the same factions, the starting positions, up to 4 maps (randomly seeded) and hell, what you draw (and from which deck) will keep me entertained for good while."
"I learned react with Brad Traversy.
He is more fast paced than Muller or Schwartz
Really helped me get a job a year ago"
"When employers are searching for a web dev, do they also expect you to know about back end programming, or do they hire someone else for that?"
"full disclosure: i’ve eaten these but i’ve never made them, i’m just a fan who likes to appreciate all y’all’s creativity

1-  goat cheese, fig, and honey- creamy, slightly salty, but sweet. like if cheesecake were part of the base but not actually mixed in as chunks, plus fig jam and honey swirled in. had this in seville spain

2-  creme caramel almond crunch - if you’ve seen the movie “up”, it features an ice cream shop based in the suburbs of san francisco and it’s real and has delicious ice cream.  swirls of buttery creme caramel and crunchy almond toffee in a vanilla base. 

3- pistachio. i had  the most delicious, rich, flavorful pistachio gelato in sienna italy. the pistachio flavor was so pronounced and yet the gelato was only slightly green. i can imagine it had to have pistachio butter as part of the base, aside from maybe oils? 

these are the flavors i want all the other flavors to taste like."
"You can take a look at this list:

"I think a lot of people forget how huge the first one was at the box office. $400 million box office, over $100 million opening weekend. 16 years ago, when super hero movies were 99% guaranteed trash."
It's kind of depressing that just about every movie on this list is like 30 years old.  Is this really a genre that Hollywood just can't do (well) anymore?

The 2721DGF is basically the same panel as the GL850 but with better qc.
Seconded for this monitor. Had it since April and I absolutely love it.

But I love every album front to back. It's always hard to put any of the albums low on the list, but the top ones are easy"

Otherwise, great info across Nike's 2016 line up."
"It’s a whole range of unskilled, skilled and professionals leaving NZ for Australia.  Australia is the 13th largest economy in the world with a population of 24M.  NZ is the 53rd largest economy in the world with a population of 4.7M. The average living standard in NZ is not as high as outsiders think.  People should be circumspect when considering moving there. It’s a nice place, but that’s not enough for tens of thousands on NZers who leave for Australia every year."
"Absolutley! I felt similar, I ""knew"" about the treatment of orcas in captivity,  but it is way deeper than that. Truly jarring at times!"
I loved Oceans Twelve’s twist simply because the twist makes the second half of the film completely irrelevant and they’re only doing it to put on a show.
Well no matter how many  “haha Kentucky is racist” lines there are theres no denying the glory of Swedish Fish
"Depends on the store. Of the three nearby hd's, one is incredible for staff knowledge and availability, the other two are a complete disaster. Lowes has some nicer finish options, but their store network isn't laid out as conveniently for me. I also find their staff sort of suck in the nearby locations.  Hd seems to hire retired tradesmen and lowes seems to hire high school students."
