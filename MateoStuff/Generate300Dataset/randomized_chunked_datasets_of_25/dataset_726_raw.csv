"IMO Gilchrist and Warne mustve made a real difference to Australia, A keeper who averaged 50 for most of his career and a world class spinner that Windies Never had. Its hard to compare players/teams that played in different times, but IMO Waugh's australia just nips LLyod's windies."
I believe in TTGL supremacy. Overall pretty interesting seeing how tastes change over time.
"I’m buying a house that’s completely painted a really dark beige (no thank you) so I’ve been looking into this a lot! I’m seeing a lot of really light greens and grayish greens heavily featured in 2019 paint brochures. 

I actually decided to go with ‘White Dove’ by Benjamin Moore. I like it because a creamy white that’ll go with both warm and cool tones depending how you decorate, but isn’t a stark, bright white. The window frames in the new house are actually black, as are the kitchen cabinets and counters, so I think it’ll create a clean, modern look."

"Connections.

You don't have to start with oodles of cash - but you have to have them to get in your position. That's where your friends come in. They introduce you to their friends, who know a guy who owns a business. You promise him you'll keep their interests at heart and...boom! Money. Not to mention a few strings attached.

Soon, you'll meet real politicians. If you're a young up and comer, maybe you'll woo them enough to really back you - a ""fresh"" face to the staunch party lines is always great. They'll vouch for you when they can, hide your mistakes, forgive your shortcomings. There's another string attached. 

Finally, you need to connect with your voters because it's almost reelection time. Your term is only 2 years but hey, in 18 months you're going to have to convince those connections that you've done everything you can to help them out. Better get out and meet new people again!"

Tom Hanks - Class Act

Seal - Kind of a dick

Matt Damon - Quiet but polite

Will Smith - Awesome and always “on” 

Jaden Smith - just like his dad

Jason Mamoa - Sweetheart

Ray Liotta - Definitely a character but super cool

Michael J Fox - Sweetheart

James Corden - dick

Britney Spears - I think we caught her in a rough time

Kardashians - exactly what you’d imagine

Tobey McGuire - Quiet but cool"
