If i had the money to buy all 3 i would say they're all the best and they all have their strengths and weaknesses
Definitely Browns for the best of both worlds.
Agreed. My pick was B2W2
"I like JEdit on Windows. On Linux, where do I even begin? Bluefish for HTML, GEdit for notes and such, Vim for anything from the terminal..."
"NYC is def not outdoorsy.  People I know who live in LA and SF ""go hiking"" on the weekend and stuff.  Have literally never meant anyone here that does that."
"Damn, big gains by Eclipse!"
"guitar then piano. 

but guitar is definitely first."
"I just spent three months traveling, I'd have to say the best places were Zion in Utah and Glacier in Montana. Zion is great because there are so many other places to go within an 8 hour drive"
What does political science offer?
"You are really better of with Mass effect 1+2. Mass effect 3 wasnt that good btw, not bad though. This new Mass Effect shouldnt even be called Mass Effect"
"Thanks, Stetson! I'm sub'd."
"so far my absolute favorite to use is prism. nice UI, easy on the eyes, and has all of the major billets. they also have a search function to add smaller billets or custom bills. AND IT'S TOTALLY FREE!"
If you don't mind going a bit retro - Midnight Club: LA is backwards compatible

"Jesus easy man, they where a powerhouse in Europe about 40 years ago, only recently getting back into the swing of this , it’s not that audacious to think they are a better European team then united. But yeah he’s wrong"
"The best three papers we learned about in school were the Framingham studies, the study finding estrogen replacement therapy increases risk for breast cancer, and the study linking folate to the prevention of neural tube defects. The first is one where an entire town has participated in the study generation by generation for decades, and has given really useful data that has shaped how America sees ""health"". The second one is remarkable because unforeseen side effects became so prominent so quickly during the study that they had to cancel it early because continuing it would increase risk of morbidity/mortality unacceptable in the researchers' behalf. The third used and absolutely INGENIOUS method of retrospectively questioning mothers about PNV use and confounding for their guilt in losing their babies.
These papers are all great examples of what practice-shaping clinical research is all about."
"Tom Holland because he portrays both Peter Parker and Spider-Man perfectly.

Tobey is a great Peter Parker but, not so much as Spider-Man.

Andrew is fantastic with the quips as Spider-Man but, his portrayal of Peter Parker made him look like douche."
"Don't play me like a fool, cause that ain't cool"

"PSA, **public** universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. 

If you need financial aid, look at private universities.  Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply."

You clearly have not used Vivaldi
"TSA Precheck (AKA TSA Known Traveler). It costs $85, and you have to consent to a background check and get fingered printed BUT in exchange you get 5 years of access to the TSA Precheck lane. No body scanner, no removing your shoes and belt, and you can leave your electronics in your carry on. Plus, the line is usually a lot shorter since not many people seem to take advantage of this program. 

I travel a lot for work and let me tell you, this thing changed my LIFE. So much faster, so much easier. I was running late last week and I literally only made it to my flight in time because I got to skip the regular security line. I highly recommend it to anyone in the US who flies at least once a year."
