27737,best bollywood actor,"I thoroughly agree with OP’s point about Haider. Goddamn amazing. Since we’re on the topic of Vishal Bharadwaj, he really draws fantastic performances out of his actors and actresses. Saif in Omkara was magnificent, and Tabu in Haider and Maqbool was amazing."

55540,best action and adventure novel series,"It's amazing, but also *dark*. Very different from Lord of the Rings in that regard. When I'd finished it I actually went out of my way to read something *happy* soon after. But then I'm a humongous wussie."

43085,best detective show,i thought the mentalist was pretty good but you have to be pretty observational like jane was.

7735,best laptop for general use,"Hi, when it comes to single-core performance, the i7-1165G7 is quite a bit better, but realistically, it isn't going to make a big difference for general use. If you can work with a 13"" display and wait for it to drop back down to $999, it is a way better value because you get a stronger CPU, more RAM, and more storage."
60181,best freezer brand,"I'm an appliance tech, and i can echo some of the same sentiments: avoid Samsung, LG, Kenmore, GE and Frigidaire like the plague. JennAir, Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Amana, and Maytag is the way to go"

591,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"Got Nord a few months back, was recommended to me as a good app for Android but I mostly use it on my desktop. I got my CC details leaked and now am extremely paranoid so I'm using an Internet kill switch, which means you can only access the Internet when using the VPN. I think it can be applied to torrenting as well"

6321,best Netflix documentary,"I’m crazy about documentaries, I’ve watched pretty much all of them, and I have to say NONE has stuck with me as much as Dear Zachary. The storytelling is the most fucking raw shit I’ve ever experienced, talk about being taken on a ride. And I also have only been able to bring myself to watch it once. *that* moment that happens, dang.... I have never felt second hand anger so strongly"
68387,best science fiction novel,">*The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass... when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you've just been discovered, you're all subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.*"

3701,best college for research,"While I agree with you in general, there are some pretty solid indicators for research scores that allow for a relatively unbiased view.

Although good for nothing else, this map shows how far the integration of non English speaking countries into the Anglo-Saxon academic world has come if only because these locations are included in this list.
