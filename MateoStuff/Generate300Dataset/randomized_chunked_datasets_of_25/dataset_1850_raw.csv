It can do all the features you just listed with add ons
"Eclidus, Skiing Yeti Mountain, and Downwell"
I get so much use out of mine - it's super versatile and always makes me smile.
Further is one of my favorite albums. Horse power is a little weak but the rest is stellar
how much does a degree from U of P cost?
Why no one talks about Asus TUF VG27AQL1A ? That's the updated version and is competitive with LG head to head.
"Paprika. Clearly the inspiration for Inception, there are even some scenes that are almost identical."
"Itâ€™s not outlandish but thereâ€™s so many guys you could make arguments for. Rice has stats, but you have guys like Jim Brown, Deion Sanders, Lawrence Taylor, even the QBâ€™s. This sub likes to throw around this idea that itâ€™s clearly Rice, and I think thatâ€™s very reductive. Between a LB, WR, QB, CB and an RB the most dependent position is easily WR.

Edit: lol I like how people got upset about this like it's a ridiculous take to say Jim Brown has a case over Rice."
"Pizza Pizzazz

It's like $50, and we thought it would be so dumb, used every once in a blue moon.  We were wrong. They marketed that thing all kinds of wrong.  It's perfect for heating up tons of things quickly, like pizza rolls, chicken nuggets, fries, quesadillas, etc PLUS it's great for reheating other things that don't do well in the microwave (leftover pizza, leftover grilled sandwiches). As a parent with a bunch of kids, it's been great and we use it a lot."
"Favorites instead of what I think is the best:

1. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

2. Honey and Clover

3. Mushishi

4. Hajime no Ippo

5. Neon Genesis Evangelion and The End of Evangelion

6. Chihayafuru

7. A Certain Scientific Railgun

8. Monster

9. Clannad and Clannad: Afterstory

10. The Tatami Galaxy"
"I didn't mean an average college sorry, I meant that it stands out in the UC system for biology and pre-med, but is comparable to Irvine or SB in other subjects."
"Just for a point of reference but using the term ""cologne"" is misleading and factually incorrect. Yes men like to use the word cologne when it comes to what they wear because it is deemed masculine but in reality a cologne is different from what they or you are most likely wearing. Like all of these suggestions down below, none of them are actually colognes. 

This is a ""the more you know"" kinda post"
"Philippines-2.5 months, 950 peso a night( think it was about Â£14 at the time, 420 a month).

Iâ€™d stayed before for short term and struck a deal with the owner. I think it was a 3*ish place. I stayed in a separate area next to I think the chef, still a lovely room and en suite, no different from the others. Great memories. No kitchen of course. Can be done"
"If that's the case, you should move. There are jobs everywhere, you just need to be prepared to move where they are. Even if it's somewhere you don't want to live. Moving back in with your parents isn't doing your career any favors."
KD has the better ride lineup but SFA has superior woodies
It also includes the entire arsenal of the Marine Corps.
What a bummer ðŸ˜«
*I DID IT...* ***MYYYYY WAAAAAY!***
"I'm listening to music with these on the bus as we speak. As a DJ, these are amazing headphones and extremely comfortable for long periods of use. Sometimes DJing for 6 hours takes a toll. I bought the limited edition blue and beige ones for $200 CAD, That's a steal tbh. Seinheisers are a good alternative but the M50X's have done me well"
"I agree with all of this and have about 70+ hours on it.  The game is fantastic but got stale pretty fast.  The online races kinda sucked and the game got to the point where your cars are OP as fuck and that got boring real fast.  

However I haven't played in over 3 months so I have no idea if it's any better.  Definitely the best need for speed compared to the old most wanted with all the epic destruction and shit. Probably going to play now lol"
Tapblocker don't work on iOS14. Use safariblocker instead.
"War of the ring (2nd edition) number 93


That is what I call an outrage, curse you personal opinions, otherwise good list."
Thank you kindly!
"Deadpool was removed from Steam, can't remember the exact reason but I believe it was a shift of the rights of Deadpool, perhaps due to Disney buying out Marvel?

>I'd say hit and run isn't all that great on PC, the built in controller support is wonky and has issues with newer controllers, along with weird compatibility issues with new version of windows

Good to know, I'll keep it as recommended for console then, though it will be made aware its available on PC."
"mc, I use every single feature."
