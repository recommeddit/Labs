41108,best instrument to play,"How so? A C on the 6th string does not look related to a C on the 5th string, 5th to 4th etc... 
For instance... I could not pick out all the C notes on every string, without sitting and counting them, but on the piano... C... it's the one that comes before 2 black ones. And moving on from that... a 3rd and 5th... easy to count up to on the keys, but having to count on the fret board is a little trickier.
There is no doubt that if you can master the fretboard though, that the musical side of the piano will come a lot easier."

39826,best Chrome extensions,"Static banner ads are perfectly fine. Even animated ads that stop after a few seconds are fine by me; it when the ads never ever stopped moving, when they started yelling at you the instant the page loaded, and when they literally covered the entire fucking browser window that I downloaded my first adblocker. 

The sad thing is that since adblockers have gotten common, they've only doubled-down on the invasiveness of the ads."
