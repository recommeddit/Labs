Tin Tin was really good! Also The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.
"Interstellar is the craziest mind fuck of a movie start to finish, almost entirely from all the space stuff but that last 20 minutes was intense"
"All I gotta say is this. Remember the scene with the killer and Stella? Where they exchange chilling diologue. End of season 2 maybe? 

That may be the some best writing and acting I’ve seen in television. They did such a great job making a realistic and terrifying psychopath. So many layers to that character."
"FANTASIAN on Apple Arcade is great, though it’s only the first part out now with the second part coming later this year.  Done by the some of the people that worked on the old Final Fantasy games.  Absolutely beautiful backgrounds that are all physical dioramas with the 3D sprites layered over top."
"Long Shot - DescriptionAn innocent man is accused of murder, leading his attorney on a wild chase to confirm his alibi using raw footage from a television show.

The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez - (this is one is hard to watch) A boy's murder and the trials of his guardians and social workers prompt questions about the system's protection of vulnerable children.

The Mind of Aaron Hernandez - Through interviews with friends, players and insiders, this docuseries examines how Aaron Hernandez went from an NFL star to a convicted killer."
iPhone XS
"I will admit, after brode left and they changed to a season pass I hate it, but it’s totally playable for free after a certain point. Back in the glory days I spent money on decks every month because I wanted to, but I haven’t payed a cent in the last 2 to 2.5 years due to lack of interest and lack of need. TLDR with patience you can play for free at a competitive level."
Safelink is a program to give free smartphones and plans to the homeless or just poor in general.    All you need to qualify to get one is food stamps.or any other government aid I believe
">The lenses really are better than a $20 pair.

They're better than marked up sunglasses sold in a US store for $20, chances are $20 sunglasses in the store are equivalent to $4 online.

The game changes when you spend $20-30 online. You can get a high quality pair of sunglasses which are basically identical to $80-130 sunglasses."
I liked Key West's first few albums because they were more soulful. Now all his stuff is angry and he uses too much auto-tune.
"Home Depot for replacements (Appliances, lighting, faucets, carpeting, etc).

Ace for repairs, service (screens) and paint (Clark-Kensington)."
Event Horizon
"Someone else mentioned Sunski, but I wanted to write a separate comment recommending them (instead of a reply to their comment)! They’re about $55/pair. They come polarized! They have a number of designs to select from. They come with a lifetime warranty! So if they snap on you, send it back and they’ll give you credit for a new pair! If you scratch the lenses, they sell separate lens kits so you can easily swap them out! And they’re lightweight!

I’ve replaced 1 pair so far and I’ve gotten a few lens kits (for different colors)."
"Agreed, I definitely got used to writing with my current iPad, (which is just a normal ipad with a first generation pencil).  I might try and buy a cheap paper-like protector just to test out and get a feel for.  However I do wonder how my handwriting would improve on the protector since it's definitely sloppier on the glass."
"I just bought a used Microsoft LifeCam Cinema for $15 [off Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B002MCZJ78/ref=sr_1_2_olp?ie=UTF8&qid=1376931200&sr=8-2&keywords=lifecam+cinema&condition=used), although the seller has a pretty bad rating (62%). I figured for $15, it was worth a buy. And if there was something wrong with the cam, then I'd just dispute it on Amazon.

I don't know much about the webcam market, but I did a little shopping around and it seems like the Microsoft LifeCam Studio and the Logitech HD Pro C920 are the two flagships. There aren't that many other companies that seem to come close, as all the other webcams I've seen have well under 100 reviews on Amazon."
My second choice is Oregon Blackberry ice cream.

"My collection is getting a little out of hand (when I get into something I end up diving head-first down the rabbit-hole) but my two favorites are Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream (blackberry, wisteria, jasmine, musk) and Chloe Love Story (orange blossom, jasmine, cedarwood).

I've been wearing Daisy Dream as my everyday scent and can't wait for the blasts of nostalgia I'll get later on."
I listen to it almost every time I run.
What if she doesn't invite you to attend?

I’ll keep the list updated when new functional tweaks come out or good suggestions.
Take Two > all other candies.
