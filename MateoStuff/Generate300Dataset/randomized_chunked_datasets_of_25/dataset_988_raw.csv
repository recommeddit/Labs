I am at a loss for why you are at a loss for why students have to do extra work for free money. Literally the easiest money they'll ever get. There is also the CSU system. It's even more affordable.

"I'm 24 and I've been trying to change my habits on/off since I was about 19. I have the image in my head of a better me, but I just can't keep myself motivated to keep on at things. I'm hoping this technique will help but just wanted to wish you good luck as well!"
"Just that my son continues to have good health, and a good time.  He's going to be 16 on July 23rd.  He's a master sergeant in JROTC in high school, and a straight A student.  He gets to take AP Chem next year, and wants to get his masters in Mech Engineering.  I couldn't be more happy or proud :)"
"Larger commercial freezers aren't happy unless they have stuff in them, and they're huge and noisy (and will sometimes require repair anyway.) Buy consumer stuff. 

I've seen store brand (Frigidaire and the like) chest freezers last ten or more years in a cool basement."
"Got my undergrad in music and MM in performance. I love that I play gigs frequently, but nothing is stable. I would go back and do either History or Computer Science."

Yeah it has a million views but everyone I've shown it to hasn't seen it before *shrugs*"
"Yeah, I used to love to play driving games.. but basically when I get my first supercar that's ""finished the game"" for me, so all the newer driving games are like an hour long. Once I have something that goes 200mph there's nowhere left to go. 

And trying to wrestle some piece of crap like a Chrysler Sebring with a turbo slapped on it around corners is the best part, anyway, unless it's getting some upgraded suspension parts and new tires on it so wrestling it around those corners becomes a bit easier.

If I want to drive a futuristic rocketship I'll go play F-Zero GX again."
I have both the black opium and the mon Paris couture scents from YSL. I really like the couture. You should try that roller ball also if you are a fan of ysl scents.
"No order; Sammy Baugh, Broadway Joe, Deion Sanders, Reggie White, Brett Favre, Lawrence Taylor, Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Jerry Rice.

"Met Linkin Park at Ozzfest '01 in Dallas, I was 11 walking by their booth with a long ass line, Chester and Mike seen a kid(me), told me to jump the railing, gave me a bunch of free shit they signed. Told me they were glad to see a new generation coming to concerts, and listening to rock.

Was one hell of an experience, too bad I was young, and didn't take care of the shit they gave me."
