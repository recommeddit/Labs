61830,Best RPG game on PS4,"Hate to tell you this but you never completed 1 full playthrough. You completed route A, but you still have route B and route C and endings D and E. That is classified as a full playthrough. 

It saddens me that so many people like OP put the game down after seeing the credits for route A. They don't realise they only played a third of the game.

If you have any questions incase your confused about how to play the game don't hesitate to ask and I can provide more detail"

47312,best state to visit in the United States,Atlanta is probably the last city I would recommend for a tourist. The traffic is horrible and the ghetto trash that lives there is even worse.
59159,best perfume,Yes! I love Gwen Stefani's scents. I got so many compliments on Love. I really liked her L.A.M.B. one as well. Haven't bought anything from her in a long time though.

54813,best water filter,"I use a Brita faucet filter.  About $30 for the initial filter & add-on, then about $15/filter after that.  Often a little tricky finding compatible filters, but they last a while.  Replacing it around three or four times a year sounds about right.  The light doesn't matter too much, I used my last filter until the water poked a hole through it and it started spraying my ceiling."

16243,best sunglasses for fashion,"Folks, just be careful with “cheap” sunglasses that do not legitimately protect your eyes. 

Our eyes squint to protect them from harmful UV rays. When you wear glasses that do not protect your eyes, the shades will prevent you from squinting...and your eyes will be more exposed to those harmful rays.

For the past 15 years, I’ve liked [Smith](https://www.smithoptics.com/us/) aviators. Not part of the monopoly, legitimate polarized protection, and good quality if you take care of them $99-$125.

In terms of great price point to quality, you can check out [Goodr](https://goodr.com) $25-$35."
