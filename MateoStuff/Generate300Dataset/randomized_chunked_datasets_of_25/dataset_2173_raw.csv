"Jemisin writes almost exclusively fantasy and this sub, despite what the rules say, is almost exclusively about science fiction. And also, there are a bunch of extremely popular male fantasy writers who get discussed here much less often than Jemisin."
">All 8 if you look closely, zoom in...

Your zoom prowess exceeds mine!  That is even better news."
"Burberry Brit has a special place in my heart even though I haven't worn it in years. 

When I was in my first year of college it was one of a small handful of more ""adult"" fragrances I tried out in a vain effort to seem more mature and mysterious. That part hasn't worked out yet and I'm pushing thirty, but I got a glowing compliment from one of those ""angel of femininity"" types every young lady comes across once or twice that made my week.

I was meeting a counselor at an actual university campus over transfer agreements and was entirely too nervous because I was eighteen going to a meeting alone.

I also thought anyone on their campus could smell community college on me a mile away, which is pretty funny in hindsight. 

The counselor I met was absolutely beautiful, the kind of perfectly made up lady that just exudes confidence. Not cougar confidence, *classic* confidence. Putting on her face would have cost me another textbook, easy. 

We had the meeting, and when she walked me out she left her hand on my shoulder for a second and just said, ""The perfume you're wearing suits your skin very well.""

I went on about this for entirely too long but I think other people who love scent and flavor understand how important those types of memories are to keep vivid. Thanks for reading the ramble if you're the sentimental sort like me."
The Departed.  Never seen a movie committed to the end of their primary characters the way that one was.
Wikiwand should be there
"Alot of people dont know, but the video is actually a remake of what happened since they weren't originally recording it. The guy speaking is blurting out nonsensical percentages as a kind of ode to that fact."
"Fair enough. 

Looks like we agree that it's not a great intro to cocktails, though, for someone that doesn't already have a taste for booze."
"Thickness shouldn't be an issue though, since this is about external USB webcams primarily for desktops, so unless you make the thing thicker and messier than the dslr camera + capture card setups people are using instead of webcams because they can't find a decent webcam they will remain competitive."
"So how should I brush my teeth? I brush around the 5 minutes, but the dentists keep bitchen about me not brushing good enough."
Reds with o rings or nothing
"Also in the 1951-1952 was Fatt and Katz. The idea that they could use a histogram to show that synapses send signals in a quantized fashion blows my mind. They didn't even know about vesicles.

I'd like to point out this page from SFN.

"Maybe you're mistaking two different situations, but for sure the butthole picture was due to Kanye and Taylor's fued. Had absolutely nothing to do with slut shaming.

"Muh brotha.

Baccano!, Durarara!! and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou are some of my favourite anime.

We seem to have similar taste in comedy so I'll just add your other suggestions as 'plan to watch' in MAL.

If you haven't yet, I'd recommend watching Cromartie Highschool and Gin no Saji (the second season of Gin no Saji is pretty bad though)."
A real engineering calculator.  RPN FTW.
"My contract doesn't allow me to reveal recipes.  But I recommend starting with your base recipe, and adding more beer than you think you should.  strong IPA's are my favorite.  We also make an oatmeal stout gelato with homemade oatmeal raisin cookie dough."
I've got the R5 3600 and paired with the Sapphire Pulse 5600XT (300USD) it will do 1080p 144 fps in almost any game at high settings. Easily get over 144 fps in modern warfare at everything high and around 100 in Warzone at everything high. It's a great card and definitely worth it from my experience. If you need fps for any other game just reply with the game and I'll tell you what I got with it.

It’s been more consistent than TD. It hasn’t had an average season yet. All 3 are top-quality TV.

">Are there any fully online accredited colleges, hopefully affordable, where I could possibly transfer my existing credits and come out with a degree that is respectable?

You could see if any local universities offer online programs. Most 'colleges' that are marketed as fully online, inexpensive, and a fast track into IT are not what I'd call respectable. You could also try to go for some certs instead; you'd likely end up more knowledgeable than with an online program. 

maybe try /r/itcareerquestions"
"> I was worried it would be too competitive and not enough money in it

Anthropology is not a good program to avoid this reality."
