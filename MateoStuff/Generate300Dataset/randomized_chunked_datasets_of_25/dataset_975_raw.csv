"The best webcam I have ever owned is one I got back in like 2002. It had its own hardware encoder and image processor, with a big-ass sensor and lens, so even though it was only like 640x480 the image quality was far beyond all but the best today, 20 years later. Unfortunately they stopped supporting it and drivers stopped working when Windows 7 came out.

I would absolutely pay a good price for a good webcam, they just don't exist. Even the newer 4k ones may have decent sensors but everything else is poor, and for video conferencing (particularly large groups) resolution matters less than framerate, color accuracy, white balance, focus, etc."
The devil you know was an eye opener. Good doc.
Would highly suggest people to watch it and judge for yourself. It's not even close to being one of the worst documentaries on Netflix. It was super hyped when it first came out and was overall a very interesting series.
"Hmm, ""Must watch"", or ""favourites""? They're slightly different, as the former will tend to be more accessible stuff with a broader base appeal that can then be built upon once the viewer is familiar with the tropes and conventions of the medium.

For the former: 

______________

**[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate):**

* *Trailer:* [English dubbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaOvEIkeyzU) for the first half. If you don't mind spoilers in your trailers, [this AMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub5iP0GQ5QA) is fantastic.

* *What it's about:* Okabe Rintarou is a self-proclaimed ""Mad Scientist"", living primarily on Ramen noodles and Dr Pepper while building wacky inventions with his otaku friend Daru. Things take a turn for the weird when he discovers that one of his stranger creations apparently functions as a time machine capable of sending messages into the past. And just when he thinks he's beginning to get a handle on his new reality, things begin to unravel, leaving him racing to pick up the pieces before they're lost entirely.

* *Why watch it?:* Steins;Gate is really two shows stitched into one. The first half is a fairly entertaining slice-of-life drama following a cast of larger-than-life characters bouncing ideas and banter off against one another. The second half is much darker, exploring the consequences of actions taken earlier in the story and driving towards a car crash of a conclusion.

* *Caveats:* The first half of the show is fairly slow. Entertaining, but slow. It's not until the half-way mark that things really start to pick up. Stick with it - the journey and the end are both worth it. The follow-up OVA and movie, however, are ""take-it-or-leave-it"". They nominally progress the story a little after the conclusion, but everything was pretty neatly tied up in the show's finale.

* *Similar works:* **Madoka Magica** springs to mind for a number of reasons. **Robotics;Notes** is set in the same world and has many similarities, but it isn’t *quite* as good as Steins;Gate. The manga **Murasakiiro no Qualia** is definitely worth checking out if you enjoyed this.

**[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood):**

* *Trailer:* [Dubbed version]( http://www.madman.com.au/videos/view/2141/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood).

* *What it's about:* The magic of alchemy makes many things possible, but there is one ironclad rule: for everything you gain, something of equal value must be sacrificed. Edward and Alphonse Elric made a mistake in their youth and paid a horrific cost. Now they seek to regain what they lost by searching for the mythical ""Philosopher's Stone"", an artifact that nullifies the rule of ""equivalent exchange"".

* *Why watch it?:* For one, it's the highest-rated anime series of all time. And for good reason. An expertly woven story of sacrifice, love and duty, populated by a wide cast of interesting and memorable characters, Fullmetal Alchemist blends action and humour with a deep plot in a fully-realised fictional world. And, just as requested, it concludes with a solid **bang**, leaving no loose ends.

* *Caveats:* The humour leans heavily towards slapstick and super-deformed ""chibi"" characters. While the primary and secondary cast are all well-developed, there remain a significant number of one-note side characters that pop up repeatedly, testing your patience with how far the writers are willing to stretch a single joke.

* *Theme(s):* Family. Guilt, hatred, and self-hatred, and how they feed into a cycle of violence. The importance of sacrifice.

* *Similar works:* The original 2003 adaptation of **[Fullmetal Alchemist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist)** is an obvious choice. While set in the same world and given the same start, the two stories deviate wildly after a certain point. It also spends a lot more time on the first act of the story, fleshing out many incidents that Brotherhood glossed over in the interest of time.

**[Ghost in the Shell](http://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Ghost_in_the_Shell)**

* *Trailer:* [DVD trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvBVDibOrgs)

* *What it's about:* The year is 2029 and the world has been fundamentally changed by the ongoing digital revolution. Cybernetics and mind uploading has become common-place, and those with the ability to hack into such systems are regarded as national assets. The story follows a group of police officers trying to track down one such hacker, a person known only as ""The Puppetmaster"".

* *Why watch it:* Ghost in the Shell is one of the true classics of the entire medium. It's a must-see if you want to understand how anime got to the way it is today. The animation stands up surprisingly well for a series that's almost twenty years old, and the plot masterfully combines action and philosophy without a single stumble. The soundtrack, aesthetic, and plot ideas have inspired dozens if not hundreds of copycat attempts.

* *Caveats:* The animation *does* hold up well, but it's nonetheless obvious that this is an older work, particularly with regards to sound design. 

* *Themes:* Mind/Body duality. The nature of consciousness and the soul

* *Similar works:* **[Akira](http://myanimelist.net/anime/47/Akira)**, **[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)**, **[Bubblegum Crisis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1347/Bubblegum_Crisis)**. Outside of anime, **Blade Runner** and **Neuromancer.**

_________________

**[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note)**

* *Trailer:* [Dubbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J6CIpoYCV0)

* *What it's about*: One day, a hyperintelligent but bored teenager finds a notebook with a set of instructions attached: write someone's name in the book while thinking of their face, and they will die. He immediately sets about trying to use this new power to ""purify"" the world of all criminals and set up a new social order with himself at the head. In the process, he ends up pitting his wits against an equally brilliant detective trying to put a stop to the ongoing murders.

* *Why you should watch it?*: Death Note is a cornerstone of modern anime; it's one of the few shows almost universally regarded as a decent entry-point into the medium. The story is gripping, fast-paced, and full of twists and turns. Light Yagami is one of the most expert renderings of a descent into sociopathy that I've seen in modern fiction, and his conflict with L is endlessly fascinating. The show is the closest anime has come to ""Breaking Bad"".

* *Caveats*: The first thing people talk about when it comes to Death Note is the endless ""PLOT TWIST""s - a certain level of suspension of disbelief is required with regards to some of what goes on. The second thing everybody will talk about is that the latter half is noticeably weaker than the early material. It's true that there's a sudden lurch in the pacing after a particularly critical event, and plot holes begin to build up in the race to the finish-line. But if you're willing to roll with it, Death Note remains solidly entertaining from start to end.

* *Theme(s):* Corruption of power. Ennui and hubris.

* *Similar works:* Plotwise, **[Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch)**.  **[Zankyou no Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)** has a similar dynamic to it. 

______________________

**[Code Geass:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch)**

* *Trailer:* [English Dub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKAwzRuLKi0)

* *What it's about*: Japan is subjugated by the oppressive Britannian Empire, its name changed to the Orwellian ""Area 11"" and its people treated as second-class citizens. One day, a hyper-intelligent school-boy serendipitously receives the supernatural ability to enforce obedience to a single command on anyone he sees. With no other resources, how can you leverage this power into toppling a world-spanning empire?

* *Why watch it?*: Going by the numbers, the standard protagonist for this setting would be Suzaku, an optimistic, ""things will change if I try hard enough!"" boyscout of a character. This is not his story. Instead, the focus is on Lelouche, a scheming, underhanded plotter who is entirely willing to justify his means by his ends. Unlike a lot of action-heavy shows, the primary focus of Code Geass is at the *strategic* level - the protagonist is explicitly *not* a fighter but a thinker, a planner. And the plots just keep getting crazier and crazier as the series progresses. The finale is widely regarded as one of the most cathartic in any anime, though the story contorts itself at times to get to that point.

* *Caveats*: The fighting is based on mecha, which automatically turns some people off. The school-based sections are blatant filler and often feel a little forced. The level of fan-service is quite high, with more than a few extraneous lingering boob shots. The ""twists upon twists"" can break suspension of disbelief, if you're not willing to extend much of it. Finally, the character designs are pretty stylised - you get used to them, but they're pretty noticeable at the start.

* *Primary theme(s)*: How best to fix a broken system: Reform vs Revolution. Do the ends justify the means?

* *Similar works:* In order of ""dark"" to ""light"" stories: **[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note)**, **[Guilty Crown](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10793/Guilty_Crown)**, **[Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon)**, **[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)**"
I don't understand the ending. What does she say to the general?
"This does seem like a good deal. I got an MSI 32"" 1440p 144 Hz monitor for close to $300 around Christmas 2018."
"I agree, I really liked their latest album."
"you, sir, are ahead of the game."
I'm very surprised NetBSD is that high up.
Oh fuck I totally forgot about that one! Great movie. Been on a Korean movie binge lately I guess it's time to get some Chinese in there. And holy crap it's on Netflix.
"You're right, I just think undergrads ought to be considering the bigger picture."
"OnePlus 7 Pro's 90hz OLED screen, the ASUS ROG's 120hz OLED screen, are the only devices with a better screen that I've found so far.

The iPad Pro 11"" my OH owns has a gorgeous display too, but even at 120hz the slow response times of IPS screens are very obvious.

Its the same on my 144hz IPS monitor, ghosting and trails when scrolling or fast moving content is on screen. Like I can scroll fast on the OnePlus and text is still solid and readable, but on the iPad and my monitor it turns into a blurry fluid mess."
"Denver, CO; San Francisco, CA; Austin, TX; and New York."
