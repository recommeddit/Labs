"haha, I agree. I always end up writing a ton, so I've gotten pretty good at typing on my phone lol."
"A Cook Book.

Not like a fad celebrity book but a real oldschool family cookbook.

Best one I ever found was at a garage sale and was like 6"" thick Ring binder full to the brim with yellow pages some with stains.  It honestly should have been a family treasure and I got it for $20.

Hundreds of family recipes with easy to follow hand writen notes.  I'm sad i never met the grandma that this thing once belonged to.

Edit: Wow thanks for all the up votes.  Its nice to read the comments about other people that have found cool old cook books.

Edit 2:  OMG this is my biggest post ever.  Thank you for the awards and all the votes.  You all made my day :)

Edit 3: Sweet Raptor Jesus...I guess i have a project now to scan and upload this book.

Umm a few people asked so here is my favorite recipe.  These things are amazing and disappear so fast.

"I always wanted to be a pilot when I was younger. However after doing some research I heard it's pretty hard to get a job as an airline pilot. There are 3 ways to get a private pilots license and thats the civilian route, airforce, or an aviation school. The cheapest option is the airforce but I never wanted to join a branch of military. Civ route and aviation school are expensive af. Thus my dream of being an pilot for a major airline has been squashed."
seconded. my mom came to visit - i live out of state - and she held the baby while I got a haircut. SO NICE.
"Yes! It's so beautiful, clever, and moving. The twist is very nice but it's not like it's the only good thing about the movie."
"Personally I would say The Three Body Problem and its squeals are an easy choice here.  If the Amazon adaptation takes off it has the potential to be massive in the west and even more massive considering the size of the Chinese market.


Neal Stephenson should probably be considered in general but (much like you list Philip K Dick) he might be known more generally rather than for a specific work.  The standout is technically outside your scope but Snowcrash is a book about internet memes in an MMO written in in 1992.  


The Martian also deserves consideration, its not often hard SF like that gets so popular in mainstream culture.


Ready Player One will probably be in the discussion but doesn't deserve it at all."
"Not at all, Iâ€™ll grab her later and get one posted. They do some really lovely stuff, Clogau."
"They get what they pay for, though."
"The 3GS was a game-changer in its time.

I still have and use a 6S, which set the baseline for a number of models"
"I picked this up young, and it blew my mind. Never thought before about anthro origins, and the different moties were fascinating. I can't see a bunch of small creatures in a small space IRL without thinking about the watchmakers in the gun batteries. Gives me the willies.

The sequel...not so much."
"Tom Holland now, of course

Previously, I always felt that Tobey Maguire was the better Peter Parker, while Andrew Garfield was the better Spider-Man, if that makes sense.

Tobeys jokes as Spider-Man just didn't land for me, and Andrews Peter Parker was too quirky/""cool"" to properly be Parker

Tom Holland is best at both though, so..."
That was George Micheal Bluth
"I forgot if it is mentioned in the film or is this my own interpretation, but he did it to experience how his wife felt when she drowned in the act at the beginning of the film. Also he didn't know if drowning is painful because his engineer lied and told him drowning feels like ""going home"" instead of being ""agony"". So he didn't know he was subjecting his copies or him to suffering. 

As for the bodies, I feel that he wanted to ""end it all"" after the 100 days of limited performance so he doesn't feel that need to dispose of the bodies. After his wife died, the only purpose of his life is to figure out The Professor's secret so that he can destroy him. He doesn't care about anything else, not even the real secret."
Canada. There's nothing more peaceful than waking up in the mist of fall and looking over the great lakes with a glass of jack in your hand
"Also I second Dear Zachary, but DO NOT READ ANY SPOILERS"
Sure if that's all you have available
In Oregon you can major in transferring at a community college.  It's basically a general studies degree but every public Oregon university has agreed that you don't need any 100 or 200 level classes if transfer with it.

A dogwood would look great there
"You don't need a masters in accounting. If you have an accounting degree, the additional 30 hours can be in anything. The hard part is the exam. There are 4 sections and the pass rate for each section is under 50%.

"Are you really surprised? The internet presents an opportunity to make what is essentially a strip club very they don't have to pay for rent or security and there is no upper limit to the number of people who can attend (neither geographic nor space), and the visitors don't need to be seen entering a strip club. Twitch decided to become that strip club"

"My English professor recently loaned me Gene Wolfe's *Book of The New Sun* tetralogy. I don't even *like* fantasy, and I loved them."
My grandfather had just passed and I had some of his favorite old button up shirts turned into square pillow cases for the couch. I got a few made for her brothers and sister.
