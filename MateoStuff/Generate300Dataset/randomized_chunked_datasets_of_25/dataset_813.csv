37601,best Marvel movie,"Agreed for The Dark World which is more or less equal to The Incredible Hulk and perhaps the OG Thor. 

I find Black Panther to be the heaviest dramatically in the MCU so I disagree with that, but I respect your opinion."
38507,best newspapers to read,"I often read one of the crappy newspapers that are in dutch busses when i go to school, and we have get a newspaper at home every day (except for sundays). I like reading newspapers who are actually made of paper more than e-papers, just because paper reads better than pc-screen."

13440,best spreadsheet editor,"It's not like a SQL query syntax, but it is like a basic database behavior where you can cycle through the rows until you match values of one column and then read or write the values of another column."
10851,best suitcase lock,"It's small enough, yes, but not hard enough."
53958,best medicine for a cold,"As a primary care M.D. this is where I find there is a big disconnect between patients and doctors.  Technically there is nothing that actually *can* be done for a ""cold"".  We say this all the time.  The M.D.'s aren't withholding any great cure or preventative measures, and what's worse ""idle hands is a devil's workshop"" causes a lot of over-prescribing of antibiotics. 

BUT.. (and I really mean it when I say I wish cost was not an issue).. I don't mind looking people over because people do come in with things they chalked up to a ""cold"".. but is actually something worse or more dangerous.  

I don't mind alternative treatments, and am not opposed.  I don't personally use them much.  And I do get the common cold 1-3x a year.  My unofficial-official recommendation is:

1. good health and some vitamins for prevention.  decrease exposure if possible.  

2. Ibuprofen 600mg or Advil cold 'n Sinus+2 ibuprofen for symptoms.  Dextromethorphan (w/ or w/out guiafinesen) for bronchial symptoms.  (like alka-seltzer cough 'n cold).  

3. Rest.  hydration. (edit in: cough drops.. surprised so many forget cough drops.  They at least help with symptoms: Halls, Fishman's Friend)

All colds will last *usually* 5-14 days depending.  With a possible post-viral cough (cough after cold) lasting up to 4-6 weeks (really.. it sucks for some people).  I actually like how the wiki-cold list correlates very closely to what I recommend."

>¬†Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people‚Äôs agendas?
>
>If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the Way of the EssentialistThe Way of the Essentialist isn‚Äôt about getting more done in less time. It‚Äôs about getting only the right things done.¬† It is not¬†¬†a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.¬†

53798,best medicine for a cold,"Hot toddies. Hot tea, brandy or whiskey, honey, lemon juice, cloves, cinnamon. Tasty as fuck and is a miracle cure.

Also, if you get a bad cough, there is a type of tea you should be able to find at just about any grocery store that is a godsend. It's called Lemon Echinacea Throat Coat. Add some honey, and drink it as often as you can. It's the only thing that saved me when I had whooping cough."

59637,best perfume,"My guess is that you are in your 30s or 40s. You have a taste for naturalistic scents, and you appreciate both quiet and bold fragrances. 

I've seen you posting before so maybe this is cheating but I'd say you're a gardener and enjoy hiking or going our and identifying plants and fungi. I think you have a good eye for detail, so I bet you enjoy cooking and eating complex dishes but also enjoy something more simple and straightforward that's made with high quality ingredients. 

I'd guess that you like pop culture and occasionally binge shows on Netflix/Hulu/etc. You enjoy some reality tv occasionally. You have a curated sense of style; the people in your life can easily identify your look and taste."
