Hopefully next year we'll have more people taking part who have ridden the awesome wooden coasters in China so they get more accurate rankings. Once that happens I'm sure we'll see more wooden coasters in the top 100. :)",best amusement park

I loved Oceanheart as well.

And there was a rogue-like RPG forgot the name that you can make different classes.EDIT: I think it was Battleheart. Been so long.

53893,"What I have only recently started doing as of last year is using warm saline water to rinse out my nasal cavity, then using a squirty brand of Pseudoephedrine like sudafed to stop things- the clear nasal cavity means that the medication gets to work. 

Paracetamol will lower your temperature, codeine helps stop the cough reflex and honey is good for your throat. 

Can't recommend the saline rinse hard enough, though- test the water temperature on your wrist like you would for a baby's bottle; oh, and I just use a squirty 'sports' water bottle to do mine- no fancy netty pot needed :)",best medicine for a cold
