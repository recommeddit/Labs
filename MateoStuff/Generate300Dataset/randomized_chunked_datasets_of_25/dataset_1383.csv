It's also known that women who have sinus issues can alleviate the problem by having orgasms."
19054,best YouTube video,"Don't forget about the third channel, Kurtis Conner."
16814,best pet for toddlers,I have a cousin with chihuahuas that have them litter trained. Mostly because they live some place that gets hellaciously cold in the winter and the winter lasts forever.

65115,best phone service company,When did they implement that? I was with them for years and only ever saw my bill go up
73598,best battery bank,"I'm skeptical of the 100W charger - that's a *massive* amount of current to be pumping through a package that small. Seeing as there's no other competitors, it's likely that it outputs less and is just labeled wrong to try and sell better."
14110,best place to get free books,Tysm!!
51133,best rap album,"But like someone else pointed out, ""white male rockers"" are the only ones that do that. A country magazine (well, I assume, I don't read them) wold specify that they were talking about country, cut the bullshit and just talk about country. I think that's preferable to this."
60901,Best comedy show on Netflix,Dayman!
67482,axios alternatives reddit,You’re not going to get far as a developer with that attitude.
37122,best amusement park,"This is it right, it's entirely subjective. I think most people prefer steel roller coasters over wooden ones. Personally I'm right with you, I absolutely love a solid wooden roller coaster. Hopefully next year we'll have more people taking part who have ridden the awesome wooden coasters in China so they get more accurate rankings. Once that happens I'm sure we'll see more wooden coasters in the top 100. :)"
30791,best country to live in,"South African here. We have regular power cuts, high crime, and bad race relations. Many white people despise black people and blame all the country's problems on them, and many black people resent white people and blame all the country's problems on them. Also, lots of South African drive like utter dickheads and the massive amount of poverty is quite depressing."
15011,best romantic novel,"I don't watch Veep so I had to google them a bit, they seem cute! That enemies-to-lovers trope is my favorite. Generally though, GoodReads is really a great way of finding interesting books, try signing up if you already don't have an account and browse away."

20708,best workout music,Literally any Meek Mill will do
17176,best iOS game,"My favorite game by far has been an ARPG called CrimsonHeart which came out in 2012. It was the best ARPG on iOS I have ever played. It disappeared from the store. I wish that it would come back one day or they make part 2.

I loved Oceanheart as well.

And there was a rogue-like RPG forgot the name that you can make different classes.EDIT: I think it was Battleheart. Been so long.

Edit 2: How can I forget the Infinity Blade games! The nostalgia! I feel old now. Brb gonna pour a drink."
53893,best medicine for a cold,"What I have only recently started doing as of last year is using warm saline water to rinse out my nasal cavity, then using a squirty brand of Pseudoephedrine like sudafed to stop things- the clear nasal cavity means that the medication gets to work. 

Paracetamol will lower your temperature, codeine helps stop the cough reflex and honey is good for your throat. 

Can't recommend the saline rinse hard enough, though- test the water temperature on your wrist like you would for a baby's bottle; oh, and I just use a squirty 'sports' water bottle to do mine- no fancy netty pot needed :)"
45180,best items under $100,"Technically, my pets originally cost less than 100$, so I'm going with them. c:"
