30646,best Mexican war to study,"Well, *sorry*, I guess. Other people on r/history probably care more about historical accuracy than you do, though, so just pretend my minor correction was for them?"
28540,best breakfast foods,Blending it makes it taste great like a foamy latte. People put cream in their coffee butter isn't much different from cream at the end of the day. Use high quality butter like Kerry gold.

Did this cause I was inspired by people comments, I'll keep you updated."
