"Does it, though? These public universities have incredible prestige as aggregate institutions, but they result in really large class sizes for most undergrads. There are instances of people needing five years to graduate because they can’t get the classes they want. The research output is of course phenomenal, but I’m not sure that translates to college. Keep in mind this is the undergrad ranking. UCB is almost always among the global T20 universities and sometimes T10, of which it’s quite deserving."
I love it. Accurate to me and all my musician friends.

I was going to go with ITT: People under 21
"Thanks, I'll have to try that some time."
Can't forget Speed Dial
"See that's why I don't get the point of making the Rx anyway when docs are more than happy to Rx them when they know they won't do anything at all. I've literally had a doc say ""it's viral so antibiotics won't help but I'll write you a Rx anyway in case it does help any."" Like wtf? And I hadn't been asking for them or anything; in fact, after the doc said that I said not to bother if it's not actually helpful, as I didn't want the extra expense and pills for no good reason. They shrugged and gave me the Rx ""in case you change your mind."" Ffffff thanks???"
Ma man. I'd have to add Grand Blue tho

"Yeah I actually enjoyed the progression curve quite a bit. It was the first time in a while that a racing game made me feel accomplished when I got a new car/part. This was coming from Forza Horizon 4 though, where the game gives you free cars basically every time you log in, so I guess it's a low bar to set."
"On the weekends I like to have a Caesar (drink), eggs over easy on a toasted English muffin with tomato and avocado, and some bacon.

Other days I like natto on brown rice with shiso and green onion and some miso soup."

">Then your company can pay for RHEL to offload some liability. 

Like what?

How does Red Hat assume liability and for what exactly?"
"Dagon wasn't too bad either. And it gets bonus points for taking place in the town of Imboca, which is Spanish for ""in mouth"" - Innsmouth. :)"
"I’ll give it a shot, thanks man"
"I might just be that dude, but maybe do just a little guide on how to determine what kind of foot you have ?

"I sometimes do that if I get bored of music, especially running. Try comedy albums too, it makes the time very enjoyable."

"Favorite war ATM: (Not really a war I guess) Invasion of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson almost won...almost. He fuckin' had to beat off two invading armies at once, without the support of any other country or the Papacy, and he came within one cavalry charge of victory. 

Read 1066, it's an awesome book with tons of information. I learned a lot about the misconceptions surrounding the Norman invasion."
Oddly enough I've never read the new Yorker. Ill have to check it out. Thanks!
Is this the same situation though? Do the textbook authors get 0% while 100% goes to the publisher? I would have thought probably not.
"If you’re interested in trying something, I just started using The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser because of my sensitive skin. It goes on dry and you massage it into an oil then rinse off with water. Very interesting and doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin at all."
I find a great selection on Iptorrents
