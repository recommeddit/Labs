25184,best spiderman actor,I 100% agree
683,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"I've been reading it for the last 5 years. I don't have to provide evidence to YOU as it was a couple years ago and I'm not a librarian. If you want to use Nord and get caught, be my guest."
70216,best major to study in college,"As a Philosophy major I can say we don't earn much, but we could probably write a better article than this."
47002,best hand santizer brand,Also to note that our livers don't work that well on the kind of alcohol that's in most hand santizers. The lethal dose of isopropyl alcohol by mouth in adult humans is about 8 ounces. Methyl also kills us. Evolution gave us this particular resistance because ethyl alcohol is in fruit. Being able to consume half rotten fruit is a huge survivability benefit.
12722,best gifts for mom,"I've asked for skincare stuff from clinique. Or quality nail polish. I book all my beauty treatments online so vouchers for that are good. I'm not into specific 'spa days' or treatment vouchers because I'm really very particular about where I go.

I like anything to do with my hobbies (D&D, reading and video games), so fill with your parents hobby of choice.

Last year I got my Mum a Netflix subscription (she complained there was nothing on it, but watched >100hrs in a month so go figure). My son got her a voucher for a restaurant and we took her out for a meal all together. 

My son is pretty young and last year was the first year he picked me out a gift, and honestly it was the best thing ever. I have a horrible allergic reaction to the earrings he picked but you can pry them out my cold dead hands if you think I'm ever giving them up. When I'm sad I open them up and look at them to make me happy :) Just give it some thoughtfullness and tell them about it and they'll love it!"
16700,best pet for toddlers,"Only get a dog if you have a lot of free time and enjoy it too. He has to go out a lot of times a day. They need to be trained harder than kids at the beginning so that you have some kind of harmony at home. Sometimes they get I'll and poo in your house... :) 

A cat might be easier to handle if you get a nice one.

More easy are birds. And kids have fun too with them."
11451,best gifts for dad,Sorry! ðŸ˜¬ I promise it wasn't my intention and I'm quite optimistic :-)
16003,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have prescription sunglasses, [these, to be exact](https://www.classicspecs.com/womens-sunglasses-vanderbilt-black-crystal-020330040019016F)"
11336,best gifts for dad,"Time.  All I want is my daughter's time.  Right now, she's only 3 years old, so it's pretty easy.  We can spend the day together.  That's the tradition I hope to start.  I know it'll be harder for her as she get's older and goes her own way, so I'll make as many memories as I can while we can.  Physical stuff doesn't matter to me, memories do."
55120,best places to hike in the east coast,THANK YOU for specifying both upstate and western NY.  We here in Buffalo are so tired of being called 'upstate'.
11159,best backpack for college,"I've never found anyone that has built a more sturdy pack than what Duluth Pack puts together. While I've not used their smaller personal packs, if they are built anything like their type-4 canoe pack you will be hard pressed to destroy it. With close to 2000 miles logged canoing up north, and plenty of terrible portages, I think I have a lot of experience to speak from and the Duluth pack has never failed me.

17651,best iOS game,Yes ! I recommend it 100%
32445,best vacation resort,"Thatâ€™s why I asked peopleâ€™s opinions I donâ€™t want to hear a review of places I want to hear where people had good experiences. Ratings and reviews never meant anything to me Iâ€™d rather hear first hand experience. And Iâ€™m not high maintenance. I just want nice views, nice weather unlimited food and drinks maybe some activities not too much in just trying to relax. Thank you for your feedback!"
19938,best workout music,Not even [Physical by Olivia Newton-John](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz9VN40nCA). It's as if they've done absolutely no research for this at all!
65704,best college in california,"Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbra, and USC."
7795,best laptop for general use,"Hi, it very much depends on how much you plan on spending. If you go with a MacBook, there's no point in getting the MacBook Pro unless you need the touch bar or longer battery life. Otherwise, I'd go with the MacBook Air. It is simple device that is generally user friendly. Their build quality is good, so I wouldn't call them fragile, but they are expensive to repair."
1719,best ice cream flavor,Salted caramel or strawberrry
65127,best phone service company,Yeahâ€¦ I havenâ€™t ventured that far out beforeâ€¦
69432,best major to study in college,It would have taken you less than 9 months if your father or uncle was an exec or knew one.
8988,best toothpaste,"Look for one that uses Xylitol as its sweetener, it cannot be broken down by the bacteria, like others, and as such is antimicrobial. It is also low calorie!"
