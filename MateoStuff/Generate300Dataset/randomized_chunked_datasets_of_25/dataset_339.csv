47002,Also to note that our livers don't work that well on the kind of alcohol that's in most hand santizers. The lethal dose of isopropyl alcohol by mouth in adult humans is about 8 ounces. Methyl also kills us. Evolution gave us this particular resistance because ethyl alcohol is in fruit. Being able to consume half rotten fruit is a huge survivability benefit.,best hand santizer brand
12722,"I've asked for skincare stuff from clinique. Or quality nail polish. I book all my beauty treatments online so vouchers for that are good. I'm not into specific 'spa days' or treatment vouchers because I'm really very particular about where I go.

I like anything to do with my hobbies (D&D, reading and video games), so fill with your parents hobby of choice.

Last year I got my Mum a Netflix subscription (she complained there was nothing on it, but watched >100hrs in a month so go figure). My son got her a voucher for a restaurant and we took her out for a meal all together. 

My son is pretty young and last year was the first year he picked me out a gift, and honestly it was the best thing ever. I have a horrible allergic reaction to the earrings he picked but you can pry them out my cold dead hands if you think I'm ever giving them up. When I'm sad I open them up and look at them to make me happy :) Just give it some thoughtfullness and tell them about it and they'll love it!",best gifts for mom
16700,"Only get a dog if you have a lot of free time and enjoy it too. He has to go out a lot of times a day. They need to be trained harder than kids at the beginning so that you have some kind of harmony at home. Sometimes they get I'll and poo in your house... :)

I know it'll be harder for her as she get's older and goes her own way, so I'll make as many memories as I can while we can.  Physical stuff doesn't matter to me, memories do.",best gifts for dad

11159,"I've never found anyone that has built a more sturdy pack than what Duluth Pack puts together. While I've not used their smaller personal packs, if they are built anything like their type-4 canoe pack you will be hard pressed to destroy it. With close to 2000 miles logged canoing up north, and plenty of terrible portages, I think I have a lot of experience to speak from and the Duluth pack has never failed me.

Otherwise, I'd go with the MacBook Air. It is simple device that is generally user friendly.
