> Amazon same-day

This one I'll grant, though what I miss more is the cheap used items on Amazon Marketplace (the stuff on Amazon UK has less selection and higher prices / shipping costs).

> beer growlers

Microbreweries here will do those. I've gotten some from Mikkeller.

> Uber

Never heard of this. Googling, it looks like some kind of taxi service? I guess everyone here just bikes or takes the metro, which is way better than American transit.

> ubiquitous corner stores, cheap and tasty restaurants and food carts on every block, places that are open late so you can go after work

We've got all that, except that it isn't cheap. Although, I've never lived anywhere in the USA that had any of that. Did you live in NYC? There weren't really any corner stores or food carts when I lived in either Houston or Atlanta.",best country to live in

9313,"Marvis 100%. I believe it’s an Italian brand on Sephora. It’s Vegan (and natural for the most part I think) and the only toothpaste to ever actually whiten my teeth. After getting some cavities filled, my dentist recommended I started using a toothpaste with xylitol in it (xylitol can help prevent cavities), so I decided to try Marvis since that’s what Shawn Mendes uses (crazy I know, my friend and I saw it in one of his posts haha) and honestly I adore it. Not to mention the flavors are amazing (the whitening and the jasmine mint are my favorites) and the packaging is classy",best toothpaste

60791,"Did you like his newest one? I dunno if I just wasn’t in the right mood or what but his newest just didn’t seem funny like his older stuff. To be fair, I’ve been sick the past few days so maybe that had something to do with it. So someone please tell me if it’s good and it was just me. If so I’ll watch again. I only made it about 1/3 of the way through I think and then turned it off. I loved his older stuff though.",Best comedy show on Netflix

2483,"If you're wondering why you're downvoted to oblivion, the question regarded headphones and not earbuds, and come on... skullcandy is commercial hogwash, there's so many earbuds I could recommend in the 20-30 price range that would crush pretty much anything skullcandy, but if you actually want some *good* earbuds you'd have to go beyond at least 40-50 bucks minimum. Whatever you do, unless you're loaded, don't buy earbuds for more than 60$, it's just never worth it, I've wasted too much money on that to just have them ripped apart by accident, and as soon I'm home it's back to beyerdynamic headphones.",best headphones
24988,"But I feel like the opening scenes of the original Spiderman solidify Toby as the best. Playing the unassuming kid and being, at the end of the day, just a normal young adult. You're telling me you think the new movies can beat the Toby McGuire ""GO WEB GO"" scene or the bedroom scene where he learns about his powers? Passive can be beneficial. Give me that extra-detailed exposition. Give me The Macho Man Randy Savage. Give me a HUMAN feeling movie that I believe only Toby could capture.",best spiderman actor
