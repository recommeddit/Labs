The schools that I aware of that offer distance degrees usually require at least a weekend or two in a classroom setting.

Of course, I don't know the curriculum of every university, but I am unaware of any. Does anyone know of a traditional, non-profit university that offers a one hundred percent online degree?",best online college

What precisely do you mean by not having what it takes to be a platform?
Most plugins work great and can be customized for your own benefit, however you want to map them. CPU cycles - I'm not sure this is a problem since vim is so lightweight, I've never had a problem even with large projects. I feel that most IDE's are bloated, with too many features you don't need. You can basically create an IDE from vim just by extending it's functionality via plugins.

30426,"Just want to add to some of your points:

The tactics of the Civil War were basically Napoleonic in nature (less massed cavalry used for shock effect) with weapons that made the tactics obsolete.  Every soldier on both sides during the Civil War was armed with a rifle that was accurate to 300 meters or beyond.  Smoothbore muskets are good out to 80 meters or so, hence the need for massed volleys to hit anything.  

Rifles were in use as early as 1805, but only employed by specialized troops.  The British Brown Bess could be loaded and fired at least three times a minute (faster by better trained/experienced troops), but it's a smoothbore firing a round ball.  The Baker Rifle, on the other hand, could only be fired once a minute because of the greased leather patch needed to insure the lands in the barrel gripped the ball.  It was a bitch to ram the ball down the rifled barrel, especially if the barrel was fouled by previous shots fired.  The advantage of the Baker Rifle was it's accuracy - you can easily hit a man sized target 200-300 meters away.  This lead to the Baker Rifle being used for specialized troops - skirmishers who would pick off Officers and NCOs to sow confusion in the ranks.  When the fighting got serious, the Riflemen would just ram the ball and a regular patch down the barrel - much faster, but not appreciably more accurate than a regular musket.  If you're fighting like this, the only way that makes sense is to get a whole bunch of your buddies together, line up, and get real close to the people you're trying to kill.  If you fire in volley, you'll hit a few.  The side that loads and shoots fastest wins, unless some whackjob has the huevos to try a bayonet charge.

By the time the Civil War rolled around, the US Army had adopted something called the Minié ball.  This projectile was conical with a hemispherical cup in the base.  The projectile is slightly smaller than the bore of the musket, which allows it to be rammed down even the foulest of barrels with ease.  Due to the hemispherical base, when the powder charge ignites, the base of the Minié ball expands, gripping the rifling and reducing windage (in this case, windage refers to the didtance between the bore and the projectile, not an aiming term).  Widespread use of rifled muskets and Minie ball ammunition meand that every single soldier can kill accurately at distances of 300 or more meters without sacrificing rate of fire, and volley fire is lethal at much greater range, simply due to probability.  The machinery of war had far outstripped the tactics.

With regard to WWII:

The key to the German's success was in coordination and communication.  The French at the time had the best tanks on the battlefield.  The Char-B1 tank outclassed any tank the Germans had.  Unfortunately for the French, most did not have radios, and they were also spread out to give the Infantry support.  The Germans had far more radios, and also massed their armor (Schwerpunkt) to give local superiority.
