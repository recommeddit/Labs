71697,best movies with a cool twist,"Snatch is my favorite, prolly somewhat better than Lock Stock"
8247,best toothpaste,"Toothpaste doesn't matter too much, as long as it isn't the hippie brand that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities. (You want fluoride)

Get a sonicare! The only problem is trying to travel light and going back to a regular toothbrush. Your teeth simply do not feel clean with a regular brush."
72413,best keyboard switches,"I use Kailh box jade thick clicks which have a pretty high actuation force needed for the keyboard to register that you actually pressed it. A lot of people dislike this, but I found that it has helped me tremendously with partial clicks/misclicks because I can stop myself in time and it doesn’t register that I hit it a little. If you’re looking to build I recommend the mechanical keyboard subreddit! Personally I find my switches on NovelKeys :)"

43759,best items under $100,"Same, but I bought it on summer sale. I think it was $5"
54759,best water filter,"Berkey is the way to go. I actually have an extra one if you're interested in buying used. I've had mine for about ten years and I replace the filters annually, although by some accounts on here that's even too often.

It is definitely the best cost/gal filter on the market and you can get filters to handle many kinds of water contamination, including heavy metals."
43551,best items under $100,"Fitted sheet straps. They keep cheap sheets from popping up at the corners. So now I can use soft sheets that don't cost a fortune and my sleep is undisturbed by them popping loose, greatly improving my quality of life."
3270,best webcamera,"The toolbox fallacy right there. Refusing to start doing things you want to do because you're ""missing"" something."
5069,best home improvement store,"I'm a contractor.  Home depot is more seeded within my working radius however I use both.  I am more familiar with Home Depot, their store layouts and their products.  On the occasion I go into Lowes, I find their layout seems to be more standardized.

I have a $12,500 credit limit with Home Depot and only $2,500 with Lowes, however as a Platinum PRO I get a 2.5% discount with Home Depot but I get 5% with Lowes.  I spend roughly $60,000 a year.

The return policies at both stores are about the same, but I can just use my card at Home Depot whereas I have to save my receipt to do returns at Lowes.  

Assistance (or lack thereof) isn't really an issue with me (lol I know more than you... aka Ron Swanson).  The HD app on my phone is useful but I've never checked to see if Lowes has one.

A decade ago, I had a conversation with my friend who convinced me to go independent and our conclusion was that Home Depot was best suited for the contractor however Lowes had better Designer options.

All stores have theft protocols.

I'm well accustomed to the automatic checkout with Home Depot however I do like the probability of having a human available at Lowes.  

End of the day, I use Home Depot more, but that's because there's one less than a mile away from my house on my path to most of my jobs.  I've got a lot of familiar strangers that I can say hi to when I start my day."

61960,Best RPG game on PS4,"Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.

Assassin's Creed Origins & Odyssey are action games with many RPG elements."
25028,best spiderman actor,Tom Holland is the most accurate portrayal of comic book Peter/Spidey.
14128,best place to get free books,"A) No idea, you could try hooking up a kindle to your computer and transferring the file?

B) Audiobookbay and Mobilism are two i think someone mentioned"
27918,best breakfast foods,we as a species really need to get our shit together and invent bacon juice already
27658,best bollywood actor,"Dialogue delivery - no one can beat older generations like meena kumari or waheeda rehman.

Facial expressions - jaya badhuri, rekha, madhuri, sridevi and of course madhubala.

Call me old fashioned, but honestly not one actress comes close to older ladies. Even if they weren't naturally good actors they were extremely dedicated and worked hard to bring out every little wrinkle and tick."
54249,best medicine for a cold,"The problem is that I wake up every two hours at night because I drink too much water. And If I don’t then I’ll wake up because my throat and nose are dry. 

I did get some very good dreams in those 2 hours though."
60620,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I did actually like that aspect of it, how things happening in the background started making sense later on. But apart from that, there really wasn't much to that season. The jokes and situations were often rehashed from earlier, better ones. But the biggest problem was that the thing that made the earlier seasons so great, the interaction between the various characters, was largely missing. 

That's why I liked the re-cut better. The interaction was still missing, but by not focusing entire episodes on one character, it created a better flow."
43429,best ad service for mobile applications,"Ah ok, yeah I think CPV may be the most comparable, but you would need to run them as a pre-roll, I think, and you would have to check with each ad network's terms of service for that.  Some video ad networks require ads to be shown ""moment based"" (at particular points in an app).

I'm not aware of this sort of thing being available outside of video ads.  And not all video ads are cpv.  Many are still cpi (per install).  Some networks focus on one model, some on the other.  As I mentioned before, the best bet is to integrate with a few different networks.  Ideally with mediation."
10111,best pencil for drawing,"Some days it'll suck. Somedays you'll dig it. A good teacher told me you don't need inspiration to do work, you need to do work to get inspired. Draw small, big, medium, tiny, depending on the media and paper. A small A6 or A5 block asks for small drawings, fine pens, medium pencils, get a A2 paper and charcoal and it's gonna be impossible not to go big. 

Filling up a page with dozens of little gesture drawings is as necessary as going big in a small detail. Try drawing your other hand as big as the paper, with all the wrinkles and valleys. It's a good training"
