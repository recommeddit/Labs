2791,I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??,best headphones

23777,"In general, IMO the Forza Horizon series and Forza itself are the best racing games this generation, but that's Xbox. 

On PS4, GT Sport is gorgeous and fun to play racer, it has a good selection of cars as well. This is one is definitely one of the best racers out right now. 

Project Cars 1 & 2  is geared more towards simulation and it also features a ton of cars and realistic locations. 

The Crew 1 & 2 is more like Forza Horizon, an open world racer with a lot of variety and you can race against other players. The first game is story driven, while the second one focuses solely on racing.  

Driveclub is an older title, but it's still a beautiful game and one of my all-time favorites. It has the best dynamic weather system around and it's cheap. 

I could go on, I love racing games as well and own most, if not all of them between the two consoles.",best car racing video game
55622,"Anything by Brandon Sanderson....if you're not sure, you can check out Warbreaker for free on his website.

Robin Hobb's Farseer Series (I'm actually getting ready to re-read that)

Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan) is great but probably not the best to start with since it is so long.

Kingkiller Chronicles (Patrick Rothfuss) is awesome but unfinished

Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks...I enjoyed it but have read mixed reviews about it.

And you can always check out /r/fantasy for more suggestions!",best action and adventure novel series
