24804,best anime,"Oh it isn’t canon at all, but it’s still around unfortunately, i personal don’t mind the story it tries to tell with the Baby arc..but that’s about all that’s good from a story perspective...music and art style is really nice though."
72923,best Linux distro,Please don't mention my past shame. Me from years ago is very sensitive.
48475,best color to paint with,Spanish Sand Behr.
29629,best game console,Socom 1 & 2 were my favorite games ever.  Nice list.
2791,best headphones,I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??
45604,best gaming system,"You can get up to Halo 4 on the 360, those are great games, Halo 3 and Reach are my favorites though 4 had some great multiplayer maps and game types as well.  Call of Duty Black Ops 1 & 2 are great games on the 360 as well.  Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel are good as well."
29613,best game console,Don't forget dragons dogma for the ps3.

9308,best toothpaste,Yes but that would be hard in the morning when you want to drink coffee ?
32951,best energy drink,That flavour will always have a special meaning to me. Kind of upset its not in Canada :(
7486,best laptop for general use,"Hey there, I havent shopped for a laptop since 2012, so I am long removed from the game. I had a dell, and bought a chromebook a couple of years ago and hate it. 

Do you have a good summary of each brand? Acer vs Asus vs Dell vs Lenovo etc?"
46186,best trick or treating candy,"Anything that’s not something you get all the time.  Halloween candy, for me, was all about getting the weird stuff."
15872,best sunglasses for fashion,What's your opinion on Oliver Goldsmith sunglasses?
57150,best water brand,"Culligan, because what size bottles do you get with aquafina or fiji?  1L?  And what does that cost you?  $2.50?  Rediculous!
    
I go with Culligan, 18.5L bottles for $5 or less."
2810,best headphones,"Because from everything I can see sound wise the flight s is the same as the flight the tuning shape is unchanged it just dropped a few dB making it a more listen able headset.

The white noise should be the same as the flight."

51833,best iphone case,"I have a question, will apple leather case for iPhone 12 get me through 3+ years which is how much time I am planning to use this phone for?"
28811,best breakfast foods,It turned out great. Almost like an apple cobbler but not as sweet. I forgot to add cinnamon but that or honey would be an awesome addition. It was a good dessert replacement.
12209,best gifts for dad,I actually love clothes because I hate even spending time shopping for them.  Amazon has helped some of that but not all of it.
35176,best NFL player,Nice edit.
12061,best gifts for dad,Oh my god. I am extremely buying this.
7440,best laptop for general use,This is the way
23777,best car racing video game,"In general, IMO the Forza Horizon series and Forza itself are the best racing games this generation, but that's Xbox. 

On PS4, GT Sport is gorgeous and fun to play racer, it has a good selection of cars as well. This is one is definitely one of the best racers out right now. 

Project Cars 1 & 2  is geared more towards simulation and it also features a ton of cars and realistic locations. 

The Crew 1 & 2 is more like Forza Horizon, an open world racer with a lot of variety and you can race against other players. The first game is story driven, while the second one focuses solely on racing.  

Driveclub is an older title, but it's still a beautiful game and one of my all-time favorites. It has the best dynamic weather system around and it's cheap. 

I could go on, I love racing games as well and own most, if not all of them between the two consoles."
55622,best action and adventure novel series,"Anything by Brandon Sanderson....if you're not sure, you can check out Warbreaker for free on his website.

Robin Hobb's Farseer Series (I'm actually getting ready to re-read that)

Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan) is great but probably not the best to start with since it is so long.

Kingkiller Chronicles (Patrick Rothfuss) is awesome but unfinished

Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks...I enjoyed it but have read mixed reviews about it.

And you can always check out /r/fantasy for more suggestions!"
