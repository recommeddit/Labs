"One part Scotch whisky.  

One part man up

Enjoy!"
Idk. Try some of the other websites people have mentioned in the comments
"I've neglected to thank you for this list. For that, apologies. Thank you so much. 

I discovered a mvno that does not deprioritize called Pulse Cellular and runs all three major networks. Pricey but perhaps a better deal than many post paid plans. 

Thans again."
"Henry Clay was really important towards the formation of the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850, which were negotiated to ease tensions between the North and South before the Civil War. Of course, we know that didn't work out, but he was still a very noteworthy politician for a very long period of American history."
More of a Yoo-hoo man myself.

Best series on Netflix
"Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive.

Say hello to modern day Tolkien.

ALSO

100% Try out The Name of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

Brandon's worldbuilding is the best I have ever read, and I read A LOT.

Enjoy whatever you choose to read next anyway!"
"Unless you're already listening to them I would certainly recommend you to give Månegarm, Thyrfing, Svartsot, Einherjer, Heljareyga, Trollfest and Alestorm a listen :)"

"I saw both in theaters, but was a little young when I saw Planet Of The Apes.   (It still blew my tiny little mind.)"
"Leela Palace New Delhi stands out for me. Spectacular room, excellent shower, and attentive service. Breakfast was great. Management were extremely accommodating and seemed more interested in creating a long term relationship over nickel and diming. The gym facilities and pool were also great. This hotel was built as a trophy property without full consideration to maximizing profit as seen by room size and amount. I have tried to adopt some of these customer service philosophies in my own business."
"I guess I just don’t notice it making that big of a difference. Yeah the true blacks are nice for watching video but outside of that, it doesn’t really wow me over the lcd. Its definitely not the huge difference like when looking at a big lcd to oled tv. At least for me"
If money were no issue I would have studied History
"I'm in high school right now, and am seriously  considering a dual business and agriculture degree. Would you know what the job prospects would be? And how difficult would it be to get a job in agriculture?"
I was wondering about these because they’re soooo cute and seem to be protective. I drop my phone HARD and often... do you think it holds up?
call the stores before you head out. Save yourself the trip.
"I'd say GPX, but there are mice coming out soon to match it's weight with arguably better shapes."
"I agree with strawboy that OP meant anniversary of his card, not his wedding."

"Learn to sip whiskey. It is a good skill to have, and if you drink water you are more likely to feel alright the next day."
I was hoping someone had recommended this. Shook me deep
"Doesn't matter how many packages you've installed, Sublime will always be a text editor, not an IDE."
"Mine have been opened on every recent trip where I checked bags, so I guess YMMV."
