The fact everything is so well laid out made it really simple for me to wrap my head around. Not just with the keys, but when looking at the grand staff, it all translates well. 

Plus it's just a beautiful instrument with a lot of amazing history. 

But if you just want to jam with friends, I know a lot of people who just pick up the guitar for this. Much easier to carry around and play pop songs with.",best instrument to play

Used to have AT&T and parts of the town I live in, a good chunk my commute and some of the places I go to hang out on weekends were all deadzones. 

Ended up switching to Xfinity because my girlfriend has had good experiences with them and I was able to get a bundle with the internet since I was also looking to get away from Uverse. The difference is like night and day.

Back where I used to live it was pretty much the opposite. AT&T was killer and Comcast was hit or miss depending on which street you were on.",best phone service company
66278,"Barcelona won the Cup Winners' Cup 4 times, no other team has managed to more than twice. This would definitely factor in when discussing European pedigree or dominance in general.  

Liverpool won the UEFA Cup 3 times, which was a joint-record until Sevilla won their 4th in 2015. Had they beaten Sevilla in 2016, they would both have 4 trophies in that competition.  

The Cup Winner's Cup was definitely a higher tier of competition than the UEFA Cup before it got absorbed into it. I'd personally rank Barcelona over Liverpool based on that alone, putting domestic dominance aside (where they'd still be above Liverpool).",best soccer team in the world

26182,"This is one really hard, not sure where to go here.

It'd have to be either Steve Beshear (D, fmr Governor of Kentucky) or Hal Rodgers (R, US Rep of Kentucky).  

Beshear was a great governor, loved by most of the state.  Expanded medicaid, had pretty much the best exchange in the country.  Would work with both sides of the aisle (which is a far cry from what we got now).

Hal Rodgers is (I think) the longest serving member in the House of Reps.  He was just elected to his 18th term.  He was chairman of the House Appropriations committee not sure if he still is.  Anyway, he really brings the pork back home.  He's really pushing to find solutions to the opioid.  problem, which hits hard in his region. The only thing I really don't like about him is he LOVES to name everything after himself.",best politician

2911,"Depending on the type of gaming you are doing there are a few options. Most have been covered  in this post (tygr 300, akg 712), however, I don’t see much here about the Sennheiser 599s. 

Personally I find the 599s to be excellent for shooters — their soundstage is incredibly large and full. It produces crisp footsteps that are not drowned out in the bass of gunfire and firefights will not stop you from pinpointing a single footstep given off by a lurker. 

For immersive Rpg/Arpg/Mmos I would recommend trying to hunt down the tygr 300r, as it will have a stronger ingame feel to it for these genres, however, the 599s will service you well in these types. 

I do not recommend the 599s for pop music, but they are excellent for classical, metal, rap, and rock.

As far as price tag goes, the 599 black model was 102 shipped and taxed on prime day a few weeks ago so you may find some great second hand deals on unopened ones. Otherwise, it still punches above its weight for its price class at its retail — personally I have the SE which are beige, but for my friends I got them the black models when they were on sale. 

Hopefully this helps in your journey! If you have more questions feel free to ask.

Edit: I forgot to add, the 599s will not need a DAC/Amp which is part of why I chose them, although they can certainly be juiced.",best headphones
