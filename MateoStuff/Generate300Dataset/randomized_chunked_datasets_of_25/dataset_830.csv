&#x200B;

[https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/533](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/533)

&#x200B;

We did use the suggested alternative, but it's just plain odd that you can only call an output function a single time only. I get that this is a function of the underlying impl being a stream, but from a ux perspective, it's poor.

That aside, there is no shortage of all inclusive resorts on islands surrounding wherever it is you are from.  If you happen to be from America: Belize, Puerto Rico (Culebra), and Mexico come to mind as particularly affordable areas that have 'resorts'.  Of course there is always Florida, S. Carolina, California, etc if you don't have a passport.",best vacation resort
