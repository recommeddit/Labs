28457,best breakfast foods,"Yea, Mountain Dew is pretty much the worst you can do to your teeth. Not only does it contain a cubic shitload of sugar, it also contains lots of acid. It's significantly worse than Coke which is already super terrible for your teeth."

32536,best vacation resort,"Lived in Cabo for 6 months. Not too sure about resorts, but have a bunch of people I could ask if you PM me, I like to wander/don't do the all inclusive thing. Weather wise, most of the year is fine, other than July-Early October is too hot for anything imo, and October-September is hot/rain/bugs. 

If you end up going:

-Make reservations at Salvatore's one night. (It's right downtown) Kick ass american chef retired there and runs it iirc. Super affordable and is probably the best food in cabo. 

-Take a day trip/water taxi to the semi secluded beach by the arch. Keep walking towards the arch after the tourist-y section (maybe a small amount of climbing depending on tide) Almost never anyone there, and it's incredible. Bring a camera...and a couple joints if you're into that type of thing and watch the tour boats go by. As long as you get back to the tourist spot before dark there is lots of water taxi's back.

-If you're both in to fishing/scuba diving etc, definitely do it. Make sure to haggle, w/e they quote you first is probably nonsense. 

-Pick a nice day, go bar hopping along the marina. Upgrade to decent tequila in your margaritas. :D

-Sunday brunch at mango deck is awesome. I desperately miss chilaquiles, and am tempted to fly back to Mex right now just thinking about them. Gets a bit wild if you stay past ~2 so keep that in mind."

27389,best stocks to buy,"COST, MSFT, MMM, AMD, SPXL (or VTI if you don't feel comfortable holding triple leverage).

COST: They're a titan in the retail space, and they have some excellent leadership. Very consumer focused. I expect them to be around for much longer. They don't have the profit margins of some tech companies but all I see when I drive by a location is packed parking lots.

MSFT: They not only have dividends but look at what deals they've been making this year. They signed a fat contract for VR headsets delivered to the Army. The military uses Microsoft's software for everything. Game pass on Xbox has been extremely successful. The Series X is actually competing with PlayStation this time around unlike the Xbox One. I truly believe MSFT is poised for more growth on top of maintaining their dominance in their sector.

MMM: 3M isn't a growth stock in my eyes, I'd hold them solely for the dividend simply put.

AMD: AMD, unlike Intel, doesn't have shitty leadership and is delivering in ways Intel can't. These last two years are indicative of that. Plus, they're very nice to run the options wheel on.

SPXL: I have massive balls and the returns are nuts. If it goes down? Oh well, DCA here I come. VTI is an excellent alternative for those who don't feel comfortable with triple leverage, and it's outperformed the S&P."
