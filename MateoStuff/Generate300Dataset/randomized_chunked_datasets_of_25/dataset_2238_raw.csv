Well you just opened a rabbit hole for me...
"I'm very late to this thread but here it goes. Two years ago I had an epiphany about Mother's Day. 

As a single mom to two young boys there's no one else to show them how to give me anything, no chance at a break, etc. It's always been a sore point for me. 

Then two years ago on Mother's Day I woke up... All moody an irritated, checked reddit and a woman posted a poem that had me in tears. It was written from the perspective of her twins... Twins that were dead and how she was still a mom even though they weren't there. I cried so hard, woke up my sons and snuggled them close. 

Mother's Day is no longer about celebrating me.... It's now about  celebrating how lucky I am to be a Mom. How much I love my sons and what a joy it is to have them in my life. 

All I want for mother's day is to spend time with my children. There are too many mothers who don't get that simple pleasure any more."

"I'm in a similar situation.  I have my slate of authors I really enjoy.  I actually got into a sort of a bubble where I return to those authors or go back to classics.  When I came across a review that focused more on the author's characteristics than the work, I mentally put that author into my ""do not read; life is too short for this"" bucket.  However, when I started buying supporting membership for Worldcon, just to get access to the nominated works, I was very pleasantly surprised with some of the works.  The nominations are definitely skewed towards authors I would normally not consider reading (partly because of reviews of their works that spend more time on their race, gender and sexual orientation than the quality of their books), but thanks to them I discovered writers like Jemisin, Kowal, Chambers and McGuire, whose works I largely enjoy.  I also discovered plenty of nominees whom I'll ignore in the future, but that's the price I'm willing to pay."

"That was a good read, thanks for the link."
"The native http module is a lower level API requiring you to write more code to accomplish common tasks. For example, reading a json body response and parsing it requires you to listen to the `'data'` event stream, concatenate the chunks and then calling `JSON.parse()`. With `node-fetch` it's just `res.json()`."
"Almost anything is infallible compared to the DM, to be honest."
"> Soap & Water > Hand Sanitizer. Just a friendly reminder.

Hospitals and health care facilities are big on antibacterial agents, and they also pose a huge risk for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ([MRSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus)) infections. At the moment, MRSA is more dangerous than AIDS, and the best way to get infected is to *visit a hospital*.

The reason? Antibacterial agents, widely and carelessly used in such things as hand soap, promote evolution in bacteria, which end up completely resistant to commonly used antibacterial agents.

The problem is that people only think of an immediate goal -- disinfecting someone's hands -- but fail to pay attention to the big picture, which is evolution. It's not just fundamentalists that fail to understand and respect evolution -- doctors do it all the time.

Just a friendly reminder."
I just use Soylent... no prep and fully healthy meal. You can also stare at people while casually sipping it if a certain joke comes up about it
"I wouldn’t say so at all. In Naples, FL it is abundantly clear that Verizon is the winner and the vast majority of people I know have switched to Verizon or already had it."
A few years back my moms address book was falling apart so I got her a nice new leather one and copied over all the address information into it so she wouldn't have to.
"No point in $280 1660 Ti since 1660S has basically the same perf for ~$250. For $300 I would go for a 2060 first but if a 5700 with a non-stock cooler was available I’d see if my case had room for it (they are pretty large) and just hope the drivers improved over time. If you aren’t interested in that, just find a 2060 on sale."
"That is a garbage list. Those novels are old, boring, and super outdated in today's world. 

And seriously, who younger than 50 years old actually reads books that old?"
"I assume the filters are probably about the same regardless of brand so you may as well go w/ the least expensive option. I have a 5 stage Water General RO-585 filter which has worked well on our nasty well water for a couple years now. $143 at filter direct. http://filterdirect.com/index.php?cPath=22

Edit- the way it works is it adds a 2nd spout (probably at your kitchen sink for drinking water). It takes most of the minerals and hopefully any contaminates out of the water and it tastes just like a bottle of water you would buy at the store."
"Also, most of the multi-book series only get one line while the *Ender's* books each get their own. The first two, at least, are a pair."
"Ugh. I love the concept, and I’ve tried them and similar cups but I must have a weird vagina because I don’t get good results and i only have a couple more years of periods to go so I’ve sort of given up. Quarantine took all the pressure off."

"I would recommend Mopub's mediator.  They are not ban happy like admob is.  You can use many networks server to server or via html tags.

Other than performance, which varies for everyone, you also want to consider:  
1)payout delay  
2)payout minimum

Most of the following copied from me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1ijrjc/admob_account_suspended_for_no_apparent_reason/)

Tapit .. avoid. I finally got paid 5 months late after sending about 20 emails. net60/$100  
Jumptap.. not bad, but payout terms are net90/$100  
Hunt.. took 6 months to approve my account (They supposedly specialize in Latin America) Trying them out now, but can't find their payout terms anywhere.  (I've quit using them bc fill rate is terrible even if targeted)  
Mobfox.. not great, not bad. Just another basket to keep my eggs in. payout terms are net45/$50  
Mojivia.. Tried to register with them, but I used to use Mobclix, so I can't 'double register'  
Millinial Media.. decent. payout terms are net60/$15 after you reach an initial $50. requires native SDK which is somewhat large.  
Chartboost.. I think that they only have intersatials. I looked into setting them up awhile back, but it was really confusing, so I just gave up.  
Lifestreet.. starting using them awhile back and have been pretty impressed. Payout terms are net14/$10. They pay each week.. so you wait no more than 3 weeks.  
InMobi.. deplorable performance. Maybe it's just me. Edit: they have gotten better lately.  
Appbrain.. Requires SDK. They always pay me within 10 days of month's end.  
Applovin.. requires SDK. They were okay for awhile. Always paid about 2 weeks after months end (net15).  
Tap for Tap.. requires SDK, nothing special. They pay quick but not enough IMO.  
Leadbolt.. I'd say that this is my 2nd favorite behind LifeStreet. They always pay in the middle of the next month (net15). Please Consider using my [referral link](http://www.leadbolt.com/advertisers_signup.php?ref=10040531) if you sign up. To add them, just create a custom Mopub network and paste your tag from leadbolt in there. Leadbolt approval is automated and generally takes an hour (A bot checks the market for your app. Note that names must match. ""My Cool App"" != ""My cool app"")  
Smaato - Just started trying them because they have tags. net60 min $1  
Edit:formatting"
Popsicles and mint tea sounds great actually!

Every CS major I know irl says the job pays great but is boring/tedious af.  Some of them get mental projects on short timelines too.
