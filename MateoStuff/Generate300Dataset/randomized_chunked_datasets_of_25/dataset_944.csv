67660,axios alternatives reddit,"Same here. I don't get why people use axios in the frontend. In node with no fetch, I MIIIGHT understand, but even then request/request-promise is perfectly enough."

10503,best suitcase lock,If you open them using the tsa key it changes color. If you shove two tools in there and twist it does not. So i guess i would say access but both really bc technically it is a tamper evident device.

Most likely the country you are from."
68382,best science fiction novel,"Perhaps he suffers from the fact that no-one can agree on his best book. There isn't a standout single book that everyone recommends.

46400,best trick or treating candy,"Leave the porch light on; that is the sign that you are handing out candy. Leave the door open if you don't want the bell ringing every thirty seconds. There is nothing wrong with handing out one or two pieces per kid, although if it is a really good kid or especially good costume, I will give a little extra. Don't leave the bowl outside, and don't offer them the bowl unless you are prepared to be a dick when they inevitably try to take advantage of you.

If/when you run out of candy, just turn off your porch light/unplug any Halloween lights, close your door, and leave a nice note saying something like ""Sorry, out of candy. See you next year!"" Most kids will just pass by when they see paper on the door. I live in a pretty nasty neighborhood, and I have never had problems with TPing or egging or anything, but keep any pets inside tomorrow and Monday. People can get nasty around Halloween.

Have fun!"
