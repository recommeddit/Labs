34323,best NFL player,Yeah Diggs at 8 after what he did last year is a bit surprising to me too. Especially since he now gets a full offseason program with Josh. I figured he should be 4 or 5 as well.

13524,best research paper archive,"Many academics are not well-versed in what they are and are not allowed to do, via copyright law. Matters are further complicated by the fact that each journal's contract is a bit different in its restrictions. I imagine two different things are happening for you. 1) Authors do not want to share for fear of reprimand for overextending copyright law. 2) Many academic authors just don't have time to add on ""e-mailing the general public"" to their list of already long duties that include teaching, research, and service commitments."

65329,best phone service company,Also coverage maps don’t reflect speed or quality of service. It just means you should get a signal there. Now if it’s a usable signal or not is a different story.

22737,best celebrity,"Dave Chappelle has a history of running very long comedy shows. My buddy and I saw one of his shows a while back. It ran very very late, until almost 4am (on a weekday), by the end, almost the entire crowd had trickled out- to get up early for work the next day and what not. Only about a dozen of us remained at the show by this point. Dave invited us to all play basketball with him the next afternoon. He had rented out an entire gym for an hour. Of course my buddy and I took him up on the offer. We played pick up hoops with Dave Chappelle for over an hour. After everyone finished playing, a handful of us stuck around and shot the shit with Dave. He bought us all fruit smoothies and gave us free tickets to his show the next night. SUPER nice guy, just like he is on TV. Couldn't have been any cooler"

33715,best electric car,"i'd probably be the worst candidate to get an e-vehicle just because i'm the kind of guy who forgets to charge his phone and is running on less than 20% for half the day. Charging tech would really have to advance to the point where it's faster to plug-in & juice up than to refill the tank at a standard gas station to be viable in my mind. I guess i'm a creature of habit and really hate adjusting my lifestyle and routine to new tech. I want gadgets to work & conform to my schedule, not the other way around."
