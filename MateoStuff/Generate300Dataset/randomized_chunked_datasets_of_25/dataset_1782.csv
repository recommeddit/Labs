39636,best podcast for biologists,"Just in the past two years, I started listening to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe.  It's not specifically a biology podcast- it hits all science topics but if you want to become a PA, they talk a LOT about fraudulent alternative medicine practices.  I'm an optometrist and have learned a great deal.  Not too much of it specifically applies to my field but when someone brings up a pseudoscientific treatment, I'm much more confident and successful at talking them out of it."

44110,best items under $100,"I have to be honest, that sounds kind of nasty, and a bit high maintenance.  I'm not sure if I'd actually be able to tell the difference between food cooked in a seasoned cast iron skillet and food cooked in a brand new steel skillet, or between food cooked in a cast iron skillet with three generations of seasoning and food cooked in a cast iron skillet that's been seasoned recently with oil.  I have a small cast iron skillet (seasoned according to the manufacturer's directions) that I use rarely because it's so damned heavy and because it tends to heat unevenly, resulting in scorch marks that are difficult to remove."
