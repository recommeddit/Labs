5729,"I highly recommend Sass. In my experience even though I learnt CSS, JavaScript and HTML, I didn't really have any clue on how companies actually made use of these technologies and how they fit together in the overall picture.

It was only after I did some lessons on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [CodeSchool](http://mbsy.co/7Crq3) did I figure out these technologies from a practical point of view. Specifically, check out the [Start up Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/course/startup) course on Coursera and Assembling Sass (part 1 and 2), JavaScript courses on Code School.

If you are comfortable with JavaScript, I'd suggest you to get familiar with frameworks like Jquery, Ember.js, Backbone.js, Node.js, and Coffeescript. Most startups that I have worked with extensively use these. There are plenty of video tutorials on Youtube for these frameworks but I found [Code School's](http://mbsy.co/7Crq3) Learn by Doing approach worked very well for me. Also, it'll help you immensely if you are comfortable with Git, Github and Chrome Developer tools as they are pretty much used everywhere.

8722,"Well, sensitivity can be linked with several problems from damaged enamel (causes the exposure of Dentin tubules. That makes cold and sweet sensitivity) to cavities or periodontal diseases like gingivitis. For your question about enamel, flouride in toothpaste is helping you to prevent the loss of enamel from acid erosion by creating powerful covalent bonds apetide molecules which is more powerful than -OH covalent bonds. So it does not help you to regenerate your enamel but saliva itself helps you to regenerate your enamel. 
For simple enamel damage: this one may caused by lots of things from hard brushing to not brushing or consuming lots of acidic nutrients. Sensitivity solving toothpastes basically helps to plug Dentin tubules and solves sensitivity but within a month or so. My tip for a faster solution is after brushing your teeth wait with the foam made with brushing of toothpaste for ten minutes before washing your mouth. With that you can make your tubules exposed with the plugging particles more than usual brushing and can have a faster solution.
For periodontal diseases: you should start to brush your teeth from gingiva to your teeth. I'm warning you it will bleed and feel swelling but that shouldn't prevent you from doing it because it's a paradoxical less you brush more painful it becomes. Don't make aggressive brushing be gentle to your teeth.
P.S.: you should see a professional no matter what because neither these solutions will solve your problem completely nor I can examine your situation. And in Dentistry early solutions are always cheaper and less painful.
Best of luck ðŸ¤ž",best toothpaste

Now if you wanna list actual reasons then go for it, but the difference  between stating a fact that something is shit, and an opinion that ""I think"" something is shit, is that there are unarguable flaws with the thing that make it terrible.",movies like Inception
30414,"I always felt the difference that made the biggest effect was that they didn't tax the fuck out of Germany the second time. Because the Treaty of Versailles demanded Germany pay back Europe, inflation rose to the point where it was cheaper to burn your money than to buy firewood. 1 us dollar to 1 billion marks. It was ridiculous, and one can only expect for the people to be angered and want to get back some money by getting back some of their land. This Europe thought was fine for a bit, but then Germany got too greedy, and they drew this unexpected line at Poland. Germany didn't expect Europe to react as intense as they did with Poland (since they hadn't done anything before that when they were taking stuff over) and so were a tad surprised when a world war broke out again. 
All in all, pretty much everyone made terrible mistakes after WWI


Edit: Also, I thought it was really unfair that Germany got so much blame for the first world war, when they didnt' even start it. It seemed to me like Europe used Germany as a scape goat to try and recover for the war",best Mexican war to study
