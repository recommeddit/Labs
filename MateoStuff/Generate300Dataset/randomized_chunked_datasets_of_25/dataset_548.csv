46934,best hand santizer brand,">What about your own cells? like mucous membranes?    
    
Tissue at the cellular level is not much different from bacteria so yes, some of it does get affected. As I understand it, the tissues are more tightly packed together and regenerate much quicker so it's usually not a problem.  It will become a problem if you swish with alcohol more than recommended.

44453,best items under $100,"If you are going to spend on nice knives, when it comes to knife sharpening I’d highly suggest either really learning how to do it with stones / grinders, or actually having them professionally sharpened every year or so. It makes a world of difference to have truly proper geometry I don’t believe there are any reasonable consumer sharpeners out there.  If you’re just using cheap knives, a cheap sharpener woo get you back to sharper than dull - but I haven’t seen many people very happy with just buying a sharpener and sharpening their own knives especially once they compare them to a correctly sharpens knife. 

Between uses stropping should get you back to razor sharp if the original sharpening was done well."

4703,best home improvement store,"To be fair, basic hookup like water and electrical are usually included with the delivery. More complicated appliances like dishwashers or appliances with gas hookups are usually charged extra.

For Lowes, you need to contact the specific store and make an appointment for a subcontractor for another ~$70 or whatever they charge.  
Whereas with Home Depot, you can checkout online and tack on installation with a $20 checkbox.

When I bought my Bosch dishwasher from Lowes, they gave me a generic power cord instead of the proper one I paid for & I had to run around to get an electrical fitting on top of that."
