54611,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hi there! Thanks for the comment, I've really enjoyed helping people pick a good pad!


For your situation, you seem to want a middle ground for tracking and stopping. Raiden and otsu v2 are both great alternatives to the hien if you want to try something else. I'm leaning towards saying otsu v2 in soft or xsoft as it will give you nearly the same tracking capability as the hien, with a touch more stopping power and a very unique and fun surface! 


On the flip side, if you want a bit more tracking the Raiden is really great, but I'd recommend mid for Raiden as I hear xsoft negates the speed benefits a bit. Raiden doesn't stop as great, but it's really fun!


Both are really awesome, but the direct answer to your question is otsu v2, the speedy fun solution is Raiden 👍."

39519,best web browser,"> Mozilla Firefox - I think Firefox doesn't need any special introduction. :)

Of course it doesn't.

> Brave - Built on Chromium engine so it's compatible with all extensions from the Google Web Store.

The one reason I would never recommend this browser to anyone. It's basically a ""flavor"" of Google, meaning you're still supporting the tech giant and it's browser monopoly, which is bad because it gives Google too much power and complete control of the internet. There will be no more freedom, no more choice, and no more privacy.

> Tor - the big daddy of private browsing. Also your gate to the deep web.

But there's no built-in adblock (except on Tails), and you can't install an addon because that would ruin your anonymity. Just use Tails and all your problems will go away.

> Pale Moon - open source, very lightweight

I should probably remain silent before I end up starting another FFox vs PM war against the ptio staff.

> WaterFox - the ""old"" ""pre-Quantum"" Firefox, with new features and updates.

Also had some privacy issues so I don't recommend.

> Midori - open source, lightweight browser

That nobody ever uses and won't ever use since compared to other browsers, this one is useless.

> Falkon - this is a simple, open source, lightweight browser + it's a KDE project. No privacy concerns here.

Never tried it

> Vivaldi - for those who really like customization! They claim to collect no user data, only what you explicitly decide to share with them.

That claim is a lie, and Vivaldi does spy on you (though not as much as Firefox), and it doesn't even let you disable all the spyware features. It's essentially Chrome with customization. Vivaldi was created because some Opera devs didn't like the switch from Presto to Chromium and some other things, but Vivaldi uses the Chromium engine itself instead of using Firefox's engine or their own custom one. It's customization and features do make it a somewhat decent choice, but still not recommended.

GNU IceCat isn't allowed yet somehow Midori, Falkon, and Vivaldi all make the cut.

Now let's take a look at your search engines:

> DuckDuckGo - my default search engine for over an year now. Very powerful, efficient and user friendly.

Which is also based in the United States and runs on Amazon servers. DuckDuckGo has also violated it's privacy policy before. [Don't believe me?](https://archive.is/qntuk) And the best thing about this proprietary search engine is it's founder, Gabriel Weinberg, used to run a social network (names database) designed to collect lots of personal data from users. Still think DDG is safe?

> SearX - combined power of many search engines, just without collecting your data

And unlike the other search engines you listed, this one is completely open source, and many instances exist. Neocities has an interesting one that redirects you to a random instance known to work, while not using any instances that spy on you or use cloudflare. Privacytools.io's instance uses Matomo for user tracking and analytics. Let's see what kind of data so-called ""privacy""tools is collecting from us.

*top keywords and search engines, websites, social media websites, top page URLs, page titles, user countries, providers, operating system, browser marketshare, screen resolution, desktop VS mobile, engagement (time on site, pages per visit, repeated visits), top campaigns, custom variables, top entry/exit pages, downloaded files, and many more*

A full list of instances can be found [here](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Searx-instances).

> Ecosia - search and help plant trees. Very interesting project.

but doesn't really offer much in terms of privacy.

> StartPage - basically Google search with only the good stuff, without trackers or collecting private data.

Which is why I don't recommend it. Google runs a massive censorship campaign, aiming to remove all ""fake news"" or ""extremist"" content from their search. Don't believe me? Search for some alt-right conspiracy theory on Google, then search the exact same thing on Bing. Compare the results."

66757,best soccer team in the world,">England does have a lot of valuable players now who. Gomez, Maguire, Trent, Walker, AWB, James, Shaw, Rice, Phillips, Mount, Hendo, Bellingham, Foden, Saka, Sancho, Graelish, Rashford, Sterling, Tammy and Kane. There are still plenty more who are worth a bit.

Gomez, Phillips, Tammy, AWB and the like would hardly be as valuable if they weren't English.

Some of those players are undoubtedly brilliant but others are considered better than they are because they play in a league which is generally watched more"
