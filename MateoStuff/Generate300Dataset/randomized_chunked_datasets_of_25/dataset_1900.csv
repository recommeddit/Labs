46268,">    How many pieces of candy do I hand out per kid? Does it change based on age?

One or two of ""fun size"" is acceptable, if you only have a few kids in your neighborhood it can be nice to just get a couple ""king size"" or normal  sized candy bars/packages.  If you're up for it, give bonus candy for good jokes.




>    Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

Whichever you're comfortable with.  I usually keep only some of the candy in a bowl and allow them to pick a few pieces.  For small children, put it in their bags (They have a hard enough time telling you a joke).


>    I've purchased about 250 pieces of candy (good stuff like mini versions of starburst, snickers, almond joy, butterfingers, etc). Is this enough?

You are the best kind of house.  Mix them together and fill your bowl as needed.  You'll be fine with that much (it'll last a few hours in most places)


>    I'm too lazy to decorate or dress up. But how do I make it clear I'm giving out candy? Just turn on the lights and keep door open?

turn on the lights, makes sure you're well lit.  People will come if there is light.  Theres no need to dress up.

>    How long do I have to stand by the door? I was thinking 5-8 pm.


Most places have a set time for ticker treating.  Usually ending at 9, but you can do it for however long you want.

>    What happens do I run out of candy? How do I prevent people from TPing my house?


Turn off your light.  People usually only TP people they know, and for the most part, people don't TP that much anymore.  TP is too expensive now :p",best trick or treating candy

60262,"I wrote about this in another thread posted on preppers but can't find it. SO TLDR from that

Focus on purchasing a 7 Foot freezer if you can. Affordability wise it's the best bang for your buck. 7 Foot freezers should be about 200-300, the ones I saw on amazon and best buy were 229.   
I purchased 1 of the last 5 foot chest freezers in my area around a month or 2 months ago at my home depot. which could go anywhere around 150-250.   
People weren't discussing it here but it was a hot commodity people were buying in silence.

The brands that I saw had the highest rating were Insignia, midea and magic chef. But wherever you do purchase it, just read the majority of reviews, assuming the chest freezers are even still available. Try to get one that has a 1 year warranty (Most do). Good luck.",best freezer brand
