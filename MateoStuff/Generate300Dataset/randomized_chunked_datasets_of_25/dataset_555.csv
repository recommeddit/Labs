There are no wrong major if your goal is to be a physician ( kinda funny seeing op say ""MD money"" when DO make just as much). GPA/MCAT trumps all 

And since we're in /r/finacialindependence, we might as well talk about the opportunity cost.

First of all, you have to get into a medical school. If you want to match into psychiatry, a damn good one at that. Many people don't get on their first try (average age is 24). 

Then you have to through medical school which is a grueling 4 year. And you better push yourself pretty hard because you want to match into psychiatry. If you can't match into psych... you better be happy with the other specialties. 

Okay so let's say you grades are good enough to get yourself matched into psych. Guess what. There's 4 more additional years of training until you're a full-fledged psychiatrists. And oh yeah, medical school is expensive.

I just realised I miscalculated the age of the fanfic writers. Since fan fiction as we know it started primarily with underground star trek slash fiction networks (it's actually a fascinating history, they had to find ways to connect and share in the 60s and 70s when sharing those stories and the explicitly gay erotic art wasn't legal and they had to hand copy their stories multiple times because there were no computers and printers) around the first series and the women in question were usually starting around their 20s, the fan fic writers/authors I'm thinking of would actually be around 70-80 now. They're still often active in the fan fic communities, though they aren't super visible because we all make assumptions.",best romantic novel

29064,"TickTick has calendar with possibility to arrange tasks, hide completed tasks, hide future repeat cycles and hide subtasks. You can also filter the view, so you can create custom list (filter) called ""Only today tasks"" set the logic ""Show today tasks"" and in your calendar click on ""View"" - ""Only today tasks"" list.  It will be still ""weekly view"" but only ""today"" tasks will be showing, so it's a nice workaround.

Edo Agenda has feature called Journal that consists of left panel -simple calendar, central panel - journal and right panel - to do. I am not sure of the dragging feature tho.

12412,"It involves going to a mine and purchasing buckets of dirt.  The dirt is planned in a screen and rocked, bounced,  and rotated in a trough of water. The sapphires, being the heaviest stone will migrate to the bottom, center portion of the screen if done properly.  The screen is flipped so the bottom material is on top.  The screen is lifted and collection begins.  Collection involves using a set of giant tweezers and picking the sapphires out and placing in a tube with a diaphragm on top.  Just push the stones into the tube and when you are done. You take them into the shop to be inspected, sorted, and  graded. You then have the opportunity to send them for heat treating (if needed) and faceting. 

I went to Gem Mountain Mine in Phillipsburg MT. I've been back a few times since. There are other moves through out MT. Their procedures, in terms of dirt/gravel collection vary but the process is similar",best gifts for mom
