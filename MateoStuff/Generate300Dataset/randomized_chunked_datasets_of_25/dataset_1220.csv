In Home Depot, I get people asking me if they can help me find something, which is awesome.

70477,"English here!

Best: Class discussions are incredible, reading materials are almost always fascinating, essay prompts are generally fresh and interesting and allow for you to write more creatively than in other majors.  Additionally, an understanding of how literature is created is helpful if you enjoy creative writing, and the skills you learn in English translate indirectly into many different fields.

Worst: God the career choices after graduation are awful, and there's really no room for error if you want to work within your field.  You can't go into an English major with a ""C's get degrees"" kind of outlook, because if you want to make it in this field you absolutely need to set yourself apart and give 110%.  You probably won't have much luck with just a bachelor's degree unless you flex your connections.  Even a master's degree might not get you very far outside of teaching, and you'll probably need a PhD to work in academia.",best major to study in college
