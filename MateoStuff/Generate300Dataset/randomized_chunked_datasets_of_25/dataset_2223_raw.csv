"What do you hate about it?

The 27GN950 has a semi-gloss screen. It's way clearer than the typical matte coating on most monitors."
Agreed. Rocking baby while playing Plants vs Zombies. Makes early morning/late nights doable.
I don't bother. Pick up the hobby of lockpicking and you'll realize you can open a TSA lock in a few seconds with minimal practice.
I would. I currently go to dvc.
I disagree he was the worst Spider-Man ever

"That I've played would be FO4 or Witcher 3. That I know but don't own would be Skyrim remastered, DQ11, and FFX/X-2 remastered."
"But Kluivert wasn't a starter. Rijkaard played as a DM/CB like he always did in his last Ajax spell.

EDIT: Found this site: https://timhi.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/ajax-1995/ You can see OP's pic as well as the tactics when Ajax played Milan in the CL group stage of the 94-95 season. We played them 3 times that season, won all 3 of them. So maybe that's where the confusion comes from?"
"Like anime? Maybe go back a bit further and watch *Uresei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer* directed by Oshi Mamoru (Ghost in the Shell, Twilight Q2) and written by Rumiko Takahashi (Ranma, Inu Yasha)-- it may help to watch an episode or two of the TV series to understand the characters. All available on youtube."
...so you can have another kid?
The average r/soccer user is an American Manchester Utd fan actually.
"With pretty limited info on how you use your cables, it's hard to say what to do differently exactly. But, what I do differently from my past is I basically don't use my phone while it's charging. If I need to do something, I'll just unplug it and plug it back in when I'm done. Also, if I do use it while charging, I just do my best to be careful around the end of the cable, no bending of the cable unless it like 4 or so inches away from the end. If the cable is long enough, I'll hold the the cable against the back of the phone in my hand so the bend is like 4-6 inches up the cable, and the end coming out of my phone is straight for at least an inch and a half or so.

There are a bunch of tiny string like wires soldered to individual pins on the plug, if it gets bent next to the plug, eventually the tiny copper just breaks off the pin and the cable is trash unless you resolder. That's the main point you need to be careful of, on both ends of the cable.

Also: I always plug and unplug cables holding the head, never pulling the cable out of my phone by pulling the actual cord, only while holding the end piece."

I think that’s what makes Australia the best ever in this scenario. Can’t think of another nation that can you argue has a GOAT spinner & GOAT pace bowler.
"Paco Rabanne Invictus, Bath and Body Works(yes them) Midnight, and believe it or not Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue which is just an aftershave."
"Witcher 3, HorizonZD, Dead Island/Skyrim."
Doesn't the Leaf have that?
"You put a backpack through that abuse, you find it's still good and you are surprised they offer a lifetime warranty?"

"In Texas at least, it’s taught that upon the annexation of Texas, American soldiers were fired upon by a Mexican patrol in the disputed land between Texas and Mexico, This would then escalate into the Mexican-American war"
"My Lowe's doesn't have self-checkout and there's usually only one register open.

I go to Home Depot."
Okay I was actually considering reading this! The film adaptation was ruined for me by Armie Hammer :x
"Ubuntu. Mate probably, but I like standard better. Do NOT install anything but 18.04 because of the support side of things, at least until you get your feet wet. If you want to go down the dark side later, fine, but get your feet wet on something solid and stable."
"Forza Motorsport 6 and Forza Horizon 3 for just plan run, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars for simulation

You can download Forza 6: Apex for free. Its the F2P - gutted version of Forza 6 and it should be able to let you get a feel for how the game is and it runs really well IMO.

You'll have to get Forza through the Windows App store though. Apex is PC only, Forza 6 through the App Store has an Xbox Only version, and a ""Play Anywhere"" version where you play on PC and Xbone. Get the Play Anywhere version."
I cannot underscore enough how amazingly well Ken Burns' The Civil War is done.  Phenomenal piece.
