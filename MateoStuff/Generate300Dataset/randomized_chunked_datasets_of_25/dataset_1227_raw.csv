">If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options. 

How would that work when there is a 1m+ long cable? I mean where does that go, how do you ""convert"" I guess a wired to a wireless?"

Not quite what you're asking, but 'average joe' isn't usually included on survey forms."
Exactly! I loved rewatching it. Definitely holds up on its own.

"Home Depot seems to be marginally cheaper than Loweâ€™s, at least when Iâ€™ve compared prices online before going to the store. Lowes employees tend to be more helpful."
On this we can agree. It just left me wanting more from the main roster. I surprisingly agree with Complex on that one
"VSCoders (looking at you, u/CalcProgrammer1 and u/pnutjam), have you tried [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)?

From what I understand it's exactly the same, but without the 'Microsoft customization' (whatever that means). I'm not a FLOSS/FOSS purist, so it doesn't really matter that much to me - just wondering how it compares to the 'official' product. A few of my Windows-only friends swear by VSCode, so I might give that a shot :)"
Iâ€™m intrigued
"Any news on when its coming out? 

Found the CX48 for Â£998 on QVC and I almost paid for it yesterday but 48 inches just pushes the limits on the amount of space i have for it. I may still go for it if LG dont release the 42 inch by May-June as im impatient and the cx48 is still great but 42 would be optimal for me"

"There was a pretty decent (in my opinion) ""sequel"" to Gone With the Wind, written by a different author.  It's called ""Scarlet"" and I really liked it.  The same author has another book, ""Rhett Butler's People"", too, which is on my list to read."
"That's a good point, but when I watched the new Winnie the Pooh movie last summer, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Pooh is kind of a dick"". He was being so mean to Piglet! And I had intended to watch that movie to relive all the cute childhood memories, but at the end I just wanted to hug Eeyore and put duct tape over Pooh's mouth."

"Honestly, I think the 10600K/F is a better bet right now than the 11400/F. It's only like $20 more right now, beats it by a bit stock, and beats it by a larger margin when overclocked. Even if you don't want to spend the extra money on a K board, you can always just unlock the power limits on a B560 board and get most(ish) of the benefits still."
"This may be of interest too.

HUA is TN.
Viv 'only' averaged 50 and some would argue that isn't good enough for an all time xi. Viv was only just edged out in my team by Sangakara who's averaging 58 career and something like 70 in 70 tests as a specialist batsman. That's just to good to ignore.
"Sony MDR-7506. Cheaper than the ATH-M50x, and just as good, if not better."
