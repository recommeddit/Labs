3454,"I think these mixed college rankings are misguided. Any ranking will make subjective judgement of what makes a college ""good"". Popular rankings give methodologies from which you can figure out what they value in colleges. If you combine multiple rankings, you lose clarity on what the ranking considers ""good"". It makes it hard (or impossible) to know what it means for a college to be above another college in the ranking. 

If you make a ranking, you should say exactly what metrics go into the ranking. I doubt you can do that here.",best college for research

56217,Western genre basically have action and great narrative. John Ford and Sergio Leone are known for developing art house Westerns that blends in great narrative and action. Then we have George Miller’s Mad Max films which combines the artsy stuff and action. I believe Stallone’s First Blood part 1 was basically a art house action film.,best action and adventure movie
40970,"> Classical strings dont have any note indicators or frets which leads to the problem you mentioned above. The layout of these instruments is much friendlier though.

You make it sound like they're easier than guitar!  

Firstly, the question of the ""layout"" is debatable - I'd say the frets make guitar easier, although the mixed tuning (4ths and one 3rd) gets confusing for patterns.   
But the main thing with classical strings is the *bowing*.  That's a lot harder to learn just hitting the strings with your fingers (or a pick).   Violin in particular sounds terrible while you're learning - a combination of poor intonation and clumsy bowing - while guitar's frets mean at least you can play in tune (if not in key...).

There's also an argument for guitar that its fretboard is a better guide for how intervals and scales work (up one string) than a keyboard, with its misleading white-black distinctions.  Otherwise, piano is obviously a lot easier technically; and bigger range and better for theory.  (And the white-black distinction is at least historically informative, as well as perfectly suited to staff notation.)
