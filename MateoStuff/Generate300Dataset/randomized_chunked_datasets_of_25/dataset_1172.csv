53447,best usb c charging cable,"I have used the magnetic USB c/micro USB charging cables for years. The ones that plug into the bottom of the phone and connect magnetically like the old magsafe charger on Macs.


I'd generally agree with this statement, though. The wall chargers are horrific, so I can imagine the cables are also bad."

3454,best college for research,"I think these mixed college rankings are misguided. Any ranking will make subjective judgement of what makes a college ""good"". Popular rankings give methodologies from which you can figure out what they value in colleges. If you combine multiple rankings, you lose clarity on what the ranking considers ""good"". It makes it hard (or impossible) to know what it means for a college to be above another college in the ranking. 

If you make a ranking, you should say exactly what metrics go into the ranking. I doubt you can do that here."

56217,best action and adventure movie,Western genre basically have action and great narrative. John Ford and Sergio Leone are known for developing art house Westerns that blends in great narrative and action. Then we have George Miller’s Mad Max films which combines the artsy stuff and action. I believe Stallone’s First Blood part 1 was basically a art house action film.
40970,best instrument to play,"> Classical strings dont have any note indicators or frets which leads to the problem you mentioned above. The layout of these instruments is much friendlier though.

You make it sound like they're easier than guitar!  

Firstly, the question of the ""layout"" is debatable - I'd say the frets make guitar easier, although the mixed tuning (4ths and one 3rd) gets confusing for patterns.   
But the main thing with classical strings is the *bowing*.  That's a lot harder to learn just hitting the strings with your fingers (or a pick).   Violin in particular sounds terrible while you're learning - a combination of poor intonation and clumsy bowing - while guitar's frets mean at least you can play in tune (if not in key...).

There's also an argument for guitar that its fretboard is a better guide for how intervals and scales work (up one string) than a keyboard, with its misleading white-black distinctions.  Otherwise, piano is obviously a lot easier technically; and bigger range and better for theory.  (And the white-black distinction is at least historically informative, as well as perfectly suited to staff notation.)


Excellent summary otherwise. :-)"

I think they're both good, but tend to go to Fairview El Sitio as it's a little closer to where I live now."
