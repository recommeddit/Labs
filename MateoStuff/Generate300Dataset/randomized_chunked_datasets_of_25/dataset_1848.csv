49571,"I'd like to point out a few things.

Getting a 144hz panel definitely makes sense even if you can barely do 60FPS in games, because the high refresh rate makes tearing less noticeable. I am now without a GPU so I'm trying out games on my iGPU, which rarely pushes above 60FPS in anything from the previous decade. And I have to note that I'm not noticing any tearing in these games. If you want to lock your framerate, with a 60hz panel you can only chose 20, 30 and 60FPS. With a 144 hz panel, you can lock at 24, 36, 48 and 72 FPS without changing the refresh rate of the panel.

It's worth saying that some 144hz monitors will have higher pixel response times when they're running at lower refresh rates. So if that applies to your model and you're running a game at something like 60FPS, you really want to run that game without adaptive sync unless it's causing issues.

When buying a monitor for gaming, always check the reviews (actual reviews that test the monitor, not just user reviews that talk about the experience and parameters). Overdrive in particular should be of interest to gamers. LCD pixels have to physically move in order to change their brightness (that's why they have response times). Overdrive does what the word implies, it pushes more current into the pixels, forcing them to move faster. The problem is that you can actually have too much overdrive - this is called overshooting and what happens is that the pixel moves further than it should and it then has to move back. The result is reverse ghosting, which (at least for me personally) is far worse than ghosting. That's why the highest overdrive setting isn't always the best (in fact, it almost never is).

Although expensive monitors can have the exact same panel as a cheaper one, the truth is that two panels of the same model don't necessarily have to be identical. This is especially true with very cheap monitors.  LCD panels aren't made individually, they're cut from a larger panel. Each panel is then inspected and rated for it's quality. Depending on the quality, the panel will either go into the more expensive or the cheaper model. So it's not that the manufacturer is purposefully limiting the cheaper monitor, they're using a panel that wouldn't pass the quality control of the expensive model. That's why professional monitors are so expensive - the panels that go inside them are cherry picked.",best gaming monitor
