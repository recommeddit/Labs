54242,best medicine for a cold,"I came to post the 7 days to a week comment, but I'll piggy back and expand on yours.  Jewish penicillin  is the way to go.  I make a big batch using a whole chicken, veg, noodles and 4 to 5 times as much garlic and black pepper as you would think to use. 

This will keep you hydrated, fed, and open up the sinuses like draino. Pretty tasty too."
70570,best major to study in college,"There are zillions of online resources for this that will give you good exposure to various technologies, from 101 and advanced. Spend some time w some basic tutorials, get a feel for what might interest you, then dig deeper. 

In the end, you're going to have to work hard, there are no shortcuts, only better routes. No one is a natural and just nails math, or anything else, they work at it. Get some late night focus sessions going, make it important to you, find your growth mindset. It's all up to you, no one else is going to make it happen. Want your 6 figures? Go get 'em."

works for me.

It plays in background and i can set playback speed. That is all what i want.

Tip: if you are listening to a audiobook with more than one chaper and have multiple files, make a playlist. It is one time process and free you from navigating file manager each time you want to listen tothe book."
22027,best celebrity,"Kelly Clarkson. The southern charm thing isn't an act. Coincidentally I also met the meanest celebrity the same night, Avril Lavigne. 

Shout out to Blink-182 as well, in my short time working with celebrities, they were the only ones I was actually a huge fan of and they were super cool as well, Mark Hoppus especially.

EDIT: Also now that I think about it, Gym Class Heroes were super cool as well.  Their singer was an especially nice guy."
