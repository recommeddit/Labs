31962,best hotel to live in,"What's the name of the eco lodge if you don't mind me asking?  It's funny how it seems opposite with Hilton now.  Their mid level hotels are terribly priced, like 60k points for a 200 dollar room, yet 95k points for a $1000 dollar room in Koh Samui or Conrad Tokyo.  

When you compare to Hyatt which earns about 1x on its credit card and caps at 30k and Hilton which earns at 3x but caps at 95k, Hilton is still good for the expensive hotels, but is terrible for redeeming at mid levels."

5764,best programming language for web development,"It depends how big of a team they have. At the place I'm working at it's just me and one other person working on the website. So I have to learn both. But with bigger teams, from what i understand, they'll have people specialize in one or the other. As a front-end web developer it's useful to know some back-end stuff so that you get a good understanding of the bigger picture and you're able to communicate with the back-end people, but you really only need to know the basics."

42299,movies like Inception,"i read the book first and loved it but holy shit, the film was brilliant. I dont really like Ben Affleck in much but he was made for the part. So frustrating and nerve racking to watch."
68842,best science fiction novel,It looks to be a very under the radar pick compared to the rest of the list (all the rest of which I have heard and/or are showing up on other top lists). I looked it up and it appears to be $3 on the US kindle store right now.

48326,best color to paint with,"If you have Ikea off-white cabinets or furniture, the matching color is Valspar Dove White, 7002-7.

Personally I like colors on my walls and ceiling, but since I'm slowly installing an Ikea Groemslov kitchen, I've been painting all my trim to match the eventual cabinets."
15257,best tree for the garden,"Fun fact: The biggest magnolia tree in the world is in Old Washington State Park in Arkansas. After part of the tree was damaged and died (in a storm of some kind, iirc), it was *still* considered the largest magnolia tree, because it's that fucking big."
63731,best books for time management reddit,"I read Stephen Covey's book years ago and yes, would recommend it.  

The Power of an Hour by Dave Lakhani.

There's a website called Simpleology that can help with managing your time and priorities.

Getting a handle on your schedule and priorities will probably go a long way to helping your stress and anxiety. 

Figure out your ""why"" and write it down.  Keep it close at hand and refer to it whenever you feel yourself slipping.  Then take immediate action. 

Oh, and Napolean Hill's ""Outwitting the Devil.""  I listened to this one on CD in my car and found it very entertaining and helpful!

Best of luck and hang in there!"

54372,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"The Hien is noticeably faster. The Aqua Control Plus is one of the most, if not the most, balanced mousepad available in terms of speed and control."
22736,best celebrity,"A few years back, my grandmother (then about 75 years old) and Adam Sandler's father had back-to-back chemo appointments in Boston. Every week she would see Adam Sandler, in sunglasses, come with his father to chemo. Her cancer was stage III at this point and she was under a great deal of stress, and honest to God, Adam Sandler used to rub her back and ease her nerves before going in. Unfortunately his Dad died that year, but my grandmother made a full recovery. Never really liked Adam Sandler's stuff that much, but the way he treated my sick, elderly grandmother was incredible.

I hope this doesn't get buried, I tell this story all the time and nobody believes me. But it really, really happened. What a great guy."

16321,best sunglasses for fashion,"It's hard to recommend sunnies without knowing what your face looks like as different sunnies look good for different people. 

But if the wayfarer looked good on you, you could always try the clubmaster which became pretty popular a while ago.  

Aviators suit most faces imo and can make you look 4x more masculine. 

Or change it completely and try a [round style](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1X1NhHVXXXXcyXVXXq6xXFXXXk/sun-glasses-sunglasses-men-vintage-round-circle-lens-frame-mens-goggles-brand-designer-aviator-sun-oculos.jpg)

Also it's not just the style itself. Mix up the colour of the frames and lenses. I like the tortoise shell frames personally but I've seen a lot of guys pull off wooden frames as well."
