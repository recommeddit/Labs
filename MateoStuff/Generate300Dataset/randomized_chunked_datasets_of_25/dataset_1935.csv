34942,best NFL player,"> I also know Watson had a much worse team

Being a piece of shit aside, Watson had like a 70% completion rating, and a top three yards per attempt. Meaning he was completing a ton of his passes WHILE airing it out amongst the most in the league. 

Randall Cobb, Keke Coutee, and Jordan Akins each had 400 yards. What Watson did last season was absolutely insane and honestly one of the best QB performances like, maybe ever. He could not have done more with less.

AND he threw it away."

46803,best hand santizer brand,"Dear stupid article:

The proper way to test a claim is not to say ""If the products were fully tested on hands, there would no doubt be different results. Since there is inherent complexity in the human hand, testing hands would definitely be more difficult."" Instead, the proper way to test a claim is to actually test it. I'm not even a scientist and I can easily see that you could do hand cultures of various cleansing mechanisms and actually test the claims of sanitizer manufacturers. 

Who knows, it might actually support your claim. Why don't you try it?"

15945,best sunglasses for fashion,"I swear by Maui Jims. Not made by Luxotica like most fashion brands and Ray Ban. I've had ray bans too but nothing compares to the quality, polarization, and most of all- the color you get with Mauis. They actually make everything look better. They just seem to boost color in a beautiful and non-obnoxious way. Think of importing a photo into an editing program and using the ""enhance"" feature. That's what the lenses do. 

my favorites are the Dawn Patrol with the bronze lenses."

73365,best battery bank,"If you want 20,000 mAh you need to expect to carry something about 0.4kg. The lightest is probably the Anker PowerCore 20100 at 355g; the rest are 380-450g.

At this capacity all the power banks are ‘baggable’ rather than pocketable and the come in about twice the thickness of your phone; they also take overnight to charge from empty and you must use a high power charger; if you save weight by packing a puny 1A charger it’s going to take a full day.

However 20,000 mAh is comfortably enough to run my phone for five or six days. If you’re going to be away from power for more than a week like this, you have other things to consider so I think 20000mAh is the maximum sensible capacity for everything except crazy expeditions.

I can thoroughly recommend the Anker ones, they are lightest at this capacity and very well built. There are several models with different combinations of ports and power delivery options. They don’t support passthrough charging (Anker say it’s risky), but otherwise have every feature set.

Personally I wouldn’t cheap out on this kind of device and invest in a reputable brand. There is enough energy being transferred around when charging and discharging these big batteries that you don’t want an overheating and fire risk in your bag.

If you want something more pocketable, step down to 10,000 mAh chargers; at this point you’re talking about something phone sized."
