"I want my dad to focus on his damn health. I want the crazy go anywhere guy. Unless I smoked a ton and wanted to watch Law and Order repeatedly,we wouldn't hang out. It is horrible. I want my dad back. Not for me and my selfish ideations. For my mom. She's hurting without him. Sure he there physically but her husband isn't. Her lover is gone. I want them to be the couple that I was to model my marriage after. I want my dad to want another year of life. It's too much to ask but damnit, I want my father, my daddy back. F.M.L."
I hate but just because you're right.
I need more tumbleweed content

"I have the Men's version of the LunarEpic Low's and the Pegs...I use the LunarEpics for my short distance runs / casual day to day \- and I use the Pegs for all my longer runs and all my races...love them both...i'd just make sure you're comfortable with how ""spongy"" the LE's feel over a longer period of time...they feel like clouds on your feet when you're just walking around and for shorter runs...but I can't speak for how they feel over longer distances \(over 10K//6.2M\)...also, my one gripe with them is that their sole collects little pebbles and debris like crazy...it's mildly annoying when you're running and you can hear/feel the scraping of them!

Was just at the Nike Outlet the other day and they had the LunarEpic's for 100 CAD. I think they had the Pegs 33's on for around the same, as well."
"...I've always wanted to know about the beans  for brekkie thing. Are they sweet, or savory?"
I adore Gary Gulman and didn’t know he had a special on Netflix. This is wonderful news.
"Thank you for all the different suggestions and descriptions, I appreciate it! I’ll check these out. :)"
"Switch is cheap, portable and has great exclusives. For your 500 you could get the system, one aaa game, a pro controller, and a year of nintendo online which comes with a wealth of emulated nes and snes games. And youd still have money left over."
"So I've thought about the colognes I've used, and I think Acqua di Gio is currently my top choice. It's apparently overused, but I like it."
"I love catnip tea, although sometimes I wish it had the same effect on humans that it does cats. But the relaxing effect on humans is pretty grand!"
"Oh yes. I loved this twist and how it was brought. 

My boyfriend, as usual, was ""But... That was clear since the beginning, no??""

And it took 15 minutes to explain it to my parents who had completely missed the point."

Remember when Trent Williams had literal fucking cancer and the Washington team medical staff was like “looks good to us.” Lol

[The Headphone List](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone-review-list/) agrees with you assuming a ~$100 budget. For under $70 looks like a Koss Pro DJ100 or Superlux HD668B.
Have you six ages prequel? Kings of Dragon Pass?
"Can confirm.. I make $120k a year and I live in a 500sq ft 5 story walkup, and have very little disposable income after rent and living expenses."
"So, a vacuum? No one else is going to use it anyway..."
"I wish I had stayed on the music path and not worried about making money. I would have loved to study music, I still sometimes wish I did. But, for now, History is fine. Maybe I'll go to a different university and study music there after this degree. Then I could play more quidditch, too!"
It makes Passover easier ;}
