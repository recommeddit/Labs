Really fascinating stuff. It's just that *it takes so friggin long for anything to happen*. The books feel like they're great concepts that have been stretched to the breaking point and then stuffed with filler material."

She just always seems so uptight & full of herself, I can't stand the way she talks to other people & I really can't stand that she talked so much shit to Kylie only to turn around and get the same shit done.

*side note- I always thought it was hilarious as Cait was transitioning, she told Kris this whole thing would make her (Cait) a ""better person"" LOL yeah, okay!"
