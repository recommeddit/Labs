"This is the exact explanation I got. I was under the impression that Japan wanted to do some empire building in their neck of the woods, but were afraid that if they were to get bogged down in fighting in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya the Americans would come across the Pacific and either attack Japan itself or make supplying the forward deployed forces impossible. They planned to destroy our Pacific presence in one fell swoop, make their land grabs in Asia, and be back to defend their flank before we could re-mobilize."
"Ah, I hope you get to try it soon! It opens with a rather unremarkable blend of bamboo and pink peppercorn but after ~15-20 minutes you get to the heart with champaca, basmati rice, and green tea, and it becomes so beautiful and tender; and then there's some myrhh, etc., in the base to add warmth to the concoction."
Cool idea
"By definition teams under CAF will get fewer points than teams under UEFA for the same performance, as CAF teams have a lower coefficient."

They had a superior bench strength ..hell even the players not picked by aus could have started in other international teams.

"Good point, I have bought fasteners professionally in the past as part of my work. McMaster is great for finding rare or unique items and their product drawings are awesome. However you pay much higher unit prices."

Well it is a public institution it should try and serve the residents of that state who pay taxes to help the university first before those who are out of state.
"> In what world do you lead the league in picks (10) and you aren't even in the top 50 PFF players?

In a world where this list is the 50 best players in the NFL for **2021**. From the introduction:

> [""The ranking below is a projection of what we think will happen and not necessarily a reaction to a spectacular or underwhelming 2020 season.""](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-pff50-ranking-50-best-players-nfl-2021)

PFF already released a list of the top players for the 2020 season only and Howard was 26th. But for this list, they're considering past performance as well as projecting for this year, so leaving Howard (who isn't young and doesn't have a spotless record of performance with 2 good years and 3 meh ones) off seems fine to me."
"There are quite a number of countries which are considered ""better"" to life in than in the US. Have you ever seen the first episode of season 1 of The Newsroom? Jeff Daniels makes a pretty good argument right there.
In Europe there are a few countries which can be considered ""better"", but it depends on your point if view and if you have money. If you are rich, the US isn't so bad, until you run into law enforcement and you are African American. 
New Zealand, Canada or Australia aren't so bad, although every other animal tries to kill you down under."
