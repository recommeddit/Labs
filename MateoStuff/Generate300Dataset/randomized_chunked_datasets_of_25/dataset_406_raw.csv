"Uhh, well the calories aren't what's gonna hurt your workout bud that would be the ""toxins"" in alcoholic drinks that make you hungover. Aside from the ethanol in alcoholic drinks that gets you drunk, there are other substances called congeners. These are byproducts of fermentation that give alcoholic drinks their flavor, and scientists think they also contribute to the feeling of being hungover (in addition to other factors like dehydration and loss of vitamins). Alcohols that contain less congeners are going to contribute less to a hangover, and are generally clear and of ""higher quality"". So, top shelf vodka for example, would be a good choice."

"Use Laravel, I made the same kind of site in about 4 weeks."
"> PHP is ok for blogs and shit, not for any real development.

Your fedora will fit better if your head's not up your ass. Seriously. PHP is very viable for a lot of things. And PHP pages aren't any less ""real""."
Holy mint pandas
"I tend to avoid the low budget hotels.  My typicak go-tos are Hyatt Place (esp if they have 5000 point award rate), HIEX or Fairfields.

If going internationally, I like ibis hotels."

"oh hell yeah!! Copenhagen and Amsterdam are the most welcoming and wonderful cities in the world, and the people there are incredible. I hope to study, work and/or live in either country some day.

Coop Home Goods pillows are seriously amazing. Life changing. I sleep so much better. It doesn’t go flat like down. I throw it in the dryer with wool dryer balls every 6 months to freshen it up.
