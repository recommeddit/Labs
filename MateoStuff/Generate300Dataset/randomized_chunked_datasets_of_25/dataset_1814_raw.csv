"I have 2 bottles of the old reformulation, I only use it in very special occasions"
Just a day off
"I just love mole plates. An acquired taste I guess you could say. Also, monys and lillys are the most traditional places I have found imo. Open to suggestions tho!!"

"Looks 100% arcade, just like FH4. PC1 was a simcade, PC2 improved a bit and was almost a sim."
"1. Royal Oud (heavenly, timeless, classy)

2. Aventus (120ml bottle days, not anymore)

3. Noir de Noir (this is what a deep & intense perfume should smell like)

4. Soleil Blanc (this is what light & easy to wear perfume should smell like)

5. Neroli Portofino Forte (sparkling, zesty, refreshing but obscenely priced)

6. Aventus for Her (Better than Aventus but so feminine thankfully, I am not tempted to wear it)

7. Royalle Muske (because Old Spice doesn’t smell the same as 20 years ago)

8. Davidoff Cool Water (most bang for buck scent)

9. LNDL or TdH(Both are a must-have for everyone starting a collection)

10. Kiehl’s Original Musk (most bang for buck musk)"
Today I learned: Christensen is younger than Ake
Talking biotech by Kevin Folta
I bet she'll love that.
On my last romance novel kick I enjoyed Hazard by Jo Beverley (Regency setting).
"I played through 90 or so scenarios with my wife. It was a hoot! Dungeon delving, new scenarios, skin of your teeth wins and losses, what’s not to love?

I would never try to play it with 3 other non family members. I could never trust that kind of commitment."
"Yeah, he’s an idiot. I have a college degree from prior to the Army from a state school. I’m applying to green to gold to earn my masters and commission because I’m sick of Intel. 

The board of Officers that select Soldiers for this program put in their AAR last year, “brick and mortar schools held more weight than those who went to online schools.” So it isn’t just a check the box like some people say. You will be judged, ESPECIALLY in the civilian world."
"Ain't that the truth. But when I showed up was when SoftBank, and only SoftBank had the iPhone so everyone was going there. I didn't know any better and it was where my sponsor took me. 

When I went back stateside I kept forgetting I didn't need to go outside to use my phone- it was strange."
"So, make chicken soup? I actually did that the other day. I made more than I usually do and it's a good thing. Boyfriend got sick, too! I had some for breakfast. :)"
"Came here to comment specifically on Sahara and Fools Gold - definitely true that we don't seem to see many films like that these days. 

Where did the fun movies go?

Sahara

Without a Paddle was a good one

"Maybe, but in 4+ years in California with Fi, I have never been connected to a US Cellular site.  Fi will not connect to Verizon towers as far as I know."
"Goats are browsers, not grazers.  They don't eat grass unless there's nothing else; they much prefer leaves, flowers, bark and such.  What you want is a sheep."
"I agree with /u/HarbisonCarnegie. I just graduated with a degree in finance from a highly ranked school and still, more accounting courses would have been the ideal supplement. In hindsight, there are a few problems with studying finance. 

Finance is largely a soft skill in the sense that it gives you an understanding of market participants, investment strategies and financial concepts. This is fine and all but when you graduate, you'll want hard, marketable skills, ie accounting.

Second, finance is a somewhat saturated field. It's more glamorous than accounting and attracts more students. Unfortunately, there is much stronger demand for accountants than financial analysts. In my opinion, by adding an accounting concentration/minor, you'll be setting yourself up for success.

I'm not too familiar with supply chain management although I've heard that it's a growing, in demand field. Law is a SUPER saturated field."
