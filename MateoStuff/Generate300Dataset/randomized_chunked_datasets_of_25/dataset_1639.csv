67065,"http://skydivesac.com/

these folks have tons of experience, and the view is spectacular. there are good deals on groupon, too, which makes them a bargain in comparison to some of the other locations around the bay area.

skydive sacramento has a good deal for a tandem skydive from 13,000 feet. the highest allowable dive is 18,000 feet, after which you would need a self-contained breathing apparatus. skydiving out of Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay provide for the best scenery due to the oceanic views, but they are the most expensive and they tend to be from lower drop zones from 8,000 feet.

as a good measuring stick, at least on groupon, it is about $100-$150 from 8,000 feet.

I hope this helps!
