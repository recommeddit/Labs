67065,best places to skydive in california,"http://skydivesac.com/

these folks have tons of experience, and the view is spectacular. there are good deals on groupon, too, which makes them a bargain in comparison to some of the other locations around the bay area.

skydive sacramento has a good deal for a tandem skydive from 13,000 feet. the highest allowable dive is 18,000 feet, after which you would need a self-contained breathing apparatus. skydiving out of Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay provide for the best scenery due to the oceanic views, but they are the most expensive and they tend to be from lower drop zones from 8,000 feet.

as a good measuring stick, at least on groupon, it is about $100-$150 from 8,000 feet.

I hope this helps!

16727,best pet for toddlers,"Hamsters are pretty gross IMO. Lots of poo to clean and not very interactive. I hear bunnies can be trained to use a litterbox and rats (if you can get past the thought of it) are quite smart, trainable and affectionate. Bearded dragons and ball pythons make great small pets too and don't smell as bad as hamsters. Whatever you choose please do your research on what each animal requires for care and what is a good fit for your own family"
