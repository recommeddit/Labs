"Paul Rudd.   I was at a Decemberists concert, and in between opening acts, I headed to the women's bathrooms.  Paul Rudd was standing outside of the bathroom, obviously waiting for someone.  Do you ever have one of those moments where your mouth just says words without the permission of your brain?  Yeah.  As I passed by Paul Rudd, I did finger guns at him and said, ""Hanging out in front of the women's bathroom?  That's a good way to pick up women."" and kept walking.  I could hear him laughing as I entered the bathroom.  I was torn between being pleased that I made him laugh and being mortified that I was such a dork.  When I left the bathroom, he saw me and started laughing again, so I went over to him and said I had no idea why I said that.  So we had a little laugh together, and had a nice little chat.  He was a really nice guy, not even as a celebrity, just as a cool dude.  

Although thinking back on it, no woman came out of the bathroom and came over to him while he was waiting, so I still don't know why  he was hanging around outside of the bathrooms.  Maybe he WAS picking up women.  &#3232;\_&#3232;"
Can you repost or pm the list please?
"Man temples of boom is easy in my favourite 5 albums of all time, any music.

Watch The Leftovers. It's so damn complex. Pacing is medium. It's a psychological show meaning it deals with human nature. It's the most gripping show I've watched ever. Never yawned while watching it.

"Also, this is a nitpick, but when using the app in-store in Lowes, where the app tells you an item is located, like aisle and bay, it's usually totally inaccurate and I spend an extra 5 minutes looking or flagging an employee.  Home Depot app is always spot on when using it in-store."
Usually just front but you can use it for back also with ky-universal.
I’ve tried on all three in store. I basically tried on the entire store lol and these three were my favorite. But haven’t had the chance to take any of them on a run
"my understanding of asbestos is that the problem with asbestos is that it is friable and damages the lungs when inhaled. 

I've not seen much regarding the consumption of asbestos. [here is a link to a WHO report that says there is no increased incidence of cancer through ingestion](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/asbestos.pdf)"
"Learn Ruby. It is a beautifully designed language that will help you form a concept of programming. A popular web framework using Ruby is Ruby on Rails. It is a joy to use, and easy for beginners because it is very strongly opinionated (e.g. dictates you on where to put stuff). You will pick up HTML and CSS along the way.

An alternative is learning JavaScript and use a full-stack JavaScript framework. I recommend Meteor. I think it will become very popular in the coming decade, just as Rails did. One thing I don't like is that JavaScript is not particularly a pretty language and it can be frustrating to use. I felt so when I was just starting out."
"Yeah, I haven’t seen it in years. I’ll have to save this video and go watch the movie again. I didn’t see it on Netflix, though; must not be on US."
It gets up to 70-90% off if you get it at the right time.
Same. But people can't seem to stay away from unnecessary dependencies and bloat for some reason.

"Yea that was my first approach, but as I already know exactly what I'm going to be getting as a response, I figured I'd wrap it in a promise so I could drill down into the response a bit. Again, to help my mental state ha.

example:

instead of calling it like so:

    getAccount(id,id).then((response) => {  
        response.data.RSP.WHATEVERISHERE 
     })

i can just do:

    getAccount(id,id).then((response) => {  
        WHATEVERISHERE 
     })

sometimes it's the small things...

also await would've been another great solution, but I went this route to make the code just a bit cleaner should my co-worker have to dig through it if I end up getting hit by a bus ;)

edit-- I know 'cleaner code' in this instance is per person, but still"
"Gen 2 had the monster design space of 1 but had a much more interesting world that never completely grinds to a halt of ""fight Elite 4, buy items, repeat"" like Gen 1. So logically the remake HG/SS builds on that even further and it's just great.

Diamond/Pearl and Black/White are fun too. Probably have the most hours in LeafGreen"
I wonder how an electric toothbrush like this compares to soft bristled nonelectric ones.

Ranger. I am curious to how midnight commander  contends with ranger. I like ranger since I am familiar with python enough that I can add my own custom commands very easily. I don't know how I could navigate efficiently using any gui. I spend most of my time clucking icons where in ranger I can click three keys to get to where I need to be. It is marvelous.
