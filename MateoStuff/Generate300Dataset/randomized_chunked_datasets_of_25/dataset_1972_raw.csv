"I am not sure if I’ve ever laughed so hard at a video in my life, WHEW. Full on belly laugh that turned into silent laughter with tears. The one comment under the video that said FETCH ME THEIR SOULS Hahahah I can’t even type it without crying. I’m dog sitting and the dog just jumped off the bed and went in the corner to sleep because I was disturbing him. But imagine if your dog vomited like this every time!!!

This is comparable to the little girl eating spaghetti and almost vomiting while smiling through it and trying to be polite and the mom has the same tone asking her if she likes it and if she’s ok, haha"

"When I graduated in 1993 from UNC Chapel Hill in Geography, the mean income for graduates was $500K per year.

"I have a stack of unplayed Spidey games in my collection going back to the 2002 PS2 game, which is still in the plastic, come to think of it. One day I will get around to playing all of them. But I have to catch up on about five different Final Fantasy entries and every Halo game after Halo 2.

I missed about a decade of (video) gaming and am slowly getting back into it. I was still gaming during this time, mind you, but focusing on chess, Magic and poker. That's more info than you needed but yeah. I'll get around to the PS4 game. Eventually."

"When I was homeless in Venice Beach, California. I met Tobey McGuire while I was asking for spare change, he was kind enough to give me some money, and I asked him if he was spiderman. His friends that were with him started walking off when I said that, but he smiled and told me to have a nice day. So, Tobey McGuire is nice to homeless, generous and he was very polite to his fans."
