64722,"So all these brands make good shoes.  Adidas and Nike also make a lot of cross trainers and fashion shoes that are not really designed for serious running.  Brooks, Hoka, Altra, Saucony, etc. basically only make running shoes, so a lot of specialty running stores tend to carry those.  But Adidas and Nike make plenty of great running shoes.  I currently have both Brooks and Nike shoes in the shoe rotation.

Sometimes before shopping for shoes, I'll browse websites that review shoes because I have a general sense of the type of feel that I like in a running shoe and it will narrow down shoes to try out.  Sometimes you can also demo shoes at running store group run meet ups too. One site I like a lot is this one: [http://www.roadtrailrun.com/](http://www.roadtrailrun.com/)",Best Nike running shoes

24013,"* [Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) - Sci Fi Thriller. This is my favorite series, It starts of slow, but after a certain moment everything goes into overdrive and it will be an emotional rollercoaster till the last episode. The plot and characters are both amazing, and it also has a surprisingly good romance.

* [Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) - Psychological thriller. I won't say much about this, because otherwise I would spoil it. This anime has an amazing story and is not at all what it seems. Watch at least 3/4 episodes before dropping this, it's worth it.

* [Mawaru Penguindrum](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) - Psychological mystery. Giving a synopsis of this anime is impossible, the  MAL description is the best you can get. It again has a very good story, told with a lot of symbolism and metaphors, which means you have to pay attention the entire time. It is about life, death, fate and changing fate.

* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) - supernatural drama/horror. This is about 5 children living in a utopia a 1000 years in the future, but not everything is as it seems. This series starts of quite slow, but that is because it begins with its amazing worldbuilding. The last 4/5 episodes are completely worth everything. 
There are a few infamous scenes around episode 8, which caused some people to drop the anime, don't do that. Those scenes are completely explained within the lore, and will lessen after a few episodes.

* [AnoHana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.) - supernatural drama. If you want an emotional anime, watch this one. It tells the story of a group of childhood friends who, after the death of one of them, slowly grow apart. Suddenly, one of them can see that friend again, who will only go away if her last wish is completed. The problem, she doesn't know what that wish was anymore. This is a beautiful story about loss and the different ways to cope with it. It's ending is almost guaranteed to make you cry.

* [Gurren Lagann](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) - action mech. Want something mindblowingly epic, something over the top awesome. Look no further. This anime is the definition of over the top. As one character in the show says, kick logic to the curb and do the impossible. Turn of your brain and enjoy this epic show, with the most manly character ever created.

If you want to know more about one of these shows, just ask me.",best anime

In the later novels he recycles and rehashes to many characters from previous arcs, and the need for bigger and badder villains can be a little tedious but then he can also pull some fantastic characters and plots out of the bag so I would recommend sticking with him and giving them all a read. They aren't particularly difficult to get through anyway.",best action and adventure novel series

The screen protector doesn't fit perfectly flush against the screen, it's really close but it's just not there, and as a result the touch screen can be finicky and feels like first gen touch screens. 

But the thing is, when I get my next phone I'll probably buy another Defender, my phone just feels a lot safer in one. I'm not scared to hand my phone to my 2 year old niece, I'm not worried about knocking my phone off my counter when cooking, I just feel safer with it than I do with any of the other cases I've used in the past.",best iphone case
