"I love my cast iron.  I read awhile back that the use of soap and water after use was fine (it was a 7 myths about cast iron debunked article...can't remember where, sorry).  I had always thought as you do but decided to throw caution to the wind and wash them.  
They're fine...still non stick and still cook fantastically."
"Steve1989MREInfo. Something about watching a guy eat various different kinds of MREâ€™s is satisfying to watch

Edit: thanks for the awards and the happy cake days and replies everyone, Iâ€™m far too drunk to respond but I appreciate it non the less"
That...explains a lot?

I would suggest watching it being slightly sleep deprived.  The first time I saw it was at 2 am and it completely freaked me out.
Agreed. I've been upgrading everything to USB C for about 2 years now. ðŸ˜‰

"1. Feminite Du Bois - Shiseido.Â  My hands down all time number one signature since I first purchased at Bloomingdales' Shiseido counter circa 1993.Â  Its different than the Lutens version.Â  Richer and more full.Â  The Lutens seems hollow and dry in comparison.Â  Though I've gone through many bottles of both over the years!

2.Â  Kelly Caleche EDT *not* EDP - Hermes.Â  I am in love with this cool leathery rose and it makes me feel like a classy bitch with a naughty side. 

3.Â  Coco - Chanel.Â  Just a powerhouse classic.Â  SO good.Â  I'd like to add Coromandel - Chanel here because I really adore both.

4.Â  Poison - Dior.Â  Of all my fragrances this is my boyfriends favorite on me.Â  Been wearing it since the 90s.Â  It's extra good if you are pale with black hair and kind of an ice queen.Â  That purple bottle.....

5. L de Lolita - Lolita Lempicka.Â  Such a yummy salty caramelish dessert.Â  Delicious.Â  Because its similar, I'll tack on Tendre Madeleine - Laurence Dumont.Â  They are both wonderful gourmand vanillaÂ clouds.

6.Â Tam Dao - Diptique.Â  So zen.Â  So relaxing.Â  So meditative.Â  I reach for this when I mentally need it.

7.Â  Lord of Misrule - Lush.Â  This one is such a big, wild cacophony of notes I enjoy plucking them individually out of the air around me.Â  And waking up with that lingering stale vanilla patchouli on your pillow and clothing is amazing.Â  I bought the BIG bottle.

8.Â  By the Fireside - Replica.Â  Sometimes it smells like a sexy ashtray.Â  Sometimes it smells like a sexy marshmallow.Â  Because I wish it could be a cool October all year round, well, yes, I DO want to smell like a firepit.

9.  Lost Cherry - Tom Ford.Â  The liquor.Â  The cherry tobacco.Â  The gluttony.Â 

10.  SolÂ De Janeiro Bum Bum Cream - I am addicted to the smell of this lately and cannot stop slathering it all over myself.Â  Yummy creamy pistachio caramel goodness!"
Haha same except kourtney and Kendall are switched
This is old news. Just a reminder - use uBlock Origin instead.
"Theres....A LOT of quests in the main storyline, which is something you have to go through to unlock aspects and mechanics of the game. When I say a lot..I mean hundreds, literally hundreds (300+ I think?). It's a slow burn for like the first 1/3 or so until the story gets good at the first expansion. If you can march through that first section, it's worth it.

I've heard they are working on streamlining the experience but not sure when it's supposed to be implemented."
I upvoted to every mention of Dream Quest
Well when you don't actually have to leave at any point it that would seem to make it both more likely you would leave only when you had to... and encourage attempts to make that happen because people can't just wait it out.
absolutely!! xo

Could you theoretically seal your own suitcases with shrink wrap and tape rather than pay for it at the airport?

"I can't find *anything* in HD's electrical department without staring for 20 minutes, and I *used to work* there.

But I sent someone who knows absolutely nothing about anything and who can barely use a computer an email with a link to a shallow-work electrical box on HD's website and they were able to find it immediately.

The system works."

"Should be Madrid, Milan, Liverpool \(as we all know if the English teams weren't banned they'd have most likely a few more CLs\) Bayern, Barca."
"And conversly, dead meat has made me a way bigger horror fan than when I first started and has turned me on to some great movies! Watching Sinister was the highlight of my week and I would've had no desire to if notnfor the killcount!"
I usually just throw on a EDM set from soundcloud.  No changing songs and continously playing.
