I believe blood has emerged on his genitals due to *fucking a dead body*.
Will have to check it out now. Thanks!
"Unfortunately these (wayfarer version) were amazing but I have not been able to find them in any Costco for several years across several states and many different stores.  Bummer, as I had a pair and would love to see them again.  Only seen the aviator ones the last few years. I try and leave a comment card at most stores to bring back the wayfarers, but seems unlikely at this point several years later."
"In my AP U.S. History class, I remember it being taught in the context of Manifest Destiny and how it contributed to the civil war later by messing up the balance of free and slave states. We talked about many of the generals, battles, and other events like the Bear Flag revolt too."
Please call the electric Volkswagen a VoltsWagen thanks.
"Nice, I'm literally 200 yards from the Blue line to the north."
I guess he deserved [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mat4tiz3B21rwxz9ko1_500.gif) then.
"Yeah, I think you're right, I was just saying that if you're trying to determine what tier a school is, emphasis on teaching is a good indicator."
"Yeah I feel that. I really feel that they should be more affordable. But they're a collaborative effort so you're paying more people, and they tend to print a lower number when compared to novels. I've never minded paying the money - but that's probably conditioning.

I don't get the e reader argument, but thats just because I'm old fashioned and haven't yet been converted to the modern tech. ðŸ˜Š"
"I did go through the whole program. I loved it. I mean it helped me leverage my prior experiences (fine art sales and exhibit production) so that Iâ€™m making much more money in a much more interesting environment. My program was 6k and worth every penny. 

Definitely do your research on the industry and be confident the program is something youâ€™re willing to commit to. Itâ€™s not enough to simply complete the program and expect a job to land on your lap. You definitely need to network and self educate and be genuinely interested in the work. The program is largely what you make it. Youâ€™ll get out of it what youâ€™re willing to put in. Not to mention the hiring process for these jobs can be very demanding and thereâ€™s nine million other people just as driven and ambitious as you are with just as good portfolios competing for the same roles, so you need to find your edge and really lean into that. For me, itâ€™s that Iâ€™m a great communicator and speaker, and add value to the teams Iâ€™m on because I am a great liaison between the stakeholders and the design team."
Nice! I loved The Night Of as well :)
"A Victorinox Swiss Army Knife. You can buy one for around $30-$50 and it is a gift that can be used for years to come. Also, some of the Alox models you can have engraved so he can keep it for years."
"I've had an LG 27GL83A-B since January and it's a great monitor. Unfortunately, in moving into an apartment, it got dropped and the panel is cracked. Where can I get a replacement panel for it?"
"Like, whiskey!"
"Yes! Last year when I said I wanted time alone or to not have to do anything I heard, ""So for Mother's Day you don't want to be a mom?"""
Not even close.
Damn this one looks good
"Man, I feel old. AD is AP to me."
"Disqualified you because you earned it online, right?"
"I have 3 pairs and theyâ€™re fine for those times times when thereâ€™s a high likelihood for drops, etc. But they feel cheap."
"When I refer friends to internal recruiters, the recruiters ask for a link to LinkedIn or a resume + phone number. Theyâ€™ve never asked for any other social media.

I have been recruited directly off of Twitter, GitHub, and StackOverflow profiles by smaller companies."
"I started by your podcast on domestication, a topic I know well, and it was a really cool introduction to the importance of tameness in domestication.

But I wanted to say, the concept of ""wolf pack"" is irrelevant. Wolves don't gather together, they live in family units, two adults with several litters until the subadults leave."
"I've been gaming on proper monitors since I picked up the hobby again.  Not the best of the best but the best of the thrifty pieces.    


The jump from 60-144 was night and day,  Felt so much better.  Even scrolling as you mentioned,  It was a nice upgrade... Felt ""professional""  lol  I finally parked my 6700k and upgraded to something newer (3700x)  recently, and it pairs nice with my 2070.  So I said fuck it,  Upgraded the monitor to a 2560x1440/144hz  AOC. Not to expensive but better than wishdotcom products lol.      


Once again, I am grateful I made this choice, the upgrade was noticeable and I am enjoying old games a little more now that  I have it all dialed in.     


Good post btw.. +1 from me, good advice.. Hopefully someone who needs to see this does!"
"I first read it when I was in my early teens. I did not understand the sci-fi angle. Then I read it a decade or so later, and I couldn't believe how blind I'd been the first time around. I must have read it half a dozen times since."
"I want to set a goal of being more social, especially with women I find attractive. Any ideas on an implementation for that?"
