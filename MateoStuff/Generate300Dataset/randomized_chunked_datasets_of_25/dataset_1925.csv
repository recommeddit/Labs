52101,best iphone case,"I have the tough armor on my 6+ after loving the one on my 5S. I always have put a skin on the back as well just because of the aforementioned logo cutout. 

Its a great case, I dropped my 5s a million times in the year I had it and it looked brand new when I sold it"

39839,best Chrome extensions,At least they are not ruining taking the socks with sandals industry :)
59949,best perfume,"Or the green version via Aspen.

51072,best rap album,"Apologies, mistake.  Number 3 is Hunky Dory by Bowie."
73160,best Linux distro,"More seriously - the value of the welcome screen can't be stated enough.  It's unlike any welcome screen I've ever seen elsewhere.

On your first post-install boot (you can also run it manually) you will be greeted with what is almost more of a control center than welcome screen.

It will give you point-and-click capability for many common tasks, some of which would normally require some CLI fiddling, including some very significant one-click look and feel changes.  It's super helpful for new users, and super convenient for more experienced users."
16627,best pet for toddlers,"Yeah, she's microchipped."

4978,best home improvement store,"Same! We have several home improvement projects going on and go to Lowe's right up the street often, but with more time on hand we've been making the 20 min. trip to HD because it's so much better. At Lowe's last week I heard a customer ask an employee, ""Excuse me, do you know where the [insert items] are?"" The guy just said, ""No, I don't"" without slowing down or offering to look it up. Surprised there was even an employee to be seen other than the check-out folks...anyway."
51662,best iphone case,Spigen Liquid Crystal just like I did for iPhone X.
68572,best science fiction novel,"I've attempted to read every one of them. Forever War was the one I read the most pages of. It was interesting at first then got boring.

Basically any book pre-1990 I don't like the style of."
38142,best Marvel movie,"Carol's my fav comic book character and has been for like the past 5 years. Even since Ultron, I've never felt the movies have foregrounded these characters' personal lives and the tragedy of those being lost because of how responsibility they take on -- partly because Whedon stopped having a hand in things, partly because they suddenly realised they had like 3 years until IW and hadn't done enough of the groundwork in setting that up sufficiently -- and this goes a step further. It's about someone who has their sense of being, their autonomy taken away and reclaims that through the course of the movie. Carol gets to choose who she wants to be.

And Boden & Fleck afford Brie so much space to give a human performance, the fact this movie has the time for the sequence in Louisiana is wonderful, the quietness of it all that gets all shaken up by the black box recording revealing the truth and her ""I don't even know who I am"" feels so big as a result."
70247,best major to study in college,"I'm gonna have to disagree with this. 

I'm a CS Senior with no GitHub, no good projects, and no extracurriculars. More importantly, absolutely no leetcode.

I am currently working an internship that pays me *really* well with an additional two internships after this one, with one being pretty prestigious. I was even extended an offer from my current internship, today actually, that would make me more money than I ever dreamed of making. I declined because I know a CS degree is so valuable that I can get more, regardless of how great that offer felt. 

Here's the ""secret"" to how I did it: Communication and mass applying. You don't need all those things that you listed."
73607,best battery bank,It's still away over budget and isn't sold in the UK.
3907,best online college,"Meanwhile, imagine having a family, a mortgage, and a job while attempting to go back to school. I'm not sure you can consider that easy in comparison to going to university. I worked full-time while taking 4-5 classes per semester when I was getting my BA and I still don't envy people who have to sacrifice any semblance of freetime in order to go back to school as an adult. People in both situations face their own unique set of difficulties and it's impossible to make any kind of blanket statement about who has it worse."
44623,best items under $100,"Full-spectrum lightbulbs, or at least very bright ones. My motivation and energy levels hit rock bottom in winter and faking some extra daylight makes a HUGE difference to my ability to function."
72025,best movies with a cool twist,"Thats right, when I realised it was actually the youngest fratelli brother trying to set him up my mind came out of my anus"
15531,best tree for the garden,"Thanks for the weed tip but I can't go with that :)

Yes, I meant real trees and I didn't mean like hitting the jackpot after 5 years but at least get something.

I assume you mean pine nuts. Great idea!"
37657,best Marvel movie,"I don’t see what’s so wrong with people saying this.

That “overrated” meme got legitimized the moment it was nominated for Best Picture.

Even judging it as a film by itself and not as an MCU fan, it’s pretty standard MCU-fare."
30291,best Mexican war to study,"They teach us that the some politicians wanted to fight mexico to conquer some land, it was very controversial so the peeps that wanted to go to war decided to send troops into contested territory in texas and used the Mexicans shooting at US troops as an excuse for war since the US claiming the Territory meant mexico firing at US troops in the contested Territory was technically an invasion

They won pretty easily and some even wanted to conquer all of Mexico but that didn't happen because it was a pretty stupid idea

That's what I was taught"
