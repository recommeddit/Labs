"Virginia has #3 and #6 #25 and #72 ranked schools, and it has population that is 5 times smaller than California. So it has more top schools *per capita*.

Realistically, this means that these to schools are a lot more accessible to average Virginian than to average Californian."
"Either you're contradicting yourself or you're supporting u/darknetj's claim.  If you don't mind, would you describe what information Ungoogled Chromium leaks to Google under what circumstance?"
"Not exactly. Cherry speed silvers are wayy too reactive. I always press W without knowing it, just resting my hand on the key."
"Oh I definitely agree on the replay value. I've never got into cosplaying the bosses but I love to come up with themed characters and limit them to only abilities and gear that would make sense for them.

Which in essence, is playing a role... I just can't list them as RPG's personally. I totally understand why people do though!"
"Engineering, I love linguistics, don’t get me wrong, but I miss doing math and Engineering just seems like it would have been so cool."
I thought season 1 was good. Season 2 is fantastic! Love the music. Klaus is my favorite!

"It's an accident. We buy our toast outright down here, but somewhere in the shipping process they are accidentally made into that shape. Something to do with the fact we're upside down and the magnetic poles being different than in China where they're manufactured... I don't even know, the science is ridiculously advanced. It's even been known to effect some humans who come into contact with the machines, and make their bodies into the same shape. Usually this kills them. A couple have survived, but are in intensive care facilities and won't survive long.
  
The equipment requires a certain calibration, but the Chinese are really reluctant to give it to us like that, and make the things so that we can't tamper with them to correct this issue. It's made people completely go off buying toast, and they actually resort to buying bread and toasters again (fucking disgusting, I know).  
  
There is some conspiracy about the toaster companies making a deal with the Chinese government to induce this dilemma, so that people would continue purchasing their toasters. I personally think it's bullshit, only because the amount of money they'd spend paying off the government would exceed toaster profits.  
  
Some people claim that toasters are being fitted with elaborate devices that spy on the owners, specifically for selling the information to advertising companies. This is just taking it a little bit too far in my opinion. The idea that they'd choose toasters is ridiculous when so many people use Weet-Bix instead of toast anyway.  
  
The only credible counter argument to this is that their technology actually hijacks your wifi, and the toaster is the only common household appliance (if the Australia-shaped toast continues to repulse people) that has the necessary hidden space to hide this device. It's also an appliance that you replace more readily than something like fridges, and the point before about low profits could be rendered void if the companies start releasing innovating (and expensive) toasters, that get many consumers to switch to them.  
  
It's a pretty dark time in Australia. To any Aussies reading this, please let your local MP know about this serious issue and help us fight the toaster companies who will **take away our freedom!**"

"That is one hell of a package. That's like £30. When/if I ever come to buying a new pair, I will definitely have another look at these."
"Yeah, its odd that people have an issue with this one. The presence of a buddimg romance doesnt negate the adventure. I mean, its about a treasure hunt. It has all the hallmarks of an adventure. I suppose the title is the problem?"

"Having just come back from Sandals in Montego Bay, Jamaica. .. I enjoyed it. If only for a mindless trip to the beach without having to worry about where to eat etc. My wife won the trip before we got married at one of those bridal shows where vendors/venues/services come advertise.

Further... it is disconcerting to see the slums of Jamaica after I just stuffed my face with sushi and crab legs while wasted off of free drinks."
"Depends. I think it's best to be able to use both coreutils and a file manager efficiently. I mostly use coreutils but when e.g. learning the codebase of a piece of software that has lots of files, a file manager can be very helpful."
"Looking for a recommendation for a replacement for my water damaged laptop. I had an HP Pavilion that was great until my house flooded and now it’s shot. It was a five year old laptop so probably time to upgrade anyways. 

I’m just a casual user, mainly will be using it for research and work, with occasional streaming. The most demanding activity I’ll be doing with it is working on large, formula laden spreadsheets. Generally, I would say I prioritize durability over light weight/compactness but I also don’t want a brick of a laptop.

I would like to stay under $800 but I can stretch it up to $1200 if it’s REALLY worth the jump for my uses. I saw a Samsung Flex A at Best Buy that looked good and I loved the QLED screen but saw generally mixed reviews on it. I’m not the most tech savvy so I would love to hear some recommendations!"
"Interesting. Then I would say that it still doesn't make any sense to vote before playoffs, if you want to predict who the best players will be going into the next season"

"Well hurry up and get on the hold list!  Also, someone might be able to loan it to you.  There’s a website about it but I can’t remember what it is.  /u/midlifecrackers do you remember what that website is?"
"Telemetry is super easy to disable in the official Microsoft package, and first thing I do when I install it.

* File -> Preferences -> Settings
* Type `telemetry` into search box
* Uncheck `Enable Telemetry` and `Enable Crash Reporter`
* Restart"

It also has an IPS screen for wider viewing angles. 


This 8th gen six-core CPU should be great for video editing and multitasking.

The 1050 Ti GPU can handle most current games on high settings.
