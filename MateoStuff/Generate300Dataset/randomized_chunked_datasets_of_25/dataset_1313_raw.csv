"So, if you're serious about choosing a scent for yourself, here's what you need to do:  
Start talking to a fragrance employee at a reputable store like a Nordstrom or Macy's. Tell them what you just said. They'll ask you some more questions and then pull out some stuff for you to sample based on that. If they are good employees they will be patient and let you smell a lot of them. Give them feedback when you smell one you really like and don't like.  
When I decided to get serious about choosing a fragrance I told the lady behind the counter that I really just don't want something 'sporty' at all. (I think sporty scents are slightly douchy, but that's just me.) I told her that I want something that is more earthy, but not bitter. She asked me some more questions and told me that I have what is usually called a more ""woody"" taste for scent. She let me smell some samples and I agreed with her. Ended up going with Calvin Klein Encounter, but don't take that as a suggestion for you. Everyone has different tastes.  
Also, if you don't already know this stuff, some other tips about wearing a scent:  
Find that one perfect fragrance for you, and use ONLY that. You should NOT have a variety of scents based on the situation or your mood. They are NOT like clothes. Your fragrance should serve as an subtle, pleasant, reminder of you. An unconscious reference, but it has to become that over time. That won't happen if you alternate scents. Do - not - alternate - scents.  
This is also one of the reasons why you shouldn't, unfortunately, go with the cheap scents like Old Spice or Preferred Stock, etc. I'm not a snob. I think they smell ok. They're a little harsh, but classic. They're WAY too common, though. If you were to ever wear a common discount brand, a girl might think to herself ""he smells good today"", but she will never start that process of unconsciously associating a specific, unique scent to you. She will always smell old spice and think, ""that's old spice, it smells good."" But YOU probably won't pop up in her mind.  
Wear your scent every single day. Only a little, just behind the earlobes and upper neck. One or two sprays at the most. When you first apply a scent, you will notice the smell of it. If after 10 or 15 minutes, you (the wearer) are still noticing it, you are wearing too much. Remember that your scent should be a subtle, pleasant reminder of you. It's phycological. Not something people should consciously notice (unless they get very close).  
A couple months back a couple of (male) coworkers were talking about a cologne that one of them just bought. They asked me if I wore anything. I told them I wear Encounter, and I always keep a tiny little card spray (a little flat sample-size) in my desk in case I have to work late. I let one of them sample a bit on their wrist, because they were interested.  
They said ""Holy crap. This is Reas0n. It's like they took what Reas0n smells like and put it in a cologne. This is so weird. Dude, smell this.""  
It's funny because, of course, the opposite is true. That's what you want to be going for, though.  
Man, I really over-answered your question. Sorry. :P

"I love my [OtterBox Symmetry](http://www.otterbox.com/en-us/iphone-6/symmetry-series-case/apl28-amp600.html) case! It bears the OtterBox goodies and it is slim and protective! I've dropped it before and although it hit the back corner, it didn't hit my phone and my case bore a scar, but hey... Battle scars shows just how useful this case was! :)

EDIT: I love black/white combos and since my iPhone is silver/white, the black case was perfect. In addition, since I scratched my case due to a drop, I just had to remove some of the shaved parts that came off the case (not a lot), and since it's black you can't see the scratch.

EDIT 2: When I said ""goodies"" I meant their customer service is great. At least for that one time I dealt with them (and the only time I've done a warranty claim ever in my life). I got another case from them almost immediately in several e-mail exchanges (partly due to my mistake of accidentally sending two warranty claim e-mails)."
"I'm doing the Sierra Blue Pro Max, and for the short term, I'm going to try out the Apple MagSafe Silicone Blue Jay case.  I've ordered a Moment MagSafe Indigo case.  1. Because this case has done fantastic on my 12 PM.  2. Because I also sometimes use the Moment lenses with my phone!

I've also got an Otterbox Amplify screen protector on the way.  That, too, has done great in protecting my 12 PM!"
I've heard about the coil whine but I wasn't aware there were other issues. Thanks for the heads up.
Thanks. I made the correction.

I like well-written characters: not too dramatic, human in the sense that they're complex (not just black or white) but are consistent with their character. The setting would either be a complex universe or, if set in a smaller scope then as long as what is needed for the story is included. I prefer comedy, action, and realism as genre. 

Appealing art-style is a must (Lancelot & others, all hail Murata-sama, Chitanda kawaii~ ""Watashi kininarimasu"", great action scenes, and expressive/hilarious faces). 

Profound, meaningful, relatable, and witty moments/dialogues/lines are part of it, too. Catchy soundtracks are a big plus."
I'm Sorry
