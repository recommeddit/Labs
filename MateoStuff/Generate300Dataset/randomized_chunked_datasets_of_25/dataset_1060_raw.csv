"I came to the same consensus after our honeymoon.  While it's nice to not have to worry about money while on the trip, I don't think it was worth the added expense.  I believe I could've received comparable service and drinks for the same cost at a non-inclusive resort.  Also, I know I would have received much better food.

However, when traveling on hotel points I prefer the all inclusive resorts because I don't have to worry about spending money on food or drinks."
"Oatmeal, spoonful of peanut butter and add boiling water. Taa daa! Easy, cheap, filling and yummy"
"May be personal taste, because I never see anyone mention it in these topics: Blackout!

It's just great front to back. Personally I put it up with Illmatic, Doggystyle, MBDTF, GKMC, Buhloone Mindstate, Grandmasters, etc., for consistently great albums with few skippable tracks."
"The definition of ""center"" [changes over time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realigning_election#Voter_realignment).  It's also subjective -- many people rate their own position as closer to the center than other people would rate them.  (see: /r/badpolitics charts)"
"Came to say Hocking Hills, any of the trails are impressive. OMC gets too crowded at times, but I'm picky. I like taking pictures and try to avoid getting other people in the shot. 

If you're seeking an experience consider an Ohio State home game."
Nice!!
favorite is not synonymous with best

Is this something we can update on the Megathread?
"I've seen that list before.  It's a pretty good list.  I wish he would make a new list for the 2010s, but I suppose I'll have to do it myself."
"Loosely related, but if you're looking to add any Audio equipment to your home (indoors or outdoors), [Parts Express](https://partsexpress.com) is a great place to start."

Overall Spigen is my favorite."
If you're going for white just use primer. It's cheaper and does the same thing

"The Strugatskys are unjustly neglected.  I've only read *Roadside Picnic* (because of Tarkovsky's *Stalker*) and it was great, but their books can be hard to find.

Whereas Lem is at least available. *The Cyberiad* and *Solaris* are must-reads"
"If it's about drugs, probably smart"
"Babyface Ray - *Unfuckwitable* is pretty good but not best of the year good.

My favorite Detroit tapes are Vezzo's and Molly Brazy's (honestly haven't gotten around to Dugg but I bet that one's good)

I'm waiting on Sada or Lonnie they always deliver"
