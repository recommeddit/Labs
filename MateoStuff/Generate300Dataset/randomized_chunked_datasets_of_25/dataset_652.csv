57302,"This reminds me of a story about Dasani.

In August 2019 (almost exactly two years ago), my sister passed away. We opted to cremate her, so the funeral home got her dressed for us to see her one more time.

My other sister, my aunt (my mom was in jail at the time) and I all went to the viewing. When we saw her, it was unreal, almost literally. The funeral home didn't ask for any pictures of her so they dressed her in a way they thought we would like: curly hair, bronzer, makeup, black dress. My sister was a red headed, pale freckle faced hippie. It looked absolutely nothing like her, and we were upset about that, but more importantly we needed to grieve.

As we're crying and holding one another, the funeral director decided to hand us Dasani water. Not sure why she decided at that point to hand out water. It was the worst water I had ever tasted, and really put the cherry on top of the whole experience.

We ended up being comped the rest of our bill for the service, and the funeral director had been fired for unrelated reasons.",best water brand

27136,"The base game is pretty easy, but the expansions definitely help. The old standard was to recommend picking up Dark City (if you could find it) to increase the challenge, but I think Xmen is pretty good bang for the buck as well.

However...none of the expansions really change the basic flow of the game dramatically, so if you don’t see any potential to the base game, I’m not sure it’s worth throwing more money at it. If it wasn’t a Marvel game, I doubt I would have moved beyond the base game, but the IP hooked me.",best board games
