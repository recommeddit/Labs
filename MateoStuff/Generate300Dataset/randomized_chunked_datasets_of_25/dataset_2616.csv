Skate 2 always has that fisheye effect, or 'camera man mode' on Skate 3. I've noticed that on Skate 3 I get way better FPS with Camera man mode off than on, so that could be part of it. 

I really like the map in Skate 2, though.",best game console
4954,"Wayfair service is complete shit. I ordered a $1,000 table. Got half of it (the top and legs, none of the metal infrastructure that holds it together—different box). Called and told them. 

They shipped me the same fucking half I already had.

Called them and told them.

They shipped me the other half and did not pick up the other half.

Called them. They asked me to dispose of the table myself. The multi-hundred pound table in my small (lovingly cared-for, not cheap) car.

Like two *months* after this started, they finally had someone go there to pick it up. They basically took the desk and left all the fucking packing materials on my front porch. Literally opened the box, took the table, left everything else.

Holy fuckballs is Wayfair terrible.",best home improvement store

This is the fastest meal I could come up with, inspired by a hotel breakfast I got in Florida. Each item takes a minute or two to prepare. It's also pretty affordable and makes few dishes. You do need a toaster and microwave though.",best breakfast foods

53010,"people really sleeping on that Van Buren Records project. If anyone is on the fence/not sure if they'd like it, here's what Passion of the Weiss wrote about it:

>One of the most talked-about Massachusetts hip-hop acts this year has been Van Buren Records, a collective based out of Brockton. They’ve received co-signs from the biggest names in MA rap and beyond, and for good reason. Some of the individual members have shown tremendous promise. Lord Felix, who dons a large mirrored visor when performing, put out several projects this year that showcase a knack for house-influenced rap. And Jiles projects as a no-frills spitter. His debut album Fuck Jiles has the ethos of a Jay Rock record.

>Others in Van Buren aren’t as far along in their careers. Saint Lyor has only two songs to his name, but he’s clearly onto something. The second one, “Gossip,” might be one of the best songs that anyone in the crew has recorded. It has the feel of a Baby Keem song, but it’s more believable than anything Keem has done. The whole crew pulled up to the video shoot at Brockton High School and clearly had fun with it. Check for Van Buren all 2020.",best hiphop album

Imo In five years there will be little reason to choose anything else for a general runabout.
