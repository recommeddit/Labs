69211,best major to study in college,"This is an intriguing topic. I find that many people are practically blind to the effects of chance on their own lives, in particular, with regard to their own success. You are obviously right about some of the ways that people can improve their odds of doing well (or at least expand the range of possible outcomes). 

But one interesting quirk is that the magnitude of the resulting success is often wildly dependent on 'luck.' You might think of this is as the luck of the luck.

The billionaire, the 10 millionaire, and the guy who earns $300k a year from his small company might have engaged in an identical level of the kind of actions that you have described (good choices, risk taking, bucking conventional wisdom, making their own luck, etc.) Perhaps the guy with the small company is the boldest, most inventive, and cleverest of the three. It is unlikely that the billionaire was a few thousand times 'better' than the last guy. It's more likely that he was a few thousand times luckier. 

Some people see this analysis as so obvious as to be not worth discussing, but others are deeply offended by it.

So I agree, 'luck' is an oversimplification, but not wrong. In the end I think that, over a certain threshold, the effects of luck dwarf the effects of behavior because of the asymmetrical upside."

8995,best toothpaste,"A quick [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_poisoning) search reports:

>Referring to a common salt of fluoride, sodium fluoride (NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).

Equating sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate for convenience, and considering the 0.76% concentration of the latter in one commercial toothpaste, you'd have to swallow a little over 650 mL of the stuff at the low end to reach toxic levels (I know I'm mixing volume and mass here, but this is just really quick and dirty). That's 6 and a half regular-sized tubes. That's a *lot* of toothpaste, and considering that fluoride often produces stomach pains at a 15th or a 20th of toxic levels, it seems pretty unlikely that this is something you'd do by accident.

Basically, swallowing toothpaste is probably a bad idea generally, just because it's not really meant to be swallowed and you don't seem to gain by the act. However, it seems to be exceedingly unlikely that you'll end up with more than a tummyache or diarrhea, unless you're downing the stuff like spray-cheese."

54799,best water filter,"depends

do you want taste filtering or acutally cleaning?

Acutall cleaning a Berkey  gravity fed can do well,high initial cost  of $300 or(buy the filters for 110 and build your own chamber) but filter cost is good since $110 = 6000 gallons

for just taste the cheapest pitcher you can find,walmart and target sell their own filter replacements for picthers too"
