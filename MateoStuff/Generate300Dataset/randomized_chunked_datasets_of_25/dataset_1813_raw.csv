I don't think Hitler's ego would have allowed him moderation in terms of expansion.
"Yup, 100% this my dude.

I really wonder if the people arguing with me were patented at all."
Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo in Sicily is on par with this.
"I was thinking of writing a well thought out response to your comment, but I decided not to. Nothing I, or anyone for that matter, say will sway your thoughts towards people who read the Bible."
"Plain oatmeal.  I use quick oats.  Mix the oats and water and a little salt.  Stir.  Break an egg on top, but don't stir.  Nuke for a minute and a half.  Check, stir around the edges.  Nuke for about 30 seconds more.  Your microwave will vary."

I can't belive I had to scroll so far down for this.
I haven't done Twisted Cyclone or Wonder Woman but I've done Railblazer and I liked Iron Rattler better than that. I also likes Iron Rattler better than Steel Vengeance and Twisted Colossus. Maybe I just got it on a really good couple of days but the first drop is my 2nd favorite drop on a coaster after X2 and the dive off the quarry wall is one of my favorite elements on an RMC. I liked the pacing of the ride and it's one of the few rides that I've gone into with really high expectations and still walked away from impressed.
"There are plenty of very liberal small towns in the US, in just about every state. Stay away from the bible belt and you're fine. What rights is he taking away? My life has literally not changed in the slightest since he became president. Also, who the fuck said it was the best country in the world?"
"It has its own style, no title bar, no menu bar. Programs should not have non-standard interfaces, that's bad design."
Geography
I really like the ones from Xiron on Amazon.  I've tried to get used to writing without a matte screen protector but can't get used to the feel.  I've used this on one as well as my families and they are all happy with the writing feel with them.
I always thought this job was pretty interesting. It's something everyone in modern society relies on without even realizing it. I considered it when I was in highschool for the insane job security.
Thanks a lot for planting this image in my head
"The twist being that she was switched when she was young? That's what crumbled the movie for me and a lot of people. Questions arise like; Why didn't she just leave the underground? She knew how to get down there she would know how to escape. Where did they all get the red jumpsuits perfectly tailored for their size? Instead of killing normal people, why didn't they escape and just cause a media circus to expose what was happening underground? What were the motivations for the people underground to kill their doppelgangers in the first place? What the hell was the point of revealing that the people underground control the behaviors above ground? Wouldn't that mean, if one doppelganger chose to run away, the other would run away too? What was the point to have the people underground laugh and scream like monsters?

The movie is so full of plot holes it's crazy.  It's a sad excuse as a social commentary horror movie."
"[Derezzed : The Glitch Mob/Daft Punk Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_MSyrq6-U) This is my favorite ""in the zone"" push out reps song. At about 45 seconds it times perfectly with my reps."

People say it's just one big black mirror but tbh I literally didn't see that twist coming damn beautiful film!"

"Better question would be if you need one. Unless you live in Flint, the tap water is probably so clean that it doesn't need filtering. Your municipal water utility should have quality tests on file."

Been an Xbox guy since the original. Halo was a wow landmark moment for me when i first played it. And i was set on an Xbox when Microsoft acquired Rare.
