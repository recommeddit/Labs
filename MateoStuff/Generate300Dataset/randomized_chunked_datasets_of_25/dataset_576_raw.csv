Go see The Kid Who Would be King. It's bombing while you're not seeing it.
The trade-off is worth it. 1440p is stunning.
Ditto! It cures what ails ya!

"I really need help picking between 21.5 (22) inch and 24 inch monitors for my dual monitor + laptop setup (the laptop will most likely be used with the lid closed). In either case I would go with BenQ GW__80 monitors. I received the 24 inch model yesterday and while the monitor themselves are absolutely great I can't help but wonder if 24 inch dual monitors is a bit overkill. They take a large footprint on my Ikea Malm desk. Maybe getting arms or a stand would help? Anyway, because I'm so unsure, I also ordered the 22 inch model this morning.

What do you guys think? What has your experience been with dual monitors of various sizes? Keep in mind, my setup up until yesterday was a 17 inch laptop on a stand next to a 21.5 Samsung TV on a stand as well."
How did you find out so fast? Did you set an alert of some kind or just checked randomly?
Top of the list for me is probably LeGuin's *The Left Hand of Darkness*
"Black eyed Susan’s can be made pretty strong and if you use a recipe with pineapple as well as oj you shouldn’t taste much

On the same note, a lot of rum drinks don’t taste too boozy if you make them well and don’t buy bottom of the barrel rum"
"Exactly man, like, I have a Ryzen 3600 with 16gb of ram and I can stream any games nearly perfect. And some people WILL TELL YOU you need at least a Ryzen 7 3700x + 32gb of ram, or a RTX Video card, to use as a stream encoder."
Yeah I dont normally like drinking more than one it makes me feel shitty ive been on those c4s for a while now and just seen the ghost today and liked the flavor and was curious to see if there was healthier ones or better ones in general but thanks for the info
"My parents covered my housing costs for college and I covered tuition via loans and scholarships. You might be able to do some similar cost splitting to make college more affordable for you. Taking a year or two at community colleges isn't a bad idea at all, especially if your kids aren't 100% certain what they want to do.

My living costs in college were about $1000/month and my tuition at Cal Poly was about $6k per year. It's still a pretty chunk of change, but if your kids go to a CSU and have a part time job, it might be affordable enough."
"I got a degree in Film; against the advice of most friends and family. After a year and a half of food service jobs I've been working in the film/TV industry for over 2 years now. Both casting for several notable TV series and movies (Warner Bros, HBO, NBC, CW) and working hands on on-set for several feature films and TV shows (Dark Knight Rises, Walter Mitty, Law and Order SVU, Girls, Amazing Spider-Man 2, etc) 

My only main issue is that I'm already jaded by the way the industry works as a whole. And it may be too late to find another industry to work in (would love to work in Video Games)."

Have both 36s and 37s. Definitely feel like the 37s push you to be up front more and get you going faster.
"What I remember from school, though I'm sure it wasn't the only thing I was taught, was pointing out all the different military officers and what they did because they were all going to show up in the civil war.

I always thought of the Mexican-American war as one of those precursor wars like the Spanish civil war to world war II"

"Vulture is a solid pub and I also have followed the author on Twitter for a while and know she reads a pretty big variety of titles, and is a big fan of the genre too, which is why I'm so surprised this list is so ... boring, haha."

"Some plants can grow a lot in one season (like beans, sunflowers, morning glories, etc) but not trees."
"Unfortunately, a lot of the time, a specific configuration is only available at one place, so I believe that you're only going to find that at Amazon."
