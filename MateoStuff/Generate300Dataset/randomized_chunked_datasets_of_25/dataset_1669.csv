56642,"I'm interested in a 4k G-SYNC display, preferably with refresh at least up to 144Hz. The reason is I plan to keep upgrading my gfx card (currently 1080Ti for display, and extras doing processing).. and although I'm most concerned with productivity uses, I like high refresh rates and occasionally game.

I believe a few such displays exist - and sometimes can be had for under $1000 - but I haven't seen a lot mentioned about them, since they're still kind of niche. Some detail I'd be interested in is e.g.: sure it's G-SYNC, but are these displays actually able to drive 4K at 144Hz? Even if I could see my mouse cursor and dragged windows looking smooth on the desktop, that's important in terms of being satisfied. Otherwise it'd be an expensive disappointment.",best desktop monitor

32442,"Depends on what you are looking for. If you are not going to leave the resort to sightsee/explore then it doesnt matter what country you go to, look for the resort that gives you the most of what you want. IF you are a foodie look for lots of restaurants, if you are a beach person get a great , long, seaweed free beach with enough loungers so you dont have to wake up at 5am to save them, if you like to party get a resort that has sister resorts closeby that all use the same disco so there is always nightlife.

Some of my favourites. Majestic Mirage/Elegance or Colonial in Punta Cana, Sandos Playacar in Playa Del Carmen, Barcelo Maya Colonial Riviera Maya, Hard Rock Riviera Maya.",best vacation resort
