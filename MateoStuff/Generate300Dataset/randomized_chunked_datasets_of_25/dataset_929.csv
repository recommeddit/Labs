61127,Best comedy show on Netflix,"**Life**: Only two seasons, but fantastic dialogue and acting throughout.

**Blacklist**: The writing is top shelf plus you get James Spader at his darkest.

**Misfits**: Probably my favorite television show ever. Many have said that the show loses too much after the cast changes begin in series 3, but I'm a huge fan of the differences between them all and think it works for the story."
73642,best battery bank,"That might be exactly what I’m looking for, thx."
54922,best water filter,"I've seen both Pepsi and Coke's branded waters (aquafina, dasani respectively) both state (in various places) that they incorporate at least one reverse osmosis step. I suspect that they are just bottling the same feedstock water that they use for soft drink production. While it might be ""expensive,"" they still do it; bottled water is not any cheaper than soft drinks, despite omitting many flavours and carbonation steps.

29323,best game console,"NES. It singlehandedly revived  the Global videogame industry after the crash of '83. Add that to the sheer density of titles that span every genre, as well as its constantly evolving graphical capability that helped it compete with both the Atari 2600 and the Sega Master System, it is simply the most historically significant system ever. 




....Also Super Mario Brothers 3."

68460,best science fiction novel,"When you read Heinlein's Stranger in a strange land, did you read the original published version, or the uncensored version that was published after his death?  Homosexuality was not a theme to deal with in the early 1960s, at least in Science Fiction, so Heinlein had to do a bit of trimming.

I've read several on that list, started some others, and, never even heard of many, but they do look interesting."

60314,best freezer brand,"Yes! We buy a whole side of beef every year and split it with my brother. Comes out to about $2 a pound, which is a lot for ground beef but very cheap for porterhouse, so I think it averages out. 

Also, see if the butcher will break it down for you into at least smaller cuts."
44298,best items under $100,"Not bad, seems like everyone else I know is forking over $200-300 a month for just themselves, and that's with a group rate through their employer."

54555,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"No way! You're going to love the otsu v2! IMO it's the best of both the hien (speed) and zero (control). You're probably missing just a hair of speed the hien can offer, but that difference is very minimal yet you're gaining a good amount of control!

What density did you choose?"

46780,best hand santizer brand,"My work has distributed hand gel with 85% concentration, but hey, we're in the vodka belt, we like the stronger stuff.

Clarification: I'm not directly comparing the alcohol concentration of vodka with that of hand disinfection."
26551,best board games,I agree. My into game has been Desert for a few years now and it’s been way more successful than anything I’ve used before. I don’t even own a copy of Pandemic anymore. Desert is just game even my veteran gaming friends suggest pulling out from time to time.
45973,best trick or treating candy,Bite-size Snickers - somehow more tasty to me than the normal size
72381,best keyboard switches,"Get yourself some Invyr Panda housings and create Holy Pandas with your halo true stems.

Or get yourself some greetech razer switches or greetech RGB greens/blues and create Holy Razers with your halo true stems.

Or get Outemu Ice v2 dark purples and create Salmon on Ice with your your halo true stems.

There is no objectively best tactile switch, as this hobby is basically all subjective preference, but it's no mystery that meme switches created with the Halo stems are are a community favorite for tactiles. People will argue otherwise and shame the meme switches, but the second anyone makes a 'Sell' thread over on /r/mechmarket that has either Halo's or Pandas, everyone shits themselves and starts watering at the mouth."
16000,best sunglasses for fashion,"I love Celine for sunglasses. They're so expensive but sometimes you can get pretty cheap ones on EBay.

I also have the round Ray-Bans that everyone is wearing right now and one oversized black Prada cat-eye for when I don't want to be seen by anyone."
