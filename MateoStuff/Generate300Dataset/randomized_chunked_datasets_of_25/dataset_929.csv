**Blacklist**: The writing is top shelf plus you get James Spader at his darkest.

**Misfits**: Probably my favorite television show ever. Many have said that the show loses too much after the cast changes begin in series 3, but I'm a huge fan of the differences between them all and think it works for the story.",Best comedy show on Netflix

54922,"I've seen both Pepsi and Coke's branded waters (aquafina, dasani respectively) both state (in various places) that they incorporate at least one reverse osmosis step.

Homosexuality was not a theme to deal with in the early 1960s, at least in Science Fiction, so Heinlein had to do a bit of trimming.
