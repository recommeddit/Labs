16253,best sunglasses for fashion,I buy knock-off rayban wayfarers off Amazon by the dozen for $25.  I would never buy real ones and don’t support the concept of licensing out styles to Lux.
60205,best freezer brand,"For some reason I've been getting tons. I just call GE, report the model and since they don't make parts for them they just offer a new one.

31824,best hotel to live in,"i can't believe you can last as long as years. i only did 3 or 4 months and felt destroyed by the ordeal. i'm not sure what the problem was, as looking at my life now - a single guy alone in an apartment, it's not that different.

maybe you could do what one of the other posters suggested, and ask for a serviced apartment. at least then you wouldn't have to tell any prospective girls that you were only there temporarily, right away. ;)"

51644,best iphone case,"I always get the black Apple leather but I’m thinking of going with the Saddle Brown this year.

The black is great because it holds up really well over time. I love the look of the Saddle Brown but I’ve been hesitant to get it because I’m worried it might look like crap after a while.

Anyone own one? How does Saddle Brown stand up after a year?"
