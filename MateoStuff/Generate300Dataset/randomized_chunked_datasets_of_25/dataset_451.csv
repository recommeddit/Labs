25999,best politician,"I think most politicians in the American West tend to be less corrupt, on both the left and the right.

For example, I think the recent governors of Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico are honest people. On the right, I think Gary Johnson is a true believer in what he says and an honest broker who isn't corruptible. On the center left, I think John Hickenlooper is fair-minded and reasonable. He'll listen to opposing voices. On the left, I don't think anyone can seriously accuse Kate Brown of corruption.

I think most of America's corruption comes from the deep South on the right and the big city political machines on the left. I think corruption is more regional than ideological. Having said that, on a national level, I think the current Congress and President are undoubtedly the most corrupt in at least 100 years."

36866,best roller coaster at six flags,"That’s not true. The Chillers last season was 2007. It was demolished after the 2007 season ended, and the Dark Knight coaster was then constructed and opened in the beginning of the 2008 season in May.

No denying Chiller was unreliable, which ultimately led to its demise, but The Dark Knight was very much its replacement. The chiller ran throughout 2017, they even made a change to the layout between 2006 and 2007 to try and get the ride to run better for the 2007 season. Batman side hardly ran in 2007, but Robin side was running most of the time. I don’t know why your saying is was out of commission long before TDK when it was running right up until they demolished it and replace it with TDK..and there was only 6 months between the time the Chiller closed permanently and TDK was fully built and open."

15675,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have several pairs of Ray\-Bans in this and absolutely recommend the sub $100 Ray\-Bans, which usually means it will have their classic G15 lens. I also have some Original Wayfarers with polarized lenses that seems poorly done \(but have more expensive Ray\-Bans where the polarized lenses are great\), so if you're going below $100, go non\-polarized or at least test the polarized ones before you buy."

12117,best gifts for dad,"I swear I'm going to impose a hard moratorium on gift buying for me because I'm exactly the same way. My mom will buy me clothes under the presumption of ""you can exchange it if you don't like it or it doesn't fit"" but that's a whole ordeal unto itself that I don't want to deal with in the first place. Same goes for useless knickknacks that clutter up my shit. Give me cash or nothing at all--I already know I'm picky as fuck.

Though if you want to gift me something, gift me cigars. I like those."
72602,best keyboard switches,"To be honest, I would get whichever switch suits you. Be warned though, I would go for the tactile silent: the clicky ones sound like machine guns at night but you still want that tactile feel. If you want full stealth at night (membrane is best but there are ones where it's more like a USP-S instead of a machine gun) then you have to sacrifice the tactile feel (the bump when you press down on the key)"

73783,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Whatever you prefer. 

If you have an Apple Pencil and use it a lot, you may want a screen protector, otherwise, the screen itself is very durable from scratches, and you don't really need one. 

For me, I can't stand glare, so I have a matte screen protector to reduce glare. Great screen quality doesn't mean shit if there's a giant glare on your screen. 

Moreover, my two primary uses for my iPad are digital art and reading comics. 

It feels almost like I'm reading an actual paper comic with my matte screen protector. It doesn't reduce the quality of the image, but it does give it a slightly different quality. 

As for art, I use the apple pencil a lot. The Matte screen protector makes the friction feel better and more like drawing on paper. 

In conclusion, it's all preference. 

Do you like the look of matte or glossy displays better? 

If you like matte: get a matte screen protector. 

If you like glossy: Get a glossy, tempered glass screen protector if you use the apple pencil, and leave it bare if you don't."
