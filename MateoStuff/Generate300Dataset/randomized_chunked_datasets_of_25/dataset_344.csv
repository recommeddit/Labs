16202,best sunglasses for fashion,"I was in the same place you were a few months ago.  [Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/Men/Accessories/Sunglasses%20&%20Eyewear)  proved to be the solution.  Went on their website and got $200 sunglasses from Electric California for $35.  They are worlds better than any other sunglasses I‚Äôve had, even my (now-broken) Ray-Bans.  Most of the stuff you find on the Rack is extremely high quality because it‚Äôs liquidated/out-of-season products that are originally from Nordstrom.  In other words, you can get these $200 designer, fully-polarized shades for <$40 shipped.  I recently suggested some from [Timberland](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/search?query=Timberland+sunglasses), who are known for quality products."
