EDIT: Found this site: https://timhi.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/ajax-1995/ You can see OP's pic as well as the tactics when Ajax played Milan in the CL group stage of the 94-95 season.

53268,"With pretty limited info on how you use your cables, it's hard to say what to do differently exactly. But, what I do differently from my past is I basically don't use my phone while it's charging. If I need to do something, I'll just unplug it and plug it back in when I'm done. Also, if I do use it while charging, I just do my best to be careful around the end of the cable, no bending of the cable unless it like 4 or so inches away from the end. If the cable is long enough, I'll hold the the cable against the back of the phone in my hand so the bend is like 4-6 inches up the cable, and the end coming out of my phone is straight for at least an inch and a half or so.

There are a bunch of tiny string like wires soldered to individual pins on the plug, if it gets bent next to the plug, eventually the tiny copper just breaks off the pin and the cable is trash unless you resolder. That's the main point you need to be careful of, on both ends of the cable.

Also: I always plug and unplug cables holding the head, never pulling the cable out of my phone by pulling the actual cord, only while holding the end piece.",best usb c charging cable

You can download Forza 6: Apex for free. Its the F2P - gutted version of Forza 6 and it should be able to let you get a feel for how the game is and it runs really well IMO.

You'll have to get Forza through the Windows App store though. Apex is PC only, Forza 6 through the App Store has an Xbox Only version, and a ""Play Anywhere"" version where you play on PC and Xbone. Get the Play Anywhere version.",best car racing video game
