"Uhm in my country the 10700f is cheaper than the 5600x, so I'd rather go for that one"
I keep mine far away.. with the wide angle lense the c920 can make your face look wider than it is if it's too close . I just use the zoom feature to get closer in.

"Don't worry about it. I used to feel this way when I was younger. I just didn't have the life experience to understand how things really are because I had been lucky enough to have a secure upbringing and made plenty of money for myself at that time. I attributed poverty to being lazy and hard work means being secure and not having to receive financial aid. Until, life decided to teach me a lesson and I became one of those people I used to judge, even though I still worked hard, had a degree, etc. There went that old viewpoint, along with a lot of pride and dignity. It was hard, but I learned a valuable lesson about never judging people if I haven't walked in their shoes. People like to think it would never happen to them because they work *hard*, they put in effort to better themselves, they went to school, they didn't have kids they couldn't support but what happens when you realize that someone just like that can, by no fault of their own, end up down and out? It could be them in a week and they don't even realize it."
Science huh?
"I agree. I must add that the dialogues are sometimes cringe and dumb, with a main character that nods instead of speaking and a story not original at all.

But the game is extremely fun and takes the J-RPG classic formula to a new level :)"
"That's probably why. Apparently, the unspoken rule is to format your lennies like the following:

>How old is she?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"It comes after the 'Deck Phase' and before the 'Pagoda Phase'. Don't worry, its coming."
"It's probably the best RPG of the last decade, but it's just an RPG, and doesn't have side mechanics to make gameplay more engaging, so it could be iffy to get into.
Nothing quite like it on the market."
This cost you substantially more than 100.
"Great replacment for Statistics 101: [The Art of Data Analysis: How to Answer Almost Any Question Using Basic Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Data-Analysis-Question-Statistics/dp/1118411315) by Kristin H. Jarman.

Book was hilarious.. She uses Data Analysisfor a bunch of hilarious tasks. For example running a frequency distribution on “Yo Momma"" Jokes”on the net or uses probability to jokingly track Big Foot.

[Frequency Distribution of Yo Momma Jokes](https://imgur.com/a/anjE3ft)

Back to Big Foot, she uses probability to figure out everything on her Bigfoot search from buying the right camera to the ‘best places to look.’ It’s hilarious.

>I quit my job and head off in search of the creature. With visions of fame and fortune running through my head, I cash in my savings, say goodbye to my family, and drive away in my newly purchased vintage mini\-bus.

>As I leave the city limits, my thoughts turn to the task ahead. Bigfoot exists, there’s no doubt about it. He’s out there, waiting to be discovered. And who better than a statistician\-turned\-monster\-hunter to discover him? I’ve got scientific objectivity, some newly acquired free time, and a really good GPS from Sergeant Bub’s Army Surplus store.  
>  
>It’s too late to get my job back, and my husband isn’t taking my calls, so it seems I have no choice but to continue my search. I decide I’m going to do it right. I may never find the proof I’m looking for, but I’ll give it my best, most scientific effort. Whatever evidence I find will stand up to the scrutiny of my ex\-boss, my family, and all those newspaper reporters who’ll be pounding on my door, begging for interviews."
Cherry Amp. Had one nearly every day as an undergrad and it got me through mountains of work. Haven’t seen it in a long time.
Do you need to rootfs the previous jailbreak for this to work?
"A slow cooker.  15-30 minutes of prep at 10 AM, a week's worth of meals at 5 PM."

"I was going to mention this, but OP wanted Udemy.
But, epic react does come up time and again as a highly recommended course."
"Yeah, but how much was that counter?"
"This is amazing man, i feel like im reading myself since we are so alike, the one thing i'd correct and please dont kill me, i know ff vii is arguably the goat but the game did not age well, i beat it when i was a kid and playing it again as a grown up was a constant: how did i get through this?. Im curretnyl playing world of final fantasy and the whole mako level was such a joy to play, i got a smile on my face the whole time.
Also, give Nier a try, i loved it so that means you'll love it too"
"Whenever I've needed Hardware such a screws or light switches or wall plates or caulk, there is always a larger selection at Home Depot, so I just don't bother going to Lowe's for that kind of stuff. Now things like light fixtures, I might try Lowe's first."
Mail me some please and thanks
Malibu + coke
"To me, it's the Diablo style gameplay loop that brings you back,+ Soulsbourne style combat / boss fights (though significantly easier) where you have to learn the attack patterns to succeed. Add in that each weapon plays entirely differently and that's a ton of hours"
