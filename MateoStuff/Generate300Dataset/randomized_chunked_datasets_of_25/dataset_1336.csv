54695,"> Just wondering, do you replace them when the light comes on, or do you let them go a bit longer? Mine comes on way more often than 4x a year. I'll usually go a few weeks after before replacing.

I go until I can tell a taste difference, probably not the best method. The red light is probably on for a month or so before I decide to replace. I feel like the light works off of some internal timer which has no measure of how much volume of water filtered in that time, so I guess that's how I justify it.",best water filter

22373,I was working in a little boutique store in Seattle with my girlfriend and it was a particularly slow day when all of a sudden Robin Williams walks through the door. He was the only one in the store and my girlfriend didn’t know who he was. We left him alone and when he came up to purchase his things he started barking at my Boston terrier in a cute way. It scared the crap out of my Boston terrier and he started barking back at Robin. He was so genuine and nice and I really do remember how hairy his arms were. For some reason that really stuck out. He walked out the door and instantly was surrounded by a bunch of tourists trying to take pictures of him. He put his bags in the back of his mini Cooper and drove off. He bought a little piece of artwork and three Goorin Bros hats.,best celebrity
