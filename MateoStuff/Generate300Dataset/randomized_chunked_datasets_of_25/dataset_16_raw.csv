What app is the best for 2 people to use? I want to do YNAB but it would be really helpful to have something cloud based I guess for both my wife & I.

"iPhone X is my favorite iPhone of al time, I love the silver on it and just the general design of it, I currently have the 11 and miss my X. 

Least favorite would probably be the 2016 SE. The Iphone 5 body is way too small for a 2016 phone"
"Thank you for this information. Do you also have an opinion on switching meds to take them sooner?

I might take one that I can not take again for 12 hours. So,  I'll take one with a different active ingredient if I start feeling poorly again in 8 hours."
"Had same shit happen recently. Not with me, but with a full load of CRW that hopped out before us. We had to do a go-around for traffic. After everyone landed, CRW leader told me that they saw bunch of meat bombs flying past them. Second plane caught up... ugh."

I don't really consider them the same as other french teams. They win because they have a lot of money.
"The Type-C port on my 20,000 PD Anker power bank stopped working. They won't do warranty service on it, which makes sense as its a bit past the warranty period, but they won't do a paid repair either. The device isn't two years old yet. I really wish I could get it repaired, even out of pocket.

I had a 20,100 power bank of theirs that was Type-C without PD. I had to get that one replaced over they Type-C port too. I used to like Anker a lot, but their Type-C ports seem like a weak point. I'm giving RavPower a try now instead of Anker."
coherence is a good one for the list too! my favorite mind-bender movie.
Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun! How was Ireland when you visited?
"Not only can you unlock games you can unlock prices. If you look like you're buying in India the prices are way cheaper. My friend got Netflix for 3$

But yeah it's highly illegal. He also got warning when using warez-bb, switched to Windscribe and got a copywrite notice. No problem since he started using CyberGhost. No login= Nothing to log data to"
"Friend showed me this the other day, it made me laugh so hard.

You made the claim, you back it up.  Otherwise your claim collapses under its own weight.

The problem is: how many of these authors have degrees in physics or mathematics? I prefer that emphasis is placed on the science aspect of science fiction.
