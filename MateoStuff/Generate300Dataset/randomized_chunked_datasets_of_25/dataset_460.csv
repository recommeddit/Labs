One of my favorite movies (non-anime) is Dinner with Andre - it talks about the two possible stance on facing ""Life"" - that if the meaning of life is life itself, what do we make of it? Anyway, that movie is long and mostly just two guys talking. And most people hate it or ""don't get it."" For me, I adore it because if you allow yourself to imagine their words, chew and taste them, and reflect on them, the movie is brilliant. Of course, you try to show it to people who have never experience doubt towards their lives, they'd not understand it. Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain tries to answer the same question with a different answer, in a much more graphical way that most people are forced to open their eyes or they don't. Dinner with Andre is much more gentle and forgiving. It talks to you, but whether you listen or not is up to you.  

For LoGH, it's an epic that unfolds very slowly. If you are not enjoying them, come back later... 5-10 years later. I, too, tried to watch the series when I was a kid. And boy, I thought it was the most boring trash I've ever watched! I couldn't understand *why* it was recommended by so many people.  

Now that I've grown and experienced this world so much more, that I have failed, succeeded, loved, hated, betrayed and been betrayed, and see the reality of the world... the series speak to me. If you find yourself question the state of this world and your place in it chaos, you may want to watch LoGH again. Enjoy!",best anime

71373,"the ending of La-La-Land. A whole movie that plays as a classic romantic fantasy, genuinely romantic, it just shoots you to the MOON with love and happiness and magic and then....they don't end up together ----- wait no they do! ---- Wait no....they don't.

You watch that entire movie, the idea that it doesn't end on a kiss is an amazingly brave choice. especially after it gives you a montage of them having children and all of it...

Movie ends 5 seconds earlier with the smile it's a romantic classic, with the ending now it completely changes things. Best  / boldest plot twist I have seen in recent years, it stuck with me it was so unexpected
