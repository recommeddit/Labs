Don't underestimate the impact of Alexander's conquests. He brought Greek influence to a countless amount of civilizations and people, from Greece and Makedonia all the way to India. Ideas flowed from West to East, then back. The fusion of cultures was amazing and, I believe, unprecedented. 

Caesar's conquests certainly didn't have such a lasting impact."

Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. When Black Panther makes over a billion dollars and then dies in the next movie, it's just impossible to take seriously. When Bucky and Wanda were dusted, I was shocked and fully bought in. But then T'Challah vanished and I thought, ""Never mind, this will all be undone somehow."""

24568,best anime,"I'll do 5 television projects and 5 films.

**TV+**

1- ""Paranoia Agent""

Kon-sensei was something else as a creative force in Japanese animation. This series, the only one he was able to complete before his untimely death in 2010, is an experimental serial thriller that messes with perspective to the point that by the third installment, you won't be able to trust most any character account on the basis that the perspective presented could be so warped that 

2- ""BACCANO""

Simply some of the best narrative and character writing I've seen, like a coherent comic of errors, ambitions, and relationships culminating in some glorious hilarity as well as involving romances and criminal shenanigans. Hell, I rearranged one of the character's titles to make my MAL profile name. It's a big influence on me as an anime viewer.

3- ""MushiShi""

The atmosphere in this program is something unlike anything in western entertainment. The closest thing I can relate it to is a collection of melancholy folk tales one notch below Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The tales are effective, haunting, and very emotional. The density of the fog is something else.

4- ""Cowboy Bebop""

What could I possibly add to the endless paragraphs lauding this hybrid sci fi western romp that hasn't already been laid bare? Not much. That being said, this show does contain my single favorite parody of the original *ALIEN* in all of pop culture. Take that, Mel Brooks.

5- ""Tanaka-kun is always listless""

An odd choice, I'll admit. But my taste in comedy is especially fickle, and this slice of life is something that tickles my preferences perfectly. One of the moments in later episode involving gorilla rankings had me giggling for a good three minutes. The show has a lax pace and chill characterization to equate to the chill music scene on Spotify and YouTube radio. Good for slow days and easy smiles.

**Films**

1- *Mononoke-hime*

This movie singlehandedly graduated me from movie watcher to film student. One night, while my parents were at a conference, I watched this and *Spirited Away* in back to back ten-minute chunks on YouTube, and I was forever enraptured by the amount of detail and themes that Miyazaki-sensei had imbued his films with. ""No Cuts"" was my mantra for years afterward.

2- *Belladonna of Sadness*

Very few films transcend the mere realms of animation and reach that fabled description of pure art. The second entry in the Animerama trilogy is a sumptuous feast of archaic splendor and isolated desolation. The tale of a woman abused, crushed, thrown aside, and her eventual rise to power on her own terms, thanks to a little help from teh devil. The epilogue puts a stamp on the film's feminist trappings and makes for excellent conversational material after the film has finished playing.

3- *Metropolis*

Rintaro's riff on Fritz Lang and *Blade Runner* was another crowning achievement of my life as a film student in training. The final 10 minutes of this film tore my heart in twain and caused me much pain over the course of the next couple days. Tima and Kenichi'i are relationship goals.

4- *the Shape of Voice (A Silent Voice)*

*your name* is an excellent entry into the historical anime canon. This film deserved as much international attention, but due to some strange licensing scenarios, only just made it to the United States for viewing and sharing. Still waiting on that blu ray release. Shoko and Shoya make for one of the most dynamic and affecting relationships I've ever seen portrayed on screen, live action and animated.

5- *Tokyo Godfathers*

Kon-sensei was a magician behind the camera. This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever, dealing with strained family relations, outcasts of society, urban abandonment, and the endurance of humanity against the elements. It's also friggin hilarious and heartfelt. If you haven't, you absolutely must check this one out, regardless if it's Christmas or the depths of summer.

22443,best celebrity,"Ran into Gordon Ramsay with his daughter at the Tom's Coffee on Abbot Kinney in Venice Beach (yes, Tom's the shoe brand has a dope coffee shop). Didn't want to interrupt his day out with his daughter by asking him for a photo, so I just gave him a ""hey, chef"" to which he responded, ""hey how you going?"". Super nice dude when he's not expected to cuss people out and call them idiot sandwiches on tv!"
11101,best backpack for college,"Mostly I'd pack it to bursting with textbooks. The zippers would give before the fabric did, but the fabric was on its way, too. 

I never knew that I could return them for a free replacement, but I probably would still have bought new ones because I couldn't afford to wait around for a new backpack while still needing to go to class. 

I bought a Red Oxx C-Ruck last year and don't see myself ever buying a new backpack ever again. It even fits my 17"" laptop with ease and the only way I've ever heard anyone's managed to damage one is dragging it behind a car for a mile, resulting in a bit of fraying that was still replaced for free."
