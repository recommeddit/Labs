[The Taiping Rebellion](http://wsu.edu/~dee/CHING/TAIPING.HTM). 

Excerpts from that page: 

> In the Taiping rebellion alone, which lasted for twenty years, almost twenty to thirty million died as a direct result of the conflict. In fact, the period from 1850 to 1873 saw, as a result of rebellion, drought, and famine, the population of China drop by over sixty million people.

....
>Hung Hsiu-ch'üan was the son of a poor farmer near Canton. He was a promising young student, but repeatedly failed the civil service examination in Canton. After one such failure, he overheard a Christian missionary speaking and brought home several Christian treatises. The next year he again failed the exam and, according to some historians, had a nervous breakdown. Whatever happened, Hung had several visions in which an old man told him that people had stopped worshipping him and were worshipping demons; in another, the man appointed him as a slayer of demons. Hung believed that the man in the visions was God the Father and that a younger, middle aged man that visited him in visions was Jesus Christ, his Elder Brother. 

....
> The movement attracted followers for a variety of reasons. Western historians argue that the famines of the 1840's inspired the Chinese to join various movements that were successfully feeding and taking care of themselves. Chinese historians stress the anti-Manchu rhetoric of Hung's early movement. While the God Worshippers were dedicated to the destruction of idols and the stamping out of demon worship, it's clear that they felt that the Manchu rulers were the primary propagators of demon worship. In Hung's early philosophy, he seems to have arrived at the conclusion that the overthrow of the Manchus would help bring in the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. 

....
> The army itself was uncannily disciplined; after elaborate initiation rituals, Taiping believers became fanatically disciplined and devoted soldiers, willing to die without hesitation in God's cause against demonic forces. The army of the Taipings roared northward through the central Yangtze valley to Nanking.

....
> Believing that the Heavenly King should rule only by his divine virtue and not by active engagement in politics, Hung seems, in reality, to have grown steadily more unbalanced. Rather than dedicating himself to divine virtue, he plunged into the sensual pleasures of the palace and the sexual pleasures of the harem of women he had collected around himself. Hung's withdrawal from Taiping administration sent cracks all through the Taiping administration. 


This is why the current Chinese government is so hard on wacky sects like Falun Gong. 

tl;dr - Farm boy fails civil service exam 7 times, has nervous breakdown in which Jesus appears to him and says, ""You're my little brother, kick out these idolators."" He raises army, nearly overthrows China's emperor, but fails because he spends too much time getting sexed up by his harem."

40942,best instrument to play,"Sax sounds terrible, out of tune, reedy, and has so many overtones. It sounds like a car honking.

Flute has no tone, and is physically demanding and you hear it in the child’s air stream.

I would rather hear the flute.

Violin in the beginning though is rough."

48235,best color to paint with,"> most paint mfgrs have an entire white book

Which is kinda absurd, because the color seen will depend more on  the color of the shirt you're wearing in the room, and on the manufacturer and model of lightbulbs (and even the age of LED bulbs) in the room - than it will on the shade of the paint itself."

10973,best backpack for college,"I finished school ten years ago, so I don't know what the backpack situation is on campus these days, but I had good experiences with the two bags you currently have.  I used a black Jansport bag for the end of high school through college.  When I went to grad school I bought a black North Face Jester.  I subsequently bought a padded laptop sleeve to use with it.  It made it through four years of school.  I still have both and both are in good functioning shape. The Jansport is currently used to store my Nintendo Wii and PS2.  I use the North Face on day hikes occasionally or as an overnight bag."

Logi took a long time to release a mech keyboards that matched the features of their high end plastic frame and rubber dome keyboards; a lot of recent bose stuff doesn’t even natively support Bluetooth and their current lineup has incredibly minimal homekit features only recently got airplay and that’s probably only because their Bluetooth was so bad"
