37393,best amusement park,What's it like? I'm going there this October!
7513,best laptop for general use,"Doesn't work on mobile, fyi. It doesn't scroll cleanly"
60231,best freezer brand,Do yourself a favor and buy one on craigslist. People are buying them new all the time and then deciding they don't have the space for one. We got a nearly-new 22 cubic foot upright freezer for $75 because a soccer mom wanted the basement space back.
37835,best Marvel movie,"What do people like so much about Civil War? I think it's a fun movie, but not even close to the best Marvel movie. Shang-Chi is way better imo. Agree on Infinity War, though."
49018,best gaming monitor,It works with nvidia too for the last two gens!
53807,best medicine for a cold,"Hot wings, chili, night quil and sleep.  If you can handle it, put on 3-4 blankets and sweat it out."
67504,axios alternatives reddit,We used ‘fetch’ and ‘node-fetch’ respectively and transitioned to ‘axios’ after a couple of years. You start building the same kind of wrappers that these libraries provide...
44223,best items under $100,"I just ordered one.  I can't wait to get it, although I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it."
12430,best gifts for mom,"My mom was in the yearbook club when she was in high school, contributing lots of writing and photography that she was proud of. Around 30 years ago my dad accidentally threw out her yearbooks when they were moving. So one year for xmas I did a bunch of research online and managed to find a company that had a digital copy of her senior yearbook, and ordered a reprint. She cried when she opened it."
49525,best gaming monitor,There might be a different in response times. Gaming monitors usually have a 1ms response time where as a general monitor will have around a 5ms response time or sometimes even more than 5ms. This means that there will be a shorter time between when you left click and when you see the gun fire in a game on a gaming monitor than on a regular monitor however in reality it is hard to tell the difference. To do this and still keep the price down gaming monitors will often use a TN lcd panel which won't have as good color reproduction and contrast as a IPS lcd monitor which often have higher response times than TN panels. However if you want the best of both worlds you can still find IPS monitors with low response times but they cost more usually.
59765,best perfume,Doesn't exist. Subjective.
34709,best NFL player,"> We count NBA before their merger

We really don't. There's a reason nobody brings up Wilt in GOAT discussions. It's always MJ, Kareem and LeBron, and then some hipster always brings up Hakeem."
66941,best soccer team in the world,58
38217,best newspapers to read,"I think it's entirely possible to be accurate and biased.  A large part of political posturing is telling most of the facts in a way that makes your argument look good.  

A large contingent of voters in my very-liberal state turned on Public Option Healthcare when a running Republican accurately campaigned (and possibly blew out of proportion) that public healthcare could ""force a Christian doctor to provide abortions""... which is technically true for First Amendment reasons if that doctor worked at a public facility and an abortion was warranted for the situation.

You could say that was entirely accurate, but also rather biased the way it was portrayed.

I think unbiased low-accuracy information might be at least as reliable as biased high-accuracy information."
29917,best money managing app,My four year anniversary of using YNAB is this month.  Embracing budgeting through it has changed the way I look at money.  Debt free for the past 2.5 years.
28516,best breakfast foods,"Yup. No bread, pasta, beer, sugar, etc. I have lots of natural fats and dark leafy greens worked into it as well. Drink a TON of water and make sure you keep your electrolytes worked into your diet as well."
26216,best politician,"Cato the Younger was actually a pretty emo dude for the time. He'd never wear a ""fashionable"" toga, only the ""toga pulla"", which was a deep purple or black. It symbolized his mourning for the foundationary principles on which the Republican was built. He would be a strict Constitutionalist in modern America."
32252,best hotel to live in,"I had a surgeon come in and complain the microwave in his room wasn’t working.

Went up to check on it and he showed me how it wouldn’t turn on.

He opened the door
Put his coffee in
Set the time and hit go

Nothing... he didn’t shut the door.

They obviously work long days but damn."
68756,best science fiction novel,"In no particular order:

* Robots - Empire - Foundation by Asimov (I know that's more than one but it's a continuous story starting with iRobot)
* Brave New World by Huxley
* Number of the Best by Heinlein
* The Man Who Japed by Philip K Dick
* 1984 by Orwell
* Fahrenheit 451 by Bradbury
* Dune by Herbert (Just the books written by him)
* Green Town Series by Bradbury
* Mars Series by Kim Stanley Robinson
* Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K LeGuin"
34875,best NFL player,"That write up for Dalvin Cook is so sexy….good job u/Tripudelops.

Now that Dalvin has been ranked, I’ll say this for the final time:

The real travesty (I’ve said this in nearly every top 100 thread lol) is having only 1 TE and 2 RBs make an All Pro team, yet have 8 WRs with one of them being Cole Beasley. 

Waller should’ve made it with Kelce, and Cook should’ve made it with Henry and Kamara. 

Dalvin Cook was snubbed from an All Pro team after a 1900+ yard and 17 TD season, which is an accolade that greatly affects a player’s place in this game’s history, and all because the roster construction and voting system for All Pro teams are obviously flawed. I’m trying to get over it…..but it’s difficult."
8168,best toothpaste,Wut.
62192,Best RPG game on PS4,If you like darker game with a good story line you could check out a game called vampyre.
53579,best medicine for a cold,"Not sure why I was downvoted. I vaccinate my kids and when they need an antibiotic, they get it and we give them the full course.  Having seen the rise in antibiotic resistance, I would rather not take antibiotics unless needed in hopes they will do the job when we really need them to."
19348,best YouTube video,"I love Drew Gooden. He’s an ex-viner (road work ahead vine) but he does comedic commentary videos. He did a really good critique video of Lily Singh’s show as well as a hilarious review of Jake Paul’s tour. 

In the same vein, I also really enjoy Danny Gonzalez’s commentary videos as well as his DIY stuff that he did like imitating the bad ads on Facebook and Instagram as well as trying out crafts from 5 minute crafts and Troom Troom."
