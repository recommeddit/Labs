Around 30 years ago my dad accidentally threw out her yearbooks when they were moving. So one year for xmas I did a bunch of research online and managed to find a company that had a digital copy of her senior yearbook, and ordered a reprint. She cried when she opened it.",best gifts for mom
49525,There might be a different in response times. Gaming monitors usually have a 1ms response time where as a general monitor will have around a 5ms response time or sometimes even more than 5ms. This means that there will be a shorter time between when you left click and when you see the gun fire in a game on a gaming monitor than on a regular monitor however in reality it is hard to tell the difference. To do this and still keep the price down gaming monitors will often use a TN lcd panel which won't have as good color reproduction and contrast as a IPS lcd monitor which often have higher response times than TN panels. However if you want the best of both worlds you can still find IPS monitors with low response times but they cost more usually.,best gaming monitor

38217,"I think it's entirely possible to be accurate and biased.  A large part of political posturing is telling most of the facts in a way that makes your argument look good.  

A large contingent of voters in my very-liberal state turned on Public Option Healthcare when a running Republican accurately campaigned (and possibly blew out of proportion) that public healthcare could ""force a Christian doctor to provide abortions""... which is technically true for First Amendment reasons if that doctor worked at a public facility and an abortion was warranted for the situation.

You could say that was entirely accurate, but also rather biased the way it was portrayed.

I think unbiased low-accuracy information might be at least as reliable as biased high-accuracy information.",best newspapers to read

34875,"That write up for Dalvin Cook is so sexy….good job u/Tripudelops.

Now that Dalvin has been ranked, I’ll say this for the final time:

The real travesty (I’ve said this in nearly every top 100 thread lol) is having only 1 TE and 2 RBs make an All Pro team, yet have 8 WRs with one of them being Cole Beasley. 

Waller should’ve made it with Kelce, and Cook should’ve made it with Henry and Kamara. 

Dalvin Cook was snubbed from an All Pro team after a 1900+ yard and 17 TD season, which is an accolade that greatly affects a player’s place in this game’s history, and all because the roster construction and voting system for All Pro teams are obviously flawed. I’m trying to get over it…..but it’s difficult.",best NFL player

In the same vein, I also really enjoy Danny Gonzalez’s commentary videos as well as his DIY stuff that he did like imitating the bad ads on Facebook and Instagram as well as trying out crafts from 5 minute crafts and Troom Troom.",best YouTube video
