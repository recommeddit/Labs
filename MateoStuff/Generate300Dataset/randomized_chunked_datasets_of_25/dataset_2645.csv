36036,"Half of the following is medically sound, half of it is my personal experience: 

Personal Experience:
 Its mostly the mixing of alcohol with a variety of other substances that tend to throw you're body for a loop. Energy drinks and alcohol (especially the cheap energy drinks) will really make you feel awful the next morning. That being said if you are into pre-workout stuff I wouldn't suggest taking it on a night you're going to go heavy on the alcohol. Your best bet to avoid the lazy feeling the next day is to drink only one kind of alcohol with the same light (or no) mix. Also stay awake for an hour or so after your last drink. No idea why this works so well for me but it seems to make a big difference not to have my last drink and go strait to bed. 

Medically Sound : 
Dont eat a big meal before drinking. If you drink on a relatively empty stomach you will get intoxicated much quicker and therefor require less alcohol to get you to whatever level on intoxication you want to be at. And of course less alcohol = less hungover. Eat at the end of the night (paramedics have told me peanut butter and banana sandwich is the best) and take a damn vitamin B.",best alcoholic drink
