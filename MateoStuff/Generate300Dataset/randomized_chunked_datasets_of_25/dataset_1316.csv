61836,Best RPG game on PS4,"""Ending"" A isn't actually an ending, it's more like completing chapter 1 of 3. Basically mislabelled because the game should be called finished when you make the choice between ""ending"" C or D, which actually results in a conclusion. And loading your save to get the other one results in ""ending"" E which is just the psychobabble that people circlejerk over."

15901,best sunglasses for fashion,Yeah that's like saying there's no difference between old navy and banana republic clothing.
61803,Best RPG game on PS4,"That it's not that much of a WRPG does not mean it's barely an RPG. It's absolutely and without any doubt an RPG. Much more so than HZD or Bloodborne, in my opinion.

Is it the definitive RPG as the other guy said? To that, I'd say no."
