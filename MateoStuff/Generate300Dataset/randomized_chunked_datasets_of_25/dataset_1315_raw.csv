It should be #2 or #1 on that list if anything.
Nope and apparently it's quite debatable.  But I know for me some things make me more noticeably more congested and dairy is one of them.
"As a SAHM that used to work, I find that I don't spend money on clothes for myself much anymore. I'm at home so why bother? Maybe treat her to some good date/going out clothes."
"Why? 
Because you saw the bitcoin and dogecoin taking off?"
"if you are just starting and doing practice sketching to study shapes and forms or anatomy, usually a fine surfaced sketchbook or a medium surface sketchbook will do. If you browse through the books at an art store the cover will usually tell you what kind of paper it is and what types of pencils work best. Also Strathmore sketchbooks are usually decently priced and put all the info you should need on the cover about what kind of drawings the paper is for. They have several different series of varying qualities. Personally I used the 400 series for random stuff http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81LHjC9SW%2BL._SL1200_.jpg

I use a black spiraled sketchbook for school aimed work or finished drawings. You can spend big bucks on those, or find them occasionally at dollar stores with decent quality paper. They're great to start out with if you want a cover you can personalize or think it looks more professional, also the covers don't rip off like sketchpads tend to. They are more like a ""book"" http://images.utrechtart.com/products/optionLarge/Strathmore/strathmore_fieldDrawing.jpg

for pencils just pick up a set from H4 to B8, which are relatively easy to find. You can also usually find them at the dollar store, but the ones from the art store tend to break less and sharpen easier. Also be sure to get a rubber eraser as well as a kneaded eraser so you can mold it and not smear your other lines (it's kind of like play doh) http://www.watercolorpainting.com/drawing/materials/erasers400294.jpg"

"Food scale! Great for food prep and making sure you hit your nutrition goals. 

I used to use measuring spoons/cups to figure things out but it's not as accurate as measuring weight. Also I'd end up with extra utensils to wash with all the measuring."

"Sherwin Williams’ Emerald in Snowbound. This particular white has a minute touch of blue, which works well against the yellow tint of my floors. Looks cleaner, too. I disagree with anyone who says “white paint is white paint”. Paint without pigment is bland."

"Carbon does not remove dissolved solids such as calcium and magnesium. It does effectively remove many dissolved organic compounds. Most toxins are removed excepts for nitrates and phosphates.

In the real world, I would say that carbon makes water safe at least 90% of the time. Carbon is much more effective than mechanical filtration.

It would take a book to really explain things."
Huh that's nice i didn't know that and no I'm not mixing them up ^^. I just took a look at vs Code and it seems pretty cool but atom just looks better (visually) in my opinion. What makes it so much better than atom tho?
