It only turned out that way because I liked that specific frame colour and grey lenses was what it came with :p I think it's meant for sunnier conditions so it's too dark if I wear them in the evening or when it's rainy.

Native fetch in the browser behaves the same way, it's not something specific to  the `node-fetch` library, so when you say ""it"" you're actually referring to the standard created by the browser vendors (a.k.a. WHATWG).

While it's not ergonomic in this particular case, it's done for a good technical reason, and is one of the very few caveats you have to remember (just like the fact that 4xx/5xx responses don't reject the initial promise). But in opposition to the article, I would just recommend using Axios if you want these things smoothed over for you.

`fetch` is intentionally barebones - it's first and foremost a replacement for `XMLHttpRequest`. While there's definitely an improvement in ease-of-use compared to XHR, that's not its primary concern - the intention is that wrapper libraries (like Axios) fulfill that role.

35036,"Well, if Lemieux didn't have the serious injury problems and the supporting casts Gretzky had in his prime he could have challenged these records. 

There is also more to the game than sheer offensive production. Howe scored more goals era adjusted and was a significantly more well rounded player. Orr is the only defenseman to ever lead the league in scoring (and he almost certainly would have done it more if not for injury problems). 

I think Gretzky's the greatest. But I at least think you can think otherwise and make a reasonable argument for it. 

Is there really a reasonable argument for any wide receiver being better than Rice?",best NFL player

14785,"I really enjoy novels written by Devney Perry, Melanie Harlow, Vi Keeland, or RS Grey.  I find them to all be really solid writers and it’s not often that I read one of their novels and get distracted by crappy dialogue, unbelievable plot, errors, etc.  I really can’t pick a particular novel by any of them because I think they’re all great!  They also publish pretty frequently; Perry and Harlow write novels in series mainly.

If I had to pick one novel that was really well written it would be Beach Read by Emily Henry.",best romantic novel

She’s experienced an immense amount of pain and bullying throughout her life, and while I don’t think the other Kardashian girls haven’t had difficulties throughout their lives, I think Khloe is the *most* relatable to the average human being. I know that doesn’t automatically make her upstanding and ethical but I think she can empathize more with and might try to understand and treat others with dignity and respect maybe a tad better than the others.",best Kardashian
