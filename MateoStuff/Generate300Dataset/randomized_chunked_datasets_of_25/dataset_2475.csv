31867,best hotel to live in,"Cabana Bay was our first on-site hotel. The room was really nice (tower room) and didnâ€™t hear anybody staying next to us. We had a parking lot view, but it was still a pretty view at night looking out at Orlando. 

We liked it so much, we are planning on staying there again in November unless we decide to splurge and get one that offers express passes."
2951,best webcamera,"> the people who really want great quality will buy a dedicated webcam

Yeah, this entire thread is about how desktop webcams still suck. Laptop webcams suck more, but being better than crappy doesn't make it good."

17663,best iOS game,I gave it another try. It really does seem grindy but I like the artstyle and theme. The only issue I have is that I have to be online and constantly focusing on the game to get credits. Does that change a bit later in the game?
3081,best webcamera,"> I simply don't understand why this market didn't evolved that much considering the fact that streaming is extremely popular and people are very interested in good quality webcams.

Because even before covid, most people don't buy webcams so there's no demand to really improve it. 

The market for streamers and content creators are niche. Those that are looking into this are likely going to use a point and shoot camera or DSLR as webcams or purchasing higher end webcams (they do exist but at a cost). On laptops, it's the same reason. No demand to increase quality. Most business people don't even care about the quality."
33272,best electric car,"Yeah, if trying to stay around 35-40k, I think the ID.4 might be your current best bet (other than waiting).

""A 2021 Volkswagen ID. 4 can pull a braked trailer weighing up to 2,200 pounds and unbraked loads of up to 1,650 pounds.""

Apparently pretty well received, but no frunk if that matters, no real one pedal driving if that matters, have heard they're not as ""fun"" as some other options but maybe doesn't matter, etc.  You'd have to research based on what you prefer and maybe just test one."

53516,best medicine for a cold,"I also have an autoimmune disorder and my endocrinologist who deals with it knows vommitting is particularly bad for me, so she listed codiene as an allergy for me even though its a side effect because the vommitting if severe enough as a type 1 diabetic could cause hospitalization, coma etc. If it turns too dka . just an idea ."

Sorry I got bored at some point. Might finish this later. Is it actually even that useful without youtube links on all of them (I'm sure they are on youtube just couldn't be bothered).

Plus by the look of it people have created spotify links so all my work looks pretty silly right about now.

EDIT: Will try and add more youtube links tomorrow, too tired right now. I would just like to point out I don't agree with all the choices on here, or even that it's a good set of songs, I'm just listing them. If nothing else a lot of these songs seem to appeal to very different musical tastes."
