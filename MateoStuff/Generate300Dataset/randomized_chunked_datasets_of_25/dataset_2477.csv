27469,best bollywood actor,"He's had his fair share of movies where he romances girls 20+ years younger than him, he was more or less forced to transition."

54451,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I want a medium size Hayate Otsu. The only thing stopping me from pulling the trigger is the xsoft versus soft. What is the real difference between the two?

To be clear, I don't even use a mouspad right now. I play on the wood surface of my desk. I also use 4400 dpi and don't want to make large movements with my hand, if that helps."

10475,best suitcase lock,"That's exactly it.  It's to keep away lazy thieves.  It's the same principle with car locks, door and window locks on your home, and security software on your phone and computer.  The thief who knows what they're doing will have absolutely zero issue with those deterrents but a less than ambitious one will probably say fuck it and move on to the next one."
