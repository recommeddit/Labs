"I have a list on my movie blog for my top 20 documentaries on Netflix, check it out and let me know what you think. Http://moviesandnate.com, there are two Werner Herzog choices on there"
"I was doing volunteer work at a con some years back, working with the photo studio where people got their photos with the celebrities. This random guy was in studio B getting a photo with a couple of the original power rangers, while Nathan was doing his shoots in studio A right next door. 

Right at the moment this guy is getting his power rangers photo, Nathan runs across into studio B and jumps in behind them effectively photo bombing this guys photo, so it's the guy, the power rangers and Nathan fillion half flying through the air with a ridiculous look on his face. I was doing the prints afterwards and the dude was just ecstatic, kept asking if he was allowed to keep as technically he didn't pay for a photo with Nathan. Studio photographers were like ""It was his choice to do it, so all yours."" guarantee that dude had that photo framed.

I was lucky enough to get a photo with him also, nice guy, very friendly."

"> Don't brush too hard, use soft bristles, and make little tiny circles around each tooth.

I've been told to angle my brush towards where the tooth meets the gum and then brush toward the center."

"I also went with Jansports in middle school and high school (about 10-12 years ago) and the first one was great for a long time but then it was stolen.  

Going on my good experience and the company's good reputation I bought another one.  It broke in less than a year.  ""It must have been a fluke,"" I thought.  My first bag was so good.  I had two more flukes after that until I finally realized that my first good experience must have been the fluke.  

Their main problem was the zippers getting caught on unraveled threads.  

tl;dr- Had four Jansports 10-12 years ago.  First one was great until it was stolen.  The rest were lemons."
"What if you had 3 suit cases inside of each other, but each had glitter filling the extra empty spaces? Then lastly you can have a dickbutt taped to a rock in the inner most case. 

Make sure that the outside case looks really expensive. You know that after they scan in the curiosity will indulge then to open it. In fact I would go one step further and write on the outside stating that there is only glitter and a rock inside in bold letters."

"If you like Sand & Sable try Jennifer Aniston edp (formerly known as Lolavie). It has a tropical pikake  jasmine vibe. Kind of reminds me of Johnson's baby shampoo but the 80's formula.

I do love cheapies for when I want something light, simple and pleasant because I am not looking to wear something complex every single day. I tend to prefer higher end designer or niche when looking for complexity though. Gotta love some of those drugstore classics too.

Skin Musk by Bonne Belle (unless Coty or some company took over) simple baby oil smell. I love that.

Coty Wild Musk almost the same as Skin Musk but even lighter. Great if you want something light but barely there light. 

Jovan Amber Musk great amber but not very lasting at all.

Jovan White Musk

Jovan Musk a light citrus neroli musk.

Alfred Sung Shi tranquil water floral with steamed rice note.

Alfred Sung Jewel light and juicy featuring frangipani and coconut.

Eau De Dali by Salvador Dali powdery green floral with light citrus notes.

Salvador Dali Purple Light is a cute, green lilac.

Elizabeth Taylor Violet Eyes peony, rose, peach with an impressive cedar note. I am not usually a fan of cedar-y frags either.

Vanilla Fields

Vanilla Musk

Terranova China Rain oil

Pacifica French Lilac as others mentioned.

Kuumba Made oils are mostly good.

My favorite out of all these would have to be the Sand & Sable you mentioned with Jennifer Aniston edp coming in at a close second."

"Dude, eat what you want, makes you happy, makes you physically feel good. 

My recent daily routine is make a pot of coffee, cook breakfast sausage and scramble three eggs. 

People are amazed when I fill them in in the fact that this is part of what has helped my drop 30-35 pounds this year."
"there's a chemical process going on in your mouth at all times that replenishes the enamel on your teeth. this process normally binds calcium as part of the enamel. Fluoride can take calcium's place in this process, resulting in a more resistant enamel. Thus ensuring that your mouth is a fluoride-rich (in relative terms...) environment will result in stronger and healthier teeth.

Letting this process run its course uninterrupted is also one reason why you shouldn't snack between meals.

"I personally bought the PG279Q from Asus and I love it. GSync, 165 Hz, and it's 1440p. Linus actually has a video on it and I pretty much bought it off his recommendation."
