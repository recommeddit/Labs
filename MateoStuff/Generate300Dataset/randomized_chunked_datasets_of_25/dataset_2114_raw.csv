"I disagree - Chicago might be the only city in the Mid-West with enough public transportation to get pretty much anywhere you need to without a car.

Parking for an hour in Chi-town is also horrible.  Parking at your hotel overnight in Chicago is also horrible.

Food for thought - if you have kids consider a car for convenience, but a young couple might get away with no car in Chicago."
"Your right, it has been a moon or two.  The good the bad and the ugly would be a good choice."
"I'd second this list, also add *Foreign Policy* to the list, as well as one or two foreign publications to your list, depending upon your interests and background. Which ones you want in particular is...up to you, and depends on your interests, other geographic regions of interest, etc."
"The game got bad publicity because of the costant delays, their failure to keep up to date with the release date and the lock at 30fps

It's good game with a lot of promises, I prefer off road racing though like WRC games and Motorstorm games, but Driveclub is awesome too if you want graphics like Need for Speed The Run"
Thanks a lot.
You could make a religion out of it.
The usual suspects. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
Has anyone tried magglass tempered glass matte screen protector. Wonder if this would be best of both.

"They have good coverage. However, if you dont have either the ""Play more"", ""Do more"", or ""Get More"" unlimited plan, they will put your device under whats called network management. What it actually is that you are be deprioritized and throttled throughout the day. So if you are having issues with data, make sure you aren't on the ""Start Unlimited"" plan. 

Also, if you have wi-fi in your home, make sure that wi-fi calling is turned on. It' s a free feature from VZW"
"[Hodgkin and Huxley's classic 1952 papers describing the action potential.](http://www.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/HistoryofNeuroscience/hodgkin5.pdf)

To think that, completely ignorant of the membrane proteins involved, they were able to develop a quantitative model that *accurately corresponds to ion channel subunits discovered decades later* is just fucking beautiful."
licorice ice cream ? Where has this been all of my life ?

"I have never eaten a pecan nut. Hope it is yummy.

Nuts sound a good bet generally. Will check pecans out."
Oblivion IRL.
But bring your own water.
"When i was in Ireland i stayed in this place called the Killarney Guest House. Super cute place. They were situated like houses but had an area where you could eat breakfast.. you also had your own private room, with a private bathroom. The breakfast was so good, a full breakfast, and the people that ran it were super nice. Our beds were always made, the rooms were clean.

The location was great too. Right across from Cork college and about a mile walk from the town where there were tons of bars and shopping.

It was a nice place to stay that wasnt exactly a “hotel” type place

Only downfall was no elevators and we had to climb three flights of stairs with our luggage"

"Right choice. I love it, buying as early as I put some money behind. It’s so dry and warm, but kinda aetheric and cold at the same time. Like a desert at sunset, when it gets cold, but the sand has still the heat of the day conserved"
"Disappointed I had to scroll all the way to the end of the thread to see The Fugees - The Score, but at least someone said it. Good job. I would also like to add The Roots - Things Fall Apart, absolute classic, a front to back listen."
