64485,Best Nike running shoes,"Awesome job on this - answered many questions I had about Nike's lineup.    

I've never run in the Flyknit shoes, I wonder if they allow stretch/splay like the stretch fabric that Newton/NB uses on some of their shoes, that LunarRacer looks really appealing for the cushion/weight ratio."

Honestly, I'm sure I won't ever complete it in one go. There are just so many other things I would do if I quit my job.

15072,best romantic novel,"I mean, I've talked to quite a few women who were involved and there was without a doubt a tonne of underground slash fiction trading. At that point there really weren't that many male Trekkies in comparison and not many, if any, were involved like they were. I'm also going to point out that dude, it was underground. They were hiding it. If you weren't on the mailing list you weren't going to find out about it because a lot of it wasnt legal to share around."
