61922,Best RPG game on PS4,"1) Witcher 3

2) Dragon Age Inquisition

3) Fallout 4

4) HZD

5) Nier Automata

The last 2 are questionable to be called RPG's, but frankly I loved all 5 of them. Never got around to finishing Bloodborne, but it was fantastic from what I played.

I will say that the Witcher 3 is so far above and beyond any other RPG, or really game, that i've played, and they are my favourite genre."
73338,best Linux distro,"TLDR: Mint

Your support window request is too high. Mint releases are supported for 4-5 years from initial release but as you are going to come around part way through the cycle you are going to need to upgrade sooner for example within 3.5 years at the moment but fortunately this is extremely painless via the update GUI and you will probably want to do this sooner. You could easily do nothing but use its update gui for the next decade if the machine doesn't die first. Mint exclusively tracks Ubuntu LTS releases usually a few months after a new LTS release comes out and is extremely stable.

Debian is going to be out of date than Mint or Ubuntu eventually you will want something that you can't have easily on Debian stable. This is a better choice for a server than your desktop in my opinion.

The difference between Ubuntu and Mint is that Ubuntu often to my thinking makes ""interesting"" sub optimal decisions for example Unity Snap etc etc etc that represent technical explorations not focused on maximal usability while Mint remains strongly focused on making Ubuntu more usable. See Cinnamon vs Gnome."

63801,best books for building better habits reddit,"We are a species confined by the models we make of the world. This is a simplified introduction to Willpower and the Willpower as a muscle is just a model, but it seems to be the model that most people behave according to. 

But the fascinating research are the outliers. The people and examples where Willpower seems to be infinite. POJs, Endurance athletes, David Blaine (lol). 

Do you have any book recommendations that explore Willpower as an infinite resource?"

5039,best home improvement store,"is that what happened? I have indeed noticed low morale there.

Also the in-store music has lots of minor-key songs for some reason."
16711,best pet for toddlers,Do not get a shelter dog if you’re not dog experienced and have little time. Having young children is so consuming you won’t have time for a project dog. Get a cat as a maximal level of commitment. Smaller pets like guinea pigs and hamster still need time and money. Maybe fish or hermit crab for now if you guys are not so much of animal people
15604,best tree for the garden,"If you want wood I'd go with hybrid poplars. Check out the Boardman tree farm. It is beautiful. The trees grow straight, get to full size in a matter of years, people are always looking for good wood. 

Apples are always good if you want fruit. That is a lot more work though."
57840,best cologne,"I picked up some Rogue Man a while back too. Strange thing it smells like a mix between a ""dirty vanilla"" with a dash of La Nuit De L'Homme in it. Smells good and very reasonable price, but it does suffer the ""celeb"" flaw in that the longevity could be better."
