2) Dragon Age Inquisition

3) Fallout 4

4) HZD

5) Nier Automata

The last 2 are questionable to be called RPG's, but frankly I loved all 5 of them. Never got around to finishing Bloodborne, but it was fantastic from what I played.

I will say that the Witcher 3 is so far above and beyond any other RPG, or really game, that i've played, and they are my favourite genre.",Best RPG game on PS4
73338,"TLDR: Mint

Your support window request is too high. Mint releases are supported for 4-5 years from initial release but as you are going to come around part way through the cycle you are going to need to upgrade sooner for example within 3.5 years at the moment but fortunately this is extremely painless via the update GUI and you will probably want to do this sooner. You could easily do nothing but use its update gui for the next decade if the machine doesn't die first. Mint exclusively tracks Ubuntu LTS releases usually a few months after a new LTS release comes out and is extremely stable.

Debian is going to be out of date than Mint or Ubuntu eventually you will want something that you can't have easily on Debian stable. This is a better choice for a server than your desktop in my opinion.

The difference between Ubuntu and Mint is that Ubuntu often to my thinking makes ""interesting"" sub optimal decisions for example Unity Snap etc etc etc that represent technical explorations not focused on maximal usability while Mint remains strongly focused on making Ubuntu more usable. See Cinnamon vs Gnome.",best Linux distro
