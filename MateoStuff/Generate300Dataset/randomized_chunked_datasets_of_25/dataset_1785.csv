26039,best politician,"I do think Bernie has been mostly consistent throughout his career with his beliefs and voting record, and he doesn't seem to be a shill or just in it for his donors, he truly fights for what he believes in. Although as a left leaning liberal I don't think he's the best representative for us."

17806,best Kardashian,"This interesting because I think it depends on the category. When it comes to communicating with staff, servers, workers etc I’d say Khloe is the best, the worst is Kourtney or Kendall. When it comes to standing up for women or spewing misogyny, Khloe and Rob are the worst. Kim is generally better about social issues but that’s only because the rest of them are beyond trash. Kourtney is just best at staying out the way which is a morality in some kind of way. Truly, they are all horrible people tho so I can’t even rank it."
19322,best YouTube video,"I was going to mention FOTC! My favorite episode though is when Jemaine starts dating an Australian. 

“My mum says I talk like Marilyn Monroe now.”

68735,best science fiction novel,The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.
71083,best movies with a cool twist,"I agree. Movie’s like fight club, arrival, se7en, the sixth sense, shutter island, the prestige, memento, predestination and identity are far better movies, more interesting, and much butter twists. The usual suspects kind of reminds me of Now You See Me because both have twists that seem good at first, then you realize they make no sense."
