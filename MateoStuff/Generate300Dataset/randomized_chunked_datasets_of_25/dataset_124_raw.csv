+1 on this!  Interviewing potential software engineering interns. So many were not interested in their software engineering field! “Stop wasting your time and money!”

Tahiti is a magical place
"Memphis: BBQ and tap water (but of a local joke, but still). My favorite BBQ is Exit 87 BBQ at Exit 87 on I-40.

Nashville: 2nd Avenue. Honky Tonk bars abound, and there's more than just that (symphony, Opry, etc.).

East: Knoxville is beautiful, but the main draw is GSMNP, which is the most visited national park, period. If you want to see a mountain town without so much traffic, go to Townsend. It's a slightly more chill Gatlinburg.

Go Titans, Go Vols, Go Preds!"

I figured that's what you meant after I posted that.
"Yeah, wide color gamut thing doesn't even have any real advantage, infact it just makes colours look a bit more saturated which you may not like.

Also there is a newer model GN850 launched which may be available anytime soon. It is also cheaper with improved design.

"Worked in five star hotels in Beverly Hills.. boy do I have stories:

- Sheikh picks up a hooker in the bar, takes her to his room. She roofies him and steals tens of thousands of dollars of cash, watches and valuables
- Husbands who will say hello to staff with their mistress on their arm on Thursday night and their wife on Friday night
- Famous teen celebrity left a room full of needles and various drug paraphernalia behind for housekeeping to clean up
- Middle eastern royalty ships in multiple Ferraris and Lamborghinis to the hotel from their home country to drive for the week; caught drag racing later that night by the cops in the neighborhoods of Beverly Hills
- Largest checkout bill I’ve ever seen was roughly $2 million for guest who rented out an entire floor of suites for three weeks, promptly paid via wire transfer
- Had to procure $100k cash for a guest whose wife wanted to shop on Rodeo Drive the next morning, the local bank doesn’t even have that much. Had to get an armored car from the central LA bank branch to deliver

The list goes on.."
"Haven't heard of that one before, is it a limited run they're making or something?"
"Actually, I did not. :P Thank you for the information though! I am glad a manual option is there, I guess the other part of me staying old school is the fact I don't deal with a monthly fee. Maybe when I get my debt paid down I can roll over to the new YNAB."

Write as much as you want mate ;)

"The book was really good, as is most of Dennis Lehane's work."
I'll take a look.  That sounds like a life-saver for me.
lel hows that Eb
"This.  We definitely were only permitted to use 4-function calculators in school for calculus, can't remember if that was a rule for Algebra and trig as well, but it might have been.  My experience with calculators that actually could perform calculus problems didn't provide enough, if any at all, of the line by line solutions that you'll need to show be able to show your work.  

There's plenty of info online, and I'm pretty sure that I've even seen some apps that will allow you to just take a picture of the problem, and it'll spit out the solution. That would have been a game changer for me looking back on my experience touring calculus.  

If I had any advice about learning calculus tho, it would be to learn and memorize the Unit Circle.  Unit Circle is life."
Oldboy. Twisted shit right thur.
"Persona 5, and I don't even like JRPG's that much. It's such a fun game - likable characters, interesting story and is stylish as hell with some cool visuals and amazing soundtrack."
Luigi board?
Is cancellation possible?
In my experience Verizon is the best but it really differs from area to area. A lot of people say ATT is great but it's been really bad in my area.
