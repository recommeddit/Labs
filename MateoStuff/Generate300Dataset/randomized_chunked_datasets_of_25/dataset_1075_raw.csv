"This is more for windows machines, but I've found that Microsoft applications do a good job with pen/annotation.

Powerpoint is one example, but like you said it doesn't work for pdfs.

For PDFs, I use the microsoft edge browser.  You open the pdf inside edge, you'll get a menu across the top that allows you to choose color and thickness of lines."
"Is Skyrim really one of the best RPGs? I am currently thinking about it, I loved Oblivion but I have also heard skyrim is kinda meh.."
Oh thanks for letting me know. Let me correct that. :)
Are we really all sleeping on Witcher 3 right now? Its not anywhere in the top 10 comments
"The Princes Tale. It's where ""Always"" comes from. And while the cringe Harry Potter community made it a joke from redundancy, it's still one of the most powerful parts of the story and why Snape is admired by many including me."
"Things suddenly started going so well something had to be up.  The specific twist was a surprise but it wasn't a shocker things were not what they seemed.

I've noticed this a lot recently.  Writers and directors will hit a certain beat once too many and then I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Too many lingering shots of a happy couple means one of them is not long for this world.  Someone pulls out their daughters picture a bit too often and there's a car bomb 3 scenes later"

"As a thief, I would expect a suitcase like this to have contents of significantly higher value. I would feel more intrigued to take the suitcase or something."
"Well, you have to buy the Special Edition to get B1 but yeah. 

Have you played God Hand? I fucking loved that game too! It's on PSN although I've no idea how much it costs, I bought it the day it was put on there after having a not so legit copy on my PS2."
"I'm curious what speeds are you getting with mullvad from a heavily seeded torrent? I'm currently using surfshark and I'm getting my full speeds (250 down 25 up are my advertised speeds).
I was looking at signing up for mullvad once my subscription expires since surfshark doesn't support portforwarding.
But if mullvad doesn't give me all or a big chunk of my current speed it might not be worth switching."
Granted. 2 guys are coming over to your house tonight. Merry Christmas.
Goddammit I just bought a KW mobile one a few days ago :( arrives in a few weeks

"Other than maybe Paul Wellstone, he is probably my favorite politician in my lifetime."
Amen!
"I just ordered the Shumuri Slim Extra for my 6, haven't received it yet. But excited. My go-to case right now is the Incipio NGP. Provides the perfect amount of protection, grip, and covers all sides. I love my Apple Silicone case too just hate that it doesn't protect the bottom of the phone. If it wrapped the whole phone that would be the only case I use."
Armani Mania.
"Make ahead frozen burritos! 

Just buy tortillas, eggs, and whatever else you want to add in there. I like spinach, cheese, and peppers. Cook the eggs and sauté peppers and roll it up on a tortilla. Wrap them up and freeze them. Reheat in the morning for about 1:30 in the microwave."
