"Yes, Jo Beverly‚Äôs medieval romances were wonderful too. üòç I have read far too many of her books. I always care about her characters and she usually has a well crafted story that supports the romance. I rarely got bored reading her!

"I guess ""discontinued"" is a repeating theme in this post, but I'm babying the last bit of my Coty *Raw Vanilla*, after clumsily spilling like half the bottle on the floor.

Same for my St Charles Shave Co one-off *Santalum Album*, and *Sandalwood From Wood*. Discontinued, and of course I stupidly dropped one of my bottles of Sandalwood From Wood to shatter on the floor. The one-off Santalum Album is something I treasure, but at least I haven't spilled it yet.

Lalique *Encre Noir* smells nice and is pretty cheap.

Edit: Stirling Soap now makes an EdT of one of my favorite vetiver ""blending"" scents, *Port au Prince!* It's vetiver and lemongrass, great for brightening up Encre Noir or deepening Terre de Hermes. I've long loved the aftershave, but now there's perfume juice! Next paycheck, Port au Prince, you are mine!
