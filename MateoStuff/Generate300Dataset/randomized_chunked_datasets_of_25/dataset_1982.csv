57173,best water brand,"I’m honestly not sure how much water hardness alters pH level. I believe water hardness is usually an indicator of how many minerals, metals, etc. remain the water by the time it reaches your home. Like you, around here it’s super regional and varies from town to town. Not sure if harder waters taste differently (I’d assume they do, just like mineral waters), but at least from my experience people tend to talk about water hardness as a consequence of owning a home/renting a place where you live, since it can calcify faucets and shower heads and whatnot."
