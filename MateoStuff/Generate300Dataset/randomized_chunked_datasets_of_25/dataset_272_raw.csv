**EDIT:** as others have mentioned the Warranty is worth it alone.

"" Our unconditional lifetime guarantee is simple. If our socks are not the most comfortable, durable and best fitting socks you have ever owned, return them for another pair. No strings. No conditions. Socks guaranteed for life. ""
