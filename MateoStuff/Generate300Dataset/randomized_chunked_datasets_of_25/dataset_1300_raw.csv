"Nope, I'm from Atlanta. Growing up in the South, I've had some of the best BBQ in the country from the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama.

I visited NYC to check out Columbia (because I may go to grad school there) and I went to Dinosaur in Harlem and it rivaled some of the places down here in the South."
"Don Hutson dominated to a far greater degree, sometimes having more receptions/TDs than entire teams, and often more than the next 3 top receivers, AND he played defensive back, average 5 interceptions a season, which were 11-12 games."
What happens with the icemaker?
serious question- Why do germans dig holes in the beach? Do they have such a strong work ethic that they have to do something while relaxing at the beach?
"My dad is a Blackhawk pilot, and during one of his Iraq tours, Chuck Norris came through the country on a USO tour, and my dad was lucky enough to get to fly him around while he was there.  He said Chuck was a really genuine guy with a great sense of humor.

EDIT: found a picture, not very good quality though :( http://imgur.com/IXFdS  The other guy in the picture is Marshal Teague."
"Just to be clear, you're talking Football-soccer, not American football, right? If you're interested in Football-soccer, try to catch a Sounders home match in Seattle. HUGE fan community there, and matches are a great time. In the Seattle area, there's also clubs, museums, shopping, and lots of hiking and outdoor activities. If you go in the summer, specifically late July through August, the weather tends to be absolutely wonderful - Highs in the mid seventies with relatively low humidity and sun. Great scenery."
"What would folks suggest for a 2 line plan that features fairly heavy data usage, minor international travel, and a fairly flexible budget? My wife and I are considering moving to our own plan off the family plan due to the limitations the family plan puts us on.

Possible considerations for a mobile hotspot also in times of need."
"Not me but my uncle used to be a professional body guard. He said by far, Tom Hanks was the kindest and the worst was Azelia Banks.


Here’s a video of her on Wild ‘N Out. Shows her true colors: https://youtu.be/ZVx8WS8ndgU"
"The majority of these remind me right away of Sheldon Cooper, Oy, I need to get out more..."
"There are a bunch of sites out there devoted just to pencils if you take the time to look.  [PencilTalk.Org](http://www.penciltalk.org/) is one, for example.

There are lots more!  :)

"It also had, like, twice as many movies going for it"
Verizon's only low band there is band 13 which is 4G. So you'd need to turn off 5G
"Ah, I thought you were talking about a larger pie version, which sounds good too."
"I saw her randomly at whole foods in Hollywood, I immediately  recognized her and began to do an awkward peeping around the aisles and staring dance. Finally I squared my shoulders, walked over and said ""Paris? Can I take a picture with you?"" that's when I see she's on the phone and am about to walk away when she puts the person on hold says ""sure sweetie"" and takes a couple shots with me. Whenever I tell this story, people always ask "" was she stupid?"" it gets me all angry because I feel like we're best buds now and I have to defend her."
"Some folks above seem to disagree with this, saying baking soda is abrasive to surface contaminants, but not enamel."
"I won't criticize someone for wanting to spend less. Because who wouldn't to really? I guess my point is for classic things like Ray Ban Wayfarers for example, for me at least, there's just a certain pride in having the real deal."
"With \- bacon, bacon, bacon. And some sausage."
ty will save this : ) also any suggestion for pdf extension ?
"Yeah they are outsourcing the OLED panels for that one, so way more expensive and lacking the features of LG OLED panels. The 42"" will be their own though. It's also a very efficient size to manufacture, so could be quite a bit cheaper than the 48"".

Still too big for my tastes, but if it's around $1,000 I don't know how long I'll be able to resist given the generally paralyzed state of monitors."
"Vodka soda, splash of cranberry, and at least two limes. Not fancy, but very delicious and on the lower calorie end of the ""girly"" drinks."
"The humanism in speaker for the dead came through a lot better for me than in Ender's game. A lot of the charm in Ender's game were the battle games and how ender outwits everyone else and the focus is not so much on the philosophical themes.

This makes the ending that much more shocking but also it means that the philosophy gets explored to a lesser degree. Those are the only two books I read in that series. The others seemed to have really mixed reviews."
"I can only imagine the pride on his face as he relishes in the “of course you did” look on your face. Sounds like a great guy and a better father, I hope he’s resting easy."

If you want to talk about disproportionate tandem fatality rates, Lodi has had one, Sky Dance has had 2-3 throughout the years and a couple other students on top of that.  And Lodi does more jumps overall per year.

&#x200B;

Any dropzone that has ever had a tandem death (quite a few) and does less jumps per year than Lodi (until 2 years ago, most did less per year) then those all have higher fatality rates.  And any DZ which has had more than one (like Sky Dance an hour away) is way higher.  Learn your facts before you sound like an idiot online."
