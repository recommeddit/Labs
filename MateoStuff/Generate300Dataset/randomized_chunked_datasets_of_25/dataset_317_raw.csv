Oh no I mean the weight on the Amazon listing is 0.023oz. I’d be curious if you got one to weigh it and let me know! I’m on the hunt for better options right now as well.

"My $.02 — You don’t drive very many miles per day.  If I were you I would get a 2015 Nissan Leaf or 2015 Volkswagen E-golf.   The leaf has better comforts such as a heated steering wheel (SL trim) and cell phone connectivity.  The E-Golf is a better driving vehicle and is made with seemingly higher quality materials.

I would also skip the level 2 charger at home for now.  Just charge level 1 off the standard outlet- your miles driven doesn’t warrant a need for level 2 installation.  You can always install in the future if overnight charging L1 isn’t working well enough for you."
