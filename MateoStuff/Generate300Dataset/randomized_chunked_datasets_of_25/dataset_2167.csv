47405,"You can rarely ski even in the big cold resorts in Utah and Colorado during the summer. I know some people ski on Mount Hood in OR but you're really going to have a better time skiing in the winter. 

I would come to Utah. SLC can be a little bit dry but few people visit to come to SLC (i'll get to this later but a lot of what many states have to offer lie outside of the cities). We have some of the most amazing scenery on earth:

you might want to modify your plans from just including cities (which you seem to have, i'm just a little shaky on what you plan to do but i can help you make plans), much of the western united states is filled with stuff like this that you'll only find hundreds of miles from cities. there is a ton to see in the cities but you might have more fun doing a road trip with more emphasis on what lies between the cities rather than just travelling to a bunch of cities. i know a ton of people who just come to NYC, LA, Miami and then they leave and they feel like they missed out on something. the US is incredibly big so you're never going to see it all but asking what **cities** are the best to visit might set you up for a bad vacation if you leave the rest out


also if you're coming for the cold, minneapolis is going to be 90 degrees and humid in the summer. and in the winter its not really an enjoyable cold, its just uncomfortable and unpleasant (like your face hurts and you don't want to be outside and there is ice stuck to your eyelashes). i don't know of many people visiting minneapolis for the cold, usually you see pasty white minnesotans fleeing to the tropics in the summer haha. you should consider adding alaska to your plans if you can. really anywhere in the US is going to be hot in the summer but the farther north you get in alaska and at very high elevations (12k+ feet) you might be able to find below freezing weather. it seems like you want to do a lot of stuff involving the cold so if you can, try to extend your travel plans in to december (what sort of timeframe are you looking at?)",best state to visit in the United States
26008,"I feel like the idea that politicians vote for the sake of corporate contributions is a little overblown. It could easily be the other way around: corporations donate to politicians who profess the belief that low corporate taxes and deregulation are good for the middle class. Many people do genuinely believe that.

I doubt it's all one or the other, but the idea that all GOP politicians vote FOR money seems too common on reddit.

5757,"You need   
1) HTML / CSS like you already know  
2) Javascript like you said  
3) Some back end language. Python is fine, PHP, c# for asp.net  
4) Basic SQL. You can use it with mysql, mssql, or another database.  

A lot of posts here are focusing too much on what specific language. Part of becoming a good programming is learning how to learn programming. You just need one of each type, then in the future as the need arises you can learn the ones you need to know for the job. It's also good to learn the strengths of each language so you know when to go ahead and learn a new one.  

I personally went the C# for asp.net MVC and use MS SQL for the most part, but i doubt the microsoft stack is popular here, and I wouldn't be against jumping to another stack for a different job.",best programming language for web development
