Also paging r/trees ;)
"Sour Patch Kids. And none of that watermelon shit, I mean the originals. The best."
Because it's shit. These developers are complete assholes. They tried to do two simulators before that but they weren't good enough so sim community didn't play them. Then they shifted to arcade and this time arcade community ignored them. They just don't have a clue on how to make racing games.
Just leave a bowl of candy outside. It'll be all gone by the fourth visitor
"I lived in Ventura form 2016 to this year, I grew up in Ojai. Beacon coffee is just a huge disappointment in every way, I've been to both spots. I'm not into poorly roasted and poorly prepared espresso served by a man bun. What can I say, I'm the worst coffee snob I know besides my bf. We suck."
I feel like that is going to ruin the point of a twist ending if you know there is a twist coming.
"+1 for libreoffice, also hate to be the local library shill, but library will have excel for free use, and often will help you find a job. I had to learn excel for a Analyst job, as I only used SQL Server and tools for that, and a job required excel ( two steps back, but hey if their paying..), just went to the library and r/excel and binged for 3 days, got the job. Excel macros will land you jobs for sure."
"Two pet ducks. You may be tempted to go for one. But trust me. You need two. And you’ll have about $76 left over.

Edit: Fully humbled by the awards, kind friends."
Thanks for all the comments so far guys. I sincerely appreciate everyones input! I am just signing off for the night since I need to be up for work in less than 6 hours. But I look forward to reading more comments in the morning! Thanks again!
Call of Duty Mobile has a battle Royale mode with it as well! It’s just a good FPS. Very FTP.

Find a classical teacher and take lessons. Learning by yourself would take longer.
Depends of if you're in public or not.

"Also remember to stay hydrated when taking most meds. Very much so with those who help loosen that phlegm. Like the one who advertises with the little green mucus man lol. Mainlynstay hydrated not with sodas, or sports drink. Try water, hot tea, lemon water. Oh and honey is great  for relieving a sore throat. Only if you are over age of 1. No babies. Cough drops tend to help but you take or suck on too many you may get diarrhea. And try a steamer to add comfort for stuffiness."
"Exactly. If a guy is really into shaving (I don't know why someone would be really into shaving, but to each his own) get him shaving stuff. If he really likes playing the guitar, get him guitar stuff. If he likes sci-fi, get him sci-fi schwag. If he likes knick-knacks and figures, get him knick-knacks and figurines.

Pretty much the best gift for anyone is something they like.

*Edit:* Based on the responses, guys really hate when you buy them things for their hobby. It turns out they really just want shaving shit.

^(I hope no one in my life reads this thread and just gets me shaving shit for the rest of my life.)"
where's the lamb saucceeeeeee
"To be fair, they aren't easy to make properly, let alone well."
If you keep the hard boiled eggs stored in a container with water you can peel the shell off in two pieces. Literally just crack the egg and it slides off.   Changed your life today.
"I think you’ve just inadvertently given me the reason why I don’t think I like sci fi as much as fantasy. 

I have trouble reading books that are older. Of the language is ever slightly dated I just find it hard to engage. Whenever I try to read many of the books on this list inevitably put them down. I have realised that I just don’t hear that much about newer books. I recently read Adrian Tchaikovsky’s children of time and I fucking loved it."
I guess leveling up = rpg nowadays? Not like you can role play in bloodborne so idk
"The elite don't want you to know that, but the ducks at the park are free, you can take them home. I have 458 ducks."
Nobody took a survey.
I'm a fan of the Ray-Ban 3386 modified aviators. They look great with everything in my opinion.
"Raising Hope - You have to pay very close attention to this show.  A lot of the zingers come completely out of nowhere, are delivered in a deadpan tone of voice, and are never acknowledged by any other character."
