Hahaha that would be annoying. But the ads only come between songs so that'd be like waiting til the end of the song before lifting which is equally anticlimactic
I've never heard good recommendations for guinea pigs.
They're not a big part but Dragonforce definitely has a few songs in my 'kickass' playlist.
"**Pros:** 

Field work/being outside all the time

Becoming a rock-pun-master

Drinking a lot of beer

Crazy professors

**Cons:** 

Sometimes you drink too much beer.

Ha just kidding, there are no cons."
"England has a 25 man squad while France has a 23 man one, could explain why England is at the top. Besides a lot of highly valued players of french team (cf. pogba and Mbapp√©) are in the last year of their contract, lowering their market value"
"I drive a Model 3 Performance. I see a lot of people in this thread saying EVs will be great for commuting, and that's true - however I hope all of these people try a Performance 3 because it is astonishing. It's a fighter jet for the street. The acceleration is insane, it actually rotates in the corners, and track mode is brilliant at using the cars' dual motors and regenerative braking to torque vector and throw weight around in ways that improve handling. Autopilot and no gas is just a bonus. 

I'm not saying EVs are the future of Performance, because I believe gas cars will eventually be the new vinyl records. We collect them, we play with them on Sunday mornings and we appreciate them for their Fidelity. But EVs are quickly becoming part of the Performance conversation. The Model 3 is the first EV that can thrash all day at the track and not overheat - an important step for EVs. 

As charge times continue to improve and costs come down, it's going to be really hard for enthusiasts to ignore the benefits of an EV as a vehicle that can do it all - commute economically and also put up blistering times at the track.

I expect the Taycan and electric Cayman will go a long way to convincing folks in this sub. Those are due in 2020 and 2022 respectively."

"I have the lowest tier bidet from Costco and it is amazing! It‚Äôs just a cold line, but the water needs to run for a while until you get water that is actually cold enough to be uncomfortable."
"I play piano and French horn, I would definitely say the French horn is more difficult, but of course piano is no walk in the park to get good at either."
"I'm young. Can anyone fill me in on why he was assassinated? 

(I'll likely read up after work, but would appreciate a discussion here until then)"

I love it when a movie straight up hands you the old ‚Äúwatch closely. I‚Äôm going to trick you‚Äù and then it does and you feel good about it."
Get a trial for Hulu just to watch Rick and Morty :)
Illegal in my country + prefer trees more to help the planet.
"Great read!

Would recommend the Powersupport Air Jacket for thin cases. They have clear and matte versions. Best thin case imo. A must buy every year. 

For my 12pro's nomad rugged. The lip near the power button doesn't wrap onto the frame, seems 'warped'. Only that part, really strange. Even after an exchange, the same area showing the same issue. üò∞ I can still see some silver frame exposed. Else it's a really awesome case. 

Well, I'm back to my black Apple leather case. Feels the best overall. üôÇ"
"I'll take KI over CP any time.

CP has amazing rides, don't get me wrong, but I was disappointed with pretty much everything else about the park when I was there last week. Lines were insane. What good are rides if you can't actually get on them? Employees didn't care to enforce line rules. Half the park was closed (5 rides, half the bathrooms, half the restaurants). I get that COVID is affecting things these days, but KI seems to be handling it far better than CP."
Phish food by Ben and Jerry's is the best
If you're near a whole foods market they should have a water dispenser with alkaline water...mine does and it's delish
"Unfortunately, Costco optical and all the brands you named (except Kirkland) are Luxottica owned as well. All of those brands made quality products prior to their acquisition and now they are noticeably cheaper but selling for the same price."
Family tree.
"That's a valid perspective. I don't disagree. And I think GL is a good example of too much, too fast.

They wouldn't necessarily have to expand the park to offer something new though. A coaster with low ridership could be replaced, or a strip of restaurants/shops which aren't popular.

I could see Thunderhawk and Steel Force staying put indefinitely since they are well known classics. If I had to pick from the list, I'd go with replacing the Wild Mouse with maybe a spinning coaster like Cobra's Curse if they want to stick with a family friendly option, or a compact Intamin if they want to add another ride for thrill seekers. The Wild Mouse model is everywhere and unremarkable, so nothing unique to the park would be lost.

I agree that not every park has to be huge and cater to coaster enthusiasts. But it wouldn't hurt to put something new in some of these smaller parks. Just to remind their regulars that CF hasn't forgotten about them at least."
"Depends on your grip too 

However I confirm that the g203 is good 

But if you have a little more money check out the upcoming version of the model o (It should be 58g) or the cooler master mm710 (52g) or maybe you should try the model o (that for me works well having palm grip and is 67g ) all of these are at almost 50 dollars/euros 
(If you want to buy the model o or the new version go to the glorious website and if you're not from us scroll down to see the resellers.
If you want the cooler master you have to preorder it from amazon.com)"
I think the honor for lightest game on the list goes to Codenames.
"I chose to specialize instead. It means doing more classes in your program and less electives. You have to minor if you major at my school, so I specialized so I wouldn't have to minor."
