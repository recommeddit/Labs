"Pokemon The Movie 2000. 

My 10 year old mind was blown when [Slowking said the world would turn to ash, but then you find out the prophecy meant Ash!] (/spoiler)"
"i wish i studied marine biology, but knowing my mom she would say that degree would be useless so i took education instead and am becoming a teacher so she wouldn’t shame me"
"Fair enough. I personally have used the ones I recommended (I read 2-3 books a week), and before I posted ones that other people recommended I went to each and downloaded a copy of the book I’m currently reading, just to be sure it worked."
"Hi, I am looking for a device that is portable and light, and moderately powerful. I want a laptop mainly for schoolwork and for working away from home (libraries, cafes ect) therefore portability is a must, but I'd also like the device to handle certain programmes such as Vegas or Ableton so that I can also work and develop my hobbies in the meantime. Gaming capabilities are not a must though it would be a plus if this device could run games of the likes of minecraft, the sims and such."
"I sat here for a good 30 seconds trying to figure out what the lava lamp was in relation to.

It's a lamp. Right. I'll just hop on over to /r/drunk now, it'll be easier"
"Cydia’s main problem is that it’s too old and won’t work as well as a Cydia rewrite will on newer iOS versions. To add insult to injury, Saurik basically abandoned the project so it won’t be updated officially by him anymore. I personally still use Cydia but definitely wouldn’t mind using Zebra in the future because it’s basically a modern version of Cydia with the same UI but more modern."
"Take his word for it, I've only been there twice. I was just amazed how long it took to get from one end to the other compared to Washington, Boston, Philly, etc."
Windscribe is slower than other vpns. Look for threads on reddit
"I use an app called FBReader, I've been using it since I got my old HTC Inspire back in like... 2011?"
Awesome Calendar
"You may want to consider taking an introductory university course that's been made freely available online, such as [MIT's 6.00.1](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11) or [Harvard's CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). While they do not focus on web development, they will give you a deeper knowledge of general computer science principles that will pay dividends down the line. As you are still in high school, you have plenty of time to invest before you need to worry about what languages are wanted on the job market."
"I learned in marketing class that even if 5 out of 5 dentists recommend a toothpaste, the ad will still say ""4 out of 5 dentists"" because ""5 out of 5"" sounds too good to be true. 

Also, a toothpaste must be pretty shitty if a dentist wouldn't recommend using it."
nobody has?
"Cool, because there's a consistency between reviews and popularity. Protonvpn wouldn't be high on search engines if it wasn't for popularity. You've assured yourself that Proton is good and so have a lot of review sites. By extension, it's possible that reputable review sites are positive about other VPNs because they're also good."
"I mean really, is he a dentist or just some guy on the internet?! If I’m gonna change, I’d like to double check my source :)"
"In no particular order:

- Madoka Magica
- Steins;gate
- Paprika
- Spice & Wolf
- Princess Tutu
- Gankutsuou"
"I got to admit, when I heard Rickman is a nice guy I smiled....dude's awesome."
"Kings island because of all the amazing night rides, especially Mystic Timbers and Beast which have themes that go perfect with Halloween. And the park does a good job with decoration, scare actors etc."
"Check out Edomasa for cheap and decent sushi. It's more a late-night spot, opens at 6pm every night. I'll do Daily Grind if I'm looking for a bagel but don't expect NY/PHL bagel quality/taste."
"Depends where you live and the climate. If you are in a warm climate you should use lighter colognes and fragrances. The name of the sub-reddit about colognes slipped my mind, but it should be easy to find. You should head over there, the guys there know their colognes :)

Personally I wear Davidoff Cool Water durnig Spring and Summer and switch between Dior Homme, Issey Miyake and Calvin Klein Euphoria in the colder months."
"""Frah - gee - lay"""
Same and same on the CK One. Spotted a bottle at TJ Maxx the other day for about 20 bucks and I was \*thisclose\* to grabbing it for nostalgia's sake but I changed my mind last minute. I need to slow my roll...
They are the inchworm variety.
How would you find something like that?
