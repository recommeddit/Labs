56663,best desktop monitor,"I bought a Korean 27"" 1440p monitor as a temporary monitor a couple years ago and it's still going strong and I haven't felt the need to upgrade.  No dead pixels, VESA mounting, IPS, minimal backlight issues, runs at 110Hz, poor monitor controls and a flimsy frame but not a big deal.  Would I recommend it?  If you're on a budget it might be a good deal.  I haven't been monitor shopping for a while though so maybe they don't fill that niche anymore.  I bought it when 1440p was barely on the market and your option was to spend almost twice as much for a brand name one.  Don't do it just to save $50.  A quick check on Newegg shows plenty of sub $300 Acer 27"" monitors so I doubt I'd do it when I can just pick up one of those."
59580,best perfume,"Very individual, down to earth person. Like horses and sea. Not vegan."
68040,best science fiction novel,"I think most of PKD's books can be described as ahead of their time.  *A Scanner Darkly*, for example, portrays the damage, both physically and mentally, of drug use under a police state.  What with marijuana gaining legalization across the country and police abuse of authority garnering so much attention I'd say that's a much more prescient book for readers in 2015.  At the very least Dick's ability to distort reality and unreality seems more prophetic everyday."
21136,best workout music,"It's a song about not giving up, not accepting what other people tell you you cannot do and overcoming your boundaries to achieve your goal."
51539,best iphone case,"Caudabe makes quality cases and I’ve used them on two iPhones. The Sheath protected my 6s very well while maintaining a slim profile and so far this Lucid clear case for my Max is wonderful. So clear, so slim and such a good fit. Their customer service is excellent too."
5987,best programming language for web development,"I am also a PHP dev but no, don't choose PHP now. Choosing Node/js is better than PHP and choosing Go is better than Node at this moment to learn as a new language."
8099,best toothpaste,"That, or if they have to do a new survey they can always phrase the question as ""As a dentist, would you recommend that people use Colgate DentiPlus White Freeze Extreme, or that they don't brush their teeth ever and gargle Coke twice daily?"""
63153,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Is it worth getting Chimera/electra then? Or should I use unc0ver?
70657,best movies with a cool twist,"Yes, I would call it a plot twist. It wasn't an ""everything you thought you knew is wrong"" kind of plot twist, but it was a plot twist"
56398,best desktop monitor,Its coming.
30822,best country to live in,"If you're working in the tech/startup scene Switzerland will be the most boring Country to live in. We're years behind. Also people are so tech-unsavvy it's ridiculous. Oh and Netflix here is horrible (only available since one year, horrible choice of movies/shows. I'll constantly have to explain people what it is)."

7193,best iPhone,"Just replied to /u/radio_yyz regarding the SE, I think you're both right. Good shout on waiting until the next round of releases for a price drop. I should be able to eke another 1-2 months out of my poor, frail 6S...

Thanks"

12738,best gifts for mom,"My kids are now 21 and 23.  I ask for the same thing every year.  Don't argue, clean the house without being asked, and make me breakfast.  Still waiting to get that gift."
65674,best phone service company,This has been my experience in Arizona. AT&T is less congested than Verizon.
60923,Best comedy show on Netflix,Yeah I saw it was on there relatively recently.
13122,best gifts for mom,"Gift cards for food.  A LOT of people either bring food or the mom will have pre-made a ton of food, which tends to be a lot of lasagna...so gift cards to food places can be great.

A cleaning service, or for you to come over and clean.  It's easy in the first few weeks to get swamped learning new baby shit that the cleaning goes out the window.

Things you know the mom likes: Hand cream, magazines, books, candy, really great coffee.

Things you know moms always need: diapers, wipes, extra baby stuff no one thinks of until the last minute (infant tylenol, first aid stuff).

Other great ideas:  Slippers, a nice big but comfortable robe, more snacks, chapsticks, dry shampoo, subscriptions to things like audible or a meal service.

source: I am a mom and currently pregnant with twins and this is what I would be down to get."
9576,best toothpaste,Ah. That makes so much more sense.
