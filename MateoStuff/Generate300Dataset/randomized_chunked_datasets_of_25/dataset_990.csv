56663,"I bought a Korean 27"" 1440p monitor as a temporary monitor a couple years ago and it's still going strong and I haven't felt the need to upgrade.  No dead pixels, VESA mounting, IPS, minimal backlight issues, runs at 110Hz, poor monitor controls and a flimsy frame but not a big deal.  Would I recommend it?  If you're on a budget it might be a good deal.  I haven't been monitor shopping for a while though so maybe they don't fill that niche anymore.  I bought it when 1440p was barely on the market and your option was to spend almost twice as much for a brand name one.  Don't do it just to save $50.  A quick check on Newegg shows plenty of sub $300 Acer 27"" monitors so I doubt I'd do it when I can just pick up one of those.",best desktop monitor

68040,"I think most of PKD's books can be described as ahead of their time.  *A Scanner Darkly*, for example, portrays the damage, both physically and mentally, of drug use under a police state.  What with marijuana gaining legalization across the country and police abuse of authority garnering so much attention I'd say that's a much more prescient book for readers in 2015.  At the very least Dick's ability to distort reality and unreality seems more prophetic everyday.",best science fiction novel

13122,"Gift cards for food.  A LOT of people either bring food or the mom will have pre-made a ton of food, which tends to be a lot of lasagna...so gift cards to food places can be great.

A cleaning service, or for you to come over and clean.  It's easy in the first few weeks to get swamped learning new baby shit that the cleaning goes out the window.

Things you know the mom likes: Hand cream, magazines, books, candy, really great coffee.

Things you know moms always need: diapers, wipes, extra baby stuff no one thinks of until the last minute (infant tylenol, first aid stuff).

Other great ideas:  Slippers, a nice big but comfortable robe, more snacks, chapsticks, dry shampoo, subscriptions to things like audible or a meal service.
