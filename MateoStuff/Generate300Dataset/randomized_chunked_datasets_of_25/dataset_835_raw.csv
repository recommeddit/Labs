"Indeed!  I think you're being gracious on the less than one too!

Hence also why software development for the ""young person who hasn't gone to college yet"" is such the better choice.

People always like to throw around surgeons and investment bankers as great choices... which for a CERTAIN SUBSET of people that is true... it's just that random run of the mill 17 year old is UNLIKELY to belong to that subset.

It's like saying, ""Hey want to FI?  You should be a professional football player or CEO of a fortune 500 company and not blow all your money.""

I'll get RIGHT ON THAT."
Switch. It just has way better exclusive titles despite ps4 having bloodborne.

"I would seriously recommend this. It's easier to pick up (initially) than any of the others, and just far more fun. You can take it with you anywhere, everyone gets a huge kick out of it, and you'd be riding the high tide of the mid-to-late-00s ukulele resurgence. And best of all, of course, is that if you take it seriously, you can produce some absolutely amazing music. With the added bonus of people going ""wtfukulele?"" all the time."
"95% failure rate, yay!"
"I went to the bathroom once in middle school. There was a kid in there letting other kids kick him in the balls for $1. 

I know a bargain when I see it."
I wasn't going to buy one after all the mixed reviews but this monitor is pretty awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone.

"Mahjong Soul... I've been playing a really long time, but i think that it can be played just absolutely free... or at least you can play with friends or bots for free which helps you collect coins to use to play (and win more) in ranked games."
"Wow, didn't realize the library's development was winding down. Thanks for the heads up."
"Yeah, that's my favorite Bridgerton too."
"As a former baggage handler, I absolutely hated those big plastic suitcases.They were heavier, and if a nice soft leather suitcase hits you in the shin while you're stacking luggage in the pit, no biggie. One of these? You're out for a bit."
"Hop on the treadmill and put this song on by [Volbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdYIqfYehA). Put the treadmill setting at a slow pace to warm up. Then at 45 seconds crank it up to the highest (you can keep up with) and finish up the song at that setting.

For a tougher challenger you can do the same with Metallica's Master of Puppets and hit the high setting at 30 seconds into the song."
I prefer [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfCqnHgXwBo).
"Ah, interesting, we recently discussed this paper at work, but I haven't read it yet.

Have you read the 2010 update? Is that as good? (When in doubt, I try to go with the newer paper, in case previous findings have been refuted.)"
"""The Double Helix"" is Watson's account of the discovery, and goes into their dealings with Franklin in a fair amount of detail.  Might be interesting to read for some perspective, if you decide to present this paper.  Or even if you don't, it's a compelling book.  I read it in an evening--couldn't put it down."
Yep. I always make sure to have a few around each of the respective holiday.
"I will warn you that Montgomery is a turn of the 20th century author, everything she writes is definitely closed-door, and she's very old-fashioned, but she was also pretty progressive for her time, so her books aren't horrifyingly misogynistic or anything. I grew up reading her and read everything she ever wrote (minus her private diaries, but literally all her novels and short stories) so I'm kind of biased. Anne of Green Gables is pretty much my fave fish-out-of-water comedy/coming of age story of all time."
YNAB is super good overall for individuals and couples to manage cash flow in the good wheel. Me and my partner also have a share account and we use YNAB to monitor our income and expenses at the end of the day.
really? even now that is out of beta?
