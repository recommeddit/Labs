5801,"I want to add my $0.02. PHP isn't bad, but it can be if you're a bad developer. Therefore the argument is that ""good"" languages prevent you from being an idiot, while PHP doesn't. While this makes PHP not as sexy as say Python or Ruby, its overboard to deter people from using it. It has a lot of practical uses, iirc Apache is supported by like every web host and there is a lot of job opportunity developing CMS's 

And it's not like its an exclusive choice, just pick a programming language that you like and then base your web dev experience off of that.",best programming language for web development

12,"If you use ssh to get to other computer file systems then mc is the easiest one to use for that. That being said, nnn is my goto tool since it's blazing fast even on low powered machines like the Raspberry pi. It has single key shortcuts, navigate as you type functionality and the smallest footprint possible. A good basic knowledge of shell commands like cd and mkdir is always useful but once you get into bulk renaming and multiple file name and file type moving then a fast file manager is the right tool.
If you would like to have image and file previews as you navigate then ranger is the one for you but keep in mind that this feature is amazing on fast machines while it becomes a nightmare on slow ones.",best terminal file manager reddit

55601,"it wasn't the size of the book, it was the premise. i knew it was a long series, and i just wanted to know a little more about it until i started it. i had not heard of it before i found the book. but anyway, i started it yesterday, because even in the event that i don't like the story SO much as to continue the series, i really wanted to give it a try, i love fantasy.

and i have to say that so far, i'm enjoying it very much. i just got to the part where Richard gets chosen. I like the characters; i don't know a lot about the worlds yet to say anything about that, but i like the premise so far. thank you for your reply, i wanted to hear some opinions, but i knew i was going to try it anyway, and i'm glad i did :)",best action and adventure novel series
