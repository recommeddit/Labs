25814,best cricket teams of all time,"That's a big call. Agreed weaker teams were worse in the 1980s but in 2000 there were some abysmal teams, even India who snapped their win record in 2001 had very good batsman but some pretty ropey bowling."
61820,Best RPG game on PS4,"just be warned that the second playthrough, while interesting, is nothing special. The third playthrough is truly phenomenal though."
22680,best celebrity,Oh shit... it wasn't Kurt Russell... edited.
4957,best home improvement store,"Hd, never like Lowe‚Äôs or ace"
15716,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Cubitts](https://www.cubitts.co.uk/sunglasses)

For anyone in the UK, Cubitts is a great brand to consider for good construction, a solid range of modern styles, and great price:quality."
47495,best state to visit in the United States,"How far things have gone...I used to walk the Pike Market, enjoying the smell of fresh fish, the ocean, the people shopping for the day and the tourists, on a weekend off from my job as a mechanic. And the clubs and the cheap nightlife, live music and bands back when Nirvana and  Pearl Jam were coming up. I was young, my family had worked the tugboats along the harbour, gone into the wars, turned the wrench, hauled freight and raised families.

Last time I visited was a few years back, seemed Amazon and general gentrification had transformed the place to something unrecognized. I couldn't smell the sea."
72575,best keyboard switches,"As everyone else has said already it's all personal preference, I thought for sure I'd like blues or browns for typing and gaming, and I'm not a massive fan for either, I prefer linears.  I've just picked up a board with Gateron Yellow switches on, my favourite so far, a bit harder than Cherry Red and a bit softer than Cherry Black, plus Gateron switches are much smoother to press than Cherry switches (which are a little scratchy) which is a bonus."
38467,best newspapers to read,"I do. I wake up and there's three of them lying around me. What do you expect me to do? Can't disappoint them, can I?"
10333,best suitcase lock,A small gun you say? Can I buy one of those at an airport kiosk?
4616,best text editor,"I personally use vim for text editing, Atom sometimes, and Leafpad for an equivalent of notepad.exe"
39184,best web browser,"I'd say Firefox. I used it a few years ago, switched to Chrome and now switched back because of the quantum update. Firefox' scrolling is way smoother imo and you can also use most Chrome extension with the help of an addon. The mobile version is great because you can use most of the desktop add-ons. Also: more privacy than Chrome."
38586,best newspapers to read,Yes nagpurkar here :D rahan dhantolit
60183,best freezer brand,"Fwiw, he only gave you one brand really; all of those are owned by Whirlpool."
54167,best medicine for a cold,"I would argue that the politicians ruined it for everyone.  Meth heads may have been the pressure they were responding to, but at the end of the day, it was still lawmakers who put pen to paper and passed the 2005 CMEA into law.  They had the option to do nothing.  They had the option to say ""Yes, meth is a problem, but it's not in the spirit of a free country to turn innocent sinus sufferers into collateral damage in the effort to stop meth production.""

But no, they passed the law and the rest of us have to suffer until we can get it repealed."
39723,best podcast for biologists,"I'm loving your podcast, I've been listenening to it while I prep microscope slides at my internship! Can't wait to hear the next episode üëç"
43359,best ad service for mobile applications,I'm using adMob in my current apps from last 2-3 years & everything seems Fine till now.
69809,best major to study in college,"Something you enjoy that has a job market. Don‚Äôt spend the first half of your life miserable in the hopes of enjoying the second half. If you can‚Äôt enjoy working at least most of the time, you‚Äôre doing it wrong."
72863,best Linux distro,I wonder where Qubes or NixOS fall in these lists. ü§î
41359,best instrument to play,Autoharp.
50785,best rap album,How did you make that chart?
39196,best web browser,"Firefox because of Quantum, plus the user face is more user-friendly and there are plenty of add-ons and, more importantly, themes."
22747,best celebrity,"Believe it or not, Marilyn Manson. This was 2000. My brother had cancer and got the chance to meet him. He brought my brother all sorts of memorabilia and sat and chatted to him for a few hours, playing TV games with him, playing guitar, even reading Beano comics. All in the comfort of my own home. My brother passed away 3 weeks later and was in his M.M t-shirt when he passed."
26657,best board games,"**Saboteur** (and **Saboteur 2**, the expansion) - 3-~10 players (more with the expansion). Everyone we have introduced to loves this damn game.  Build a mine, screw over other miners, get paranoid. 2 games, just buy them both.


I think **Bring your own Book** is great - like cards against humanity but everyone has a book to find an answer to the prompt in. How clean or raunchy it is depends on players

Edit: **Red Dragon Inn** is a great 'take that"" game"
68777,best science fiction novel,I like how  Ender's Shadow is on the list.
30299,best Mexican war to study,"It sounds way more cool in Latin:

    Carthago delenda est."
