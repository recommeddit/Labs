58217,best cologne,Out of curiosity what type of store do you find cedarwood soap at. I live in a decent size city so unless it is super rare I would like to try it.
28440,best breakfast foods,I add tabasco
28738,best breakfast foods,"There are people who downvote damned near anything. I think it amuses them to be generally mean, because they have a low threshold for amusement."
59961,best perfume,Nautica voyage always have to keep a bottle
70080,best major to study in college,"I'M NOT APART OF YA SYSTEM  
  
EDIT: I'M AN ADUULLLLTTTTTT"
18916,best YouTube video,"How is 24 million views ""unknown""...?"
31179,best country to live in,"Parts of the USA, in the right fields. 

You need an advanced degree though, and to know just the right thing at the right time to get you that perfect position."
27471,best bollywood actor,"I'm actually going to be watching my first Bachchan (I think) movie in like an hour. It's called ""Badla"" I hope it's good."
7194,best iPhone,My girlfriend got the SE and it is pretty nice even compared to my XS. If I didn’t prefer the full screen OLED Display it would also be an option for me. Even if I sometimes miss TouchID these days when wearing a mask and having to unlock my phone with FaceID.
60255,best freezer brand,They make my chest cold.
52968,best hiphop album,i’ll have to check it out cuz i love madlib production. ie: madvilliany and no more parties in la
59796,best perfume,Viktor & Rolf; Flowerbomb.
16067,best sunglasses for fashion,"I've gotten ray bans, shwood twice, saint laurent twice, dior, zegna, Oliver peoples, and celine sunglasses using this method. Probably spent around $300 for $5000 worth of sunglasses."
16375,best sunglasses for fashion,"http://www.zennioptical.com/

I would recommend checking out this website. You can get some pretty good looking prescription glasses/sunglasses customizable to your needs for VERY CHEAP. If you want to invest $200 into raybands, go ahead, this isnt the site for you. But if you want to spend $20-$40 on a pair, try it"
4715,best home improvement store,"My HD has 2 guys I avoid like the plague, because they are so good. For more complicated projects these two usually have better ideas and when I need something they walk me right to it. I avoid them at first so I can wander around the store without feeling like I'm insulting them after I get everything I need. I want to wander without carrying everything"
62140,Best RPG game on PS4,Demons's Souls
55621,best action and adventure novel series,"I'd highly recommend The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever.
Features an INCREDIBLY conflicted anti-hero, memorable characters, and fantastical creatures and places. A great read if you want a darker, more adult fantasy."
13536,best research paper archive,"Based on my experiences in graduate school, I would 100% chalk this up to professors being busy and missing the emails. I often have to email faculty I work with three or four times before they see the email and respond. It's nothing personal, they're just so insanely busy they don't see everything the first (or second) time it comes.

Besides, there's always SciHub if you really need a paper urgently."
33869,best Pokemon game,"Honestly if you're looking for a good starting point I'd just go with the Gen 1 remakes (Fire Red and Leaf Green). Every subsequent set of games builds on the previous set in various ways, so Gen 1 is the most straight forward experience. The remakes add a lot of quality of life changes, so *definitely* play those over the actual original games. 

If you just want to cut to the chase and play the best, then Black and White 2 or Heart Gold and Soul Silver is probably what you should go with."
17261,best iOS game,"I really wish capcom took their ios releases more seriously, their MH stuff is mostly forgotten about and never updated"
58655,best cologne,"TF Noir Extreme

Zoologist Panda

Givenchy Gentlemen

Polo Red Extreme

PDM Oajan"
45179,best items under $100,My YSL Opium.
53614,best medicine for a cold,"I’m a big fan of Bronkaid when I get bronchitis. It’s actually intended for people with asthma as far as I know, but it contains ephedrine and guaifenesin, but is intended to work as a bronchiodialator, so it really works to open up your airways. Plus the ephedrine just sort of numbs or toned down all the shitty feelings of being sick, but gives you plenty of energy instead of putting you to sleep. 


Do your research before taking my advice. People can definitely react poorly to ephedrine, and like I said, this is not the intended use of this medication. But it definitely works for me. Also it’s cheap as balls for like 40 pills."
60594,Best comedy show on Netflix,"B99 is my favorite comedy of all time... it’s what you want Parks & Rec or the Office to be, but it pulls it off. Black Books is a personal favorite show, Broadchurch is a good crime binge, Schitt’s Creek is a good comedy, British Baking Show warms the soul, The Good Place moves fairly quickly (season two loses steam but 3/4 slam the point home beautifully), Lovesick is fun and easy to finish in a weekend."
55676,best action and adventure novel series,The Lensman series.
