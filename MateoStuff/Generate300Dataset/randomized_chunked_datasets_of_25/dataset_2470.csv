I would recommend checking out this website. You can get some pretty good looking prescription glasses/sunglasses customizable to your needs for VERY CHEAP. If you want to invest $200 into raybands, go ahead, this isnt the site for you. But if you want to spend $20-$40 on a pair, try it",best sunglasses for fashion

I avoid them at first so I can wander around the store without feeling like I'm insulting them after I get everything I need. I want to wander without carrying everything",best home improvement store

13536,"Based on my experiences in graduate school, I would 100% chalk this up to professors being busy and missing the emails. I often have to email faculty I work with three or four times before they see the email and respond. It's nothing personal, they're just so insanely busy they don't see everything the first (or second) time it comes.

Besides, there's always SciHub if you really need a paper urgently.",best research paper archive
33869,"Honestly if you're looking for a good starting point I'd just go with the Gen 1 remakes (Fire Red and Leaf Green). Every subsequent set of games builds on the previous set in various ways, so Gen 1 is the most straight forward experience. The remakes add a lot of quality of life changes, so *definitely* play those over the actual original games. 

If you just want to cut to the chase and play the best, then Black and White 2 or Heart Gold and Soul Silver is probably what you should go with.",best Pokemon game

53614,"I’m a big fan of Bronkaid when I get bronchitis. It’s actually intended for people with asthma as far as I know, but it contains ephedrine and guaifenesin, but is intended to work as a bronchiodialator, so it really works to open up your airways. Plus the ephedrine just sort of numbs or toned down all the shitty feelings of being sick, but gives you plenty of energy instead of putting you to sleep. 


Do your research before taking my advice. People can definitely react poorly to ephedrine, and like I said, this is not the intended use of this medication. But it definitely works for me. Also it’s cheap as balls for like 40 pills.",best medicine for a cold
60594,"B99 is my favorite comedy of all time... it’s what you want Parks & Rec or the Office to be, but it pulls it off. Black Books is a personal favorite show, Broadchurch is a good crime binge, Schitt’s Creek is a good comedy, British Baking Show warms the soul, The Good Place moves fairly quickly (season two loses steam but 3/4 slam the point home beautifully), Lovesick is fun and easy to finish in a weekend.",Best comedy show on Netflix
