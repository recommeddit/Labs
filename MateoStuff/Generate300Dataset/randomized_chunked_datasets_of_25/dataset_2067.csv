42218,"Oh, easily. Imagine you're watching Star Wars, and in the opening of A New Hope, a voiceover says ""Luke, the son of Darth Vader, sets out with his secret sister Leia to become a jedi and thwart the empire"". 

That's what the voiceover does. It flat-out spells out the major twists in the movie, and explicitly, not like *hint-hint* sorta thing. It's mind-boggling why it made it in, and threw me off when I first saw it, since I didn't expect the twist to be something they explained in the first lines of the film. 

I highly recommend Googling it after you've seen the movie.",movies like Inception

Everyone's like ohhhh its minerally its soooo healthy for you mm best water yes I ONLY DRINK FIJI WATER how dare u even get any other water and  


Its absolutely disgusting.  
I grew up in the midwest. Tap water was basically undrinkable in some areas. I went to a summer camp (International Music Camp at the border of US and Canada) and had some water from a fountain because I was super thirsty and immediately spit it out and went and paid for water instead (The next time I attended that camp I brought a gallon of my home tap water with me).  
My home tap water wasnt even that much better. Chemically-chlorine tasting.  
Moved to Oregon, nice tap water, doesnt taste like death most places.  
My dad bought a case of Fiji water for a road trip we went on to visit my Grandparents and I cracked one open because I was thirsty and I immediately thought I was going to barf. Sour to holy hell, overly mineralized, borderline salty, tasted like death.  
Thought I just had a bad one. Took a drink from my brother's Fiji water because it'd been in the cooler and was cold.  
Slightly more palatable but still disgusting.

A benefit is being able to omit a 3rd party http lib in the browser bundle saves Kbs.

We now have a good-enough-in-many-cases option that is **browser native**, and using it on the server adds no more overhead than Axios. 

It's ok if this doesn't motivate you. 

The `fetch` interface isn't as clean in an absolute sense. However it's not nearly as bad as I once thought. 

(I'm hoping to promote & share better `fetch` patterns than I was initially aware of. Some of the patterns I'm still working on - specifically timeouts, and upload progress. The interface design isn't quite right yet...)

Some people may want to move to modern & standard APIs. Eventually `fetch` might be easier to teach & find hobbyists with prior experience. (Meaning it'll be used from docs to framework examples.)",axios alternatives reddit
