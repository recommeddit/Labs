33985,"Welcome to the series. 

The Let’s Go games are a great place to start to learn type advantage and basic battle strategies. They are a bit on the unique side with their catching mechanics, and only offer up the original 151. It is a little on the easy side, but it’s a very casual experience. 

If your looking to dive into the core series, then sword and shield would be a good fit. It offers the usual battling experience with lots of options in terms of team building. Online scene is still pretty strong, and the DLC adds in two new areas to explore. You don’t need the DLC to receive the Pokémon that were added in; they can be traded and transferred into your game. 

Hope this helps and have fun.",best Pokemon game

67875,"I've been on a Sci-fi binge for a while now and have been going through all the most popular ones. My top ones  would likely be something like

1. Sphere
1. Seveneves
1. Children of Time
1. Bobiverse books
1. The Expanse books
1. Red Rising
1. Rendezvous with Rama
1. House of Suns
1. Altered Carbon 1 and 2
1. Pushing Ice

Probably more I'm forgetting, those are just from the last few years. I'm still working my way down the list of the most popular series. I've dropped many I'll have to go back to and try again. Expeditionary force was pretty interesting until Skippy ruined it. I couldn't get into Hyperion at all, I need to try it again I guess. Same with Pandora's star. Three Body Problem is really popular, but definitely not to my taste, I've tried it 3 times and made it about 80% of the way in before saying nope. 

I'm pretty particular and very picky, I like ""believable science"" and especially a focus on first contact with aliens that are *actually alien*. I don't like magic pretending to be technology like magic faster than light travel and magical blue beams that are totally science lasers and not ki blasts from Dragonball.

I get REALLY salty when aliens are like Star Wars ""aliens"", where the ""aliens"" are just humans with green or blue skin. They act like humans, talk like humans, look like humanoids, and even use VERY similar body language and physical speech patterns to humans. 

Lame. If I wanted to read about humans, I'd be reading non-fiction. 

I like aliens that are *actually* alien. Sadly, those are fairly hard to find, so basically none of the ones on my list have aliens / don't have great aliens. The ""aliens"" in Children of Time are very good examples of ""good aliens"" IMO. They have completely different technology, completely different society, completely different biology, completely different mannerisms and their actions don't even make sense to humans etc. They aren't just humans with blue scales on their skin, they are *actually alien* despite not *actually being aliens*",best science fiction novel

32102,"MONA museum of old and new art in Tasmania, Australia. 

First of all it’s the most incredible museum, after travelling in Europe and visiting many world renown museums I can confidently say that this place is miles ahead of the game. 
It also has a small number of architecturally designed standalone apartments on the grounds, each completely different from the next.
We arrived via the MONA Catamaran and were escorted to our apartment via golf cart, with a tour of the grounds on the way. Our apartment was the “Walter” and was a 2 story block, which basically looked liked a square had been tipped up on its edge (kind of hard to explain).
It featured the biggest beds I have ever seen, with what might as well be 10billion thread count sheets, a tv that came out of the roof via remote, a climate controlled wine fridge full of beautiful wine, stacks of art books and a view over the river. Not to mention an infinity pool, breakfast at the on site restaurant and early access to the museum the following morning.

This was the fanciest thing I have ever done.",best hotel to live in
