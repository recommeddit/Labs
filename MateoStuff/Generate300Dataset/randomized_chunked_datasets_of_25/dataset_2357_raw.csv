"I have a good recipe:

2oz Absinthe
2oz milk (cow)
1oz vodka
1oz crème de menthe

Shake over ice and serve in a martini glass.

I made this drink for three of my closest friends and they couldn't stand even one sip. So I downed theirs for them. I had a dream I was fighting a dragon that night. In the morning I found I had ripped everything off the walls in my bathroom: mirrors, towel holders, even curtain rods. GREAT DRINK 10/10."
"Literally exactly what I did, for the same reasons. And in the same currency... but not the part about being able to afford it. 

Coming from a 7, it’s a gigantic upgrade anyway. Really happy with it so far!"
I miss living just an hour away from the Adirondacks
"Do you have allergies?  I had 3 different dentists over the years tell me I needed to brush my gums better because they were swollen, despite following a good dental hygiene routine.   It wasn't until my current dentist asked the question whether or not I had allergies that I found  out the real reason for my swollen gums.  Took OTC allergy meds for several days before my next appointment... no issues."
"Walter Jon Williams: Hardwired and Voice of the Whirlwind - intelligent cyberpunk and action. 

David Drake's Hammer's Slammers books - future mercenary warfare with lots of tanks and shooting. 

Timothy Zahn's Cobra and Blackcollar books. 

For quantity of action, the already mentioned Asher and Hamilton are hard to beat."
Oh thats sad. I tink its still not available in few countries.
"As someone who went into the usual suspects unspoiled, the ending blew my fucking mind."
"Knowing a signature attraction *is* knowing a park... what are you talking about? Signature attractions are the things that put parks on the map. Far more enthusiasts *and* GP give a shit about Carowinds now that Fury is there.

Of course people still have never heard of it – I'm sure there are people in Charlotte that have never heard of it. But the fundamental reality is that most people don't travel. I'm sure loads of people loosely have Kingda Ka on their bucket list but will never get to New Jersey. Similarly loads of people have seen Fury and would like to ride it some day but probably aren't about to plan a trip to the Carolinas.

I don't know why you're getting so hung up on the ""enthusiast bubble"" qualifier. Loads of people haven't heard of Knoebels, including many unenlightened enthusiasts, but Knoebels is still world-famous."

"Yeah, but you probably don’t need the last `then` since it’s just returning the same value that it was passed."
"Issey Miyake and Velvet Rope. 

I think Velvet Rope is a nice fall perfume."
"S'mores - local place by me in NJ does a graham cracker ice cream, with chocolate chips and marshmallow mixed in.  It's fucking intense."
"I was in Santa Cruz last year and Manzi this year.

Santa Cruz had way cooler and more interesting people in it, but the nice thing about Manzi is that the bathrooms are individual (there’s like 3-5 per floor) instead of locker room style. The rooms in Santa Cruz were nicer too, but Manzi is closer to Carillo which is the best dining commons in my opinion. These are the really big differences I noticed, besides this AMA"
Between librivox for audiobooks and  Gutenberg project for ebooks I am getting all my classics of my too read list.
What about them?
But when you leave for the night you ain't comin' back.
"If you go into System Settings > Keyboard > custom, you can apply a Mac OS profile for hotkeys but even after a reboot it doesn’t make a difference."
"The important bit is to create a wrapper / abstraction that ensures separation between application code and apis like this. Refactoring to use the module of the day, or even better to replace the module of the day with a native api, then becomes a matter of updating <100 lines vs your whole app."

"I'll put it like this, my previous gaming monitor was the AW2518HF, so pretty nice, 240hz and all that but a tn panel and before that it was an older 27""/1440/144 MSI with a va panel and the LG is much clearer and really good colors. Just my two cents."

"1440p I can get 144hz in most games (some games like modern warfare I have to turn stuff down for 144fps)

It's a great gpu for the price"
