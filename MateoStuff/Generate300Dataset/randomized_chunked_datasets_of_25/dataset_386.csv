I met Tre Cool of Green Day in 97. They're touring after the release of Nimrod, and I'm at the front door waiting with a couple friends to get in for the show. I'm, what, 14 15 at the time. He steps out the front door and walks past me, and my mind reels. He walks past the line (huge at this point, around the block) and into the music shop next to Bogarts. We follow him in, he's placing an order or something. When he finishes up he turns around and sees us. We're obviously there for the show, all decked out in our green day swag. He grins and starts the conversation (good, because we were nervous kids unsure how he'd react). It was awesome. He asked if we were there for the show, asked what our favorite songs were, if we played any instruments - I told him Mike was the reason I picked up Bass. He signed my shirt, some CDs, stuff. Then he said to hold on while he got his order, and escorted us back to the front of the line. Told the bouncer we had been there and he was the show tonight and wanted us back at the front. I was surprised he noticed that part. Dude was amazing - my favorite band then, and now, and the whole time in between, and they're all incredible. I've met them all now and they're really very nice and personable. BillieJoe is very sarcastic, Mike is really down to earth, kinda quiet, Tre is loud and happy. It's cool. I haven't met Jason White, that would be cool, but yea. Green Day are awesome guys.",best celebrity
