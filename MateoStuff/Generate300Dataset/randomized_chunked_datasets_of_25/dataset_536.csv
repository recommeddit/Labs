> 
If I finish my term in office … and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don’t upset anybody. High approval rating means you’re skiing down the slope and you never fall. Well, you’re skiing the baby slope, for goodness’ sakes. Go to a steeper slope. You always want to press, and you want to tackle the issues that are unpopular, that nobody else will go after."
3533,best college for research,Why tf is BYU so high? It's an objectively terrible place to go to college if you aren't a devout Mormon
11998,best gifts for dad,"Thank, and same to you.  Be sure to hug the rascal(s) :)"
12329,best gifts for mom,"A weekend away, get grandparents to look after the kids and take your wife away for some grown up time. I've booked a little trip to Edinburgh for myself and my wife. It's a win win as I get away from the kids and have time with the woman I love. 

Also as someone else posted, buy her a book and put in it a voucher that gives her the time to read it and the kids some time with Daddy."
13828,best research paper archive,I always like [George Miller's *The Magical Number Seven (Plus or Minus Two)*.](http://cogprints.org/730/1/miller.html)
473,best terminal file manager reddit,Looks good. Jarun's googler is a good project. Trying it out.
54429,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I have a mid hien, soft zero and hayate otsu v2. I swear to god my Zero is faster than my hien? Not really sure what is going on with it. 

I've read that Artisan has recently shipped out wrong pads to people? IDK."
68495,best science fiction novel,"Nah I did too. I was enjoying the first few stories, found it intriguing, but then it all goes nowhere and has that rage inducing cliffhanger ending so you’re compelled to read the next book. Which I hated but read for the sake of completion.

By the end I felt like I’d just wasted a lot do time and got nothing out of it."
27529,best bollywood actor,"He is my favourite... but feel really really sad for him these days don't know why he is choosing to do film with big stars(fanney khan, shimla mirchi, that anil kapoor movie) instead of good scripts like Ayushmaan did."
73763,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Hm. I know if that was me because I don’t remember writing about it, but I do slide on the dock all the time. I’m glad it works for you anyway!"
68256,best science fiction novel,"[Hmmm, this is getting interesting.] (https://youtu.be/F0yFyW7Ysps)"
7651,best laptop for general use,"What's your budget?
And yes integrated graphics can run Hades."
65159,best phone service company,"Google Fi. They use multiple carriers worldwide as their network. Best carrier I have had, and especially the best with travel to the EU with by far.

They also have the most consumer friendly data plan I have ever seen. It's $10 per gigabyte for the first 6gb, which is pretty standard if not a little spendy, but once you hit 6gb it automatically just becomes unlimited. If I stay around wifi for the month I just bay the $20 base for calls and texts, but if I travel I know I will never have to pay more than $60 for my data no matter how much I use it. 

It entirely removes the possibility of huge bills for over use of data, and data is part of the exact same plan in most EU countries as it is in the US. I've use it in Italy, Greece, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, UK, and probably more I'm forgetting, all without paying more than I would for the same usage in the US and without any sort of special plan.

That said, I haven't traveled internationally since January 2020 thanks to all the fun the world has been having, but with all the lock downs I'm always on wifi, so at least it's cheap!"
34510,best NFL player,How so? He seems like the bro who says the most annoying shit all of the time in your discussion classes.
58240,best cologne,Sport colognes honestly just have more citrus or mandarin in them.
1970,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Pizza varies a lot in style. Whether or not you’re a deep dish, or a New York fan, they’re all still pizza. We can accept that some styles are different without shitting on them so much."
6218,best Netflix documentary,"I loved business of drugs, one of the best documentary shows I've ever seen"
28635,best breakfast foods,"Where I'm from, [dosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa), [idli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli), and [pongal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pongal_(dish) are popular choices for breakfast with [chutney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutney) and [sambar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_(dish) as side dishes!

South Indian. :)"
53266,best usb c charging cable,"Just saying, cables are just little wires wrapped in plastic and sometimes fabric. Just be more careful, imagine playing with a safety pin, bending it back and forth, how many times would you have to bend it for it to break?

If you want an extremely durable cable, you may have to diy. Otherwise, you can just focus on treating your cables like they're fragile wires with little plugs soldered to each end. I haven't had a bad cable in years, and I too once thought I was just dealing with cheaply made cables. 

Again, diy might be an avenue you could explore. Then you could adjust length and thickness to your every desire, and a C to C cable is fairly simple to put together."
42913,best detective show,"I’m currently watching I’ll be gone in the dark.  Next is Perry Mason.  Another great HBO original is Six Feet Under, it is what motivated me to get into the death care industry."

58476,best cologne,">after I came on him

15464,best tree for the garden,"I've personally found Ace rub to perform rather poorly in suburban soil. Same case with  Liq sty - it loathes alkaline soil from what I've read / been told. Really beautiful tree, though. 

Ame can can grow up to 15-20m (but will take rather long) so it's really more a tree I think? 

I also want to add Cornus alternifolia, because it's a part of a trio of flowering trees that I really like, the other two being Cer can and Ame can."
61965,Best RPG game on PS4,Absolutely agree with Nioh! It's such a gem!
