If I finish my term in office … and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don’t upset anybody. High approval rating means you’re skiing down the slope and you never fall. Well, you’re skiing the baby slope, for goodness’ sakes. Go to a steeper slope. You always want to press, and you want to tackle the issues that are unpopular, that nobody else will go after.",best politician

65159,"Google Fi. They use multiple carriers worldwide as their network. Best carrier I have had, and especially the best with travel to the EU with by far.

They also have the most consumer friendly data plan I have ever seen. It's $10 per gigabyte for the first 6gb, which is pretty standard if not a little spendy, but once you hit 6gb it automatically just becomes unlimited. If I stay around wifi for the month I just bay the $20 base for calls and texts, but if I travel I know I will never have to pay more than $60 for my data no matter how much I use it. 

It entirely removes the possibility of huge bills for over use of data, and data is part of the exact same plan in most EU countries as it is in the US. I've use it in Italy, Greece, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, UK, and probably more I'm forgetting, all without paying more than I would for the same usage in the US and without any sort of special plan.

That said, I haven't traveled internationally since January 2020 thanks to all the fun the world has been having, but with all the lock downs I'm always on wifi, so at least it's cheap!",best phone service company

53266,"Just saying, cables are just little wires wrapped in plastic and sometimes fabric. Just be more careful, imagine playing with a safety pin, bending it back and forth, how many times would you have to bend it for it to break?

If you want an extremely durable cable, you may have to diy. Otherwise, you can just focus on treating your cables like they're fragile wires with little plugs soldered to each end. I haven't had a bad cable in years, and I too once thought I was just dealing with cheaply made cables. 

Again, diy might be an avenue you could explore. Then you could adjust length and thickness to your every desire, and a C to C cable is fairly simple to put together.",best usb c charging cable

Ame can can grow up to 15-20m (but will take rather long) so it's really more a tree I think? 

I also want to add Cornus alternifolia, because it's a part of a trio of flowering trees that I really like, the other two being Cer can and Ame can.",best tree for the garden
