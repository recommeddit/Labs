"Stardew Valley, Hyper light drifter, Echoes of Aeons, Can you still get Chaos Rings? Those were great. As you can see I love RPG's."
I went with the Nomad Rugged black leather case made from Horween leather. Great company with quality products. It will match my airpods case nicely.
"Really? I'm sure we could both cherry-pick articles to support our point of view, but I had the opposite impression. They're definitely not anti-war, at least."
"Veggie pancakes/fritters.

https://www.veganosity.com/vegan-oil-free-zucchini-carrot-fritters/

Last time I made them, I left out the onions and sage, added in half a pound of cooked ground turkey and frozen corn, meant to add in cheese but forgot, used 2 real eggs instead of flax eggs, added in a half cup of yogurt, and accidently bought limes at the store instead of lemons--and maybe all of that is why my fritters weren't at all crispy (but oh well, they're still good). 

One batch fit on a cookie pan, so if you've got multiple cookie pans, it would be worth it to make more batches at once! Then just freeze them and pop one or two in the microwave on your way out the door.

If you have a juicer, you could also juice the veggies, drink the juice, and use the pulp--that's basically what the process in the recipe about to anyway."
Or that Gene Upshaw was replaced with this Eugene fella!

It's a refreshing scent. I usually use it during the day as feels like to me a very chill time. Like how a crisp beach should smell like.
"Yea. When I’m doing a project, I alternate the stores. Let’s me give the impression to the employees that I don’t forget nearly as much as I do!"
"K so I’ve pretty much had every domestic pet you can have. Rabbits, ferrets, lizards, cats, dogs, horses, exotic parrots etc. 

Easy lizards, like geckos or anoles would be a good bet. I had anoles/longtailed lizards when I was a kid, it was one of my first pets, and they’re insanely easy to take care of. Plus you do get to touch them (minimally, anoles tend to bite even though it’s not painful, it’s like a dull pinch). 

Leopard geckos were my favorite because they’re super docile. 
Parakeets are pretty easy too. The budgie/cockatiel types even. Be aware that you guys may be allergic to the down feather dust. 

Fish can be a pain in the ass but overall once you get a tank set up (water at the right PH, nitrate and nitrite balances etc) they’re really easy to maintain. But that probably won’t suit a kid that wants a cuddly pet. 
Otherwise, someone above suggested volunteering at a shelter. That’s genius. You don’t have any responsibility and plenty of shelters are looking for people to help socialize animals, particularly cats (as I’m aware of) since they’re usually filled with them. Dogs a little less so because some no-kill shelters have more aggressive types that wouldn’t suit young children. 
Or you can always make friends with people that have pets. Then it’s not your burden. I have to say, as a kid I hung out with far too many people simply because I wanted to see their dogs/horses/what have you than I should admit lol."
King of Tokyo is probably the game I have given the most as a gateway game. Everyone but one person has loved it.
Throw in Link to the Past and she'll be set for a while.
"Funny, but Sac State the country kid? Wtf lol. And Berkeley is off too, needs more 'stressed out all the time' and 'super political.'"
thank you.     I watched 1 episode of The Spy and may return to it.   Not into anime/superhero stuff.    Have also seen Mr Robot but did not continue after season 2.
"Finally I see some HighFocus guys on here, I also recommend Dirty Dike, Ocean wisdom and Leafdog"
How do you get Lowe's 20% off coupons?
"Love Anker. They also have lifetime warranty, just received my replacement last week."
">  When equal access to those things is taken away from groups by groups, I think a worse affront to liberty has been done than making a shop sell equally to everyone.

Im not disagreeing with you.



However, just because others do doesnt mean you should call them racists or insult them. Just say you disagree with their position. Libertarians disagree that people should be forced to sell to people who they dont want to sell to. Its not racist. You can respectfully disagree all you want, but its a legitimate political difference."

"I was just browsing the Maui Jim website and wondered if you had a preference for the lens color (grey, bronze, rose, or green)?"
"Saw a bidet at my friend's house a few months ago. Had never used one, and she briefly explained how they work.

I learned something that day. Namely, that you aren't supposed to actually *shit in it*."
"> His average is just below 60 with over 12 000 runs. Can't dispute that

Well, there's the issue of the quality of opponents he's faced for the majority of his career"
