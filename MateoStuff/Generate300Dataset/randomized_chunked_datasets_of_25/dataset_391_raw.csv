"Dragonball Z Abridged. It’s hardly even dragonball. It’s like they took a show that existed and was way too long, shortened it down and dubbed over it, made an entirely new plot that’s better than the original, and made it absolutely hilarious. I watched the entire series three times now, and I never even watched Dragon ball growing up.

Make it through the first 2-3 and you’re gold!"

I've seen this list a few times throughout the years when shopping for new books. This is not recent at all; it's at least a few years old.
"Last time I bought a washer I looked at reviews for a top rated one then price shopped. At the time Lowe's was the best price, but I felt no loyalty to them."
"Came here to say this, I love this show"
Have you used any Novelkeys or Dixie Mech/Omnitype desk mats? That’s what I currently use and was looking to see which Artisan was essentially a better version of it. I tried a worn GSR-SE from a friend and played way worse with it for reference lol. 800dpi .4 sens in Valorant
FTL
That's what I'm talkin' bout
"This is the obvious one, but mad Max fury road. Easily one of the best action movies I’ve ever seen. Raiders is also an all time great"
"I am indeed, still waiting for Android 10 as well. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. 

Thanks again :)"
"There is literally no reason to any other camera than the C920. The 922 is a pile of hot garbage. But if youre only streaming at 720p, the C920 has the capability of giving you the very best picture a 720p output can display. If you are having issues, I 100% promise you it is a lighting/settings issue."
"I almost exclusively make my oatmeal (steel cut) in a slow cooker overnight now.

Also, pasta sauce- One large can each of crushed and diced tomatoes, one can of tomato paste, half an onion chopped, 4 cloves of garlic diced, ~7-10 medium basil leaves chopped, then some oregano and thyme (dried, as I don't have plants yet). Add water to preference. Set on low for 7-8 hours. Tasty sauce that lasts me like a week. For extra awesome, add some meatballs."
Bad acid reflux?
Oh dang that’s nice. I much prefer the design of the Spigen so I’ll probably end up going with that. Thanks for the suggestion
"I've been saying this exact statement for years whenever this conversation comes up. Lowes seems more homeowner friendly, more stylish options. HD seems more contractor friendly."
"Thank you, learned something new. Been using axios for a while, but had no idea about the post progress monitoring."
i read somewhere that Micheal Hussey only got his debut after 30. Is that true?
"I feel like I'd have to get/build a brand new PC though. It's definitely an option, I am very tempted... It just seems like a console might be better because I'm always using PC and Mac for my business, so console might feel like more of an escape. 

It all comes down to choice, I think I will explore some controller options, see how they feel etc.. Then I will know a bit more. 

Thanks for your answer!"

Started watching S1 today. There goes my week.
Murali has a bad record in Australia and India but great everywhere else.

Have fun."
