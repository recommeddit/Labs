"Does anyone else feel that reddit should move to a tag based system (e.g. like gmail.com or stackoverflow.com)?

Reddit's community is getting fragmented across multiple subreddits with overlapping content."
"as someone who started freshman year at Cal Poly, I despise having so much major coursework done and still missing GEs to be untranserrable until I take a few semesters of CC"
"Well you gotta think about it like this, BGW is mostly pulling in from the tidewater region and southern Va. KD pulls from Richmond and DC/NoVa which are much more populated and people from there probably donâ€™t wanna drive an extra 1.5 hours just to go to BGW. If this map is based off internet searches, KD is located near more densely populated areas which in turn results in more internet searches.

I hope this makes sense, I tried to not sound too technical."

"from what I remember as a kid.... you open the door & immediately not recognize what the kids are dressed up as because you are so out of touch with child fads/culture.  Then you say something like.... ""ooooo look at all the scary... eh...um... so what are you supposed to be?"" Then when the kids tell you .... you STILL have no idea what they are talking about because you still have never heard of it. Then you stumble about verbally saying something like ""Ooooo how scary!"" then you either give or offer some candy.... typically the crappy hard candy kind. Rarely ever the good chocolate kind. 

When i was a kid I went dressed up as a [Gamorian Guard](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/6/64/Gamorrean-hd.jpg) & not a single person knew what I was. One old bat asked who I was & when i told her.... she said ""oooo a goodmorning Guard"""
"I can't speak for everyone, but for me being left alone isn't about not wanting to be with my family or friends. It's about being free knowing that I don't have to consider in any way what they want to do, what they have planned, what they have in mind, how anything makes them feel, or whether or not they need or want any particular thing at a particular time. I can sleep when I'm sleepy, eat when I'm hungry and not have to think more than 10 minutes into the future unless I really want to.

It's not completely about being alone, it's about being free of consideration and compromise for a day."
What's interesting is that if the chest freezer is closed and the power is cut off; you're gonna need more than 2 days to defrost all the meat. Providing they've been frozen frozen

"If you are looking for a slim  (and still pretty durable) case, which will feel and look good, go for Pitaka MagEZ. There is no comparison. Nevertheless, nothing compares to the feel of a naked phone. As for screen protector, spigen seems to be the best on the market. Spigen protector + apple care is my personal preference."

"So I started making a list, but stopped. It's just too hard, lol. Some of these new found loves are amazing, and I wouldn't want to necessarily exclude them. After sniffing and owning hundreds and hundreds, I think I'm doing 'okay' with around \~95 different scents.  

One thing remains though, Kouros is #1! :)"

"RO is not what is necessary.  Activated carbon is actually effective at removing organics.  

I've posted throughout this thread, but here is a [link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jctb.1087/full) to a paper showing that carbon based filters like the brita remove out organics.

It isn't the ""filtering"" ability of the media that removes the organics, it is the chemical properties associated with the surface that causes them to bind with the surface of the activated carbon, thus removing it."
"I really really liked Sucker Punch, however that probably has to do with the fact that I'm a big gamer/game developer, and imo it would've made a lot more sense as a video game rather than a movie."

"Sometimes I regret buying a nice webcam, a blue yeti and a stand for it when I first started streaming.  I got really into but then it fizzled out. So I sank like 200 right from the start but then didn't stream anymore after a month.


My advice is start cheap. I just now got back into streaming and I still wouldn't go crazy on the gadgets until you are for sure gonna stick to it."
