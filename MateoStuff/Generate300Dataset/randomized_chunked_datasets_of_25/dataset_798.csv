33366,best electric car,"Should probably be in it's own post, but your options for 3-row EVs are currently the Teslas, or waiting a few years for the VW Buzz, Ford Explorer EV or Rivian's thing."
68966,best science fiction novel,"I’ve probably bought it half a dozen times because I want a copy to own but keep giving it away to people who I think would benefit from reading it. I’ve put off reading the sequel, but I just picked up a copy at a used book store a few months ago and I might finally get around to it over the next year or so. I’m sure it won’t be up to par with the original."

10980,best backpack for college,Topo Designs Klettersack. I've been using mine for nearly three years as a student. It's big enough to use for travel but compresses to small enough for nothing but a laptop and a notebook.

70331,best major to study in college,That’s true! The truth is I don’t really know what I want am that makes me very scared as I get closer to graduation.
