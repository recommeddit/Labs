55324,best action and adventure novel series,"I resisted reading Watership Down for years. Afterall, I'm a grown man, why the hell would I read a book about rabbits? 

I was so wrong. What a fantastic read."
2509,best headphones,"if he's going way low budget I love my MDR-V300's. It's an older model, but they fit well on me and the sound quality is good enough for my needs."
55153,best places to hike in the east coast,"I don't think walking in a straight line is a thing in the east or west coasts. My local Search & Rescue (west coast) is always looking for lost or dead people. I'm sure the east coast has the same problem because all it takes is tree cover and someone without a compass. I volunteer with SAR in a county of 50,000 people and we've located 5 bodies this summer alone. 2 in rivers. 3 in forests where they just walk in circles."

27832,best breakfast foods,"In my experience (full disclosure, i'm american), scones are generally sweet?  Am I mistaken about this?

American biscuits are normally savory.   It's basically a type of roll but a little different with a sausage gravy poured on top.  It really is pretty good, as long as you don't mind having your ENTIRE MEAL taste exactly the same, bite for bite."
40228,best midrange CPU,they should also stop testing with medium settings just to create cpu bottleneck at 200+ fps.

4508,best text editor,Really? I'm curious how you found this out...can you share your source?
38240,best newspapers to read,"WaPo is good for staying connected politics wise, but then again they sporadically release incredibly biased pieces.  Politico is the same way, except they seem to go either way sometimes, whereas Wapo is consistently left.

As other people are saying, multiple sources is by far the best.  There are better options, but I generally will read wapo, politico, the times or Reuters, for a more balanced perspective, and then if theres an interesting or controversial story I'll try to find something about it on something egregious like Slate or Breitbart."

24932,best spiderman actor,"I don't like any of them. I know that's a little harsh but I don't think any of them really nailed it. Stated differently, I do not recognize the Peter Parker I know and love from the comics when I watch these guys on screen.

But of the three, I definitely enjoyed Tobey's movies the most. I don't really attribute that to him, though. Sam Raimi is the man."

670,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"1. I use Windscribe, researched it and it is solid. 

2. You can use the search bars on this or the r/piracy sub to search those VPNs for more info any time.

3. You also can research them on torrentfreak.com  They both have outstanding records in court for not keeping user info. If they don't keep records, there's nothing to give law enforcement if they come knocking."
40206,best midrange CPU,$150 for entry level Z490 (which some people on the Intel subreddit argued those boards are inadequate for any serious 10600K OCing) vs a $80 Asrock B450m Pro4 that can run a stock 3900X/3950X or an OC'ed 3900X with extra airflow over VRMs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9_E3h8bLp-TXr-0zTJFqqVxdCR9daIVNyMatydkpFA/edit#gid=611478281
