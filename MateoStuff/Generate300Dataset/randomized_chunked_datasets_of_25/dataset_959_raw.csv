"Is this an established method of ranking? If so, what is it called? I'd love to read about it!"
The latest version of `nnn` has many features which were pending for a while. I've been developing this alone and it took some time to reach here. :)

i was thinking about getting a tsa lock but i kept hearing horror stories about them not opening or the tsa throwing the lock away
"""Energy Gap in Superconductors Measured by Electron Tunneling"", by Ivar Giaever [Phys. Rev. Lett. 5, 147â€“148 (1960)](http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v5/i4/p147_1)

A straightforward experiment showing a phenomenal result:  the existence of an energy gap in superconductors"
This saved me so many hours of confusion! Thank you! So much!
"You read up on US history and I will read up on Australian history. I feel I know a lot about American, European, and Asian history but next to nothing about Australian and Canadian. 

I feel like Australia, the US, and Canada have a lot in common culturally and socially."
"They also make the best vegan pizza in town. If you want to make your own at home, their frozen dough is the best. Keep it in the fridge for a day or two (makes it better) to thaw, let it rise in a greased bowl on the counter, covered for 4-6 hours. They use '00 flour' which is what the great NY pizzerias use. Top that baby, and throw it in a 500 degree oven for 13 minutes (pizza stone best) ...best pizza in town."
A straightforward and mostly accurate analogy to answer your second question: the Daily Mail is to print journalism what Fox News is to broadcast journalism. Except with lots more near-naked teenagers on the Mail's website.
"Washington State: Olympic National Park.

Washington has a lot of destinations and some iconic places but it's hard to beat the diversity of beautiful nature in ONP."
Canticle is one of my favorite books Iâ€™ve read in the past two years!  I know some people find it dry but I find itâ€™s descriptions fantastic.
My mom loves to make quilts and sew. I remember her saying one time how her mom used to make their dresses out of flour sacks theyâ€™d buy at the general store (flour was sold in decorative cotton sacks at the time). I found a bunch of old flour sacks on eBay along with an old quilting book. She loved it.
Do you or u/theCrownedRoyal have any good spotify hardstyle playlists? I'm trying to get into hardstyle and I'm having trouble figuring out what tracks to look for
You're telling me
Awesome! I don't know your exact situation/challenges but if I had to give a blind recommendation to read just one book on productivity it would definitely be David Allen's *Getting Things Done (#18* on the full list)!
"On paper, it's very strange when it happens. There's an established field of play, but players can impact that field of play while being outside of it. 

Even stranger is that on kick-off/punt plays if a defender goes out of bounds they have to quickly get back in bounds or they get a penalty. On offense, players that go out of bounds can't be the first to touch the ball (unless they were forced out by a defender I think). 

There's definitely something that doesn't feel right with it, but there's so many rules favoring the offense and that this is relatively rare that I think it's fine."
"He is me and I am you. I know it was from a movie but it still is the best video I have ever seen.

Pros: I adore programming and the creative and logical aspects.
Cons: Women in CS tend to be less respected."
"I did that for her Mother's day... her reply was ""Why is the stone blue?""    ""It's aquamarine.""  *blank look*  ""Our... son's... birthstone?"" ""Ohhhhhhh""

Wives, amiright?"
"From Ohio, we were taught that the land of North Mexico at that time was more advantageous for railroad construction so we moved to take that land.  I don't recall them trying to paint us as the good guys"

"There's a massive amount of ""growing up"" that happens between the ages of 15-20. Once I was a few years into adulthood, I started appreciating just how great my parents were. Now that I have kids, I'm astounded they accomplished what they did."
"I highly doubt it will be top 5 for many people. Not a knock against it, just there's a ton of great movies and origin stories are slower. I imagine Infinity War, End Game, Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Iron Man 1, Guardians, and Spiderman will all be ranked higher on the majority of lists.

Again, I loved the movie but no way it's a top 5. Good competition"
