"I stumbled on him the other day and binged most of the videos


The [Dyatlov Pass one](https://youtu.be/Y8RigxxiilI) was my personal favourite just because it's so bizarre the way they were found and I'd never heard the story before"
"If being able to use magic (that isn't even magic) means RPG to you, I just don't know what to tell you. And if having a leveling system means RPG, then Minecraft is an RPG.

Minecraft is not an RPG. Spoiler alert.

I'm not gonna bother with ""Is HZD an RPG or not"" nonsense as the term ""RPG"" is one the most vague things, and I don't own the game and so I don't care, but your points, if you can even call them that, flat out suck. Especially multiple weapons? What? So COD is an RPG now? Please just stop."
"Which hotel? How many points do you have? I assume you are top tier status, what perks do you get?"
"The thing about truck buyers though is that doesn't matter to a huge base of the customers. They buy the brand not the vehicle.

It doesn't matter that Ramis late to the party. They have a garunteed consumer base that wants the brand and a potential consumer base of anyone who gets burned by the inevitable teething issues electric will have. Once those are sorted out, ram spends a fraction of the cost gm and Ford did building the same truck they offer."

Is there any way to know whether a seller on eBay is selling Otsu v2 or v1?
"Salman Khan.. is a straightforward, too no political correct person sometimes,  very secure he doesnt care about low high   press praise image .. carefree and self-deprecating. He likes to play big brother to member of his family, friends, struggling actors, poor, ex gfs, outsider in general but you have to be loyal to him if not he writes you off you don't exist for him.

Srk.. He s charming and witty and uses  words in his favor he knows how to speak  .. There was a time where he felt invincible almost a God arrogant.. but failure take a toll on him lately.. He will comes back he s a good businessman.. He knows how to sell his image

Aishwarya.. She was labelled an ice maiden. She s. Very diplomatic and sometimes pompous and too perfect in public but I think with friends family she s very warm caring straightforward. A traditional Indian girl

Katrina kaif she s hardworking  a diplomatic person not too confrontational  she tried to mantein peaceful and good relationship with everyone in bw.. She can be sometimes moody but she s a sweet nice girl at heart..in search of love.. I hope this time she found it.. 

Akshay kumar he's hardworking and a warm person consistent in his last years..  he trys to portray an image of family man but we know he s a playpoy at heart sometimes too touchy Feely with his female costars.. I don't like his political association recently at all... stay out of it akki... Please


Amir khan is a perfectionist he s one of the few actor in bw who can do good commercial and content films.  He portray himself as an intellectual but sometimes lack substance

Ranbir k is a detached polite and talented guy he has a good sense of humor and he can be charming

Ranveer very versatile actor a warm intelligent and hardworking guy.. Just too attention seeking sometimes..he's more strategic than one can think of

Ajaj devgn brilliant versatile actor I like his sense of humor he seems a good father but as an husband well noooo words but if kajol is happy.. Well good for her

Amitabh so talented so popular  and so insecure.. too much.. he needs to be constantly reassured and to be considered.. 

Hritik r.. He s  handsome  great dancer  but can be a decent actor too.. He could be at khans level where stardom is concerned but he s worried. too much about numbers and failure so he is hesitant

Sushmita sen..not a great actress or too succesful not too interested in it too.. but  My favourite in bw.. carefree independent intelligent she lives her life at full at her own terms  .. Ahead of her time 

Preity zinta I like her she was a decent actress and I like her friendly  loyal and bubbly personality and her courage to testimony against underworld like no other actors  in bw and she filed a case against  his ex who was a member of a rich and powerful family for molestation.. Respect"
"My husband asked for a wallet for Father's Day. I'm going to let my 3 year old pick it out. It's going to be hilarious, I suspect. 

...I'll save the receipt."
That sounds good I should try that next chance I have
"There's a lot of yellow in antique white, so it works well with warm tones, but try a cool blue and it'll look terrible."
"30% of France lives in Paris, so all their best schools are also on top of each other and are shown with only one dot. A heatmap would have been better I imagine."
Can confirm. Was gifted an electric toothbrush and have been teeth ever since. Gums still send me holiday cards.

"We were looking into Mexico, and from what we've been seeing so far it seems to fit our needs the best (so far of course).  Any resorts in particular?"
It’s mad that they think Poland is the 19th best international team in the world. Every time I watch us play it’s like a Sunday league team with 1 good player up top. Madness.
"LGR/Lazy Game Reviews - retro technology, video games, interesting stories from the history of tech. I'm not a big fan of most YouTube 'personalities' but LGR seems like a genuinely nice dude who is very knowledgeable about history of computers/video games/etc. I'm not even a ""gamer"" but love watching all his videos."
Fruli is seriously fucking amazing!
"Ringworld is one of my most memorized Scf-Fi books.  The Puppeteers, the ring world itself... I was just at that age where I was in awe of the mental imagery and the book consumed me.  

I guess the list depends on the judging criteria.  I am more shocked that nothing from Asimov made the list.  It's really difficult to take a large genre and create a ""top X"" list.  Undoubtedly, there will be great works excluded (but not diminished) by generating a small list."
"Just be aware that they can eat up your apple pencil tips, so make sure to have a replacements (I removed my matte screen protector. That was one of the reasons among others.). IMO, it's best without protection :)"
