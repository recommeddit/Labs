60356,Best comedy show on Netflix,Hulu I think. I think I have it on my watch list if I'm not badly mistaken.
53496,best medicine for a cold,"Honestly, weed. It boosts your white blood cell count, which while I'm no expert in the medical field, I do believe is beneficial to combating illness. Beyond that, it's pretty effective at masking just about any symptom - no more nauseousness, headaches, cramps, etc."
41409,best instrument to play,You literally just made my point for me
7637,best laptop for general use,"ASUS typically includes a dongle for 3.5mm audio, but it seems like they don't with that particular configuration.

What issues in particular? My experience with Zenbooks in the past has been relatively positive. 

You could also try finding the newer Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen Intel on sale. At the normal pricing, it isn't typically a great value but sometimes Dell has promotions."
6024,best programming language for web development,"If you want to become a web developer you need to learn Java, PHP, Python and .Net.."
14654,best romantic novel,Thanks everyone for the wonderful suggestions today! This was fun and I now have the longest TBR ever. I hope it was helpful for others as well ðŸ’œðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰
24133,best anime,"No order:

* Steins;Gate
* Cowboy Bebop
* Trigun
* Black Lagoon
* Mirrai Nikki (Future Diary)

Honorable mentions:

* Ouran HS Host Club

3192,best webcamera,"New streamer here. I use the Logitech C922. It's $99, and honestly worth every penny in my personal opinion. I even tried it with a green screen and a chroma filter and the image quality is crispy and very high quality. Great starter camera."
35441,best alcoholic drink,"Papo Js Lambanog Vodka, coconut water, and cold brew coffee on the rocks."
9421,best toothpaste,"Dentist in Australia. I have both Colgate and Oral B in my bathroom right now, because both of them send me free samples. Which one do I use? Colgate total is my preferred toothpaste, mainly because of the triclosan and co-polymer that keeps it active for 12 hours. I use Oral B when colgate runs out because I'm not sure if the difference is worth going out to buy a tube of colgate when I know I'll get a free one in a month or so.

With regards to toothbrush, I received an oral B electric toothbrush in 1st and 5th year of dental school. The one from first year broke 2 years out, which is when I cracked open the second one. Only seen the colgate toothbrush at trade shows but from hearing from other dentists who have used it, it doesn't work as well nor is it as comfortable.

TLDR; colgate total toothpaste, oral b toothbrush."
7759,best laptop for general use,"Hey guys, decided to shop around for a laptop for just grad school. Looking at the 400-600 tier on the list, any suggestions? Donâ€™t really know too much about current laptops as Iâ€™ve always worked on my PC"
30747,best country to live in,"Unitl you've walked a mile in my shoes, your opinion doesn't make a pound of difference to any degree."
37866,best Marvel movie,"Idk where you got ""top 5 for most people"" lol, ofc this sub is gonna have it being rated really high, we're biased asf for any new movie/show that comes out, but I wouldn't wager that *Most people* have it top 5.

Loved the movie, it was fucking great, but when BW and TFatWS came out, a big collective of this sub was rating those as top-tier, best MCU projects ever. Time has definitely changed that and now most people wouldn't include those in top 15, even top 20 lol"
59470,best perfume,"Good topic, but a tall task.

I'll get to work, see if I can narrow my favorites down to 20."
