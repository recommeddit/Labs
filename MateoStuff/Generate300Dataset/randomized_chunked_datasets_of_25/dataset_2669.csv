  I was always disappointed when we finally got to a house with twix or whatever favorite of mine I was lacking in that night and THEN they would hand me candy that I didn't want as much. I was obviously still happy, because it's candy. But it was still disappointing. =[   
  
  
  Also everyone has mentioned turning on your porch light. Where I grew up it was normal for people to sit on their porches are driveways. Some people are saying that it's creepy to watch the kids walk up to your house, but I always thought Halloween was kind of like a parade. It's fun watching all the kids run around the neighborhood dressed up! I guess you could wait and see if other neighbors are doing the same, before you decide whether to sit outside or not.   
  
  
  Most people won't be upset if you run out of candy, just turn your porch light off, maybe write a note on the door that says sorry (with a sad face, so they know you're sincere) Have fun! =]",best trick or treating candy

Then, when you're hit with a cold, refuse to take anything for it except maybe some orange juice, and *convince* yourself that your bad-ass immune system is throwing the table at your infection. I haven't had a serious cold in the last ten years, and what colds I've had were hardly an inconvenience.",best medicine for a cold

26590,"So I had played Pandemic once before, and my boyfriend and our friend had never played it, when we got Legacy. We played vanilla pandemic using the Legacy game (just ignoring the extra components) until we won a game, then we moved onto the Legacy stuff. I think that’s the best way to do it, because you do want to understand the game well before starting your Legacy journey since mistakes in early games can have consequences on all subsequent games. It’s a fun experience for sure though. 

Some of the games I’ve found to be Catan-like are Terraforming Mars and Agricola, maybe Castles of Burgundy as well. These are all notably more complicated to learn, but give a deeper experience as you aren’t entirely at the mercy of dice rolls and can plan your actions more meaningfully. I’ve also heard Caverna and A Feast for Odin are similar/just as good as Agricola. Basically, they all revolve around building your colony/settlement/estate by strategically acquiring resources or resource producers",best board games
