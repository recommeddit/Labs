">  Let me know if I screwed anything up, because I probably did.

It's pretty distrubing that I can't find any mistakes"
CGA BEATS DISNEYLAND LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Oh man, I'll read that right after I finish rereading my favorite sci-fi space epic Hyperion!"
Breakfast pizza. Sausage gravy as a base. Scrambled eggs. Bacon. Hash browns and of course...cheese.
It's a silent alarm.  We wire up the device inside of a mailpiece so that it will go from beacon mode into alarm mode (audible on our radios) upon opening.
"OP, so that you know, you mention uncle Bob's ""[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)"", but your link redirects to the book ""Clean Code**r**"". They're both great, but different.

I've ordered the book [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962). Looks great to brush up the basics of statistics and machine learning. Since I haven't actually read it yet, take my input with a grain of salt."
"I just watched the SU&SD review for terraforming Mars. They weren’t too terribly kind and their complaints seemed reasonable. On this list that game was \#2, could anyone drop some positives about the game to help me understand what makes it so great or why SU&SD was off the mark?"
I am bit surprised at the number of people who rated Akshay higher than SRK on acting ability
"[BEST of Japanese Bug Fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNg5a3GnvaE) 

I used to watch this kind of stuff rather than sleep. Believe it or not, lack of sleep can have a serious impact on your brain."
"Because you're supposed to go to the dentist twice a year or once a year (depending on where you're from) anyway. So they're still getting paid.

I'd also like to see people apply this logic to other doctors. ""My cardiologist gets paid for me having a bad heart so why should I take these lifesaving meds!""

Plus most people still aren't flossing. Brushing only does so much, you still have tons of decaying food in between your teeth."

"If you want to try german rap, there are these two guys Kollegah and Farid Bang. They say they make music to lift hard!  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jv5u-98w4g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jv5u-98w4g) for example!

Check out their collaboration albums JBG 1-3 ;)"
HAIIIRRRR CUUUTTTT
"In my experience, the 5700 XT is an *infuriating* card and I can't recommend it. I have done a fresh install of every single driver and 19.12.1 is still the only one that works. Everything since then crashes every few hours, even while watching Netflix."
"Well, I went into it spoiled so I wasn't looking for a big twist or anything. I knew what the destination was, I was just enjoying the journey there."

Go for Ben 2580q it's crazy good
Nah Pennsylvania is spot on
Ketchapp and voodoo are the same for me but if I had to choose yeah voodoo is worse. Nitrome is alright but not my type of games
Seriously. Hike at your peril after late October.
LF. Looks like ranger but much better imo
"On the subject of pirate movies, Cutthroat Island"
Any WR who played before the ”player protection” era is better than today's WRs. It's just a fact if a guy can still make catches and get blown up going over the middle they are a better football player.
">Just make it last

Believe it or not the idea of getting the right amount is giving me anxiety attacks. I want to get enough for kids, but not so much that I'll continue eating the candy for weeks.  

Thanks for your advice!"
