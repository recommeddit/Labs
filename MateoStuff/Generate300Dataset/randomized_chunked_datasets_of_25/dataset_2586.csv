13686,best research paper archive,"For finding free, full-text research articles, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is your friend. Just type in whatever you're looking for, and voila - you've got thousands of hits of fascinating articles on your topic of interest. Most of the results will be citations only, but you'd be surprised how many returns will include pdf's for the whole article. Here's how to find them:

1. While still on Google Scholar, look at the line of small print in blue at the bottom of each search result listing. Many of the articles have a link to ""All 5 versions"" (or however many). Click that link and a page will come up showing all the places listing that article. Often one or more of those places will say PDF or html. Those are generally the free, full-text versions you want. 

2. If Google Scholar doesn't have full-text of the article you want, you might still be able to find it elsewhere. Copy a key part of the article's title onto your clipboard and go over to regular Google. Type in filetype:pdf then paste your title snippet. You can further narrow the results by putting quotation marks around the title. This will find any non-academic sites that might carry your article.

That's the fastest and easiest way I know to get a lot of free, full-text articles. There are plenty of other free databases as well, each carrying different amounts of full-text versions. Here's a listing of some of the free databases I've found. Most are oriented toward medicine and the social sciences, with several databases for the hard sciences as well. I found some of them through [Wikipedia's list of academic databases and search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines). You can do web searches for free databases in your particular field to find others.

68742,best science fiction novel,"Wow. Someone else that thinks Enders Game is terrible. I know it's sacrilege to say that book sucks in the SF community. But, I read it after I learned about Orson Scott Card's hatred for homosexuals, and his participation in programs that try to ""de-gay"" people. (Btw there a lot of super gay scenes in the book). Author's evangelical views aside, the book alone is insanely overrated. Maybe if I read it when I was 12, I'd hold it dear to my heart like so many SF fans do. Guess I missed my window.

Sorry. That's just my asshole opinion. I was just glad to see I'm not the only one who thought it was awful."

My dad has done maintenance and carpentry my whole life, so I got him a plain grey and black toolbox when I was around 10 years old. Fast forward to 2005 and Hurricane Katrina floods my entire home town. The only thing my dad was interested in salvaging was that toolbox. He found it, cleaned it out, and still uses it to this very day. I got him a good gift."
