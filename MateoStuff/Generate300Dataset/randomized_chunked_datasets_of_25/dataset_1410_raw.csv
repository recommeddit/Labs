"Low cost?
Monoprice has surprised me with their quality / cost ratio.  Consider these:

"Thanks for the suggestion, I’ve had it and didn’t care for it."
As long as it helps you get through your workout I ain't gonna judge.
"What's the best sub $500 laptop out right now? Friend is looking for one just to watch shows, browse, and do minor office work."
"I believe it. It was high school. We all did, said and tried stupid things, just remember it's not his fault you're missing out on some Sensodynamite blow jobs."
"Witcher 3

Diablo III"

"Yes. Those begin with 795. GE(464)Maytag, Samsung, amana, and daewoo(110) as well. Can’t remember all of the model numbers. Worked for Sears home services for quite a few years."
"Plenty of rankings I find baffling (less than 10% of the top 100 includes wooden coasters which is a crime, as is Batman being around 200 simply because it's been cloned).

Still interesting to see though. Now let's do a ""quality over quantity"" where parks with at least 3 coasters are ranked based on the average spot each coaster landed. I have a feeling BGT, BGW, SWO, Holiday World, SDC, and a few of the smaller parks will receive a lot more love on a list like that."
"I find a lot of MUSE songs really build and build and you end up powering through a great cardio workout! (resistance, invincible, uprising, starlight, plug in baby, feeling good). Also.....Britney, Rihanna and Shakira never let me down! Liking the Mixerbox app but eating my data....damn gym doesn't even know their own wifi password!!!"
"You can find some, but it's really hit or miss depending on what you're looking for. I ended up buying access to someone's scribd account on eBay. $5 for 2 years of access."
"To be honest, there is an argument for Rice being more dominant than Gretzky. 

Gretzky was a monster, but his extremely high numbers are partly a product of playing in the 1980s when NHL scoring was at an all-time high. If you adjust for era Gretzky is still number one in points, but a couple players have more era adjusted goals. 

You can argue that Lemieux had just as much, if not more, pure talent (and dealt with serious injuries and a lesser supporting cast). You can argue Gordie Howe was the more complete player. You can argue Bobby Orr was more peerless as a defenseman than Gretzky was as a center. 

I really don't think any receiver is in the stratosphere of Rice with the possible exception of Don Hutson (and that's such a different era it's kind of impossible to compare)."

"I currently use a Xiaomi powerbank, was previously using an Anker one. The Anker one is older and larger, but while in use, never gave me any issues. I'd recommend either one."
"A really good, sturdy can opener."
Not that I'd recommend it but the other day I accidently took too much cold medicine and went a little crazy but damn if it didn't cure my cold
"Oh when I say performance I mean like long term, like Ace rub is supposed to live 120 years or so, so if it dies in the first 50 years means failure to me."
"Security guard here. I’ve cracked two locks at work that the client desperately needed into thanks to a basic picking set and his videos. 

It’s shocking to me that major corps routinely lose keys with zero backups."
"Flavored vodka and club soda.

No extra sugar, keeps you relatively hydrated, and you can reach for the lower shelf booze if your wallet isn't too full.

Of course if you are not a vodka drinker, I would suggest any other hard liquor with (again) club soda. Things like tonic water, on, and Redbull are loaded with HFCS in most bars.

Hang drum.
"I would highly suggest getting an 11 if you can within the budget. Yes, the Xr is a great phone but at the same time it is heading towards 3 years old."
"I tend to stick on a jungle mix, like Ronnie size or something"
