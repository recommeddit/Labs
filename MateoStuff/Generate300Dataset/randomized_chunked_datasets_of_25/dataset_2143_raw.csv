Very informative!!!Thanks
Because you have mid. Try soft or xsoft for zero and you'll notice the speed is reduced a good amount. Mid is only good on Raiden and shidenkai IMO cause those are built to be fast.

"Lies of Locke Lamora hits most of these notes and is absolutely wonderful. The only thing I would say is that it does not much focus on the beauty that can be in the routine or mundane (referring to the line about the day to day). The pace is all wrong for that, as it zips through fairly active plotting. It's got everything else you mention in spades though. Even swashbuckling. Especially swashbuckling."

"Fried eggs on toast, with bacon or sausage and maybe hash browns. Biscuits and gravy. Pancakes. Oatmeal (old fashioned oats 4evah). Waffles with strawberries and whipped cream (in season, which means now!). These are what I'm likely to make any given weekend day. Sometimes I'll do omelettes or benedict or cinnamon rolls but that's rarer. Weekdays we eat cereal (hot or cold, but probably not oatmeal because time), yogurt, bagels, fruits, or fried eggs on toast (no bacon or hash browns because time)."
"> There are tons of RPGs that more or less ignore story and just focus on a good dungeon crawl. The souls games fit into that category.

Those aren't RPGs then, since there's no 'role playing' to be found. Those are action games. The Diablo series falls into that genre as well."

"I got a 2ml sample of vintage Halston from surrender to chance! It's green and floral, just a touch sweet. It reminded me of aromatics elixir. I got a lot of vetiver in the drydown, which I liked a lot."
"Nicee man like the different opinions, not arguing at all i love talking hip hop so when you say those two are more artistically ambitious then anything before what about them makes you say that?"
