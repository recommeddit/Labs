Man a lot of people give him a bad rep for the drug abuse (especially my mother) but he just comes off in interviews as a genuinely nice and happy guy. I'm glad to hear a story about him that doesn't involve him being a terrible person for doing heroin. We all have our bad days and RDJ certainly has been through a lot of shit and beat it...
"I agree 100%. Violence and fury concentrated into a single being so densely, there's nothing you can do about it."
yes it does
My guess is that somewhere along the Riviera Maya would be your best bet. I was going to send you a sales pitch but we definitely don't cater to the jet ski crowd :)
"Really really cheap vodka mixed with diet soda.

Get blasted for 3 bucks.

I combine my frugality with my shocking alcoholism."
Thanks so much for this!
"You may enjoy John Lewis Gaddis' ""The Cold War: A New History."" The beginning chapters show that the tension between the two armies was present long before the end of the war, and the author's thesis about the importance of ""ordinary people"" over political leaders in terms of influence is very intriguing.

Of course, it wasn't always like that. If you're interested in the military side of things, the prolific historian John Keegan's ""Six Armies at Normandy"" shows that it was actually American and Soviet leaders who agreed the most on strategy, with Britain usually being the odd one out. The narratives Keegan gives in that book are really powerful, particularly the daring parachute drop before Normandy."
"Donâ€™t forget GM will offer Chevy EV truck in the future. Itâ€™s supposed to be cheaper Hummer. 

What I see, GM is really serious in their EV effort. Theyâ€™re creating the battery factory and working in many EV models. Their typical bureaucracy seems not affecting their program. 

Of course, I agree with you about the early quality and risk taking. The Corvette C8 is a good example."
Maximum strength Sudafed is the only thing that works for me.
haha I know right I had a poster of it. Still back in the day I bet it was a great moment if you didn't know
I have the TI N-spire and I have nothing bad to say about it!
Siri is trash right now with years of updates. With the 4S it was just a gimmick.
"Yesterworld is also one I really enjoy, not as high production as Defunctland, but he goes into attraction and theme park history and why something was or was not built, I really appreciate the research done on those types of videos."
We are having a walnut floor installed.

"They're not bad. But can they stand up against the likes of Reese Pieces, Snickers, Almond Joy, and 100 Grand?"
"Thank fucking god someone explained it, haha"
Youâ€™re welcome!! & right now you should be able to get the lotion for free with any EDP purchase too ðŸ˜‰
"I occasionally will drink a red bull during a long car ride, but I typically prefer coffee."
I just got a sample of Prada Candy and it smells so goood !

Yeah, they really shine."
Tobey by far.
"It really depends on what time of year you are going and what you want out of the football game. Better teams are going to offer a more exciting atmosphere (with some exceptions...) but the tickets will be more expensive and harder to get. Weather is also a factor here. If you want to knock out a few really cool cities in a row, I would suggest traveling from Boston down to DC. There are plenty of travel options here, and many great football teams along the way (mostly pro). The farther south you go the better BBQ you will find (even though I have had amazing BBQ in DC), however the locations are going to be more spread out. I have been to many games (both college and pro) so let me know if you have any questions."
Feige also stated the women were his favorite part of the movie.
