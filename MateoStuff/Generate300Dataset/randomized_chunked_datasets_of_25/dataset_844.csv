70350,best major to study in college,"I would say majoring sociology and then go to law school.

I decided against it because of the supply and demand.

A public defender only gets paid sub par and it's quite a righteous occupation, but I decided against it once again.

So I decided to Major in Biology and go to medical school. There will always be a demand for doctors and especially nowadays with this pandemic, COVID-19.

This really motivated me to help others and let them go on their way. If I can take their sicknesses I would, but all I can do is give my best!

I will be graduating this semester, Spring 2021 and will got to medical school after a gap year on Fall 2022. I will be taking a lab researching role and will study with the MCAT in the mean time."
