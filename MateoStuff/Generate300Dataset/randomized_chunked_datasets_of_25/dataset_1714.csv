44371,best items under $100,"Common mistake. If you slowly move the brush over your teeth and let it do all the work it will do wonders. (think of it as mowing a tiny lawn) Since I started using an electric toothbrush 10 years ago I have had zero cavities and the hygienist always complements me on my brushing and flossing.

I never fucking floss.


**EDIT:** jeebus, 332 upvotes for *this*? Clarifications/answers - I have an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. I do floss when there is shit stuck between my teeth or I think I need to. I am nearly 50 years old. Also regarding the heredity comment - yes! My wife's family has teeth like fucking diamonds and they do not know what a cavity is. Mine are like balsa wood in comparison."

66007,best college in california,Santa Barbara is now a better school than San Diego? Interesting. I always viewed UCSD as having a solid grip on their 3rd place in the UC rankings.

5040,best home improvement store,"Yeah, former dept managers had to apply to become area (it might be zone managers) managers and have about 5 dept under their supervision (and those that didn’t get the positions were fired) All installed sales, HR management and similar positions were eliminated and they got a customer service line in some state that takes all calls and deals with installations and complaints. 

And then again, some of the people have been there way too long and have had to deal with customers that make you wish you could drink some bleach for breakfast."

70414,best major to study in college,"I'm in comp sci and I sort of wish I went into **Geology**. I'm in my junior year, and I did the math and it would still be possible for me to switch majors and finish on time (while picking up a minor in CS from the courses I've already taken). I'd have to switch now, though, and I've taken too many of the hard CS classes to justify it.

I'd love to be a ""proper"" natural scientist.

Maybe a psych or philosophy minor as well. I'm not too torn up with CS, though, since I'm almost finished and it can open up even non-tech-related doors."
