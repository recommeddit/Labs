44371,"Common mistake. If you slowly move the brush over your teeth and let it do all the work it will do wonders. (think of it as mowing a tiny lawn) Since I started using an electric toothbrush 10 years ago I have had zero cavities and the hygienist always complements me on my brushing and flossing.

I never fucking floss.


**EDIT:** jeebus, 332 upvotes for *this*? Clarifications/answers - I have an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. I do floss when there is shit stuck between my teeth or I think I need to. I am nearly 50 years old. Also regarding the heredity comment - yes! My wife's family has teeth like fucking diamonds and they do not know what a cavity is. Mine are like balsa wood in comparison.",best items under $100

I'm in my junior year, and I did the math and it would still be possible for me to switch majors and finish on time (while picking up a minor in CS from the courses I've already taken). I'd have to switch now, though, and I've taken too many of the hard CS classes to justify it.

I'd love to be a ""proper"" natural scientist.

Maybe a psych or philosophy minor as well. I'm not too torn up with CS, though, since I'm almost finished and it can open up even non-tech-related doors.",best major to study in college
