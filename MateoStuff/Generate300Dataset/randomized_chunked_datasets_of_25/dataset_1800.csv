47183,best state to visit in the United States,Nebraska! We have corn!
42614,best detective show,"Twin Peaks is great. It's so hard to get anybody to watch it though since it's so old.

I'd also recommend Jack Taylor and I think Bloodlines could fit in this category too.

Also, Supernatural could be considered a detective show too and it is far better than any CW show has a right to be. I expected to hate it, but I'm on season 5 now and it's still all good so far."

Use some heavy duty heat shrink with the adhesive in it to heatshrink the pulls, but leave some room toward the zipper head that you could slide a small lock through. 

Should be strong enough that they would cut your bag to get inside, or just ""pen"" open the zipper."
