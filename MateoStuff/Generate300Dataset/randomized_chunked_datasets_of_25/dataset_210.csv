72634,"Hahaha totally fair, I go back and forth on it. Aesthetic is a very subjective category. My experience with it was just that it was too small for my hand and like I said, I was annoyed that the infinity skins weren’t more functional but probably more annoyed at myself for buying a mouse that was way too small for my hand. At this point I’m just kind of making a meme of it. Like I said, def a good addition to the market for people with small hands.",best wireless lightweight mouse

8689,"Stannous fluoride has been used in prescription mouth rinses for years for patients who have had gum or oral surgeries to reduce the bacteria for better healing short-term.  Stannous fluoride is derived from a metal and it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only prevents decay, but it also kills bacteria.  It has only popped up in OTC TPS in the last several years.  The problem with Stannous fluoride is that it is very irritating to the gums and surrounding tissues with long-term use.  As a hygienist I was shocked to see this added to toothpastes for this reason.  Indeed, I’ve had countless patients come to see me with burning, sloughing gums from using it.  
I would only recommend these formulas for short-term use after surgical deep root cleanings.  Crest Pro Health, Paradontax and one of the Sensodyne brands all contain Stannous fluoride and should be used with caution.",best toothpaste
12163,"It's because (to a lot of people at least) part of the point of a gift is to prove that you understand the recipient enough to get them something that they really want without talking to them about it first. It's a test of closeness and understanding. Giving cash is just saying ""I refuse to participate in your ritual"". And opting out of social rituals is always off-putting to participants.",best gifts for dad

40413,For 400$ *Canadian* I'd recommend either a 1660 super/ti or Rx 5600 xt. The 5600 xt being the better performer but the drivers aren't as good/reliable as nvidia's.

22210,"Dolly Parton (on a plane) was great. Genuinely beautiful. Believe it or not, Billy Ray Cyrus was the nicest, politest guy in the world when I did a closing he was involved in in the 90s. I did some work for contemporary Christian artists (Stephen Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith) and they were as nice as you would expect. Steve Earle was the shit. Pretty much if you meet a country artist you will think they are great. You may have guessed I lived in Nashville for a while.

My all time favorite though was Sir Charles Barkley. I was on an elevator at the SEC basketball tournament where he was doing color. He got on and saw my Ole Miss hat. He said ""Ole Miss, huh? I remember they used to wave pizza boxes at me when I shot free throws. I thought that shit was funny.""",best celebrity

There was 1 or 2 spots where I dropped to H+ but otherwise it was pretty good.",best phone service company
