22844,best celebrity,"""I must admit I didn't think much of fultron first time I laid eyes on his comment; looked like a stiff quote would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. """
72634,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Hahaha totally fair, I go back and forth on it. Aesthetic is a very subjective category. My experience with it was just that it was too small for my hand and like I said, I was annoyed that the infinity skins weren’t more functional but probably more annoyed at myself for buying a mouse that was way too small for my hand. At this point I’m just kind of making a meme of it. Like I said, def a good addition to the market for people with small hands."

9736,best dorm hall at UCSB,"[Really shitty map](http://imgur.com/QcXLM3S)

Red = shorties (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz)

Blue = towers (San nic and San mig)

Purple = manzanita and san raf (they house transfers too, unlike the chi-5 which are only freshmen)

and yeah FT is over...there

Edit: Green are the dining halls, figured I'd include them too."
22854,best celebrity,TIL you broke Ringo's heart.
29429,best game console,"1. Final Fantasy Tactics (PS1)
2. Final Fantasy VI (SNES)
3. Ace Combat Zero (PS2)
4. Warhammer 40k: Space Marine (PS3)
5. Halo: Reach (XBOX 360)"
18027,best Kardashian,"You're so right about Kendall, like the whole Pepsi thing and the ""I don't walk like 30 shows a day, that's not the type of model I am"" - all her apologies just come across as really insincere because it's obvious that she's not very self-aware and that she's not really taking the steps to become more self-aware."
44841,best items under $100,Good windshield wipers.  Won't do without.
63818,best books for building better habits reddit,"Awesome thanks man. If I wanted to shoot for a lower goal to start, say approach 3 girls a day for the next two weeks, do you think that would help or should I set a bigger goal as you mentioned?"
70560,best major to study in college,Really? How? Wouldn't I need grad school for cyber security? Would they seriously take my undergrad psych degree?
35916,best alcoholic drink,Maker's on the rocks. Done.
71282,best movies with a cool twist,"Agreed, that film still creeps me out."
8689,best toothpaste,"Stannous fluoride has been used in prescription mouth rinses for years for patients who have had gum or oral surgeries to reduce the bacteria for better healing short-term.  Stannous fluoride is derived from a metal and it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only prevents decay, but it also kills bacteria.  It has only popped up in OTC TPS in the last several years.  The problem with Stannous fluoride is that it is very irritating to the gums and surrounding tissues with long-term use.  As a hygienist I was shocked to see this added to toothpastes for this reason.  Indeed, I’ve had countless patients come to see me with burning, sloughing gums from using it.  
I would only recommend these formulas for short-term use after surgical deep root cleanings.  Crest Pro Health, Paradontax and one of the Sensodyne brands all contain Stannous fluoride and should be used with caution."
12163,best gifts for dad,"It's because (to a lot of people at least) part of the point of a gift is to prove that you understand the recipient enough to get them something that they really want without talking to them about it first. It's a test of closeness and understanding. Giving cash is just saying ""I refuse to participate in your ritual"". And opting out of social rituals is always off-putting to participants."
67912,best science fiction novel,"It's one of those books that moves from simply being a sci-fi novel to being sci-fi literature.  Clever, thought-provoking, and brilliantly aware of both the world it lives in, and the world it's writing to.

That said, I haven't read the Endymion books yet."
15726,best sunglasses for fashion,[the Bespoke Dudes](https://www.thebespokedudeseyewear.com/en/)
31508,best hotel to live in,"Yeah, there’s a few travel agencies you can book through too, I think the one we used was Purely Maldives. You get a much better deal (full board vs half board for the same price) using an agency vs Booking.com or booking direct. It’s a pretty amazing experience."
51153,best rap album,"Considering there are no Black Sabbath albums on this list, there is really no reason to talk about it."
45319,best gaming system,Would be mostly for the kid for sure.
40413,best midrange GPU,For 400$ *Canadian* I'd recommend either a 1660 super/ti or Rx 5600 xt. The 5600 xt being the better performer but the drivers aren't as good/reliable as nvidia's. You *can* find sales on the 2060 which are around 400$ (Amazon prime days is soon so) and theirs always the used market where you might be able to nab a Rx 5700.(an xt if you're lucky)
29986,best money managing app,Lol. I never said that. I do what I can to minimize my exposure to ads though. For everything there’s a trade off and some are worth it while others are not. Everyone has their own limits
72017,best movies with a cool twist,The Exam is pretty awesome.
70327,best major to study in college,i have absolutely zero patience with anything now just because im so involved with dumb politics
22210,best celebrity,"Dolly Parton (on a plane) was great. Genuinely beautiful. Believe it or not, Billy Ray Cyrus was the nicest, politest guy in the world when I did a closing he was involved in in the 90s. I did some work for contemporary Christian artists (Stephen Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith) and they were as nice as you would expect. Steve Earle was the shit. Pretty much if you meet a country artist you will think they are great. You may have guessed I lived in Nashville for a while.

My all time favorite though was Sir Charles Barkley. I was on an elevator at the SEC basketball tournament where he was doing color. He got on and saw my Ole Miss hat. He said ""Ole Miss, huh? I remember they used to wave pizza boxes at me when I shot free throws. I thought that shit was funny."""
65690,best phone service company,"Definitely not as bad unless you enter Tampa!  Even T-Mobile can choke there sometimes, but not as often as Sprint or Verizon.  I visited SF last year and T-Mobile performed admirably, despite what every single person on this forum told me, saying my phone would be unusable.  There was 1 or 2 spots where I dropped to H+ but otherwise it was pretty good."
