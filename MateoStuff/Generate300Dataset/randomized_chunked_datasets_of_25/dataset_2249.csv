71549,best movies with a cool twist,"> So when Hamill and Prowse saw it in theater for the first time, they were as surprised as anybody.

Incorrect, actually.  Prowse didn't know; he spoke the ""Obi-Wan killed your father"" line. There's an interesting thing about this situation though, because Prowse claimed that Vader was Luke's father well before ESB was even being filmed. But that was likely just a joke that was coincidentally true.  He claims to have not known about the twist, and was actually pretty angry about it.

Either way, Hamill was pulled aside about 5 minutes before shooting began and told the actual line and to act/react with that line in mind, not the ""Obi-Wan killed your father"" line.  And at that point only he, Lucas, and Kershner knew.

Then of course James Earl Jones has to record Vader's dialogue, at which point he knew.

So at the premiere Hamill and Jones knew, Lucas knew, Kershner knew, and it's possible one or two other people might have known due to editing the film and such.  But yeah, Hamill was in on it the whole time.

70548,best major to study in college,"I think your biggest problem is that you are setting yourself up to be bad at math by repeatedly saying and affirming you are bad at it.

Math is hard, not for most not fun. *But literally anybody can learn it with enough effort.*

As a guy who was ""bad at math"" and avoided math for a whole degree, hated his job, then went back to school into a math heavy program and succeeded with the proper effort, I'm telling you it is possible if you really want it.

Think about your real, honest experience: did you grind for hours doing practice problems? Did you get a tutor? Did you go to every single class, and regularly take your questions to the professor's office hours? Or did you get frustrated, do the bare minimum, and declare yourself ""bad at math""?

Here's the hard pill to swallow about hard academic subjects, the ""smart"" people very likely are not any smarter than you, *they're just trying harder*."
