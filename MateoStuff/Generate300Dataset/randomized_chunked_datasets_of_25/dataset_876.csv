65653,best phone service company,"I currently have Wing’s unlimited plan for $55/mo on AT&T’s network and it includes HotSpot. However, when I told the rep I’d think about it, they baited me with a promo down to $50/mo plus tax, so keep that in mind."
28952,best breakfast foods,"Little late to the party it seems.

Biscuits and Gravy is a **must** in my family, it's easy and cliché but everyone loves it."

54901,best water filter,"> My hot water doesn't smell so terrible all the time

8688,best toothpaste,"So, be straight with me:

Stannous fluoride is making a huge splash in the toothpaste market.  Is it really batter than sodium fluoride?  I used to buy the toothpaste with the two active ingredients to fight gingivitis bacteria, but stannous fluoride is supposedly like a catch-all."
3328,best webcamera,If your looking for the best possible picture from a webcam you are better off going cheap on the camera and then spending the extra money on a pair of diffused desk lamps with adjustable power. Most houses are no equiped with enough lights to get a great video even with an expensive camera. 90% of the time you are going to be so small on a 1080p(max) screen that 720 is even overkill.

66236,best soccer team in the world,"Bayern have more CL finals than you, the same number of wins, and more league titles. There isn't really a metric where Barca are ahead of Bayern.

As for us, we both have 8 CL finals, 5 CL wins, and you have 7 more league titles, so I get why you'd be ahead of us. 

You're not ahead of Bayern though, not yet anyway."
12598,best gifts for mom,That doesn't really do shit either. The best solution is to rip the carpet off of the fucking ground and get rid of it because it's a horrible human invention.

42961,best detective show,Noticed Breaking bad wasn’t on your list but better call Saul is. If you haven’t seen BB I’d recommend it! It’s really good. If you have seen it then you already know how good it is
10700,best suitcase lock,Where are you flying?  Anyone who wants to get into your luggage will anyway.  Just don't put anything valuable in them.  The TSA keys are widely available.
