But the number one way to get girls to talk to you with music would be to have a crowd looking at you. Girls fucking love it when some guy is important, and if there are 20 people watching you work, you're important to somebody.

So if you want my advice, learn how to play in front of a crowd.",best instrument to play

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
> At this point the algorithm only takes into account win/draw/loss and I would like to include margins in the future. 

There is a [summary paper](http://mathstore.ac.uk/headocs/8311_duckworth_f_duckworthlewis.pdf) by Duckworth (yes, that one) where he says that D/L is a much better way of assessing victory margins compared to the currently used methods, namely NRR.

> For instance, they still prefer to stick with ‘net run rate’ as a second criterion for splitting sides in leagues or min-leagues, despite the D/L based alternatives that are available.

I have read it in one of their previous papers but can't currently place it. You should definitely dig around there if you want to include margins. I'll PM you if I find it.

Also let me know if you need any help with collecting data. I have an ever-growing collection of cricket data and can help you set up jobs that can download data from cricinfo.

I also have an algorithm in mind for creating more fair player rankings, which I expect you'd want to include at some point. So let me know if you want to team up on it...",best cricket teams of all time
