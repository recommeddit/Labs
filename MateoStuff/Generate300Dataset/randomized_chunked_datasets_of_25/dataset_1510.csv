It's not the scalpel cutting flesh away from your body that hurts the most during the procedure, it's whatever liquid they inject into you to deaden the nerves around the cancer that hurts.  The needles don't hurt but that shit they inject into you is f'ing nasty.  

Wear your sunscreen kids."

16665,best pet for toddlers,"Oh I liked that show!

Crickets aren't the only food, there is also mealworms, but they're often recommended not to be the staple diet because they have some hard bits that can cause impaction too (their heads mostly I think) however I've also heard this is mostly an issue for baby geckos. I find them more gross compared to crickets because they crawl inside a substrate and can metamorphose into little black beetles.

There's a small kind of roach called nubia roach as well, but they are banned in Canada so not an option for me.

Crickets are a little stinky when you open their box, but they can't bite, and at night they often chirp, which I like.

If you give them paper towel tubes in their box, you can just use the tubes to feed the gecko--crickets will hide inside, so you just cover both ends and tap or shake the tube into the gecko tank. Should peek inside the tube to see how many because if you shake too hard on a full tube you get like 50 crickets in the tank--that's way too many.

Also if a cricket or two escapes your container it's no big deal. They need particular conditions for breed. At worst you hear it chirping for a few days until it dies.

tbh while I don't love having to feed crickets, it is pretty fun watching a gecko hunt them."

22363,best celebrity,I met him down in Nantucket one summer a few years ago. I had no money and so he bought me and my friends a pizza and shared it with us. Probably the greatest moment of my life.
54002,best medicine for a cold,"And (I reply in a cartoonishly huffy tone) had I meant vitamin c I would have said vitamin c.

My regimen is very specific: begin drinking a half gallon of orange juice in the morning and spend the day drinking it until it's gone.

I make no mention of vitamin c, so I find myself cartoonishly huffy that you would bring it up at all."

68103,best science fiction novel,"The part in exile is actually where it really starts to kick in.  It gets weirder until, as the other posters have said, it turns a corner and it all clicks, which is satisfying for like a million different reasons..  it’s earned and not contrived. In my opinion Stephenson’s best ending, I feel like I see other posters give him shit about not being able to finish a book.  Anyway, Anathem is one of my favorite books :)"

31682,best hotel to live in,"Same room.  I'm thinking of changing Hotel chains altogether just for a drastic change, but it will hard leaving this place.  It's home and the staff is excellent.  I have a bag of clothes, a laptop, a guitar and a shit ton of books.  I seem to buy them constantly.  When I check out of a place, I'm usually mailing a box of books back home.  I've never asked for changes in furnishings.  I'm not sure what they would change it to."
