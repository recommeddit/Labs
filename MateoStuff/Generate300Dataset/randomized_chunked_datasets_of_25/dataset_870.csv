6785,best iPhone,"First iPhone SE went strong for so long, just needs a battery replacement and it would still work fine.

iPhone 11 Pro is my next choice, but mainly for the cameras."

70214,best major to study in college,"Okay, I am tired of this best and worst career thing. A career is defined as: An occupation undertaken for a significant period of a person's life and with opportunities for progress. The top on that list was Medical Assisting Services and Management Information Systems. Who REAAALLLLLY wants to do that for the rest of their life? In a country where the second question people ask when meeting you is, ""What do you do?"" why would you want to say medical assisting? I hate all of this bull shit of pushing people away from the liberal arts. Yeah, it's fucking hard, if not harder because most of those careers you need to work independently in order to have a successful career. It's hard to start your own business and it's easier to just work for someone else. Did it use to be? Hell no. But now that the world revolves around FINDING a job instead of MAKING a job, yeah those degrees aren't going to benefit you as much as having an engineering degree. I am not made to become a medical assistant, I could do it if I wanted, however I refuse to let that define me and bring in my income. I would rather work to have my own, selling cat toys off the street and make poverty line salary. Someone has to be the medical assistant, but someone also has to make cat toys, so fuck it."
61845,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yeah I definitely would play it more of a solo thing, so I'm not sure how that would play out."

52293,best hiphop album,">Without NWA, rap would be nothing

Without Jamaican toasting, DJ Kool Herc, or west African griots, modern rap would be nothing. How far back do you want to go? NWA was certainly integral to the west coast rap scene during the late 80s and their cultural impact on rap was felt well into the 90s, but to make such declarative and hyperbolic statements as ""rap would be nothing"" makes you sound like a gatekeeping rap elitist."
25860,best cricket teams of all time,That just goes to show how dominant we are at home
51134,best rap album,">It has a good mix of genres

>it's not a great mix of genres by any means

a third of those are styles of rock music"
8391,best toothpaste,Also not a dentist but I wouldn't recommend putting your dick in your eyes.
45382,best gaming system,"Yeah, this is pretty much me right now. 

In regards to PlayStation, they have too many amazing games I don't want to miss out on. I'm happy to play it on PS5 first, and then if the game is good enough, I'll buy it again on PC like I did with Horizon Zero Dawn. I'd rather not have to wait a couple years for some of these games, but that's just me. 

As for the Switch, obviously I'm there for their exclusives, but there are some games I may get on Switch instead or double up on both PC and the Switch like Hades or Enter the Gengeon. Being able to play portably is just too convenient. I'd love to get a PC handheld like the Switch."
12873,best gifts for mom,Was thinking this as I submitted it. I no English well.
10725,best suitcase lock,LPT: read comments of LPTs for best LPTs.
11530,best gifts for dad,"Dude, before you die you should make a catalogue that has as much information as you can remember about them. That'll help solidify it as a tradition."
30295,best Mexican war to study,"As for the rest, I am of the opinion that Carthage must be destroyed."
26670,best board games,"1. Codenames - an instant classic. Anyone introduced to this one catches on and clicks immediately. Also plays with large groups

2. Dominion - may have a dry theme and won't catch players immediately, but the replayability is immense It's incredibly expandable in numerous directions but the base game will last months of frequent play without any need.

3. Carcassonne - another that anyone introduced to will grab on to and become fierce competition. People become addicted to these little cardboard tiles.

4. Pandemic - the most balanced of co-op games. The game will defeat players and give them the itch to play more.

5. Cube Quest - every collection needs a dexterity game and this is easy to set up, quick to play, and incredibly simple. 

6. Chinatown - easy sell with new players ""a more refined Monopoly"" can be a miss with people who have experience working in sales might bounce off this one. 

7.  No Thanks - quick filler, easy to pick up, quick to play, people usually won't say no to a round of this while waiting on pretty much anything.

8. Tsuro - plays up to 8 people while remaining quick and simple. 

9. The Resistance - what is a game collection without a social deception game? May not be the fastest or most simple, but it's refined and elegant.

10. Dead of winter - a bit more complex than any of the others on the list, but a meaty co-op game with a traitor usually hits the mark. Zombies might not click with everyone, but the game itself is great and the crossroads provides a very unique and thematic experience."
34083,best NFL player,"Again, who said anything about being shitty?

Also, plenty of people played for 20 years while not always being elite. Even Jerry Rice was little more than a number 3 receiver in the twilight of his career."
