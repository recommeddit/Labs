Also, Admobs TOS states that a minimum percentage of fills must come from Admob if using their mediation service.  Of course, you will never know why your account is banned because they will not tell you."

14543,best romantic novel,"[The Spymaster's Lady by Joanna Bourne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959745.The_Spymaster_s_Lady) is my favourite book. It is so good that it is far beyond, ""too good to put down"" and has achieved the rarefied level of, ""can hardly bear to pick up again"" because you are savoring what has already happened, but are also afraid that this sublime quality cannot be maintained. Spoiler— the quality is maintained.

It is a adventure romance of enemies in Napoleonic France and England where the attraction is founded upon respect for each other's skill and character, with physical sex appeal secondary.

The heroine, Annique Villiers, is one of the four characters in my, ""Pantheon of heroines"".

Don't look at the cover. It is undoubtedly sabotage, the work of a jealous rival who knows they will never equal this work ;-)

BTW, this is not the sort of topic where every, or even most comments require a reply for politeness. An upvote like I do on WDYR is sufficient thanks."
66309,best soccer team in the world,"Yeah joint rated is most accurate. League titles you guys lead 20-18, Liverpool lead champions leagues 5-3, fa cups united are ahead 12-7, uefa cup/europa league is Liverpool 3-1 and the league cup is Liverpool 8-5. So according to that both sides have 41 major trophies apiece. United jump ahead when you include Community Shield as its 17-10 in those but whether or not thats a major trophy is up for debate.

Seems ive misread the community shield records. It is 21-15 overall."

10511,best suitcase lock,"Personally the only locks i use are ""BEST"" locks. 7 pins, pinned/modified by me.   


They can be picked, but even people more skilled than myself take >10 minutes to pick them.  


Those keep a pelican case closed. I use two of them with different key/types (best locks have many different keyways based on the letter of keyway the lock has (Like there is a key A and a key B, and they could have the same pinouts, but fit different keyways. Its actually really neat)"

For dress shoes, legit Crocs. They make more than clogs and my only heels and flats are from there because the default widths there are significantly wider"
