Never thought of that even though I buy other shit on etsy! Thanks!

"Dude I just jammed this album again. It's been a few months. Theres so many great lines and just songs. Is it just me or is that Logic feature is just garbage? It's good they relegated it to the bonus section and put Em on the track.

""Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royal bag."" is a fuck of a line given all the context"
"does it have to do with your career prospects? I'm getting my BA in social science, I love it but I often get anxiety about future career prospects."
"Not sure if I understand your question. Anyway, as I said, naked phone + screen protector (Spigen seems to be the best) is my personal preference. That is how I use it on my 11 pro and same as my gf will use it on her 12 pro. Since I took my Pitaka MagEZ off and realized how it feels, I never went back. If you care how it looks and feels in hand and you can afford Applecare, go for it, you will never regret that.

Otherwise, MagEZ case from Pitaka seems to be the best compromise between style and security. Anything thinner does not seem to have any sense as protection and anything thicker will make your phone look like a brick."
Yes it’s not working on 14. Removed from list . Thanks.

"I just remembered another affordable party favorite. Svedka is incredibly cheap, so I’d buy a bottle or two of the cherry one and mix it with sprite and a little lime sweetener and garnish with lime over ice. It tastes like a cherry limeade but not the medicine kind of cherry. The weaklings love it lol."
"I'm on my #24 jump out of Elsinore. I love my dropzone. My decision was solely base on proximity because I live in the South Bay by Long Beach. Based on all the post, I would use this post by (\_searching\_) as a guide to make my decision. He outlined the nuances and differences between the 3 drop zones. It all depends on what you are looking for as  a ""culture"". In regards to reputation and professionalism, I feel that all 3 drop zones are equal based on what I have heard from other skydivers. 

I hope this helps. Do not hesitate to keep asking the question(s).

I went through an airport security line with Keanu Reeves. He was super cool and open for about a 5 minutes conversation (they had closed the line behind him so it was really just the two of us for a bit). He was even good natured when I asked if I could take a selfie with him. Good dude. Once we got through the line a crowd gathered quickly and security whisked him away.

"No not too bad.  
I did at one point seem very slow speeds (like 200KB/s), but often times I was getting 2-3MB/s.  
One book got upwards of 10MB/s but that seemed to be a fluke."
