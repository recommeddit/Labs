36024,best alcoholic drink,"This doesn't answer your question, but have you ever considered just drinking less?

And like others have said, it's not the calories that kill your work out. Ask anyone who has been on a bulk. The more calories you take in, the more energy you'll have, especially from the night before. If you're drinking minutes before a workout, it makes sense that your workouts suck and you're stupid. It's the hangover/withdrawal from the alcohol that's killing your workouts. 

If you can't sacrifice the alcohol, here's a few things that are good for hangovers. Most important piece: foooooooood. A nice big breakfast. You might not want it, but you need it to get your energy back up and fix that twisting in your stomach. Also, gatorade. Gatorade is good for 2 things, fixing fevers/colds and fixing hangovers. It hydrates you quickly and goes down easily. Water is good, gatorade is better in these situations. And when I say gatorade, I don't mean the sugar free crap. Take the sugar. It'll help settle your stomach as long as you're not drinking more than a bottle. After your next night of drinking just drink a bottle of gatorade (or powerade, or pedialyte, or whatever the fuck advertises electrolytes) in the morning, or even before you go to sleep, with a nice big breakfast."

69553,best major to study in college,"Depends upon what you are studying. Economics or finance, yes, bare minimum. Journalism, probably not. If you want to teach, probably."
40903,best instrument to play,"I play 4 different instruments and by far the easiest to pick up for me was sax. The embouchure doesn't need to be extremely tight and the fingerings are very intuitive. The thing is, it's still not easy, even after 2 years I still can't play on the instrument quickly."
67926,best science fiction novel,"> always provided, of course, that they keep Ridley Scott away from it

Yeah, that dude's absolutely shit at sci-fi films."
33883,best Pokemon game,"When Pokemon Crystal came out, I considered it to be the perfect Pokemon game. Since then, more modern games have introduced great new features, but have always taken a step back in some aspects. Crystal is dated now, but only in terms of graphics. The core mechanics of Pokemon are all there. The only generation that actually improved on the formula for me was Generation 4 with the physical/special split and online capabilities."

39763,best Chrome extensions,Google Earth New Tab. It's cool because it provides something different for you to look at while you type in your Google search. It turns the new tab page into a revolving satellite picture of something on Earth every time a new tab is opened.
53040,best hiphop album,"Yeh it‚Äôs not a bad song; there‚Äôs nothing I really dislike off this tape.  I‚Äôm just not really big on its hook & it takes up a good bitta space on that track.  

I think it also suffers by being next to Caprice after that strong 4 song run at the intro & then being right before one my favs, ‚ÄúBrazil‚Äù, which marks the return to quality again.  I‚Äôma Spitta Andretti fan tho so it all works out.

& yeh SahBabii was the 1st closer to widely known artist I could think‚Äôf that‚Äôd provide some sort of similarity.  He‚Äôs very Thug influenced, but beat selection & overall sound, I think if people rocked w/ SahBabii then they‚Äôd rock w/ this too.

Here‚Äôs 1 from each his albums to checkout & see if you‚Äôll dig his stuff,

[Cracks & Crevices ](https://youtu.be/1C2IQmc5rd0)

[Barnacles](https://youtu.be/7IIbM7Xlnyo)

[Anime World](https://youtu.be/Yov5Q-JEM8o)

If ya like those, then you‚Äôll prolly dig their associated albums too.  Squidtastic as an album will be the weakest of the 3 tho imo."
70074,best major to study in college,"People say this because college is quickly becoming a glorified trade school. As much as you don't like it, universities were intended originally for people to learn for the sake of learning; while it sounds snotty, it doesn't mean that it's not reconcilable with doing something practical either.  

That being said, I'm all for separating academia from trades. I hate the fact how work experience has been replaced by online MBAs or masters in things like ""administration."" as if tacking on masters makes it as legit academically as someone who decided to study something less lucrative like anthropology.  Not crapping on admins, as I have been one for awhile, but I'd be ashamed to admit to anyone I had to pay for and waste time over what should amount to job experience."
27565,best bollywood actor,"Srk:  very charming and witty. May I say he's very masculine too. Like I want SRK to protect me. Sometimes gives me narcissist vibes but that's maybe just me. Anyways, a really cool guy. 

Salman:  bully, manchild, arrogant, wants everyone to agree with him and if they don't then they're in trouble üôÑ don't know what girls find attractive about him. If I ever get involved with a guy like that, I would have run for the hills. 

Aamir:  pseudo intelligent. Comes across as pretty fake to me in his interviews. 

Akshay:  extremely street smart. Looks down on people who are not as successful as him. Intelligent too. 

Ranbir:  either he's a huge narcissist or just an extremely chill guy. There's no in between. Honestly I  think only people really close to him can actually tell how he's like because he never lets his face show his real emotions in his interviews. When I was watching bigg boss, the guy siddharth shukla reminded me of him many times but I really hope Ranbir is not like him. 

Ranveer:  genuinely intelligent and really Smart. Never let his ott behavior fool you, this guy knows his shit. Seems like a fun guy to be around. 

Varun:  humble, down to earth, truly nice person. I think he's really close to his family and the reason why he's genuinely kind is because of his upbringing. Good guy üëç

Kartik:  I have not seen his interviews but I follow him on Instagram and he comes across as a typical small town dude who is trying to make it big. Sometimes look desperate but I don't get any negative vibes from him. Overall sweet guy. 

Ayushmaan: I've been following ayushmaan's career since he used to host TV shows and may I say that success has indeed changed him. He's not a bad guy but he comes across as shallow sometimes. Or maybe he's always been like this. But he's well-read, knows Indian audience and is talented too. He has worked really hard and deserve every bit of his success. I have a soft spot for him lol."

23016,best celebrity,"I met Rob Dyrdek at an outdoor mall in his hometown back in 2011. At the time I was a huge fan and was even wearing a Dyrdek DC hat. He was there for a family members birthday so the whole family was with him. We casually went up to talk to him and he was very kind and respectful. He could see that my friends and I were skateboarders so he stood and talked to us for a minute while the Dad's talked about boats and other dad things. People ran up for quick pictures but he made us feel appreciated for supporting him. He left with telling me, ""I like the hat, God bless"" and they went on with their night. 14 year old me couldn't be happier he was as cool as he seemed."
42215,movies like Inception,"The theatrical cut actually is a bigger mind fuck, because for like 40 minutes after they just tell you what happens in the opening scene you are like ""what the fuck kind of red herring is that"" and then it turns out, no, they weren't joking, that is exactly what happens, which sends you down a meta-mindfuck of why the people behind the film would ever go in that direction artistically."
