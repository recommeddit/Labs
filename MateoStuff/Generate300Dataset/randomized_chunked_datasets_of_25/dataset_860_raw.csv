"I like ActiveState's KomodoEdit. The main reason is it has similar or identical features and behavior and look and feel on Linux and Windows and Mac. I can switch OS's and have at least a text editor with the same look and feel, function keys, macros, ... Yes, people will say the same about emacs or vim or similar, but if you're looking for alternatives..."

Could you recommend a good skincare routine that's beginner friendly? I tried using aveno but the cream feels really thick and I don't like it.
Do you know what the app is called? I can't find it and it would be a lifesaver!!
"Came here to NOT recommend rats (or other small animals) until the kid is at least 5-- and then, definitely a rat! :) 

Though we've had both, my husband is allergic to both dogs and cats. We're all huge animal lovers, though, so we decided when my dD was 4, we'd get a pet. She proved herself pretty good with the class guinea pig over winter break, so we got a pair of rats (my husband and I had also had rats before DD was born-- they're amazing!) Not only had DD done well with the GP, but she's more gentle with animals than easily 90% of her friends.

She loves them. We love them. I wouldn't give them back. However.

Knowing what I know now, I'd have waited until 5. They're small and active (especially being females) and they won't stay still for cuddles. Being less than a pound, they're somewhat fragile (not so much as hamsters, of course)-- my DD does REALLY well with them, and we still have to get on her case not to squeeze them too hard, etc. Nothinh Bad has happened, but it's just stressful (lessening a bit now, but still), and we generally try not to introduce stressful elements into our lives, because why punish and scold (or reward, or restrict) when you can just wait for a more developmentally appropriate window for certain activities? 

It's ""okay,"" in the end, and the rats are no worse for wear, but like I said-- knowing what I know now, I would have waited."
"When I think of the best *team* ever, i don't think it means adding up all the amazing players. I think of it as the best group of players that really work together and have amazing chemistry. For example, Real Madrid nowadays isn't a great team, just a collection of great players. 
The best team I have ever seen was Atlético Madrid 2013-2014. The entire squad had the same philosophy and played their roles so well. Simeone's 4-4-2 that didn't emphasize possession but rather maximize chances was perfectly geared against top tier clubs, and the playing styles were easily adjusted game-to-game. Diego Costa scored when he wanted because he harrassed the opposition's back line, Gabi, Koke, and the midfield cut off passing lanes without overcommiting, Godin and Miranda shut down world class forwards, Juanfran and Felipe Luis were threatening on attack and solid in defense. To top it all off, Courtois was a top 3 keeper that year, and saved our asses many times. Winning the league over the giants Barca and Real was incredible, and coming sooooooooo close to winning the Champions League was miraculous given the lack of (at that time) star players and financial resources. Atlético was successful that season because they were the best team in the world."

"Hello I'm looking for a laptop that can support productivity tasks and can run a virtual desktop for work (citrix workspace). Considering the M1 macbook air (16GB ram, considering 512GB storage) but compatibility to the virtual desktop is my main gripe esp for excel. What would you suggest? Something similar to the MBA price is okay"

"SRK is my favourite actor, and the reason being his acting, his persona, his charm on screen and his energy.

I grew up watching his movies more than any other actors. Both my elder siblings were SRK fans back then too, so naturally that had an influence on me. 

I have become a fan of his more through watching lesser known movies like Duplicate, Yes Boss and Baadshah.

His is the reason why I got into box office and movies in the first place. I even wrote an article on a box office forum about how my craze for box office increased through SRK movies: http://forums.itsboxoffice.com/629204/the-increase-in-craze-for-box-office-shown-through-srk-movies"

"> OK. Tell that to the Freedom Caucus. 

The fact that you would illustrate a second master both confirms the status quo and adds another vehicle for representatives to betray their constituents.

> ""Honestly representing their constituents and the constitution"" is as vague an answer as this vague-ass question. 

Sure, but it's a specific criterion that requires a little brain power to evaluate.  To claim it's useless because it doesn't provide an in-hand metric for the entire legislature is stupid.

> So if my representative is in Texas, how does he or she honestly represent the constitution? They represent their constituents who feel one way or the other.

They have an obligation to both.  And it gets deeper, because they have to weigh (probably) a majority's desire to have fullies with drum mags to hunt and masturbate to, against a minority whose lives may be in the balance.  Throw on top of that one's interpretation of the right to bear arms and you have a difficult question that is worthy of being someone's day job.

What's the right answer?  Not trading your vote for an NRA endorsement."

"For me? Lol i need a laptop to run After Effects and Cinema 4d smoothly.

So Ill be heavy dependent on RAM and Graphic Cards. Will need a big laptop too so 17"" at least with a good colour display (as I make color grading too).

Still trying to figure out the processor that I need but the listing you made is actually very impressive. 

Im investing a lot into this, at least for my position, so I will try to make the best buy out of the money. 

Id go with M1 but im not a fan of apple products, havent used iphone in 10 years and as much as I read, it still lacks in performance compared to windows laptops while using gpu dependant softwares


So if you have any suggestion, id be very thankful. Not much of a pc geek"

"I met Kristen Wiig at a retail job I had a few years ago. She was with her parents. I mentioned something complimentary to her dad because I don't like bothering celebs, but he responded with, ""Hey, Kristen! You've got a fan over here!"" She came back down the stairs, shook my hand, introduced herself. She was very pleasant.

I also recently met Rich Sommer (Harry Crane from Mad Men). I rang up his wine at a prominent, known-for-cheap-prices wine shop. I didn't say anything until the transaction was about done, then got a handshake so I could say I'd officially met him. He was a nice, normal guy. No story there, really. I was just super stoked to meet him."
