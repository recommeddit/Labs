"Fair. The truck to home is an added feature but one I don’t really care about as my solar system has a battery, so it’s unlikely I’d use it. The battery on the base model is “small” but still rated at 230 miles while pulling 1000 pounds, and up to 400+ miles empty. 

Again, I looked at the base model and didn’t really see much that I would want to pay more for. I have a side hustle handyman business of sorts so it will most likely pay for itself."

"This is what i have started doing on my birthday.  I figure out exactly what I want to do and email my friends and say ""let me know if you wanna join and what parts you want to join for"".

Last year I got an early dinner of German food then went to see a movie and was in bed by 10pm.  Thats a great day to me."

"I'd recommend Caverna over Agricola. Bit pricey but it was the Agricola killer for me. Bought mine on sale for $62. My gaming group, who love Agricola, say Caverna is their favorite game we have played to date."
