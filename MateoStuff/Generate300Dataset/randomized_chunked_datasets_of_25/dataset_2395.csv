10796,best suitcase lock,"Well I put these zip ties on my pelican case when I fly with firearms. The TSA has to have you present when they check firearms so if I see my case coming off the baggage belt and the zip ties are gone or damaged I'm taking it straight to TSA to open and inspect. It means they broke the law/rules. I usually do two different color zip ties on each latch with locks. Firearms cases can use non-TSA locks as well. However, I wouldn't put it passed some TSA people to not care or cut them without realizing the rules. 

It's kind of difficult to just open your firearms case up to make sure you have all your contents unaltered at an airport."

64602,Best Nike running shoes,"Counterpoint: These are okay shoes with the Nike gloss that makes them come across as better than they are.

5% of Nike’s output is made up of high-performance sports cars. The other 95% are budget sedans with the same paint jobs as their faster, though very distant, cousins."

30524,best Mexican war to study,You are correct. The family changed the name to sound more Hispanic and blend in. Interesting since he is arguably the best military mind ever to come out of Mexico.
25045,best spiderman actor,What is this insanity?
39170,best web browser,"Another vote for Opera from me. :) Use with uBlock Origin and DuckDuckGo. Can even install Chrome extensions if that's your cup of tea. No issues on my end for the past couple of years - privacy or otherwise. It's better than Vivaldi in terms of stability (it was very buggy for me when I gave it a trial, but you may like it! Give it a whirl!), and for me, personally, it's been faster and less taxing on my machine than Firefox."
1838,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I was going to recommend Lilsy’s too, great stuff."
17491,best iOS game,"> Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever,

This is how I felt after completing Transistor. I a little fucked up for about half a day."
36412,best alcoholic drink,Nothing beats a mojito on a hot day for me. Any variation of it is awesome.
51173,best rap album,"True, but giving a wave of downvotes to anyone who mentions them in a music discussion sub gives a far different impression."

Businesses can offer free services and be completely transparent about the other sides of their model which generate revenue.

Many ideas are successful not because they allow you to do something you otherwise couldn't but because they allow you to do something better.

108,best terminal file manager reddit,Anything I have to do with zip files can usually be handled well enough by the standard `zip` util I have installed plus the things I mentioned above. But admittedly I don't work with them or jars all that much.
22066,best celebrity,"Nick Jonas is extremely soft spoken and really kind. He called ahead to the restaurant I worked in at the time to book a table for his family— him, his parents, both grandmothers, younger brother, and one of his grandfathers. His younger brother was moving in to college and Nick was in town for a show, so he took them to brunch. He was incredibly kind to the staff, tipped really well, and was adorably teasing Frankie about being the kid their parents would be most proud of— Frankie is the only one of the four Jonas brothers to go to college."

42036,movies like Inception,Don't tell me way down here at the bottom. Find some courage and tell the person with the memento comment at the top.
13328,best spreadsheet editor,"Yeah, Excel 365 collaboration is no comparison against Google Sheets. With Sheets, you can lock tabs to specific users. I found in Excel 365, there's certain things you cannot do when multiple people have the doc open like refresh a query. Also, you cannot refresh a query with Excel 365 through a browser.

Obviously there's pros and cons of each. I just migrated a shared doc from Sheets to Excel 365 because I needed more advanced functions available in Excel, but at the loss of the better collaboration features, which I ended up replacing with a combination of Microsoft Forms and Microsoft Power Automate."
