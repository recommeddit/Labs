"Spider-Man Homecoming needs to be way higher (top 5 or 6) and the first Captain America needs to be way lower.

Other than that, I have no major disagreements with this ranking."
"For the 6 feet/2 meter cables, this would seem important to me. Voltage could definitely drop below the standard of, what is it, 10%? I do have to agree with you, I don't see a lot of these cables sold."
"Because by your standards anything can be justified. War World II? Yup, nationalist socialist party of Germany wanted it, so according to them the war is justified. Holocaust? Again, that was done according to the nationalist socialist party. There is really nothing to discuss with you, your opinion is that if some entity wants to wage a war then they have full right to wage and damn the consequences."
Medical Geography actually! I think it would be useful and I think it would have made for a better college experience. I’m finishing up my psych degree now and I don’t feel accepted in my program. I am excited to just be done. Sometimes I just look at the class list for a medical geography degree and dream. We all make mistakes!

"Pseudoephedrine is rather effective in shutting down mucus production. I've had the best luck with the non-extended release versions.

Oh, and Fisherman's Friend lozenges. They taste like sucking on a piece of stone soaked in windex, but *goddamn* do they clear your nose and sinuses up."
"Holy crap, thank you for being my voice of reason, you flipped me out of my toothpaste trance, Iv'e even been getting closer to the computer to read this shit."

Spigen Tough Armor Mag. I was debating between the Tough Armor Regular and the Tough Armor Mag and figured why not.

"It had been a rough year. I had been arrested about a year and a half previous to that Christmas and was still dealing with much of the more immediate fallout of that, my sister was having some mental health issues, everyone in my family except me had just moved halfway across the country a couple months prior, my great-grandma was wallowing in depression and nobody knew how long she was gonna stick out (she’s *still* with us to everyone’s surprise), and my parents were on and off with the idea of separation and/or divorce.

I take great pride in picking out the perfect gifts for my entire family, but I’ve always had trouble with my mom. She wasn’t working at the time, she doesn’t have much in the way of hobbies outside of just plain relaxing and socialization, she’s not horribly adventurous, and they lived halfway across the country now so buying her an experience would be difficult with no idea what was over there to experience.

I wasn’t really what you would consider outwardly emotional at the time. Although I’ve definitely gotten better at wearing my heart on my sleeve, I can name you the two times through my teen years that I cried and what they were for. That said, I decided I’d write her a letter. A handwritten letter in my nicest cursive about why I love her and why I wouldn’t trade her for the world. I went over the Hell my family had been through that year, talked about how I admired her handling of it throughout all of it, described all the character traits she has that I hope to one day develop or strengthen in myself, talked about how me and people I’ve observed look up to her, and generally just took my natural descriptive rambling and put it to good use.

She was smart enough to find a mildly secluded corner to read it in after I told her I wrote her a letter but not to read it until after everyone’s gifts, but I still got to glance over at her occasionally and see her trying (and failing) to hold in her tears. I’ve gotten plenty of family members gifts that they enjoyed, that made their face brighten up, or simply things that say “I thought of you when buying this,” but writing that letter for my mom and seeing her reaction is a memory I will cherish until I grow into a crotchety old man who can’t even remember if I took my prostate pills at all that week.

That was 4 years ago. I’m thinking I might do it again this year now that some time has passed and I’ve grown even more as a person and tear up every time I start thinking of how little I deserve a family like I was blessed with. I might even do it for all my family members, and only partially because I’m a poor college student that can’t buy 7 people things for every holiday."

Their average ratings are 8.31 (Endgame) and 8.27 (Black Panther). There isn’t that much of a discrepancy.
"Shoot, I wouldn't want to go by myself to a hotel, I'd want my husband there too to have some us time w/out worrying about the baby."
"I would have to go with [The Hallmarks of Cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallmarks_of_Cancer).  (pdf [here](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fedomany/Bioinfo05/lecture6_Hanahan.pdf)).

If you have ever wanted to know how cancer works, this is the paper for you.  The authors go step by step through 6 molecular characteristics that almost all cancers share, including what they are, how they arise, and what they do/how they lead to cancer."
"The more I look into it, the more I find myself leaning towards a Nintendo Switch...it seems pretty user friendly and the game selection seems more up my alley.  I suppose if I end up liking it, I could also splurge and get a PlayStation, too!"

"Toby was best Peter. The other dude was the best Spider-Man. The young kid, I have no idea cause I haven’t seen him in anything."
"one of the great endings. simple and massively effective. and of course, completely predictable yet inevitable for the protagonist."

"I'd go with whites and greys. They give you a classic, modern look, keep the kitchen looking open, and will go with your cabinetry and counters. 

Something like the Jubilee (SW 6248) or Misty (6232) on the Sherwin Williams website contrasted with white trim.

Edit: I just came back from painting someone's house, and the kitchen had similar countertops and cabinetry. The walls were painted a darker grey, which complimented the hardware and stainless steel in the appliances and contrasted with the white cabinets nicely. It was beautiful."
I've had rats for 3 years. They are incredibly expensive when you factor in appropriate housing and vet bills and they absolutely must be kept in pairs.  Good exotics vets are also few and far between.
