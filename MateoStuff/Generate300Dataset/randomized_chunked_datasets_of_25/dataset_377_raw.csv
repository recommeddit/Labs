I also heard that Firefox is also a cool plugin for chrome *flies away*
"A good showerhead. I cannot stress enough how a high quality showerhead can turn getting clean into utterly zen, 30 minute self healing and relaxation session.

Edit: ok clarification, I don't shower for 30 min every day. Modern rain showerheads use very little water and I only have about 15 min to get ready in the morning so this is a rare treat I let myself do once or twice a month. I appreciate the loving comments."
"it is ranked #700,000+."

Are these girls 35+ by any chance?
"I generally prefer contemporary romance. Alisha Rai, Alyssa Cole, Julie Anne Long, and Alexa Martin are great. Beverly Jenkins is a master. Christina Lauren's books are fantastic. (For the most part, these are all cishet romances. But Alyssa Cole just released a wlw novella as part of the Reluctant Royals series. I haven't read it yet but Twitter has been positive!)"

I took it the way that guy said as well. It was most definitely implied that way.
"Hello

I've been eyeing the [Asus Zenbook 14](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultra-Slim-i5-1035G1-Thunderbolt-UX425JA-EB51/dp/B08KH9SX3G/ref=pd_ybh_a_4?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=P51TKX0M0BJB1TFRQ1YG&th=1) for nearly two months now (wish i pulled the trigger during the black friday deals). The i7-10 has been out of stock for awhile now on amazon, best buy, and asus website. I do notice that newegg appears to have it in stock (i find it odd they do but the other dont). My question, is there a major difference between the i7-10 and i7-11 - in terms of daily use and for long-term use. Do you think the i7-10 will come back in stock or is it just worth getting the i7-11?"
"Coffee is great.

My mom got me a subscription to a small roaster in California. Now every few weeks a bag of some single origin coffee shows up on my doorstep, and it's *delicious*. 

I've straight up told her not to bother with any other gifts. Just get me that for the rest of my life."
Number of papers published could be pretty deceptive. Weighting the papers by impact factor would be one step closer.
I am a big fan of the Musgrave scoring pencil and the Harvest. I do like all the Japanese pencils you mention but I think the Musgrave compares favorably.

"Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game that had the disservice of coming out the same year as Breath of the Wild and doesn't get enough credit because of it.

It's a great game and a great RPG. Definitely worth getting it."
These videos seem to be about laptop webcams. OP is talking about USB webcams.
"It's a very difficult choice, but here's my list:

* Peter F. Hamilton's *Pandora's Star* and *Judas Unchained*. Formally space opera, these novels have everything a sci-fi fan can desire.

* *Hyperion* and *The Fall of Hyperion*, by Dan Simmons. The same as the previous (However, I not enjoyed the irregular *Ilium* Saga by this author).

* *Evolution*, by Stephen Baxter

* *River of Gods*, by Ian McDonald (Actually almost any novel by this author, for example the two published *Moon* novels).

* *Stars my Destination* or *The Demolished Man*, by Alfred Bester.

Special mentions: *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K LeGuin and *The Golden Age* by John C. Wright

Sorry because there are many more novels to mention, especially in the classics"
vk is great.
Fork it. Fix it yourself. Share it with the open source world.
"This game feels like a proper successor to Fallout, just in space and not so buggy. It is a good time."
American optical is what you're looking for. also look at Amazon
I own both. I’ve put maybe 10 hours into 1. I’m coming up on 100 hours on 2. 2 is one of the best games I’ve ever played. You can play it without ever having touched 1 and be perfectly fine.
