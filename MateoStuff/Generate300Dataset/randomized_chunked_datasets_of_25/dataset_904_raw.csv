If you have Amazon Prime you might really enjoy the show Unforgotten based on what you described. It focuses on a team that solves murders that happened decades ago based on recently discovered remains. Each season focuses on solving one case. Itâ€™s excellently acted and ends up being very personal/emotional due to the way the main characters treat each case. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s similar to Broadchurch in tone and style. Probably my favorite crime show.
"The worst is malted milk balls.  The problem isn't that they taste the worst, it's that they're a DIRTY TRICK.  Oh this looks like it's made of chocolate, I'll try it!  NO."
"Ah I see what you mean. I was just trying to come up with funny sounding alternatives, without regard to the semantic thing."
"My partner and I don't eat breakfast on weekdays so we usually go all out on weekends. I do have one favorite classic, though.

Salted and peppered sunny side up eggs (I guess? I want the whites totally solid but I like my yolks runny so I turn them to low after they begin to set and put a lid over the pan--what the hell is this called?), sausage and/or slightly soft bacon, buttered toast. I love dunking everything in the yolk. Then I chuck the whites because I'm a big baby and hate them.

I can't describe how much I love this combination. It reminds me of when my gramps used to babysit and I'd wake up to the smell of sausage. It is the loveliest breakfast to me still."
"There are RTX 3000 on the gaming laptop list, are you saying to avoid those?"
"I can speak German and my colleague put it best ""Your degree in German isn't useful in Germany. You may be surprised, but many people can speak it there."""

">because its awkward walking up to a house with someone staring you down until you reach the door

That's a good tip! Thank you so much. I was indeed planning on staring at people as they come up--just to people watch and check out costumes as kids go by. Now I know that's creepy.  =)"
"I'm sure he was enjoying you not knowing who he was, probably wanted to see how long it would last"
You may want to consider carrying two 10000mah packs instead of one 20000mah packs if charging quickly in town is a priority. With a two-port charger you can charge twice as quickly.
"My mother is constantly telling me that I ""shut her out"" and that she ""just wants to be part of my life.""  The problem is, every time she calls or I visit, she ends up nagging me or treating me like a child. (I'm 28.) Plus she constantly brings up subjects she knows we disagree on.

This has generally led to me dreading talking to her / seeing her, because if I'm around her for more than 10 minutes it virtually guarantees that she'll bring up something we strongly disagree about. Religion, politics, etc etc.

Then, this leads to us either having an argument about said topic, or me just withdrawing and not saying anything at all in order to avoid the argument in the first place.  This is why I try to avoid talking to her now at all.

The few times that I've been with her and we've managed to avoid the topics we disagree on, things go ok.

In any case - my advice to you:  Treat your kids like close friends now. They are also adults and can think for themselves. Avoid topics you know you disagree about. Keep any nagging to a minimum.  Don't be passive aggressive about anything. If my mom followed this advice, I'd see her a lot more often."

Shameless is such a shame. One of the best shows period for years and then fell off a cliff.
"Oyster.com is good.

Also dont set your mind immediately to the all inclusive places. Local cuisine is often a big positive of traveling and you can usually have a room plus food, drink, entertainment for a similar cost to an all inclusive."
"I pretty much agree with you.

A small dogwood would also be nice.  Crape Myrtle would also be nice."
"I thank you for your upvote as this is a discovery. In return, here is a [relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1053/)."
What about us ðŸ˜­
"Same here. 

Ours are smallish (8lbs and 25lbs) and basically have the run of a 1500sqft house, so they exercise themselves indoors all day. Then, once let outside, run the permiter to chase away all the vermin. By the time they come back in, they're passing out.

Dogs > Puppies"
Yeah what this guy said.
