The Room, the shower (glass in the middle of the room), the people. It was awesome and perfect for a romantic weekend."
23086,best celebrity,"Jean-Claude Van Damme was on the same flight as me. He was super friendly.

Emma Watson (during her Harry Potter years) used to frequent a 
restaurant I worked at, she was always very nice.

46623,best trick or treating candy,I've lived in IL most of my life and I'd have guessed Reeses. I wouldn't have put Jolly Ranchers in the top 10. I would have thought even gross-ass Smarties were higher in sales.

27906,best breakfast foods,"Put 2 Shredded wheats in a bowl. Fill it with boiling water. After 15 seconds or so, strain off the boiling water.

Add butte and sugar to taste, mix thoroughly with the hot, soggy shredded wheat and enjoy.

My mum learned to make this because my dad's mum made it for him. His family was from Liverpool. I've no idea whether that was a local dish or just a family tradition."

Also note that T-mobile coverage is non-existent in Nebraska"
37809,best Marvel movie,"With so many high points, the one aspect of this movie that most stuck with me was Tony Leung as Wenwu. Damn, that guy can act.

Canada and especially America....in my opinion wouldn’t even be in the top 10 best countries to live in.                                            Source: A Canadian that travels.
