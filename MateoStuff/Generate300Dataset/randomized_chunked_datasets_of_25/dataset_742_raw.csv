"What else did you expect him to do? Hillary was still a democrat and it would make the most sense for him to get his supporters on her side. Especially if a man as polarizing as Trump was leading on the republican side. People unite to take down a common enemy all the time, even if they don't like each other. I wouldn't call that selling out at all."
"Light perfumes, my first loves! 

Kate Spade Truly Dazzling - a salty water lily beauty that stands out among all my freshies and is an easy reach. I think the Truly line may be getting discontinued, but I still see bottles at Ulta on sale if you can snatch one up.

Dior Addict EDT - similar to Versace Bright Crystal but nicer IMO. Zesty and fresh with musk in the base. Good for really hot days.

DKNY Nectar Love - sunshine and happiness in a bottle! Light sweet florals and fruits covered in sweet honey, but stays fresh throughout."
I’m team Rusty’s (granted haven’t tried much else) but love the pan with Hawaiian toppings.
What do you run that goes down to 35 FPS?
Broadchurch is maybe the best show on US Netflix right now. It will ruin other tv for you for a bit but it’s well worth it.
"Vodka and vodka, i call it ""The Russian""."
Honestly it's ironic half the stuff getting upvoted around here is owned by Luxottica brands anyways.
"I recently asked the pharmacist about OTC drugs when I was super sick and her suggestion was to not take any of them, so... sometimes that isn’t always helpful."
"The implementation intention is easy. The courage to commit to it is more complicated. 

We're afraid of rejection. But our fear of rejection is more powerful then actual rejection. 

Ask a friend to be your ""sponsor"" aka someone to make fun of you if you bail. 

Go to a mall or bar or park and ask the first 5 females you see who are around your age and ask them for their phone number. 

Your face will be red, you'll stutter and stumble, and likely get no numbers. But, you'll have faced one of modern humans most base fear. Aaaaand, you'll be alive. 

This is a good first step."
"Vanilla Vibes from Juliette Has a Gun (yes, that’s the actual brand name)"
"Actually the official title is Bron | Broen, depending on the season, Bron || Broen season 2.

Bridge in Danish, Swedish.

This show has been copied three times - US and Mexico, France and England and I think somewhere in Eastern Europe."

"I met [Garth Brooks](http://imgur.com/Ao8Y1.png) along with 20 other people backstage... in the 90's. I was the first person and mentioned Stillwater, OK; he played in bars there when he first started. He chatted with everyone for about an hour. Before we were ushered out, he called out my name and gave me another hug.

I met [Tori Amos](http://i.imgur.com/kWk8S.png) three or four times. She only met a few people after each show, but would talk 15-20 minutes to each one. Very funny and very hot in person.

A guy I knew worked at a record store in Orlando and we received backstage passes all the time. I met other musicians, but Garth and Tori are my favorites."
Spotify premium $5 student deal. I use it every day.
I only remember it because I remembered the Alamo.

Fantastic movie!
"I am only mentioning talented actors like Ayush and Kartik Aryan (self-made also).
Actually even Ayush ne bhi khud ko banaya hai....arpita ka pati"

"I think the arm sinking is more if you lean your forearm into the table or not. I have a sit/stand desk, when I'm standing my forearm isn't too bad and xsoft is fine, but when I lower it I use a kneeler to sit and I tend to lean in a bit too much.

Three choices... Hmm... My top 3 would be otsu v2, hien, and shidenkai. I love zero, but I think otsu gives me all the control I need and I love Raiden, but if I want to go super fast the shidenkai is more fun. That being said... It's extremely hard to narrow that in!

Hell I'll give you my favorites in order... Otsu v2, hien, shidenkai, Raiden, zero. Zero on bottom might surprise some people, but I really think otsu v2 does the control just about as good and that's the best thing about the zero. Other thing to keep in mind... I'd rate the zero a 9/10 pad lol... It might be my lowest, but they're all s tier pads and the others are beneath them IMO."
"In terms of battery life and heat, do you suggest a laptop with an Intel proc or a Ryzen proc? **edit** Went with an m1 laptop"
"the way i do it, it takes a while, but it’s not particularly hard. you have to make one curry paste, then use that to make another curry paste, then use THAT to make the sauce base. i make it in bulk and freeze it so i only have to put in all the work every once in a while."
I'm OG... grew up on the pioneers...  but I peep a lot of modern cats for the sake of keeping the art alive... there are plenty of gems out there.... but record companies exploited our culture and have flooded the hip hop scene with shit artists.... because the demand is there and will pay....    just making it harder to find those gems....  there are some legends out there in the making... Joyner being one
