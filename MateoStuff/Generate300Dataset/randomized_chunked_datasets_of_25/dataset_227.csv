59393,best perfume,Clinique Happy
58422,best cologne,"Hmm, I'm guessing you do not mean unwashed neckbeard smell.  You may want to be careful giving out that advice on reddit.  Unless, of course, you actually do like that smell.  In which case, carry on."
68595,best science fiction novel,The bobiverse is what got me hooked onto scifi. Loved the idea and attention to detail. Great as an audio book as well.
14443,best romantic novel,"In no particular order:

\-Well Met

\-Beach Read

\-A Duke by Default

\-A Prince on Paper

\-Pride and Prejudice"
50866,best rap album,My favourites are Kanye - MBDTF and Kendrick - GKMC.
4959,best home improvement store,"Much of the time I go to my Loweâ€™s they are out of stock of the same items they have been out of stock for the last 8 months. (Like, do they ever take inventory?) Also the lumber is crap there, itâ€™s like they never cull any of the picked through crappy lumber and just hope some unexpecting person will eventually buy it. At Home Depot I find what I need generally and the lumber is much better."
100,best terminal file manager reddit,"Sometimes all you have available is the CLI; just last week I had a user on a Linux box that couldn't delete some folder with a weird name that had a bunch of strange extended characters that I couldn't delete using rm and tab completion. Maybe I could have done it if I spent more time, but mc was able to zap it without any complaint."
56505,best desktop monitor,"Unless you're using Freesync or G-Sync, not reaching your monitor's refresh rate will always look stuttery because of the uneven frametimes. It's not entirely due to the lower average framerate compared to 75fps on a 75hz monitor.

Basically, when displaying 57 out of 75 frames, some have to be repeated. Because of this, every second you're seeing 39 frames once and 18 frames twice (39+18+18 = 75). Each of those 39 frames lasts 13.3 ms, while the other 18 last 26.6 ms.

On the other hand, with 60fps on a 60hz monitor each frame always lasts 16.6 ms (no stutter)."
2508,best headphones,"I was going to say.. There's a bunch of Sonys from $50-80 just as good/better than ""beats"" or something."
67386,axios alternatives reddit,Axios usually. Sometimes fetch for easy caching in pwas
46103,best trick or treating candy,"Nope, try again.

As an Aussie I donâ€™t fall into any of these, because itâ€™s all bullshit"
36964,best roller coaster at six flags,"The problem wouldn't happen now. I went at a different time. Superman was closed because of Lex Luthor being built. Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus weren't built yet. Tatsu broke down while we were in line. X2, the ride I was most looking forward to, was incredibly rough, music wasnt working, and was in no way pleasant. Scream is one of my least favorite coasters. Aside from RR and Apocalypse, everything else I found to be mediocre. Very dissapointing visit."
1396,best ice cream flavor,MINT CHOCOLATE BEST ICE CREAM FLAVOR
34913,best NFL player,Do yourself a favor and keep an eye out for him if you ever are forced to watch Cincy this seaso.  Dude is smart as hell and was pretty easily the best FS in the game last year.
72121,best movies with a cool twist,Repomen was pretty mind fuck to me
61827,Best RPG game on PS4,"This is how I felt about Nier: Automata. I felt a bit bad, because I tried my best to like it, to understand it and to go and emphasize the hype aroudn it - but in the end, after ending C - I really did not like the game and those endings did not make anything extraordinary to experience.
 It is an OK game, imho, with a bit of tedious things to do, for you to see the greatest ending."
27289,best stocks to buy,"MSFT didn't really move all that much from 2000-2013.  Granted the dot com burst and GFC didn't help, but if you purchase MSFT in 2003, you wouldn't have doubled your money until 2015 (not including dividends)"
57947,best cologne,Roma by Laura Biagiotti. Burberry London is a close second.
20893,best workout music,"Patiently Waiting with 50 & Em aswell.


And ofc, the legendary ""cant be touched"" by Roy Jones Jr."
62750,Best Data Science textbook,"He may say that he shouldn't be praised so highly but that's not apparent from his book in which he goes on and on about how great his models are. Sure they may drive traffic and aren't publishing *per se* but that doesn't lessen the criticism that there is reason to doubt the rigor of the team's modeling efforts.

To your second point, sure I agree that his model worked ""best"" and likewise I will never say that 538 does a worse job than nearly any other agency but what I'm saying is that statistics isn't about being overconfident or ""conservative"", it's about being appropriately certain because your model is appropriate based upon concrete priors about the structure of the system in question and being certain about the structure of your uncertainty (and being transparent about it all the while). Like I said before, I'm not sure that Nate Silver really understands statistics beyond the introductory level because I've not seen any evidence to refute my intuition."

27548,best bollywood actor,yep.. big time..
62228,Best RPG game on PS4,">Start an island/story quest, then do everything on said island/land including exploration, side quests, and the story quest up to and including overthrowing the leader and fighting the battle. Then move to next land/island and repeat. 

You don't actually have to do all that though. If you only do some sidequests in-between the main story you shouldn't have to grind any levels or anything. You can also just pick up all contracts in every town you visit. You will automatically finish them by just playing the game and they give you a lot of experience for free. You don't even have to go out of your way to turn them in, as soon as you finish the objective (stuff like kill 30 spartan soldiers, sink 5 athenian ships, kill 15 bandits..), it automatically awards you experience and money."
