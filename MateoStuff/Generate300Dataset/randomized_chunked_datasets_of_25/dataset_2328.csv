5907,best programming language for web development,"In this day and age, I would absolutely recommend learning JavaScript if your goal is to become a web developer. More and more the browser is becoming sort of like a thin-client for cloud services, and JS is the language that browsers understand. Currently, there is also a huge surge in popularity of building native (and native-like mobile websites) with React Native (a popular JS library), and the technology in that space is just getting better.

If you're thinking about doing mostly backend web development, you could get away with minimal html/css/js knowledge but if you're wanting to build any sort of modern web app, you'll need JavaScript."
