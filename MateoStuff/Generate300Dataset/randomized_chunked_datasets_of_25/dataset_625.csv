62075,Best RPG game on PS4,"Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made. Nothing else from this generation even comes close. Except for the legendary edition of mass effect if you wanna count that. Both of those are absolute must plays, light-years ahead of half the games you listed. You won't regret it"

56518,best desktop monitor,"Well your limiting factor is going to be the 4gb vram on the gpu. If you do go for 1440p you will need to make sure to turn things that use high vram down such as textures. In terms of fps it really depends on the games you play. Do you play newer or older games? Newer games will push your gpu (and to a somewhat lesser extent cpu) quite a bit seeing as your gpu is made for 1080p gaming. Look up benchmarks for the 580 4gb (and see what cpu they are using for the benchmark to) and see what frames they get for the games they tested. If the frames achieved are what you desire then go for it. 
In the end though I will say 1080p 144hz unless you are trying to “futureproof” your monitor will probably be the way to go. But I don’t want to make the decision for you."
5172,best home improvement store,"For whatever reason, I’m able to find the things I want/need at HD better than Lowes. And I disagree on the return policy in regards to HD. My husband returns things long after the return date and often without receipt generally without fuss. We just end up with store credit that we’ll probably spend on our way out the door.

Lowes also don’t seem to always be located nearby. The HD is 10 minutes down the road from my house. The closest Lowes is currently 30+ minutes in either direction. It’s just not very convenient."
