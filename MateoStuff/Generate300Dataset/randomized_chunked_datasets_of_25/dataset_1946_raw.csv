"If you’re gonna do that, you should also include france’s euros stat as well, just for a fairer comparison."
Ed O'neill. Met him on a shoot for a remake of Dragnet... awesome dude.

"Try the Bon Appetit ""best pizza"" recipes.  I've been using sourdough so you let it ferment for 3-5 days for best flavor."
I love VS code but I have had issues with using it for large files. If I open certain files in VS code it will freeze. I have to switch to atom and open the file there which is pretty frustrating
"Always getting caught on the needlessly absolute statements lol.

Elite schools cater to the socio-political elites, if for no other reason that for those institutions’ formative years and for most of the time since those are the only people who could realistically attend. It’s ingrained. These people tend to be “conservative” (in the “lower taxes for the wealthy, get government contracts for my family’s industry” sort of way) out of self-interest. Harvard, the Ivy League in general, and similar schools produce these people out of both their culture and likely due to simple inertia.

Even highly respected schools with less entrenched history like UC Berkeley, UCLA, Michigan, Virginia, etc. aren’t quite at the same level of educating the political elite. Not sure how or if we should punish elite schools for this, but there’s a reason so many political elite attend or send their kids to Harvard or Yale."
Tenet. I felt it could have used more downtime between all the action.
"Thanks for that link. Zebra is very nice, wish it had dark mode tho lol"
"This is 2 weeks later, but I just wanted to also comment on keeping your books.  I had an account from when Audible was brand new... like 1999 or 2000.. any ways I only had an account for about a year. I have not reactivated it since.  

I still listen to books from that account to this day. over 10 years since I canceled it."
Seems about right.
Driveclub with season pass for single player. For online I have no clue.
"I mainly play cello because it has my favorite timbre and range, with no frets allowing an ultimate level of expression, that few instruments have. But for composing, piano, and that's why I've been practicing piano so much."
Yeah that’s the one.
"Slight correction: iPhone 11 too uses intel modem,exactly same as XR.It’s only the 12 series which uses Qualcomm’s X55 5G modem"
"I don't know much about job prospects, but many (maybe all) universities with agricultural programs offer an ""agribusiness"" degree. You should look in to it."

These are deadly and delicious. They are named after an artillery piece.
"That was one of the few films that had my jaw on the ground and left me stunned silent at the end of it. Not just the twist, but how close it could be to reality in the near future"
"I mean, I think if I wanted to increase my chances of getting an offer I'd do that by first obtaining the work visa to go look in-person, as I could almost certainly do for the Netherlands, Australia, or Canada. (Yes, I've read all the rules). But, that wasn't what I was asking here. It's always interesting to me when people just assume strangers haven't done research."
"Why? Assembly *can* be used in WebDev. [This website](http://gilliscoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/women-laughing-4.jpg) is written entirely in assembly, front and backend."
