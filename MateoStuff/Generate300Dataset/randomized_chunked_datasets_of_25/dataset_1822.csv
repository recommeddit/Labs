33807,best Pokemon game,"The best for me would be Platinum. People complain about Sinnoh having only played DP. Platinum added a bunch onto DP and none of it was bad. And DP was pretty good as well. Platinum wasn't necessarily the best in any individual aspects, but all around is the best for me and has few issues (just the saving time and the HP bar taking years to go down).

The worst is Sw/Sh. I don't really want to explain why."
47106,best state to visit in the United States,"Keep in mind Chicago is really big, area-wise, compared to a lot of other major cities. You'll probably need to rent a car there."
22722,best celebrity,"Regis.

I think I was like 7 or 8 and my family was on vacation at Disney world. My mom bought me an autograph book at one of the souvenir shops so I could get all the characters to sign it. I was having the best time collecting all these signatures and thought it was SO cool.

Anyway, our hotel room was located on a concierge floor which is basically a floor with a 24 hr buffet on it (you pay extra for the perk and have to use your key in the elevator to get to the floor. My dad was a big corp exec at the time, which allowed us some expensive shit, don't judge.)

So we were up there one morning having our breakfast as usual and I spot Regis across the room drinking coffee and reading the paper. Apparently ""Live"" was doing shows there all week. I start to freak out like the little school girl I was and asked my mom if I could go over and get his autograph. She of course said yes.

So I pretty much skip over there, my heart ready to explode with excitement. I get to his table, hold out my book and say, ""Excuse me Mr. Regis, can I have your autograph?""

He peered over his paper at me and said words that crushed my tiny little spirit and hardened me for life - ""Scram kid. I'm having my coffee.""

Fuck Reg."

47775,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"**IMPORTANT:**
---

Make sure your school allows graphing calculator on exams before buying one!
---

Check with your instructor.  As much as Texas Instruments pushes their graphing calculators, my school (a community college that bases their course requirements on local 4-year schools) doesn't allow graphing calculators on exams **at all*.  That's for Algebra 1, 2, Pre-Calc, Calc 1, 2, and 3, and I'm told even Differential Equations.  [Here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K/) of a non-graphing, scientific calculator that's allowed in all classes and exams.  (Except for my Chem 101 class which for some reason only allows [this disaster of a calculator](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-TI-30Xa-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B00000JBNS/).)  Note that a [very similar but slightly more advanced version](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-Engineering-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B004NBZB2Y/) of the first one I linked was explicitly *not* allowed by two instructors because of the poly-solv and sys-solv functions, though this appears to vary by instructor."
20348,best workout music,"My favorite edm songs are left behinds - Paris blohm and raveology - DVBBS 

[This is my favorite nightcore song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Fg7KSJDK8) but if you’re mainly into hip hop I doubt you’ll like this sub genre. It’s super fast paced sped-up music (so it also is generally accompanied by a high pitched voice)."
64497,Best Nike running shoes,"That is a great guide and I have enjoyed your articles in the past.  

I do not think I will ever buy nike running products again due to their treatment of track and field athletes, exemplified by the current legal action taken on Boris Berian.  I was a big nike running fan, but I have a hard time with how they conduct themselves."

3227,best webcamera,I have that same cam. I love it. It’s my face cam and has done well for me. If you do get it there are a few tips I can share with you for balancing the washout that can happen with lighting. It’s a solid cam though
6710,best iPhone,"I’m a fan small phones

41147,best instrument to play,"Not meant to be, it's the truth.  Maybe he'll be one of those adults who does learn an instrument proficiently, but they tend to be white elephants."
37868,best Marvel movie,"Yeah, look around the MCU sub, where we all love and hype whatever is new? Haha, I said that this film is fucking great, and is definitely a banger. I loved it! But this sub DOES tend to put whatever is new and fresh as ""top 5"". As stated before, TFatWS was being praised as ""best of the MCU"" on here.  

And especially since the OP said ""Marvel movie"" and not ""MCU movie"", that could also include movies like Logan, Deadpool, Spider-Man 2, ITSV, DoFP, etc. and uhh... kinda hard to rank Shang-Chi among *Logan-*tier lol"

45661,best trick or treating candy,"Candy Corn sisters unite! I especially love the Autumn mixes and the Mellow creams, ummmm."
18056,best Kardashian,"Yes also to add to my comment, kim and kris have taught me a lot and have even helped me negotiate office politics at work. Like how kim keeps her cool and doesnt fight back (for example like when that interviewer was hella passive aggressive with her in a post someone else shared earlier today). Kris gives everyoneee in her staff niceee presents. The karjenners always look neat from head to toe like with clean hair and a styled outfit even when in sweats. 

Ya a lot of what they do is superficial, but remaining professional when you’re still climbing the fame/corporate ladder, treating everyone below you (as in your subordinates) kindly, and looking polished are important things that i wish my own mother had taught me.

Also i know kris sometimes gets tough with her employees like even steph shep has said that, but that’s also taught me to have a thicker skin when others are tough and to be more self aware so that i dont come off mean."
25460,best cricket teams of all time,"while this isn't true in anyone on here's lifetime, england historically have a lot of batsman who average 56-60 over 40+ tests. not sure if it's enough to beat bradman + the five best other australian batters though. bradman is basically two world class batsman in one."
