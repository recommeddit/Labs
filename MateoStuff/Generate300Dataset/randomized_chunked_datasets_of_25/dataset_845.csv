12895,best gifts for mom,"My mother is the mom of me (29) and my brother (32) who lives at home, does no chores, pay no bills and as I found out during a very long and frank convo with her a couple months ago, is a gigantic source of stress for her and my father. She told me that some days she ""just wants to get away."" She shared this with other moms at her job and they all agreed with her, but their children are much younger. So I've decided to take her out for a getaway. Get her the hell out of the house for a day of whatever she wants just so she doesn't have to clean up after 2 grown men. She's very excited."

46494,best trick or treating candy,"Western PA here. Can throw a stone over the border.

Never seen Mars on Halloween before either."
4901,best home improvement store,Lowe's for plumbing parts and lights.  Home depot for pretty much everything else. I prefer hd paint by a large margin as well as their electrical. I also like ace hardware a lot. If it matters I've been shopping in one of those stores a minimum of once a week for the last 20 years.
32886,best energy drink,"Ngl probably G-FUEL, lots of different flavours and a decent value for money. I like Red Bull and a few Monsters, but if G-FUEL was able to just be bought in shops here or without horrendous shipping I'd buy it way more."
4964,best home improvement store,Hard to find someone to help or find someone that actually knows anything ?

19613,best YouTube video,Hands down the video I go to that makes me laugh so damn hard no matter how shitty of a day I've had.
6511,best Netflix documentary,"This is a must watch for anyone who hasn’t. I actually live in Toronto, so I was here when all that stuff was going down but to hear the back story blew my mind lol. Not to mention the amazing story telling all through out."
3731,best college for research,"Dude, nice idea, but your data is kinda funny. Im latinamerican and I can tell you that at least Argentina, Chile and Peru look weird. If U Antofagasta (I guess) is there, at least UBA and Catholic University of Peru should also be there."
64839,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Didn’t sambos reopen ?
38517,best newspapers to read,"I used to read the paper a lot and even convinced my parents to upgrade from a Sunday to an everyday subscription when I was a kid. Now I'll only occasionally read the paper, usually if one's around and I'm not especially busy.

The internet just makes news far too convenient."

20514,best workout music,Icky Thump
73025,best Linux distro,What do you guys think about kodachi as a security distro? Based on my web search it's kinda mixed. Topics on reddit for security distro is pretty outdated. And parrot sec reddit community hasn't posted over a year. I guess the first rule of Parrot Sec. is that you don't talk about it.
62751,Best Data Science textbook,"I don’t know. I get what you’re saying about opaque methodology but it seems silly to suggest that someone who has an Econ degree, does better predictive political modeling than most, and does decent predictive sports modeling only has an introductory grasp on statistics."
4619,best text editor,"9 times out of 10, it's either in Eclipse or IntelliJ."
5876,best programming language for web development,"> The website I have in mind would be a fairly simple one with functionality for logging in, downloading files from it and so on, fairly simple stuff.  

Creating a login system involves many new concepts for beginners; I would describe it more as 'intermediate' than simple. To implement this yourself, you will need to learn about databases and SQL, HTTP, how cookies work, etc. I don't mean to deter you (there are lots of resources to help you!), only to paint a more clear picture of what's involved. 

Is your goal to build this one website? If yes, stick to what you know (Java, C#). If you're interested in building more websites or a career in web development, strongly consider learning NodeJS (i.e. javascript). As others have said, start with HTML and CSS, of course."
