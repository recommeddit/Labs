12895,"My mother is the mom of me (29) and my brother (32) who lives at home, does no chores, pay no bills and as I found out during a very long and frank convo with her a couple months ago, is a gigantic source of stress for her and my father. She told me that some days she ""just wants to get away."" She shared this with other moms at her job and they all agreed with her, but their children are much younger. So I've decided to take her out for a getaway. Get her the hell out of the house for a day of whatever she wants just so she doesn't have to clean up after 2 grown men. She's very excited.",best gifts for mom

5876,"> The website I have in mind would be a fairly simple one with functionality for logging in, downloading files from it and so on, fairly simple stuff.  

Creating a login system involves many new concepts for beginners; I would describe it more as 'intermediate' than simple. To implement this yourself, you will need to learn about databases and SQL, HTTP, how cookies work, etc. I don't mean to deter you (there are lots of resources to help you!), only to paint a more clear picture of what's involved. 

Is your goal to build this one website? If yes, stick to what you know (Java, C#). If you're interested in building more websites or a career in web development, strongly consider learning NodeJS (i.e. javascript). As others have said, start with HTML and CSS, of course.",best programming language for web development
