It's those feathers on a bird's head that go woosh! when they stand up.
It has no wobble at all when pressing the corners? Or is it just reduced wobble?
"Lots of good food in SB so you really can't go wrong. Definitely go to Los Agaves. Lama Dog in the Funk Zone for craft beer, good food, great environment. Arigato is legit sushi but yeah, pricey. Yume Sushi is also downtown and has equally phenomenal sushi without the price tag and long lines. Olio E Limone and Olio Pizzeria are both fantastic. Bouchon is probably the best restaurant in town, but pricey. Ca Dario is a bomb Italian restaurant for less than Olio."
"I recommend The Money Store, especially “Get Got”"
I don’t think they were broken up but there’s a lot of people definitely theorizing that they were broken up and that this whole mess was an excuse to publicly break up🧐
It's the most sensible answer I can think of

"A bit different from the rest, but I really like Dataclysm by Christian Rudder and The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Tufte. 

The first is a great example of presenting data well to an audience not familiar with the subject matter and the second is a great help when designing visualizations."
"As someone who’s horrible at making their own decisions, this definetly helps, thanks man 😭🤞🏽"
"Imagine being a kid or a moviegoer that had no real idea about the comics or much about thanos or infinity war beyond it being an avengers movie. That twist is hella shocking then isn’t it! 

For this generation of kids this is their mufasa moment, the toys in the garbage disposal moment, their ash ketchum dying moment. This shit is traumatising in the best way!"
"Let's not forget the reason he hated Britain, (and why Britain actually hated him) HE WAS FRENCH"
So kickers aren't players? wtf?
"Coldstone's Cake Batter ice cream.
...Am I fired now?"
"X2 > Twisted Colossus > Tatsu > Lex Luthor > Batman > Scream > Riddler's > Full Throttle > Crazanity > Goliath. 

The rest is either closed or kinda mild."
Kon-Tiki is pretty adventurous.
"He says he’s busy with school/college, will upload soon (whatever soon means)."
Is it possible to view my spending in categories?
"""Treasure Island"". That is an adventure to the highest degree."
Persona 5 (Royal) and Nier Automata are my two favourite games on the PS4
Any thoughts on Miyake D'issey?
Thank you! I'm moving into a new house in 3 weeks and this is going to be my best friend pretty soon!
Yeah I was checking out all three and BFT sounds and looks like the coolest one in my opinion
What the hell?! Yikes that's just.. That's super gross lmao. Did she pick it up? Was it an accident?
"This is probably my current/recent top 5:

* **2312** by Kim Stanley Robinson: rambly, ambitious, and with lots of flowery descriptions of nature, 2312 was the book that got me back into sci-fi big time after a long period of not being able to finish a book.
* **Habitat** by Simon Roy: a short graphic novel about a collapsed civilization in a satellite colony going to war over a single 3D printed laser gun. A must-read for sci-fi fans.
* **Frankenstein** by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein is the most relatable college art student in all of fiction. The first and most famous science fiction novel, yet its still somehow underrated.
* **Draco Tavern** by Larry Niven: Niven is an old favorite who I've sort outgrown, but Draco Tavern is a fun collection where he leans heavily on his greatest strength, writing tons of wacky aliens.
* **The Word for World is Forest** by Ursula Le Guin: Le Guin's post-Vietnam anti-war novella where she invents Ewoks 10 years early and rages against libertarian army bros is just as cathartic and necessary all these years later."
Yeah your right. I do have an attachment with Cydia. And whatever the case I won’t let go of Cydia. But I do keep sileo and would also keep zebra with it. Is it possible to keep all 3 of em though.
