53721,"I understand this thread is deliberately asking for evidence-free magic potions. But given there's already plenty of bullshit masquerading as science (and it's a slow day), thought I'd post some evidence-based medical advice about treatment of a common cold just in case. All of the below is entirely evidence based (citation if required).

'The common cold' is the term given for upper respiratory tract infections caused by one of many similar viruses.

* An adult has roughly 2-3 colds a year. Children have significantly more.

* All of the following symptoms are entirely common and in keeping with having a cold: runny nose, mild fever, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache, tiredness, feeling run down.

* The cold typically lasts for upto 7-11 days (longer in people who smoke or have lung disease). If symptoms persist past this point, then it might indicate a post-cold sequelae, another illness, or a concurrent bacterial illness.

**TREATMENTS:** 


* As a cold is a viral illness, antibiotics have no place in their treatment. They will not reduce the length of a cold, nor make you feel better, nor prevent complications. Even using the colour of the runny nose is not an effective determinant of whether antibiotics are required.

* There has been a small study of intranasal antivirals for the cold which showed that it did improve symptoms and reduce mucus production in one to three quarters of patients, but it was associated with increased drowsiness and really hasn't been tested rigorously enough.

* No vitamin supplements or herbal product has been proven effective in treatment of the cold (including Vitamin C and echinacea)

* Zinc in intranasal and lozenge forms has some evidence in reducing symptoms of cold, however it is NOT recommended due to question marks around toxicity, safety and permanent anosmia (loss of smell sense).

* Intranasal Inhaled steroids have no effect in improving cold symptoms or reducing length of illness (unlike there proven effectiveness in hayfever and similar conditions).

* Cough syrups. Antitussives - there is no clear benefit to symptoms for the use of codeine based cough suppressants in the acute phase of a cold (although there's a greater role in post-cold cough syndromes and chronic coughs). Expectorants - There is a tiny body of evidence that using an expecteroant helps relieve cold-related cough symptoms. 

* Decongestants. Both pseudoephidrine and phenylephrine have been shown to improve congestive symptoms of a cold. Pseudoephidrine is more effective than phenylephrine. Oral tablets should be used cautiously in older people and people with cardiovascular risk factors, topical treatments should only be used for a few days to avoid producing further cold-like symptoms when they are ceased (rebound rhinitis).

* Antihistamines are possibly of some benefit, although the general consensus of the available evidence is that they have a high incidence of side effects for every symptoms they improve.

* Intranasal cromolyn sodium and ipatropium bromide both have evidence that they can reduce the severity and duration of the nasal symtpoms of a cold.

* Relief of sore throat and fever is best achieved through paracetamol/acetaminophen. Aspirin is also effective. NSAIDs can also be used, however they are best indicated for pain (as opposed to other cold symptoms) and should be used cautiously in older patients, renal patients and cardiovascular patients.

* There's reasonably evidence that nasal saline washes can help mucus clearance and thus provide symtpomatic relief (albeit for short time spans).

**PREVENTION:**

* There is no clear evidence for the role of vitamin C in prevention of colds. The exception to this is people who are exposed to cold weather under rigorous exertion conditions (working in the arctic, marathon runners in winter etc.)

* Zinc has evidence that it can reduce the incidence of colds in children. There is no indication this is true in adults. Long-term zinc use can lead to loss of sense of smell.

* There is debatable evidence that moderately-rigorous exercise (5 x a week) led to fewer colds and milder symptoms. There is no clear evidence for minimal exercise (one or two times a week) have a similar effect

* There is no evidence for use of Vit D, Vit E, echinacea, garlic, probiotics or face masks in preventing colds.
