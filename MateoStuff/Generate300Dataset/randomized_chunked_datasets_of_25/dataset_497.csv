27125,"I tend to agree with SU&SD more on this one. Terraforming Mars is, to me, a pretty mediocre engine builder, with a good bit of luck determining who does well. Shut Up and Sit Down has a razor-sharp focus on finding the ""hook"" or the really unique game concept that makes the game a keeper. Terraforming Mars' ""hook"" isn't a mechanic or game element, it is the science-oriented fantasy of slowly carving an entire planet to your will. I think that appeals to a lot of people, including many reviewers, but I think SU&SD would say that the emperor has no clothes.",best board games

67559,"If you don't even bump your dependency library versions (i.e. `node-fetch`), it's going to get stuck behind in major versions.

e.g. `node-fetch` is on v2.6, but in `isomorphic-fetch`, the version specified by `""node-fetch"": ""^1.0.1""` EXCLUDES any 2.0 version of `node-fetch`. Now *that's* horribly outdated.

Yes, it's essentially a single line package, but if you wanna use and/or write a package, doing it this way is just begging for security holes.",axios alternatives reddit

Oh yeah i definitely won't be done with Gundam after UC lol, ty for recommendation.

27105,"> why SU&SD was off the mark?  

I think the key ""tilt"" that SUSD have relative to many other reviewers is the centrality for them of the question, ""is this game a fun way to interact with my friends?"" ie, not, ""is this game a fantastic puzzle to work out (with my friends nearby also working on a similar puzzle)?"" but, is the game good for *enhancing* the interaction between the people at the table?  

You can see this in how strongly they advocate for **Blood on the Clocktower** or **The King's Dilemma** or **Wavelength** or even **Kakerlaken Poker**. Lightweight or heavyweight, all these games are very interactive.  

Terraforming Mars is kinda multiplayer-solitaire-esque. Lots of people really really like games that fit this description, and there's nothing wrong with this type of design. But these games are never going to get a strong response from the SUSD people because that's not where their focus is.",best board games
