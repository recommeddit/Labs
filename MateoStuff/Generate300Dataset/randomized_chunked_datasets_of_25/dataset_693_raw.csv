Those Brony's sure know how to party.
Lava Hot Springs is also a fun place to spend the 4th of July. I grew up in southern Idaho and my friends and I would go there for the fireworks and the Thai restaurant.
"No, electric cars are highly susceptible to load and drag."
No it appears that this is just a discussion of the documentary and the war itself. The Ken Burns Vietnam documentary is a 10 part series with episodes being between 90 and 120 minutes each.
Nier is a great game too
I subscribe to my local paper because it's has the best coverage of local news.

I was absolutely addicted to it
"I agree.  I don't know why they made that movie.  That line of comics was seriously unpopular with fans.

When I found that out, I no longer held that against Andrew Garfield.  He has been perfect in everything else he was in.  He was awesome in the Social Network.  He made the whole story human, and relatable."

Thanks for the help! I’ll check this one out.

">Simpsons Hit and Run is actually pretty good on PC.

Thanks for bringing that to my attention! I wasn't aware it was also available on PC.  However it looks like a copy is around $30 but there might be cheaper copies available on ebay.  It's really up to the consumer if it's worth it :)

Ninja Edit: You also could be right about TimeSplitters 3 being superior.  I didn't get a chance to play that one, and I think I may have mixed those two games up in terms of critical acclaim.  I will be sure to add that to the list!"

"The first time I saw it I was Blown Away. 

I've dabbled with video editing and regularly edit Audio for work but this was on such another level. I can't even imagine how many hours went into both the audio and the video."
SO good
"Let's not forget Erwin Chargaff, who felt snubbed as well. Paraphrased - it is late in the day when such pygmies cast such long shadows.

"You know who gave full sized candy bars, and not just that, but goodie bags with multiple full sized candy bars?  John fucking Madden's wife that's who.  He was probably traveling to do his next game and wasn't there but his wife was and she was the nicest, coolest lady I have ever met.  She was even dressed up.  I got so much candy from her I didn't bother trying to go back for a second time.  


I never lived near them but one of my friends growing up did so I went to the rich neighborhood to do my trick or treating.  If you ever have the chance to do this for your kids  do it"
"There is no fucking way that Kendrick Lamar is better than the Wu-Tang Clan. I mean c'mon, they've been around for nearly 30 fucking years, Kendrick Lamar has only been around half that long and in a few years he'll be back in the ""No one gives a shit"" category while Wu-Tang will still be remembered 50 years from now.

It'd be like comparing Jinjer to fuckin' Metallica."
"Infinity War is surely entertaining and works well as a Thanos movie. But if you look at it like an Avengers movie, it doesn't have much substantial development for the heroes. I love it and it is my second fav film, but I can see why critics didn't love it as much. 

It focussed mainly on action-spectacle. To give you an example by exaggeration, some of them saw it as a Transformers like movie in the MCU. It's also because the breakneck pace of the movie never allows it to delve deep into emotions - it's mainly thrills and shock factor."
