Thor 2 lol
Yeah the audience score is way more reliable. Sometimes I feel with rotten tomatoes that they have random movie critics review them and not actual fans of the franchise. Like black panther is good and all but would any true marvel fan have it absolute number one? (Some tru fans  obviously have too but I mean in general)

Charles Barkley.  He was the grand opening of the casino hotel in which I work. He was very friendly and funny.
I don’t disagree with you in the interim… which is why I said “once the batteries are replaced”.
"There are like 20 brands out there, some even like I said are a ""band"" not even floss. Some are re-usable, you just change the roll of floss so the handle is a lot sturdier than the disposable version. Shop around a bit! Or eat celery after each meal, whatever!"
"A SuperPAC, unfortunately."
That was the plan :)
Knott's is pretty high on the list of theme parks I'd say
"Yes, yes, yes. 1000x YES!!"
I've been wearing it for almost 10 now. It's so light and refreshing! I just can't even look at anything else lol
"I remember seeing a video of someone testing each bottles water for different minerals, chemicals, additives, ph levels etc. it was actually really fascinating. If I recall correctly, Dasani was pretty bad."
"Selfie cams are rarely attached to $1000 phones, because most people dont buy those models."
For me the best part about the roar is the firstdrop after that the ride seems really rough.
"Not the OP, but for me it's the matter of price. I'm can't afford to get shoes from specialty running store, but with Nike I can get decent pair of running shoes for half the price, maybe even less. I go almost exclusively to Nike factory store, and my last shoes Downshifter 6  and Winflo 3 cost me $30 and $65 respectively. 

Once I'm more financially stable I'd like to try different shoes like the Asics gel series or some New balance or others. For now though, my Nike's are treating me well, and are affordable."
"Definitely [Dreamhost](https://reddlink.tech/dreamhost). Solid cheap hosting, very affordable domains, etc. Don't go with Siteground, they're scammy."

Burt's bees toothpaste with novamin in the afternoon and Clinpro at night. Soft bristled manual brush.
"Its a nice scent but I dont know why would anyone want to make it their signature scent since literally everyone wears it. I smell it everywhere all the time,  on the subway, in stores etc. 2 women in my office wear it too."
"Leap Into an Open Grave: 

1 shot vodka, 2 shots Pernod, 1 shot Baileys, 1 shot Poteen, Pineapple juice, a raw egg, and a dash of mint."
"I have NVDA, COST, ENB, AQN and Lucid because i'm still -25% on that one"
