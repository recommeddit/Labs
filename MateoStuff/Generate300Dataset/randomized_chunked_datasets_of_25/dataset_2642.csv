3930,I took a course online through a local college while working full time. I didn't end up completing the course for other reasons but I had a great experience. I was able to contact instructors at any time and could study and complete my work when I saw fit. All of the course material was provided and we had regular chat room sessions with instructors and other students in the same program to make sure we were all on the same page. If you're someone who can keep yourself on task and get yourself to complete assignments on your own then an online course might work for you. However if you need a classroom environment and an instructor lecturing to you and keeping you on task then I don't recommend it.,best online college

5221,"In my case, it is because the search on home depots website, while still terrible, is less terrible than the search on lowes. Lowes search, even if I know the model number or partial name, will frequently give me zero results. In addition, the tool section at my local lowes is lettered (A,B,C etc.) whereas the website lists aisle number and bay numbers... As a result, anytime I try to buy tools/tool accessories I have to ask an employee for help to find it. As the bay numbers and letters do not match in any way shape or form.",best home improvement store

PLTR - My most likely pick of the next Apple 

Sofi - Legacy bank killer. I sat at a stop light for about a minute and watched like 9 people walk into a US Bank…. I kept thinking “Why are these people still walking into a bank!!?”

CPNG - A lot of people are going to disagree with me, but I like this company to dominate, kinda similar to SE. I initiated a position in CPNG on Friday, as the stock has gone nowhere but down. I’m calling a bottom. Alibaba drama should be a massive tailwind here",best stocks to buy
