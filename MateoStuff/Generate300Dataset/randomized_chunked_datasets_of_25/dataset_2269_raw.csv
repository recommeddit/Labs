"Thank you, that's sad indeed...I don't want to spend 500 on a samsung/apple tablet just to annotate papers!"
You can never be *too* cautious.
"Make tea. add juice of half a lemon, lots of raw honey, and a bit of fresh sliced ginger. Symptoms always disappear 50% faster for me than for my friends/coworkers because I use the good ole lemon tea method. I also get a good boost of energy from it, so if I am at home sick and I need to check in with work and answer emails or anything I'll drink the tea right before hand to clear my head. Works like a charm. It's important that the honey is raw, because processed honey loses a lot of its health benefits. If you can get local raw honey at the farmers market, drinking some tea with a tbs of local raw honey can also really help with seasonal allergies (again it has to be local). 

You can also make [SnakeJuice](http://themilkmanswife.blogspot.com/2009/02/homemade-couh-syrup.html) which tastes terrible but works even better than just lemon and honey."

Seconded Bagel Cafe! Get out there during summer or before 10am on a Sunday and you'll probably avoid many of the college crowd.

"The Economist is insanely biased. You Americans would probably call it libertarian. In general, the Economist promotes deregulation of everything: from marriage to business.

It's still some of the most well written, thoroughly researched English-language journalism out there - but biased as hell."
"I might have a slight bias, but Chicago rocks."
"Aside of the fact that expansions give variety that is soon appreciated after playing base game for a few games, they also allow for more interesting combo's that are not present in the base game.

Its a game that is good with base but really shines with at least 1 expansion."
"I quit my career, put a few things in storage and thru hiked the AT in 2014.  Best decision I ever made."
"Iron Maiden, Kendrick Lamar, WWE theme songs"
"I have been using personal capital not very long, but I really like the interface and budgeting tool. It’s free, but I’m still getting things updated with my bills changing and some items being marked as a certain category when it should be something else. Just fine tuning basically. So far, I’m motivated to use it."
"Yes ""praying"" is the key part! Pray all day and night and you will be cured. Hallelujah!!"
Weeds!  (seriously one of my favourites).  I know it's on Amazon Prime
"LOTR I would not really class as an action adventure, more fantasy adventure. 

I agree most are action, solely but some do have a great sense of travel and excitement"
"That $35 bidet from Amazon, and never use toilet paper again."
