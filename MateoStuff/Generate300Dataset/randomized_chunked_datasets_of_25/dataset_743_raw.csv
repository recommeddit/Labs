A: No.  Why:  Because the last thing I need is another chemical vice.  My battles with nicotine and caffeine (in coffee form) are quite enough.
Will you enlighten me?

"As much as I want to say ""you can play all those HD remakes on an emulator"", I have to say Final Mixes introduced a non-trivial amount of improvement to Kingdome Hearts and since I can't read Japanese, I can stand buying the HD ReMIX"
but then you had another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend who wore Acqua Di Gio
Another two great platforms. Thanks you so much for sharing to the community.
Where can you get a decent keyboard for less than 100 $?
"Christ. I know what he meant, just the way he phrased it was odd...."
"Well, I have specifically mentioned in the OP that I am aware of the site. But I guess I can look again?

:P"
"Yes. Without a doubt Bandit by Robert Piguet is the greatest perfume ever created. I've smelled and tried virtually all that is to be smelled out there, including discontinued expensive rarities such as Bal a Versailles, and while many are great, nothing even comes close to the olfactory masterpiece that is Bandit."
"I didn't, I perceive San Diego as being more purple than LA or SF"
"True , but I cannot make my code run asynchronously , all JavaScript  I added in the content script would be lost if I click any embedded link. I know in puppeteer we can use async/await and click any link, manipulate Dom, click another link, perform Dom come back to the parent page again etc.."
That takes a special kind of bitch. I hate celebrities that think they're magically above the rest of the population.
"Fougere Gothique is fantastic, but I think I couldn't wear the mushroom scent with confidence. Love the shaving soap tho :)"
"A combination nose hair/ear hair trimmer.

Mom says it's the best present he ever received!"
"The War was inevitable due to border clashes.  

Prior to the American Annexation of Texas; Mexico had invaded Texas at least 2 or 3 times and occupied San Antonio.  

Mexico was struggling with debts to European nations France and the UK. 

Mexico had long standing internal issues prior to the Mexican War and after it through 1919.

The results of the Mexican War contributed to the American Civil War and the South's desire to create more slave states to balance the union.

The American Military was able to decisively defeat the Mexican Army in almost every engagement due to superior leadership and weapon modernization.  The Americans used many modernized Rifled weapons and had more effective artillery."
"Oh Taro is good, my favorite frozen yogurt flavor *by far*."
I bought my dad a beef jerky subscription last year. He still receives monthly packages so I think my answer applies.
"Thank you for your reply, I will try it. I was also maybe thinking of trying installer 5 if that's it's name?"
"The game is great, first three season are on netflix, the other season are on hulu. 

Its quite soap opera like, but they lean into that and make me laugh out loud 3-4 times an episode"
"> ***most*** social media

Yes. Practically everyone in my graduating class does all their ""online"" professional networking via LinkedIn.

The only people I know that deal with Facebook/Instagram/Twitter from a purely professional development perspective are all involved with marketing or sales in some fashion."
Take a look at the Pixio Px7 Prime or the new Px277 Prime (difference with the Px7 and Px277 is the 277 having a 1MS response time). Both are 165hz native and 1440p and I have two Px7 Primes. Runs beautifully with Freesync/Gsync/V-Sync.
"There is no best. Every city has a wide variety of hotels in different locations. One chain does not have a monopoly on the nicest hotels, the best value hotels, or the nicest locations. Each location is generally independently owned and operated. And generally the platinum/elite hotel perks aren't enough to merit exclusivity (unlike airlines).

I prefer Marriott's because they offer good value (especially with the corporate discount codes available) at courtyards and marriotts. JWs internationally are nice and generally affordable. Starwoods are often over priced and offer diminishing returns in terms of value, but offer many more high end options (Westin, W, St. Regis). ICH varies widely-- there are some amazing ICs, but some abysmal holiday inns."
"Went to Portland, OR for a week. Mainly so I could spend 2 days in Halloweentown and meet the movie cast. Childhood won"
