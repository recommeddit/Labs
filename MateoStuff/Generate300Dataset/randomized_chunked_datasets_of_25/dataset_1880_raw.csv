Go to her house and let her take a nap for a few hours while you babysit and help clean up the house.

"I used to drink Rockstars every day. I stopped because I gained a lot of weight. I still drink one once or twice a year probably, but I pretty much stick to coffee since it only has about 4 calories the way I drink it."
