I've played your particular game and I did like it, and even though I'm not choosing this game it's not because I don't think it's good enough or anything like that.

And it comes in pints, so I don't have to share it."
"Same. I'd been told the year before to go buy an expensive toothbrush. Read up on some stuff on the internet and changed my brushing technique, included daily flossing and mouth wash. No issues were found this year!"
"Bought a Peugeot 206 RC a couple years ago, much thanks to me playing with it in NFSU2 as a kid. Lovely car, so much fun to drive."
