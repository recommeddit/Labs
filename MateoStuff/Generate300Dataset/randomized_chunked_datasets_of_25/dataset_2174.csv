22777,best celebrity,"This is inline with my experience with Laurence Fishburne. I waited on him a few times during the filming of Tuskegee Airmen and he was fairly unpleasant. Not as bad as Malcolm Jamal Warner, who is probably the biggest ass I've ever had to deal with, but still. Cuba Gooding Jr, on the other hand, is genuinely nice and very funny."
3012,best webcamera,"The Brio isn't any better image quality wise than the other Logitech cameras. People at the other end don't see the 4K but probably 720p or lower. There's more to image quality than resolution, past 720p its the least important problem for current webcams and the Brio shares all those same problems. 

Webcams don't lock the shutter speed to keep the image smooth they just dump that in the mix with other settings to keep the image bright and it does make the result jerky...all webcams do this not just the Brio."

73745,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Very similar and same satisfying sounds, wouldn't be able to note a difference personally. 

Paperlike is a quality product, I don't think anyone who goes for them should feel they spent too much. I mean we are protecting an expensive item and Paperlike definitely gets the job done."

50752,best rap album,"Nah I’ve listened to way more music this year than 2020+2019 combined. 

It really comes down to being bored. Last year was hectic because I worked in Supply a chain supporting Covid testing. Before last year I had an active social life. 

Now my work is slow and I have nothing going on until places fully open up."

27110,best board games,"The four cards you get for Research Phase are drafted simultaneously (a la 7 Wonders, Sushi Go, etc). Then you pay for each one you want to keep from the four you've drafted. I think a majority of people use this variant, so I think a lot of people will have played that way not knowing that it is a variant."
73326,best Linux distro,"Hey, also a physics uni student here.

Ubuntu or Linux Mint will both suit your needs, as has been said Debian is more advanced.

I expect both Ubuntu and Linux Mint to receive new versions for the foreseeable future, which is to say big mass upgrades every October and April for Ubuntu (I do not know about the Mint release schedule). Get the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version if you want to stay on more or less the same version of all of your software for years on end, which I don't particularly recommend unless you're really averse to change.

You might need to find alternatives to your favorite Windows utilities and programs, but they'll likely be open-source and/or free, which means 1. they won't spy on you and 2. they won't gouge you for money. GIMP instead of Photoshop, Spyder to write Python code, etc. Video games are more or less the only reason I even kept Windows.

As for looks, that's a bit of a rabbit hole.

This might be confusing but bear with me- *your distro does not determine what your operating system looks like.* In Linux, what determines the appearance of your windows, desktop, menus etc. is a bundle of programs called a **desktop environment**.

Regular Ubuntu's desktop environment is GNOME, and Linux Mint's is called, I believe, Cinnamon. Both Ubuntu and Linux Mint also have alternative ""flavors"", which are versions of these distros that are the same under the hood, but with different desktop environments. For example, Ubuntu MATE is Ubuntu under the hood, but it looks very similar to Linux Mint MATE- both use the MATE desktop environment. GNOME is a bit flashier, and honestly quite odd, whereas Cinnamon (default Mint desktop environment) is simpler AFAIK. MATE is even more minimalist I believe.

Also, Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu anyway, so there'll be a lot of overlap regardless of what you pick.

If you ask me... I'd say just go with regular Ubuntu. Most articles, guides etc. aimed at newcomers are designed around Ubuntu (and its GNOME desktop environment), and that'll help you find your way around.

Let me know if you'd like to hear some tips about using Linux for physics, specifically."

41203,best instrument to play,Cornet is basically a trumpet except with conical tubing (similar to the difference between a baritone and euphonium) not basically a flugal horn.

First we have to ship...Portal 2....and then we have to ship...Dota 2."
23569,best car racing video game,"Thank you! Where has this gone from racing games?!

It was the whole driving force (lol) behind Turismo 1-4. I loved starting in the hot-hatch tourneys, tuning that car up so it can win, getting a better car, eventually getting into the rally scene then eventually ending up with super cars and LM race cars. So good.

That and proper points-based tournaments where you can't restart races but if you do well you can sit back and come last in the final race and still win overall."
43791,best items under $100,Had one of these bad boys in college and we would make everything we could put on there when we were drunk. Everyone of my friends ended up buying one too.
41541,best instrument to play,"You need two hands to play any one note on a guitar (aside from open strings). Lesser coordination aside, you only need one finger to play a note on piano. So by default there is much more possibility with a piano, since you can be doing two entirely different melodies/chords at once. Example: you can only play a max 6 notes at once on guitar, while you can play 10+ at a time on piano."
24598,best anime,"Few the most popular and well received shows:

**[Steins;Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7BILZcYAY)**. If you like Sci-Fi you should definitely check. Best time travel show out there with perfectly executed story and subplot romance. Keep in mind that it has slow first half that is very important build up. 

**[Clannad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHdZOKm5xzo) + [Clannad: After Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMJxT3O9qA)**.  It's probably the most unique romance out there and probably the only that doesn't end on confession and goes far beyond high school, explores struggles of adulthood and many other related things. 

It is sad as fuck from time to time but it's also inspiring and heartwarming as hell and often makes you look for some event's from other angle. 

**[Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2GujJZfXpg)** movie.  Gorgeous animation and art, great story, beautiful music and good entry for everybody.

**[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsOlhzPEfY)/[Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uq34TeWEdQ)**. Best first option for new people.  Great epic story with dark elements, interesting and phylosophical themes, great world building and tons of great characters. If you have time - Watch original FMA first, make some break and then watch brotherhood. If no then only Brotherhood. 2003 version went anime original after some point because manga was still ongoing while brotherhood is full canon adaptation but they are still totally different stories that both deserve watching. 

**[Attack On Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMXgHfHxKVM)** Relatevely recent, very popular show. Just look the opening, it's best way to describe the show. Gorgeous art, animation and style, pretty dark with interesting story. 

**[Shinsekai Yori.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz1ypuGJ3VM)** Show about post apocalyptic world, but in not usual post 
apocalyptic setting. There are a lot of philosophic and psychological things along with interesting story and some very interesting plot twists. 

**[Parasyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm8UjBAS3cs)** Interesting story, a lot of gore, some romance. Very interesting to keep track of how main character changes during the whole show

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt26CSwCNao)** This is mystery thriller in detective style with pretty interesting story. It also has some pretty violent scenes.

**[Made In Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91G8m9uM_0)** Don't be fooled by art style of the show, it's not happy children on happy adventure show. Probably the darkest show of this year(well, 2017 :P). Has very interesting story and world building.

**[Cowboy Bebop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)** Personally I didn't like it a lot but this is indeed classic, it's really atmospheric and at some point you should definitely watch it.


**[Hunter x Hunter \(2011\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faqmNf_fZlE)** It's your not usual shounen.The show has pretty interesting story and surprisingly likable*(no matter how strange this may sound)* villains. It's worth all it's ~150 episodes.


**[Spice and Wolf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw)** Very calm and beautiful show in medieval setting that follows adventures of traveling merchant and his wise wolf :).


**[Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C337shIT9LI)** Pretty popular and very unique show. Hard to describe it, it has comedy, slice of life, sci-fi, ~~Hitler~~ and one of the best male characters with his inner beautiful sarcastic monologue. Also sequel movie is masterpiece.

**[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wPbJlFBUw)** Probably the best hype show out there."
