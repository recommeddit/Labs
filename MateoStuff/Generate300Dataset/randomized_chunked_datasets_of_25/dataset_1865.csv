4037,best online college,"Here's what I did. I've had a pretty successful career but not having a degree really bugged me. After a lot of trial and error. I went back to school at 26 (now 31 and finally close to graduation) and I highly recommend the following path:

- Enroll at you local Community College first. Most community colleges offer almost completely online programs today. The advantage of a community college is that you have an actual brick and mortar school to drive to to meet with tutors and professors, while still doing almost all your classes online. This also give you the option of taking more difficult/interesting classes in person. If you worried about your age you'll learn CC varies from 18-65. Also this will save you a ton of money. Not to mention in some cases an AA degree from a CC might be worth more than a for profit online degree. 

- After enrolling at the local community college look at your states online college program. For instance in my area we have UMUC (University of Maryland) and Penn State Online. Most state college systems offer an online program linked to your actual school system. This makes transferring credits seamless. I would dual enroll in CC and your states online almost right away. Most will have a transition program so not a single credit is wasted and you'll earn a AA after your second year. Even though UMUC for example blitzs our market with ads at least I know its not for profit like UoP.

- It sounds like your career is setup well, but most IT programs have classes based on certifications. I would recommend taking the cert after the class. For example a typical ""network security"" class will link directly to Security+ cert.

- Suck it up and realize it will take 4-6 years even online, but we live in a golden age online education and you'll find a vast amount offered from free sources to help out. 

Good Luck!"

34971,best NFL player,"Huh. Maybe I’m biased by how bad the Texans were last year. To me, feels weird to have the QB of a bottom 5 team in the top 20."

14949,best romantic novel,"This is a solid list but I would definitely not classify Honey Girl as a Romance but instead a contemporary fiction with romance elements because the romance isn’t the central plot. But it’s an amazing book by a diverse author, so glad to see it get noticed."

25354,best spiderman actor,"&#x200B;

1. Garfield is like Peter Parker straight out of comicbook pages, in terms of his personality. But Maguire is certainly feels more likable and easier to root for, so his Peter works better for a movie adaptation, I guess.
2. Garfield, no question
3. Garfield and Maguire
4. Garfield 100%
5. Both Garfield and Tobey had a great supporting cast, but I prefer Maguire's
6. Garfield is objectively the best actor out of 3, so that's an easy win for him
7. Well, we all know that Emma was the best, so Garfield wins
8. Tobey
9. Also Tobey
10. Tobey and Garfield
11. As I said above, Garfield looks like Peter Parker from the comics."
60114,best perfume,"I'll cast another vote for pacifica! 

I tried French Lilac and it was a very believable butterfly bush scent. Decent strength and longevity without being too much. I ordered a rollerball of that, Persian Rose - which I wore in 2017 and remember loving, and Himalayan Patchouli Berry which was a blind buy because it sounded really nice. 

I noticed Persian Rose wasn't at ulta anymore and I could only find it on the pacifica website so I'm scared they'll discontinue it :("
