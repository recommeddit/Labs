5431,best home improvement store,"I prefer Home Depot. I fucking love the electronic receipts they do, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable enough. I find Lowe’s is a bit higher priced."

1533,best ice cream flavor,"In the red bean ice cream I've had, they're soft beans mashed up a bit- not chunky at all, though. Azuki beans are sweet, so they make a great tasting ice-cream flavor. There are actually a couple Japanese treats that put azuki beans in pastries, sometimes shaped like fish (not sure why, though)."

33775,best electric car,"Have you driven an EV? I love the instant response of EVs, the ability to do one-pedal driving on twisty, challenging roads without even lifting your foot off the accelerator is sublime. The Model 3 is the best corner carver I've ever driven because it lacks the drama of the engine, the shifting, the braking. You're one with the machine, steering, accelerating, focusing. Not getting distracted by noise and vibration."

48201,best color to paint with,"Poster board, primed, would have been close enough for me. I'm not the one that wanted to choose between a dozen colours, though!

We did a test swatch only to see if we needed to prime the walls before changing the colour. Builder beige actually showed through and darkened the new colour, so we primed.

I can see what you mean about the surfaces, as I also painted a sheet of MDF in the room colour. It backs a bookcase. I sanded it, primed it, painted it two coats. It is very smooth, and it looks very close, but pleasingly brighter, good for the back wall of a bookcase."
