I think hiring a cleaning service for a few hours would be appreciated.  You give them your budget and they tell you what they will do.  It would be nice for someone to come in and get to those tasks done around the house I just Havent had the time or energy for. A weight off my shoulders.  Btw super sweet of you to want to do something for her just to show her she's awesome!
I still manually enter all info. Totally an option.
RIP Sammy boy.

"That's not really apples to apples though. In the realm of cameras, the 922 isn't the 10k bike or even the 2k bike. It might not even be the $800 bike lol.

I think we can all agree that the bottom line for a twitch webcam is 720p like the c270 and the top of the line would be some pro-camera with an Elgato cam link running HDMI directly into your computer pushing close to $1000.

The 922 isn't even technically the middle ground when it comes to webcams when you look at it that way. Realistically it's one step up from the bottom. That doesn't mean it's not professional quality, but it's definitely not professional gear.

If we were to take the bike analogy the 2k bike would probably be a GoPro. Then you have the option for 1080p with an insane frame rate."
It wont ever make any sort of noticeable difference.

"I forgot to mention in my other comment, if you like Zombies then I highly recommend either **Zombicide** (specifically the Black Plague edition) and/or **Dead of Winter**. 

Zombicide is basically Left4Dead (the video game) as a board gamer. Itâ€™s cooperative and youâ€™re placed into a city scenario with specific objectives and an escape point; Zombies continuously spawn as you search through the cities for weapons and level up as you go. Very fun, silly dice-roller. The board comes as modular tiles so thereâ€™s tons of variety in objectives & maps.

Dead of Winter is more thematic and story based. You play as survivors in a colony, trying to accomplish the mini-goal for each round while working toward the larger game-winning goal. Additionally, each player has their own secret goal and you can only win individually if you accomplish it, so youâ€™re mostly working together but also slightly working against each other as you have differing secret goals (and sometimes a person might be the Betrayer, who can win by sabotaging the group). The gameplay is more straightforward (move to this building, draw a loot card, use a die to shoot a zombie outside) but it feels great."
Golden retriever or a lab.
I'd imagine because *The Forever War* is already on there...
Hated realm of champions due to bad matchmaking. Most of the missions ending a failure and is frustrating. But i liked TC elite squad. Playing a bit of it daily. Now at Level 50.
Damn it. Great place to jump regardless.

"Xbox for me, xbox and ps4 are basically the exact same. have all three main ones. Love the xbox exclusives the most though. Halo, forza, gears, wasteland plus many more. Thought majority of the ps4 exclusives that I played were shite. Last of us, uncharted, God of war were  shite for me, really didn't like them.
Spiderman was class and horizon zero dawn was OK.

Switch would be second for me as their exclusives are much better than ps4 too, plus football manager and pokemon."

"Thanks, yes I need to take advantage of the curb side pickup. Only thing is I kind of like to see and feel what Iâ€™m buying, so I usually end up going in the store anyway 

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m a little hesitant to order from someone like wayfair for big purchases."
"Everybody on this list either has or will have a bust in the Hall of Fame one day.

[Jim Thorpe's statue guards the entrance.](https://www.seathelights.com/thestore/images/postcards/6667a.JPG) 

As someone who hasn't been closely following this list, the fact that Jim Thorpe isn't on it is a pretty big oversight IMO. Unless there's a rules-related reason, like excluding players from a certain era, Jim Thorpe needs to be included on any list of great football players."
Sounds good to me! Iâ€™m a big fan of consent and dirty talk. Who hoo!

"Depending on your views on certain pets, you might not like this.

Get a pair of rats. 

They are the hands down best pet for kids. They are jello slinkies in fur, and they love love LOVE attention. They snuggle and give kisses and love being carried around. Kids and rats can share snacks, rats can learn how to fetch and love to chase feather wands. Rats love snuggles on the sofa while you watch a movie. They are *the* best pet for children.

Care wise, rats are fairly easy. They need to be kept in pairs, that is not optional. They can and will die of depression, or become unhealthily attached to objects or people, or become agressive. A cage that gives 2 sq feet per rat is needed. They need a fully funished cage; hammocks, toys, hides, scraps of fabric or paper, baskets, multiple levels. They can be litter trained but they also do well with a full cage of litter. They need either paper pellets or aspen shavings, cedar or pine will make them sick. Cedar can lead to organ failure. Pine will give them a respiratory infection. Do not give your rats a wheel unless you have one that is HUGE. It has to be big enough for a full grown rat to run on with a straight back. Rats can get up to a foot not including their tail so wheels are mostly a no go. They need special rat food, but they can eat almost everything off your table. The only bad foods are: spicy, onions, caffiene, carbonation, citrus, and avacafo pits and skins. Everything else is edible for them.

Honestly they are a good fit for children that won't crush them. Get rats from a breeder, not the pet store. It costs more but your rats will be friendly off the bat instead of having to work with them for months. Rats do not need time to settle into the cage before you interact with them either, you can play on the first day. Rats do not bite, I have owned and bred rats for going on 7 years and have been bitten twice; once by a rescue who had issues from his previous home, and once by a rat that had to be grabbed *hard* because a dog was chasing it. Neither broke the skin, so I don't really count them as bites. Never feed your rats through the bars, or they will get overly excited at fingers through the bars and try to drag you in. 

Man I could talk about rats forever, but I'm going to cut it short. Get rats!"
