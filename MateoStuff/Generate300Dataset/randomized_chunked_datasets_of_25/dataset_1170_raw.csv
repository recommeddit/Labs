"That's one of the many reasons I *don't* like going to Lowe's -- too many clowns that can't leave home without bringing along their yappy little pseudo-dogs. Some of these damned animated dust-mops Never. Shut. Up.

Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. *Real* dogs. But I leave mine at home when I go shopping."

You also forgot Dolph Lundgren as the Punisher.
This was the most memorable drink from my 21st birthday. By most memorable I mean the very last thing I remember. I pulled a set of stairs off of someone's front door that night.

I was coming to say that. I've lived here for close to 20 years and NEVER seen a Mars bar. Our grocery stores around here dont even carry them. Where is all the Mars bar Googling coming from?

"I can't remember for sure, as I used to listen to them years ago. I think [this](http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Podcast/podcast.htm) might be the one, though. Looks like they have some other interesting stuff....might be gone for a while :-)"
Our attack is a bit lacking though. Depay isn't a super star.
Yeah.  I can imagine that generational instruction happening. It can be hard to break this patterns.  Even when the evidence stares you in the face.
"The Netherlands' way of playing football is probably one of the most influential of any team ever, and I'd say that them to 3 world cup finals is quite significant, especially considering Uruguay's 2 world cups came at a time when there were only 13 teams in the finals."

"If up-n-go works for too, couple of weetbix, a banana and a decent slug of low fat milk in a blender, quick whizz then put the whole lot in a keep cup  (or similar) and you're done.

3/4 fill the blender with water and run for 10 seconds to rinse. Empty it and clean it up when you get home."
"Such an underrated game. Its so good. The only reason it didnt do well when it launched was everyone was still attached to most wanted and carbon and wanted a sequel to those, and they got a track racing game.

Pro Street is honestly one of my favorite Need for Speeds ever."
"I do not recommend rabbits for kids. They are expensive(you need to see an exotic vet), a lot of work (dietary needs are very specific) and are not good with kids due to them being very skittish(prey animals).

*I have two rabbits"
