I went to his gig in Oaktown one night, and the next night went to SF for some dance music.  He happened to be there, just for fun, not to perform.

69255,"I work in business intelligence and analytics now.  It was a wild ride, though.  I started out working in a greenhouse, and was promoted to manager there.  Moved from managing that to a movie theater.  Once I learned something about financials, I went to work for a college as a financial aid counselor.  Plan was to get a higher degree, but I started helping out a coworker that did our IT and report writing.  He taught me about writing reports in a few different technology stacks.  He got a promotion, and pulled me into his department to work with him full time on reporting.  I moved again after a couple of years to work for a major university's fundraising branch and ran a team there.  Now I'm building a business intelligence department from the ground up for a healthcare company.

All to say- Get a job, any job, then network, remember how people work, and forge your own path.  Accepting a job does not force you into that company for any longer than you want it to.  You only owe an employer what time they've paid you for.  Once you find a chance to move up, grab it.",best major to study in college
