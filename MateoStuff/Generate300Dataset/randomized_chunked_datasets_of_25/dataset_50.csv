23269,best car racing video game,Sim games require more of a commitment. I find I don't jump into sims for a quick race compared to arcade racers.
37282,best amusement park,"That's fair. It's still probably close. MM loves flying out that sweet sweet ""Most Coasters in the Country"" tagline."
28744,best breakfast foods,"(Southern) United States- Bacon, eggs, hash browns, sausage, toast, pancakes, and fully loaded grits. Yes, some people eat all of this. What I have listed is not a menu, but the contents of one meal. And let me tell you, if you eat all of this for breakfast, you won't need any other food for the day."

52443,best hiphop album,"The Album was the highly anticipated debut of an incredibly talented young MC and he delivered a straight classic with not a single weak track. The production is great too as expected when you have 4 Boom Bap legends working on the production: Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, DJ Premier. That's an avengers endgame level collab. Look you can find it bland but coherence and consistency is top notch and an album should be fire from start to end which it frankly is. So I think your personal preferences shouldn't play a huge role when judging this (boom bap/90s) masterpiece (you seem to have a fable for experimental shit which is fine I love experimental stuff too).

""Objectively"" speaking it definitely is one of the best Hip Hop Albums ever made (critics, fans, rappers love it and it had a huge influence). I must partly agree though the only hard facts (indisputable) are sales and awards but I feel like the opinion of fellow rappers and critics is important too.

PS: We could dissect beats and analyse lyrics and discover a billion gems though great producers + Talented young rapper= Masterpiece"

6864,best iPhone,"The XR I have now I guess.

I was late to the party. I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old, but when the iPhone came out, I was still into my Blackberry. I experimented with Android breifly (ugh) and then Windows Phone, which I loved for 3-4 years. I would have honestly stayed with Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it's UI ideas tbh, but it tanked.

I finally jumped ship and got a 5S. After that a 6S plus, 8 plus and now the XR. It wasn't until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones. It took me some time to warm up to iOS, but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it. 

My XR is my favorite so far, but it has a few limitations. Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus, which was too big for me and the XS didn't have the battery life I wanted. The XR's cheap price made it an easy decision and it's been great. I think I'll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par."
39919,best Chrome extensions,"It's not useful at all, but you just made me happy knowing this exists and now I have it on my Chrome."
64031,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Mobilism is by far your best bet IMO.  They also offer a 10 day premium trial which I highly recommend.  Id say you'll be able to find 90% of the books you're looking for on there.  Takes a few minutes to get used to the site but after that you're laughing!!

32163,best hotel to live in,I'd say my best hotel experience was at the Hilton on the gold coast in Australia. My friends and I decided to go all out and go 5 star for a holiday the year out of school. Our amazing stay started off rocky though and what really made it great was their problem solving.  We booked our holiday the week after schoolies and when we got there the schoolies had damaged the room and stretched a used condom over the smoke detector. We called the reception and let them know. Asking if they can give us a different room. The manager himself came to our rescue and was very apologetic. We got VIP treatment and a room upgrade. From a normal room straight up to the top floor penthouse at no extra charge. We got all the extras you get when you actually pay for that room. Essentially got 6 days free since we didn't get charged for the difference so that was the best hotel experience ever for a bunch of 18yr old.
