"Thanks, I had no luck with Inmac or Brokenstones, any tips on how to get an invite for those?"
">Considering the price point I would expect to have 0 issues just like my LG CX

Just buy another LG CX and put it on your table. It's like four 24"" 1080p monitors!"
It's the little things.
"Right now I just pull a light, 5x8' trailer with a couple motorcycles on it and stuff like lumber and drywall. So I don't need anything that big but may want something bigger in the future. I'll take a look at the towing map there. I don't think I'll need to tow 5000+ ever."
I read that as *Over* cooked and laughed. I think because I was already worried about the bacon burning with OP being in the shower and all.
"Eclipse Second Dawn is fantastic. Probably my favorite game of the year so far, and I've played most on your list. Easy to learn, lots of strategy, just a fantastic game."
"sometimes my brain replays that clip with the elephants going ""AH!""
or the dog/cat that has to live with the memories of an american railroad worker."
"AMD: Plenty of room to expand its business as intel is making a U-turn. Cpu, server chips, gpu, apu. 
AAPL: No need to explain
ASML: Monopolising lithography machine market
TSM: (Almost) monopolising foundry market
SE: Sea is like amazon of south east asia. The business is based in Singapore, so, there is no ccp politic risk. Growth is accelerating at a crazy pace."
"Yeees, the amount of relief they offer to my back is phenomenal. I always recommend the smaller ones to people with kids, gotta save those backs early."
I give a lot of weight to SU&SD reviews but they lean heavily toward games with a lot of “above the table” interaction between players for games. I think that’s why they were so critical of this game. I was skeptical at first too but grabbed the game for pandemic playing and have played it a dozen times already (1 and 2 player)
">reminiscent of a lover's palm cupping your face

😯 

I will be smelling this on my next trip to the shop!"
And The music was amazing on that game! it really was ahead of its time
"You want cold? Visit anywhere in North Dakota during late December to late February.

And be stuck here because nothing will start...


Quite a few ice hockey games here too. Dallas sounds interesting also"
Best & worst at the same time is red bull sugarfree lol
A while back I tried node-fetch and I was frustrated because its behavior didn’t match the browser implementation. Do you know if that’s still the case?
"Hi, does he plan on playing games on his laptop?"
Beer. Bourbon. Wine.
Kenmore isn’t an innately bad purchase if you know what you’re looking for
"Exactly. Even at 25km/h e bikes are dangerous but in pretty much every country there is no requirement to have the same protection as a motorbike.

No idea why people are downvoting the comment and not saying why. Doubt they watched the videos."
"Honestly, who checks their home email this often? Is this for people who own a home business? I can't imagine many businesses use gmail.

&#x200B;

If you work in an office environment, then you sort of need to have your email open at all times as priorities may change and urgent situations may come up. You need to have your finger on the pulse at work.

&#x200B;

At home, who gives a shit? Check you email once a week. I'm sure nothing on it is that urgent."
Nikka Ramen! Definitely the best!
Card crawl is awesome!
"Every Indian family uses a pressure cooker. I can say with confidence 99% of indians use this. 

I can't imagine my life without a pressure cooker. It makes rice, meat, lentils, pulses, beans almost everything in less time."
