70727,best movies with a cool twist,That’s why the twist shouldn’t have been revealed. I think the movie would have been better open ended
42783,best detective show,another British one! added to the list
3631,best college for research,"There are many of these indexes. This one in particular seems to be sponsored by Elsevier and the map is based only on the 'Research' aspect. The website is not very clear, but the ranking criteria seems to be published papers per professor. This is not about teaching.

Anyway, I was really surprised to find UNC in that map. Some local newspaper will surely make a huge story about this."
26383,best politician,"Really, this one. Most responses in this thread are incredibly cynical, but you don't need to be incredibly wealthy (In Canada at least) or a psycho. Charisma and intelligence will get you places."
13372,best spreadsheet editor,You is referred generally to people not necessarily to OP. Making a database program is entirely doable and running scripts just requires the ability to run a programming language inside the program. Excel's vba language is incredibly weak as far as I know and can be easily exceeded by something like matlab.
42800,best detective show,"Elementary   
Izombie"
20380,best workout music,"“I’m so North Memphis” by Juicy J goes so hard you might wanna rob your own house

“15th and the 1st” by  Waka Flocka and Gucci Mane goes so hard you might wanna run head first through a brick wall"

39261,best web browser,"best looking? What does that mean?

you don't even mention what platform?

what purpose?"
72807,best Linux distro,"Despite its difference, I've found that most people adapt to the Gnome interface remarkably well. I think Unity is equally strange to to most - but they're both quite intuitive interfaces once you get the basics.

Also, thanks for the Fedora info. Outside of its connection to RHEL and Gnome I don't know much about it."
27046,best board games,"Uwe is famous for action selection games where you have to “feed your family”; basically a mechanic where you lose resources or lose points every round Proportionally to how many workers you have.

He’s also famous for Tetris tile puzzle games.

He then made a game with 50 something worker placement spaces and a huge amount of puzzle pieces to fill a massive personal player board, with an expansion that replaces that worker placement board with an entire new one.

You could get his tighter Smaller games Agricola and patchwork and probably enjoy the concepts of feast for Odin better, feast for Odin is just...more.

 I compare it to watching batman 89’ as a kid, and then getting to see a huge spectacle like avengers 3."
37046,best roller coaster at six flags,I used to hate viper but I enjoy it now.. Maybe it is just because I am taller :P ... Tatsu uses the landscape well.
22001,best celebrity,This is the cutest thing I've read about in a while.  I imagine it was really nice for Steven Tyler to have just a normal conversation with another musician.
57617,best cologne,I’ll probably get voted down for this but...the cologne I get the most compliments on is Bath and Bodyworks blue color. I swear I wear everything from it to Tom Ford Costa Azzura and Tobacco Vanille and I get at least one daily compliment on it and it’s about $30.
57935,best cologne,I wear Varvatos by John Varvatos in the winter and Essential by Lacoste in the summer. If I'm feeling fancy I'll wear Touch by Burberry too. I like the Lacoste for summer because it has a citrus top note. The Varvatos is probably my favorite though.

59970,best perfume,"SJP Lovely, CK Euphoria, Cacharel LouLou, Aquolina Pink Sugar, D&G Light Blue can all be found for v reasonable prices and are very pretty! I like Dana Tabu as well but it’s probably more divisive"
11376,best gifts for dad,I wonder if this sort of thing actually started with corporate PR employees but redditors just assumed OP was being silly.
53810,best medicine for a cold,"Tylenol Severe Cold and Flu. That shit is magical and got me through work for all of December. This tip was handed down to me by my dad who I had never seen sick. Keep it well, Reddit."
5812,best programming language for web development,I don't disagree. My point was that it's false that php is unacceptable for quote unquote real development.
42048,movies like Inception,"Gattaca - I wouldn't necessarily call it a mind-twister, but I do think it's a gorgeous (almost austere looking) piece of sci-fi that's really well done with strong performances from Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman."
68701,best science fiction novel,">Machineries of Empire

Couldnt get into it. Such weird shit (not in a good way) like how infantry formations use the calendar to get special bonuses and shit???"
