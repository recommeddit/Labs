They have a site with a short questionnaire about your lifestyle & skin and serve you a semi-custom cologne for work and for nightlife. Not as fancy as the other brands listed in this thread but they seem to nail it every time.

Edit: they do soaps and other bathroom products now too but I have no reference for them. I'd assume they're decent quality."
