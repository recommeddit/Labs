"I hadn't realized they nominated China Meiville, that's sort of funny considering he is actually a proper leftist as far as I know not liberal left etc.
This place does always recommend the same things I agree but to temper that complaint look at the way Jesmin has dominated the recent Hugo awards, I see more interesting answers when the question is more specific.
I am probably not the right person for this argument anyway as I have found it harder to find new authors I like since maybe 2010, noticed the decline in the Gardiner Dozios yearly anthology I religiously bought"
Has to be The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Hands down.
I think you said it best!
The viola. Like a violin but without all the irritating super high pitched notes.
How long ago did you go to Alton towers?
"I really had trouble understanding this game and ended up deleting it before giving it a fair chance. 
Is it a good game or just a pretentious gimmick?"
Loved the movie until she actually makes it out and kills a spaceship with a bottle......

"I have a whole-house filter because I use well water.  The filter is a snap to change.  You unscrew a cup-shaped thing that the filter sits in.  Dump out the old filter, put in the new one.

HOWEVER, be sure that when the filter is installed, its plumbinb is fitted with a bypass valve.  Otherwise, it would be a pain because you would have to shut off the water for your whole house and drain the pipes to change it.  A plumber will charge you about $250 in my area to put one in, plus the cost of the filter.  You most likely have to sweat copper to do it.  We added ours during construction when the tools were available."

"Because the parent comment had an implication as if United being ahead of Liverpool was some sort of an anomaly, and the only criteria that is relevant is the number of CLs won by the respective clubs."
"We have had wonderful experiences in Cozumel, Aruba, and Puerto Rico. Would recommend any of them. For sheer relaxation on the beach and some water activities, I would jump at the chance to go to Aruba. Absolutely beautiful water, soft beaches, a constant light breeze, and a very relaxed atmosphere. Have fun wherever you go!"
"> playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy

To expand on this, the big reason is because piano is so easy that being able to play it at a high level just has you doing *so much*. I mean, aside from other finger keyboards like it, what other instruments are able to do what pianos can do at the efficiency and ease you can with a piano? Just off the top of my head:

1. Moving around super thick jazz chords with all manner of extensions

2. Playing a smooth 4-part harmony with relatively independent lines

3. Playing a melody, chords, and a (relatively) complex baseline all at once"

"We definitely do. The games you listed are lacking the core elements of what makes an RPG. Player's choice story developments, crafting, grinding, weapon and ability upgrades, etc. 

While some of the games you listed may include some of these elements, they are more of an action-adventure game than an RPG. No one would ever say Spiderman or Shadow of the Colossus is an RPG. Games like Mass Effect, Fallout, and Final Fantasy are more traditional RPGs"
The other one rolled down I think.
