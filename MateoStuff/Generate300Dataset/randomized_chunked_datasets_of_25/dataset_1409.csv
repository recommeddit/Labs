62842,"People who I speak to barely know what a confidence interval is and even people who study stats get it wrong because it’s so unintuitive. Seriously, if you say ""its not that credible intervals are easier to understand"" then even you don’t understand the difference. [One is objectively more intuitive](https://youtu.be/KhAUfqhLakw?t=1250) and people always mix up one for the other. Guess which one that is?

The only difficulty is that bayesian stats requires a lot more background and time to understand and learn completely. The calculations are also a little more involved. (This is only true if you are using MCMC, also, while deep learning is king nobody can complain about high computational requirements being an issue.) But once you do all of that then you're left with something that's easier to communicate to everyone.

And yes, I need to explain stuff to people with no/limited stats knowledge.

You use bayesian in the case where you can’t run large experiments and you don’t have a lot of data and there’s a lot of uncertainty. Using a bayesian analysis you can quantify all of that uncertainty and still make informed decisions under such conditions.

You're thinking about this wrong if you think this is Bayesian vs XGBoost, because you would use these tools under different circumstances!",Best Data Science textbook

26287,"Thanks,

I didn't include /r/RPA at first because I excluded subreddits that haven't been active in the last month, but I guess this is going to be a list that needs some flexibility, so I added it. I already had /r/USpolitics, but missed /r/politics_new, thanks for that.

I also added the candidates subreddits, thanks for the suggestion, even though they are very small and this list will be very tough to maintain if it includes every subreddit with 1 subscriber and only a few posts, but seeing as the campaigns are just getting underway I'll try to keep the very small ones for candidates maintained. 

Any help would be appreciated.

I should also add for others reading this, that I used [RedditList](http://redditlist.com/dir/1898/Politics), as well as the other lists (and some legwork) and most of the categories are sorted by number of subscribers, but there are bound to be mistakes, so if anyone notices any just give me a heads up.",best politician
