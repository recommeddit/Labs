"TSLA, since they are continually changing their busines model to disruptively attack areas with biggest possible revenue (starting with cars, going on to the energy sector, insurance sector and now it looks like they are even planning to enter the global workforce sector with the Tesal bot)

Waiting on Starlink/SpaceX IPO. That would be a no brainer insta-buy for me.

Other than that I'm looking around for anything that will profit off of climate change (i.e. energy storage, thermal storage, PV and wind energy companies). Unfortunately - particularly with storage - so far I see no clearly disruptive ones that can achieve global scope production. 

Vertical farming and meat substitute products also seem interesting and I'm keeping an eye on the relevant companies, but so far none seem to be gearing up to go massively global that would warrant a longterm investment.

AMZN if you don't care about ethics (which I do so I don't own any)."
Because it's a lot better for people who like doing things their own way and customizing their hone as much as possible
Maybe....my roommate had a beta fish in college and I don’t remember anything too extensive going on.  At least not anything an 8yo couldn’t handle.
"absolutely agree - im thinking of starting with python & r for data, and the data science handbook (comments above). I'll see where that takes me. Thank you very much for the links!"
I’m just glad it’s not weird. I think it smells really good.

Kickstarting a collection? Anything Gen 7. You can get most games for dirt.
I didn't know that actually. Thanks for sharing!
"Huevos rancheros, New Mexico style. Or a [green chile breakfast burrito](http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/200257/new-mexico-green-chile-breakfast-burritos). Or carne adovada with eggs. Ingredients may be hard to get but well worth it!"
no fragrance at the gym
"I was thinking the same. I'd understand being in the back half a bit, but 17+ people leaping him in the past 10 years? I don't know about that.

But like someone else said somewhere, different voters this time around and maybe they just value you different things."
I loved playing Gran turismo as a kid. They managed to make little boy me get excited for a racing game even though I never really had any interest in the genre. So fun to drive your way up to whatever favorite car you had at the time (Dodge Viper btw!).
double bourbon and gingerale
"If nothing else, I just have to recommend Fate/Zero. If you like fighting, vast array of amazing characters, and a deep world to sink your teeth into, you can't go wrong with this show. It doesn't hurt that Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works just started up too 

Other suggestions: Kyousou Giga, Steins;Gate, Penguindrum, Shensekai Yori, Madoka Magica"
"Tnx, can you tell me about the stopping power between the two?"
My favorite to run to was always Revolution deathsquad by dragonforce.
Shade may ruin the lawn. FYI. I’d skip the tree and just landscape more. Only my opinion…
Years ago I lived in a small community in the Southwest. Some of the  residents heated their homes with wood; cedar and pine. On calm Winter mornings the smoke would linger in the valley making my walk to work a fabulous experience. Thanks for the memory jog.
Oh man I loved Silver Linings by Maggie Osborne! She has some great solid romances.
is flat confirmed?
"General school work, the occasional watching videos, movies, that sort of stuff, as well as if possible editing videos."
You should consider OXEN-Free
Oh my...I need these in my life!
