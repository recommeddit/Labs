"**Who are you going to play with**

I just looked through my games and the first couple I bought have barely been touched because they are too difficult for a lot of people/take a long time and play better with 4+

Now when I want to get a game I think will I play it with my wife/friends/gamer group and can I teach it to them (most of my friends like to play games and have a few drinks so could barely manage TTR the first time we played) and how long will it take since finding 4+ hours to play Game of thrones is a challenge in itself"
Why does that make you sad?

I would suggest using baking soda as it has a lower RDA (relative dentin abrasivitity) value than any toothpaste and its alkaline nature neutralizes acids and helps promote remineralization of the enamel. It also helps to whiten your teeth somewhat. Use a fluoride mouthwash afterwards.

"Green tea or red bean hands down.  Unfortunately they’re a pain in the ass to find here, so I can’t get them regularly."
Portola actually has the best food now after the redesign
"Dior Sauvage is imo the best parfume ever made. Problem is it works so well that everybody has it, still won't stop me though."
I'm so hopeful that One Last Stop proves to be another hit!
Sage! Personal Journals was amazing too.
"Despite it being a 2-in-1 touchscreen device, it doesn't really charge a premium for that. It is one of the most powerful non-gaming 15.6"" laptops."
I would just hand out pieces of bite sized chocolate (Hershey's) to the kids (two each). If you let them grab it they may take a lot more. I would also just leave the lights on. I wouldn't want to put decorations out because it only attracts more kids. I just want to get it over with.
"Curious, when new developments like this come out, how do you keep updated on what's coming out?"
"Armaf Derby Clubhouse Gold. 100 ml for $20 and my wife can't get enough of it.

From what I can tell, Armaf has some amazing cheapies and clones, including several Creed knockoffs (Milestone for Millesime Imperial, Sillage for Silver Mountain Water) that some people actually prefer to the original."
I made one as a Christmas gift for my husband Few years back. He loves it. We call it the Stool Stool.
I'd still put Barcelona above Bayern Munich.
I just use axios...
I love Minchin.
"Guess I got unlucky, or you got lucky... We may never know! :) 

Good shout on the racism thing. I never meant to imply it was better or worse than elsewhere, it was just... unexpected I guess. Worth pointing out I was in Amsterdam too. May have been different elsewhere, but I stand by that place being unfriendly if you come in with anything other than a whopper of a salary."
"Fried golden plantain discs seasoned with Cajun spices and cayenne, topped with runny eggs, salsa, and sliced avocado. 10/10 would make every day if I could."
"mcmaster.com for every specialized part, bolt, beam, motor, fitting, flange, etc you can think of. They have literally every kind of fastener and fitting and gasket you can think of, searchable by material, size, threads, etc."
I appreciate your comment! Thank you!
BRING ME EVERRYYYOOONNNEEEE!!
"Uhm. Have you seen Insidious?
I found it quite good and the ending was a little way twisted."
