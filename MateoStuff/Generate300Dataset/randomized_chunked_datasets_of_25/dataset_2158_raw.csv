"Nope, you're correct. Both were originally US military contract holders; I believe Randolph currently holds the contract for ""Aviator"" glasses. They're very similar in hand although I \*think\* the Randolphs \*feel\* slightly heavier/thicker/more durable... but that's probably just my cognitive dissonance."
"If you are interested  in a book on data science for natural sciences, Springer has a book called ""Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform""  [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290)

In addition to some theory, it has many practical data analysis examples using Python/Java codding."
"I would give Messi that crown if he was always consistent. He's definitely the most talented ever. Copa America this year is a great example of his inconsistency. He just can't get over his championship game letdowns. 
Maradonna wins, hands down."
"He plays for Cincinnati, that's why."
"The processor wouldn't probably cover that then, the CPU doesn't make up for the GPU. What is your budget? Unless you can spend \~$1,500, you probably will not get a 2-in-1 with a dGPU."

"Always fun to get into this kind of stuff. 

In my opinion, it's not as important in those types of games, but there is a difference you can slightly tell, depending on your framerate and refresh rate of course. The buttery smoothness in general stuff even, it's so hard to go back to 60hz on my laptop. 

I would say if you need to save the money, a normal 60hz monitor would do fine. If not, I would definitely recommend a 120hz or 144hz monitor. Even if you can't tell the difference in game, it's still nice to have regardless."

"Kim is my fav and Caitlyn, then Scott and Kourtney are my least."
Really is the best tutorial for a fairly complex game that I've played! Just follow the first 5 missions and open things when it tells you. Really nice. They even have a starting hand of cards that explains the iconography and effects in more detail.
