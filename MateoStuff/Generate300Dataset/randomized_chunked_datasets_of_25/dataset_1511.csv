33703,"I like them but they have limitations. I leased a Fiat 500e for 3 years and it was a great experience within its limitations. It was good enough that I had a deposit down on a Hyundai Kona Electric. The 260 miles of range and fast-charge capabilities would have solved most of the issues I had with the 500e. Unfortunately all the Hyundai dealers around here are using the limited availability to tack on $7.5k+ of ""market adjustments"" and other crap to get more money out of the buyer. I simply couldn't justify the roughly $55k MSRP for a car that's identically equipped as the $25k model right next to it with the different drivetrain. If I'm going to spend that kind of money I want nicer materials, design, and fit & finish.",best electric car
