7015,best iPhone,"I don’t understand the big deal regarding OLED when the Macs and iPads we use all day aren’t OLED either. It’d be one thing if every Apple product was OLED, THEN it would be weird to buy an LCD iPhone, but most screens are LCD."
60233,best freezer brand,So you're saying it was a good deal?
71660,best movies with a cool twist,I wish that eagle scene was cut from the beginning/middle. I think it would of been more fun of a reveal if we didn’t already see why they couldn’t leave.
33703,best electric car,"I like them but they have limitations. I leased a Fiat 500e for 3 years and it was a great experience within its limitations. It was good enough that I had a deposit down on a Hyundai Kona Electric. The 260 miles of range and fast-charge capabilities would have solved most of the issues I had with the 500e. Unfortunately all the Hyundai dealers around here are using the limited availability to tack on $7.5k+ of ""market adjustments"" and other crap to get more money out of the buyer. I simply couldn't justify the roughly $55k MSRP for a car that's identically equipped as the $25k model right next to it with the different drivetrain. If I'm going to spend that kind of money I want nicer materials, design, and fit & finish."
70759,best movies with a cool twist,"Watchmen  
Shutter Island  
Mr. Nobody  
Memento  
Seven  
Inception  
there quite more, but for now, that´s all i remember."
1861,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Olio's Pizzeria is really good. There is a new pizzeria that opened on the west-side, only makes a certain number of pizzas a day, so have to get there early, called [Revolver](https://www.independent.com/2020/08/24/revolver-brings-new-york-pizza-to-the-santa-barbaras-westside/)

I usually make my own, better than what you get in SB."
40426,best midrange GPU,"You’re right, I could’ve told him to wait for RTX 4000, and I’d still be more useful than you. I could explain why the 3060 WILL be coming soon, but you don’t seem interested, and you’re definitely not worth wasting the few minutes I’m going to spend explaining the leaks."
5788,best programming language for web development,"you will need a pet spider, study architecture, and biology. be careful and dont get bit."
29037,best calendar tool,Been my go-to ever since it released. Amazing piece of software.
65316,best phone service company,"There is a row that indicates if taxes and fees are included or extra :) It's called ""Taxes & Fees Included"" and it displays a true/false value."
51944,best iphone case,I’ve got the leather case for my 13 Pro and it’s amazing. Would highly recommend
41666,movies like Inception,"I love Winans' work! Cool, what did you do on those films?"
69349,best major to study in college,"I was a political science major in undergrad and I have no major regrets. It was a good match for my skill set at that time, it was super interesting, and I've found fulfilling work in my field in a few different jobs since graduation. 

I do wish I had a stronger quantitative background, but that's more something I think my secondary education should have done better - I think I challenged myself at the level I reasonably could have based on my skills during college and after."
34897,best NFL player,"Well done on the Cook write up!  I don't want much change in the offense next, but Cooks depth of target needs to go the fuck up ASAP.  He could be so much more than a screen RB."
37646,best Marvel movie,"I’d put Captain Marvel a lot higher, and Guardians 2 a lot lower...but other than that it’s about right."
14044,best place to get free books,Mobilism i think
32545,best vacation resort,"When we were in Bali, we spent most of our time in guesthouses that were about $20/day. However, we did two days here and it was very nice and still only $80.  Not really a resort feel, but Ubud is a fun small town to explore, if you are into that kind of thing vs. your more standard tourist fare (getting drunk at a pool bar, etc.)

3200,best webcamera,C920 will forever reset to auto.  Not sure if c922 is the same but if not that would be a selling point for me if I didn’t have one already
35580,best alcoholic drink,"Balls-in-cider (say it out loud), is the best name I've heard for this wonderful drink."
9456,best toothpaste,"What if one was allergic to triclosan, what toothpaste would they prefer them?"
14401,best romantic novel,"I love all her books but that one for some reason always stands out. I just really enjoyed it. Also, it was one of the first that I read by her so maybe that is why!"
54184,best medicine for a cold,"Rest, staying warm (especially when your body goes into fever to burn out the virus), relaxation, eating light, easily-digested meals (not over-salted canned soup, though), staying hydrated, getting plenty of zinc and vitamin C, and treating your symptoms (which reduces the stress on your body and therefore can shorten the duration of the cold) with cough syrup."
65783,best college in california,"I’m happy to see UC Davis on the list, but also surprised at Cal Poly’s exclusion."
56152,best action and adventure movie,"A lot of these suggestions are great action movies, but still have some areas of “rest.” Crank and Crank 2 are really the only ones that don’t stop. Especially Crank 2. 

Honorable mention though: once the first murder happens, Green Room doesn’t really let up until the end credits."
45996,best trick or treating candy,The homemade candy is the best.  Shows that you care.
