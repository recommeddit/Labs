40141,"Everyone is mentioning some pretty basic ones, so I would like to mention 5 specialized ones that became really important to my workflow in the last couple of years...

* [History Trends Unlimited](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme) syncs your history to a local database to work around the (approximate) 3-month time limit imposed by Chrome. Basically an improved search for your chrome history.

* [Selection Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selection-search/gipnlpdeieaidmmeaichnddnmjmcakoe) Most useful ext to me, it's basically a menu of customized searches. Let's say your workflow includes a constant search from google and other sites, with this extension you can save those parameters and recall them to search by just selecting text over the web. If you have 5 searches in one menu you can open them all at once with just a shortcut. A good example of this is searching on different stock images sites, if you are looking for pictures of dogs, you can just hover the text ""dog"" and search for results of dog pictures in a customized search for like 10 sites at the same time, with just one shortcut.

* [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) Simple, basic, useful. Click OneTab to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.

* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) Change the appearance of websites instantly. This allows you to change the CSS on different websites locally. If you visit a website, a forum, or a blog a lot but you find the background annoying for your eyes, the size of the letters too small, or something similar, you can change it with this. It has a UI and also the possibility to manually add CSS code

* [Extensions Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-manager-aka-sw/lpleipinonnoibneeejgjnoeekmbopbc) Pretty selfexplanatory. A extensions, applications, and themes manager. Disable and undo your changes with a click.",best Chrome extensions

53905,"Sunscreen inhibits vitamin d from forming though. I don't use it unless I have to be in the sun for longer than 10-20 min. 10 min without sunscreen is a great way to get your vitamin d on. And that short amount of time doesn't usually burn you here in Sweden.  

Though I might add that we only get the sun at the right height above the horizon to be able to form vitamin d between late May to early September. It's a short window.",best medicine for a cold
