40141,best Chrome extensions,"Everyone is mentioning some pretty basic ones, so I would like to mention 5 specialized ones that became really important to my workflow in the last couple of years...

* [History Trends Unlimited](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme) syncs your history to a local database to work around the (approximate) 3-month time limit imposed by Chrome. Basically an improved search for your chrome history.

* [Selection Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selection-search/gipnlpdeieaidmmeaichnddnmjmcakoe) Most useful ext to me, it's basically a menu of customized searches. Let's say your workflow includes a constant search from google and other sites, with this extension you can save those parameters and recall them to search by just selecting text over the web. If you have 5 searches in one menu you can open them all at once with just a shortcut. A good example of this is searching on different stock images sites, if you are looking for pictures of dogs, you can just hover the text ""dog"" and search for results of dog pictures in a customized search for like 10 sites at the same time, with just one shortcut.

* [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) Simple, basic, useful. Click OneTab to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.

* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) Change the appearance of websites instantly. This allows you to change the CSS on different websites locally. If you visit a website, a forum, or a blog a lot but you find the background annoying for your eyes, the size of the letters too small, or something similar, you can change it with this. It has a UI and also the possibility to manually add CSS code

* [Extensions Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-manager-aka-sw/lpleipinonnoibneeejgjnoeekmbopbc) Pretty selfexplanatory. A extensions, applications, and themes manager. Disable and undo your changes with a click."

68916,best science fiction novel,"> Gideon the 9th

I think I've seen it mentioned here once or twice - I do see it a fair bit in /r/booksuggestions and /r/suggestmeabook but those have different crowds.

Going from the Hugos, which seem to be more what you're talking about, I do see *A Memory Called Empire* pretty often here."
71422,best movies with a cool twist,"It's in that moment you realize they aren't supercops.       
They're flat out stone cold *nuts*."
24198,best anime,"That’s fine, i can understand why it’s pretty low, since it’s not a popular series for newer generation especially"

53697,best medicine for a cold,"It's gotten to the point where even if I just fall asleep on the couch and someone watches tv, it enters my brain and fucks me up. Sister was watching an episode of svu about child porn and I ah..."
42026,movies like Inception,"Under the ice? The Thing from 1982? Doesn't look like a squid tho, but I can't remember anything else close to your description."
23051,best celebrity,"Yep, the wife and I take our daughters to YS quite often, and it's not unusual to see him walking around town. Most people leave him alone or just yell out, ""Hey Dave!"""
53905,best medicine for a cold,"Sunscreen inhibits vitamin d from forming though. I don't use it unless I have to be in the sun for longer than 10-20 min. 10 min without sunscreen is a great way to get your vitamin d on. And that short amount of time doesn't usually burn you here in Sweden.  

Though I might add that we only get the sun at the right height above the horizon to be able to form vitamin d between late May to early September. It's a short window."
1652,best ice cream flavor,Very cool thanks!
44687,best items under $100,I use an ikea chip clip / bag clip. Works like a charm on the toothpaste tube. Already had a bunch in the cupboard.
47134,best state to visit in the United States,"Check out San Antonio, Texas. You'll find great BBQ anywhere in Texas. About 30 minutes northeast from San Antonio is a massive outlet mall in San Marcos, Texas. http://www.tangeroutlet.com/sanmarcos
Your gf wiill go insane there. The best name brands for ridiculously fair prices. 

Catch a University of Texas football game in Austin, and then go river rafting on the Colorado River. Then head over to 6th street, downtown Austin, for a night of drinking/clubbing. With your English accent, they will love you over there. 

Austin is a liberal city. Nothing like the stereotype of backwoods Texas. So you'll really enjoy yourself."
21690,best winnie the pooh comic,"Well, Winnie the Pooh is supposed to be an [addict](http://www.omg-facts.com/view/Facts/3997) and to have ADHD. Though, I guess it doesn't entirely explain his asshole-ness.

In fact, [all the characters](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/163/12/1557.full.pdf) in the stories are supposed to represent some sort of psychological disorder, with Christopher Robin having a form of schizophrenia I believe.

Just kind of interesting IMO."
55562,best action and adventure novel series,"They've been spaced out quite a bit, unfortunately. It seems forever ago that the 2nd came out."
