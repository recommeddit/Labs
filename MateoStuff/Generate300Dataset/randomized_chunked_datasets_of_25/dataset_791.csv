14460,best romantic novel,"Omg, I just started the Rules of Scoundrels series and read the first two books in three days! LOVE Sarah Maclean's writing and can't wait to get my hands on the third one. The Goodreads reviews are solid, but I don't think they do the books enough justice."
33718,best electric car,"I have no place to charge it, and likely won't have for the next 20 years seeing how the housing market here has been on the brink of collapsing for years already.

I do like EV's, instant torque is fun and saving on gas is DEFINITELY fun when your gas is nearly $8/gallon.

I think I'll go hybrid before I go EV though, since a hybrid can at least survive on gas if the charging lot at work is full."

65723,best college in california,"Let's not forget to shine a light on the CSUs either for their outstanding cost-effectiveness and focus on instruction. As well as the other elite CA unis beyond USC and Stanford like CalTech, the Claremont Colleges, and the great assortment of private Jesuit institutions.

I know you probably just listed out the UCs because it's obvious and easy, and nobody wants to sit here all day listing out the dozens of outstanding colleges in CA, but OP seems to not know shit about it, and we shouldn't just lead him to believe that it's UC or bust."

12491,best gifts for mom,"my mom used to keep photo albums religiously when i was a kid. we have THOUSANDS of photos in at least 15 large albums, but around the time my dad died she slowly stopped taking pictures with a film camera so we have far fewer physical photos from 2004 onward. 5 years ago i printed out as many photos from those 9 years as i could find and organized them into an album for her, and every year since i've quietly stolen back the album (or, once it's full, bought a new one) and added a new section for that year with 50-80 photos. it's not really a surprise anymore, though the first time i gave it to her she got a little emotional. it's something of a tradition now for the album to get passed around through the whole extended family once she's opened it."

57274,best water brand,"depends where you're getting it from i guess.  https://www.oralanswers.com/bottled-water-fluoride/

but all those are currently below fda limits of 0.8ppm or mg/L.  

acidity doesn't hurt you, just look at all carbonated beverages.  

the amount of fluorine that's ""safe"" is also up for debate as well.  it's one of those things that we just don't know too much about.  the only thing we can say with a certainly is that ""too much"" is bad for you, but we don't know what ""too much"" is."
