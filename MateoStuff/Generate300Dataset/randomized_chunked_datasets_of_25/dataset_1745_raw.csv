"Quell! Great puzzle game, highly recommend checking it out if you haven’t."
"I don't use it regularly, when I judge headsets I use them stock first, then slowly try to flatten them with Eq. But that's not really good for gaming. But I didn't save my eq for it. Also do not use the cooler master eq."
You and me both!
"Also Taft as they run a group discount. Though depending on what you want (time to jump or weird fun people) Perris and Elsinore might be better though they are much a lot less personal. All three places are insured and safe when it comes to tandems. Perris also has indoor skydiving. If you want really cheap then Lodi. No matter what, get video."
So the takeaway from this story is that this Santa Anna dude was pretty bad.
I think you mean tin foil glasses
"scarlet nexus? it's more like a hack and slash than an rpg but it does have a lot of rpg mechanics in it, if you like dmc or spiderman i think you can get a kick out of it"
"I have! I love GGKs Prose, he has that melancholic tragic tone that cuts through everything. 

my favourite GGK is Sailing to Sarantium."
"Ditto on Hanae Mori, I use HM in the summer and HiM year round. Great for us college kids on a budget, though I should have gone with the EDP. Will next time!"
"Yeah, this is what my plumber said too.  If you can fix it, home depot.  If you need help, ACE is better."

"What music do you want to play?

is probably a good question to ask yourself at this point, to help guide your decision."
"True. But I make mine with frozen spinach. Blitz w some water then add a banana and handful of frozen mango. That’s it. Very energizing and affordable. Ps, I’m a dietitian"
Devils lake in Baraboo is awesome too
"Right, mine is massive and I hate the process of defrosting. It must be pushing 15-20 years old now, I should really look into how efficient it is compared to new models at some point."
Define-a-telly please do
"Gah, my friends and i would pull our cash together and buy some cheap plastic jug vodka. it was terrible. i have absolutely no clue how i was able to drink that."
"Wait, who is locking up guaifenesin? Unless you mean Mucinex D, which has pseudo in it, I'm not aware of anywhere that does this. Just curious."
"> You can get connectors for such

Maybe you can get the connectors but gen 2 C-C cables ?

>  There's also another vendor with magnetic connectors to swap out the connector plugs,

Not sure how magnetic connectors got into this, but yes, those exist, mostly non-standard but let's hope the Thundermag works. I haven't seen any other magnetic connector which attempts full USB C compatibility."
You’re in for a treat! The second book is better than the first
I have that one
"Continuum was pretty good. 

Orphan Black. 

Breaking bad."
"Me too. I like it customizability and flexibility. It's even better when combined with the ranger-plugin that come [z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua), which I have bound to cj (I used auto-jump before this, which used that binding as well).

I also really like how well it integrates with my keyboard-driven setup. I'm on i3 and I use a lot of programs that have similar keybindings, like Neovim and qutebrowser. i can even use it inside Neovim (including all settings and plugins)."
Thank you so much I appreciate it!
"We also have a limit on what to sell everyday. I've had to turn people away when we can't have any on the shelf. If your toothless and twitchy, you're probably not getting any."
