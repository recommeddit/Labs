11858,best gifts for dad,"Perhaps the son is a hipster, and ironically said ""some beer"" when in reality it was a pallet of Calgary."
17670,best iOS game,"ðŸ‘‰Gwent ðŸ‘ˆ

Hands down, one of my favorite truly-free IOS games. Itâ€™s a card game (think Hearthstone), but I like the gameplay a LOT more in all honesty."
13095,best gifts for mom,Nice try.. Mom!
30120,best Mexican war to study,"More so. A French victory in that war would have meant no American Revolution and no USA, although we can speculate that given the larger number of American colonists than French in North America, it's likely the colonies would have eventually won their independence from the French, but everything would have been different."
54835,best water filter,"Spore can also be acurate as bacterial endospores are resistant to bleaching as well as just about everything else we can throw at them. Species of bacteria that can form endospores include C. tetani (causes tetanus), B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. anthracis (bacteria causing anthrax)."

61128,Best comedy show on Netflix,I LOVED Misfits in the first two seasons and quickly lost interest in season 3. Can you give it a go convincing me to come back to it? It always bothered me that I never finished.

13876,best research paper archive,"[Evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/19/12252.full.pdf+html) of van der Waals forces in gecko setae.

Rarely do you see evidence presented so simply. Hopes for setae dry-adhesive products in the future have sky-rocketed since this paper."
68412,best science fiction novel,"I'm in agreement with u/VanyaKmzv.

Book of the New Sun is my favorite series of all time. I read the first two books in highschool and found it incredibly interesting but couldn't stick through to the end. I started it over again as an adult and just couldn't put it down. Once you lock in to Gene Wolfe's imagination, his writing becomes so incredibly clear and his characters all have a uniqueness to them that I don't see replicated often. I got busy with work and need to get back into the Sun books, but Long Sun is also amazing. Someday I'll finish it and read Short Sun."

39072,best web browser,"Opera is the best web browser. No doubt! I too like Vivaldi, but it needs time to compare with Opera."
