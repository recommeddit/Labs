"Maybe I’ll watch cowboy bepop after all!!
Thx for sharing"
I literally bought this one an hour ago from Best Buy for my build that I'll be putting together tomorrow. It looked noticeably more vibrant than the other displays and the size is perfect!

"Sorry, read that as tomatoes...."
When is a bundle size too big? Honest question. I can’t really find a straight forward answer on that on the “Googles”. I’ve worked on one project where the bundle was 4 MB and didn’t notice any performance issue unless we tested Chrome in Slow 3G configuration.

"I'm betting that the orange juice is for the vitamin C. Just take it in tablet form, I find the orange flavoured chewy ones to be quite pleasant. 
This is a well known remedy but do not use it for sick kids, raising their body temperature that much can be really dangerous."
"Already saw it along with Memento!
I guess every Nolan's film is great!"
"My dad likes edible things, so this year I bought him an exquisite chocolate truffle collection for his birthday/fathers day since it lands around the same day. He lives too far to visit and I don't have enough funds for a plane ticket. As a college student myself I'm pretty broke. He'll love it though."
Thanks so much man I really appreciate that!
"Now what do you consider ""current MCU""?"
Don't let the kids grab if you think you might run low. They'll take a handful each.

Some Thai restaurants serve ginger ice cream.

"Check out this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_I_university) from Wikipedia. It is a separate classification system than the one that US News has. 

I heard of additional criteria of becoming an R1 school, such as being a member of the [Association of Research Libraries](http://www.arl.org/about). If you look on the list of libraries, it is likely that the school is also R1. This website is also really great because you can look up statistics about the schools related to their libraries. For example, how many journal subscriptions they maintain and such. It is important to consider this because it means the more subscriptions they have, the less likely it is that you have to pay for an article or subscription on your own.

Other characteristics of an R1 school include accessibility of research opportunities to undergraduate students.

I haven't heard of any category less than R1, although that isn't to say that it doesn't exist."
"Team isnt good on paper but the results you produced was exceeding expectations during the last few years. In other words, exactly the contrary of Morocco and Egypt."
Ask a Mortician- Caitlin Doughty is a US based mortician all about breaking  taboos and getting us all talking about death. Wonderfully macabre without really being too morbid. She's written a couple of books since and I'm an absolute fan girl.
"The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10-20.

The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the gsp370. Which is closer to 100hours 

Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth.

Wireless headphones are Bluetooth. Often called headsets but that's just because they have a built in call grade mic. Not good for gaming. Bad mic quality and too high of latency."
"First game as best game isn’t necessarily true. I started with Yellow, but my favorites are Black and White."

Archer or arrested development would be good choices.
I think grey would awesome with pink accents in the room!
