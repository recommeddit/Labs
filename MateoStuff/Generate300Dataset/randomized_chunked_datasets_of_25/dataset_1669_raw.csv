Obligatory 'money doesn't buy happiness' I understand you want to support your family but this is your life we're talking about.
"Ironic, seeing as Mr. Fishburne's daughter fucks people for a living now."
You should try soap first...
PREY is so fun it’s like if Bethesda made Bioshock
"I'd be a little surprised if they can actually pull off sweeping this under the rug. Fans of opposing teams are gonna be all about bringing up the allegations during games and even a lot of Texans fans (on reddit at least) seem uncomfortable rooting for the team when Watson is present. 

Either way I guess we'll find out pretty soon if the league will step in or not."
"For me Winter Solider is probably my favorite, my worst is Captain Marvel. CA:WS still has some of my fav action and I just love the tone it has. Cap Marvel is just unforgivably bland imo."
Almost everyday. Even though I've grown up with the internet I could never give up the newspaper.

"I think I'll go with Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun, thanks for your input!"
Cleopatra is my favourite! Such a beautiful scent!
"As far as sad comics go, that's among the very best I've read, and with a bit of guilt as someone who has enjoyed Milne's original works and even the Disney bastardizations. That was a punch in the gut."
"I like Cydia too. But after using zebra, you can actually realize that Cydia is becoming deprecated. But it is still very good and stable."
Holy Pandas by far.
"I'm interested in a 4k G-SYNC display, preferably with refresh at least up to 144Hz. The reason is I plan to keep upgrading my gfx card (currently 1080Ti for display, and extras doing processing).. and although I'm most concerned with productivity uses, I like high refresh rates and occasionally game.

I believe a few such displays exist - and sometimes can be had for under $1000 - but I haven't seen a lot mentioned about them, since they're still kind of niche. Some detail I'd be interested in is e.g.: sure it's G-SYNC, but are these displays actually able to drive 4K at 144Hz? Even if I could see my mouse cursor and dragged windows looking smooth on the desktop, that's important in terms of being satisfied. Otherwise it'd be an expensive disappointment."

Sega Rally on Model 2.
I also don't prefer people smelling of BO at the gym. Good hygiene and deodorant is all you need at the gym
The yes was referring to me canceling my order and switching or the price lol

"Depends on what you are looking for. If you are not going to leave the resort to sightsee/explore then it doesnt matter what country you go to, look for the resort that gives you the most of what you want. IF you are a foodie look for lots of restaurants, if you are a beach person get a great , long, seaweed free beach with enough loungers so you dont have to wake up at 5am to save them, if you like to party get a resort that has sister resorts closeby that all use the same disco so there is always nightlife.

Some of my favourites. Majestic Mirage/Elegance or Colonial in Punta Cana, Sandos Playacar in Playa Del Carmen, Barcelo Maya Colonial Riviera Maya, Hard Rock Riviera Maya."
