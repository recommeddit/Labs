"I currently have an X but want to change to something newer. The 11 feels heavy and the bezels really stick out to me for some reason. I tried the 11 Pro but couldn't stand the different material on the back, it was like a bar of soap, and I never use cases. It also felt too heavy compared to the X.

I'll either stick to my X or try an 11, the ""SE 2"" is also appealing to me for next year, I really prefer Touch ID."
I want that more than any present lol

Their naming 'system' is so obtuse that I could never be bothered to try and figure it out. Thanks for doing the legwork.

"Dave Grohl came into the record store I used to work at on my day off, so I missed it (ughhh) but got the play-by-play. One of my coworkers didn't recognize him at first, but then did, which lead to the following conversation: 

Coworker: Hey man, is there anything I can help you fi- HOLY SHIT, you're Dave Ghrol!

Dave Grohl: haha yeah.

Coworker: Oh man, I totally did not play that cool. Umm... uh... Oh, is there anything I can help you find? 

Dave Grohl: I'm good, but thanks! 

They left him alone, but at the end when he was checking out, he offered to sign some stuff or take pictures, which everyone took him up on. Super chill, super nice guy apparently.

Edit: Grohl"

Idk how either our attack is decent but our defense is made out of wet paper bags
"Sorry for the huge post, but pencils are one of my favourite things!

Get a few hardnesses of pencil, HB is middle; B is soft & H is hard. I usually have an HB, a 2B and a 4B. 

A good quality sharpener - cheap, crappy ones can make life a misery and stop you getting a nice point on your tip. 

A really good quality eraser is worth the little bit extra and should be lifting the graphite off the paper - without needing a lot of force or damaging the paper. 

Also, buy some cheap cotton gloves and cut the thumb, pointer finger and middle finger bits off. If you wear it while drawing it really helps keep the smudging from your hand to a minimum, and the oils from your hands coating the surface of the paper. 

Post-it notes are great as re-positionable masks, and so is scotch brand sticky tape.

Get some decent quality paper, have a look at the ""grain"" of it, is it bumpy or smooth? Is it uniform or organic? ; and it's weight: the weight is the best indicator of thickness: 80gsm is what printer/copy paper is, and the ""cartridge"" paper I am using at the moment is around 160/170gsm. It's really what you like using. 

Good quality supplies are not always the most expensive, but ""student"" quality is generally at the cheap and nasty end of the spectrum. Not sure where in the world you are, here in Australia initial startup cost would look a lot like this:

1, Visual diary (sketch pad, A3 size) between $10-$15

2, 3 x Pencils, (graphite, sketching pencils) purchased individually, about $2 each. Coloured pencils are a different price and I use prismacolour or derwents. These can be bought either in packs or individually, they are well worth the cost, and can start at $2.40 on up. There are a lot of different sized and costed packs. 

3, Eraser, anywhere between $2 and $5

4, Gloves about $4 pack of 2 pairs.

5, Sharpener about $3 for a good quality one.

For these bits: approximately $30. 

I also keep a french curve template with my gear, and a math/geometry set. I am a bit clinical in how I approach subject matter, but most people aren't. These can be everywhere between $2 and $15.

Most importantly, you can build up a stash of tools, the wonderful thing with pencils is they don't dry up and don't disintegrate over time. 

Have fun!"

"Very true. The Washington Pass Overlook is stunning and is just off the main road.

However, OP suggests ONE and I picked ONP.

On a good day Mount Rainier is also phenomenal."

Atom won't be free when version 1 comes out but it will be worth the price IMO.
"I've honestly had more problem on two phones in the last two years (flagship phones from Google, too) with USBC than I've ever had with microusb. I have a suspicion that the female port needs to be made of harder material now than previously, since a bit of stress will expand it and make it harder for the plug to stay in, which the asymmetric old cables don't suffer from. That, combined with the myriad of different standards that all fit within the same cable had definitely made this generation of cables the most troublesome and confusing"
