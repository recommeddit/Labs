55395,best action and adventure novel series,"When he was building a following, there were a ton of short stories he release for like $1 each.  I just looked and couldn’t find them.  One of the titles I remember was “We only need the heads.”  He may have put them together in something more marketable."
65128,best phone service company,"I’m not sure if it’s changed, but at one point TMobile had limits on what percentage of the time you could be roaming (I think 50%). If you hit that for more than a month or two, they’ll kick you off the service. My sister got removed from our family plan because of it"
33054,best energy drink,Powerthirst! Because I want to be UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC!
9024,best toothpaste,"They are like coral.  The hardened plaque (calculus/tartar) is their home.  Built by them.  On your teeth and under your gums.

Pretty soon, the fish and eels will move in."
41009,best instrument to play,"I've played the drums for 14 years, but I could have been the drummer for AC/DC in less than a year of learning. Starting is very simple. The most important thing is not rushing out dragging. However, the ceiling is incredibly high because you have people like Danny Carey who as insane limb independence and also uses snare solo music to practice double bass."
23081,best celebrity,"Lady Gaga's mom (Cynthia Germanotta) is the real deal. Worked with a youth homeless shelter and she stopped by for a meet and greet with the young people. I've seen plenty of celebrities at youth events (homeless or otherwise) show up, smile for the cameras, and ignore (or even be downright rude!) to the kids. 

Not her.

She made sure to have a ""moment"" with every kid -- and there were about 25 or so -- where she talked to them, looked them in the eye, and validated them. It made them feel so profoundly special -- not that they got to meet her but that she made it clear they mattered. Her foundation organized a big donation for the kids, too."
73397,best battery bank,Anker powercore slim
65895,best college in california,"Luckily their MSF program is only 1 year which is what i'm really targeting. Well worth the 1 year of tuition costs if I can get some aid and commute from my family's place in NoHo (sounds simple to me, probably insane to a native).

Edit: i'm looking for finance jobs"

65952,best college in california,We went 11-3 in 1975.
45329,best gaming system,You can't go wrong with any console. Tbh I'd probably get your kid a switch. An Xbox would be my second option since game pass is an amazing way to try a lot of family friendly coop games and not break the bank.
11023,best backpack for college,"Another vote for Timbuk2! I have their parkside backpack and it's been through hell and back with me and it's amazing. Suspended laptop/tablet pocket so it won't sit directly at the bottom of the bag, plenty of room to hold all of my textbooks, chargers, calculator, papers, etc and not fall apart."
65104,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Nook at lama dog
26025,best politician,"I mean one of the reasons its more expensive is because it isn't there as a first resort. It's usually overflow or providing a service not otherwise available. 

Do you a) build a new jail to host 10 prisoners for 100 million dollars and then upkeep is 10 million a year or b) send them to a private prison at a cost of 2.5 million dollars a year

because not everyone has the need or money for C) build a prison to keep 1000 prisoners for 50k ea."
6916,best iPhone,"Best: iPhone 4. It basically perfected the smartphone concept and took it from a slapdash, unrefined new thing and turned it into something we all can't live without. Other than antennagate it is the best phone ever made, period.

Worst: tough call between the 5c and the 6 / 6 Plus."
66338,best soccer team in the world,"That metric there doesn't make any sense, since it's based on number of games played, which nobody uses to judge european success. I mean, that table put us 3 positions below a team that has a CWC as their only european trophy..."
66057,best college in california,I could make a similar comment about every single UC school. Grow up and smell the reality.
67946,best science fiction novel,"As soon as I saw no Iain M Banks I just skipped reading any more...  I'm in Australia and don't know many people who have read them, but I usually see them in book stores so someone is."
63341,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,yes 64
33039,best energy drink,Idk if cocain  energy is sugarfree or not but look into that. Otherwise just get a mega monster (extra big can) or drink coffee
22006,best celebrity,I need details about Brady.
66000,best college in california,Global universities list has to do with research output. National Universities list has to do with undergrad metrics. The latter is the original list and generally is cited much more.
21761,best winnie the pooh comic,i think this is ganna give me nightmares man
4187,best text editor,"Atom? Free, easy to get, less branding then vs code, and pretty bare bones but you can build it up however you need it."
