"Of the ones I've visited: 

1. Magic Mountain — Having TC, X2, Tatsu and FT gives it the edge, despite generally shit operations. 
2. Great Adventure — Better run than SFMM, but Nitro and El Toro cannot save a less-impressive ride profile. Not a fan of the layout.
3. Texas — Great variety of coasters and well-themed. Texas Giant is in my top 10, Titan beats SFMM's Goliath, and I could ride Runaway Mountain and La Vibora all day. 
4. Fiesta Texas — Gorgeous park. Iron Rattler also in my top 10, and despite my dislike of B&M floorless coasters, Superman is a great ride.
5. Discovery Kingdom — Well, it looks nice."
