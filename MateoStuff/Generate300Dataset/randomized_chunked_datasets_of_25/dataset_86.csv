42596,"All I gotta say is this. Remember the scene with the killer and Stella? Where they exchange chilling diologue. End of season 2 maybe? 

That may be the some best writing and acting I’ve seen in television. They did such a great job making a realistic and terrifying psychopath. So many layers to that character.",best detective show
17535,"FANTASIAN on Apple Arcade is great, though it’s only the first part out now with the second part coming later this year.  Done by the some of the people that worked on the old Final Fantasy games.  Absolutely beautiful backgrounds that are all physical dioramas with the 3D sprites layered over top.",best iOS game

Back in the glory days I spent money on decks every month because I wanted to, but I haven’t payed a cent in the last 2 to 2.5 years due to lack of interest and lack of need. TLDR with patience you can play for free at a competitive level.",best iOS game

15924,">The lenses really are better than a $20 pair.

They're better than marked up sunglasses sold in a US store for $20, chances are $20 sunglasses in the store are equivalent to $4 online.

The game changes when you spend $20-30 online. You can get a high quality pair of sunglasses which are basically identical to $80-130 sunglasses.",best sunglasses for fashion

16216,"Someone else mentioned Sunski, but I wanted to write a separate comment recommending them (instead of a reply to their comment)! They’re about $55/pair. They come polarized! They have a number of designs to select from. They come with a lifetime warranty! So if they snap on you, send it back and they’ll give you credit for a new pair! If you scratch the lenses, they sell separate lens kits so you can easily swap them out! And they’re lightweight!

I’ve replaced 1 pair so far and I’ve gotten a few lens kits (for different colors).",best sunglasses for fashion
73830,"Agreed, I definitely got used to writing with my current iPad, (which is just a normal ipad with a first generation pencil).  I might try and buy a cheap paper-like protector just to test out and get a feel for.  However I do wonder how my handwriting would improve on the protector since it's definitely sloppier on the glass.",best matte screen protector for ipad
3180,"I just bought a used Microsoft LifeCam Cinema for $15 [off Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B002MCZJ78/ref=sr_1_2_olp?ie=UTF8&qid=1376931200&sr=8-2&keywords=lifecam+cinema&condition=used), although the seller has a pretty bad rating (62%). I figured for $15, it was worth a buy. And if there was something wrong with the cam, then I'd just dispute it on Amazon.

I don't know much about the webcam market, but I did a little shopping around and it seems like the Microsoft LifeCam Studio and the Logitech HD Pro C920 are the two flagships. There aren't that many other companies that seem to come close, as all the other webcams I've seen have well under 100 reviews on Amazon.",best webcamera
