41842,"Not to rain on your parade but 33 has always had an occult meaning. Especially in Christianity - Jesus died at 33 for example. Many things appear in triplets as well - heaven, earth, hell. Past, present, future. And I guess in a Dan Brown novel 33 somehow leads to the meaning of life for what that's worth.

That's not to say they weren't inspired by this song's lyrics somehow, even if it is about Dan Deacon tripping really hard. Writers can take influences from weird shit. Overall the show is heavily influenced by stuff like Twin Peaks and David Fincher but who knows how they thought up little details like missing ears. The whole dead birds thing for example reminded me of the game *Life is Strange* which is also heavily about time travel - going back in time causes much of the local wildlife to randomly drop dead just like in Dark. Whether they actually played the game or the dead animals thing is a reference to something else entirely I'm not sure though.",movies like Inception

52971,"**Smif-N-Wessun - Dah Shinin**. My favourite 90s New York rap album, which is definitely my favourite location/time period. The production by the Beatminerz is flawless, pure hiphop essence, with some of the best and hardest basslines hiphop has ever seen, hard drums and often fantastic and beautiful samples. Tek & Steele aren't the most lyrical MCs but they compensate with an array of hard flows and great chemistry.

Favourite songs: Let's Git It On, Bucktown, Stand Strong, Sound Bwoy Bureill, Timz N Hood Chek

**Sean Price - Monkey Barz**. My favourite rappers best album imo. Varied production but good through-out, with appearances from 9th Wonder and Khrysis, but for the 16 songs there are 12 producers. This somehow works pretty well, with many great beats that all serve as a challange for Sean P to tackle. Sean is on his best shit here, his flow is still pretty fast compared to later years, but he has certainly already grown into more of a character than he was in Heltah Skeltah's early years. 1000 ways to murder you rap paired with being pretty drugged out (*""E-pills, mushrooms, and dust /
Got that nigga Sean Price in the mood to bust""*), it makes for every verse to be pretty entertaining. Every verse has you laughing like he's cracking jokes then worried he'll punch you the next second. Some dope features too, including Rockness on Slap Boxing.

Favourite songs: Onion Head, Boom Bye Yeah, Heartburn, Slapboxing, Fake Neptune


**Organized Konfusion - Stress: The Extinction Agenda**. Pharoahe Monch is insane as an MC, and Prince Po is still great- to the point that if he was rapping like this on almost any other album, he'd steal the show. This whole album is a manifesto of unconventional flows, switching every few bars without ever slipping up. Additionally, the concepts are interesting and carried out in a great way. 'Stray Bullet' for example is a song written entierly from the view of a bullet, a concept Nas flipped for the perspective of a Gun, some years later. The beats aren't groundbreaking, but they do serve as great, typical '93 east coast soundscapes for Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch to go crazy.

Favourite Songs: Bring It On, Stress, Stray Bullet, Why, The Extinction Agenda

**DJ Screw - Blue Over Grey**. Really just a symbollic record for my love for DJ Screws music. I don't think any tape is particulary high above another, or at least not to an extreme extent; there are many others I'd be happy to put as #1 too. But this tape is one of his more grimey and heavy ones, especially one of the earlier songs, *Love Ones* is stupidly hard, a mix of an Ice Cube track of the same name, stretched out for over 10 minute and it's dumb hard and loud. DJ Screw when you're stoned is where it's at. 

Favourite songs: LoveOnes. That's it, everything else melts together consistently, in a great way. 

**DJ Shadow - Endtroducing . . . .**  My favourite instrumental hiphop album period. So many amazing samples, so many perfect songs. The drums on *Midnight in a Perfect World* are flawless to me, probably my favourite drums in any hiphop track, much thanks to how good that snare sounds. Great scratces, very atmospheric sound that's great if you're travelling or self reflecting, or just chilling even. Lots of the songs feel pretty nostalgic. 

Favourite songs: Midnight in a Perfect World, Building Steam With a Grain of Salt, Organ Donor, Napalm / Scatter Brain, Mutual Slump",best hiphop album
