1. Getting Things Done by David Allen

WHY: It gives you a tactical, step-by-step system on how to actually manage your tasks and get s**t done day after day.

PROS: It works. I've been using the system for years (pen and paper [wasn't great], then on the Things app [much better] and OmniFocus for the last few years [nice]).

CONS: It's bloody complicated, and people struggle with 'falling off the GTD bandwagon.' I know it took me years to 'get' the system and finally condition it into a habit. This was during the early years, mind you, today you have a buffet of apps and courses to help you ease into the system.

2. First Things First by Stephen Covey

WHY: GTD helps you get things done, FTF helps you get the *right* stuff done. The metaphor is that you don't want to race up the ladder really well, only to find at the top that it was leaning up the wrong ladder all along.

PROS: Helps you to understand the difference between what's important and what's urgent. Sometimes the big things aren't the most obvious things and you need to proactively work on them.

CONS: Can get a little touchy feely if you're not into that whole mission statement stuff. But I'd say give it a chance to know yourself better.

CONCLUSION: Read both, then work to *practice* them daily. A dash of implementation is worth more than a handful of theory."
"I sometimes wonder with that series where the line is between ""discussing sexism"" and ""being sexist"".  That series most certainly toes it.  Not only are women treated in a sexist manner, but every single one more-or-less lives up to that expectation, being easily manipulated, weak, and rarely actually accomplish anything in the narrative.  

There's something called the lamp test, where you ask ""would this narrative be functionally identical if you replaced the women with sexy women-shaped lamps"" and in the case of Prince of Nothing as long as you gave the lamps appropriately shaped orifices to be raped, I'm not sure it'd make a big difference.

I find that one a hard recommend sometimes, because it really is on that line."
I'm an instructor at a CC and I agree with this. CC's now have many online programs and its an accredited degree that will allow you to enroll in a state university.  You really do have to watch out for the ITT tech's Phoenix and other non-accredited diploma mills.
"You’re gonna be happy no matter where you are. Everyone wants to make friends and be social in the dorms their freshman year. 

That said, live in Chi- 5 or FT. In other words, your options should be San Nic, San Mig, Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and Santa Catalina (FT). You’ll make tons of friends in all of those

Manzanita is socially dead and a terrible choice if you’re a freshman. It’s all 2nd years who either have their friend groups or have social anxiety. Don’t live in Manzanita or San Raf as a freshman. It’d be a waste of your freshman year dorming experience. 

Live in one of the ones I mentioned above^ (chi 5 or FT). I did FSSP and lived in San Nic my freshman year and it was the best option for making friends. Everyone in FSSP is SO FUCKING SOCIAL, OUTGOING, AND FRIENDLY BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT TO MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS THEY CAN. 

FT is also very very very social and the best dorm if you like to turn up and party. By far the most lit dorm, although I will say it was rare to see people sober in San Nic on my floor. 

But tbh, all the freshman dorms are pretty similar. No bad option (except for manzanita and San raf)."
"As for The Endless, I would highly recommend watching Resolution first. The Endless is sort of a spiritual sequel to that, and while it won't fully explain it, it will definitely help you understand it better. Not to mention Resolution is pretty trippy as well."
"Wow, I wish more people on reddit were like you."
Wet water.
What industry is he working in to make said bank?
I thought the fluoride in water worked completely differently on the teeth than the fluoride in toothpaste.  Don’t they have two different purposes since one enters the bloodstream and one is applied briefly to the outer surface of the tooth?
A lot of talk about Mullvad. Where would you recommended getting started with it? (aside from downloading it obviously.)
"Theme Parks tend to have a broader appeal. You can't enjoy a day at SFMM if you don't like coasters where Knott's appeals to a lot more than that. They have fantastic food, decent shows, a cool Ghost Town area, fun family rides and coasters. I'd rather go to SFMM for the coasters but a lot of my non-coaster loving family members prefer Knott's."
Amen
"I make a ""long beach tea"", and my customers loved it that night, hated it the next morning.

White rum, vodka, gin, tequila, triple sec/Gran Marnier, splash of orange, splash of cranberry, simple syrup, and a lime wedge.

If LIITs don't do it for you anymore, step up to this. This will fuck you up."

"They discuss things like affirmative action, reverse racism, P.C. language, etc. It's nothing about white superiority."
Marty’s is my jam!! Their Thai chicken pizza saves me every weekend from my hangovers
Data Wing is phenomenal story telling for its format. I love that game.

That sucks too :( Guess we'll both be making journeys to great parks next year!
