"7 7/8 oz on the Huawei.  The Aukey, was from their website. I won’t have my hands on it for a month (it’s waiting in the US for me). 

An Amazon review said 46 grams (1.6oz) on their scale."
"I studied the rise of Hitler, fall of Weimar, start of WW2 at a level and absolutely loved it."
"Can confirm, work in a package testing lab, everyone here was headhunted while still in school and from what it sounds like their college was awful lol.. just a high demand/low supply type of thing"
I personally don’t trust any free budgeting app because if they aren’t charging you then how are they using data to make money? I also don’t see where an app can do anything special that you can’t do on your own

"After the French and Indian War, England started taxing the colonies (without representation) to help pay off the debts that arose from it, and we all know what that led to."
Ant-Man and the Wasp ranking above Doctor Strange seems especially odd to me.

I saw something as of July 23 that said Mindhunter was back on. Did something come out later than that saying no again?
"I'm the worst shopper... or what they bank on. I like Lowe's because of how bright everything is, how the store is laid out, and ultimately, I like the color blue over orange.  Yeah, I'm that guy.

Recently, I figured out that my HD had a better selection of wood than Lowe's, but that might've been skewed since there were more morons like me shopping at Lowe's than HD and bought out the good stuff.

I'd thought their prices on lumber would be close but found a deal the other day on 7/16 OSB at HD that was easily $7 less than at Lowe's.

I think Lowe's is like home repair with training wheels and HD is more for serious workers."

When we went 8 years ago, I think it was $100/person/night all inclusive off-season. Seemed kinda expensive (esp compared to free for the Marriott), but given that it was about 50 times better it was really a bargain.

Edit: Looks like their rates have more than doubled. Still probably awesome though."

"Universal Orlando. They have the money and the talent to really go all out on it. It is genuinely impressive and worth going for just that even if you skip all the rides. They really transform the whole park.

To a lesser extent, I've never been but I hear Silverwood is really great.

I don't how they've done the past few years, but halloween was the one thing I feel Kings Dominion did better than Busch Gardens Williamsburg. They really ramped up the scare zones the last time I was there during October (2016, I think) and they benefited greatly from having a bit more open space to play with."
"driving through Shasta-Trinity forest made my butthole slam shut. those gorges, and lack of guardrails... 

edit: however, it was gorgeous! similarly, driving north out of SF toward Petaluma during the evening twilight - that was the most beautiful drive I've ever been on."
"I met Russell at his 2nd book's book signing in NYC a few years back. I can confirm that he is indeed, a ""peach."" So very nice, and very very funny."

My Octopus Teacher. Beautiful cinematography in addition to a fascinating story.
"How were the top reviewers determined? I really value SU&SD's reviews & I doubt I'm in the minority. I'm curious why were they excluded

PS This is super neat - kudos!"
"I prefer Lowe's because they're closer to my house.

I prefer Home Depot because it's generally better stocked than the Lowe's near my house."

If you decide to go with a 2700x then get the 2700 and oc it yourself for additional savings. During the prime day sale I picked up my 2700 for ~150 bucks which was a 50 dollar savings over the 2700x at the time.
Man I love our defence.
