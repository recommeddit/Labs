Congrats!
For portable chargers (and earbuds) I always go for xiaomi. They have decent prices on gearbest and similar sites (not sure which of these is best for the US though). They tend to be excellent value for money with excellent build quality.
Even in that era it's not like big-budget adventure movies released every year. All the titles listed by OP were special event films that were regarded as unique. In recent years we've had The Mummy(Tom Cruise version) and Tomb Raider(the reboot) and now Uncharted is coming.

Poor Black switches don't get any love.
"I'd say you could also go with first Python, then Java to start out simple. Understanding OOP and then going to learn Python, starting without classes, sounds a bit weird to me. Though I started with Java too so it isn't that big of a difference."

Are you sure it was John Mulaney? Might've just been a tall child.
Thought that I wouldn't need the /s considering how ridiculous my statement was.
"I've been using the Apple Silicon Case and so far it's been keeping my phone pretty well protected! In the past, I have also used Otterbox Defender cases, and I also really like them, especially if you're looking to make sure your phone stays in good shape."
"Thin crust, large pepperoni with extra cheese and 3 sides of ranch. This is the go to order for Rustys for me. It tastes like high school ."
The last stand by Sabaton. Pretty much any Sabaton song will work.

Drinking tea and cuddling with a puppy on a comfy couch watching horrible movies that you would normally never own up to liking.
I had a friend tell me that he couldn't get reception in the middle of a city with Sprint.
I always get glass for my phones and matte for my iPad. Matte on the iPad is perfect for the Apple Pencil and hides the fingerprints way better which is a necessity for a tablet in my mind.

"Here's a (perhaps) interesting sort of last moment ""twist,"" from the movie **King Rat** --about a prisoner of war camp where a low-ranked, scheming soldier rises to power by being able to procure ""what's needed"" for the rest of the prisoners.

Throughout the film, this man has another highly ranked soldier as his ""arch enemy"" --a man who works feverishly throughout their imprisonment to bring the upstart down.  And always failing.

At the movie's end, when the POW camp is liberated and the soldiers are being trucked home to freedom the ""arch enemy"" is getting his final licks in, dressing down the ""King Rat"" who is now just a powerless underling again, and assuring the man that he was less than worthless.

That's when another soldier tells the arch enemy the truth/the twist:  That if it weren't for the King Rat giving him something to hate with all his heart, he wouldn't have found the strength to survive the horrors of the camp."
"Any time they go on sale for like $60, I stock up - I currently have 2 pairs in my closet for when my current pair die."
"I promise this question isn't a joke:

How do you not have shitty water being pushed into your nether regions, boy or girl? Since it sprays from the back, wouldn't it all just go forward? Also, doe it ever splash outside the toilet?"
"This was my pick as well. One of my few non-Yelawolf posts, bitches. Embrace it.

But really, I was just listening to this album today on my drive to and from school. Such a cohesive project."
"My mom got me a plant for my room, I thought it was a stupid idea. Worthless and a waste of money. I've had it in there for over a month now, it just makes everything calmer and nicer. Maybe I'm getting old, but I love it."
