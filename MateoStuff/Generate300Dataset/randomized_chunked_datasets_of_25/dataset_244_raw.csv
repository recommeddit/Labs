"Sub triple sec for the hypnotiq (because I'm not paying for hypnotiq) and you've got a ""trashcan."""
"Depending on what you expect to be doing during/after college, I'd invest in a leather messenger bag.   When you start doing internships/interviews, it looks a lot more professional than a backpack, and your schedule shouldn't be so hellish that you need to carry more than a laptop, a notebook and two books at one time."

"Cycling is a hobby of mine, and the cycling one is so on point that I die whenever I watch it"
"Not a woman, but I wear Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford and constantly get asked about it by women.  That's a bit expensive, but the other scent that seems to work quite well is regular old coconut essence from The Body Shop."
"Dang man, thanks for the list. Got a lot of movies i didnt think of on there!"
No may be I didn't phrase it right. I will game on the monitor I already have. But would it be a problem if my other monitor's refresh rate is not same with the gaming one?
"Ah! I wrote an article on this for the Chronicle of Higher Education right after graduating college. [Stop Asking Me My Major](http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Asking-Me-My-Major/63453/)

Curious to hear thoughts/feedback :-)"
"The Woods, Union Pool and Pine Box all fill that same niche."
I got blues without knowing and I regret the decision so much because of the sound. But ngl I do like how it feels so imma stick with it
I think it is second only to the oboe in that area.
"LPT: clothes/toiletries only in your checked bag, valuables/electronics in your carry on. Then you'll never worry or care if someone has opened your checked bag"
"Architecture.

Edit: In case anyone sees this and has experience with both pointing devices, what's best for 3D drawing applications, a mouse or a trackball? I've committed to learning AutoCAD in the summer after school ends next week and I'be been trying to decide what to get, upgrading from a wireless trackpad. Thanks"
"I am going to disagree on the point that no position can impact like a QB.  A GOAT candidate WR or RB can be more valuable and more impactful in the right situation. 

Edit:  Y'all can't think of any situation that ever happened where the #1 WR or RB was more important than any QB in the league?

In case you need help, RB has been MVP 14 times since 1975.  Jerry Rice is the only receiver to have won MVP, and Lawrence Taylor has also won."

"I strongly suggest you take a look at cyberghost and Mullvad. There are hundreds of VPN services. I wouldn't necessarily advise someone to give them all a shot. Assuming some VPN services are unsafe, unreliable or malware, your advice would include an unnecessary exposure to risk.

Corazon Cucina is the best ever and the public market is an awesome place to hang out anyways
"I think the best thing you can do is to truly treat her job like a real job (it is one), and split the work 50/50 when you get home. No trinket is really going to communicate that you appreciate her if you treat your work like the ""real job"" and her job as a 24/hour responsibility she's never allowed to escape."
