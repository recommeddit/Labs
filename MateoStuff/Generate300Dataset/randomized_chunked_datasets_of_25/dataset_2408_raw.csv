"I appreciate your answer and find only little to discuss.

Publish or perish is a problem, absolutely. But I would not ascribe the perceived lack of courage or innovation to a systemic problem of academia but merely to the survivorship bias. Innovation is only really distinguishable in hindsight. Besides that, there are parts of academia that need less innovation and more validation."
"> It's barely an RPG though, you can't design Geraldo

Geralt. And just because he's an established character doesn't make the game less of an RPG. Everything about its variable side quests, characters, lore, etc, was at a level of quality we rarely see. Compare Geralt to the Dragonborn of Skyrim. Yes, you can design your own character down to the minutest detail . . .but the game completely devoid of any role playing, morality, variable quests, or even memorable characters. 

> you can't really change his combat style, he's a jack of all trades. 

Well thats just plain false."
"Their branches aren’t as sturdy as, say, spruce or pines. Their branches and central core are prone to snapping in heavy or wet snow fall. 

I don’t know what the Midwest is like except for the Weather Channel pics showing snowpocolypse."

"Depends on the game pretty much. I get enough FPS to justify a 144hz with the games I play. I do have to turn down settings but the smoothness is worth it. I have a 780 GTX Ti 3GB, tend to bench mark similar to the 1060 I've found."
"I love how he calls her that! 

I highly recommend the audiobook too because the narrator, Nicholas Boulton, doss an amazing job. He really brings Christian and his struggles to life!"
"Firefox and Waterfox provide more UI customizability than Chromium-related browsers.

Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave these days support nearly all Chrome extensions. Vivaldi provides the most UI customization of them."
Polo red is good too.
"The problem with these habits books is that they don't give you any smart advice about how to do stuff. What is something smart you can do about sleep? About diet? 

Sure they tell you about will power, putting in the effort to tracking your habits. Anyone can figure that out on their own. How about teach me something smart to do?"
"I mentioned Cricket in the video! While I haven’t tried Pure TalkUSA myself, their new prices are lower than Cricket’s for 5GB ($30 vs $35). Since I could only chose one plan for the video, I went with Pure TalkUSA’s cheaper plan. 

Cricket is still great, and perhaps deserves the recommendation if Pure TalkUSA’s experience is poor, but I thought it would be better to give Pure TalkUSA the nod for this one and focus on Cricket for my best family plans video and my dedicated 5GB video."

"Odd, have you tried adjusting the graphics settings like AA and shadows? Those always going to be huge performance hogs. 

turning off shadows and moving to a lesser AA would probably give you better results. 

Start at one of the lower presets and turn things up and see what happens. 

I have a 980Ti with a 4790k so I can get a solid 60fps at 1080p with adjusting some settings that I don't care for, but most are maxed"
"Hold on a sec before you do that. 

I suggest you watch the English Dub, because the voice acting and audio is better and improved, and the writing is better. And before you watch it you should know it is more than just depressing like Your Lie, pancreas, or Silent Voice.

Elfen Lied is know to be more than just depressing but actually emotionally break people and is psychologically disturbing. It's known to really fuck with people's heads for a long time. 

You may not want to watch it out of nowhere, I'd wait till you're in a reasonable state of mind.

(Also the OVA is a must watch, though it's voice acting is pretty bad. It's Episode 10.5)"

"The 6 series was the absolute worst and it isn't even close (imo of course). The 5c was a phone I wanted to like. If only it didn't have the outdated innards.

I wish we had more plastic phones."
I second this! Definitely my favorite pizza in SB.
"Side note: Raiders has one of my favorite scenes from a movie, when Jones is running from the natives with the idol in tow, and he's trying to get Jock to start the plane in time."
"Buy fresh ciabatta bread, soft and nice. Slice it up in pieces just about 3 cm thick and put them in a hot frying pan with lots of olive oil. When one side is a bit brownish, throw in some more olive oil and turn the fuckers around. When also the other side is goldie brownie, put them on a plate and cut in just a little bit of mozzarella cheese if you want to. 

Then cut some garlic, tomato and basil and put them on a hot pan with lots of olive oil. Let the mix warm up but put the heat off before they start to get some color. Take a spoon and stack the tomato mix thing on top of the bread slices and you're done. Put on some pepper and enjoy it with whatever the fuck you like.

Tip: when using tomato, sprinkle just a nip of sugar on the tomato when it's cut. It takes away the bitterness and gives the taste a little more.. something.

Edit: sorry, this isn't something you live with the entire day, but I usually team this up with any Italian dish or salad/seafood. A creamy pasta with salmon and prawns is one of my favourites."
"Depends on if you mean for society as a whole or for the individual.

For society it'd probably be a STEM field, business, economics, medicine, and anything else that can provide a large measurable benefit to the person as well as the world at large.

For the individual it would be anything that can give the individual a future where they can be successful while also enjoying what it is that they do. If Art History is their only passion, then Art History is the only choice that makes sense. I've seen way too many people get degrees that they hated and enter into jobs that they hated even more. It really boils down to:

(Marginal increase in income due to getting degree) x (Marginal increase in happiness due to working in that field)"
I like your ñ.

"I have never driven my EV on a journey for 7 hours straight where it would be an issue. 

However, I do live in the middle of the UK where you fall in the ocean if you drive 7 hours in any direction...

And chargers here are not that rare that it would cause any major anxiety. I'd rather drive in comfort and stop 30 mins sooner if I needed to. But so far I have charged the car a total of twice away from my house in 4 months of ownership. Most journeys just aren't that far."
