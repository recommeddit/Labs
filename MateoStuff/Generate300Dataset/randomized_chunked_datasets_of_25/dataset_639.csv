68335,best science fiction novel,"It's the first one I read. The only other one I read was *The Dispossessed*. They were only loosely connected, and all sources say as much for the whole series. Same universe, different planet, basically."
55552,best action and adventure novel series,"I found this in the gutter when I was younger and ""rescued"" it to my bookshelf.  It's a bit smudged in places, but was still one of my better finds."
53929,best medicine for a cold,"So to simplify all this, when I first get a cold, just a runny nose with no colored phelgm, take zyrtec to stop the production of mucus.

If it reaches sinus infection, take advil cold and sinus? I was desperate and right now I have a mild cold and took advil cold and sinus along with an anti histamine (claritin, not working) and nasal spray. Is that bad? My phelgm still clear."
52633,best hiphop album,That original post gave me serious anxiety.

69943,best major to study in college,"Pros:

Very interesting and diverse classes. I took everything from history of economic thought to economics of terrorism. Along with the more analytical classes of course.

You have a wide array of careers to go into afterwards.

A lot of what you learn is applicable to real life.

Cons:

You better be good at math AND english. Its both writing and math intensive. You can't just be a creative or analytical type of person. You must be well rounded. 

Good luck. I have done everything from finance, to accounting, to owning my own business with my degree."
