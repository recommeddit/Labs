"Ultraviolet by Paco Rabanne.
I've received compliments on it, but smell it for yourself."
"It was like 5 minutes in class, a note about the introduction of repeating small arms, and the territory we gained"
"Your major is a much bigger factor in your salary/employability after graduation. If you decide to go to graduate school then the prestige of your undergraduate school is unimportant. On the other hand, if you were hypothetically determined to become a banker out of undergrad, then your undergrad school would be important. It's the same way for most top jobs/companies.

My two recommendations would be to first add some hard skills to your curriculum (whatever those skills may be). Second, only apply to an MBA program after having management experience (might sound counter-intuitive, but employers like concrete evidence you're an effective manager)."
Anker or Aukey are clear shots for the best.
All of them.
Running a campaign with my wife for Gloomhaven JOTL and we are loving it. Great game and now that we’ve gotten the swing of things it’s quite addicting. She’s playing Red Guard and I’m Hatchet and it’s a blast.

A Tale of Two Sisters
This seems perfect. Thank you
"Hey, I love season 4. I admit the big bad isn't the best, but I think Riley gets a bad rap. He was the rebound guy. Despite what xander may have told Buffy, he was always the rebound guy, and in that capacity he was fine. Additionally I don't think beer bad is as awful as everyone says. There are also some of my favorite episodes of the series: something blue, a new man, restless, superstar, fear itself. It has spike join the regular cast, which is awesome, and even a terrible episode like where the wild things are has it's moments like Giles' coffee house gig. Season four is essential."
"Do your research on hamsters. They need a very large tank (40 gallon minimum) and nearly all species need to be solo. They are funny inquisitive creatures. Having a large tank with room to burrow and explore helps with the smell and with their aggression. A bored hamster in a small cage will bite. 

I kept rats for a few years. Very intelligent, can learn their names and simple tricks. Must have at least two at a time since they are social creatures. Males will mark their territory. They also need a lot of space for the same reason a hamster does. 

Personally I wouldn't trust a 7 year old with either of these critters. I'd start either smaller like fish or sturdier like a ball python."
Any awesome extensions for Safari?
"The pH likely would only change in a very small way if at all. Especially with bottled water. You probably wouldn't even have a test that's sensitive enough unless you work for a college with an expensive chemistry lab. 


The pH only starts to change dramatically when it's something like sea or polluted water, which has a lot of stuff mixed in. (Like I'd you scooped out water from the toilet, you'd likely have either human waste or bathroom cleaner mixed in, which would affect the pH)."
"Try to find a new one...it may be cheaper because they are trying to gain popularity, and by nature less likely to be broken down.  As for reviews, I always find yelp and trip advisor to be helpful."
"Slightly off topic... but ever notice how much paste they put on the brush in commercials versus what amount the recommend on the label (""pea-sized"" amount)? Not only are they convincing us to buy a product that may or may not be of any benefit, but they've also convinced us to waste it so we have to buy more. From a marketing standpoint, these guys are brilliant!"
"Hmmm, I checked his account and he skateboards in Dubai and takes pictures in the Himalayas with an Iphone 7 plus"
I gotta relisten to the album but I liked it so I'll definitely go back to it from time to time
MBDTF by kanye for sure. I like the production on that album more than (some of) the rapping
That was like 5 years ago.
"Did they ever resolve the leaking/water bypassing filter issue with their products? WAY too many reports on the forums of bad filters not properly bonded, combined with poor customer service when it was discovered."
"My wife and I each got a Dell 2716DGR (1440p 144hz G-Sync flat screen) a year ago and love them for both gaming and productivity. (Paired with RTX 2080 cards) I think these are really underrated.

Edit:  Forgot to add that it often sells for under $300 US, usually when Best Buy puts them on sale! But that was before coronavirus started messing with production and demand, so I don't know if you'll see that price any time soon."

So it depends of the silicone?
