If you enjoy GTA I'd highly recommend Red Dead Redemption. It was my fav game on 360.
"Where do you see that in the words ""all time top European clubs""? It just means the top teams in Europe over all of football history, taking everything (including the strength of the competition etc.) into account."
"There's Sage Math for the iOS. It's free, but requires an internet connection, and it's not as user friendly. [Here's](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html#sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d.plot3d) some examples of input/outputs.

Is anyone else here using Sage?"
"Hmm, interesting perspective.  I could see that.  I loved his shit-eating grin too."
"Alright, thank you."
"Arch enemy, dying fetus, slipknot, cannibal corpse, first blood, slayer, parkway drive, mostly these bands"
"Fetch does not support progress callbacks. 

Maybe instead of pretending that you're superior to everyone you should understand that people use things for a reason."
"That country welcomed me with open arms and I would be nothing without it today. Completely different experience for me.

Also,

> there is racism coming out the yazoo

This is true for just about every country out there."
"I think I gave a RotRing a scribble in-store to test it, but I don't own one myself. The weight of a metal exterior is nice, but I don't typically like the ""knurled"" texture of the grip."
"I like that idea, now to think of something in a week..."
I don't know that I would ever consider missing a coaster as lucky.  I don't know when I'll have a chance to ride it again and even if it's painful I gotta try everything once.
"""Center"" in most cases just means a watered down version of what the left and right propose. Why would anyone  pursue this ""philosophy"" ? (it is more like the lack of one). The only reason someone should be a centrist is if they don't understand the other positions.

That being said, stop thinking that major, national news outlets are somehow more reliable or truthful than small independent outlets. The longer a news source has been around, the longer it has had a chance to be corrupted by the powers that be. The more popular they are, the more motivation to corrupt them. All the major US outlets release suspect information from time to time."
"Actual cough suppressants (other than things that soothe the throat, like Zarbees) are NOT recommended for children."

"I don't think so. Season 2 has been much more divisive.  


But I'm ""worried"" about the Gloomhaven top 3.  


To be fair I think these lists are less and less relevant. People slaps 10 and 0 left and right nowadays."
Are you an Eagles fan?
The $90 price is the plan listed with the $10 auto-pay discount applied. I chose to list all plans with their auto-pay discounts because they are easy enough to get. I would LOVE to find a way to factor in the taxes though to get the true cost of the plan.
"Thanks, I didn't know this was a thing!"
the albums just got more soul than a sock with a hole
We need this in the US. It would be so rewarding to see asshole drivers publicly shamed.
Chloe by Chloe (the original one in the gold bottle) is my absolute all time favourite! My husband wouldn't notice if I smelled like cat litter but female friends comment on this.
