"Did I break a rule or something? 

Why is this getting downvoted? 

Edit: I'm pretty sure it was /u/jaharm. They posted a direct link to some pillows at the same time without any comments. That post received 12 upvotes in under an hour. A review of /u/jaharm's profile reveals they only post links (usually direct to a purchase page, but occasionally youtube videos) have never made a comment, and is less than a month old. 

I suspect they are a corporate shill, and are manipulating votes.

**BEWARE!**"
"I entered into my relationship with my wife, who only ever bought cheap 5.00 pillows from Walmart, with a quality/expensive pillow.  She swore up and down she'd never buy one.

Eventually said pillow migrated over to her side of the bed and was the one and only time in 8 years of marriage that she's admitted to being wrong."

What? Setting the bar higher for out of state residents makes 0 logical sense. If the problem is the admissions and the money then the way admissions work should be changed. It's corruption. You fix corruption by changing the core problem. Not something associated with it

"This is a bit like choosing a girl to fall in love with, it's hard to engineer. I'd say you should watch a few matches and see if you suddenly catch rooting for one side rather than the other. That being said, I'll give you a run down of the biggest clubs. Note: I don't really have a clue what I'm talking about, and apart from this, nothing I say should ever be taken seriously by anyone.

* **Real Madrid**: has won 10 Champions League titles, more than anyone else. Their fiercest rivals are Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. They sign big names, galácticos, and have one of the biggest fan bases in the world. Also, [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDPVBprjFo), the world's best player in 2013 and 2014. And you can't really go wrong with James, Isco, Modric, Bale, Ramos, the little pea or the central defender prodigy that is Varane. Top three in both team quality and club size. 

* **Barcelona**: as of right now, perhaps the best team on the planet, their run in the last months has been fantastic. [Messi, Suarez and Neymar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeRThkiCK7E) in attack is almost like cheating. This team would be more top heavy than a woman with giant breasts and small everything else, but their defence is almost as solid as the attack is good. Top three in both team quality and club size.


* **Bayern München**: won the Champions League two years ago, along with the Bundesliga and the German cup, completing a treble. The biggest German side, they have a formidable history. They've got [top quality players all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhBnkyt7-o), and a lot of players from the German side that won the world cup. Not to mention a [keeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIGqcIYvq6M) with his own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/justneuerthings/) Top three in team quality.


* The fourth team I want to mention is **Arsenal**. Famous for their optimistic and [fluid football](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16uyix_arsenal-vs-norwich-4-1-jack-wilshere-s-goal-of-the-season-hd-720p_sport). You can count on them to always get to the knockout rounds in CL and they will [always almost go through](https://www.google.no/search?q=arsenal+almost+champions+league&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=JX9HVYLgLoWasAHKz4GgDQ). Rivals: Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and 15 more London clubs.


* Then you have **Manchester United**, easily one of the most recognizable clubs in the world and the most successful English club. Struggled last year after the great Sir Alex Ferguson retired after nearly thirty years as manager. With the [eccentric Dutchman Louis van Gaal](http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/05/21/british-journalists-follow-these-ten-rules-for-interviewing-louis-van-gaal/), they are in a good position to qualify for next years Champions League. Top three in club size. Rivals: Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal.


* The second most successful English club is **Liverpool**. They have a great history, and I hear they'll have a great side next year.


* While Serie A is in a bit of a rough patch right now, there are still plenty of great teams in Italy. **Juventus** just won the ""scudetto"" for the 31st time, making them the most successful Italian side. With players such as [Buffon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY9t8n2b_w4), [Tevez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEwgKAPow9w), [Pogba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMxPphrgeu8) and [Pirlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkyC9ZdHjaU) it's no wonder that they won. 



* But wait, there's more! Even though they're not that prominent in the US (yet), **SK Brann** from Norway is a club of high quality and mediocre values. Except for a minor setback with relegation last year, Brann is now en route for coming third in the highly acclaimed OBOS-ligaen, thereby securing the right to enter a qualification cup with the teams in 4th, 5th and 6th where the winner will face the club that ended at 14th place in Tippeligaen. So you can say it's getting pretty serious. If you start now, you'll be joining on the way up and that's way more fun than jumping on the bandwagon when we win the Champions League in 2019.

Look at all I've written, and I have still neglected several great teams such as Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, PSG, Lyon, Ajax, Celtic and Roma. And I have failed to mention several good leagues.


TL;DR it's up to you, buddy. And we all know what you mean by ""soccer"", don't worry about it.



PS! Bayern will face Barcelona and Real Madrid will face Juventus in the semi finals of the Champions League soon, watch those games. Additionally, Chelsea will face Liverpool next week, and Arsenal after that. Manchester is going to square up against Arsenal the 17th.

"My house cactus is a soldier. He straight does what he wants when he wants. I haven’t watered that thing in a bit and he’s still chugging over there. I never will double cross that bastard. I thought about getting rid of it one time, and that night I bumped it and stepped on it walking in the dark. That was excruciating pain, pulling those little prickles out of my foot."

"Just spent under $100 on bike pants. If you have a bike, bike pants will go a long way to making that a better experience. And if your butt is in shape, it will at least get you an appreciative fan base. Also, if you are one of those people who have a mountain bike but only ride it around town, invest in some good road tires, it will get you there faster with less effort."
"Oh, I get that it's all security theater. I just think it's ridiculous that you can *circumvent* that security theater for a fee.

Makes the whole security theater more of an extortion scheme. ""Hey, for a small fee we have a solution for this problem we created ourselves."" Only difference is instead of trashing your shop and breaking your leg they trash your bags and fondle your balls."
