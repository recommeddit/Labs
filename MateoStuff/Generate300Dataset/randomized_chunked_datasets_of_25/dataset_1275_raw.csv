AAAAAHHHHHH MOTHALAND
"Maaannn, if I ever work a bar for a house party, my friends are fucked.

*hands drink* ""Here man, try this out!""

*sips* ""Bleh! What the fuck is this?!""

""Urine infection"""
What does that mean?
"You put so much work into this.  Thank you!

The fact that The Kiss Quotient was so favored really surprises me."
"Wow, an actual answer to this question.  I'm kind of sad I had to scroll this far down to find it."
"You can do that -- that is my default setup for giving lectures. But I would slightly prefer, if possible, a solution that doesn't require me to log in to multiple zoom accounts and remember which hosting, make sure audio/video is on/off on the right one, etc. The whole thing seems kind of stupid and clunky. It would be nice to just have a stylus be able to mark up PDFs on my single screen share."
Yes. Because that's the only way you'll practice enough to get good.
"I have a soft spot for my iPhone 3G but it was quite buggy and the camera was early 2000s webcam quality but the experience was like no other at the time. The iPhone 4 was probably the one I think of the most, amazing camera, decent battery life, beautiful screen, loved YouTube and other streaming apps over 3G with that device. The camera on the 4 is STILL good after all these years"
"> Cancun for many years, and the all inclusive resorts have been killing off the local restaurants and cultural offerings


You do realize Cancun and points south were specifically developed and designed to be a tourist and mega-hotel resort destination.  Prior to the hotels it was nothing but a few small fishing villages with not much ""culture"" to speak of.  If you want culture of Mexico you do NOT got to Cancun.  Merida, Guadalajara, Mx City, Puerto Vallarta (to some extent) and many others are destinations for cultural interest.  Going to Cancun and complaining about lack of cultural offerings is like going to Disney World and complaining about all of the pictures of Mickey Mouse."

Edit. (go to about 0:50)"
"When I first saw this video, I noticed [it matched the rhythm of Darude Sandstorm....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9bXHy4Dqj0)"
"I read Seven Eves because it was on Bill Gates' list. It was good, although I would have liked more detail in places, and I heard it stacked up well."
"That really isn't an ending. They call it that but the actual full game is after you keep playing and it has completely different content.  After you get ending C, D or E. The game actually ends after that."
"Thanks for the answer man! I’ve got a Nikon D810, could I connect it to the cam link and stream for 3 hours? Thanks"
"This might be kinda off topic.

But have you thought of getting a Kindle or Nook or some other e-reader? You say you end up sending so many books by mail ""back home"" when you leave, and try to be a minimalist(which I greatly admire, I'm in the process of decluttering).

Would an ereader help with this? One single item, no shipping, etc."
I’m happy to help!
Skate needs to come to the PC that would be amazing :O
"Hey man, I’m thinking of buying the Hayate Otsu V2 to replace my HyperX FuryS speed mousepad, do you think that it will be well worth the upgrade and money spent ? Tnx in advance"
"Mango trees.

I used to climb them to eat green mangos with salt. I was a weird kid."
"God yes. That movie is amazing. Honestly, that film is almost completely up front about the fact that his brother is dead (re: title), yet it was a complete shock at the end. Paddy Considine doesn't get the accolades he deserves."
"Cheers man, thanks"
"yeah that’s where I’m at. 

I was especially impressed by reports the base model range is calculated while pulling a half ton load. Empty the range is 400+."
"And then the Verge pulled a shithead move and tried to copyright strike a few youtubers for mocking said build video.   


THAT I haven't forgot."
Sounds great :) adding it to my list now.
"Looking for a large 4k 16:9 screen for coding. Seems like the only sizes I find on amazon are 32"" and 43"", is there anything in-between?

edit: needs to have usb-c/thunderbolt connectivity. I'd like to use the monitor for power deliver and some usb accessories"
