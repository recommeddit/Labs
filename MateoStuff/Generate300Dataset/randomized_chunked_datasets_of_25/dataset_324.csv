4736,"i usually just go to Lowes because it is closer to me and easier to get to.  
I don't really have a particular favorite. They are both very close in prices and both offer similar products. I will usually price match if it's something I can't get online and/or is a high ticket item.  
We bought our stove and microwave through Lowes and the process was fine, except they gave us the wrong model when they brought it up. Simple return process but we found out before we left the store.  Lowes does have more of a selection on the floor than Home Depot does, at least the stores I go to.  
Home Depot has a great online order and pick up in store system. It's a lot easier than doing it at Lowes. But this is just my experience at the ones near me.  
Personally, I wouldn't just pick one and stick with that store. Both may excel in certain areas and you can benefit from going to both. Also, for smaller things, check out Amazon. I was able to get a lot of stuff for our renovation through Amazon at a much cheaper price than the big box stores.",best home improvement store

Long answer meh.
  
Depends on the filter and how small of particulate filter they contain.  Most filters will advertise that they remove certain heavy metals and spores.  Are these things good to have in drinking water?  Probably not.  Does it matter in the concentrations that we are talking?  Probably not.
I also don't believe there are any scientific studies that demonstrate health benefits from water filter usage (there are studies demonstrating that the filters work, just not that it makes a difference to overall health).",best water filter

25265,"Tom Holland is an amazing actor and gives the role a lot of energy, but i still don't know how to feel about the MCU turning Spider-Man into Iron Man's apprentice/sidekick, making him very dependent on Stark tech.

From a legal perspective it's a smart move because it ties Spider-Man closer into the MCU by strongly associating him with Iron Man, when they know that Spider-Man still belongs to Sony but still making him an integral part of the MCU so that the backlash/cultural impact would be huge if he were to leave it.",best spiderman actor
