64034,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I would love some info on the hub on dc++ :) :) 

&#x200B;"
17226,best iOS game,For everyone saying WildRift. This game hasn’t been released yet. Just to clarify.
34450,best NFL player,It's also disingenuous to point out that defensive nerfing rules put in place to protect QB's like Brady has less of an affect than a lack of salary cap did for a team who drafted better than anyone else that decade.
54789,best water filter,are the big bottles not better value than filters ?
2371,best headphones,"If not in the top sound top four, the rest have all equivalent great sound so choosing by price should be wise."
44745,best items under $100,"This! I’m a dude, my first 100 blades lasted me 4 years of shaving my face year-round. I also use old-style shaving soap. 10$ of soap lasts me 4-5 years. So much better than buying cartridges."
4736,best home improvement store,"i usually just go to Lowes because it is closer to me and easier to get to.  
I don't really have a particular favorite. They are both very close in prices and both offer similar products. I will usually price match if it's something I can't get online and/or is a high ticket item.  
We bought our stove and microwave through Lowes and the process was fine, except they gave us the wrong model when they brought it up. Simple return process but we found out before we left the store.  Lowes does have more of a selection on the floor than Home Depot does, at least the stores I go to.  
Home Depot has a great online order and pick up in store system. It's a lot easier than doing it at Lowes. But this is just my experience at the ones near me.  
Personally, I wouldn't just pick one and stick with that store. Both may excel in certain areas and you can benefit from going to both. Also, for smaller things, check out Amazon. I was able to get a lot of stuff for our renovation through Amazon at a much cheaper price than the big box stores."
54995,best water filter,"Short answer yes.

Long answer meh.
  
Depends on the filter and how small of particulate filter they contain.  Most filters will advertise that they remove certain heavy metals and spores.  Are these things good to have in drinking water?  Probably not.  Does it matter in the concentrations that we are talking?  Probably not.
I also don't believe there are any scientific studies that demonstrate health benefits from water filter usage (there are studies demonstrating that the filters work, just not that it makes a difference to overall health)."
43435,best ad service for mobile applications,"I know Airpush has a pay per download option. I like them but I didn't like the permissions on their sdk. 

I just switched to Appodeal (I do only banners) and revenue seems higher than anything I've used. (their sdk doesn't need write permission btw)"
3924,best online college,"I think, at UOP, the understanding is that you are essentially purchasing an easy degree.  It really was very little work, unfortunately.  You can learn more in two weeks on www.codeacademy.com then I learned in my classes."
67697,axios alternatives reddit,"I see, gotta love those downvotes for asking a question  
Reddit community going strong"
49072,best gaming monitor,I have the Aorus FI27Q and love it. Don’t have a lot of room for a desk so it works nicely.
25265,best spiderman actor,"Tom Holland is an amazing actor and gives the role a lot of energy, but i still don't know how to feel about the MCU turning Spider-Man into Iron Man's apprentice/sidekick, making him very dependent on Stark tech.

From a legal perspective it's a smart move because it ties Spider-Man closer into the MCU by strongly associating him with Iron Man, when they know that Spider-Man still belongs to Sony but still making him an integral part of the MCU so that the backlash/cultural impact would be huge if he were to leave it."
34947,best NFL player,"It is legal. During the 2019 season, DK Metcalf caught a ball and almost hulked his way through a handful of 9ers defenders, but he ended up losing a fumble when one of the corners forced it while running out of bounds. 

https://youtu.be/S-OtHWvL8K0 at about the 4:52 mark."
37341,best amusement park,"This gives more weight to my ""Have Cedar Fair buy Mt Olympus and turn it into a regular park (with a large waterpark and a ton of hotel rooms)"" idea."
51358,best iphone case,"Yes its not very grippy but thats what i like about it because it goes in and out of your pockets so easily, but its also not super smooth either and its so sturdy. I think its just right. Im actually typing this on my 11 pro max with the Mous limitless case on. Waiting on my new phone to upgrade everything :)"
64022,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,I have never gotten an audiobook I wanted from the Overdrive system my library uses. They're always on hold or not available.
70880,best movies with a cool twist,You beat me to it.  Or am I dreaming?
28810,best breakfast foods,"Oooh, let me know how the apples turn out, I hadn't considered that. Did you add cinnamon?"
7256,best iPhone,"Personally, I'm torn, because in my personal opinion, the 11 pro is one of, if not the prettiest phone ever made, and the 12 pro, from everything I've seen just looks ugly with that LIDAR sensor.  

However, you're talking about base models, and the 12 is rumoured to come with 5g, and that alone makes it worth waiting for."
60956,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Red Dwarf was taken down. I about cried when I found that out, my number one favorite show for sure!"
73079,best Linux distro,"\#4. Installing Arch as a new-ish Linux user actually helps you understand the way Linux is structured, btw. So I'd advise to give it a shot **in a VM**."
2806,best headphones,"I didn't have any low volume issues on the mic. You may have something set up incorrectly. 

The flight and flight s are also better than most other wireless gaming headset.

All wireless gaming headsets suck, it's not about getting one that's good, it's about getting one that doesn't completely suck and the cloud flight and flight s sound good enough to make up for the issues."
36481,best alcoholic drink,It's a fair criticism: would be kidding if I claimed to never mess up a batch. One of the good things about this hobby is that the savings is so significant that it's worth the risk.
5024,best home improvement store,Depending on the size store near you. This can influence the assortment by 25%.
