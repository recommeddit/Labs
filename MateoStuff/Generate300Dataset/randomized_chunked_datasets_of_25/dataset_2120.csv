18049,best Kardashian,It’s fine to exclude him. He posted revenge porn to Twitter of the mother of his child. He’s trash.

57167,best water brand,The most real thing I've heard was when a Swiss rep of a university came to visit my highschool a few years ago was that he was shocked by how expensive Evian was here when in Switzerland the price is the same as the local water here.
46865,best hand santizer brand,"No, obviously if I have visible dirt hand sanitizer won't work well. I was referring to particles and residue you don't see that is still on your hand when you use hand sanitizer. 

I thought it was worth posting because I see too many people using hand sanitizer instead of washing their hands with soap and water."

44757,best items under $100,"1) My soda stream.

I like carbonated water - it’s about all I drink. High end soda stream from value village was $15, bottles and canisters have paid for themselves a dozen times over.

2) cloth diapers for my 2 month old son. Turns out he hates being wet, and we can easily go through 20 diapers a day. I’m sure we saved hundreds on disposables already. (Got my cloth diapers 2nd hand. Net cost is $0 because they can be re-sold after for the same as what I paid so long as I look after them)."
63893,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Comment removed per rules #9 and #1.
34411,best NFL player,"It's a legitimate answer.  Many consider him the GOAT defensive player or GOAT pass rusher.  If you value that highly, it could affect your decision on who is the greatest player.

Also, there is his influence as a player even outside of what he did on the field.  He revolutionized free agency."

73670,best battery bank,"If you find yourself ever carrying say a 20k instead of a 10k or something that needs a 30 watt charger instead of the 18 watt.

53518,best medicine for a cold,"Penicillin and the ones closest to it cause me to have anaphylaxis, which we learned when they gave it to me as an newborn and I stopped breathing. During my toddler years, they tried a few more on me and I kept getting hives or rashes and sometimes had difficulty breathing. When I was young, they did an allergy test with my blood and determined that I was allergic to all the ones they tested for, in varying degrees. There are some I can take for a little while, but I can’t finish a full course. All this information came second hand from my mother, as I was too young to hear it from the doctor. 

I should probably go and get another blood test done to see if that’s still an accurate assessment, but my family doctor, who worked very closely with the pediatrician responsible for these tests, still has only very reluctantly prescribed one type, and has insisted that I take two Benadryl with each dose, and I’m inclined to follow her lead as far as what I shouldn’t have."

You have to keep in mind that not every app can just be like, hey go download chrome 75 and use that only heh the fact of the matter is that people don't update their browsers or OS when they are not devs or more advanced tech users for example."

50753,best rap album,"I understand that but if my listening were to be of a similar volume I don’t think I’d absorb enough of each project to talk about ranking. This is all out of curiosity, clearly there is very different types of music consumption out there."
