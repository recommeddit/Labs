"Guitar. It's more versatile and you can bring it with you anywhere you go. Some chicks prefer the piano over the guitar, but if you're good and can sing, you'll blow them away. And they'll blow you  YEAAAAAAAAAAAHH"
"Definitely go for a test drive.  That's sometimes difficult in a Tesla, but see if you can find the local EV owners group and ask if anyone is willing to let you drive their car.  Sounds odd, but generally Tesla owners love to let people test out the cars (perhaps less so right now with COVID, the other option is Turo)

Also talk to the local dealers for the other EVs.  Some dealers are great about EV sales, some are truly awful.   I would not buy an EV from a dealer that doesn't want to sell one."
stop cutting onions :(
"Weird, I've used mine heavily for 1.5 years, now, and it's still going strong."
"Yeap. The data this map uses is kinda fishy if the UNC appears but the UBA doesn't. Furthermore, the Balseiro should be there. There's nothing like the Balseiro in LATAM. It's the mini MIT of Argentina."
Everyone has different reasons for using a web host tbf.
"NFS Most Wanted Black Edition 2005. Man that game was brutal with its police chases. 

Burnout Paradise for awesome open world arcade fun.

Assetto Corsa for hot lapping sim action."
"Second this. If your family has iPhones, you can use other video chat apps… many more budget and battery friendly options when you look into androids"

"Minneapolis would be good if you want to experience an NFL game in a new stadium and a NHL game too. If you're visiting in the winter, I recommend coming around December. It's winter wonderland here around that time. There's some places too that I (or anyone in /r/Minneapolis) can recommend to visit or eat at.

Otherwise, I would suggest going to New Orleans and/or Chicago. New Orleans is an amazing and beautiful city. Chicago is a great big city to get the feel of American culture."
"Useful in a practical sense?  Agriculture/farming

Useful in the real world?  Comp Sci/STEM/Business/Accounting/Stat/Math/Econ"
"I second recommendations of Wasserman, both Hastie et al s, Koen, McElreath. I think for generally useful core background what's missing from the list is:

Boyd, Vanderberghe - Convex Optimization

, which is best when accompanied by the respective online course.


From the statistics community specifically, not all-encompassing general, yet incredibly well written and very useful for in depth understanding of accordingly, likelihood and regularization:

Yud Pawitan - In All Likelihood

Wainwright, Tibshirani, Hastie - Statistical Learning with Sparsity"
Mini Almond Joy for the win!
Swallow a really long piece of floss and then wait.
OLED doesn’t play nice with my eyes. I prefer LCD. I’ve got an iPhone 11 and a Xiaomi Mi 9T(OLED) and I prefer the iPhone display.

"A community college will almost certainly be cheaper. To defer your federal loans you typically need to maintain full-time student status, so generally 12+ credits each semester. It looks to me like Kansas in-state tuition for CC students is about $75/credit...which is really very low compared to many other states. I don't think you'll find an online ""college"" that is any cheaper than that."
I read that as girls that are related to me and was concerned.

"I considered going back to school but my only real choice would have been online due to work schedule.  My bosses (including director and SVP, SVP over ~900 people) said not to bother."
