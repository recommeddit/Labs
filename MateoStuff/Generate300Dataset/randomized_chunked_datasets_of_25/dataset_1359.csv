35613,best alcoholic drink,"The crazy amount of sugar in the Gatorade will actually make the hangover worse.

Edit: I don't have a source I can link you to, and I can't imagine where I would find an academic paper or equally reputable source on the effects of combining Gatorade with binge drinking. My source is my own personal experience with seriously nasty hangovers that resulted in drinking a tried and true amount of alcohol where the only x factor was the addition of sugary drinks."

73210,best Linux distro,"I went from Kubuntu (2011-2014) to Manjaro (2014-now).  I do not regret starting with Ubuntu, but I think I would just have started with Manjaro nowadays.
