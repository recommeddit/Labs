I've had good results with heat. About 60% of the colds I've had in the last 8 years were treatable by hot nasal rinse or just bundling up under six blankets
"I mean, I had a TN panel as my primary for gaming before this, do all my singleplayer gaming on my OLED and have a lot of experience on IPS too.

The black level smearing exists, but only in scenes with extreme contrast and very fast motion. I primarily use the panel for competitive FPS and it's perfectly acceptable in terms of average g2g. Again, non-issue imo considering the monitor's specs. 

Would take this HDR1000 200hz 1440p ultrawide over any IPS panel on the market if we're disregarding price.

Having said that, I've used lower-end VAs at friends' houses before and some of them are literally unusable for fast paced games imo."

I love A Scanner Darkly. The film style is so unique that it draws you in even without the plot (which is intriguing for sure). I wish more movies were filmed (animated?) like that.

"This reminds me of an experience riding the elevator in a Mexico hotel with this tall tanned guy.  Dude was apparently in sevaral telenovelas and went to great lengths to explain his role. Didn't matter, I still didn't recognize him and after a while it seemed like this really disappointed him"
"I use axios for everything, which is amazing if you work a lot with Apis

A good pattern to use is creating an axios instance with all your defaults set, and then indeed only exporting functions to re-use.

If you have a standardized return format, you can also use interceptors to pre-format standardized responses.

    // /utils/api.js
    import Axios from 'axios'
    
    const axios = Axios.create({
      baseURL: url,
      crossDomain: true,
      timeout: 200000,
      withCredentials: true,
      credentials: 'same-origin',
      responseType: 'json'
    })
    
    axios.interceptors.response.use(
      async (response) => {
        if (response.data.ERR) {
          return Promise.reject(response.data.ERR)
        }
        return response.data.RSP
      }, 
      async (error) => Promise.reject(error))
    )
    
    export const getAccount = 
      (origId, acctId) => axios.get(`/orgs/${orgId}/accts/${acctId})
        .then(json=> json.ACCT)
    // the interceptor pre-formats your response. saves you tons of boilerplate.

[An example](https://github.com/doxick/eve-maps/tree/master/client/app/utils/api) of how you can use this, including multiple axios instances for different baseUrls"

"I had a drawing instructor recently say that Prismacolor has gone down in quality recently. I have had trouble sharpening them, even with a knife — the lead keeps breaking. I think it was Derwent that I've switched to.

Problem is that Prismacolor is the most commonly available coloured pencils and seem to come in many more colours than Derwent."
Great list
"It could definitely be more linear, the jump from level 2 to level 3 feels like jumping straight to 5. But, when you have an endgame car it really doesn't matter."
"> For example, republicans follow Milton's economics, while democrats Keynesian, both have correct predictions, both have wrong predictions, it should only then present both views equally. 

This is not quite right. For example, both [Greg Mankiw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Mankiw#2008.E2.80.932009_Keynesian_resurgence) and  [Jason Furman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Mankiw#2008.E2.80.932009_Keynesian_resurgence) are [New Keynesians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics#Major_New_Keynesian_economists)."
