I do have to say, though, that your comment includes some *massive* spoilers that will *completely* ruin this show for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, since it includes a non-obvious description of events that is revealed in the final 60 seconds of the last episode of the most recent season (and knowing about it upfront completely undercuts the drama!!). You may want to edit your comment to make your summary more vague.",best movies with a cool twist
59008,"My top 10 and this can change like the seasons lol

1. Burberry touch- One of my fav scents gotten alot of love.

2. prada llhomme/llhomme intense- llhomme was the scent that started my love affair with prada i couldn't decide between the o.g and the intense.

3. PDM oajan- My fav from the house more that herod and layton tho i love both.

4. MM by the fireplace- It was hard to pick between jazz club and BTF for me so this is one that might change depending on the mood.

5. Prada luna rossa carbon- My 2nd favorite blue scent and one of my dumb reaches it works perfectly for me.
6. Y EDP- My favorite blue already went through one bottle.

7. Creed green irish tweed- My first creed fragrance green and clean.

8. MB individual- I've went through 3 bottles of this already and i'm hurting that it's discontinued.

9. Stronger with you- My dumb reach in the winter it kinda reminds me of eros i wanna try out the intensly.

10. commodity tonka- It was a love at first sniff.

I went all in on the last KS, played it about 4 times, never even touched the expansion and then sold it on. The theme is what hooked me, but the game just wasn’t good enough to stay in my collection.",best board games
