52220,best hiphop album,Deltron 3030 is a pretty amazing classic that doesn’t get talked about. Black star with talon kweli and mos def is pretty definitive as well as the rest of mos defs discography. Dr. Octagon is a cool project too.
47608,best state to visit in the United States,"Big Sur was hit really hard by a wildfire that took almost three months to get under control last fall (the soberanes fire). It will recover, those biomes evolved to burn periodically, but it will take a few years to return to the beauty you remember as a child. So depending on when OP is doing the trip, it might not be the top choice in California."

70845,best movies with a cool twist,"Excellent show. I can't even comprehend how detailed of a diagram the writers had to draw for themselves just to be able to figure out how to tell a story like this.

I do have to say, though, that your comment includes some *massive* spoilers that will *completely* ruin this show for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, since it includes a non-obvious description of events that is revealed in the final 60 seconds of the last episode of the most recent season (and knowing about it upfront completely undercuts the drama!!). You may want to edit your comment to make your summary more vague."
59008,best perfume,"My top 10 and this can change like the seasons lol

1. Burberry touch- One of my fav scents gotten alot of love.

2. prada llhomme/llhomme intense- llhomme was the scent that started my love affair with prada i couldn't decide between the o.g and the intense.

3. PDM oajan- My fav from the house more that herod and layton tho i love both.

4. MM by the fireplace- It was hard to pick between jazz club and BTF for me so this is one that might change depending on the mood.

5. Prada luna rossa carbon- My 2nd favorite blue scent and one of my dumb reaches it works perfectly for me.
6. Y EDP- My favorite blue already went through one bottle.

7. Creed green irish tweed- My first creed fragrance green and clean.

8. MB individual- I've went through 3 bottles of this already and i'm hurting that it's discontinued.

9. Stronger with you- My dumb reach in the winter it kinda reminds me of eros i wanna try out the intensly.

10. commodity tonka- It was a love at first sniff.

53497,best medicine for a cold,"No.

Weed will keep you sick, honestly.  I'm the last person to bash marijuana, but I'm talking from experience here.


Vick's Vapor Rub and some DayQuil/Nyquil will help.  Also, tea, soup, and powerade."

65088,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Wait are they no longer on pardall??
27027,best board games,"Dino Island was just average for me. Nothing amazing, nothing really awful, just sort of middle-of-the-road. It was fun enough, but the set-up and tear down was way too long for how light of a game it is.   

I went all in on the last KS, played it about 4 times, never even touched the expansion and then sold it on. The theme is what hooked me, but the game just wasn’t good enough to stay in my collection."
