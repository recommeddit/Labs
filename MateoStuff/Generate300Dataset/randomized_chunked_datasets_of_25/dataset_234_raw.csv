"If you like a Manhattan then the Vieux Carre is right in your wheel house:

.75 oz sweet vermouth

 Bar spoon Benedictine 
Two dashes peychaud's, two dashes angostura 

Stir and serve over ice in a rocks glass ..."
"Nah, it's singing, then guitar, then piano. But being able to play a little music isn't gonna get you the chicks. Oh no. You need to play pretty well, and then get out there and actually play.

But the number one way to get girls to talk to you with music would be to have a crowd looking at you. Girls fucking love it when some guy is important, and if there are 20 people watching you work, you're important to somebody.

So if you want my advice, learn how to play in front of a crowd."
"I think that the corruption is so thoroughly entrenched in our political system that one person, or even a few good people can make any meaningful difference.  The only way to accomplish something worthwhile seems to be to make promises that ultimately compromise your principles.  Once you move down that path, compromise gets easier and easier until you are part of the problem.

However, I do believe that there are fundamentally good politicians."

I’m still poor so I stayed there with points. They had a $250k watch for sale on display randomly in the hallway"
T-Mobile can kiss my ass.
This is pure comedy gold
"yeah but so does every other school from number 1 to 13. You can make some legit arguments for Hopkins to be higher, but it shouldn't be a contest of endowments at that level."
"Oh yeah, that’s a great documentary. I’ll say Michael Moore’s films are a bit biased, but I find his documentaries so interesting that I’m able to look past that flaw."
Get the Metal Gear Solid trilogy. Just do it.

"As for as service quality, Verizon. Bang for your buck, T-Mobile. In between the two I’d say is ATT. It’s nearly as good as Verizon service, nearly as affordable T-Mobile. Sprint is the cheapest of the four, but their service is crap imo. 
Then they’re a bunch of smaller ones like metro pcs, etc, that I don’t really know about."
"Awesome. I use Sci-hub frequently, but I didn't know they had a Chrome extension. Also didn't know about Libgen. Good way to start my day, thanks!"
Thank you!

I'm taking the majority of my classes online this semester. I also took an online class over the summer. It absolutely depends on how the class is set up and the professor along with software that they may incorporate.
Gotta go with Drenched In Blood. Godzilla gets me also.

"Damn I'm late to the party! Let me just start by saying this is amazing work. I would really love to read your work if you have published this anywhere. I'd also love to see this website go live. Here're my two cents to make your work even better.

> At this point the algorithm only takes into account win/draw/loss and I would like to include margins in the future. 

There is a [summary paper](http://mathstore.ac.uk/headocs/8311_duckworth_f_duckworthlewis.pdf) by Duckworth (yes, that one) where he says that D/L is a much better way of assessing victory margins compared to the currently used methods, namely NRR.

> For instance, they still prefer to stick with ‘net run rate’ as a second criterion for splitting sides in leagues or min-leagues, despite the D/L based alternatives that are available.

I have read it in one of their previous papers but can't currently place it. You should definitely dig around there if you want to include margins. I'll PM you if I find it.

Also let me know if you need any help with collecting data. I have an ever-growing collection of cricket data and can help you set up jobs that can download data from cricinfo.

I also have an algorithm in mind for creating more fair player rankings, which I expect you'd want to include at some point. So let me know if you want to team up on it..."
"Seriously, I almost typed Northern California, but St. the last second specified Bay Area. Should have gone with my gut.

I've lived out there. Maybe Sacramento Valley is different, but most people on this sub probably think you're rolling in it at $72k a year. 

But NorCal people know the struggle of $4.50/gal gas and milk."
"The Pegasus Turbo 2 is generally thought to be their higher end durable trainer option when paired with the Vaporfly for racing. Where the Vaporfly has the carbon plate to stabilize the ZoomX foam and less durability, the Turbo 2 has a layer of firmer React foam for that."
