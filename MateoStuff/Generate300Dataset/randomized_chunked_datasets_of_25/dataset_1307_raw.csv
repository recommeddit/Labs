"Depends. I like Lowes better... Store seems better laid out, more selection, better customer service. Plus they will deliver for free clarge items like a chest freezer, whereas HD won't. Many times Lowe's beats in price too.

The HD is an hour away but the Lowe's is two hours away. Maybe it's a regional thing. The Lowe's does also have a HD a few miles away as well, so they need to compete I'm sure."
~~Install the insiders edition along with the standard edition. You can open both side by side~~.
Just a few minutes more!!! Damn...
"That’s okay. We’re all here to learn-

One of the things that irks me from this sub is the gate keeping. You can be a fan and not be up to date on the latest releases!"
"Hard to beat Dave Ramsey's advice. 

Plus EveryDollar is free."
She's amazing with a deadly sense of humour!
"Bosch seasons 1 - 5 are some of the best TV - EVER!! S6 is, unfortunately, surprisingly dull. Regardless, you can't lose with Bosch!"
Does this fit well with the EZ ones?
My sister managed to avoid finding out that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. She had to read it for class this past month. This was entertaining for everyone else in the house.
Joe's food is overrated and in my opinion gross; they do have some stiff drinks though!
"Use mediation and stop using Admob. I've written about MoPub mediation in one of my post so you can check it out and see for yourself. I'd say use Facebook audience network because they have pretty good support to help with your issues. And it's actual humans that reply. I've been using FAN from one year and I haven't seen any issues with it till now, and I'm not the top earner too."
"Good point. I initially hadn't considered it since Dark Soul's came out later in the franchise it and is available for PC, but I think Demon Souls is also deserving of a place and is popular enough to be put on the list."
"All of them

"Ah I got you, sorry, I read more into the take over the world line. I loved him for the first 2/3s and then the last minute. He's still one of the better villains, but he could have been probably second to Thanos if they had done the third act better."
Candy Corn of course.
"I think we have a winner! Free, very clean interface, easy to rotate, and several features that seem directly inspired by Desmos. I wish it were possible to zoom inidividual axes rather than the entire space, like Desmos, but nothing’s perfect."
"Most require clicking the link multiple times with popups each time before the file gets downloaded, which is why I stick with torrents"
"Although I don't condone the way you allowed the kids in your house to play with your dog (please never allow kids to sit on a dog, it's terrible for the dog and an accident waiting to happen), I agree that Goldens are excellent with kids. With any dog though, a lot of that comes from socialization and training as well.

My dog has loved kids since the day we brought him home at 8 weeks old. Even as a young puppy, he confidently approached kids of all ages, sizes, and genders and showered them in kisses. When we take him out for dinner and to local dog friendly places, we bring treats with us and allow the kids to give him some (to further reinforce that kids are a good thing), and he takes treats so incredibly gently from them (again though, this is thanks to a lot of training). When we first started this, we tried to keep treats just to older, more mature kids, and when we did start to allow toddlers and babies to give him treats, we'd ask them to throw the treat to him (as a safety precaution until he learned how to take treats more gently). Now he will gently accept a treat out of any child's hand."
Sorry I don’t dig the whole “Parker is a Stark dickrider” spiel with Tom. Tobey’s still my favorite and always will be.

Which extension on chrome web store is the legit one
"they are very legit. They are what's called ""gray market"" for watches, and I assume this applies to other products.  
  
Gray market is where you buy wholesale from brands/retailers and sell them for cheaper. If you buy gray market, you get a 100% real product, but without the manufacturer warranty. You get Jomashop's warranty. So if I buy a Rolex from Jomashop, I'll get a real rolex, but without the rolex 2-year warranty. If anything goes wrong and I want it to be covered by warranty, I have to send it to Jomashop. If I take it to Rolex they'll charge me out the ass as I don't have their warranty."

"I'm glad to hear you like it.  I made this list because I couldn't find any lists that felt to me like a good representation of the ""anime canon"".

However, there are some other good lists.  You might be interested in the [Animetacritic list](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) and the [RYM Forum's list](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/)."
