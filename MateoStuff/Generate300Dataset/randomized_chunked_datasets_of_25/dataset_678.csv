68065,best science fiction novel,"I always feel like a crazy person when I start laughing out loud while reading a book... damn you Hitchhiker's why you so good.

I would also recommend 

**Old Man's War** by John Scalzi
A simpler yet wonderfully written novel with some unique ideas. Focuses more on the story and characters and doesn't go all in on the sci-fi tech like some do.

and 

**Fire Upon the Deep**by Vernor Vinge
Space opera with some big ideas, also has a fantastically unique point of view character of an alien species."

22039,best celebrity,"Dolly Parton, a really great hugger and genuinely sweet person. She walked into Tower Records SF while I was there putting up promotional stuff for Columbia Records, probably 1977. She grabbed me for a hug and was stoked we were exactly the same height (even though she was in heels!). She asked me some questions and it felt like it was authentic. Iâ€™ve met hundreds of celebrities, but she and Robin Williams were far and above the nicest."

25505,best cricket teams of all time,"You cant win a game if your bowlers arent taking 20 wickets, doesnt matter how good your batsmen. Kohli currently has one of the best Indian bowling units of all time and currently the best batting line up in Asian conditions, really isnt that surprising to see him up there. 

I dont really think it would matter who was captaining this Indian team to be honest."

Michael Jordan and the Bulls were 1 game away from a three-peat championship.  When my mom finally came out of the Lingerie store I said to him, Well this is ""The End of the Road"" and I walked away. I wonder if he remembers that."

57644,best cologne,"In general I like the scents from Penhaligon. Sartorial and Endymion are the only two that wow'd me enough to make the purchases. I think their line may be getting a little too saturated with the Portrait line.

On a side note after a lengthy discussion with a Penhaligon rep there is actually a narrative that goes along with the Portrait line and how all the ""characters"" relate and interact with one another."
