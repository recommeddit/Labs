30808,best country to live in,"If you do move to Denmark I encourage you to stay firm on speaking Danish. Danish people are very quick to help foreigners out if they don't speak the local language (seeing as they all speak fluent english), but as soon as you're not a ""fresh"" foreigner anymore you will find them subtly offenced that you don't speak the local tounge. Also danish is a beautiful, bendy language that you can manouver in so many ways it's amazing. If you want to read truly beautiful danish litterature I recommend H.C. Andersen. (He wrote The Ugly Duckling, Princess on the Pea ect.)
