56968,"For a long time I was a big fan of Sink. It has an easy-to-use spout and it's always right next to a glass, so I think that's my most commonly used brand. It also pairs really well with Ice. 

In terms of sheer refreshment I have to recommend Hose. I have fond memories of grabbing a quick drink after running outside all day, and while Sink isn't ever too far away, Hose just provides a full force of refreshing, thirst-quenching goodness. 

For my ""don't recommend"" list, I have to mention Toilet. Yes, the serving sizes are giant. Yes, you can easily share it with your friends. All those benefits are rendered useless when you learn how little the refillable containers get cleaned. I'd much rather keep going back to Sink or Hose than sitting at the Toilet for a while.",best water brand

($ajax.get('page').then(...) etc)  Then I started using fetch, because it was just there and I didn't need to include anything.  Then, one day, I wanted an upload progress bar.  My options were either to spend like another day figuring out how to add that to my class, or just include axios.  So, axios it is. At least on uploaders.",axios alternatives reddit
30552,"The issue of Americans in questionable territory was definitely an impetus for Mexicans attacking the soldiers lead by Zachary Taylor.  Polk, being quite the Machiavelli, positioned Taylor beyond the [Nueces River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War#Conflict_over_the_Nueces_Strip) intending to start an international conflict.  Polk also attempted to start an armed rebellion in California, enter John Fremont.  Also, Polk considered the Mexican refusal to treat with [John Slidell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Slidell#Merchant.2C_lawyer.2C_politician) (second paragraph) as provocation for military engagement.  

Abraham Lincoln was gained early fame in congress as ""Spotty Lincoln"" for introducing the [Spot Resolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions), which protested President Polk to prove that the spot American troops were attacked on was indeed on American soil, which would garner war.

47852,"I just finished my freshmen year at Tech. Neither maths I took allowed calculator (integral calculus and linear algebra), and physics 1 (classical) exams only allowed ones that COULD NOT STORE TEXT (to prevent cheating). So rather than buy a new one, I used my good old TI-32 from middle school. I believe there are better options.

I also used my TI-84 CE on homework and other calculations that I needed to do. (I worked faster with the 84, so I used that on physics homework.... and also on linear occasionally if I was desperate to finish quick)",best graphing calculator for vector calculus
