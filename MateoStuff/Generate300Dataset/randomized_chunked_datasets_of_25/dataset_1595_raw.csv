"I never heard of an air couch until two hours ago when the inflatable hot tub I bought on Craigslist came with a wrinkled flyer in the instruction manual for one.

And now I'm wondering what the hell is going on with the universe. This can't be a coincidence. Am I real? Is this part of the simulation?"
"Coming in here late, but I'm 99% sure the big sale (""Winter Clearance"" ðŸ¤”) is because they are kaput."
That sounds terrible. But I'll try anything once.
Lead holders are the stuff. I found [this](http://leadholder.com/assets/lh-draft/caran_dache/cd-fixpencil-77-blk.jpg) inside an old box and now I can't use anything else. The sharpener under the top button works great.
"I inherited one of these spatulas from a friend. It's absolutely fantastic. I wound up buying two more just because. In addition to cooking, it's also great for cleaning pans, and cutting lines of coke."
"As it should!!



Bruins all day!!"
Yeah I agree. I think itâ€™s better than most of the others up there.

"[Teltik](http://teltik.com/),  a T-Mobile business line reseller, is always consistently left out of these types of lists, in favor of more expensive, and less competitive offerings. You have to have an EIN or a screenshot of an Ebay/Shopify storefront/other proof of having a business to qualify, but once you do, it is an excellent service.

Unlimited talk, text, data, for $40/mo (plus $3.5 taxes and fees) makes it an excellent choice. Plus it's postpaid priority, you still get T-mobile Tuesdays, and excellent support. IMHO, it should have been mentioned in both ""Best Premium Unlimited Data Plans"" and potentially the ""Best Value Unlimited Data Plans"" categories as well."
Chicago deep dish really isn't what the natives eat. The thin is great.
"My wife got both her BSN and MSN online.  She had no problems getting a job as a Nurse, or a Nurse educator.   Go get 'em."
She has a new one coming out next week!  I think the title is To Have and to Hate.
"Kennedy Ryan is queen.( Barring second book in her hoops series) I have absolutely loved all her books.
Emotional , strong heroine with plot that makes you think more deeply about the world. No one writes like her. Kingmaker and Grip series are my favorite."
"Chrome Azzaro is my favorite scent.  I use it all seasons and all times of day.  It's not super strong, but it definitely does smell nice and attract people when you come in close contact."
I order an apple leather case but Iâ€™m returning for this one. I ordered on Thursday
"I use edge, its pretty good but it comes down to preference"
I read Biden-attachment and was like wtf is that
"Gum that contains xylitol can help to kill plaque bacteria, as well as increase saliva (which contains enamel rebuilding minerals) significantly more than plain gum.

Trident contains xylitol, but because xylitol is expensive, they only use like 5%, which doesn't do anything.

Buy 100% xylitol gum."

"Also, why do different toothpastes advertise to be good at different things (""whitening"", ""cavity protection"", ""gum protection"", etc.) when most/all of them seem to have the same active ingredient (Floride)?"
Can confirm: is Naboo. Am Gungan.
Yeah. I'm not going to teach myself.
"I got my master's degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois. I took mostly online courses because I registered for classes late and they were my only option.  This turned out to be advantageous because the classes were 2 hours instead of 3 like the on-campus classes. The online classes met on campus one day each semester to account for shorter class time. 

A lot if schools are offering online classes that are just as valid as if you attended on-campus. Makes it easy when you have a job in addition to school. 

In terms of finding a job with my degree: one month after I finished my degree, I found a high level job as Associate Director and Head of Reference at a library in the area I wanted to live. 

I'm so glad I got my degrees, even if I don't use them directly in my current career. I gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunities or encountered the scenarios to learn otherwise. 

Tldr: I got a masters and I'm quite glad that I did."
