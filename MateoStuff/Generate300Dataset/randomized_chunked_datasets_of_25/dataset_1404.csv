51860,best iphone case,No. Absolutely not.
24992,best spiderman actor,"This is where I'm at.  The first Spider-Man with Tobey was nearly flawless.  The weakest parts were probably, I dunno, Macy Grey's cameo and Green Goblin having to act with a big plastic trash can on his head.  It was a serious landmark in superhero movies, too - before that, we had X-Men 1, which was the OTHER kind of superhero movie.  Tobeyman 1 was big, loud, fun.  

Maybe I can't see the full value of the newest one because I've been through three reboots, 5 movies and quality is all over the place."
23241,best car racing video game,What are you talking about? Assetto Corsa is clearly my preference

37262,best amusement park,Kings Island is also far more popular in the northern part of the state than Holiday World. HW isn't even a blip in the northern third of the state. It's cedar point and Kings island by a mile.

9768,best dorm hall at UCSB,"As someone who lived in San Nic, Santa Cruz is definitely the best dorm. It got cleaned up and refurnished a few years ago, it is the closest to campus point and has a beautiful lawn."
15352,best tree for the garden,"You've been drinking, right? You sound like you're trunk."
33007,best energy drink,"Rockstar original is definitely the worst.
For me the best is between full throttle citrus and AMP. The citrus flavors do it for me."

5251,best home improvement store,"totally clarifies, my first thought when reading this was ""awww.... im a human search engine"""
72417,best keyboard switches,"When it comes to mech keyboards its always about what you'd prefer to type on all day and whether the noises bother you/others. Linear switches (e.g. Cherry MX Red) is a common option for people who play FPS games. But if you're more of a typist than a gamer, you might prefer something more tactile.

Personally, my favourite switches I've landed on are Sakurio switches, which are linear, low force and very quiet."
44805,best items under $100,"If you’re looking for a budget speaker highly recommend the Anker Soundcore. Paid around $50-60 CAD on Amazon. I’ve had my for over 5 years and it still works like magic. The battery life lasts MONTHS. I’m not kidding, I use it almost every day and had to charge it after 10 weeks. It’s a powerhouse and I absolutely love it."

15883,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have 2 pairs:

* The first are some light blue, oval wayfarers with grey/green polarized lenses (will post picture tomorrow) and I have to say, they're the best sunglasses I have ever owned/tried.
* The second ones are a pair of Persol tortoishell wayfarers with grey/green lenses as well. Can post pictures of them too, if anyone is interested.

Edit: Pictures of the oval wayfarers ([one](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/12/67/d6/1267d69e8a1e0b723410351929022ad0.jpg), [two](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/a8/da/91/a8da91f19964e9f7a1a3c270a432ff68.jpg))."
71636,best movies with a cool twist,Brazil
42246,movies like Inception,"Surprised people haven't mentioned Adaptation - - it's a movie about a screenwriter adapting a novel into a script that you realize is the movie you're watching. Nicholas Cage doing an amazing job playing the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, and his twin brother, Donald. 

Also Synechdote, also written (and directed) by Kaufman. Really, really more mind-warping than anything else here, though ultimately it may be a little *too* weird (just saying). Seriously, though, put your phone down when watching either of these movies - - they require attention."
70250,best major to study in college,"I'd agree with this, I have friends that went to good schools for Engineering and they all had jobs right out of college lined up whereas the people I know with CS jobs didn't go to/finish college and just worked on their portfolios to the point where their work speaks for itself."
