24992,"This is where I'm at.  The first Spider-Man with Tobey was nearly flawless.  The weakest parts were probably, I dunno, Macy Grey's cameo and Green Goblin having to act with a big plastic trash can on his head.  It was a serious landmark in superhero movies, too - before that, we had X-Men 1, which was the OTHER kind of superhero movie.  Tobeyman 1 was big, loud, fun.  

Maybe I can't see the full value of the newest one because I've been through three reboots, 5 movies and quality is all over the place.",best spiderman actor

72417,"When it comes to mech keyboards its always about what you'd prefer to type on all day and whether the noises bother you/others. Linear switches (e.g. Cherry MX Red) is a common option for people who play FPS games. But if you're more of a typist than a gamer, you might prefer something more tactile.

Personally, my favourite switches I've landed on are Sakurio switches, which are linear, low force and very quiet.",best keyboard switches

Also Synechdote, also written (and directed) by Kaufman. Really, really more mind-warping than anything else here, though ultimately it may be a little *too* weird (just saying). Seriously, though, put your phone down when watching either of these movies - - they require attention.",movies like Inception
