56701,best desktop monitor,"Well, I mean that's the way you *don't* get downvoted when doing that so I guess so?"
2997,best webcamera,"While you're right that it is a bit of a solved problem in the $500+ price bracket, there really should be dramatically better options around the $200 price bracket and built into laptops than what we've been seeing.

A 1"" sensor with a decent readout speed and some relatively fast glass that isn't focus locked to infinity (can't believe webcam manufacturers ***still*** don't understand that people generally sit within a few metres of their webcams) isn't *that* much more expensive than a 1/5"" sensor, without even getting into the software issues that most of them have."
11125,best backpack for college,"I highly recommend [Chrome Bags](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/).

They make super durable 1000D Cordura (the toughest nylon woven) and has a heavy truck tarp liner suspended independently from the outer shell for additional durability and waterproofing. You can get caught in a heavy downpour and everything inside will stay bone dry in a Chrome bag. All the serious wear points like the straps, etc, are double-stitched so you don't have to worry about anything tearing out.

I've been carrying [mine](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/messenger-bags/metropolis-buckle-bag---large.html) for three years now and it still looks and works great with no sign of wear. There are messengers riding around the city here with bags that are 10+ years old in excellent condition. For your needs, I might suggest considering a pack like the [Pawn](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs/pawn-rolltop-pack---medium.html), which is big, but not too big, has convenient external pockets, and is made in the USA.

E: I'd also recommend picking up a simple neoprene sleeve to add some padding protection to your MacBook.

For around $150 you get top-shelf design, high durability, heavy weather resistance, and a fantastic warranty. 

These are serious bags made to last."
9860,best portable charger,"Hands down the best camping, long-term portable charger I've owned.  I purchased this charger for LIB 3 years ago & have taken it on every road trip and camping music festival since!  Fully charge it before your trip. It keeps our phones at full charge for the whole event! (4-6 days).  I'm sure this is contingent on how many people you share it with and how often you need a full charge (we did about 2 a day with 3 people).

17366,best iOS game,Ravensword: Shadowlands is pretty good
59848,best perfume,"Everything and Nothing by Tokyo Milk Dark 
See by Chloe
Be Delicious by DKNY"
1364,best ice cream flavor,I always thought that vanilla was boring and plain . . . but that's because I had only ever known cheap ice cream. Even spending the extra little bit and getting Haagen Dazs over the bulk stuff is a fair step up in terms of quality.
33829,best Pokemon game,"Plus, let’s not forget how the Black/White games singlehandedly have one of, if not the very best soundtracks of the entire franchise"
18098,best Kardashian,Someone I know produced cocktails with Khloe and he had a similar complaint - she wasn’t the best person to work with.
43018,best detective show,"Hunters on Amazon Prime!!!!! Al
Pacino plays a badass nazi hunter with a ragtag group of vigilantes seeking revenge on the Holocaust. so fucking badass"
54985,best water filter,"One would need a higher quality filter to begin removing chemicals and such.

My personal water filter is a [Multipure](http://www.multipure.com/) filter that removes much.  Chlorine etc.  Not floride as that's a much more expensive filter they sell."
53648,best medicine for a cold,This is great information. Thank you! Learned something new about cough suppressants and the cough reflex. Really interesting
38691,best newspapers to read,The I is pretty good. I will also read the Private Eye and The Economist...
8054,best laptop for general use,"From my experience with 4 different laptops of different price ranges: avoid Asus' laptops at all costs: in one of them the screen hinges broke after 3 or 4 years, and again after changing them; another had BSODs out of the box and some years later the battery exploded; another one died with no reasons after a year and another one has fan grinding problems since it was new and after replacing the fans the problem came back after a month or two."
39136,best web browser,Opera GX has a RAM and CPU limiter feature afaik. Maybe that could be interesting to you.
19487,best YouTube video,“Say it with me now: Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad”
56730,best desktop monitor,Don't fret too much. It seems like it was around $99 just a few weeks ago too. The deal may come back again in the near future. :) You can set up deal alerts for that.
62808,Best Data Science textbook,">Thanks! I went with the Oreilly book as it's geared more towards data science. Im not going to be 100% reliant on the book, and know I'll be consulting other resources to help myself along as well.

Sorry for the late response, but yes I think financial math would be useful. A majority of jobs in data science are related to the finance, marketing and insurance industries. As a result, understanding financial mathematics could be very useful in the future. 

Simply put, financial math deals with the metrics that are important to the running of a business. As a data scientist, we seek to understand and predict metrics. Understanding financial mathematics will allow you to work with those metrics much better, since you will have a firmer grasp of their nuances."
