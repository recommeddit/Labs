Gotcha. Well this is r/chrome so I just wanted to warn OP.
"I've only been to one all inclusive resort and coincidentally it was for an october honeymoon. We went to the Sandals St. Lucia Regency (I think that was the name of it, it's the biggest of the three on St. Lucia). We had an incredible time there. From the second we got there till we left, we really felt like a welcomed guest. It's really cool that you can leave your wallet locked in your room for a week and never think twice about it. Beautiful grounds, great staff, delicious food, great activities to do. Even the spa where we got a couples massage was fantastic. Like I said, my experience is very limited but if you're looking for recommendations, we loved it. Another cool thing was that you had full access to all three resorts on the island. Just hop on the shuttle, and when you get there everything is available to you. No check in process or anything. Just step off the shuttle and pony up to the bar. Pretty neat. Anyways, that's my two cents. Congratulations OP and I hope you have a great time wherever you end up."

"I go on Trip Advisor and look at the photos and reviews on there. A lot of places looked nice in the photos the resort had up and had great reviews.. but once I got on Trip Advisor and saw photos actual guests had taken, it was so different. Its the first place I go to check out resorts now :)"
"Thunar, because I am on xfce. Btw, I use Void :)"
Maybe I just had high hopes after the strong start. Watch and report back!
"Personally, I'd probably say the big Tootsie Rolls"
"This is a great challenge. Top 5? Damn.

* Dune \- Frank Herbert. A master class in intrigue, action, and world building. Plus, sand worm riding.
* Neuromancer \- Gibson. Still the most compelling near\-future dystopian setting. Set the bar for hacking and cyberpunk aesthetics.
* Rendezvous with Rama \- Arthur C. Clarke. Grand vision, still the most compelling first contact, sense\-of\-wonder setting.
* Lord of Light \- Zelazny. Yeah, it's sci\-fi through and though.
* When the dream dies \- A. Bertram Chandler. No objective value, but my first contact with large scale sci\-fi, after Asimov. Great adventure stories.

I have to say, at some point I just went for the books I remember most fondly, because the list here is long. I'd probably have trouble sorting through my top 50, let alone 5..."

That's silly.
Straight up I'm into the 6th season of gilmore girls and I'm a 33 yr old male. Never realized how well that show was written. It reminds me of Aaron Sorkin and Joss Whedon type writing.
"I recently stayed at Capella Pedregal in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It was absolutely amazing down to every last detail. The service there is top notch, great food on site at the resort, one of the top rated spas, salt water pools on the balcony of each room, just a 5 minute walk into town. I can't wait to go back, I highly recommend it. Came across it on TripAdvisor.com."
"Australia by a mile. Bradman is a cheat code himself, and with Gilchrist providing an extra boost at the wicketkeeper batsman I don't see any other team coming close. 

For the all rounder spot, I would pick Keith Miller (bat avg 37, bowling avg 23), or Steve Waugh(over 10k test runs at 50+ average) if you want to make the strongest batting lineup. Waugh can do the 5th bowler job easily when you have 4 great frontline bowlers. If you want to go with 5 proper bowlers, choose Keith."

"Are you just living out of one suitcase, or do you try and make the hotel a bit more homely?

How long do you think you will be doing this job for?"
"Here are mine - 

* *Foundation* by Asimov - the original trilogy
* *Dune* by Herbert - the first novel
* *2010* by Arthur C Clarke - Chapter 51 is one of my favorite passages in all literature.
* *Seeker* by Jack Mcdevitt - love the twist at the end
* *The Forge of God* by Greg Bear

Close to this list - the first 2 Motie books, Forever War, The Hercules Text, Timeline."
