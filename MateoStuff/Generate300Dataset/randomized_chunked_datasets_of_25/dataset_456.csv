31505,best hotel to live in,"It’s a PITA getting there. We’re in Australia, so we flew directly to Sri Lanka, had an airport sleepover (slept there for 8 hours) which I HIGHLY recommend. We flew to Male. Took a three hour sea plane AND a 45 minute boat transfer. So yes, it’s an absolute hike. You could of course pick a resort closer to Male and reduce that a bit.
