22495,"When I was in high school, Michael Keaton offered me a ride on the rural Montana road my dad lived on. I'm talking, town of 300 people. It had started raining and he pulled over in his nondescript Jeep. I was almost at my dad's house, I said no thanks (also, total stranger). It wasn't after he drove off that I realized who he was. This was at the height of his Batman fame. 

I told my dad when I got back to his house. His response: ""Sure! Was he driving the batmobile?"" Totally didn't believe me. A few hours later, he gets a call that MK was in town that day looking at property.",best celebrity

Edit: the use cases that are difficult or unsupported with fetch are perfectly valid, I didn't mean that they weren't. Just a silly choice of words. My point was only that you don't need a library for simple stuff like just downloading a file.",axios alternatives reddit

58870,"My long-winded top 10!

 1. Twilly d‚ÄôHermes - creamy ginger tuberose. It‚Äôs like putting on my favourite cashmere sweater. Both comforting and stylish. 

2. Terre d‚ÄôHermes EdT - originally bought it for my husband, but I wear it more than he does, especially when it‚Äôs hot and I crave the refreshing citrus woody punch

3. Tardes Carner Barcelona - a slight plasticy vibe at first spray, but dries down into an almond, heliotrope powdery dream

4. J‚Äôadore Dior - my first fragrance love and associated with so many great memories. It‚Äôs a bit too fruity for me to wear every day, but when I put this on for a date I feel very womanly and feminine. Also my husbands favourite. 

5. Eau des Merveilles Herm√®s - this one makes me feel like I‚Äôm eating oranges in a pine forest at the edge of the sea. Very laid back cool girl vibes. 

6. Champaca Ormonde Jayne - notes of rice and tea and flowers. When I wear this I can‚Äôt stop smelling myself. I can‚Äôt wait to wear this to a garden party or something. 

7. Chypre 21 Heeley - probably not a favourite for long as I am on a quest for the perfect Chypre. This one does a lot of things right - very mossy with a lovely floral edge. The longevity is really bad. 

8. Chlo√© EdP - another early love that I can‚Äôt quit. This one is so light and clean and feminine. I feel like it‚Äôs too young for me, but sometimes I crave it‚Äôs simplicity. 

9. Fragonard Eclat - bought this in Paris because I mistook it for another perfume I liked (Belle de Nuit - the knock off of J‚Äôadore) but ended up loving the sweet marshmallow anise dry down. The scent is discontinued, so I use it sparingly in the winter. Better than any other gourmand I‚Äôve tried. 

10. Joe Malone wood sage and sea salt - this one makes me so frustrated. I adore the scent so much and I love wearing it. But the price! If they could make this in a version that lasted all day I‚Äôd be hooked for life.",best perfume
27189,"If you dive any deeper into the hobby than Catan you'll find games that do the things you like in Catan, but much better than Catan. It's a great gateway game, to the point where it has honestly replaced Monopoly as being the ubiquitous ""everybody has that game in their closet"" game (which I'm glad about, I actually enjoy Catan as opposed to Monopoly), and it's got great things going for it. But it doesn't belong on a list of the ""top 100 games ever"" from hobby enthusiasts.",best board games
