29810,best money managing app,"They have a great tool, but they've started to become a lot more annoying in the past few months.

About every two months, there will be a new ""Personal Advisor"" assigned to me, who will then call me and try to sell me on their financial services.  I try to be polite, but they've been getting more pushy lately."
37696,best Marvel movie,this is the correct answer.
22629,best celebrity,"Working at a studio in Ireland Tom Cruise came by to promote his latest movie and was the direct opposite of what I expected. I honestly expected a bat shit crazy Scientologist asshole who thought he was above us all to enter the room. He came in, walked past the host of the show and shook hands with every single one of the crew in the room first. Asked us all how we were doing and I actually think he genuinely cared about the answers. He asked us questions about Dublin, laughed with us and then when he was finished introduced himself by name to the host and pre recorded his interview. After the interview he did the whole thing again in reverse. 

Been in this business over ten years and he was the single most genuine person I have met.

Macy Grey was a complete asshole by the way and for some reason I thought she'd be lovely."
57577,best cologne,How did you find it at Costco?  Was it a sale or special mark down only in your area?
6457,best Netflix documentary,You meant Colombia right?
1194,best ice cream flavor,OREO!
66661,best soccer team in the world,I don't really wanna be a front runner tho. I'm not a bandwagon fan.
4176,best text editor,"I understand the aversion to paying for stuff “that you can do for free”. But nothing does for free what JetBrains IDEs do.

I don’t have too much experience with other C IDEs beyond doing basic vim setup, but I can compare the Java side and IntelliJ makes eclipse look like a child’s plaything.

Truly, with eclipse, I can fully understand why some people dump it and go back to the simple life. Eclipse likes to step on your toes and otherwise trip you up a lot.

JetBrains IDEs are more like a **context aware** HUD that you can choose to participate in or not. Context is something that is sorely lacking or outright non existent with other competitors."
34036,best Pokemon game,"Those are the big 2 differences, pokemon and story. My reasoning for USUM is because it's the most current game, it has the best ""support"" due to more active players. So if you continue to play their games post USUM you will be most up to date with game mechanics. The reason I say ORAS is even though it's a ""new game"" it is still a remake and besides the graphics update what they added core mechanics wise and post game makes it a blast. Plus both offer a TON of legendary pokemon to catch post game which is my favorite part lol."
7551,best laptop for general use,"Is LG any good right now? I've had very bad experience with their phones, so kinda hard to commit buying one of their laptops"
3346,best webcamera,"As an avid c270 user, you really don't need anything else for 720p streaming and decent room lighting. We have those fancy 100€+ Logitech cams at work and they're certainly better, but not 80€+ better."
5247,best home improvement store,/u/TheTim posted [this](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s86/sh/36dd511b-1c21-4328-968b-977ba6b2b85d/d0a02c42894b8e9882aeb70ce51a8c22)
56840,best desktop monitor,"You only have one choice, really. LG"
31365,best country to live in,"take the patriot act, throw in a million or two prisoners incarcerated for minor weed possession, add a dose of the national guard shutting down protests, ad stir."
3356,best webcamera,"It's worth factoring in that if the person later gets more serious about streaming, a second camera can be useful, so that cheaper webcam won't have been a waste. I'm not even a speedrunner but enjoyed using a controller cam, as it made the the stream feel a little more personal. I even got a third cam down the line for games with pedals."
69304,best major to study in college,"To elaborate on koala's post, so many disciplines are turning to computers, programming and computational work. 

I work with biologists, geneticists, agriculturalists, climatologists (and more) who do more and more of their day to day work, and research work, on computers and clusters that it'd make your head spin."
24223,best anime,Surprised and happy to see Bleach here in the lost.
65189,best phone service company,"T-Mobile is my favorite of the big 4 (3). 

We had em all and T-Mobile is the cheapest, and featured; ie never had a stupid error on my phone about “calling and web browsing at the same time is not supported” - sprint and Verizon 

Att was good but in some areas it’s not as good as other (obviously everyone is like this) and for the price it wasn’t worth it IMO 

T-Mobile also has free shit every week and year (I use mlbtv) 

And overall just a good experience"
6062,best Netflix documentary,"Yes I was going to mention this one. It is absolutely devastating but a compelling story nonetheless. No longer in Netflix, though, that I know."
28050,best breakfast foods,In it
59791,best perfume,I got a sample of this from Sephora and am seriously considering buying it! It smells amazing
41654,movies like Inception,Memento was pure magic. Saw it a few months ago.
55967,best action and adventure movie,"Came here to post this.

As much as the movie was overlong, it was genuinely refreshing to have a protagonist who was mostly enjoying himself and going from beautiful fantastic place to beautiful fantastic place."
38483,best newspapers to read,"I used to read the newspaper everyday when we got a subscription.

My question to my fellow redditors is, what is your technique on picking out what to read?
I sat down one day waiting for a friend and read the whole NY Times daily edition from first article to last (Minus the classifieds and court notices etc.) and it took a whole 3 hours! I don't know how people can actually read the entire newspaper of that caliber in one sitting. Granted some newspapers are smaller then others, but the NY Times is found everywhere in the 50 states."
14818,best romantic novel,Sugar Daddy by Lisa Kleypas.  I just adore this story.
