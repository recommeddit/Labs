About every two months, there will be a new ""Personal Advisor"" assigned to me, who will then call me and try to sell me on their financial services.  I try to be polite, but they've been getting more pushy lately.",best money managing app

22629,"Working at a studio in Ireland Tom Cruise came by to promote his latest movie and was the direct opposite of what I expected. I honestly expected a bat shit crazy Scientologist asshole who thought he was above us all to enter the room. He came in, walked past the host of the show and shook hands with every single one of the crew in the room first. Asked us all how we were doing and I actually think he genuinely cared about the answers. He asked us questions about Dublin, laughed with us and then when he was finished introduced himself by name to the host and pre recorded his interview. After the interview he did the whole thing again in reverse. 

Been in this business over ten years and he was the single most genuine person I have met.

Macy Grey was a complete asshole by the way and for some reason I thought she'd be lovely.",best celebrity

4176,"I understand the aversion to paying for stuff “that you can do for free”. But nothing does for free what JetBrains IDEs do.

I don’t have too much experience with other C IDEs beyond doing basic vim setup, but I can compare the Java side and IntelliJ makes eclipse look like a child’s plaything.

Truly, with eclipse, I can fully understand why some people dump it and go back to the simple life. Eclipse likes to step on your toes and otherwise trip you up a lot.

JetBrains IDEs are more like a **context aware** HUD that you can choose to participate in or not. Context is something that is sorely lacking or outright non existent with other competitors.",best text editor
34036,"Those are the big 2 differences, pokemon and story. My reasoning for USUM is because it's the most current game, it has the best ""support"" due to more active players. So if you continue to play their games post USUM you will be most up to date with game mechanics. The reason I say ORAS is even though it's a ""new game"" it is still a remake and besides the graphics update what they added core mechanics wise and post game makes it a blast. Plus both offer a TON of legendary pokemon to catch post game which is my favorite part lol.",best Pokemon game

I'm not even a speedrunner but enjoyed using a controller cam, as it made the the stream feel a little more personal. I even got a third cam down the line for games with pedals.",best webcamera

We had em all and T-Mobile is the cheapest, and featured; ie never had a stupid error on my phone about “calling and web browsing at the same time is not supported” - sprint and Verizon 

Att was good but in some areas it’s not as good as other (obviously everyone is like this) and for the price it wasn’t worth it IMO 

T-Mobile also has free shit every week and year (I use mlbtv)

My question to my fellow redditors is, what is your technique on picking out what to read?
I sat down one day waiting for a friend and read the whole NY Times daily edition from first article to last (Minus the classifieds and court notices etc.) and it took a whole 3 hours! I don't know how people can actually read the entire newspaper of that caliber in one sitting. Granted some newspapers are smaller then others, but the NY Times is found everywhere in the 50 states.",best newspapers to read
