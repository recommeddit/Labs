I would do research on what I want and who does it best to get the best product and then shop around to see where I can get the best deal. Leverage coupons, sales, memberships, all of it.

72731,"There are very few under 70 grams, and even fewer that are actually reasonable as purchases (which excludes Finalmouse's offerings). If you want it to be under 70g and can't get a Model O (or wait for the new Coolermaster MM710 to come out), you could get a G305, and have a honeycomb battery cover, shell, and mouse buttons printed by a 3D printing service. You could get to under 70 grams, and have wireless on top of that.

On top of that...you could just get any decently lightweight mouse and drill the fuck out of its shell (such as the G Pro Wireless or something) but...I wouldn't *personally* do that, because it permanently ruins the mouse.",best wireless lightweight mouse

7433,"I'm (USA) in the market for a gaming laptop. Won't you help?

I'll try and list everything I've researched:

* Price $1,200-$1,800 (would prefer best $/value/FPS).
* Weight doesn't matter.
* Likely plugged into a monitor half the time, so (I believe) mux switch is needed.
* Numpad preferred.
* Screen brightness/colors on the better side of ""okay"". No need for super accurate colors when off-monitor. Brightness is nice when not plugged into monitor but not a deal breaker.
* Graphics do NOT need to be ULTRA HIGH MEGA - I am perfectly happy with medium-high for most games. If the difference between high and ultra is $300, I'll go for high.
* That said, if I'm paying above $1.2k, I'd like a laptop that can hang for 5 years+ and still get decent frame rates.
* Max wattage is mandatory (well, I assume based on $/performance).
* Travel will be minimal, so plastic/cheaper case would be acceptable, though not exactly preferred.

For reference, my current desktop is an AMD FX-8350, GTX 1070, and DDR3 12gb RAM. I would hope for a noticeable improvement from a new laptop.

BIG ALSO: I can absolutely wait until Black Friday sales. I am in no rush.",best laptop for general use

22746,"Tom Hanks doesn't just seem like the nicest guy. I was a nanny for a Hollywood family, met hundreds of A-listers. Most of them were self-obsessed wankers, but Tom took the time to shake my hand and made sure he learned my name. He never forgot it. Also he would always say ""There's a snake in my boot!"" for the youngest of my charges, which obviously made him laugh hysterically.

EDIT: I could do do an AMA, although out of respect for the family I wouldn't be able to reveal who I worked for. Maybe I will sometime soon. Is there a way to get my AMA on the schedule so people can see it ahead of time? Or is that reserved for actual celebs? (I'm pretty new to Reddit).",best celebrity

12104,"I find buying a bottle of good stuff, and savouring it over a long while isn't actually that expensive over the long run, and also tends to lead to healthier drinking habits.

As a gift to myself on a special occasion I spent $50 on a pint sized bottle of imported whiskey.  I savoured it, and it lasted me a year.  In the meantime I went through a couple other bottles of various quality whiskeys, but when I felt like wanted/deserved something special, I had a single glass of the special whiskey.  I don't know that it was necessarily 'better' for being expensive, but it did make me slow down and enjoy it, and not just drink to get a buzz.

I think enjoying it this way really helped me pick out dis distinctive flavours between various whiskeys, and I don't think that it really that expensive in the long run for the enjoyment I got.",best gifts for dad

5944,"Keep in mind that you're still young and nobody has any idea of what the landscape will be 5 years from now. Nothing is guaranteed. Focus on what you enjoy because you're more inclined to deep dive into it and learn principles that may span across multiple languages at a time. Many languages share some common threads and they all tend to steal/borrow from one another. Learn that abstraction.

That said, Javascript looks like it's the most reliable choice. Even if you look past the current technological climate it has a stronghold in, the language itself evolves and adopts many concepts from other languages. From personal opinion and experience: I'd say Go (what I do at work and as a hobby) and Haskell (what I do as a hobby) have not only been very rewarding but keeps my interest peaked which fuels the push for more.",best programming language for web development
