"""...and on the sixteenth day Granny Smith created red delicious, and it was good. Then on the seventeenth day Granny Smith created Gala, and it was also good. On the eighteenth day Granny Smith slipped on a wet step and hurt her hip. She was feeling a little off so she created crab, which was pretty disappointing. She took the next five or six days off to recuperate then she made cortland, which was also good...""

"I thoroughly agree with OP’s point about Haider. Goddamn amazing. Since we’re on the topic of Vishal Bharadwaj, he really draws fantastic performances out of his actors and actresses. Saif in Omkara was magnificent, and Tabu in Haider and Maqbool was amazing."
"Wow this is quite comprehensive. So far I've had success with audiobook bay and converting them/opening into VLC which has switched over to the freeaudiobook app.

It sounds like I should stay away from the sites you just went over extensively...ugh"
"Its library contain something like
```
module.export = typeof window === “undefined” ? require(“node-fetch”) : window.fetch
```

What do you want to update there?)
All updates should be in “node-fetch”"
"It's amazing, but also *dark*. Very different from Lord of the Rings in that regard. When I'd finished it I actually went out of my way to read something *happy* soon after. But then I'm a humongous wussie."

"Black and white were awful, second version is way better. Despite being the worst region and story.

First games are hell in all honesty."
You’re going to love it!!!!
But zinc also has to be taken IMMEDIATELY (like within 24 hours) upon first symptoms in order to have any significant effect on cold duration and severity.
i thought the mentalist was pretty good but you have to be pretty observational like jane was.  There was none of this detective reveals some random inspiration or detail impossible for the audience to know.  Everything relevant detail jane was observing was shown to the audience
"I agree the one says ""Spending $1000+ on a phone, don’t cheap out on the case.""  I need a case with strong protection for I drop the iphone 13 a lot, case with built in screen protector, shockproof at least 2 meters!  https://lvmous.com/collections/iphone-13-waterproof-case"
"Hi, when it comes to single-core performance, the i7-1165G7 is quite a bit better, but realistically, it isn't going to make a big difference for general use. If you can work with a 13"" display and wait for it to drop back down to $999, it is a way better value because you get a stronger CPU, more RAM, and more storage."
"I'm an appliance tech, and i can echo some of the same sentiments: avoid Samsung, LG, Kenmore, GE and Frigidaire like the plague. JennAir, Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Amana, and Maytag is the way to go"

"Got Nord a few months back, was recommended to me as a good app for Android but I mostly use it on my desktop. I got my CC details leaked and now am extremely paranoid so I'm using an Internet kill switch, which means you can only access the Internet when using the VPN. I think it can be applied to torrenting as well"
No love for a City College of San Francisco subreddit? For shame.
My school never taught about it
Omg yes Duke of Shadows ugh I forgot!!
"I’m crazy about documentaries, I’ve watched pretty much all of them, and I have to say NONE has stuck with me as much as Dear Zachary. The storytelling is the most fucking raw shit I’ve ever experienced, talk about being taken on a ride. And I also have only been able to bring myself to watch it once. *that* moment that happens, dang.... I have never felt second hand anger so strongly"
">*The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass... when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you've just been discovered, you're all subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.*"

"While I agree with you in general, there are some pretty solid indicators for research scores that allow for a relatively unbiased view.

Although good for nothing else, this map shows how far the integration of non English speaking countries into the Anglo-Saxon academic world has come if only because these locations are included in this list.

The problem is that governing bodies of universities seem to make those rankings their top priorities.

Although academic competition is not necessarily a bad thing... I'm torn."
