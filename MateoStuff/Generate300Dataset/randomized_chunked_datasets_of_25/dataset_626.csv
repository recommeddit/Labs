12968,"It's definitely not cheap. But if you are willing to move with just the bare necessities (no furniture etc.) you can make it pretty reasonable.  If you want to start thinking long term strategy, I would recommend saving money while living with your parents for the purpose of moving to another state.

I was in a similar rut in my 20s and moved 750 miles for my first real job. Then I moved another 2k miles for a promotion. Now that I'm experienced I could go back where I'm from and have a much better chance at getting a job.  I would recommend looking at Texas if you don't have much experience. There are jobs everywhere in just about every field.",best gifts for mom
32504,"I've stayed at both riu cancun, and riu palace las Americas. Liked them both very much. I found that a $20 tip in the morning got you whole group treated like kings at the pool bar. I did it every day. No matter how packed they were, I barely waited. Everything was very clean. Food is pretty bland, IMO. Breakfast was best. The specialty restaurants were good for a better service experience, but still bland.

71490,"The end of the original ""Saw"" movie had me trembling when the ending happened... people that have seen it know what I'm talking about... people that haven't seen it I recommend it, it's a very mediocre, gory movie until about the last 3 minutes where it becomes one of the best movies I've ever seen.

SPOILER ALERT:
If you haven't seen it but still want to know how it ends [here's the ending](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v01gDZVRTf0) 
Explanation: The entire movie you are lead to believe that the guy in the black jacket that enters the room with the gun is controlling the two men in the room, one who cut his foot off and the one still shackled, as well as some random dead guy that has been laying on the floor in the middle of that room for the ENTIRE movie. Turns out, the guy who is still cuffed to the pipe kills the guy in the black jacket and the guy who is missing a foot crawls out of the room for the first time all movie to go get help... but then, the guy in the middle of the room stands up and walks out after the guy who just crawled out... turns out, the ""dead guy"" laying in the floor was running the whole operation and enjoyed his front row seat. The movie leads you to believe that he is completely insignificant cause the two men in the room have minimal interaction with him because he's ""dead"" right? Wrong. Just watch the video.",best movies with a cool twist
