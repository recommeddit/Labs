71835,"I always tell people who have never seen this movie that they need to watch it twice. Finish it the first time, and then immediately start it over and watch again. 

**[spoilers below, if you haven't seen it, and don't want me to ruin it, quit reading]**

The acting in this movie is incredible. It's a bunch of people who are good at acting playing nurses and doctors, who, by the fact that they are nurses and doctors, and don't know much about acting, are absolute shit at acting. Watch the movie a second time and it's so apparent, but you probably would have never noticed the first time, or, if you're more observant, maybe you did, and thought they were acting poorly. Perfect examples: When Leo and his partner are asked to turn in their guns, Leo takes the holster of his belt in one fluid motion. His partner has a ton of trouble removing it. Also, in the same scene, the police captain, who was played by one of the main doctors at the facility, basically coddles them when asking for their guns. He speaks down to them like a parent would a child. It's obvious he is not an officer, but actually a doctor with too many years of experience, and very little patience, dealing with mentally ill.

The movie is incredible.",best movies with a cool twist
