17608,best iOS game,"Enjoy man! Mafia is a chat game so don’t take it too seriously, some people can get worked up but it’s really chill if you don’t stress it. 

Great choice with Golf Blitz too! Don’t forget you can join a Team with your friends for some friend trolling! 

Ask if you’re confused about either game and I’m glad to help."
59646,best perfume,"You, sir, know what you like. There is a certain confidence about you, and in your heart, you may not be sure whether that confidence has been legitimately earned. You are one that likes to adventure, but those adventures must be planned. You are likely younger, perhaps early 30's, and probably live in a city that is not the biggest one in your home state. You live comfortably both economically and socially."

6786,best iPhone,"My first iPhone was the 4. That was a huge upgrade for me coming from Android. I’ve also owned an iPhone 6 but currently still using my 7+ which is coming up on 4 years.

My 7+ has been the best phone I’ve owned and I refused to upgrade because of Touch ID. I’m hoping that it comes back one day to the iPhone with an under screen fingerprint sensor."

71835,best movies with a cool twist,"I always tell people who have never seen this movie that they need to watch it twice. Finish it the first time, and then immediately start it over and watch again. 

**[spoilers below, if you haven't seen it, and don't want me to ruin it, quit reading]**

The acting in this movie is incredible. It's a bunch of people who are good at acting playing nurses and doctors, who, by the fact that they are nurses and doctors, and don't know much about acting, are absolute shit at acting. Watch the movie a second time and it's so apparent, but you probably would have never noticed the first time, or, if you're more observant, maybe you did, and thought they were acting poorly. Perfect examples: When Leo and his partner are asked to turn in their guns, Leo takes the holster of his belt in one fluid motion. His partner has a ton of trouble removing it. Also, in the same scene, the police captain, who was played by one of the main doctors at the facility, basically coddles them when asking for their guns. He speaks down to them like a parent would a child. It's obvious he is not an officer, but actually a doctor with too many years of experience, and very little patience, dealing with mentally ill.

The movie is incredible."

63863,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"If you're a new member, chat a bit in the global chat box and ask any questions you have there...you'd be surprised how many free points you get donated from other members just for being a polite member of the community :-). After a while of seeding lots of old members have more points than they would need and routinely 'gift' them to new members to help out.  Easy way to offset ratio costs."

28640,best breakfast foods,"Came here for this. I miss Turkish breakfast SO much. Every morning I'd down my body weight in delicious tea, have a couple of hard boiled eggs and all that standard breakfast fare you mentioned. I was particularly fond of the peynir and luckily found a store in Minneapolis that sells it! They sell  Tamek juice too, so I can have şeftali nektarı WHENEVER I WANT! It was my FAVORITE!

But honestly though. Let's talk about Turkish food in general AMIRITE?! Manti, lahmacun, bulgur, gooooooooooooooood I put on like ten pounds in eight weeks."
