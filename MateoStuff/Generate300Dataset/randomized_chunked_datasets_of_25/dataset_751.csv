41492,"Then think of what kind of music you like and pick the instrument that fits it. Maybe also consider how expensive the instrument is. 

Oh, one other that might be good - French horn. You can play anywhere but a jazz band, and it's the star instrument of movie soundtracks. Pretty difficult to play, though, there are a lot of partials for each fingering.

32135,"Wasn’t a hotel. My family rented a beach house for a week for Spring Breaks. They usually were a block from the Destin Florida beach and had a pool. Great memories.

One year we stayed at my Aunt and Uncle’s company rental  in Panama Beach (Uncle had a hand in a massive business on his side of the family, and let us stay at this humongous house on a country club. Oh yeah it had a dock and a small boat too)
They even let us use their private jet + crew! 

Otherwise there was a nice place in Nashville that had THE BEST shower and breakfast. It was great because my sisters, mom, and I had been out all night for New Year’s.",best hotel to live in

Taking into consideration importance to a position, Montana is more important than Brady to the sport, so Montana > Brady, but some might say player X is > Montana, and we have ourselves a debate but I'm okay with then having without regency bias.",best NFL player

I use a moto g power, bought about 6 months ago. $50 for Google Fi users, which I also recommend. The battery life is great and it does absolutely everything I want.  I would expand your horizons and see what's out there! iPhones are great but they're really not the only game in town anymore. Maybe they never were,  but I only woke up to how good the quality of other phones can be a couple years ago.",best iPhone
