"I found that it was too difficult to find the items I needed in a large freezer.  It was full for only a short period of time and then space was wasted.  I switched to a smaller one and intended to buy a second small freezer if I ran out of room.  My intention was to fill both freezers and then empty one and unplug it when they got half empty.  I never did run out of room with only one.  You just adjust your buying accordingly.  

If you have a large family and/or you are an organized person and can partitian off a larger freezer to simplify finding items than you may find a large freezer convenient but I found mine to be a pain."
"Infinity War is barely a movie, just cgi action scenes and quips for 2.5 hours. At least Endgame has some real emotion in it"
"Hahahaha so true. I haven't noticed that, but will definitely keep an eye out for it next rewatch.

Another thing that heard Catherine O'Hara explain (on radio interview) was that all of her wigs (bébés) are named after her family and friends! 

Hahahaha immortalizing her friends on tv via her wigs, *which she also sometimes wears as hats too*."
"I'm actually not a huge fan of One Million. I don't mind it, it's just not great in my opinion."
It’s almost as though these rankings are meaningless and arbitrary…
"Yep, I thought I had just seen one of the most original movies ever after it was over. Well done start to finish and it was low-budget, yet felt like a much greater effort."
"Seconding (or thirding or whatever) rats...I don't have any right now but I have had them in the past and they are AWESOME pets.

Plus, they're not as bitey (or at least mine weren't) as the hamsters I had as a kid. Hamsters can't see too well in bright light (they're nocturnal) and it makes them kinda bitey."
"Same, it’s been so fucking long since season 1"
"1: Magic Mountain. X2,Tatsu,and Full Throttle(X2 and Tatsu are insane, so many other amazing rides here).

2: Great America. Maxx Force, Vertical Velocity, and Goliath(My Home Park, so many good rides, V2 is really underrated, especially in the front row).

3: Over Texas. NTG, Mr. Freeze, Titan(Lots of charm here. I also really enjoy the Texas Skyscreamer).

4: St Louis. American Thunder,Mr. Freeze, and Boss(American Thunder is super underrated, one of my favorite wooden coasters, Mr. Freeze is really good also, everything is kinda eh).

5: Fiesta Texas. Superman and Iron Rattler. (Not impressed by anything else here, Iron Rattler was very disappointing(Went Before Wonder Woman))."
"University of Louisville online will do Degrees for $250/credit hour as an active duty discounted rate.  That is whether or not you use tuition assistance.  You won't find a better deal.

"This is my method, and it has never failed me.  I also quarantine myself, so that I don't get others sick.  

If I know who got me sick I may subtly imply that sick people should try to contain their illness. How people are able to hang out in common areas, coughing all over everything is just confusing.  When I'm sick I try not to leave my room, and I Lysol the fuck out of anything I touch in common areas."
"Unfortunately, I don't buy books from Amazon.  But I can't say that Litrpg has been my wheelhouse. 

I have read the Red Knight, and its was fine, but the tropey hooks about wayward princes just wasn't something I had interest in pursuing. 

Priest of Bones sounds interesting!

Thanks for the recommendations"
Wireless around that price for Fingertipp go with viper ultiante
"In regards to the cable, that's standard practice because those higher quality cables are expensive so no one sells them with the products.

For a better profit is better to choose a cable that will suffice for 90% of its users."
Alright where's the bastard reviewer who submitted a rotten on the very last day dropping Endgame from 95 to 94?.. Give me his address. Lol. :)
"Battery plant under contraction in Ohio, similar to gigafactory. Huge build outs in charging network also underway (2700 more with Evgo) plus electrify America is building a similar amount. It all looks like it will come online surprisingly quickly for GM. They may make some dumpy interiors but they seem very good at scaling up production."
"Also [Reddit check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-check/mllceaiaedaingchlgolnfiibippgkmj), I never see it being mentioned but is probably the best extension related to Reddit after RES. You watching a link from somewhere else? find any post on Reddit where that link was posted. Pretty useful to see discussions on reddit about anything you consume."
And it can be combined with uMatrix for even more control.  The configuration of that is not for the faint of heart though.
"Smoke weed erryday. Seriously, I haven't been sick in two years."
I really like dirt 5. Straight up fun arcade type racing. The environmental effects are insane.
Which case is the one with the orange power button?
NERF guns and alcohol.
"Edit. 

Lol 

Game ass?"
"Jeeeeez thank you. Try this tequila. It will change your life. 

“Fortaleza Blanco” Be sure to get it chilled. Hands down best tequila I have tried thus far."
"Technically, yes, I manage my own time but it is dictated by the task(s) at hand.  Some days it is more efficient to stay in and do paperwork, some days I work at the site until midnight, sometimes I have a scheduled meeting with a client or contractor, etc.  That's kind of a perk, I usually work long hours but for the most part they are how and when I chose to manage them."
