"I agree. I've also taken several [Udemy.com](https://Udemy.com) courses (not on React) and found many to be excellent. I took Wes Bos' React course and I'm now working through his React + Redux.

I send the phone back and got a different 6s. It was working perfectly and then Apple got that 30‚Ç¨ battery replacement. So we did that replacement at an official Apple store, and while getting home the phone didn‚Äôt charge... battery completely dead. Imagine an official Apple store broke my phone. The next day my father went to another Apple store and they checked the phone and said; yes it‚Äôs completely dead. So they handed over a completely new 6s. After 1 year the phone started to age. Because the 6s is just an old device. And in January 2020 I got an brand new iPhone XR and I‚Äôm very happy with it! Conclusion: I‚Äôm
Never playing games on my phone anymore. Sorry if this is a little bit too long ü§£"
Or.... You make it a tradition and give her a box of candy each year! Just because she once got it doesn't mean she suddenly doesn't like them anymore....

Hello!  Why is the Lenovo Thinkpad in 14‚Äù more expensive than the 15‚Äù ? Thank you so much for this list!
It's more like sheets handles images at all. You can store images in cells and recall them via a formula in another cell. Hard to do that in Excel without vba or some sort of camera trick.
"Asking for an opinion for home stuff at a big box home improvement store is like asking for an opinion about a top of the line television at Walmart. 

The associates are largely clueless about their products and applications. This isn‚Äôt a fault of the associates, rather the company that employs them. You can‚Äôt expect expert advice from employees that are earning shit wages."
"FYI, you can become a patron for a month for $5, download everything they've done so far, then opt out and listen to it all in your own time. That's currently 23 commentaries for the MCU, 8 for Star Wars and one for Toy Story (if you do it next month, you get all four Toy Story commentaries as well). Plus all the bonus episodes, of course."

I know nothing of the actual recipes besides the basic ingredients (essentially the flavor) of the ice creams and the allergen info. The least ordered items are probably the sherbet freezes. They're basically melty otter pops in a cup.

"Although there are many journal publishers that are for profit, there are still quite a few that are non-profit. I work for a single-title journal publisher and any profit we make at the end of the year is funneled back into the journal to make it better for both readers and authors. Just wanted to point out that not all journal publishers care just about profit :)"
