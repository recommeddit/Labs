Indeed isn't social media at all, and just flipping the ol' privacy switch to ""Public"" seems to start the calls and emails flowing in.",best social networking site for CS

33275,"Yeah I looked into the Rivian. Too expensive and it’s a startup without a track record of reliability or ability to build enough in sustained numbers. I’m a fan, but not ready to trust them yet. 

If the ID4 was significantly cheaper I would consider it, but it starts at the same price as the Lightning without the towing package and has less range, doesn’t have some of the features of the Lightning like exterior plugs. So at that point I might as well go with a Ford. At this point I’d pay more and end up with something less capable.",best electric car

33756,"I live in southern Ontario, right across the border from Detroit. Friends, family and the cottage are north and north east of Toronto, roughly 700km away. There also aren't that many ev chargers the further north you go.

Do I like them? Yeah they're pretty cool.
Are the feasible in my situation? Not really.

If anything I'd need a second vehicle for longer trips up north, or even a hybrid over a full ev.

My dad came by with a rental Ford fusion Hybrid the other day. It was pretty slick and with an electric range of 80km would be perfect for the daily commute/ puttsing around town, and when it switches to gas would be best for the road trips. One day when charging/range is better, or I can afford the luxury of a second car, I'd go full ev. Until then, it wouldn't work.",best electric car
