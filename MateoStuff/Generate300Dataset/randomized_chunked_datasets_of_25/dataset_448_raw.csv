Splendor has been kicking ass as my new gateway game.  Every time I put it on the table a new person joins the fold.  My friends got new boardgames for Christmas this year because of Splendor.
"Almost anything by Andrew WK.

I know he isn't your genre, but his music is the perfect beat to run to, and his songs are so uplifting and happy that I just can't help enjoy my workout.

"A few of our players are undervalued I feel. Particularly Paredes, Lo Celso, Molina and A. Correa"
But only if you want to watch something 4 times in a row and still not be entirely sure about what happened.

"I find Lowes to be cleaner, brighter, less crowded, and more employees to get help with stuff vs Home Depot which is dark, dingy, dusty, crowded, and every employee is busy so it's hard to get help. Home Depot does have cheaper prices and a way better tool selection, but Lowes seems to have nicer items. Both are within a 3-5 minute drive for me so I pretty much choose what I want from both. I prefer Lowes, but when I need a tool now then it's off to Home Depot. I've used the HD rental tool a couple times as well. Also, I've been harassed by those stupid solicitors at Home Depot (no I don't need my water tested, been drinking the same unfiltered twp water for over three decades).

Overall it's Lowes for me, but HD wins in tools."

"Did you tip in cash, or on a card? Do they *get* all their tip on a CC? I also have spent a while in wait service, and I know cash is always better, and I also have heard that some all inclusive places take a significant portion or all of a servers tip if it isn't in cash."

Legoland is just the fucking worst. It’s galling that they have the wherewithal to charge almost Disney prices for their sad selection of rides and dirty old LEGO structures that are sun bleached and peeling.
Well look at you Mr. Lovesyerdad.
oh my god this is amazing. The commentary is fantastic.
I remember cracking up laughing at this at my middle school lunch table. Brought back memories lol

"Thanks for the advice! So far it works better than the other solutions I've tried -- for example the eraser works! (I'm not sure yet how well the import PDF works, I had to ""insert printout"", but it seemed to get the job done)"
