24572,"My list might seem casual to some, maybe even controversial, but hey, whatever.

1. **[Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) -** It may not have been my first anime, but it was certainly the one that left the biggest impact on me. I fell in love with its worlds, the characters, the story, everything about it appealed to me, and it helped me get out of a pretty low period of my life, and because of that will likely always be my favorite as a result.

2. **[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) -** To this day there hasn't been a show that made me feel like I had truly followed a journey like this one had. It felt huge and had a fantastic cast of characters that were a joy to watch. 

3. **[Cowboy Bebop](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) -** I can't help myself, Cowboy Bebop just had to go on my list. Easily the best English dub of any anime IMO, and the stories are all so great. Still holds up so well after two decades.

4. **[Azumanga Daioh](https://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh) -** The best slice-of-life anime of all time from my perspective, and the show that made me love this genre. Such a memorable cast and incredibly funny. The manga is also fantastic, and probably my favorite 4-koma.

5. **[Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) -** This is a show that I watched once, and that was enough for me. I'd felt so emotionally torn by this show, and I fucking loved it.

6. **[Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33206/Kobayashi-san_Chi_no_Maid_Dragon) -** IMO, the best show KyoAni has ever made. It's adorable, gorgeous to watch, and has such a wonderful and endearing cast, and the stories itself were so pleasant to watch. Season 2 when?

7. **[Trigun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) -** My second favorite space western following Bebop, it's kinda hard to explain what exactly made it work so well for me. It just had so much that worked for what I was looking for, from an engaging story and characters, some great animation, and also having a pretty damn good dub.

8. **[Kemono Friends](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33089/Kemono_Friends) -** I think this one just surprised me with how good it actually was. Just on the surface, it seems like it should be a total bomb, and yet it had a truly endearing and engaging cast and a surprisingly dark story and world. I had such a good time watching, and it's truly a show that proves you can't judge a book by its cover.

9. **[Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) -** Probably the best execution of time travel I've ever seen in any medium. It felt like a mindfuck, but the best kind where it bends your brain but doesn't lose you. It's also IMO the best character that J. Michael Tatum has ever dubbed.

10. **[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist) -** One of the first shows that I started when I was getting into anime, it's another show that's hard to explain why I loved it, but just that it all came together in a packaged the I felt was fantastic to watch.",best anime
