In most states there is an actual law for this. Theyre REQUIRED to check after the 3rd day almost always.

"International play is exactly what I'm referring to. His play has been excellent until he gets to a final. Then he shits the bed. He absolutely is both more talented and more athletic than Maradona ever was but he hasn't been able to carry his country to the win. I also believe the players around Messi are far more talented than the ones Maradona played with. Maradona played a much larger  role in his teams success than Messi has. I do have Messi at #2 and would certainly move him ahead if he gets over the yips in 2018.
Comparing stats for players from different eras is just as flawed as it is in the NFL. Rule changes to promote scoring have been very effective and play just as much a role as the better training and athleticism of today's athletes has."
I have noticed any smells coming from my friend's hedgehog. But I don't really see the hedgehog much. Nocturnal.

"From a range of different categories. 

[Stein's Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) - Easily one of the best.  It starts a little slow, but when it hits full steam it doesn't stop.  

[Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni) - This anime IMO falls more under the mystery and suspense umbrella.  What sets this one apart is the story telling which leaves you asking questions and constantly throwing wrenches in your theory.  By in far it was one of my all time favorites because the story telling is so masterful. (Can't tell you how though! That will spoil the first 5 episodes!)

This anime does have a few scenes that can get really intense gore wise; however, I would say it's really only about 4-5 scenes in the first season and by the second season there aren't any scenes like that. So it is not a 24/7 gore fest.  But even with these scenes there are also many very light hearted sections which control the pacing of the story. 

*I would say this is a must watch!*

[Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood) - One of the easiest animes to get into for newer viewers.  I've rarely found anyone who didn't like the series.  It's very well done and appeals to a large audience. 

[Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) - This one you sorta have to wade through the average first season to get to, but the climax of this series is the one that people remember.  Definitely more on the emotional side, but it does leave an impact. 

[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) - One of the better slice of life/comedy anime IMO.  It's sorta a non-sequitur style, but still likable and easy for many to watch"

"Exactly. Like she is supposed to be Ms Body Positive and had the revenge body tv show which was catered at helping people feel good about their weight but decided to call Jordyn Fat on KUWTK. 

The thing that pisses me off the most about that is sheâ€™s a producer, they would have looked at all the footage and even if she had said that in a moment of anger she could have opted for it to be cut. Leaving it in really shows her personality and the way she treats others.

Itâ€™s like her playing the victim and showing how â€˜upsetâ€™ she was after the backlash she received from Twitter about her actions. She genuinely in her warped mind thought that referring to women as bitches and saying they have to stay away from her man and calling Jordyn fat would have got her lots of support. 

If you canâ€™t tell sheâ€™s my least favourite KarJenner ðŸ˜‚"
"So you know Free Willy? Yeah I met him when I was a kid... I got to feed him fish and pet his head... even rubbed his tongue and he was super nice and didn't bite my arm off. 

Keiko, what a great guy. Seriously, they say he is a killer whale and he spared me... such an outstanding orca."

"I bought these German tissues at a clearance store (similar to TJ Maxx) and they were very thick. They were similar in texture to the fancier kind of paper napkin. Its not like anything that's sold in the US as a tissue. 

OP, try these: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vanity-Fair-White-Paper-Napkins-100-Pack-35501/303197716](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vanity-Fair-White-Paper-Napkins-100-Pack-35501/303197716)

The brand should be available almost anywhere -- Target, a big grocery store, Wal-Mart, and as linked, Home Depot."
"We (Switzerland) have really dropped since the 4th place in the Nations League in 2019. We were consistently ranked somewhere around the 8h place im the ranking, our performance have been quite shit over the last few matches.

Lichtsteiner retiring hasn't really helped us either, we lost a quality leader with him. Not sure if Petkovic should stay much longer to be honest."
"My daughter did that: chemistry and philosophy. But then she went to law school, and it turns out that philosophy is great preparation for law school, with courses like logic and ethics.

She's now a patent attorney (the science degree is necessary to get hired) and she's doing very well."
"Dude here - that's what I wear, and I can't tell you how many compliments I've gotten on it. Funny thing is, my ex-wife bought it for me right before things went down the drain. Thanks, dear!"

"For what it meant at the time, and how differently sonically it was, both ATLiens and Aquemini need to be considered for a top 10 list.  ATLiens specifically shifted attention of the culture to the south in a way that just didn't exist beforehand.  

When we're talking about a GOAT album, I think that impact on the culture is as important a deciding factor as the quality of the album is. There are a lot of subjectively outstanding albums from a musical standpoint, but far fewer that were cultural landmarks. ATLiens shifted hip hop culture away from the binary east coast/west coast focus that has previously existed and deserves consideration for GOAT imo.  This is coming from someone who on reflex says ""Illmatic"" and has for a few decades as well, but some relistens and rethinks on this topic recently has shifted my opinion somewhat."
