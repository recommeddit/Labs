4534,best text editor,"Vim personally. Simple, but has everything I need. I've looked into other options, but personally none provide anything that would make me want to stay. Emacs seemed promising, but I quickly learned that it would be a challenge because I was born deformed (I only have 10 fingers)."

5481,best home improvement store,I know— but it’s better than nothing. I ended up buying from there for garden bed supplies and it was nice to basically get a gift card back.
67161,best places to skydive in california,"It's not any more dangerous than an 18-year-old skydiving.  Drop zones are concerned about liability, though, and in the USA this becomes exponentially more complicated when someone under 18 is involved."
59504,best perfume,"Feminine, in touch with your emotions and proud of it--except for what you would consider the more base emotions like anger, which you strongly abhor."
59988,best perfume,"Many of the Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea line. I've only disliked one of the several I've tried, Green Tea Mimosa. The rest have all been likable to one degree or another. And they're really inexpensive."

52301,best hiphop album,"The 90s East Coast bias was always justified though: better producers, better lyricists, better concepts, classic LPs like Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, 36 Chambers, OB4CL, Capital Punishment, IDAHIH, The Sun Rises In The East....plus it's the damn birthplace of this genre. What's to hate?

Also, most of the 90s West Coast g-funk was fucking dumpster juice anyway."

2901,best headphones,"Hard to say. Everyone is different.

I currently own Sennheiser HD58X, Philips Fidelio X2HR, Philips SHP9500 and AKG K702.

I found the 58X and X2HR not very good for FPS gaming where as they are recommended often (And why I bought them in the first place). The SHP9500 are better for gaming for me although no patch on the K702 imo."

54479,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"First off thanks for the great review, cleared up some things for me. One question I do have is how does the glide of the raiden compare to that of the otsu v2? I am currently deciding whether or not I want to try out a v2 but I also really love the raiden's glide and I wouldn't want to lose too much of that. I just want to confirm with someone who owns both pads before I pull the trigger on a new otsu v2. Thanks in advance"
