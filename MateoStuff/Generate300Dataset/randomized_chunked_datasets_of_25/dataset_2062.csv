39651,best podcast for biologists,"[Skeptics' Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) - A weekly podcast kind of in the format of an unscripted radio show.  They've been around for more than a decade at this point.  They read science news and discuss it plus have segments where they play weird noises and the audience sends in their guess or where Steve presents the other hosts with 3 science new items and they have to figure out which one he made up.  The show focuses on critical thinking and they have an older (now abandoned) spinoff podcast called [5x5](https://legacy.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/5x5) which were 5 minute mini episodes about one particular science or critical thinking topic, 100+ episodes of that spinoff and the info is still good.  The SGU also host and attend science and skepticism conferences.

[Skeptoid](https://skeptoid.com/) - A weekly essay on a particular pseudoscience topic be it a ghost sighting, missing ship, unexplained light, conspiracy, etc.  The host does a good job providing sources on all the transcripts and puts out correction episodes any time he gets something wrong.  Educators can get a free premium subscription to get the podcast without ads and get the full podcast archive (free one is only the latest 50 episodes).  They also have a [teacher's toolkit](https://skeptoid.com/teachers) and 2 documentaries available on Youtube: [Principles of Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKY6jJbyCo0) and the much older [Here Be Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=752V173e31o), with a third documentary (Science Friction) supposedly coming soon.  Some episodes of the podcast also make it onto [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8s6jngYwoGTFCnKyknOT6g) which can make it easy to share in class.

[Mindscape](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) - Hosted by physicist Sean Carroll this is a more standard interview style podcast with scientists and philosophers, sometimes he has episodes where it's just him talking about a particular topic in physics."

33557,best electric car,It’s interesting that for someone with “no brands wars” as their flair you certainly do like to highlight the differences when it doesn’t favour Tesla
35898,best alcoholic drink,"Yes, definitely. And no one would drink from your drink as most people think that it tastes like medicine."
58990,best perfume,"Philosykos doesn’t last on me either, which is why I wear Fico de Amalfi by Acqua de Parma. It just wears all day on me and is a very similar green fig to Philosykos."
70357,best major to study in college,"why think that way? STEM is hard for sure, sometimes harder for others, but those who do seem to naturally get it seem to often have a strong STEM background that they grew up used to. I’d say take the challenge. It seems daunting and you’ll study a lot but in the end it’ll all be worth it for a STEM degree.

Idk I just dislike seeing you put yourself down like that :("

25871,best cricket teams of all time,It was a joke. I am well aware that no Test has lasted for two years.
33513,best electric car,"While reading the article I found something that invalidated the results for me. The Tesla drivers rolled along with the HVAC off in 65F weather and endured 86F in the cabin. Those traveling with heat-sensitive passengers like babies in car seats and diapers will not tolerate this experience well. C&D's article made no mention of HVAC settings other than the above, thus leaving us all in the dark.

EE didn't address this energy-saving aspect in his charts either, so he joined the obfuscation club as well.

To me, we are at a point where real-world usage must be depicted in these reviews/media. Tesla's been slinging EVs out the door for a decade now. The Leaf is how old now, 7 years or so? 

I'm not sure what the EPA uses for HVAC settings but I hazard that 70F in winter and 75F in summer is reasonable. I'd love to see the results of C&D's 1,000 mile trip using the above settings. As a potential EV buyer in 3 years this is the kind of info I need, how will the EV behave when I use one? 

Rant incoming - And yes, I would expect this demand would help push back against the glass roofs that are fashionable/unavoidable right now as the thermal gain of these will matter in this kind of standardized testing. I would love to see the impact on driver fatigue found with the overhead glare caused by glass roofs and the current fashion of flat screens/shiny plastic/chrome bits in the center consoles. The blinding we receive is a road hazard, much like phone screens in use by the front seat passenger."
