8656,best toothpaste,"My SO's mom is a dental hygienist, she recommends pronamel as it strengthens your enamel. I (not a dental professional) recommend Rembrandt Canker Sore for those seriously prone to canker sores."
21177,best workout music,"I find electro to be great workout music. There's always a buildup, a bass drop, and breaks for the crowd - while still maintaining a steady beat throughout. Personally I like some crazy skrillex, wolfgang gartner or pendulum when I'm lifting (say what you will about the skrillex's ""musical"" status, but that shit pumps you UP), something more mellow and melodic like deadmau5, vitalic or tiesto while running. I don't even listen to the stuff on a regular basis, only when working out."
20182,best workout music,I prefer calm like a bomb. That intro.
55701,best action and adventure novel series,"What do they add to the story? The only planetside Jack Crow scenes that matter are those in which they actually interface with the combat suit at all, and those are few and far between. The rest has so much filler that by the end of the novel I'd forgotten why Crow had gone to the research facility in the first place."

5072,best home improvement store,"I've seen pets at HD, but when I checked their website about a year ago, the official policy was only service animals.  The sign at the front door of my local HD says the same thing.  I probably could take the dog, but when someone's kid runs up and pokes her in the butthole, and she turns around and barks and scares them, I don't want to have to deal with the drama of her technically not supposed to have been there."

15939,best sunglasses for fashion,"You know sometimes I want to make sure I have a genuine product and a quality one too. So I'll pay a little extra to have that, I can afford it. It's a bit of a pride thing for me to not order fake junk from China. The only time I've ever ordered from one of those websites was in college to get an NBA jersey to get blacked out in on the weekends."
