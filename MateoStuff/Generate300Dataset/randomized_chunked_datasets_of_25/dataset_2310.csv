72052,best movies with a cool twist,"It was a cool twist, but later all I could think about was that I'd be able to tell if he was alive. I know the, ""that's the whole point, you wouldn't"" argument. I just can't help it."

26267,best politician,Of course it's racist. It's racism under the veil of freedom of association. One person's rights end when they infringe on another's rights. It's like not allowing African Americans to not eat in your private establishment restaurant.

65218,best phone service company,"I agree the AT&T plan is one of the best [cheap cell phone plans](https://dailygizmo.net/cheap-cell-phone-plans/) it is sort of like one of those limited/unlimited plans since it switches to I think 2G data if you exceed your limit.

5096,best home improvement store,"Yeah I got a few things I ordered relatively quickly but after waiting another week I realized they cancelled half of the items without ever telling me. 

Their system is whack. I ordered a couple ceiling fans, 14/3 Romex, switches, face plates, etc and they would mail like 1 box with 1 face plate and another box with another face plate and another separate box with a switch in it. It was the romex and junction box they just randomly dropped off the order for no reason."
1984,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I'll defend Rusty's. It's my favorite ""fast food"" delivery style place in the area.

3152,best webcamera,"Look at all of Logitechs offerings. If you really want to get the most out of it, you will have to learn about lighting and composition. There are lots of YT videos about it, but they all share the same thought: any camera will suck out of the box... proper (not necessarily expensive) lighting is what will make any shot look amazing. If you have an RTX card, you can have the ability to blur out the background."
