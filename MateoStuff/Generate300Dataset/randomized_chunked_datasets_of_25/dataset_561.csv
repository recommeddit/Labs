33987,best Pokemon game,I'd say Lets Go Evee/Pikachu and if you really enjoy the games then I'd play either Pokemon Shield or Sword. Or if you want to wait to play an older generation game wait for Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl which comes out in a few months! :)
61214,Best comedy show on Netflix,I loved that show and hated that it ended but I don't know how it could have gone on without Michael Clark Duncan.
47986,best color to paint with,"Same here. Huuuuuuge mistake. 

Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.

Also had a friend who's parents painted their dining room that red. It was like eating in a murder room. Definitely not appetizing or good for social contact. It was oppressive."

7288,best iPhone,"Replaced my 6s with the XR almost two months ago. Lovin it!!! Definitely recommend this phone, but not if you pretend to keep it for 4-5 years (although I find it difficult to stay with the same phone for that long)."
43549,best items under $100,but it's a *vinyl* bathroom car
15560,best tree for the garden,I will look to find deer solutions if I don't have any fences. Thanks!
7781,best laptop for general use,"I see... it depends on how much gaming performance you want. If your expectations aren't very high, you might be fine with just the integrated graphics. So, aside from that, it comes down to whether or not you can make good use of the 2-in-1 feature."
51260,best iphone case,How good would you say is the drop protection? I just bought the Mag Armor but like the look of the liquid air armor. I do tend to drop my phone quite a bit since I’m clumsy.
17336,best iOS game,Thanks for your hard work.
58406,best cologne,"If you're looking for a 'signature scent' which is an olfactory summary of your individualism, why buy something that quite literally millions of others wear on a daily basis?

Furthermore, for every woman who would lick your neck for a sniff of Aqua Di Gio, there is another who would chew off her own arms to get away. That's the problem with wearing a common fragrance - many people will have a negative reaction to it.

Do you want to smell like pure sex? Do you want to be an individual? I'd drop a few extra pennies on something by Serge Lutens, By Kilian, Frederic Malle or Creed. You could go for old world glamour by going for an older Guerlain like Habit Rouge. Bulgari Black is a personal favourite, it is utterly individual and won't break the bank.

Whatever you do, test, test, test! Put it on and wear it out. See how others respond. See how you like it. 

I own roughly 120 scents and am trying to write about these things for a living. Tell me what you like and I'll be happy to make suggestions.

For what it is worth, Aqua Di Gio makes me sick, but Old Spice is a classic."
63698,best books for time management reddit,"The Power of Full Engagement. Not time management, energy management."
28715,best breakfast foods,Something that seems to disgust people is that it's common to have caviar on boiled eggs for breakfast in Sweden. Caviar on sandwiches as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalles_kaviar

27886,best breakfast foods,"Same here, but I fill it up with stuff. Berries, eggs, almond butter, cinnamon, cottage cheese, honey, bananas... Its actually getting a little out of hand now that I think about it."
4076,best online college,"Ok, thanks, that is not my realm. 

How did you like it though?"
28277,best breakfast foods,"Diner level greasy over easy eggs. Three of them with a piece of toast. 1/2 -1 tbsp of butter, 3 eggs, then throw some salt, pepper, and my homemade hobanero flakes on them. I have a hard time getting through the day without this breakfast."
60482,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I am really trying to watch that show, but I find it incredibly boring."
67893,best science fiction novel,"> Joyce's Ulysses is my nemesis

I had to write a twelve page paper on Joyce's Ulysses in my  senior year of college. If we hadn't been discussing it as a class, I probably would have had a harder time following it. Although I think that part of the trick is to approach it in the same spirit that you would science fiction. Go in with the understanding that you aren't going to understand large parts of it and just assume that you're going to learn via the osmosis of reading. Without some background, you're probably not going to follow it past the first couple of chapters. But if you just accept the fact that you don't understand it and can remain calm about your own confusion, you can get through it."
