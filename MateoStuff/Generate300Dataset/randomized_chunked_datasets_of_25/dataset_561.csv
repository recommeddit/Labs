Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.

58406,"If you're looking for a 'signature scent' which is an olfactory summary of your individualism, why buy something that quite literally millions of others wear on a daily basis?

Furthermore, for every woman who would lick your neck for a sniff of Aqua Di Gio, there is another who would chew off her own arms to get away. That's the problem with wearing a common fragrance - many people will have a negative reaction to it.

Do you want to smell like pure sex? Do you want to be an individual? I'd drop a few extra pennies on something by Serge Lutens, By Kilian, Frederic Malle or Creed. You could go for old world glamour by going for an older Guerlain like Habit Rouge. Bulgari Black is a personal favourite, it is utterly individual and won't break the bank.

Whatever you do, test, test, test! Put it on and wear it out. See how others respond. See how you like it. 

I own roughly 120 scents and am trying to write about these things for a living. Tell me what you like and I'll be happy to make suggestions.

For what it is worth, Aqua Di Gio makes me sick, but Old Spice is a classic.",best cologne

67893,"> Joyce's Ulysses is my nemesis

I had to write a twelve page paper on Joyce's Ulysses in my  senior year of college. If we hadn't been discussing it as a class, I probably would have had a harder time following it. Although I think that part of the trick is to approach it in the same spirit that you would science fiction. Go in with the understanding that you aren't going to understand large parts of it and just assume that you're going to learn via the osmosis of reading. Without some background, you're probably not going to follow it past the first couple of chapters. But if you just accept the fact that you don't understand it and can remain calm about your own confusion, you can get through it.",best science fiction novel
