7409,best laptop for general use,I see. I was actually looking at the Lenovo ones. Do you recommend any of those? I would prefer a big screen and touch screen display so maybe those 2 in 1 laptops?
25994,best politician,"I think that Rand Paul & Sanders have honest moral convictions that aren’t easily swayed by political correctness or even popular opinion. I only personally agree with one of them, but I at least respect them both."
62920,Best Data Science textbook,Joel Grus
40752,best instrument to play,"Kazoo, hands down one of the most satisfying instruments ever devised."
8293,best toothpaste,Yup. I switched to an electric and explicitly did *not* inform my dental hygienist to avoid confirmation bias. She noticed anyway.
13608,best research paper archive,"Even better when your professor wrote the textbook for the course.

""I know it says there is a required textbook for this course, but don't bother. You'll notice the author is me, I will teach you everything."""
20354,best workout music,Night core is my go to cardio music. So bouncy & upbeat & definitely pretty gay. Love it though
42704,best detective show,Bosch! On Amazon Prime. Love the main character. Love everything about it.
35411,best alcoholic drink,Slightly better booze will mask easier. Kirkland vodka is stupidly easy to hide in any mixer.
66846,best soccer team in the world,"Sport? Yes.

Politics? Hell no."
57808,best cologne,"Really, never knew that they had one! Where you get it from?"
4251,best text editor,"C is still widely used. Sure, web folks don't use it, but it's the defacto microcontroller language, and we're surrounded by them. Plus, there's tons of ECUs in cars running C code. As an embedded engineer I had to reply :)"
57952,best cologne,"Gay man here. I've gone through dozens of cologne over the years and I currently have 11 bottles in the bathroom. Needless to say, I love the stuff. 

My favorite of all time is Sentiment by Escada. No other scent I've worn has even gotten close to the number of compliments I've gotten while having it on. You can't find it in stores anymore so buy it online (make sure its the cologne, not the perfume). Best part is that it wasn't widely distributed so you'll smell unique! My second favorite is Gucci Pour Hommes II."
68938,best science fiction novel,"*\*tips fedora\**

M'lady..."
70479,best major to study in college,"I feel the same way, but I seem to run into a lot of people who look like they're just in college to party and have a good time.  Not that I don't enjoy that, but my grades come first.  I live in America and I definitely feel like English (and a lot of other non-STEM majors) has really lost a lot of respect academically and in the world at large.  The work is definitely not as easy as it might seem!  As far as jobs, it's definitely true that the skills you learn in English apply all over the place.  It's tough (I hear) to find a job directly related to your field, but that's not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."
4925,best home improvement store,"In the past, I used Amazon.  I would just plug in what I needed, and go for their top-seller.  This is good for new cash-strapped homeowners, but it’s usually a cheaper-quality item.

Now, I use consumer reports to find the item I want, and then I use price comparison sites to search for the best price."
40744,best instrument to play,drums
41018,best instrument to play,"If we are counting midi. I say the drum pad controller is easiest because you can basically remap your buttons to have the same pathway while trigger a different sound. and edit audio to be as long or short as you want, can loop what you want or not at all. Have one button play chord or have to play each note separately."
63247,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Zebra is on [https://xtm3x.github.io/repo](https://xtm3x.github.io/repo), and you can switch to u0 dark to get Sileo."
23301,best car racing video game,I play Project: Cars
54471,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Soft... Mid isn't great IMO. It makes the pad a bit too fast and hard to dig in. Also the grip doesn't work as good in the mid. I only recommend mid for Raiden and shidenkai cause those are fast anyway.

For hien, otsu v2, and zero, def go soft or xsoft."
28107,best breakfast foods,"Well I recently had a waffle with bacon baked into it topped with strawberries Sirracha sauce, so I’d have to say that."
39497,best web browser,How does Firefox Focus rate?
64183,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Is there something like this for german audiobooks?
63643,best books for time management reddit,Fair enough but if it takes three minutes to read a page it's a 13 hour read. Maybe afternoon was not realistic but I read it in one day and it's not all I did.
