"Yep. Frankly didn't love it as much as plain old TF but I can see the appeal. Having owned Aventus I am not actually as impressed with it as many are, but it is the best selling Creed for a reason."
"Female, 30+ single, works in management"
Honestly Riverdale S1 was a pretty well told whodunnit. Of course everything after that is almost incomprehensible but I maintain the opinion that season 1 was legitimately good TV
dude look up all the frequency response graphs for al of those headphones and then compare it to sennheisers headphones that are in that price range.
"I have a Dell S2716DG which has been fantastic. It’s a TN panel, but has great colors. The early revisions had problems with color banding, but they fixed that later. 
It’s got G-Sync and runs about $599, but you can often find it on sale for like $450. 

I’d recommend it happily."
"> Spain is FIRE friendly. 

How about in terms of raising family? 

> New Zealand is great 

In what ways?"
"I've worked with a few celebrities and athletes in the past, in a different capacity than hospitality. The ones I worked with *always* used fake names, plus their room was actually reserved and paid for by their assistants so their name never showed on paperwork. However, since they were listed as staying in the room, their name was added to the card, and that's where the fake name comes in.

One guy, the late author Tom Clancy, always used the name of his lead character, Jack Ryan when getting a room."
"I ended up doing this for accent walls in my apartment. I got some brown-ish miniblinds to help block out sunlight (my windows face the sunset, not a meth cooker) ended up taking one of the extra bits to hardware store and they colomatched a paint based on them.

Worked out great, so my theme is.. well.. brown. Light brown and wood."
I answer almost the same without looking to the other answers *-*
"‘Men of Honor’ series by K.C Lynn. Pretty much all of her books are my favorite go-to. 
Natasha Madison and Aurora Rose Reynolds are also pretty much automatic downloads for me as well!"
Senna is my second best movie on the list. That guy had all the money but still he worked so hard and was so ruthless in driving. Great one to watch.

(i'm just kidding, fuck that noise, I just use Fetch)"
That whole album is still a classic. There was a whole summer where Flockaveli was the only CD listened to when working out.
I need to buy a large appliance (range) from Lowe's. Can you PM the spreadsheet please?

"You don't need all these fancy pens and pencils. Just get a decent set of pencils and a nice eraser. You don't wanna come home after spending a boat load of money, draw two times, and then never draw again."
"I currently make Gorgonzola and ricotta gelati for my menu at work. Both have gorgeous textures. [This](http://cafebacaro.blogspot.com/2012/10/gorgonzola-gelato.html) is the Gorgonzola recipe I've been using, and [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/11/easy-ricotta-gelato-recipe.html) is the ricotta one. They're both on the softer size, smooth, perfectly scoopable with great clarity of flavor. AND they're both super easy!"
It was also reported that Theranos is partnering with them for their upcoming project
Since it seems that no one has mentioned it I will just draw your attention to Numbers which is made by Apple. I have it but I rarely use it so I do not know how well it replaces Excel but it might be worth checking out.
"Hello, 

I was looking for a general utility laptop. I want to be able to be creative and edit simple videos and upload videos for vlogging. I also like to be creative. somewhere around the 500$ I can shell out if the price is right."
"I'm a big fan of Curve Crush. I used it a lot as a teen and recently started using the body spray again. Perhaps it's my nostalgic bias, but it's one of my all-time favorite scents."
"Really solid list, kinda just nodded my head in agreement through most of it. Not sure I'd put Stand Alone Complex below Steins;Gate or Mob Psycho below Made in Abyss but that comes down to preference."
