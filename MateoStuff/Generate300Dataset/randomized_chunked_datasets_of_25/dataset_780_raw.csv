I wanted to get that one but they don't sell it in the UK
"I'm going to assume that by cold you mean extremely severe cold-like allergy symptoms and not an actual virus, because that's what I'm experienced with.

1. 1-6 benadryl depending on severity of symptoms
2. Afrin
3. Neti Pot
4. Bed.

I also find eating ice cream or something else that is cold to be temporarily soothing, if it doesn't actually help with symptoms. Don't discount alcohol or weed. Sure won't do anything to help but you won't notice as much."

I once fell asleep while browsing a giant coffee table photo book of the Civil War and dreamed about moustaches.

"PPG Dapper Tan is a nice warm beige, Sherwin Williams Pillowcase (I think this might be exclusive to the Lowe's Sherwin Williams line -- I got it color matched in PPG) is a warmer khaki cream shade."
You're assuming OP can date out of his/her league.

"[Following](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Following/60000574?locale=en-US) feels very similar to Memento at times, though it is very low budget.  It is one of Christopher Nolan's first films, and it has some of the same themes and ideas as Memento, and possibly even Inception.

But yeah, since you like Nolan's other films, I'd definitely check it out!"
"I make an egg quiche and it lasts all week. No crust just eggs and veggies and some sort of cheese like feta or goat or whatever really
- glass pie baking plate
- add whatever veggies you have , spinach, kale, sautéed onions, mushrooms, tomato, bell peppers (you can use all or none) 
Add those to the baking plate
- mix 4 eggs pour it over the veggies
- grab cheese and throw it in too
- bake 350 for 45 min
It's fairly easy and you can cut a slice out for breakfast every day 
- if you make it thin you can prob eat it in the car. Last week I literally just had 3 eggs worth and kale so it ended like a thin crust pizza. Usually it's thicker so that might be a sloppy mess"
Don't you still have to buy filters?
"But...damn, her hands cupping your D cup man boobs...how awesome is that?"
There is nothing special about sensodyne other than it contains an added ingredient called potassium nitrate for sensitivity.  It still contains fluoride and can be used as your daily toothpaste.  The only reason they put the warning on the label to discontinue use and call your dentist if sensitivity continues is because there are ppl out there who are “sensitive” because they have a huge cavity or abscess that cannot be cured with any toothpaste. I’m a hygienist and I use sensodyne every day because I like the light mint flavor. Lol

Try it and then tell. Edge is really snappy compared to any other browser. Somehow Microsoft managed to do it even with telemetry
It's also available through Xbox game pass on PC(since the EA play is a given with xbox game pass.)

If you had to pick one which one would you choose? Also a specific book by that author that particularly shines?
"Notepad++ is perfectly fine.  If you want the features of an IDE, perhaps try Visual Studio."
