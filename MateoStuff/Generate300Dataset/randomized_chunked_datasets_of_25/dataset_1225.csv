Lora Leigh writes a mix of things but is a lot heavier on the sex."

10674,best suitcase lock,"I don’t think anyone actually thinks these locks will stop someone truly motivated from stealing anything. 

They just prevent opportunistic thieves and prevent your bag from coming open and spilling everywhere if one of the pulls gets caught or snagged. 

Concealed zippers and travel film won’t prevent any motivated thief either. 

Kind of a poor LPT"

26052,best politician,"I genuinely trust my representatives in Congress: Patty Murray, Maria Cantwell and Pramila Jayapal (though I may sadly be leaving her district soon). Cantwell I had all kinds of reservations about when she first ran, but she's exceeded my expectations by quite a bit. More locally, Bob Ferguson's been excellent as AG, with a serious focus on protecting consumers and civil liberties rather than the usual lock 'em up as long as possible that AGs often go for."

47614,best state to visit in the United States,"It really is. Niagara Falls, NY is basically a run-down Rust Belt city with not much to do (other than walk around the state park... it's a great park, to be fair). 

The Canadian side has a bunch of really good restaurants, bars, casinos, etc. - and you can get way closer to the falls than you can on the other side. And the view of all 3 falls is a lot better from Ontario than New York."
