9653,"If you're torn between Santa Cruz and Anacapa, here's some stuff to consider. Santa Cruz was recently renovated, and everything is brand new. It also has a movie theatre that is available to all residents, where you can borrow movies from the front desk or attach a laptop or an Xbox with an HDMI cable. Santa Cruz is also right next to DLG, the best dining commons on campus (not that Anacapa is much farther!) Santa Cruz is also closest to Campus Point, the most beautiful beach on campus (that is why I chose it.) Anacapa is slightly closer to campus; if you're riding your bike back to Santa Cruz, you always pass Anacapa. But beyond that, it really doesn't have any advantages. It seems like Anacapa has prettier girls this year but that's not important for you!",best dorm hall at UCSB

45034,I had mine for a year but now the USB port is kind of finicky. Kind of disappointed. Went to buy another one but didn't see Anker. Got one for about $40 but it's plastic and can only charge my phone maybe twice before running out of juice. Need to order a new Anker online.

22890,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but I guess every year he does this event at SF Zoo where someone can buy, in an auction, a slumber party at SF Zoo and then get to have dinner with and a story read by Robin Williams. My dad's best friend had a bidding war with another lady, but was ultimately outbid. When RW heard about it, he agreed to do two nights, one for the lady and one for my dad's friend. 

I can never thank RW enough for doing that. It had been about a month after my father passed away, and needless to say my family was devastated. We almost couldn't handle going. But I'm glad we did; he was such an amazing person that for one night my family was happy. He laughed when I called him Mr. Williams, and read us ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". He was so nice and I'll always be grateful to him.",best celebrity
