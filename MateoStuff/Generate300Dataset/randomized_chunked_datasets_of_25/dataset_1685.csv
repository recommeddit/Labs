54941,best water filter,"Carbon filters will take out the chlorine in the water, they may also have some multimedia (sand, gravel, etc) in there as well to catch some of the suspended solids in the water as well.

What the filters won't do is 1.) Soften the water (removal of calcium and magnesium) 2.) Filter out TDS (Total Dissolved Solids- minerals, chemicals, etc) or 3.) Deionization/add resisitivity."

2891,best headphones,"Another vote for pc38x, I've had them since they came out. I think they're super comfortable, personally I like open ear headphones for gaming because I still like to hear what's going on around me while I play games."

68341,best science fiction novel,No tears for Yueh.
67924,best science fiction novel,"It's absolutely a tour de force. A first contact story, a space opera, a mystery story, a thriller; it is so tightly plotted most SF screenwriters should commit *seppuku* in front of a copy. I'm a little unenthusiastic about the romance thread, but it doesn't detract from the main story.

I would so watch a movie made of the book (always provided, of course, that they keep Ridley Scott away from it) and that would now be possible, as was demonstrated by *District 9*.

It would just wipe the floor with utter bullshit like *Avatar*."
