I have the G7 and it’s perfect. Am pretty confident they have fixed the previous issues you outlined.
Not very good. I wouldn’t use it for anything other than trim.
"Hey, be mindful of spoilers man."
Huh?
"You can give assassins creed odyssey a try, not as in-depth as most RPGs but still fun nonetheless."
I don't give a fuck about Dignam!
"My girlfriend got me some Rogue by Rhianna which smells great, but the one I wear that never fails to get a compliment or a question as to what I'm wearing is Caesar Man.  Every time."
"What does ""they are discounting 10k off easy"" mean? I'm a prospective buyer so am curious how I'd get that discount if I went with Chevy."
Totally agree with you. Her writing is so good.

"Western medicine is designed to treat symptoms. Mucinex keeps you from feeling mucus buildup. Tylenol reduces your fever. None of these name brand medicines actually improve your overall health.

These home remedies allow your body to purge toxins. Sometimes, by eating the right things and avoiding putting more chemicals in your body, you will feel worse before you feel better. You may have so many toxins in you that it hurts you, at first, to get rid of them (ex: ppl quit cigarettes, then get very sick).

Our OTC medicine is not making our bodies healthier. It is only blocking the symptoms.

Try the home remedies. They are better for you."

"in program help key - isn't `?` working for you?

latest version shows the selected files with a `+` before them.

multi-select key is `^Y`.

Context use clues: every help string needs memory to store, in addition, to show the help in a new window, each time we will have to draw it, show and then remove it and adjust the window below it as well. The keystrokes in `nnn` are far simpler than those in `vim` and far less as well. I think going for this kind of a program help mechanism would be a overkill."
"Being able to pick the best jobs assumes there is a diversity of jobs and opportunities.  The boom of all inclusive, reduces the number and diversity of jobs and opportunities, which puts huge downward pressure on wages.   So I would say it matters where LightningReptar chooses to stay in any given destination."
"Awesome, it sounds like a great listen in lab! I work in a lab that does cancer research using drosophila as a model organism as an undergraduate intern."

"Loving these suggestions! I have recently learned of a Habitat ReStore. It’s like a goodwill for stuff that I typically find absurdly expensive and overpriced, and don’t care if it’s new or not: doors, ceiling fans, tools, lumber, etc. We just had a baby and it was a relief to find out about this place, so we could continue with some unexpected improvements, without spending a fortune. 

So, since I’ll be using these links, adding my two cents on this brick and mortar gem (depending on where you live). Habitat for Humanity ReStore."
"The Samsung's 110"" microLED TV but miniaturized to one eighth in size. Technically out of reach but a realistic expectation in the future. That's what ""Holy Grail"" means."
This is a much easier way to find the Hugo (etc) winners each year...
Apparently Adam Sandler?
"For me I went back and got my master's in Computer science after that.

I worked at Starbucks for a year after undergrad and couldn't find a job with my psych degree though I don't think it's impossible it's just fairly tough.

Working as a developer now and digging it."
