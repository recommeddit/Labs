Yes. The map excludes Disney and Universal parks.
"What did you check? 

You checked the trip advisor top all inclusive rankings and read every review did you? So much so you‚Äôd prefer a handful of Reddit opinions over thousands of verified reviews on TA?"
"I am not, half of my trips to Magic Mountain involve me wishing I had just gone to Knotts instead.  Often before I even make it into the park.  Twice I have been at SFMM stuck in lines at security, ticketing, and at the gate which left me waiting in total more than two hours to just get into the park.  Both times to find the lines inside the park moving with at worst like a 45 minute wait, frankly the park did not even feel that busy, those kinds of lines just to get into the park are unacceptable.

Combined with single train operations, frequent downtime, terrible food, lack of just about anything but coasters.  I have a much better time at Knotts.  A local might have a better opinion of the park, but as a tourist there are better ways to spend your day."
"You can find a ton of these if you spend like 5 minutes on google. I'm not sure why you haven't done this.

I googled these. These are all state schools.

Dragon's Dogma. Good variety of fantasy creatures/monsters to fight and some of the funnest combat in any game I have played.
"we don‚Äôt want you to know that the people who stayed in the room before you were fucking nasty.

housekeeping gets the brunt of it. i‚Äôve seen them carry out bags of used sex toys, peel used condoms off of every surface, and scrub shit - actual human (presumably) shit - off places there‚Äôs no reason for human shit to be.

the worst, though, was the couple that wanted a home birth but not, you know, at home (because gross). we had to deal with that hazmat situation. fucked them as hard as we could with penalties and fees, though."
Wait...is *THIS* an ad?
not in chapellhall
"I'll second that.  A bit of a slow start, and the NONSTOP."
Oh I love holding the real phone for a while when I clean it.  I just wish it was safe that way.

"I gotta say that Timepage may be the one with the best design, but I just can't get around the idea of subscribing to a calendar app. Do you use Timepage constantly throughout the day? What would you say are its key features?

"Thank you to everyone who has posted! The turnout on this has been far better than I expected! 

I've been browsing the dentistry subreddit (and posted this question here as well), and found some useful information on the abrasiveness of different toothpastes. 

[As you can see here](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0), some toothpastes (mostly those branded as ""whitening"" pastes) are so abrasive that the FDA actually considers them harmful to teeth, as they simply do too much damage to the enamel. Most of the users in the dentistry sub recommended toothpastes in the blue category, or the first half of the green category. Colgate Total was an often-recommended one, as it's low in abrasiveness, and uses Stannous Fluoride instead of Sodium Fluoride, which is better for the teeth in a few ways (but sometimes tastes a bit weirder to people)"
Lovely Finnish lady. I wouldn't mind finishing off with her...
"You are conflating the quality of the video that is captured by the camera and the quality of the compressed video that is streamed. 

A high quality video compressed to hell is still waaaay better than a low quality video streamed in 4k"

Just saw this movie! It reminded me of [Triangle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064/)
"I liked my Britta pitcher when I lived in town. It wasn't  too expensive, and I didn't have to replace the filter often. I did only get it for taste reasons though."
Either. Guitar is portable though. Unless you keytar it up!
My favorite part about that list is Ron Burgundy is the only name I read as a question.
"I had to re-read this a few times but I think I get it 

So after a bunch of loyalty rewards, you pay what I pay for a line normally? Except my carrier pays for my Netflix too.

I'm not sure you're helping the ""overpriced"" reputation."
Wow. Love your list!! üòçüòç
"For a more pumped up version, I prefer the cover by Save Ferris - actually pretty much anything Save Ferris/Ska is awesome music to pump you up for a workout."
