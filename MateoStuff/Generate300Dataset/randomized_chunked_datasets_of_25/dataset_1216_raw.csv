"I'd go for Southampton, they seem to be everyone's second favourite team in England. Have a terrific academy and just keep churning out fantastic young talent, Walcott, bale, oxlade-chamberlain, lallana etc. They sold most of their squad last summer, were seen as definite to be relegated, but with a fantastic manager have been toying with the prospect of European football most of this season as opposed to relegation."
"I want to provide a counter argument to this as about a year ago I bought about 7 perfumes all at once from never having bought my own perfume in my life.

I got some of the top recommended cheap and expensive perfumes but didn't want to shell out for Aventus and the ridiculous price but saw people recommend the knockoff Armaf version so tried it.
I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the only perfume that I ever got a compliment and random people asking what the smell was, at a cash register and i was dressed in sweatpants at the time.

It smells like lemon fresh when you put it on and I didn't see the appeal, but when the initial smell goes away and you forget about it, men and women both really like the smell although I have no idea if it smells like Aventus."
"I also upgraded from a 10 to a 12, that probably had a lot to do with it. My house has always been a bit of a dead zone with multiple carriers, dating back to the old Nextel days"

Nothing. She doesn't like Christmas (childhood issues) and doesn't want presents. I might make a donation to a charity in her name just to watch her being conflicted.

"Tbh, I’d put T-mobile up there with AT&T. Their coverage is pretty good and in some cases faster than them. Not to mention they have a better price. While, Verizon has the best coverage, I feel that they’re a bit overpriced and slower than AT&T and T-Mobile overall."

"From the 30s through to the mid 50s. They were at their best in the 50s with the ""Golden Team"" that laid the groundwork for Total Football, had a 50 match stretch where they lost just once (in the 1954 World Cup Final), and had a series of famous wins over footballing powerhouses. By far their most famous player of the time was Ferenc Puskas, who is one of the all time legends of the game, but he was surrounded by an incredible core of really talented players. I suggest reading up on it, because the rise and fall of that team is a really fascinating topic."
"I will just throw in my suggestion of ENEMY. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Slow burner of a film with great cinematography, score and a fantastic mind fuck of a story."
