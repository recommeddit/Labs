33510,"In my opinion Tesla builds the best EV, but not the best car that is an EV. I've driven a Model S, which I was surprised that I didn't like, and a Model 3, which I loathed. I've sat in a Model Y which felt like it had the build quality of a Yugo, or at least what I imagine the build quality of a Yugo to be.

I want a car that feels like a car but happens to be an EV. I've had two Nissan Leafs and while they have their issues, everything is where I expect it to be and operates like I expect it to operate.

I'm intrigued by the Mach-E which seems like it might be a better EV than the Leaf and a better car than a Tesla.",best electric car

Your mom or dad swabs their cheek then mails it back in, and NatGeo provides a detailed report on your family's lineage.  I got this for my mom for Mother's day to trace our maternal line.  (Bonus on this one:  It's a present for you too) -- https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com

Are you crafty or artistic?  I'm short on cash this year, so I found a place that sells reclaimed wood from barns that were torn down.  I'm going to paint something for my parents to hang in their house.  They have everything they need, so I figured a hand-painted piece of old barn wood would matter more to them than some crap they already have.",best gifts for mom
