45412,best gaming system,"Pc, PS4 and switch.

Pc is primary, I’d buy 99% of games on there.


PS4 is a glorified blu ray player tbh. Switch would get some use if the game prices weren’t rip offs. I picked up a visual novel on steam for £7 and it’s on switch for £35 or something nonsensical like that. Why waste money? 


I get more use out of my fat ps3 due to ps1 and 2 games being playable on there. At the moment I’m playing suikoden 2 for example, but I can load up breath of fire 3 or various other titles with ease. There’s not many ps3-4 titles that I can’t get on pc tho. 


I’d buy more on the ps3 if they unlocked the regions so we could be us exclusive ps1/2 era titles back when companies thought English was exclusive to the USA and Europe wasn’t a market. 😂🤦‍♂️ cos there’s so many games we missed out on in Europe :("

71330,best movies with a cool twist,Psycho is the gold standard for how to do it and do it right.
5492,best home improvement store,"You're paying for the convenience. The fact that you don't have to shop four different places to do a small project is where you make that money back. Also, the convenience of their hours.  I'd love to be able to support my local equipment rental when I need a jackhammer, but the rental shop closes at 530 and is only open half a day on Saturday. I can rent one from HD at 9:30 on a Monday night and be ready to work the next morning. Same with hardware. Have a really nice Ace by the house, but by the time I need supplies, their closed. It sucks, but the big boxes catered to the customer."
54362,best medicine for a cold,"You are going to be miserable for a whole week or longer, no matter what. You have nothing to lose if you try this: at first symptoms start taking 1000mg (one gram) of vitamin C every hour, -you cannot overdose, look it up-, until you begin to go to the bathroom (diarrhea), after 3 or more doses, cut back to 500mg every hour. Do this for one entire day (24 hours) or until your stomach is fairly empty. Your cold / flu will disappear within 2 days.
Very important: try to eat very light foods: fruits, vegetables; never white flour or any kind of sugar. Do use honey bee."
