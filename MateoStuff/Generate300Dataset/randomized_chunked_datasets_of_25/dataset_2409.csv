45412,"Pc, PS4 and switch.

Pc is primary, I’d buy 99% of games on there.


PS4 is a glorified blu ray player tbh. Switch would get some use if the game prices weren’t rip offs. I picked up a visual novel on steam for £7 and it’s on switch for £35 or something nonsensical like that. Why waste money? 


I get more use out of my fat ps3 due to ps1 and 2 games being playable on there. At the moment I’m playing suikoden 2 for example, but I can load up breath of fire 3 or various other titles with ease. There’s not many ps3-4 titles that I can’t get on pc tho. 


I’d buy more on the ps3 if they unlocked the regions so we could be us exclusive ps1/2 era titles back when companies thought English was exclusive to the USA and Europe wasn’t a market. 😂🤦‍♂️ cos there’s so many games we missed out on in Europe :(",best gaming system

5492,"You're paying for the convenience. The fact that you don't have to shop four different places to do a small project is where you make that money back. Also, the convenience of their hours.  I'd love to be able to support my local equipment rental when I need a jackhammer, but the rental shop closes at 530 and is only open half a day on Saturday. I can rent one from HD at 9:30 on a Monday night and be ready to work the next morning. Same with hardware. Have a really nice Ace by the house, but by the time I need supplies, their closed. It sucks, but the big boxes catered to the customer.",best home improvement store

You have nothing to lose if you try this: at first symptoms start taking 1000mg (one gram) of vitamin C every hour, -you cannot overdose, look it up-, until you begin to go to the bathroom (diarrhea), after 3 or more doses, cut back to 500mg every hour. Do this for one entire day (24 hours) or until your stomach is fairly empty. Your cold / flu will disappear within 2 days.
Very important: try to eat very light foods: fruits, vegetables; never white flour or any kind of sugar. Do use honey bee.",best medicine for a cold
