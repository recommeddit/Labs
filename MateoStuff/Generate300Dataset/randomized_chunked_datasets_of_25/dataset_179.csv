I'm currently about 50 hours into Persona 5 and I've been loving the experience. Very stylish and awesome music, as well. I'm not sure how well my recommendations will help you, considering I hated AC Origins and Odyssey, Horizon Zero Dawn, Life is Strange (is that considered an RPG?) and the new God of War. Seems you like open-world games or choice-based games. Good luck in your search!",Best RPG game on PS4

I liked Mint, but last time I used them they didn't have support for RSA key fob things.  That's a big deal for me since several of my bank accounts use them.
