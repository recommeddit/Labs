31460,best country to live in,There may be a disgusting amount of money to be made in North korea in the next decade or so.
59492,best perfume,For sure a man that likes death and maybe also black metal. I would suggest checking out Kouros based upon your top ten!
6709,best iPhone,I have the 11 pro and the battery life (which is the most important factor for me) is amazing. I've had it for a year and a half
14686,best romantic novel,"Haha I guess it just depends on what you mean by ""romance"". There is definitely some passion there, albeit one-sided."
22678,best celebrity,Luke is hotter
20653,best workout music,"Princeton Ave by Issues.  Gets me pumped and bust out the reps.

Hold Strong by Rob Baily and the Hustle Standard.   Makes me feel like I'm a bad ass."
33539,best electric car,It’s because it’s basically been the biggest topic in cars in the last decade
59951,best perfume,"Jenny Glow. Does a lot of Jo Malone dupes which smell exactly the same and cost peanuts. As a fan of Jo Malone I don't think I will ever go back. So far from Jenny Glow I have sandalwood and rose and they both smell so good, just like the real deal. Also has a lot of my other favorites like Myrrh and Tonka, Wood Sage and Sea Salt and Mimosa and Cardamom. I'm delighted, bit annoyed I didn't find out sooner because I could have saved so much money but definitely better late than never."
59471,best perfume,"Serious, should post this as a sticky/homework that we come back to answer next week."
26771,best board games,"Adding Ticket to ride, Agricola and 7 Wonders to my ""To buy"" list. I will research on others, thanks!

I played 7 wonders yesterday and I found it be fun. I didn't finish last!"
72977,best Linux distro,don't trust everything someone says
39715,best podcast for biologists,I love your podcast. Thank you for making this!
24219,best anime,"I just doubled checked.  5 people explicitly mention both seasons, but they only have a single ""Clannad"" entry on their list.  There are also 2 polls where it just says ""Clannad"", without specifying if they mean the franchise or the first season.  1 person lists it as ""Clannad"" but there's a link to After Story.

I might consider changing it in the next update, but it won't make a big difference.  Either way, the higher-ranked Clannad will be somewhere close to the middle of the top 100.  I guess it's a question of which one will confuse fewer people."
51424,best iphone case,I’m getting the black leather case from Apple
10782,best suitcase lock,"Use a custom clock on the inside, so you know what time it is during packing."
64641,Best Nike running shoes,"I love my Boston's and use them often, but I think they may be a little unforgiving for a new runner's feet...

Brooks Ghosts are the standard first real running shoes recommendation for a reason! Could be a good starting point. New Balance 1080 V10s are nice shoes and forgiving for a new runner...

Personally I love my Nike infinity Reacts."
64352,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,Do you know any alternative to macappstorrent? It was great but it's down. Same as imacapps.
13573,best research paper archive,Bro it’s fine lmao... what’s anyone gonna do
26589,best board games,"The nice thing about legacy is that you can play the base game on the legacy board prior to starting the campaign. Just play a few rounds ( you might want to look up instructions online rather than try to follow the rules from the legacy manual, I’m not sure how confusing it would be otherwise) with the one objective of finding cures to all four diseases. Ignore the trigger of looking through the legacy deck at the second epidemic or whenever the trigger is. Definitely doable."
16231,best sunglasses for fashion,I got a pair of Polarized Dot Dash sunglasses for like 30ish bucks and the build quality is very nice. They aren't name brand but they are solid quality sunglasses for cheap. [https://www.dot-shades.com/](https://www.dot-shades.com/)
19930,best workout music,"Not hip hop, I like listening to electronic/hard style when working out, and most of which are anime/game soundtrack. Some of my favourites:

[COMPLEX - Ken Arai, from Parasyte:The Maxim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ncK3sQV1OQ)

[CHAOS - Æsir, from Cytus II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YV3ic-dyOQ)

This is more hip hop (?):

27974,best breakfast foods,"""Breakfast is the only meal of the day that I tend to view with the same kind of traditionalized reverence that most people associate with Lunch and Dinner. I like to eat breakfast alone, and almost never before noon; anybody with a terminally jangled lifestyle needs at least one psychic anchor every twenty-four hours, and mine is breakfast. In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home — and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed — breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert... Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music… All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.""

- Hunter S. Thompson"
