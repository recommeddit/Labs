10219,best pencil for drawing,"I hear about that and the Blackwing all the time

How much is one"
8446,best toothpaste,"Ah, good old Elmex. I think every German has used it at least once in their life, most probably as a kid. It’s actually really good and even though I’m using a different brand now a lot of my friends still use elmex. The tv commercials always recommended to brush with Aronal in the morning and to use elmex in the evening. No idea what the difference is but lots of people swear by that method."

68360,best science fiction novel,"I liked that series a ton (you can tell by my user name, I bet). Death's End was my favorite, I think. Hard to rank them, but it got so damn interesting by the second half."
45039,best items under $100,"My grandmother would give all the grandkids an electric blanket once they started middle school / Jr high.  Her logic was you weren't going to piss in the bed anymore and electrocute yourself.  I don't think that was really a risk but you weren't going to change her mind. 

I did love my electric blanket in the winter though..."

69637,best major to study in college,"I think its one of those degrees you need to have a plan for. My bachelor's degree was in Behavioral Science (basically psychology).

3201,best webcamera,"It doesn't reset while I'm live at all. It will the next day or if I close OBS and don't start it up for a while. But once I set it up the way I want it, it stays that way until I'm done :)

Funny enough. If I stream through OBS Studio, it resets to auto on its own while I'm live. So I switched back to SLOBS and I haven't had that problem since."

61062,Best comedy show on Netflix,"You hated them?? Ahhh! How? 

I'll give you that the dialogue did get a bit stale after the first few seasons, but not enough to really bother me.  The characters though... Most of them seemed specifically created for their lovability."
