10120,best pencil for drawing,"Any pencil dark enough to make a decent shadow without tearing or deforming the paper you are using. The pencils don't matter. 

I knew a dude in college who reproduced [Rubens's Prometheus Bound](http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/104468.html) with an 8 color Prang watercolor set (the kind you use in elementary school).

Practice."
18368,best YouTube video,"I like the "" ashy negroes"""
1142,best ice cream flavor,Stracciatella! By far. It's absolutely delicious.
55982,best action and adventure movie,Watch the Librarian movies for goofy fun.
64604,Best Nike running shoes,"I tried them on and didn't find them particularly comfortable either. The Asics gel-lite, Saucony high end and Brooks high end all felt better on my feet than the Pegasus."
67980,best science fiction novel,I loved it. I've tried a ton of the newer sci-fi authors and I almost never finish anything. I've read Blindsight several times and always come away impressed. Watts feels a little like a modern-day Frank Herbert to me. Super knowledgeable in a thousand fields but appealing for everyone.
73383,best battery bank,"Ditto to this. I’m not going to be away from a wall outlet for longer than 24h, and with this device, I don’t have to fuss with specifically charging a powerbank."
8771,best toothpaste,I haven’t heard of this rumor and I’ve been a hygienist for 30 years
34397,best NFL player,"Inconsistent? Messi is the most consistently excellent player there ever was. The dude has been the best or 2nd best player in the world every year for the last 9 years, with 50-90 goal seasons where he carries arguably the greatest team of all time. While playing alongside Suarez and Neymar, he still stands out as the key player. He's the Champions League and La Liga record scorer. I could go on and on, this is the easiest point I'll ever make.

>championship game letdowns

8 league titles. 4 Champions Leagues. 11 domestic tournaments. Olympic gold medalist. And several other smaller titles. Whether it's his 91 goal season, on the CL final when he single-handedly dismantled Manchester United, he has been the key to a boatload of titles.

Messi hasn't had the same success with the national team, many accusing him of underperforming... yet he has 56 goals in 114 games, compared to Maradona's 34 in 91. Messi underperforming has done more for Argentina than Maradona ever did. All in an era when Argentina were significantly less dominant on the world stage, with a much weaker squad (compared to the competition)."
25109,best spiderman actor,That movie is going to be so awful.
11832,best gifts for dad,"Get him a Leatherman. It's way more useful than a Swiss army knife, unless he opens wine a lot. I use my Leatherman all of the time. I have the ""wave"" the ""wingman"" is cheaper but also pretty good. They sell them at home depot.

Edit: spelling"
47493,best state to visit in the United States,"Much better 30 years ago for a kid just making a wage and living in an awesome place, but the remains are still something worth searching for."
57571,best cologne,"I’ve worn both for like a decade now, the La Nuit is a warmer and “moodier” version of the standard YSL. I made a mistake last year and got the new “Y” and it’s just not as good as the L’Homme base scent.

Neither is better, they’re just suited to different scenarios. I find I can wear the regular fragrance all the time however with La Nuit more... intimate situations?

Get some samplers. Never buy fragrance based on reddit text descriptions or you end up dropping mad dollar on Aventus, when the best Creed fragrance is actually Green Irish Tweed."
53895,best medicine for a cold,"Tylenol is fucking fantastic for pain relief.

Neocitran is pretty good too."
66480,best soccer team in the world,I can't believe we actually made it but fuck it we'll take it 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
25138,best spiderman actor,I'll take Weenie Hut Jr.'s
48498,best color to paint with,"I was planning on accenting with fabrics like throws and bedding or with artwork, things that are easily changeable."
27487,best bollywood actor,Greatest in India? Greatest in Hindi cinema? Or greatest among Khans?
3489,best college for research,"Sure, I will. Not sure if I should make a separate post lol"
20343,best workout music,Motherfuckin Boneyards!
8964,best toothpaste,"Yeah you could even just use a bar of soap to clean you teeth (or if you want a better tasting product you could use ToothSoap)

I've done it plenty of times when I didn't have toothpaste and I always found that it was more effective than toothpaste."
57513,best water brand,corporation pop
73312,best Linux distro,">Being able to download a lot of apps that are also on windows or at least most of linux apps without compatibility issues.

You're kidding, right?

**Why do you need Linux anyway? What is that you cannot get from Windows 10/11?**

Ubuntu and Mint are very newbie-friendly, and they get updates for many years to come.

You can try all of them with a live USB flash, before installing on an actual device."
10427,best suitcase lock,...I gotta go hunting in Africa.
51847,best iphone case,"No otter? No defender pro? 

Best armor ;)"
