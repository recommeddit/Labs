34397,"Inconsistent? Messi is the most consistently excellent player there ever was. The dude has been the best or 2nd best player in the world every year for the last 9 years, with 50-90 goal seasons where he carries arguably the greatest team of all time. While playing alongside Suarez and Neymar, he still stands out as the key player. He's the Champions League and La Liga record scorer. I could go on and on, this is the easiest point I'll ever make.

>championship game letdowns

8 league titles. 4 Champions Leagues. 11 domestic tournaments. Olympic gold medalist. And several other smaller titles. Whether it's his 91 goal season, on the CL final when he single-handedly dismantled Manchester United, he has been the key to a boatload of titles.

Messi hasn't had the same success with the national team, many accusing him of underperforming... yet he has 56 goals in 114 games, compared to Maradona's 34 in 91. Messi underperforming has done more for Argentina than Maradona ever did. All in an era when Argentina were significantly less dominant on the world stage, with a much weaker squad (compared to the competition).",best NFL player

Neither is better, they’re just suited to different scenarios. I find I can wear the regular fragrance all the time however with La Nuit more... intimate situations?
