3106,"I completely agree and have been thinking the same recently after trying some ""high end"" webcams. They simply aren't good enough.

Consider this: The sensors in the Logitech Brio (which is approx 1/3"") and Dell Ultrasharp webcam (which is 1/2.8"") are still significantly smaller than even the most budget smartphones. (E.g. the main camera on the Samsung galaxy a52 is 1/1.7""!)

I've moved on to DSLR cameras for streaming and the quality difference is huge, but the price is too (Easily 3-6x more expensive than the ""best"" webcams!).

The problem with DSLRs isn't just the cost though. They are large and they are not suited for webcam use. They often requiring dummy batteries, hdmi connections into capture cards and then require manually switching on when you want to use it! Depending on model it might even start to overheat after a while too 

There is definitely a gap in the market for a webcam with something like a 1"" sensor!",best webcamera

28354,"* Steel-cut oats.  Make them ahead of time and keep them in the fridge, so you just have to reheat them in the morning.

* Alternatively, oatmeal if you don't like steel-cut. So many things you can do/add to oatmeal so it isn't like eating the same breakfast every morning.  Along the same lines, you could make cream of wheat too - can add some protein by adding an egg (like [this](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-enriched-cream-of-wheat-79472) recipe)

* breakfast burritos - filled with eggs/beans/whatever produce is on sale that appeals to you

* breakfast muffins - warm up in the microwave

* egg in a hole

* eggs on toast

46831,">CDC recommends that water and soap be preferred over using hand sanitizer by itself.

Care to provide any references for any of that? From the five or so pages on cdc.gov that I read, I didn't find any that backed up your claim that they recommend soap and water **over** hand sanitizer. Of course, you can use both. 

>As for antibacterial soap, from all I've seen, there's little to suggest a significant benefit of it vs regular soap (and vice versa). The fears of resistant strains resulting from their use is overblown, as is the relevance of antibacterial soap's ability to kill more germs.

Depends on the settings. In hospitals it certainly matters, and it probably matters in many peoples daily lives but not to the same extent. 

The article is crap, and the submission headline is crap. Unless you have a bunch of crap on your hands that actually needs to be washed off, soap and water *is not* better than hand sanitizers.",best hand santizer brand

68889,"According to [this blog post](http://file770.com/measuring-the-rabid-puppies-effect-on-the-2017-hugo-ballot/), China Mieville's ""This Census-taker"" was on the 2017 Rabid Puppies slate.  [This one](http://file770.com/measuring-the-rabid-puppies-slates-impact-on-the-final-hugo-ballot/comment-page-3/) shows that Stephenson's SevenEves was on Rabid Puppies 2016.  EDIT: reading more carefully, SevenEves was on the Sad Puppies list as well.

I do think some of the discussion about these books is a bit misleading, because as I understand it (I'd dropped out of SF book reading when the worst of this was going on) part of the Puppy strategy was to include ""hostages"" that were respectable books by authors who'd want nothing to do with the Puppies, in order to make the slates look more respectable than if they just contained the ""genuine"" Puppy works e.g. the stuff associated with VD, BT & co.",best science fiction novel
