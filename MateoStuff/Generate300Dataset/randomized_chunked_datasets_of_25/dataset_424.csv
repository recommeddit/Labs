66666,best soccer team in the world,"I agree, they just lacked a little something this year in CL. It seemed weird to me that you mention them because you said French first league is only exciting to French  people, a fact i'm not that sure about.... but you might be right..."

16227,best sunglasses for fashion,"I was watching steepandcheap.com for a long time, waiting for Smith Wolcott Chromapop+ to go on sale.  They are normally $229, a price I was unwilling to pay.  Then last summer they dropped them to $75.    I stopped buying Oakleys since learning of the Luxottica monopoly.  Smiths are much higher quality."
15146,best tree for the garden,"Thanks! I've found quite a few UK sites discussing the a similar issue. Being in a semi detached house (should have mentioned that in OP), and the neighbouring house being in the shady fence side, I wouldn't want to plant something that would grow monstrous too quickly. Actually, I wouldn't mind, but they might. In an ideal world, I'd like to dig a hole and plonk in something big enough to block the immediate sight lines from the houses behind... but still kind of be cinsiderate to how it will grow. No real big trees in neighbouring gardens. Sizes are about 8x10m perhaps."

44437,best items under $100,Heated blankets are lifesavers.  Our house is over 100 years old and can get drafty.  We had a space heater in our bedroom but the wiring is not great and I noticed the plug was melting(fire hazard!). So I bought a heated blanket with adjustable settings for each side of the bed.   Seriously amazing product

67509,axios alternatives reddit,"This is probably true from the perspective of a low-level HTTP client, but I've tended to find that I usually end up writing a wrapper around fetch that throws these cases as exceptions, because that's the easiest way to deal with them in application code. And if I'm just going to use a homemade wrapper, I figure I may as well use a more solid library that handles these things plus other things by default."
1916,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Yeah I do like that one actually. Good recommendation!
