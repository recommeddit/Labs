28341,"Not really my go-to, but my favourite is the bacon sandwich. It's just astoundingly good and I love it every single time I eat it. And then a wonderful ritual, I use the grease for a slice of fried bread afterwards. 

Typically I'll only do this once per week, though, since it's terrifically bad for you. 

Other comforts are a soft-boiled egg with toast (soldiers!), porridge in the winter, and with every breakfast, coffee. From time to time I just enjoy a platter of assorted bread products as well (crumpets, teacakes, toast with jam or marmalade &c... but instead of choosing just one like I normally would I have them all and make a small mountain).

28339,"A recent favorite is one I stole from Youtube videos of street food in India. I think it's called ""Disco Eggs"" or ""Bread Omelet,"" but in any case, it's delicious.

At face, it's an omelet made with Indian spices. However, the addition of the bread is a genius stroke.  It's a quick breakfast if all your ingredients are already prepped (I've been leaving tupperware with chopped veggies in my fridge and have most of the spices in shakers I bought at Big Lots).The details are a little personalizable, but I've settled on the following:

## Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup diced Onions (I like red)
* 1/4 cup diced Vegetables (tomatoes, bell pepper for me; peas, carrots, and/or green beans would work well, too)
* 1 Green Chili, diced (or to your preferred spice level)
* 1 tbsp chopped Cilantro/Coriander
* Handful of Frozen Spinach *(Optional)*
* 2-3 Pavs (or any buttery yeast rolls, dinner roll sized; Hawaiian makes a great version; Sara Lee, too)

-----
## Spices (use as you prefer)
* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Chat Masala (a tangy-salty spice mix made with sulfur-infused black salt)
* Garam masala (a spicy-sweet spice mix heavy with cinnamon and cloves)
* Red Chili Powder
* Coriander Powder
* Oil

All of the spices amounts are to taste. Start small and work your way up to your preferred taste (I probably use about 1/2 tsp of Salt, 1/4 tsp of black pepper, chat masala, and garam masala, plus about 1/2 tsp of red chili powder and coriander powder).

In a wide, flat pan, heat oil till it's almost smoking over medium-high heat. Add in your onions and fry, stirring, for about 45-60 seconds. Toss in any tough veggies (e.g., carrots, bell pepper) and your diced green chili. Cook another minute, then add in your ""soft"" veggies (e.g., peas, tomatoes, spinach). Cook a further half-minute.

Crack the eggs into the pan and break the yolks, using a spatula to spread the egg over the vegetables in a rough disc shape. Don't worry too much about scrambling unless you just prefer that.

Sprinkle the omelet with salt, pepper, cilantro, and spices that you like (see above for my suggestions). Then, take your rolls and cut them open. Lay them, cut side down, on the omelet, and using your spatula or a [potato masher](http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Oliver-Stainless-Steel-Masher/dp/B0045EPNBI/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1432739120), lightly press the bread into the omelet, flattening the whole thing out somewhat.

After another minute or so while the eggs set, sprinkle the tops of your rolls with additional spices and drizzle lightly with oil. Using a spatula, flip the whole shebang over (if it's too big, you can always break it into pieces) and use the spatula or masher to press the mixture flat again. Let the bread fry on the pan until a little crispy (about 30-60 seconds more), then serve.",best breakfast foods
