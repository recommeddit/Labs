"Exactly, with backups like Costacurta and Crespo. Fucking Juve, Milan should've won so many more scudetti."
Either way this is a solid list. Good shit yo.
Help me choose. Which one is better? Asus K513 or M513? I'm just a casual student and also I'm going to use the laptop mainly for productivity and a little bit of gaming like Left 4 Dead (lol) and then I'm planning to learn editing vids and pictures in Adobe.
"Most hotels will have a monthly rate they don't advertise. You usually won't see this on websites, so it's better to call in advance (if you can), or if you're really ballsy, just find a hotel upon arrival, walk in, and ask if they have a monthly rate.

Maybe it's less common with high-end luxury hotels, but places that are more low to mid range (and seldom fully booked) will usually be pretty happy to cut you a small discount for the extra business.

As an example, one of the places I stayed at in central Vietnam was $10 a night for a very nice double room with an en-suite bathroom. Their discount was 2 free nights for every 10 days booked, so I was able to get a ~$300/mo room for $240."
"Mathematically? Yes. Excel has horrible mathematics. queries aren't particularly hard either. I'm mostly around scientific computing so while it's out of the skillset of most people, it's definitely doable. It's just not done because runtime computations aren't efficient, even Matlab is only for prototyping actual programs are C/Fortran."
That helps too!
"I don't regret what I picked but I would have liked to learn about graphic design, animation, video editing and filming. With that being said, I don't think a degree is needed to learn this so I can do it on my own."
Masturbation
That takes out Japanese Maples for sure.
**I HAVE MICROSCOPIC EELS AND SHIT LIVING MA MOUTH!!!**
"No wobble, but as many have noted, when you click hard/aggro (not that hard really, firmly) it does sound a little on the hollow side. Doesn’t bother me with headphones on, but it’s notable. No wobble as far as I can tell though"
"I actually said grills myself, it is just some dumb meme, but anyway yeah it is a generalization but all I really have to go off is my sister and mom, who are both old and set in their ways. I do admit girls and boys interests seem to mix a lot more with the newest generation. It is a generalization but I don't think you can avoid generalizations while talking about demographics."
"I would pick a column shaped one. It gives you the height, without the headaches of a big ass tree near your house like 'where did the sun go?'. 

Maybe one that flowers?"
Like to celebrate holidays with family. Could drink sometimes. Fun and open to talk guy.
"I'm a millennial but I love president Clinton. I hate that the further left in the party have tarnished him name a bit especially this last cycle. The reforms he got through weren't perfect but were great first steps for gay rights, he was a centrist who tried working with both sides while one side absolutely hated him but he still got a lot accomplished. It's easy to look back and critic or say it wasn't enough but I think considering the climate he did a pretty good job and built a strong coalition for the party to succeed for quite a while."
Teens can drink anything straight.
How do you know how many people Hitler killed by masturbating?
"Top 5 for me would be 

1. The Witcher 3 (My favorite game of ALL time)
2. Bloodborne
3. Dark Souls 3
4. Diablo 3
5. Persona 5"
Good list.
"It doesn't seem like a stretch. Leveling up, choosing different stats to build based on what weapon or armor you want. That brings up the variety of apparal and weapons to be found. A lot of factors make it an RPG."
I like that yello
Keep masterbation to a maximum 10 minutes. No marathon shit.
"Along the same lines is a lesser known teen fantasy series *Pendragon* by D.J. MacHale.  I like it even more than Harry Potter, and it's geared more toward a general audience than just kids.  All 10 books are out now.  I also want to second the Shannara trilogy mentioned above."
"French 75.

1 oz gin, 3 oz champagne, half ounce of simple syrup & half ounce of lemon juice. You can garnish with a lemon twist."
is UCSC really that bad? kinda want to go to the school cause of the foresty vibe/campus lol
