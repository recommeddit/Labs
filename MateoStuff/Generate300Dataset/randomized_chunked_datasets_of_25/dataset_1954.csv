The story goes from an autobiography experiment by the director/writer/initial main character, but takes a sharp turn and literally leads to the recent decision to ban Russian athletes from any and all international sports competitions. They had previously been banned from competing under their flag at the last Olympics, but the scandal has been found to be much worse and the ban is full.",best Netflix documentary

22329,"Met Dave Chappelle a few years back. Long story short, a friend of a friend got me and two friends into an after party. We were sitting at the bar when his manager offered us some shots. We talked with his manager for a while. Then Dave sat down near us. Dave was kind of sitting by himself and he looks over at us and goes “What’s going on fellas?” And we talk to him for about an hour. We thanked him for coming to our town, talked about music, sports, all kinds of stuff. Super cool dude. One of my favorite memories.",best celebrity

23076,"I was flying from California to Haiti to do relief work. I was really broke and had a really shitty flight schedule with lots of long layovers. I was absoloutly exhausted, had't slept properly in 2 days. It was around 4 in the morning when my flight landed in Miami. I was waiting at the terminal for my last flight from Miami to Port Au Prince. All of the seats were taken so I was sitting against a wall. 
This gentleman got up from his seat and walked over to me. I was thinking in my dilirium 'this guy looks like a homeless version of Sean Pennn'. 
Hobo Sean Penn asked me if I would like to have his party's seats so I could lay on something comfortable and get some sleep. I told him 'no thank you, im alright' and he said something along the lines of 'you look exhausted, you really should get some sleep, especially if you are headed to Haiti to do relief work, you will need the rest'. I took him up on the offer, although I felt really selfish about it. I got about 45 minutes worth of sleep that i desperately  needed. 
It turns out it wasn't a hobo that looked like Sean Penn it really was Sean Penn. I had no idea that he had been doing work in Haiti for years. His kindness was really moving, and upon landing and seeing the ravaged landscape of such an impoverished country, I realized that I really needed that sleep.",best celebrity

6022,"**JavaScript.**

You can write your server in it. You can write you website it in. You can write your native app in it.

It's flexible, expressive non-oppressive and there are lots of resources out there for it.

JavaScript frameworks are there to help you organise application logic. They are not essential, in the technical sense, but in the practical sense you'd have a hard time building an app/webapp without them.

In my opinion, start by learning about the two halves separately.

Start with front end, use JQuery because there is almost no learning curve. Have it plug into a REST API and repeat/spit the data on the screen.

Use this for your sample data: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Then use JavaScript on the backend with NodeJS and Express, to recreate the API and point your app to that.

Then use your imagination and drive yourself forward. Try React or Angular for the front end. Try using a database on teh backend. Add some styles, etc.",best programming language for web development

Last year with my XS Max, I tried a clear case and love how it showed  off the phone itself. Unfortunately, they all yellowed.  I’m expected this year to try an Apple clear case which allegedly won’t yellow. We shall see.  Also I like that  Apple’s cases are open on the bottom.

47087,"Thoughts from my three areas of residence:

* Head to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle or Portland) and take in a coffee shop on a rainy day.  The Solstice Parade is the most quintessentially ""Seattle"" event, if you're in town.

* Hit up the midwest during the summer and check out how they do a state fair.  The Minnesota State Fair is pretty amazing.  Deep fry all the things!

* The Southwest is a beautiful place, but full of crazies.  You can come to Phoenix and rent a machine gun.  But then, so can the slightly-off guy sitting next to you.  The main difference between traveling in Arizona and traveling in the third world is most of Arizona has potable water.

45833,"Best: Kit-Kat, hands down. I bought a bag of Reese ""mini-bars"" though, for the kiddies, since I ate the entire bag of Kit-Kat that were intended for them a week ago. *whoops* Basically, Reese's are delicious but not enough for me to go on an impulse binge for. What other candies did I love getting as a kid, though? Hmm, Hershey's (but now I know better--Godiva's are the bee's knees) and Snicker's bars. Starbursts in the red/yellow/pink flavors were great too (*but not orange, fuck those to the fiery pits of hell*) and M & M's too. Skittles is a runner up. I wouldn't mind a roll of gummy Lifesavers. OH and I forgot, Airhead's are WONDERFUL!! So are Almond Joy's, Butterfingers, and Crunch. Twix too, and Rolo's. Willy Wonka candy *in general* are nice, especially the pink Laffy Taffy's.

Worst: Dum-Dum lolly pops (except the raspberry ones, if you give out only those I forgive you) or any other small ones, like Tootsie Pops or just the regular Tootsie's. Smartie's... ughhh. I hated those as a kid, such a disappointment. Twizzlers were OK to eat on a regular sugar kick but as Halloween mini candy? Nooope, lackluster. Bubblegum-type candy just made me cringe... and the solid Lifesavers. I remember hating mint candy... doesn't matter if the aforementioned ""Best"" candies also had a mint variation and if you gave those out... I hate you. Mint is evil. Jolly Ranchers are like Twizzlers to me... if you choose them out for a sugar kick, good, but as a surprise candy in the bag? Disappointing. Dot's are awful and so are the licorice stuff especially those candies that looked like pills--forgot the name. Mike and Ike's and Swedish Fish would of made ten year old me cry.  Milk Dud's are meh... so were Nerd's but those were worse because of the annoying way you had to eat them. Obviously, candy corn......... duh.

And if you give out the kids Pez, you are automatically the worst person on Earth.",best trick or treating candy
