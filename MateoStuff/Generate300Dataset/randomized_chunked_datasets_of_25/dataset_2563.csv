28699,"It's an accident. We buy our toast outright down here, but somewhere in the shipping process they are accidentally made into that shape. Something to do with the fact we're upside down and the magnetic poles being different than in China where they're manufactured... I don't even know, the science is ridiculously advanced. It's even been known to effect some humans who come into contact with the machines, and make their bodies into the same shape. Usually this kills them. A couple have survived, but are in intensive care facilities and won't survive long.
  
The equipment requires a certain calibration, but the Chinese are really reluctant to give it to us like that, and make the things so that we can't tamper with them to correct this issue. It's made people completely go off buying toast, and they actually resort to buying bread and toasters again (fucking disgusting, I know).  
  
There is some conspiracy about the toaster companies making a deal with the Chinese government to induce this dilemma, so that people would continue purchasing their toasters. I personally think it's bullshit, only because the amount of money they'd spend paying off the government would exceed toaster profits.  
  
Some people claim that toasters are being fitted with elaborate devices that spy on the owners, specifically for selling the information to advertising companies. This is just taking it a little bit too far in my opinion. The idea that they'd choose toasters is ridiculous when so many people use Weet-Bix instead of toast anyway.  
  
The only credible counter argument to this is that their technology actually hijacks your wifi, and the toaster is the only common household appliance (if the Australia-shaped toast continues to repulse people) that has the necessary hidden space to hide this device. It's also an appliance that you replace more readily than something like fridges, and the point before about low profits could be rendered void if the companies start releasing innovating (and expensive) toasters, that get many consumers to switch to them.  
  
It's a pretty dark time in Australia. To any Aussies reading this, please let your local MP know about this serious issue and help us fight the toaster companies who will **take away our freedom!**",best breakfast foods

7772,"Looking for a recommendation for a replacement for my water damaged laptop. I had an HP Pavilion that was great until my house flooded and now it’s shot. It was a five year old laptop so probably time to upgrade anyways. 

I’m just a casual user, mainly will be using it for research and work, with occasional streaming. The most demanding activity I’ll be doing with it is working on large, formula laden spreadsheets. Generally, I would say I prioritize durability over light weight/compactness but I also don’t want a brick of a laptop.

I would like to stay under $800 but I can stretch it up to $1200 if it’s REALLY worth the jump for my uses. I saw a Samsung Flex A at Best Buy that looked good and I loved the QLED screen but saw generally mixed reviews on it.
