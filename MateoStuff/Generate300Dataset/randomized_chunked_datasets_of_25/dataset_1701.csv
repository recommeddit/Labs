40195,"Correct answer: 

The i5 10400f/Ryzen 3600 are the current minimum. Just fine for mid range. 

5600x/10600k/11400f/11600k are current beasts. Will be outdated soon due to core count.

I7 10700k/3700x: Previous Gen 8 cores, long term will age gracefully even if performance is less than the latest 6 core parts. 

10850k/10900k: Best ones to buy if you get them around $300-320. Extra two cores is nice for long haul and performance is right behind the 5800x/11700k. 

5800x/11700k: Fine. 8 cores, good enough for a few years. Best gaming CPUs, but only marginally better than the 10850k/10900k and imo not worth losing the two cores. 

11900k: Is this a joke? 

5900x: 12 cores, if you can afford it definitely a nice value.

5950x: Wtf overkill alert but hey you got the cash buy it.

Not mentioned: i7 10700(f), 10900(f), 11700(f)/11900(f). Why the hell would you buy a cpu that expensive without overclocking? No just no.",best midrange CPU

33656,"Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the new Rivian and Tesla trucks? I own an F150, and will drive it until it dies, but some of these new electric trucks are pretty enticing as the replacement. An individual motor with instant torque for each wheel is pretty cool for off roading situations",best electric car

73490,"Makes perfect sense to me, if you remember that for some Ultralight = Ultra efficient.  It's about being able to spend more time on trail.  If you want to walk all day, everyday, (or if your hiking style is camera heavy, or you're on a tight budget) there's a sense of freedom that comes with not having to concern yourself about battery status.   

2 20k mAh powerbanks still sounds ridiculous though.",best battery bank

32493,"I'm here in Cabo right now at the Riu Palace. wifi is good in the rooms and lobby. spotty elsewhere. it's located just outside of town. the beach looks nice but it's too strong of a current to go into. also the sand is coarse and hard to walk barefoot. 

the resort is all inclusive so all you can eat food and drinks. the buffet is good for buffet quality. first night we had hand carved Serrano ham and prime rib. The San Jose restaurant onsite had an amazing balcony for lunch or early dinner. I've been eating lots of ceviche and paella. my drawback is... I want authentic street tacos!

the resort seems pretty chill at night so to look for more of an uptempo scene you'll have to venture into town. PM your questions and I can try to answer you",best vacation resort
