I could not even use Windscribe VPN service since bandwidth was very low. I asked for refund but they didnt refund it.

Bandwidth while using ProtonVPN is very high. I didn't have any trouble while using ProtonVPN (Basic). Software provided to use their service is also very decent compared to Windscribe.",best vpn for torrenting reddit

38608,"ToI, Hindu, Deccan in office I scan them for 10-20 mins when I reach office. Then sometime after lunch I focus on those pages with some masala or interesting news or column that I might have found during first scan. It's mostly Hindu though. ToI is tabloid anyway.

Other than that I subscribe to Outlook  and finish it mostly. Now that Newsweek is restarting print, I will again have its annual sub. Newsweek was the best news magazine I've come across.

> Have returned to India after a gap of 3-4 years and realized that a lot of newspapers are now crap

Can you name some that you didn't find crap 3-4 years ago but you find them crap now? I think Hindu has deteriorated but ToI, IE were already shitty. 

By the way I used to like Telegraph when I was in Jharkhand.

**Edit:** One of my friends in Chennai told me that one can get Hindu print edition for something like 6 months costing only 70-80 INR. Any city (I am from B'lore). He didn't tell me how. Said somewhere online - he is from Civil Engg.

How come? Does anyone know how to get that subscription? Or I was just trolled offline? Any idea?",best newspapers to read

34076,">hutson would get owned in modern day football.

Sure, if you magically transported him to the present day and disallowed him any benefits of using modern training techniques, nutritional science, and equipment. And how would Rice have played without all those things listed above? With a leather helmet and fewer pads. Without the West Coast Offense? With a quarterback completing 40% of his passes?

Since we can't know exactly how that would affect him or his game, it seems a silly hypothetical to me. We can really only evaluate players relative to their peers, and no player was more dominant relative to his contemporaries than was Hutson. That alone puts him in the conversation.
