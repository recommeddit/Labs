34546,best NFL player,Wow no respect for Jim Thorpe
51864,best iphone case,"Which Otterbox would you recommend? I’m thinking between Commutter and Symmetry, or even back to Defender again."
71551,best movies with a cool twist,"I mean, isn't that original line... Also kinda true?"
30481,best Mexican war to study,"Favourite war: Invasion of Britain by the Romans, but there isn't that much information on it

Ergo, most interesting war to read about: [Caesar's Gallic Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars).  In his own words, detailed about the action but also the tribes he encountered.  Fascinating.  The following [Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Civili) is also very interesting."
4665,best home improvement store,"Here they both have a pretty good selection of pine lumber, but have pretty much nothing for harder woods.  Menards, on the other hand, has some selection of walnut and oak, but oh my god, trying to find some normal old 2x12s or something is impossible."
59140,best perfume,That was my favorite in high school! It was the first perfume I ever loved:)
18386,best YouTube video,At least I have chicken!
71859,best movies with a cool twist,"I don't see how that implies it directly. ""Dark Father"" was just a coincidence I think. 'Vader' was just a word used on it's own."
56424,best desktop monitor,"I'm happy with Samsung CHG70 (1440p curved VA). The blacks are really deep. Since I had never used a VA panel monitor before I was impressed with the deep blacks. It feels more responsive than my old  IPS Asus VP249QGR and at least to me it doesn't feel like the colors are any worse. I don't get what black smearing is all about, I hope I never learn it \^\^"
61141,Best comedy show on Netflix,"It's not on the US one so you would have to change your region to Canada but Veronica Mars matches your description.

Firefly is smartly written and has great dialogue (when it comes to that any Joss Whedon show tbh) and Gilmore girls also has really clever and witty dialogue"
1922,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Hey I just moved back from SF! Yup Tony’s and golden boy are amazing and unmatched! Wanna be friends?
62040,Best RPG game on PS4,"Kind of throwing it out there but I didn't see it mentioned: Monster Hunter World.

It took me a while to learn the basics but it's now one of the few games I've played for over 100 hours."
34676,best NFL player,Both lists have too many qbs
8503,best toothpaste,Better question Dentists of Reddit what toothpaste is in your bathroom right now?
36288,best alcoholic drink,Didn't expect the (current) top answer to be one I agree with.  Yay.
25699,best cricket teams of all time,"Looking through the WI team, and I can't argue with the selections, but you look at those who missed out - the 3 W's (Everton Weekes, Clyde Walcott, Frank Worrall), Wes Hall, Courtney Walsh, Richie Richardson, Gerry Alexander - a match between the second XI's would be an absolute cracker as well."
10119,best pencil for drawing,"Shit son, I had a whole thing typed up about lead holders and pointers; now no need. The only thing I would add about my own personal process is that I like doing all my preliminary sketches and studies on tracing paper, that way you can easily transfer or rearrange elements depending on how you want your final composition to come out. Oh and speaking of transfers, the fine lead powder created by the lead pointer is ideal for doing graphite transfers onto illustration board or canvas or shatever."
9487,best toothpaste,Upvoted for solid information.
31709,best hotel to live in,That movie made me sad.
28695,best breakfast foods,"Australia:

18373,best YouTube video,"That was my first time watching that, how did the school get away with that? Haha"
20796,best workout music,[This version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM) of My Heart Will Go On.
19681,best YouTube video,***TASTE THE SUN***
22948,best celebrity,This really makes me happy.
18382,best YouTube video,"He unfollowed me. Like the man, the myth, the LEGEND saw one of my tweets on his timeline and decided I was too annoying to keep following. Absolute legend"
