Ergo, most interesting war to read about: [Caesar's Gallic Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars).  In his own words, detailed about the action but also the tribes he encountered.  Fascinating.  The following [Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Civili) is also very interesting.",best Mexican war to study

10119,"Shit son, I had a whole thing typed up about lead holders and pointers; now no need. The only thing I would add about my own personal process is that I like doing all my preliminary sketches and studies on tracing paper, that way you can easily transfer or rearrange elements depending on how you want your final composition to come out.
