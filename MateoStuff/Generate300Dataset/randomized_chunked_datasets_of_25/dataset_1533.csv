38123,best Marvel movie,"The best ones IMO are Iron Man 1, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 and 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Spiderman: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.

My real opinion is just watch them all. Treat it like a TV show if you need to and do an hour at a time. Watching them all is the one true Marvel experience.

Except Hulk, like /u/ThoroughHenry said. Hulk sucks, it doesn't feel like part of the franchise, and Edward Norton was recast anyway.

Edit: Add Black Panther, which I can't believe I forgot. That's a real good blankie movie. Set designs and costumes are AMAZING, as is Michael B. Jordan's performance."

55230,best places to hike in the east coast,"A great place to be. 

Even hiking in Vancouver I find myself comparing it here to the park. 

And I come to the same conclusion... 

The mountains here are young punks, striving to be as bad ass and awesome as their great grandparents, the Adirondacks."

8301,best toothpaste,"I also use an inexpensive Oral B. It works great, my only complaint is there are these grip ridges on it that are quite annoying to clean."
7410,best laptop for general use,"In that case, you could consider the [**Lenovo Yoga 7i 15"" 2-in-1**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/b3m49B) instead, the $977.49 configuration with 12 GB RAM."
45115,best items under $100,"My hammock.

I spent so many spring days and summer mornings curled up outside in it, reading a book, and just reveling in the outdoors. (It helps that I have a view to a state park from my yard, but I digress).

I still try to sit out there now with a healthy amount of blankets, but it looks like the ""hammock season"" is officially coming to an end :-( Still hands down my favorite purchase of 2017 though."
44908,best items under $100,"Dope. Funny enough an Amazon package of two electric toothbrushes ended up on my doorstep and no one ever ordered them. Addressed to my address but not my name. I read that it's a scam to get confirmed orders and possible reviews or whatever but regardless, I love my free toothbrush. Also in that package were hair curler things that stylists use when doing perms. It was a pretty random but cool surprise."
69757,best major to study in college,If you don't like shit ton of physics or if you're not atleast somewhat good in it don't go into lucrative engineering fields because there's a very high chance you will switch out. If you're in it only for the money there's a big wake up call heading for you

4127,best online college,"I think they are unfairly looked down upon. Depending on the class though I can see how there would be an advantage to have face to face classes vs online courses but that's another topic.

I think online courses are godsends for some people. It allows the student to work on their time schedule while still holding down a job and manage their personal life. It's hard to balance a job, a child, and school enough already. Online classes allow a more even balance for that individual.

I also know some older people that wouldn't go back to school for they feel it's too embarrassing to be a 40 year old in school again. 

One should never be embarrassed to take online classes and they shouldn't have to suffer afterwards for making the decision to get further education, no matter the source (as long as it's reputable of course)"
