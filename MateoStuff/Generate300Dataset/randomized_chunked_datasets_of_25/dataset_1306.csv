For those who wont watch the video, a couple years ago, the verge released this video on how to build a pc. It is the best example of how NOT to build a PC. They've deleted their video now, since there was a lot of mockery.

6899,best iPhone,"They sort of put themselves in that position. Half of the reason it supported iOS 9 was because the device was still sold in developing countries the year prior.  At the time they were proud of supporting their phones for at least two years from the shelf. Now because the processors are so much more powerful they don’t have a problem with that, but it played a large role in why it received the support"

34140,best NFL player,"Most dominant player in their era? Don Hutson

Most complete/versatile player? Many would probably say Walter Payton, although I think Sammy Baugh was better who actually played in all 3 phases throughout his career.

Best athlete? Probably Randy Moss, but that doesn't mean it always translated on the field.

I'm going with Sammy Baugh. There was also the season where he led the league in passing, punting and interceptions in the same season."
