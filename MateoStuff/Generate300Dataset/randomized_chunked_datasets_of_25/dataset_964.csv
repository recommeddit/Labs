41079,best instrument to play,"Nothing beats a piano for ease and playability. You never need to think about how to actually make a note sound. You hit the key and it sounds. Even with easier fretted instruments, sometimes your finger is in the wrong place and you don't get a sound."
13880,best research paper archive,"Ronald Coase's ""The Problem of Social Cost"" is widely considered one of the most important social science papers ever written.  It deals with the economics topic of ""externalities.""  It has been massively cited in the social science literature and does not require advanced mathematical, legal or economics knowledge to understand (Coase was a lawyer turned economist).  

Interestingly, readers of ""The Problem of Social Cost"" seem to reach quite different conclusions about what what the paper means, with widely differing papers citing it in support of their conclusions.

Coase is considered to have earned his Nobel with this paper and his other classic ""The Nature of the Firm"" (about transactions costs). The papers are available on JSTOR and there are pdf copies around on the web (whose legal availability I cannot speak to)."
