56422,best desktop monitor,I got the LG 27gn850 rival to the Dell s2721 same iOS panel and got an excellent deal at Best Buy. Says $499 online and paid $369
16690,best pet for toddlers,"The only time I've ever seen someone get bit by my gerbil is when they were stressing him out by pinning him down. Also, male gerbils are nicer than females."
7237,best iPhone,"I bought a XR brand new on mid January this year and I must say I don’t regret a single thing. I’m
not much of a photographer so the single camera on the XR is perfect for me for the occasional picture. The battery lasts all day and it’s very fast. When I compare it to my dads 11 I can’t find a big difference in terms of speed and screen quality.

I also upgraded from an iPhone 7 and the difference is huge. I was gonna get the SE but decided to go for the XR instead to feel a bigger change and get that extra battery. For $500, this phone is insane value and should last for at least 3 years more."

27210,best stocks to buy,Some Redditor’s 10 year investment strategy change ￼from week to week
62720,Best Data Science textbook,"If you're using Python, Applied Predictive Modeling with scikit-learn and TensorFlow is a very similar book."
59319,best perfume,"Yes! 

I first smelled it on a waitress I was working with over 10 years ago and was so surprised when she said what it was. Its been my go-to ever since! 

I get compliments every time I wear it!"
39528,best podcast for biologists,"Saw bones is a comedy show about medical history. Not super deep content learning, as a biologist, I enjoy it."
33295,best electric car,"A 50% of preorders turning into actual sales would be monster and great. I’m not saying I’ll be able to walk away with one on launch day, but I spoke to the Ford dealer today and they said they expect to get some no matter what. 

That said, I already preordered it awhile ago. No idea where I am in the queue but obviously not too late to back out, which is why I’m asking this question."
58098,best cologne,Similar thing is exactly what made me add that last sentence. One woman immediately said one of the samples said it smelled like her uncle.
51449,best iphone case,"I’ve had their silicone ones as well. The silicone is good, it will lose its softness after a while. I haven’t had any issues with it peeling, but I also never drop my phone. My wife has had her silicone cases start to peel after dropping her phone and nicking the case a bit. 

They are harder to get in and out of the pocket (why I like leather), but with Covid I’m not really going anywhere that often so I don’t mind. They are really nice for sweat pants / gym shorts though because I don’t have to worry as much."
5682,best programming language for web development,"Yeah I use Skype, that's it.

No portfolio site. Although once I'm done with my current jobs I'll probably set one up. 

I've gotten the jobs that I have by writing honest proposals. If I haven't used a framework before, or if I don't have much experience in something, I let them know. I just try to convey that I'm ambitious and will put in any amount of work that it takes to learn what they need me to know. Be confident that you can learn anything.

A lot of employers aren't looking for the best programmer in the world. They are looking for someone they can communicate with, that will put in the effort and time required to get the job done. Sometimes enthusiasm > experience. Good scores on the elance/odesk tests help as well.

Again, maybe I got lucky and after these jobs I'll be fucked. Who knows, I just started this. But having no money is a great motivator so I'm sure I'll figure it out."
49115,best gaming monitor,I'm in the same boat. I have kinda settled on the xg270qg and was hoping for more reviews than the one in here. I do want to see reviews g7 before I go in on xg270qg
34613,best NFL player,"> I hate how people downplay other positions greatness because qbs are more integral to the team.

Really doesn't feel like anybody is downplaying it at all. Ultimately, on a list when deciding between #1 and #2 who are arguably equally great at what they do, if one (either by virtue of position value or anything else) is better at winning football games, that's a pretty good arbitration metric."
60260,best freezer brand,"Definitely recommend the stand-up variety. We had a chest freezer and got rid of it because it was full but I never knew what was in it and getting to anything was always a pain in the behind. 

Enter upright freezer and I'm a happy camper.  Labeled and easy to access means that we use it effectively and nothing gets wasted."

20021,best workout music,"Meh. They missed A LOT.

Their list is about 30 good songs and 70 *shrugs*."
72371,best keyboard switches,"Look, I don't disagree with you, but it's a flowchart.  They're both clicky and stiff.  This was the most practical format I could come up with.  If you have a good suggestion for a flowchart format that incorporates any necessary changes, I'm all ears."
45444,best gaming system,Joycon Drift. Also going from PC to that would be brutal.
41680,movies like Inception,"Good Cronenberg flick.  Maybe Videodrome, too?"
11026,best backpack for college,"I used mine for the last two years of college and it was great. Comfortable straps, nice padded felt-lined laptop slot, durable and stylish."
52377,best hiphop album,"Lmao dude I don't like Fantano or listen to the alternative shit you're talking about. I listen to east coast boom bap revival like Griselda, Crimeapple, Roc Marciano, etc. I admittedly don't listen to classic albums most of the time, but that's my fault because I do that with every genre I listen to, just skip over the required shit for whatever reason."
30246,best Mexican war to study,"This is how I was taught

Basically Polk saw Texas leave Mexico and decided he could get a lot more land if he wanted, so he started a war with Mexico. Tennessee was like “fuck yeah” because they still remembered the Alamo (they were asked to provide 3,000 volunteers for the war and 30,000 showed up). So we went to Mexico and beat the shit out of them

And no offense, but honor doesn’t win wars. It was a war, and we fought to win. The fact we outclassed you doesn’t change that"
13677,best research paper archive,Interesting!
55687,best action and adventure novel series,"Jeff Somers's [Avery Cates](http://www.avery-cates.com/) series is pretty much nothing but bubble-gum, summer-time styled dystopian sci-fi action with tons of explosions, blood, and a smart-ass anti-hero who always manages to get up one more time to finish the fight and somehow live.  Seriously, there is no real depth of story or character here, just action and plot.  If books are food for the brain then this is straight up junk food."
