7237,"I bought a XR brand new on mid January this year and I must say I don’t regret a single thing. I’m
not much of a photographer so the single camera on the XR is perfect for me for the occasional picture. The battery lasts all day and it’s very fast. When I compare it to my dads 11 I can’t find a big difference in terms of speed and screen quality.

I also upgraded from an iPhone 7 and the difference is huge. I was gonna get the SE but decided to go for the XR instead to feel a bigger change and get that extra battery. For $500, this phone is insane value and should last for at least 3 years more.",best iPhone

They are harder to get in and out of the pocket (why I like leather), but with Covid I’m not really going anywhere that often so I don’t mind. They are really nice for sweat pants / gym shorts though because I don’t have to worry as much.",best iphone case

No portfolio site. Although once I'm done with my current jobs I'll probably set one up. 

I've gotten the jobs that I have by writing honest proposals. If I haven't used a framework before, or if I don't have much experience in something, I let them know. I just try to convey that I'm ambitious and will put in any amount of work that it takes to learn what they need me to know. Be confident that you can learn anything.

A lot of employers aren't looking for the best programmer in the world. They are looking for someone they can communicate with, that will put in the effort and time required to get the job done. Sometimes enthusiasm > experience. Good scores on the elance/odesk tests help as well.

Again, maybe I got lucky and after these jobs I'll be fucked. Who knows, I just started this. But having no money is a great motivator so I'm sure I'll figure it out.",best programming language for web development

34613,"> I hate how people downplay other positions greatness because qbs are more integral to the team.

Really doesn't feel like anybody is downplaying it at all. Ultimately, on a list when deciding between #1 and #2 who are arguably equally great at what they do, if one (either by virtue of position value or anything else) is better at winning football games, that's a pretty good arbitration metric.",best NFL player

Basically Polk saw Texas leave Mexico and decided he could get a lot more land if he wanted, so he started a war with Mexico. Tennessee was like “fuck yeah” because they still remembered the Alamo (they were asked to provide 3,000 volunteers for the war and 30,000 showed up). So we went to Mexico and beat the shit out of them
