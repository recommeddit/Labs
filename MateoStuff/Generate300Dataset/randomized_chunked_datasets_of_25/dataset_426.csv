4949,best home improvement store,"I used Home Depot, Lowes, HD Supply, Build.com, Ashley furniture, Costco, Ace Hardware, Walmart, Target, and Macy's. 

Build.com has excellent phone support. I got my two chandeliers, and all my cabinets handles and pulls there with free shipping.

Macy's has a wonderful furniture sale annually. 

Good luck."

48325,best color to paint with,I agree with your statement.  I can’t think of the name of the white I used right now but it has a hint of pink and I think is much better than if I painted the walls the same ultra pure white as the ceilings

29995,best money managing app,"Paying for a budget app only has a defeated purpose if you don’t get the value out of it. In my first year of YNAB I literally got several thousand dollars of value out of it. 

Also, YNAB has a free 34 day trial and 1 year trial if you’re a student. Well worth the cost though. It’s now part of my budget to pay for YNAB."

We had it at Penn State in the vending machines. It got sold to Nestle over a decade ago and no longer exists. 

The well water from my parents house, when you'd let it run cold for a good minute first, or over ice made from the same water. Also no longer possible, a huge development was put in and it ruined the water shed, everyone had to covert to city water from well water."

69774,best major to study in college,"~~STEM~~ TEM fields and computer science are good bets now

Physical science fields do not pay well.  And certainly do not pay well compared to engineering, technology, and often math (though math is a risk itself).

Chemistry, biology, biochemistry, physics, microbiology, etc. salaries are trash.  Examples of well paying jobs in those fields are highly anecdotal and do not take into account the hundreds of people that wanted that job and did not get it."

The marimba, hands down, it's so beautiful especially when you play it in a closed space (like a small room) so the sound can bounce off the walls. The whole experience is quite orgasmic. It would be even better accompanied with a violin or cello, oh god it would be the most beautiful thing to be experienced."
