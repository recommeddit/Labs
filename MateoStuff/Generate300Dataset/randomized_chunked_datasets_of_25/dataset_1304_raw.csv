Saw that you haven't played The Witcher 3. Definitely going to be your best bet for a good RPG. Although there's plenty of others out there. AC: Odyssey is enjoyable. Story is a bit lackluster but the gameplay was right there.
Artisan is just higher quality. You won't find another pad with lower stitching and the rubber base sucks itself to your desk. But these are comfort things. If you're not into spending extra for a premium experience then you shouldn't get an Artisan.
I was afraid of that...
My brain will not read that word as anything other than lactose.

"I have an elementary education degree from Phoenix. I got a long term subbing job before I even graduated and am now teaching full time (got this job five months after I graduated, once hiring for this school year began). 

That being said, I did three years of my schooling at a private Christian university in my home state. I went to UoP because I was freshly married to a man in the military and we had to move and I had no idea "" real schools"" had online programs. I hated UoP and I worried I wouldn't get a job. Luckily people can tell I'm not a dipshit. Networking is also important."
"So hearty is a good thing. Try this out.

1 onion of choice
1 can of hominy
1 package of bacon or a log of sausage

Brown meat, then throw in coarsely chopped onion. Salt and pepper to taste. Drain hominy, then add to Tue mix. Let hominy brown slightly. Spend the next couple hours completely stuffed. :)"

"I never would have considered Rebecca a romance when I read it, though it's been some time. The semantics of it's classification aside, I agree that it's a great mystery and psychological thriller."
To be fair if you got to Novigrad in TW3 you probably did all the best quests already. There's still some great content after that (I enjoyed a lot of Skellige) but nothing (until maybe the DLC) really livesup to those first few quest lines in the South.

"Majored in Accounting, worked a bit, and then went and got a masters in a specific field of I.E. (Supply Chain Engineering). 

Accounting/Finance + Supply Chain skills landed me a $180k job at 30. 

No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune)."

"In our case I'd go with the piano, but I suggest getting a teacher (this also goes for most other instruments) you dont have to go every week for x years but it's important to get the basics right (to prevent injury and getting better). With piano you can play practically everything (especially if later on you invest in a Synthesizer) and it's the easiest instrument to learn musictheory."
A good set of teeth for constant smiling and the ability to lie relentlessly without feeling remorse. Also you need to deliver speeches in a way that it seems you might be taking both sides of a debate without ever deliberately stating what you think. Ride that fence.

"XB1 feels like ""PC Lite.""

PS4 or Switch for ""the console experience.""

Switch is more kiddie but some people like that.

PS4 is more serious/adult ""console experience.""

So my vote is PS4."

Yes! I love his videos they are really funny and interesting.
