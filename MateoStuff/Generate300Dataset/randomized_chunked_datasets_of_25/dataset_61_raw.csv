Approximately 2/3 of a shit.
Tbh Iâ€™m still surprised myself that [Installer 5 finally happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/c8vbjl/news_installer_5_beta_released/)
What.? She's super tall in all her movies..
Always relevant
"Nope, not a single one. I think there are maybe 2 houses in my entire neighborhood that have decorations up."
It's good. I probably should have explained a little better what I meant.
You make good points. I think we need a map with at least 10x higher resolution. My problem is that it's too cluttered.

I would recommend a charging case tell me what model you have and I can tell you what kind I think will work best with it. I just got a new iPhone and always have used battery cases. Not only are they thin but they last long and use lighting connections for charge and display output.
"*Hello. You have a collect call from* ^""John ^Cena"". *Will you accept the charges?*"
A threesome
"Singapore is a great country to live in - but the consistency may end up boring you.

No-one talks about the weather - because it is the same every day.  Tomorrow will be 31 or 32C and you will probably get a thunderstorm late afternoon.

The difference between the longest day (mid-Summer) and the shortest day (mid-Winter) is only 8 minutes - so the sun always comes up about 7am and goes down about 7pm.

Some things are horribly expensive - real estate, cars, petrol, some food, booze.

Some things are ridiculously cheap - Some food, Taxis, MRT (Subway trains), Internet (and it is fast), cable TV, massages..."
I guess Tom's of Maine doesn't give free samples.
"Tom Fords are great. A good selection of classic styles, as well as some more modern takes."
"A useful introductory book is Data Science by Kelleher and Tireney. [http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-science](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-science)

I say useful because it is a high level survey of the Data Science landscape and capabilities and good for business managers to get an understanding of what the technologies are capable of providing to the business. Also useful when somebody asks you to explain data science to them ""in five minutes"". After a quick overview you can refer them to this book. If they get it and read it you can have a meaningful conversation and if they dont they were likely never really interested in the first place and they will probably no longer waste your time!!!"
"Same. Had to go back to Event Flow Widget to get a widget that was similar looking to Today Calendar's agenda view. 

I recall the dev was working on a successor to Today Calendar and I even had the alpha installed  for a while, but I haven't seen any updates to it in forever."
You're partying with the wrong people.
"As a proud raimimemer, Tobey all the way.

Why? Cheesy, Superhero nostalgia.

Superhero movies are mostly way too serious now than the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy ever was. And that's fine when the story requires it, but a superhero movie is basically us suspending disbelief in order to enjoy this two hour feature, so no one would really mind if some things were over the top.

It's why Shazam is good too. I really enjoyed it."

"Is it just me, or is it a little unsettling to leave food heating in an appliance all day when you're not there to keep an eye on it?"
"America is definitely not the best.  we are number one in military budget and that's essentially it.  As I live here and have only visited two other countries (Canada and Mexico) I don't think I have the authority to say which is the best to live in, as I have not lived anywhere else, but... I will say from the places I have been, Vancouver, Canada seems like it would be the best to live in."
"It is a pretty large improvement, so it is definitely worth paying $200 more for."
I use Berkey it works great
