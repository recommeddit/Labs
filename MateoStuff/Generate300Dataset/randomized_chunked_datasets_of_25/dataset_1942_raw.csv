"Definitely get all your appliances from Sears and Sears Outlet stores. You can save a ton of money buying scratch and dent stuff, plus a lot of the stuff will come with factory warranties.

As far as Home Depot vs. Lowe's I go to Lowe's because the CEO of Home Depot is a huge douchebag. The CEO of Lowe's might also be a douchebag, I don't know, but I know for a fact the Home Depot guy is a sexist, bigot, etc."

Twin Peaks. Itâ€™s a cult classic. Itâ€™s very unique so donâ€™t expect it to be like anything else youâ€™ve seen.
Thank you for the suggestion!
"Best: SE (1. Gen)
Worst: 7

The SE had that beautifully industrial, angled, premium feeling glass and aluminium design with the perfect sized chassis. 

The 7 on the other hand is too big and the chassis has a boring rounded design and cheap feeling plastic on the outside. Also itâ€™s missing an actual tactile home button and a headphone jack. Basically the same criticism can be applied to all generations that came afterwards. 

I donâ€™t really care about the processor specs and so on since I donâ€™t use my phone to play games and such. I just want an iPhone that COMFORTABLY fits into my pants pockets."

"You, the recipient, lose something this way though. Imagine that you wanted something expensive for your birthday...something that you wouldn't normally purchase for yourself because it was so expensive. Now, picture someone buying it for you (or several people going in together) and you get it...super exciting...you have this thing that you would have NEVER purchased.

Now, picture those same people going in together and giving you the money to buy it yourself. Economists have found that the person who received the cash is actually LESS LIKELY to purchase the item the cash was intended for...because once they have the cash in hand they rationally don't want to spend that much on something (just like before...when you wouldn't want to buy it yourself)...you want to pay your bills or something else.

Cash is awesome...don't get me wrong. But there is a benefit to an actual gift."
