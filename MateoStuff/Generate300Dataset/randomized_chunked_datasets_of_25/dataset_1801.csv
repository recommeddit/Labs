67754,"I agree that the article is more subjective than it should be. For those who would want more details :

> What if I want to get the HTTP headers, cookies, redirect information or read the status code? The response object has valuable information. This should be explicit asked for.

Actually the response object has all you need, for example response.headers, response.request... only response.data is automatically transformed if your responseType is set to json, which is the default. So simply changing the responseType should be enough to get the raw response.

> What is the [XSRF protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)? How does it work ""being better""? Doesn't this need support on the server side?

Some frameworks ask for token to authenticate specific requests, and you can set Axios to store this in a cookie which will be automatically sent as a HTTP header (both cookie name and header name are configurable). This is actually pretty sweet since once configured on both sides, you really forget about it.

> The implicited automatic error handling isn't usefull perse. With REST non-200-ok status codes might mean something for your app. This should also be asked for explicitly.

There's an option to change that quite easily, that should have been mentioned in the article :

    validateStatus: function (status) {
        return status >= 200 && status < 300; // default
      },

> Globally defined interceptors are bad. Globals are bad. Just chain a transform function into your promise chain or create a wrapper function.

You can define interceptors per instance, I'm not a fan of the global axios instance and prefer to create one for each component I have via axios.create. Interceptors are super nice because they can live really before your response handling code : I was able to change my whole app from JSON to msgpack for the sake of it by just changing the Accept/Content-Type header and POST data and decoding the response in an interceptor (all in transformRequest, server-side serialization depends on Accept header). This is done in my constructor function returning each instances, so all my custom in-components code was untouched and didn't need any changes !",axios alternatives reddit

VA does ghost, but at 60hz it's not noticeable unless you drag black frames on white background. In games I don't notice it. Can't say anything about 144hz though.

I also have a smaller TN 144hz monitor, that one is worst to be fair. Viewing angles and darks suck badly.",best gaming monitor
