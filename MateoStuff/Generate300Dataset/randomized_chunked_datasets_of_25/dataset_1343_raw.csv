"I always wondered about ranked list scoring, if there was a better way to assign a score. For example, in Formula 1, instead of ranks 1-10 getting 10-1 points respectively, first place gets 25, second gets 18, third gets 15, down to 10th getting 1 point. I have no idea if one way is better than any other, though, or how easy/effective it would be to extrapolate this from a 10-item ranking to 100 items."
"Be careful when studying music. Most universities offer Music Performance and Music Education. Getting a bacehlor's in Music Education means you're certified to teach at a school, and therefore has more potential of getting you a job. Music Performance just means you got really good at playing your instrument. You still have job options, such as giving lessons, starting your own studio, joining a professional symphony, or just being a freelance musician. But those all have varying levels of difficulty and instability. For example, to get into a symphony, you have to be the best of the best (at least for top-tier symphonies). So your probability of being hired depends solely on your audition. And to be a freelance musician means that there may be periods where you're unemployed. And even when you are hired by someone, you will go most of the time without insurance or a retirement fund. 

And then you have to factor in the location you're in. If you're in an area that's musically dry, you won't be finding any paying gigs unless you're a teacher. There may be plenty of people wanting your services, like churches, community bands, and musical pit orchestras, but you probably won't get paid."

"I sometimes read the Telegraph when it's lying around, and recently it seems to have moved from an intelligent and principled (if misguided) right-wing ideology to a rather unpleasant diatribe reminiscent of US right-wing politics.  While it's not really a newspaper, for people interested in news analysis from a right-wing perspective, I would recommend The Economist.

The Guardian is often described as left-wing, but it's really much closer to centrist/liberal.  It projects a curious kind of ""feel-good"" morality for people who like to be outraged about things and believe the way to save humanity is to buy organic food and install solar panels on their houses.  It very rarely takes a controversial opinion on anything, and it refuses to engage with the radical left.  For left-wing news and opinion, I would recommend the [Morning Star](http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/) (the newspaper of the Communist Party of Britain) or the [New Statesman](http://www.newstatesman.com/), a weekly magazine associated with the Fabian Society.

And everyone, regardless of their political ideology, should read Private Eye, since it tells you which things you just read in the newspapers aren't actually true."

">  because you NEED minerals in order to live. 

God forbid I ever eat or drink anything, other than pure water.

> at this point, we don't have enough knowledge to say that drinking acidic water every day is going to kill you faster vs a ph neutral water.

No, there's a lot of evidence that says acidic substances are worse for than neutral substances. Shit, what was that called? Oh yeah, chemistry.

> and the same goes for drinking water that has higher ppm of this or that.

Well, so far we've only talked about fluoride. What about everything else? Please provide a complete and absolute list of what is in [bottled drinking water brand of your choice]. Your next challenge is to write a paper about why bad things are bad for you **WHILE CLIMBING THE AGGRO CRAG!!!**

> with your mindset, you probably shouldn't even be drinking coffee.

See, now you're just jumping to asinine conclusions because you can't comprehend that tap water is better than bottled water in most cases.

> because some research somewhere has shown drinking coffee is bad.

What about all the research that has shown drinking coffee is good? Oh! Oh! Remember when they used to say that cigarettes were good for you?

> just like i'm sure you've seen some research somewhere that says a higher ppm of this or that is bad for you, which has got you all tangled up in a rut.

No, it's pretty clear that higher percentages of harmful things are worse for you than lower percentages or none at all.

You know, I really wish there was a class where they could teach common sense, because you're in need of it, and you would probably need to retake it three or four times.

Look, I can see that you're a very uneducated, bland, ""man's"" man, with little to no common sense or critical thinking skills. You're not a student. You probably have a very specific job where you only do one thing, or you're a basic, run-of-the-mill pencil pusher. You're easily replaceable. You make a decent salary, but are ultimately a slave to your job, because you still pay rent. You lack the time, ability, and will to think outside the box. You might even work in a building with cubicles, literally working inside of a box. The first 20 minutes of *Office Space* is an accurate portrayal of your life. I'm sure you go out and ""do things"", but you aren't fulfilled.

So I dare you to try and *think* for once. Do you really think that you can change my mind, with all the evidence against you?

If you are incapable of doing that, or you just don't want to, the only thing I ask of you, is to please capitalize your sentences."

"No

Why?  I just don't handle caffeine well.  I went on a health kick in college after drinking almost a case of soda a day for a while.  Stopped drinking caffeine in any form.  Since then I've been almost entirely unable to drink caffeine.  It makes me ridiculously jittery and twitchy.  It feels awful.  I drank a bottle of NoS once at a LAN and ended up being up for the next day and night.  My body was completely exhausted but i was still wide awake.  It was a horrible experience."
