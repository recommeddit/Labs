32037,best hotel to live in,"Nothing fancy or exotic, but I will always love the Home Hotel in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. The rooms are very nice and reasonably priced, and it’s right across the bridge from some public hot springs. Even better - the hotel rooms have their own jacuzzi style bath tubs (large enough for two people) that are connected to the hot spring system. 

The two times I’ve stayed there, the service has been incredible, and the owners surprised the guests with homemade baked goods each morning, even though they don’t offer a continental breakfast or whatever. For a little middle-of-nowhere tourist trap of a town, this hotel is what keeps me coming back.

Edit: I forgot one of the best features! Each room is themed after a famous artist! My favorite room is the Gustav Klimt room."

14618,best romantic novel,"For me it's definitely *The Simple Wild* and its sequel *Wild at Heart* by K.A. Tucker. It was the Alaska setting that got me to start, because I'm forever looking for books set in Alaska until I can finally go there myself, but beyond that, there are so many other things--a complicated relationship with parents, an enemies to lovers that feels believable in a contemporary setting without being silly or mean, a first kiss scene I re-read over and over, and a heroine who's flawed but relatable and still someone you can root for. In general I don't get excited about series where it's all just one couple, especially in contemporary where the storyline isn't necessarily plot-driven, but here I am counting down the days until the christmas novella.  

Chloe Liese's *Only When It's Us* is another one. That book took me completely by surprise and stole my heart, and I'm still shocked that such a total treasure of a book is on KU. I remember texting a friend about 30% of the way into it and telling her she had to read it, because I could just tell it was going to be wonderful.

When it comes to Sarina Bowen and Rebecca Yarros, I feel like I rec them both pretty often but mix it up with the actual books suggested a little more, maybe just because they have larger bodies of work? But you'll still find one of the two of them in pretty much every recommendation I give. From Sarina Bowen I'll forever suggest *The Year We Fell Down* as NA perfection, *Him* with Elle Kennedy for M/M, and the entirety of the True North series but especially *Bittersweet*. And from Rebecca Yarros, *Nova* (the Renegades #2) and *Full Measures* (Flight and Glory #1) are more NA series favorites (although they could be standalone if you wanted), while *Great and Precious Things* is a good standalone."

28641,best breakfast foods,"Koreans go all fucking out. You want scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast? Fuck that. And fuck you too, for good measure. You're getting seaweed soup, a bowl of rice, kimchi, an egg soufflé, and maybe some sort of meat in a mix of vegetables. Seriously heavy, heavy breakfasts. And my aunts go ape shit if I refuse. Sometimes all I want is a cup of coffee and a muffin man. Oh well, it's good food nonetheless."

12196,best gifts for dad,"Look, I will fully admit that this is a first world problem that I had in the 1970s. I am not proud that this sticks in my brain as being annoying. But your post really hit a nerve that I remember from my childhood where my mother just really couldn't remember what I had asked for. She never wrote it down. I mean, I know this for what it is: just a childlike misunderstanding of what's important to adults. It's disrespectful on my part to still be carrying this mental baggage.

But she drove herself crazy asking for the wrong Lego set at the toy store. She often came back with the wrong Lego. Sometime she didn't even have a Lego at all, almost implying that I had asked for something that did not exist.

One example was the classic 483, ""ALPHA-1 ROCKET BASE."" Now as an adult I get that that's a bunch of nonsense word strung together, especially to a suburban housewife in the late 1970s. You have a Greek letter, followed by a number, followed by a noun that has a scifi concept in it, and a generic noun which could be replaced by a variety of generic nouns. Because she did not write things down, she would go to Sullivans toy store in the local mall, and ask for something like, ""Alfalfa One, Spaceship plaza."" Or something to that effect. Sometimes she just made up entirely new sentences, like, ""Happy starship astronaut face.""

And then on Christmas Day, I would open up a present that was completely unexpected, probably because my mom shouted out some sort of nonsense that had to been decoded by the toy store manager. In fact, I bet that happened to that manager a lot from multiple suburban mothers of the era. I can imagine one Micronauts were popular, that created all kinds of problems. The only reason I got into Micronauts was because my mother accidentally bought them when I asked for Legos. This is not a complaint. So when I opened up the gift on Christmas day, sometimes I would be forced to look at a generic astronaut action figure. Maybe it was a bag full of alien finger puppets.  Once it was a Nerf toy that was a tank that had rockets that would shoot off of a tube. And it was extremely frustrating, even when I would go to the toy store with her and point to the actual box. ""This one. I want this one.""

Sometimes she remembered the Lego. We didn't have Megablocks back then, those came when I was a teenager and some of my friends younger siblings ended up with those horrible ripoffs. But I would get a set that I already owned, or was not related to what I asked. And then I would have to fake being happy about it, which only reinforced this behavior, and I felt very frustrated by the whole thing.

I mean, sometimes she got it right. So it was kind of a crapshoot. But that one alpha-1 base? I ended up saving up money and buying it myself.

Ugh, is a very embarrassing confession. And I really hope I drop it after I post this."

3997,best online college,"This is a hard one to answer as I had the career first. As far as that's concerned the degree, and the certs, are assisting immensely. Online school, nonprofit, nationally and regionally accredited, is great. I have tried the for profits and agree with the top poster, they do nothing to ready you for the real world. This school does a fantastic job of trying to prepare you for real life. It focuses a great deal on the assessment end of things but, the tests are applicable, in the IT majors many finals are industry cert exams, bonus. Only about half of the courses have an exam at the end, the others you're expected to turn in a document of some kind. I did a science paper and turned in video and pictures with the project, very contemporary. 


If you're interested in online school and think you have the self discipline, do your research, find a quality online degree program, with reputable  accreditation and the experience is great. Self discipline is not optional, no one is there holding your hand.

I have purposefully not mentioned the school by name, I don't want to be accused of being a plant of some kind. If you can't find them with the details I've given (basically it's the only school that meets this criteria), PM me."

It sounds cliche, but it's exactly what I wanted. It proved to me that he  listens when I ramble on about my passion for cooking/baking. This year, I'm hoping for the same amount of thoughtfulness in whatever he decides to do (since my daughter is only 2, he's still responsible for the gift giving)."

30468,best Mexican war to study,"Peloponese War (Sparta & allies vs. Athens & allies). Incredible long, hard fought war. However the 80 year long war between Spain and the Netherlands was no weekend skirmish either.

Finally I have always been very fascinated by Venice. A Republic/oligarchy for a thousand years, with a focus on trade and profit, but no slouches at warfare either."
