"Aus/NZ bot pretty much fit the bill but yeah they're far away. Having said that, as an Australian who's lived in the us and now in Canada, I could afford to travel a *lot* more making Aussie wages than I could in the US or can now in Canada. 

Retail was a lot cheaper in the us, but not enough to make up for the shitty healthcare (#1 my ass!), horrific infrastructure and crappy pay. Everything's expensive in Canada, much like Australia, but the pay is crappy here. 

Australia does have a backward, parochial racism to it that's the opposite of charming, and I find that refreshingly absent in Canada.

New Zealand is incredibly pretty, full of awesome people, socially progressive on a whole other level, and mind-numbingly boring."

"Oh my god Black Silk! I once saw a goodreads review that describes Ivory's writing having ""a sort of literary 'fat'"" and it was such an accurate description. Her writing is just **rich**. I still vividly remember scenes, characters, I feel like I was actually there? And I read this book three years ago. The scene where they're sitting in the grass, and her black dress and the top of her head are hot from the summer sun - it's like I can smell it, it's crazy."
The same description could apply to chess as well.
Rocky Road.
Verizon is generally the best. I don't know who's the worst out of the four.
">Yep, there is something transcendental about how the much-maligned, cheap, shitty lager, when drunk ice-cold in the shade on a blazing hot day, surrounded by pleasant company and goodwill, at that moment becomes the purest liquid to pass human lips; a veritable ambrosia.

That is fucking poetry my dude"

"I will definitely consider it, thanks!"
You should include a sniff test in future reviews.  Nice results thanks for sharing :)
(￣(ｴ)￣)ﾉ Yep.
It’s barely covered at all. At least in MN.
Ukulele. It just makes me feel so damn peppy
"Unfortunately, the contaminated hand sanitizer wasn’t just sold at dollar stores. It was sold at BJ’s, Costco, Sam’s Club, and many other national retailers.

I know because I bought some at BJ’s a couple months ago. I was using it multiple times a day. When I found out about the recall, I checked my lot number, registered for a refund, and tossed the contaminated leftover hand sanitizer. I also put to rest the mystery about why I’d been experiencing terrible stomach cramps with diarrhea and fatigue. Methyl alcohol poisoning sucks!"
When will they let u do it other ways than the current way I just don’t want my dad seeing I signed up fir att prepaid for certain reasons
"First of all congratulations for having a reason to go for a honeymoon :)

Second, as a lifelong self organized travler I would say do not go for an all-inclusive! I know it sounds like fun and nothing-to-worry about kind of vacation, but trust me, you miss soooo much!

What is the reason for going to Cancun or Bali if on fact all you get is a kind of golden-bar-prison? You only get to see the place you stay at and something that you can get to with an organized tour?

There is really nothing to be afraid of, I suppose that for the price you get to pay for a all-inclusive honeymoon around classic US destinations you can self-organize a month long tour around Europe? 

Think about places like Sicily, Balearics, Croatia, mainland Italy, Vis island, Amsterdam, Madeira, Canary Islands etc. In all this places you can safely just make a booking through some trivago, booking.com and not really worry about safety or quality :)

Go around scouting for small local restaurants as you are there, taste the culture, see how it looks like outside a resort! :)"
"vi, or vscode... Yeah, I know, but vscode is pretty nice if your going to bother with a gui."
I have a question about adaptive sync! Is screen tearing definitely going to happen if I don't use adaptive sync? I have a budget build in the works with a 1050 ti and was planning on getting a monitor with 1080p and 75 hz. I saw the examples you posted and I definitely want to avoid screen tearing. It sounds like without adaptive sync your fps and hz will almost always be different thus creating screen tear?
Happy reading!
A great mention for The MorningLightMountain chapter - truly memorable.

"The lavender rose just sounded pretty, and I'd never had floral flavors before. I used [this](https://www.sugarhero.com/lavender-rose-ice-cream/) recipe and tweaked it here and there. It's not bad at all, though my family wasn't as fond of the floral flavor (more for me at least). 

The banana pudding is usually made w/ an egg/custard-y vanilla base, some bananas, and Nilla wafers (and topped w/ whipped cream, of course). Dessert puddings are also cream-based and just isn't frozen (and maybe has a few different ingredients/proportions), so in a sense, it is kind of like making the pudding and just putting it into ice cream. Though I think technically, my recipe would've made it banana custard...but whatever. I think most banana pudding recipes I know use eggs in the pudding anyway, though I haven't made it myself. 

The licorice one is mainly because black licorice is my favorite candy. Even if it weren't, the flavor of it seems to do well in cold desserts like ice cream. But it's definitely more unusual. I've only had it a couple times since it's very hard to find. I hope to try and make it soon though."
