34599,best NFL player,"Having HOF QBs is what allowed Rice to rack up 3 rings and so many wins. It's not something that helped his stats. He played with 2 efficient but not-high-volume passers for his entire career, he would have put up the same or better numbers with worse QBs who threw more. It's been proven time and time again that worse QBs will lean on their #1 target more often and the #1 target will put up better statistical numbers."
