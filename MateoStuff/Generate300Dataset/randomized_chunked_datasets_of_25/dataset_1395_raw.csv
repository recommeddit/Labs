Allright will try them. If you find/know any other sites that have audiobooks (especially from graphic audio) let me know!
Not even shilling but I have Chrome set up the same way.
"[Britney Spears - Work Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt8VYOfr8To)   Not a huge fan of most of her music, but this song is an excellent workout song."
"The Flex is a take-down version of the Free concept.
It shares design elements and general feel, with some less expensive materials.

The new Free RN (flyknit or not) could be a nice transition for you. 

The flex fury is a great value shoe at $80"
"King Kong!

Edit: I actually had the original 1933 one in mind."
Gray minds think alike.
"Make 59 pancakes 50 waffles, 50 sausages,  500 eggs, but only eat one strawberry and say ""sorry hon I'm late for work"""
"Not sure what Iâ€™m gonna get. I kind of want to go without a case, but I have a 1 year old at home sooo..."
Hirshfields blue period. It will make the fireplace stand out! Its dark but will look stunning!
Cotton candy
"Watched the trailer for Santa Clarita diet, looks really good plus a solid cast thank you!"
I wish I had studied something that would have made me an astronaut
"To a certain extent, yes. A lot of those fields are things where employers don't care about your degree, they want to see your portfolio. You may want to think about looking for internships instead. 

That being said, taking some classes and honing your skills and doing some networking isn't a bad idea. Look into community colleges - you can do all those things, get a 2 year degree, build up a portfolio, and not be left with crushing student debt."
Dasani hands down. Why do they add salt as an ingredient in their water???
"Dolphin, but prefer mc/micro."
"Lucifer.

With additional arcs to the crime solving."
"Yes, it is a bit unrealistic. Even the laziest dog needs to be walked everyday. If it is not exercised and/or properly trained, it will destroy things, act out, etc. There is no dog that automatically comes with perfect manners -- these things require daily effort and maintenance! 

You don't sound extremely into the idea of a dog. They aren't the sort of pet you can just sort of feed and ignore the rest of the time (like hamsters, fish, lizards, cats, etc.). They require a lot of attention."
"If you like blues for the feel, get a Hotswap board and some brown switches. Similar force, no noise. Plenty of inexpensive Hotswap boards out there too."
"Yeah it's on Netflix, Hulu AND Amazon Prime."
So is it one sock day for Christopher Robin?
"If it's ODIs, my all-time NZ XI would be:

Guptill, Turner, Williamson, Crowe (c), Taylor , Cairns (not sure if I can say his name), McCullum, Vettori, Hadlee, Bond, Boult 


this just my opinion tho"
"Ho boy!

The kill counts will save you countless hours of watching horror movies that you otherwise wouldn't want to see. Those are my personal faves"
"[Win32Pad](http://www.gena01.com/win32pad/) is a cool alternative to Notepad for simple editing.

 32k file size and is only limited by the amount of memory you have when opening large files."
Upright freezer over a chest freezer any day. I've had both and chest is a pain to find things on the bottom.
I appreciate this!
