70449,best major to study in college,"I'm a math major.

The best part about my major is learning how certain results can lead to many other properties of mathematics. It's also quite fascinating how many different fields there are. Also in my specific program most of the professors and students are great to be around.

The worst part is trying to prove these results you learned in all of your classes are true. Sometimes it's straightforward. Sometimes its abstract and rigorous, and you can sometimes spend a really long time figuring out what to do. Upper division math is like this at the core, and many people really struggle with proofs and end up failing classes like real analysis and abstract algebra. But when you figure out a hard proof it's a great feeling."
