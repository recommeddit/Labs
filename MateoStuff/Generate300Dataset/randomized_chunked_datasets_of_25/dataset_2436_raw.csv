I actually really like it. What's the general consensus?
Oh my god. I‚Äôve seen all of those except IT vs sales guy and it just made my fucking day üòÇ
"Required curricula for Texas, at least. It is not taught in a glorified way these days though not a condemning one either."
"I used to get Hindu but stopped it last week because I wasn't reading them.

The news websites I follow are:

Hindu, Indian Express, Guradian, Financial Times(only the free arts and leisure section, it's awesome) and Le Parisien. Last one because I am trying to learn French.

Rest whatever links they post on /r/india /r/IndiaInvestments and /r/worldnews"

Basically feel like a T1 or Holy panda as is.

If they aren‚Äôt enough for you just swap out the stems with halo trues to get the actual holy panda"
"It changes depending on the size of the guild. And I actually don't cut anything. I just sandbag everything with a number of ""average votes"" sort of the way BGG does it for their ""BGG Rating"". Things under 200 or so ratings need to be REALLY well liked to get on this list."

"I initially thought I won't use any screen protector at all, until I saw some hairline scratches on my screen. Not sure how it even got there, never dropped and always in a case.

"They‚Äôre amazing. My impact driver has lasted years, and despite hours of use every day, has powered in so many screws that it leaves my arm trembling. 

I guess we both mean the same thing, though?"

"Thank you very much for your feedback! Just started reading it, its really informative and explain well, Thanks alot!"
"how does one find the perfect pillow

"It also depends on what you mean by respected. There are plenty of politicians that are respected by their own party. With Lincoln also remember that he was in the middle of a Civil War. There were quite a few people who didn't agree with him and literally fought against his ideas. (Well that is a simplification but basically right) It is only thorough a historical perspective (and people who disagreed with him dying off) that he became universally loved. 

I was just trying to find examples that were respected by the majority of Americans as well as internationally. (At least if the statues of Washington and Lincoln in the UK are any indication)"
"Holy shit.

And I've just been visiting an ENT doctor?!?"
"Piano may be one of the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù ones at first, but it‚Äôs a difficult instrument in the long run because the field is so over saturated.

Yes! I would love to visit the China Amans. The only problem is that all other hotels will seem rather pedestrian after an Amanstay :)
"Most people mistake a burnt to a crisp charcoal coating as good seasoning, rather than polymerized oils that keep that sheen and non stick surface."
