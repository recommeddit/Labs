5920,best programming language for web development,"That's actually the reason why I think Rails+Vue/Laravel+Vue are such good fits. They have the same ""it just works magically"" concept."
5963,best programming language for web development,"If you're going into web, JavaScript is pretty essential. It is going to have relevance regardless of the back end route you go (and if you choose to learn node, it will be even more all encompassing). 

SQL is obviously a must (don't get trapped into having complete dependency on ORMs).

As for back end... You will hear all sorts of conflicting information on this topic. People tend to have strong biases in this area; but in reality just choose one. Java, PHP, Python, C#, Node, Go, are all good places to start. I've mostly been a .NET developer over my 10 year professional career, and really enjoy C#, however I am always jumping into new languages just for fun (currently playing around with Python). You're going to be starting pretty simple anyways, so don't agonize over this decision. The important thing is to just start writing code. Once you have core concepts understood, you can transition from language to language with relative ease."

53427,best usb c charging cable,"Thanks for the clarification - I wasn't sure about this point. I have follow up questions:

1. What makes a fast charge cable fast charge? 
2. Whats the difference between the older USB A and the new USB C PD cables?
2. AFAIK the problem wouldn't happen with old USB A type cable connected to some non fast charging, is that correct?"

73829,best matte screen protector for ipad,"For writing notes it feels pretty much the same IMO. I tried Paperlike and did not like it, took it off after a few months and will not be using the 2nd one in the pack. Scratches easily, reduces screen quality. When I took it off I did a half glass half Paperlike writing comparison and it felt the same. You’ll get used to it, just give it some time and practice."
