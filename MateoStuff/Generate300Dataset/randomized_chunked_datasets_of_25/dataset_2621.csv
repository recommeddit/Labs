5963,"If you're going into web, JavaScript is pretty essential. It is going to have relevance regardless of the back end route you go (and if you choose to learn node, it will be even more all encompassing). 

SQL is obviously a must (don't get trapped into having complete dependency on ORMs).

As for back end... You will hear all sorts of conflicting information on this topic. People tend to have strong biases in this area; but in reality just choose one. Java, PHP, Python, C#, Node, Go, are all good places to start. I've mostly been a .NET developer over my 10 year professional career, and really enjoy C#, however I am always jumping into new languages just for fun (currently playing around with Python). You're going to be starting pretty simple anyways, so don't agonize over this decision. The important thing is to just start writing code. Once you have core concepts understood, you can transition from language to language with relative ease.",best programming language for web development

Scratches easily, reduces screen quality. When I took it off I did a half glass half Paperlike writing comparison and it felt the same.
