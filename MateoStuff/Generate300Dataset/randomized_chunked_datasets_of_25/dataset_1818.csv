In the other direction, I have a thing for musky scents. I love wearing Jovan Musk for Men. It doesn’t smell like men’s cologne when I wear it.

23471,"I miss the old Gran Turismo games that did this. Crappy car, drive those amateur league races, buying a used car which was a limited selection deal, so you ended up with a car you might not usually go for that you eventually ended up loving. 

Racing games these days just shower you with cars and money, killing all sense of meaningful progression. Then you have to artificially limit yourself which always feels like complete shit.",best car racing video game

34576,">Peyton Manning only moved up one spot from 2010 to 2021, regardless of the fact that between both years he had a 55 touchdown season in which he won the MVP and added another Superbowl a few years later.

The 55 TD season is what moved him up a slot, but only someone just reading accomplishments off a stat sheet who never watched the games would say 2015 adds to his legacy on a list with other top all-time players.",best NFL player

3233,Ok. For this cam the setting that helped me the most was gain. It seems to be very light sensitive. Washout happens with most of my desk lighting. Works like a charm for green screen for the same reason it washes me out. I have some led desk lamps. They have a built in filter but I made a diffuser for them anyway to break up the light some. Gain and Saturation. Less adjustment than you think for a big difference. Each situation will be different. I tested what I was going to say with different styles of lighting. All needed different adjustments. I wanted to give you guys some numbers or settings but I can’t do that without being you in front of it. It’s a great cam and has done well for me. No complaints. Everything needs tweaking. Nothing is perfect right out of the box.,best webcamera

8052,"Thanks for starting the guide.  Very helpful.

One tricky item is that outside of Apple and Microsoft, there is tremendous variation in quality between various lines of computers and even model-to-model differences. With Apple and Microsoft, everything they make is of similar quality.  Sure, they have the occasional miss like the tiny-bit-too-short ribbon cables from base to screen in MacBook Pro 2016s or the dodgy wifi in Surface Pro 4, but generally speaking Apple and Surface are high quality.  Neither are particularly repairable though with Surface devices basically being more-or-less sealed entirely. 

But outside Apple and Microsoft, it is harder to pick a single brand and instantly know what to expect. For example, HP has laptops (from best to worst or most expensive to least expensive):

* Elite
* Spectre
* Envy
* Pavillion
* ""HP"" no sub-brand

With quality ranging significantly from the top lines to the bottom lines. An Elite Dragonfly is going to be built to a much higher standard than a Pavillion. Likewise, Lenovo offers the ThinkPad line which are all built like tanks and even the cheapest ThinkPads (also not that cheap) are pretty good. They also offer the Yoga line (not to be confused with the ThinkPad Yoga), and then a notch down the IdeaPads.",best laptop for general use
34437,"> Jerry Rice touchdown with barely any time left against the Bengals in the Super Bowl

i genuinely have no idea what you're talking about. perhaps that play isn't as iconic as you think?

you're basically punishing Brady here for not having short clocks or not needing TDs. against the Rams Brady lead a game-winning field goal drive with a short clock, and against the Giants ('08) and Seahawks Brady lead TD drives to take the lead with fewer than 2 minutes left. against the Giants the defense gave the game back and against the Seahawks it almost did. Neither of those undo the fact that Brady lead his team to a TD late when he needed to.",best NFL player
