69105,"I’ve read and enjoyed many of the previous (and hand out Snow Crash to folks who like SFF but don’t know Stephenson), but here are 3 others that I’ve enjoyed as fun - and sometimes thoughtful - reads:

(1) Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon, by Spider Robinson (especially The Time Traveler’s Lament, which I think is the 2nd story in the book)
(2) Dream Park, by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes
(3) the Circuit series, by Melinda Snodgrass - jurisprudence in space! Unfortunately out of print but possibly available at a Half-Price Books near you.

Other honorable mentions: 
* David Weber’s Honor Harrington series (On Basilisk Station was mentioned above - it’s the first book of what I think is a series of 18+ novels, some of which are better than others; if you’re not familiar with it, think “Horatio Hornblower in space”)
* Flatlander by Larry Niven - its subtitle is “the collected stories of Gil ‘the arm’ Hamilton”, and it’s a series of locked-room mysteries which I remember enjoying (but admittedly it’s been quite a while since I read them...)

Thank you to the OP - I love seeing threads like this that suggest new things to check out!",best science fiction novel

72618,"Right now, Kailh Box Navy since they have a nice actuation point (I used to use MX Blacks; but didn't really want to stay with linear switches, so 60g feels right to me) and they have a hefty 90g bottom out. They feel quite crisp and smooth out of the box (no pun intended) and they're loud as fuck.     

Definitely not something I'd use if I were in an office or classroom or if I had someone sleeping nearby but damn do I find them satisfying to press.      

I haven't tried any of the more boutique switches, my reasoning is ignorance is bliss. Box Navies are something like $3.50 per 10 while these more boutique switches are like $5 - $10 per 10. Maybe I'll change up the switches for my next keyboard build (I'm considering an ortho like the Planck) but for now I'm content with the Box Navy switches.",best keyboard switches
