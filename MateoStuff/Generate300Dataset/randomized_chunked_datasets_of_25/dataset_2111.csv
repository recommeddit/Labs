**seperate** is actually spelled **separate**. You can remember it by **-par- in the middle**.  
Have a nice day!

69105,best science fiction novel,"I’ve read and enjoyed many of the previous (and hand out Snow Crash to folks who like SFF but don’t know Stephenson), but here are 3 others that I’ve enjoyed as fun - and sometimes thoughtful - reads:

(1) Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon, by Spider Robinson (especially The Time Traveler’s Lament, which I think is the 2nd story in the book)
(2) Dream Park, by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes
(3) the Circuit series, by Melinda Snodgrass - jurisprudence in space! Unfortunately out of print but possibly available at a Half-Price Books near you.

Other honorable mentions: 
* David Weber’s Honor Harrington series (On Basilisk Station was mentioned above - it’s the first book of what I think is a series of 18+ novels, some of which are better than others; if you’re not familiar with it, think “Horatio Hornblower in space”)
* Flatlander by Larry Niven - its subtitle is “the collected stories of Gil ‘the arm’ Hamilton”, and it’s a series of locked-room mysteries which I remember enjoying (but admittedly it’s been quite a while since I read them...)

Thank you to the OP - I love seeing threads like this that suggest new things to check out!"

67188,axios alternatives reddit,"There is no need for these libraries. Someone just can use the fetch api, which is well supported by node. But it’s a bit more complicated to use and the code isn’t that elegant. And sure it has its pitfalls (but look at the issue counter for the suggested libraries ;))

These libraries don’t reinvent http requests, they use the fetch api or similar things anyway."

15999,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'd like to start by encouraging everyone to wear sunglasses with UV protection! They'll protect your vision and the delicate skin around your eyes. You wanna be able to see your swanky outfits when you're 90, right?

My sunglasses and my watch are the only accessories I wear. I got [these](https://cdnb.lystit.com/photos/2012/06/26/kate-spade-tortoise-angelique-twotone-plastic-catseye-sunglasses-product-1-4014836-635226018.jpeg) tortoiseshell cat eye glasses from Kate Spade about a year ago. They're the most flattering glasses I've had to date.

54410,best artisan mousepad alternatives,I don't have to justify anything. It's my money and I like to have nice things.
72618,best keyboard switches,"Right now, Kailh Box Navy since they have a nice actuation point (I used to use MX Blacks; but didn't really want to stay with linear switches, so 60g feels right to me) and they have a hefty 90g bottom out. They feel quite crisp and smooth out of the box (no pun intended) and they're loud as fuck.     

Definitely not something I'd use if I were in an office or classroom or if I had someone sleeping nearby but damn do I find them satisfying to press.      

I haven't tried any of the more boutique switches, my reasoning is ignorance is bliss. Box Navies are something like $3.50 per 10 while these more boutique switches are like $5 - $10 per 10. Maybe I'll change up the switches for my next keyboard build (I'm considering an ortho like the Planck) but for now I'm content with the Box Navy switches."
46755,best hand santizer brand,"Thank you . For this. I would like to add that Germ X is questionable itself. It seems to be 62% alcohol.  I like to go with 70% or higher and if that it only contains thickening agents, aloe vera and water. The less ingredients, the better

Anything less than 66% alcohol,  is sanitation theater."

41069,best instrument to play,"Fretted instruments are much easier to play properly than fretless.

My vote for ""easiest"" is something like a xylophone. Perhaps a drum kit.

Ultimately it doesn't matter because what you have to matter is rhythm, harmony and melody and it's the same for any instrument."
