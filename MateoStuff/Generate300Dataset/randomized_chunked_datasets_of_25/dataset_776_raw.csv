"Same! I've been wearing it since for probably 10 years, I feel like I've outgrown it but I love it. I also have a few of the other ones, preppy princes, glam princess, and there's another one I can't remember the name of. The only one I don't have is rock princess I think."
I think this will be known as the decade that ended CF's reign at the top of US parks and the decade that was the start of amazing times for SEA parks.
Dirty John!!
"It shows which teams actually are regulars in the biggest club competition in the world. It shows which teams survive long enough in the competition to get all those points and goals. 

It shows that Juventus often qualify for the tournament, make a deep run while consistently outscoring their opponent. It shows that although Inter have won it 3 times, they haven't been making deep runs in the tournament as often as Juventus. It shows that while Inter's success have come mainly from 2 eras, they quite frankly haven't been successful in the competition for as many decades/eras as Juve. 

For Arsenal specifically, I really don't think it's that far fetched to see them so highly."
Streetlight is also another great one!
Green mangoes with shrimp paste is the shit though
"Picked up my Shure SE535s for $300 up here in Canada :) And my DT990 Pros for $150. :) Definitely can be deals to had, just not as many as you lucky bastards. ;)"

"Try the evermore books
It's a great series!
There is about 7 or 8 books"
I have no clue because the new formula is clearly inferior. I'm just glad someone else thinks so too!
"Because she spents 3 months straight on a small ass boat (well, small relative to a cruise ship). The last thing she wants to do when she gets off is be on a boat."

"Hi, I would look at /r/laptopdealseurope for deals in your country.

I'd say that at this time, the [**ASUS Vivobook M413DA**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-VivoBook-X512DA-R5-3500-Windows/dp/B089Q2PWN8/&tag=laptopz18-21) is the best value choice. You get a 4-core Ryzen 5 3500U processor, 8 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" display. Otherwise, if you spend a bit more (that would be ideal for video editing), I'd go for the [**Huawei Matebook D 15**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HUAWEI-MateBook-Multi-Screen-Collaboration-Fingerprint/dp/B08HR3W84V/&tag=laptopz18-21) when it restocks."
CONSENT-based dirty talk!! It’s like: consent consent all over the place!!! (At least in all the ones I’ve read) I love it!!!!
Sometimes I wish I had bad hangovers. Maybe I wouldn't drink so much if there was more of a negative price to pay.
">lets just say that if you lived in cali, you'd be the type of person afraid to out in public because of all the warnings about getting cancer that is everywhere because of prop 65.

Oh, I was just talking about this the other day! It's funny because CA puts that warning on literally **everything**, so people just ignore it instead of actually being worried about the things that do cause cancer, like asbestos, lead, common carcinogens like fossil fuels, and even sunlight! Too much sunlight, that is.

Born in Napa, lived in Navato, San Fran, and San Diego by the way. Catch a wave and check out my sweet tan sometime.

>i never said that stuff in excess wasn't bad for you.

You kind of did.

> but i'm not worried about drinking acidic water or having non zero ppm for minerals and chemicals.

You should. Just a little at least.

>i'm mean sure, cocacola can rust a nail, but so what?  the human body isn't a nail.  so don't fall for this fallacy.

So diabetes, bone decalcification, tooth enamel wear, carbonic acid build up, and being a fat piece of shit don't worry you?

Thanks for proving all my points.

Anyway, you're the kind of person who is so absolutely enamored in the philosophy of ""this is the way we've always done it"", that you can't see that you've been doing it wrong the whole time.

You can't even capitalize your sentences.

There's no helping you. Goodbye."

I like margaritas and dark beers. Don’t mix them though."

Witcher 3
It *is* very much ahead of its time. There's no racing game that matches NFS2 in my heart. Even now.
"A hot toddy made by my favorite bartender.  A heavy shot of bourbon, juice of half a lemon, a packet of sugar steamed with an espresso machine and served in a brandy snifter.  Put your face over it and inhale, then drink it slowly.  You will feel instantly better and by the time you sober up, your cold is gone."
"Those disgusting gelatin food-wannabes. Like the hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. http://www.dutchvalleyfoods.com/images/products/detail/pic1/699691.jpg I always black-listed the houses that gave those out."
You should consider adding the Imperial Library!
