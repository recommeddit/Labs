31906,I lived in a decent hotel in Hong Kong for 3-4 months a few years ago. The monthly rate was much much less than the nightly rate and not much more than renting an independent apartment long term. I forget the price but it must have been less than $3000 a month and that included daily breakfast. Was a suite type place with one bedroom and a living room off it. No kitchen. Just suited my lifestyle at the time.,best hotel to live in

He came to visit the new enlisted rec center they built for us back in the mid 00’s to do a meet and greet. While he was only booked to be there from 1400 to 1600, when we told him that most of the SUBSCOL students didn’t get out class until then he said he’d be more than willing to stay later. He hung out with all the guys who came to see him shooting pool, playing darts and Xbox, and pretty much signing everything and taking a ton of pictures. The dude is just a straight up class act.",best celebrity
