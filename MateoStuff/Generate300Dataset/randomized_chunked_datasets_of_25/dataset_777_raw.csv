This is my signature go to fragrance when I want to get noticed. Endless compliments.

"Its hard to see anyone beating in India in India for the foreseeable future, really. But this India side will need to beat Australia/England away over the next 18 months to really be considered dominant, imo."
"This monitor is just for gaming, so response time is the most important thing"
"My man, The only comment that makes sense."
Ant Man and The Wasp was Phase Three. So was Doctor Strange.....
I really hope computer science is the way to go.
"Good idea, but my FIL really want ""all-inclusive"", and I'm trying to explain to him that he might be better to budget for the other expenses, but it's proving difficult. There are health issues that keep us in the states as well. Thanks for your reply =)

Edit...I've been looking at TX, can you recommend anything, even if not allinclusive?"
I really hope they release an updated paperback with the fifth story.

"I'm going to sneak a piggy-backed question in here maybe someone can help.  I have a couple of questions about Hard Rock, check in is at 4pm.  I have a park ticket for that first day, can I take advantage of the express pass the day of, or do I have to wait for the day following check in?  Also, can I leave my luggage with them to take to my room when it's ready while I'm in the park?"

You have to show your seniors card at a special old people shop to get them. Its the only way they come into the world

"You could have fluff in the charger port, new cables sometimes fix the issue for abit for some reason, my local phone shop has a tiny and I mean tiny spoon to get it out with."
"I agree with the [**Dell G5 laptop,**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CD3MRZF/ref=twister_B07FKR9DDX?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=laptopz18-20) it is a great price for an i7-8750H 6-core processor and GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. 16 GB of RAM should be enough for you. It will be able to run the programs you listed easily. Tad heavy, but that's the tradeoff for excellent specs."
"Iphone SE 2016, that thing lasted throughout almost anything I could throw at it. Getting lost on ski hills, flipped over canoes etc etc

Loved the design, form factor and 3.5 mm AUX. Still best phone I think they ever released based on value per dollar."
"Not trying to dis you but I found the 7 habits be totally pretentious and devoid of anything actionable.


GTD was my go to book for productivity but as I matured in my time management I realized it was to much focused on efficiency and not on effectiveness which is very problematic.  Since then I have been slowly chipping away on my GTD habits....my new system is basically not GTD oriented as well, takes less upkeep and is a lot more focused on effectiveness instead of completing next actions.

I guess what I am saying is GTD is better than nothing but it takes you to the wrong direction."
Studio C has so many good skits.

"Thank you! Now Im looking for an inoffensive cologne for work. Theres someone I really want to think I smell good, but I dont want to annoy anyone in the office. Would YSl L'Homme be more appropriate than La Nuit? Or would Aventus/Green Irish Tweed be better?"
"And stay away from t-Mobil. Too many random payments on bills! 45€ for ""connection fees"" last month!"
Ah gotcha maybe talk to Adzerk? If you pm me I can intro you
10 out of 10 dentist dont recommend a brand they simply recommend brushing. if they do recommend a brand they are getting kickbacks from that company so their recommendation is worthless.
