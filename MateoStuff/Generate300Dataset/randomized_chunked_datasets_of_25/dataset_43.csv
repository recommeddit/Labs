67700,">IE10? How’s that even still available?

As it was the default browser in Win8 and WinSvr2012, it has a support life-cycle tied to those OSs. Win8.0 is already completely EOL (8.1 is supported, though came with IE11) but Svr2012 has extended support until 2023. Thankfully few use that for active browsing.

I've only been released from having to support IE8 on some of our work in the last year-ish.  
IE11 is still what a lot of our clients'^(\[†\]) users are stuck with.
