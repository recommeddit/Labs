Yeah, it's very annoying playing a guessing game and asking people on reddit, lol.

4357,"First, thanks for the thread. I spent a lot of time trying to find a good one and finally started working with the free (time limited) version of UltraEdit. The thing I most wanted it to do though was highlight the differences in a couple of files opened side by side, and could sometimes get that to work for a large part of the files, but sometimes (if I remember right) not at all. Finally did it manually.

And thanks for all the comments and suggestions. I now have at least one more to check out next time I need one.",best text editor
34141,"Randy Moss has every single physical you would want in a WR: he's tall, he's fast, he can jump, and he has amazing hands. Plus when you watched him play (while he was trying) it was like watching ballet. He was so graceful it was incredible. When he was sprinting it was like he was almost gliding. It's purely his own fault that he will not go down as the greatest WR of all time.",best NFL player

In my experience, however, that isn't the case.  I see many people rushing to npm before even bothering to see what the native capabilities are and that is a bit troubling.",axios alternatives reddit

3966,"This thread is depressing. I busted my ass for four years and graduated with a 4.0 to earn my B.S. I wrote papers, diagrammed fingerprints, diagrammed crime scenes, dusted for prints, studied chemicals, took tests, did homework, bought and read all of the books, took part in real-time class seminars where I interacted with my professors, took notes, and still retain a large portion of the degree-related information. It's frustrating to know that people in positions to hire me will trash my resume just because I earned my degree online.",best online college

25070,Cos Marvel is hindered by having the overarching story to deal with. You can't have a clear or well developed trilogy of films that tells a consistent story cos you gotta keep enough the same for when Infinity War comes round. It's why Raimi Spiderman and Nolan Batman are gonna be best superhero films for awhile cos they insular (yeah Spiderman 3 and TDKR aren't great but still).,best spiderman actor

8811,"Not a dentist, but work for a large teeth whitening and toothpaste manufacturer. Echo what many dentists have said, look for the fluoride content. As for whitening toothpaste, you are not going to see dramatic differences through whitening toothpaste. The hydrogen peroxide content is so small that there is not much whitening that can occur - in general hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide should not touch the gums/tongue for an extended amount of time (this is one of the many causes sensitivity when whitening). For this reason the amount of whitening agents contained in toothpaste is minimal. Honestly you are better off getting total plaque control toothpastes and just use whitening products, rather that expect that using whitening toothpaste is going to change your tooth shade in a dramatic way. 

Important thing to note, many whitening toothpastes are not meant to be used daily, multiple times a day. In fact, you can have a lot of abrasion if you are brushing a lot with toothpastes contacting whitening agents in it.",best toothpaste
