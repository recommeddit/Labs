54163,best medicine for a cold,"You realize you used to be able to buy pot,  opium,  opium tincture, alcohol,  and cocaine over the counter and mail order in the US and everything didn't go to shit,  right? 

Lack of understanding of history is amazingly damaging to the human race."
60710,Best comedy show on Netflix,No one has commented Dave Chappelle yet? I loved his new standup.
41971,movies like Inception,Not gonna lie. I still really liked the other half.
45944,best trick or treating candy,"Candy corn tastes great until you get to the 4th piece, then it starts tasting disgusting."
30277,best Mexican war to study,"My school never taught us this, I don't even know what happened"
23003,best celebrity,"Saw Matt Damon at the Guinness storehouse in Dublin.  He seemed like he was doing his absolute best to keep a low profile, so we didn't go talk to him, but he certainly didn't seem rude.

Bonus: one of my teammates from college met Ryan Lochte after a meet.  Teammate was in his hotel room, just hanging out, and Lochte knocks on the door and asks to borrow their ironing board.  They let him have it, and a few minutes later housekeeping comes by and asks to see their ironing board.  Apparently Lochte had thrown his out the window and tried to take my friend's to cover it up.  They thought the whole thing was hilarious."
69256,best major to study in college,"I would want to pick something that is a little less location dependent.  I have a degree in engineering, and thus my job prospects are *mostly* tied to major cities, though engineers are needed just about everywhere (to some extent) due to utilities and such.  TBH, I don't like the congestion and fast pace of large cities.  I want a slower, simpler pace of life.

The flipside to this is that working remotely is at least feasible for my type of work, it's just that employers in my field seem very few and far between.

One of my biggest drivers for attaining FI is to be able to live where I want irrespective of employment opportunities.  I don't want to be shut out of moving somewhere because ""there are no good paying jobs here.""  It seems that high pay is tied to big, congested cities.  Smaller cities obviously have fewer jobs overall due to lower population, but it seems that they often lack high-paying jobs as well.  As much as being financially independent would open things up for me, even not being tied to big cities would be a good stepping stone for me.  Finding remote work would be a huge improvement in my life.

Careers that at least seem like they would be location independent, because they are needed everywhere: medicine, emergency services, education, skilled trades.  If I could do it all over, being a medical doctor in a small/medium sized city would have probably made me very happy."

4831,best home improvement store,Lowes only because of the $15 off $50 promo codes. PM me if you need some.
57157,best water brand,"My understanding is that no water is ""pure"" except distilled water, and I imagine that to taste a little flat.  All other water (tap water, mineral water, natural spring, etc) has trace amounts of minerals and ions.  This affects pH, hardness, and taste.  

On a side note, hard water is annoying, but overly soft water is too.  You'll recognize it when you shower and it feels like you can't rinse the soap off."

71325,best movies with a cool twist,It was dumb. They would have had to predict everything happening exactly as it did for it to work.
29206,best web hosting service,"Signed up with Siteground 3 yrs ago and while the service seemed great, they have increased the monthly fee continuously each year (not the initial cheap signup rate, but the standard fee), they are now far more expensive +200%). They are not worth the additional costs as it is, and I am sure they will only continue to raise rates further."
