23003,"Saw Matt Damon at the Guinness storehouse in Dublin.  He seemed like he was doing his absolute best to keep a low profile, so we didn't go talk to him, but he certainly didn't seem rude.

Bonus: one of my teammates from college met Ryan Lochte after a meet.  Teammate was in his hotel room, just hanging out, and Lochte knocks on the door and asks to borrow their ironing board.  They let him have it, and a few minutes later housekeeping comes by and asks to see their ironing board.  Apparently Lochte had thrown his out the window and tried to take my friend's to cover it up.  They thought the whole thing was hilarious.",best celebrity
69256,"I would want to pick something that is a little less location dependent.  I have a degree in engineering, and thus my job prospects are *mostly* tied to major cities, though engineers are needed just about everywhere (to some extent) due to utilities and such.  TBH, I don't like the congestion and fast pace of large cities.  I want a slower, simpler pace of life.

The flipside to this is that working remotely is at least feasible for my type of work, it's just that employers in my field seem very few and far between.

One of my biggest drivers for attaining FI is to be able to live where I want irrespective of employment opportunities.  I don't want to be shut out of moving somewhere because ""there are no good paying jobs here.""  It seems that high pay is tied to big, congested cities.  Smaller cities obviously have fewer jobs overall due to lower population, but it seems that they often lack high-paying jobs as well.  As much as being financially independent would open things up for me, even not being tied to big cities would be a good stepping stone for me.  Finding remote work would be a huge improvement in my life.

Careers that at least seem like they would be location independent, because they are needed everywhere: medicine, emergency services, education, skilled trades.  If I could do it all over, being a medical doctor in a small/medium sized city would have probably made me very happy.",best major to study in college

On a side note, hard water is annoying, but overly soft water is too.  You'll recognize it when you shower and it feels like you can't rinse the soap off.",best water brand
