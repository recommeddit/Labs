4852,best home improvement store,"I usually shop at Home Depot as it's closer to my house, doesn't require me to travel on a highway to get there, and has probably 90% of what I need.

I shop at Lowe's when Home Depot doesn't have what I need. Most recently this meant baseboard heater covers, but it also usually means decorative stuff; Lowe's typically has a more upscale selection of ceiling fans, lights, cabinet hardware, etc.

IMO, Lowe's is better, or at least more logically, organized. More than once have I gone to Home Depot to look for something which *obviously* should be in (for example) the hardware aisle, only to discover that, no, it's actually in the aisle with the mailboxes, or with the doors, or whatever. I almost never get that when I go to Lowe's; more often than not when I expect to find something in a certain aisle at Lowe's, it's right where I expect it to be."

38141,best Marvel movie,"I gotta say, Captain Marvel is probably one of the worst art-directed movies I’ve ever seen considering the budget and means these movies have.

Alien city? Basically just some glowy vague buildings, a train and a big empty fighting room

Then the next third of the movie is set in a generic facility

Then the third act is in a swampy field and then a desert field

Also Jude Law’s makeup is super boring and Ben Mendelssohn looks like he’s wearing a big rubber mask. Just absolutely the cheapest looking MCU movie"

40909,best instrument to play,"Easiest to reach ""marry had a little lamb"" level? Yeah maybe piano. Easiest to reach skill required to play songs that others will think you're absolutely insane despite practicing only for 3 weeks?   


The irish tin whistle.   


I played drums, piano, electric and acoustic guitar as well as sang, but when I picked up the whistle I couldn't believe it myself how quickly I improved. The first few days will be rough but give it 2-3 weeks I guarantee you, you'll feel like a monster. 

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMDZSO285w&ab_channel=MichaelEskin) I had down in full tempo in about 10 days of practicing 1-2 hours daily. It's a very fun instrument, though a bit limited in its range and expression."

37626,best Marvel movie,"People really hate BP but outside of MCU fanworld, it is considered one of the best Marvel movies to come out. I’m sorry that makes so many of you so uncomfortable, but I mean...let’s call a thing a thing.

Having said that, I am still absolutely obsessed with the first Avengers, so it would rank pretty high. Besides a few KEY scenes in AoU, I don’t give a damn about they movie. Thor 2 is just...ugh.

Ragnarok is awesome, IW/Endgame are great."

50564,best rap album,"Yeah, in a production (mixing etc) sense this or graduation is probably his best I think. Some of the arrangements on the songs are very easy to hear and very thing sounds natural and individual. Not that many songs are thick walls of sound, you can usually hear the stings and bass apart from the rest of the track. 

I'm not too well versed in the subject but this is just my opinion."

3931,best online college,"thanks for the reply! I am thinking about starting exactly for the learning side of it, i also believe you have to have good discipline, but I was also wondering about the job side of things. Do you think there are advantages/disadvantages of having your degree from an online school in terms of getting work in that area?"

28355,best breakfast foods,"Rice and beans made ahead of time.


Breakfast sandwich: toast your bread, fry up an egg and Canadian bacon. Add fresh greens (arugula is a personal favorite).


Try making some baked oatmeal. (An internet search should give you plenty of options). It's basically oatmeal with eggs cooked into it to make it firm, sort of like cake. Mine has lots of fruit and nuts in it. It stores and reheats well so I make it and easy it all week.


I love leftovers for breakfast. I have more food groups for dinner so it is often healthier for me than making something specifically for breakfast in the morning."
