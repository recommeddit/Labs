You’re probably thinking of node-fetch.
"libgen is oriented towards textbooks, MAM towards the rest. You can't really compare the 2

> Private trackers are terrible especially since Bib has stopped taking invites

That's not true. Even if it was, MAM would be enough for you. Any book you can't find on MAM, just make a request. If the book exists on BIB, the request will be filled."
">you can't really change his combat style

Did you even play the game? You can get through the entire thing almost never swinging your sword. If you think that there's only one play style for Gerald, thats on you. Don't unfairly label the game because of where you chose to put your points."
"Norway did get a new trainer, Ståle Solbakken, who coached FC Copenhagen for better part of a decade. And we got to see Haaland and Ødegaard really click at the end of Nations League. Netherlands is a good team though.

Also Haaland barely played in the EURO qualification campaign and we still drew Sweden twice and Spain once without him, while being the only team with an honourable result away in Spain (2-1)"
My all time favourite!
"I would definitely recommend trying it first. I think it’s really versatile, though."
"Persona 5, yakuza 5 (but start with 0, it’s great and where to start the series), and idk maybe shadowrun dragonfall or spellforce 3"
"1. is the school regionally accredited?
2. is the school non-profit?
3. does the school also have brick and mortar locations?

if the answer to all of those are yes, then it's probably not considered a joke"
My Oakley flak jackets with polarized lenses. However I usually just wear a cheap 5$ pair of sunglasses so I can throw them around
But home is 600 km away from where my mother lives...?
It doesn't have to be fluoride based though? i'm just asking because I use a baking soda based toothpaste and my teeth have improved and plaque has been reduced.
"Hmmm, but even the old Steel Phantom was vastly different from Steel Curtain today; I wouldn’t call them “basically the same.”

Also SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn offer completely different ride experiences. Aside from being hypers, they have nothing else in common. They were even manufactured by three different companies."
"Hotel Emma in San Antonio, nothing will ever top that."
"I have one of these, best winter coat I've ever had.  I thought it might compare to CG, but wasn't sure.  I bought mine for $150 the last winter Sears was open, mine is a bit longer."
"Zinc, multivitamin, vitamin c, lots of water and NyQuil. Sleep it away. I always wear sweats to bed, the warmer you are the better. If your nose is running uncontrollably use Claritin."
The harmonica is quite fun to play and not commonly used with the bands I've been around.
"Witcher 3, Dragon Age(s), Bloodborne (and Soul friends), and perhaps Kingdom Come Deliverance. plus Ghost of Tsushima."
Especially Waterfox classic has a lot of modding capability and cust. I use Waterfox classic as daily driver
Yep get the infinity run or the invincible
"you are probably right about FMA, I just said that because like i said I haven't seen it yet so I haven't experienced what you said, but I haven't experienced much. That's why it's just a mention. What you said is really cool though."
"Cedar Fair is better then Six Flags. Kings island has a bit of theme, and there are some coasters filled with trees (Beast and diamondback). Both of the Busch Gardens are the best theme parks in the US. Of course, Disney and Universal are amazing, too."
"It's an anime film, but you should absolutely check out Paprika if you haven't seen it. It is everything you stated and was a big influence on Inception."
"I have ti calculator but mostly used to check graphs. In multivariable lot of graph are 3d and the only way to get them nicely is using math programs to graph for you, otherwise you draw them as level sets, compressed onto two dimension.

But if you can, getting that calculator is always nice because for modeling more complex graph later on then it is always nice to have extra tool. Just nowadays so many graphing technologies online. But I have color Ti so it is very nice sometimes haha."
OtterBox Defender Pro is working well so far. Thick case.
I think the 30 for 30 series is great regardless of whether you're a big sports fan or not generally. I think people shouldn't hesitate checking out the rest.
