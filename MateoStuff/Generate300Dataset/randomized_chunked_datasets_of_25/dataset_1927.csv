29063,"I use Asana (and trello to an extent) on the big picture of a project but for me, there is nothing better than post it notes on the wall. 

I also have been known to use the Emergent Task Planner (also analog) over at https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/ to help the day to day tasks.

Is this method electronic, no. Have I played with various project management pieces, yes, but to no avail.

Note: I think if I were in a team, I would gravitate 
 to an online platform. The last 48h film project we did, the Google suite of online tools was of key importance for a remote editor like myself.",best calendar tool
33822,"Best sun and moon or Gen 5. There the only pokemon games with actually good story. Handles child abuse well. Sun and moon is challeing if you remove the exp share and I love the trails and totem pokemon because it does something different than the gym thing we had for so long. Unnova has best villans Ghestis and N. Alder the champion has pretty good chacther development and Iris is some of the hardest champion.  

Worst Gen 6 

&#x200B;

In gen 6 I played without the exp share the gym leader have bad movsets and most only have 3 pokemon despite there being plenty of pokemon. By time you have mega Lucario fully evolved your starter and mega kanto starter gym leader still use wepinbell emoga magneton Mewostic and other weak pokemon. Mega is a interesting idea only 4 people use it kora is tutorial and you only need 2 hits to beat her. Serna does have mega until post game and her absol only can use slash and quick attack just get a ghost type teach it toxic curse or will wisp and you win. The champion is barely there and when she is it's more focused on lysandre than her and she is easy rivals are boring etc. I probably would not hate this game so much if it did not come after platinum and Unnova.",best Pokemon game
