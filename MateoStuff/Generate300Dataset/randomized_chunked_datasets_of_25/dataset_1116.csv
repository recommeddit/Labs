27306,best stocks to buy,A lot of big companies 'had the means' to pivot to the next new or best thing in their industry but didn't. Many companies are too unwilling to kill their golden goose to pivot.
72261,best adblocker extension,Its incomprehensible
63229,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"since it‚Äôs so much like the app store, it almost reminds me of white door 5.1...? or 6.0 because it combined cydia and the app store. obviously that would be cool now (installer instead or choice of package manager) but idk how useful it‚Äôd be because of the lack of an untethered jailbreak"

15300,best tree for the garden,"Bonsai. My father has taken care of about 15 of them my entire life, and since they can outlive generations of families easily, I like to think he will continue to live on in them once he passes. I know after he is gone, there will be many days I spend out there, trimming the branches, having a nice chat with Dad. 

Edit: Im aware bonsai is a style, and that any type can become a bonsai tree. My dad doesn't just have 15 bonsais all of the same type, but I do agree it's important to be accurate. With that in mind, my favorite type would be the Californian Redwood Bonsai."
47380,best state to visit in the United States,Go to Boston! It's the heart of American independence. Home of the American revolution. Also very beautiful and historical.  The New England Patriots are Bostons NFL team and currently #1 in the NFL. It's very cold this time of year too.
