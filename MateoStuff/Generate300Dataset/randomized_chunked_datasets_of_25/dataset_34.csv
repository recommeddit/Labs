3464,"Yes lol, I meant to say solely rankings. 

I just don't think Brown, Columbia and Penn are different enough in prestige/ranking to use rankings. It's not like you're comparing Columbia and Chico State, where rankings would be helpful. 

And, yea it is a ranking but it would be dumb to use this to pick between Brown, Penn and Columbia too.",best college for research

22090,"I work at a studio lot in LA and I have my fair share of celebrity run ins but I dont get star struck (I work in the facilities side of the studio) the two nicest celebrities I've met are :

Clint Eastwood, super nice guy and literally looks like any old geezer on the streets. He talk to me for a bit, shared a few laughs and I shit you not he pulls a peanut out of his pocket and lowers his hand close to his foot and a squirrel came out of a bush to eat it out of his hand. This was right outside his office building and this is probably the favorite memory work on the lot.

Vanessa Hudgens, I was walking in a breezeway and a girl introduce herself as Vanessa and started to talk to me about my job on the lot. She was very nice but I didnt catch on who she was until I remember what production was going on in the sound stage nearby. I said Vanessa Hudgens and she confirmed laughing. I apologized and told her I'm not really the type to get caught in with celebrities but she was cool with it. She appreciated that I treated her like a normal person and I'm not a crazy fan. 


Met other celebrities but those two stood out the most to me.",best celebrity

73746,"To be honest, I think that the way it sounds is the least important criteria when it comes to writing. I initially wanted to record how they all sound, but I realised that all three that I’ve tried produce the same scratchy sound. The major difference is in the feedback that you get as you write on it. The Paperlike has a very subtle grip that you won’t notice if you scribbled over it, but if you start writing finer sentences on it, you’ll notice that you have a lot more control over the pencil.

It’s also a bit ‘softer’ than the other two that I’ve tried in a way that I don’t know how to explain. You know the difference between writing on a single sheet of paper over a hard surface versus writing on a stack of paper? The paperlike made it feel a lot more like the latter (perhaps not a stack, but three sheets instead of one). 

Also, I’m kinda more in the ‘no-screen protectors’ gang usually and I got a matte screen protector solely to improve the writing, so this aspect is really important to me.",best matte screen protector for ipad
