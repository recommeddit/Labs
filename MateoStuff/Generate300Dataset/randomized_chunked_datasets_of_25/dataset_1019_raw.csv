I had a snow cone that had a scoop of pineapple ice cream on the bottom and I've been looking for pineapple flavored ice cream ever since. Still haven't found it yet.
"I’ve never had good experiences with Home Depot. I’ve gone there for specific things like turned railing posts and they simply didn’t stock any where Lowe’s had several choices. 

Home Depot is also the only place where I had a store employee yell at me (a contractor) for saying “excuse me” after waiting through a good minute of his personal conversation with another employee. I just needed to use his pen to rough up some dimensions."
"brave browser,

1. its just a tiny bit harder to use but has some useful features built in
2. its faster than chrome and uses less ram,

3, they had a few problems but not privacy wise other than the tor one but normal users probably wouldnt use that feature,

4. im pretty sure you can do that, i dont really use bookmarks but its probably good

5. i dont know how fast chrome opens but on my old pc it took a bit longer for brave to start than firefox, with my current pc it takes less than 2 seconds for it to open and fully load.  


edit: im terrible at grammar"

Yes I have read several authors he mentioned. Anyone that has stood out to you? How do you check out his shelves on Goodreads? Obviously I need to figure out how to navigate that site better!
This is exactly what I said also if you decided to get rid of it you can sell it back for most of the money on eBay or something.
"A $25 small space heater I bought for my first winter in Montreal. Turns out many of my apartments had insufficient insulation, or just straight-up holes to the outside world through old doors etc. So that little space heater saved my life basically every night for 5 dark and cold Montreal winters."
Best: infinity war and Ant-man. Worst: iron man 2. My favorite even though I agree with criticisms of its quality: Endgame
"To be honest, I also assumed for a while that nano only has the functions mentioned in the bar. Only after reading the documentation ( originally because of the .nanorc file ) I realized that the editor is more powerful."
"Depends on your skill, equipment and experience, and of course the weather."
"Go back in time and watch Fight Club or The Matrix opening night.
  
Those were legit mind fucks on the initial viewing."
Here's some other word replacement apps. Herp Derp for YouTube and Alientube. The first one replaces YouTube comments entirely so if you ever forget that they are literally cancer to read it helps remind you. The latter one blends Reddit comments into the YouTube comments if the video has been linked on Reddit

On a serious note, I'd say either [Grand Illusions](http://www.youtube.com/user/henders007), which has some really cool things, or [NBF](http://www.youtube.com/user/henders007), which is kinda stupid but really fun."
"623 sources in review article. mega-mega-pwned.

Edit: for the record, this sort of reference counting is not usually considered valid, just so you know."
"Your example is contrived. It's not possible to target based on race among other things. It's explicitly against the ads targeting policy and if you had ever created a targeted ad you'd know that. Maybe do some research first? Could enforcement of policy be better? Sure, there are people working on it. So, no it's not in the business model and it's going to be fine without it.
Lobbying to prevent regulation? Did you research this too? What regulation are you talking about? What regulations would you like to see? Why do you think those regulations would make sense and/or are feasible? The only thing I've seen from regulation is that nowadays I have to click on accepting cookies for every website.
In your argument about equality, you are only looking at one side of the coin: the people being advertised to. What about opportunities for the advertisers? Why are you forcing advertisers to waste money? Increase their marketing budgets and putting up a barrier to entry for smaller operations while not hurting the big players?"
"Other than Endgame

How come no one has mentioned Butterfly Effect
"I like to make grits, bacon, eggs over easy, and biscuits that have bacon grease poured into the dough. Mix it all into one bowl and it's a like a Southern smoothie!

Shit, now I'm *really* hungry."
"No, his K/D is undefined. Can't divide by zero, after all."
It would be really cool if you could discuss the alleged connection between lymphoma and glyphosate. (I haven’t listened yet but intend to!)
Absolutely. Raiders is far and ahead the best of the series
"knock knock

"In my personal opinion they do racing spikes and racing flats very well. As far as trainers, I feel that other brands have outdistanced them."
