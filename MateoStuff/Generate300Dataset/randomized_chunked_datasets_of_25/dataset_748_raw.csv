"You mention the paint being altered by the underlying colors but forget that poster board is a totally different surface. The glossiness and texture of it alone will react differently to the paint and result in a completely different shade. Look up metamerism.

If you get the tootsie rolls and smarties, 5-6 pieces no problem. You will get the hand of it. Just remember, when you run out of candy, turn that light off."
"Agreed. PUBG has a slightly better Battle Royale IMO, but that’s just preference. I don’t have it on my phone anymore because the matches in any BR go too long for my free time. Both are good and have their own flavor though for sure."
None unless you are getting it for yourself. Otherwise you'll be here posting about how the triplets are bored with the pet and don't take care of it anymore in a couple months.
"I definitely wouldn't say superhero movies weren't a thing, just not to the level of today. The Michael Keaton Batman films and the Christopher Reeves superman films were both really popular."
