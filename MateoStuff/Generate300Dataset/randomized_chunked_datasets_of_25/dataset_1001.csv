Shakshuka looks awesome. It's bookmarked!

Edit: I'm a moron and read that wrong. Gruel is oatmeal mixed with leftover stew. We don't live together so I basically have to start from scratch, but I might try that at my place. I love making stew in the fall.",best breakfast foods

Overall there's better arcade races than realistic ones in the Switch.  Horizon Chase Turbo, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, Burnout: Paradise, Asphalt 9, Rise: Race The Future, Fast RMX.  Those are the best arcade racers on the Switch in my opinion (not in any particular order).",best car racing video game
