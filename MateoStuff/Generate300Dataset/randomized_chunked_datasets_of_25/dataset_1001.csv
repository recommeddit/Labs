32376,best hotel to live in,"I worked for a very wealthy man. and he didn't get any attention because the entourage of staff made sure everything was all ready to go, everywhere he went, before he even stepped of his Falcon7X.  To the outside looking in he's just some older grey haired shuffling through."
28966,best breakfast foods,"Ok so I know generally what gruel is from books. It's a type of porridge, but I've never tasted it. Is it like cream of wheat? Like Chinese rice porridge or like watery oatmeal?

Shakshuka looks awesome. It's bookmarked!

Edit: I'm a moron and read that wrong. Gruel is oatmeal mixed with leftover stew. We don't live together so I basically have to start from scratch, but I might try that at my place. I love making stew in the fall."
17063,best iOS game,Very addictive for sure! I’m still just getting into the combat as well as I wanted to get all the gathering and crafting skills leveled up first haha.
21470,best workout music,"That's how I use it honestly. It's a great supplement for stress relief, getting me thru a tough day at the office, or empowering me during my workout."
10589,best suitcase lock,">having no padlock will probably do a better job of discouraging petty theft

That's not how it works"
27761,best breakfast foods,"My dude. Look up the Clever Coffee Dripper. It's like $20 on Amazon and it uses standard coffee filters. I've been in the coffee biz for a decade, and this is the easiest way to brew coffee. The aeropress only makes 10oz, which isn't enough for me."
36524,best alcoholic drink,This isn't a real thing. It just can't be.
66522,best soccer team in the world,Surely Portugal should be above England?

6948,best iPhone,"Why the 3G? For its time it brought so much like 3G networking, faster speeds and a new design. Probably the 5C was the worst. Basically a skinned iPhone 5."
23855,best car racing video game,"Gear Club has customization but I found the load times too ridiculously long to get past to feel like playing the game.  I haven't tried GRID.

Overall there's better arcade races than realistic ones in the Switch.  Horizon Chase Turbo, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, Burnout: Paradise, Asphalt 9, Rise: Race The Future, Fast RMX.  Those are the best arcade racers on the Switch in my opinion (not in any particular order)."
27846,best breakfast foods,Hmmm...is that you Jack Johnson?
53681,best medicine for a cold,"OP you rock. I didn’t realize how few people do this (this = choose the right ingredients based on symptoms, not marketing) until I met my husband. In the UK they use weird little euphemisms like “chesty cough” and other shit like this so of course he never knew what to take. Now we run through his actual symptoms and I tell him what he needs (decongestant vs cough suppressant, etc)"
5752,best programming language for web development,"Difference between html and html5, and also CSS and CSS3? Also, if you learn html5 and CSS3, do you have to learn html and CSS?"
23288,best car racing video game,+1 for Horizon being the best-looking racing title. It's also probably the best all-around option in general as there's something for fans of every type of racing here. Except maybe NASCAR? Fuck NASCAR though.
27881,best breakfast foods,"I have oatmeal every morning.

I don't know if I enjoy it or if it's just become a habit from trying to eat healthy."
12109,best gifts for dad,LOMBARD - Lots Of Money But A Real Dickhead
9233,best toothpaste,"From what I've read, the ""9 out of 10 dentists recommend"" is because the survey isn't exclusive. The dentists were always allowed to select multiple brands - and most are like ""does it have flouride? then yes i'd recommend it"""
40888,best instrument to play,"Wow bro, nice"
