64430,"Ah, that makes sense!  Finally!  I grew up with NB in the 1980s, and the numbers did not make any sense whatsoever then.  There was a 420, a cushioned, neutral trainer.  Then there was a 620, another cushioned neutral trainer.  Then there was the 730, another cushioned, neutral trainer.  When they went to 990 and 1000+, the numbers only indicated price.  Then I had numerous pairs while running in college, and the numbers were all over the place.  500 something?  600 something?  I get racing flats, and all of a sudden it's the 200.  Then I get track spikes, and those are also the 200.  But now there's a new track spike, and it's the Comp 400?  Most recently, I had the Comp 205 and the Comp 330 racing flats, but now I see that racing flats are now 1300s.  Wait, that used to be the incredibly heavy trainer for chubby old men number!
