29677,best game console,What about the DOA series. From what I have heard they are actually pretty great fighting games. Minus the er... *plot*. Also I now you can't list all of them but JRPGs in general. Those are well worth the money of a ps3/ps4 if your into them.
9159,best toothpaste,Should be noted that Colgate total with triclosan is slightly better but may disrupt ecosystems as it is an antibacterial. Most important is brush technique.

34145,best NFL player,"Haha you might want to direct this towards TracyMorganFreeman, I was not the one to mention Hutson."
60142,best freezer brand,"Thanks for the suggestion. I actually found one that isn't that much more expensive: http://www.centralrestaurant.com/Arctic-Air-AF-23-Reach-In-Freezer-One-Door-230-Cu-Ft-5-frasl-8-HP-c94p27184.html

I still have quite a bit more research to do, but this is a great lead for me. I've been really frustrated by the planned obsolescence of pretty much every residential freezer I've looked at."

46585,best trick or treating candy,"Balls AND nuts? And they're both plural, implying that you have at least two of each.  But how do you tell your balls and your nuts apart?"
2501,best headphones,"If you can, spend the extra bit for the M50x. Having a detachable cord is soooo nice :) I have one for my desktop and use the other two that it comes with for my iphone."

Also you've definitely piqued my interest in the xm1, I'll be trying that one out for sure"
53308,best usb c charging cable,I see. Well why don't you just use a regular usb 3.0 to 3.0 cable and put your phone on like the dex hub station which I believe has a usb 3.0 port out. I might be mistaken as i do not own one but was considering to buy.
9304,best toothpaste,Thanks for the insight. What about the toothpaste with scope? I feel I need mouthwash and mint for fresh breathe .

67471,axios alternatives reddit,Thanks for the clarification. It makes sense now. Didn't know about the Cache API either. Will definitely check it out!
69023,best science fiction novel,Snow Craah is pretty good.
16707,best pet for toddlers,Not sure. I may have made an assumption based on your use of the word partner. I may have merged your thread and a different one.
414,best terminal file manager reddit,"Depends on what I’m doing. If I’m just moving a few files or opening images Thunar is my favorite for various reasons, mostly the defaults related to my uses. Nothing important or features that cannot be used on others. 

CLI for all else."
66676,best soccer team in the world,Same can be said for the Dutch twice (although at least they won the Euros)
62151,Best RPG game on PS4,I’ve played the beginning of a game called “Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch” it’s an RPG made in part with Studio Ghibi (if I’m not mistaken). It really gives you The studio Ghibi vibes from the hand drawn animated cutscenes and story. I’ve been looking for a copy for myself for sometime
64430,Best Nike running shoes,"Ah, that makes sense!  Finally!  I grew up with NB in the 1980s, and the numbers did not make any sense whatsoever then.  There was a 420, a cushioned, neutral trainer.  Then there was a 620, another cushioned neutral trainer.  Then there was the 730, another cushioned, neutral trainer.  When they went to 990 and 1000+, the numbers only indicated price.  Then I had numerous pairs while running in college, and the numbers were all over the place.  500 something?  600 something?  I get racing flats, and all of a sudden it's the 200.  Then I get track spikes, and those are also the 200.  But now there's a new track spike, and it's the Comp 400?  Most recently, I had the Comp 205 and the Comp 330 racing flats, but now I see that racing flats are now 1300s.  Wait, that used to be the incredibly heavy trainer for chubby old men number!  What's going on here?"
