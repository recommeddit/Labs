"Just out of curiousity, where did you grow up and was Halloween and trick or treating not that big of a deal?"
Thanks! My sisters are finally on speaking terms now so we can finally get a portrait done.
"Huh, I was under the impression that that was based on raw ratings by guild members... Is it 200 dummy votes?"
"i don't know the opening theme to Harry Potter, and thus have no idea."
"I appreciate you!! ðŸ¤ŸðŸ˜Ž

My experience with it was in Ariana and Evans soap and aftershave. Before I had to go back to go back to work (active duty Navy) i shaved my stubble and my GF at the time loved it too! Couldn't keep her out of my face ðŸ˜…"
My last one so the 7 Plus had it until April last year.
not sure why you got downvoted... heres an upvote for just puting yourself out there
"Now that Sears is basically out of business, where do you recommend?"
You can get rebound stuffiness though if you use it too long though.  I became dependent on it.
I loved reading books 1 and 2 as odd adventures and world building.  Book 3 felt the most aimless.  But book 4 is what ties everything together and reveals the wonderful intricacies of its puzzle.  It's  also a series that greatly rewards rereading.
"You make sweeping generalizations about Americans but then complain that America is too diverse. Which is it, are we all the same or are we too different?

Why do you think diversity is a bad thing?"
"The IT Crowd.  Assuming it's still on there, that is--I haven't checked in a while."
"None. Just smell clean. Most women I know don't like cologne on men...most men who wear it, wear too much."
"I'm not convinced Mars bars actually exist. I'm an American in my 30s and I've never seen one, not even a wrapper. Part of me kind of believes it's some elaborate prank, but I'm not sure who the intended target is."
"Yes! I think it's a pinoy product as well. In one of their updates the sample transaction was ""Payment to PLDT"""
"Can you export the PDF to OneNote? 
One note is designed for pen functionality. It would be easier to use.

Edit:
That's what I do with my lecture.
(The PDF contains 110 pages in total)"
"You are right, the overall experience at CP isn't what it used to be. It's WAY cleaner now, events are constantly going on, the food is improved, the employees speak english, and the water park is actually worth visiting now."
"I am throwing XCOM2 out there, feels like a strategy RPG"
+1
"When I was reccommended this series by a friend I read the first chapter.  The next day I told him that it was the most boring book thing I've ever read.  A few weeks later I picked it up again and drug my feet through the first 8 or so chapters.  Then it hooked me.  I couldn't put it down after that.  If you're not hooked by chapter ~10... I don't know what to say.  Give it a little more.

The chapters are short enough that its not a pain to read like some other books.  Its easy to pick up and put down.  Once you get into it a bit more, you'll begin to realize the organic writing style that Rothfuss has.  Quite pleasant on the brain."
"Really enjoyed both three-body trilogy, and fire upon the deep. Just sayin'.

EDIT: definitely read the full trilogy of three-body tho - unlike a lot of other sci-fi/fantasy epics, the creativity does not peter out at all in the later books. Consistently brilliant throughout."
