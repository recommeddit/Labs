That's really insightful.

"Drawboard PDF is still the best. OneNote is nice for note-taking and it's free, but it gets messy when you try to save the pdf again. Of course, you can always use Fill & Sign on Adobe Acrobat to annotate PDFs for free."
I assume he means mid-table aka average.
Going to Prague next week! Which bar?
I love that lo-fi clip they play for that. I laughed so hard during this video.
"WGU. 

Western Governor's University.  About 5000 a year - you can take as many classes as you want, just have to complete 12 units each 6 month. AWESOME one on one support by a dedicated mentor. All the materials are provided, including things like CBTnuggets, Boson test preps, lab simulators, etc. The books are electronic so I did buy a handful of books - especially for the Cisco.

I have gotten two promotions and tripled my salary since I started. Best thing I ever did.

I have a B.S. in IT with security emphasis. The finals for ALL of the IT classes are passing the certifications which are including in the tuition. I got credit for my existing A+, Security + and my AA in Networking from the local Tech College, so started as a Junior. (at age 52)
Walked away with a CCNA, CCNA Security, CompTIA Project +

and LPIC-1 / Linux + 2015


NSA CNSS 4011

The CIW certs aren't worth a lot but I learned a lot with them:


CIW Web Design Specialist
CIW Javascript Specialist
CIW Database Specialist"
"I use dired sometimes but do most operations with  orderless+consult+affe+embark. So slick, so easy, so fast."
Can add to this...all base materials bought at HD or Menard's...finishing fixtures at Lowes. But generally the Lowes by me is a wasteland.
This. Best digital card game (personal opinion). But def the most budget friendly
"I have quite a few that were just below these really, including some old classics like Death Note, which whilst great, have some flaws. These 10 currently stand out. Monogatari would take my #1 spot though, probably followed by Madoka.

Alphabetical order:

Attack on Titan  
Fate/Zero  
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  
Kill la Kill  
Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid  
Monogatari  
Overlord  
Madoka Magica  
Saga of Tanya the Evil  
Violet Evergarden"

"Syntax problems are not real problems.

90% of dev time is going to be spent thinking and designing solutions and 10% of it is going to be spent typing.

If one developer has to spend 15% of their time typing because they are brand new to a language and frequently have syntax issues they are not going to come out with a worse result. Any typing mistakes they make are going to be obvious and shouldn't even make it to a code review because the code straight up won't work if you don't use the correct syntax. Furthermore in a month of practice they won't be making those syntax issues anymore."
"It's only a ""wasted career"" because Brady and the Pats have ruined any ounce of nuance forever

"For me it would be:

"Ashraful? Because I did not consider the fall from grace but only ability. With more sense, he would not have done those things and be an ATG for Bd by now. Such a waste."
"George R. R. Martin

I was walking around at a convention a couple years ago, and saw him just ambling around. Being the ridiculous fan of both ASoIaF and Wild Cards that I am, I of course approached him and started talking to him. We ended up standing there for ten minutes or so, just standing in the aisle between two booths chatting about his various projects.

He has to get that kind of thing all the time (especially now that the TV show is so popular), but he was extremely friendly and seemed completely unhurried to end the conversation."
"I admit I'm not super familiar with all the formulations of kids' stuff, but I'm seeing stuff on the CVS website for ages 4 and up that contain dextromethorphan and guaifenesin.
 
There's actually some decent evidence out there for the efficacy of honey in children's cough, though."

"Hi, I recommend looking at my [gaming laptop list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/) instead of my general use laptop list. The Gigabyte Aorus 15P on my list, which happens to be on sale, is a decent choice. It has an RTX 3060 115W, which is not the highest wattage, but is still on the high side."
