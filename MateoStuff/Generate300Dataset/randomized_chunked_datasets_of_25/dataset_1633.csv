37586,"I predict a particular group of people is gonna look at this list and get triggered by it (particularly the top pick).

But the list itself looks ok though. Doesn't match my own exactly, but not a lot of really egregious stuff. I'd rank Infinity War noticeably higher, Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange somewhat higher, and Iron Man 3 somewhat lower, but that's pretty much it. I like your points system, it paints a pretty clear picture of the critical consensus on the 23 films.

Just for kicks, here's my ranking: 

1. Avengers: Endgame 
2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 
3. Avengers: Infinity War 
4. Black Panther 
5. Guardians of the Galaxy 
6. Marvel's The Avengers 
7. Thor: Ragnarok 
8. Captain America: Civil War 
9. Iron Man 
10. Spider-Man: Far From Home 
11. Spider-Man: Homecoming 
12. Captain Marvel 
13. Doctor Strange 
14. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 
15. Captain America: The First Avenger 
16. Ant-Man and the Wasp 
17. Ant-Man 
18. Avengers: Age of Ultron 
19. Iron Man 3 
20. Thor 
21. Iron Man 2 
22. Thor: The Dark World 
23. The Incredible Hulk",best Marvel movie

31902,"The one downside to hotel living is that when the wifi bogs down because everyone is viewing porn or streaming netflix, you can't do anything about it, usually 4 pm in the afternoon to about 11 pm at night. I moved to a medium sized city in the US (Reno) and have stayed at a motel for longer than I thought, as I am in the process of buying a house, and its like $900 a month, no kitchen, although I have a hotplate (my own), microwave and a half-size refrigerator.  One brainiac brought in a propane camp stove and blew up his room (probably to cook a batch of meth, we guess). Back in the day, it was easier to get a kitchenette, but high insurance rates have made a lot of hotel owners remove the stoves and such. I discussed having my own direct internet cable put in, but the owner didn't want to mess with that. I worked years in construction and have stayed months/years at hotels and usually its a matter of asking when you check in for long term rates.",best hotel to live in

I've watched so many reviews but I'm lost on what keeps people interested about it. A game of Betrayal at House on the Hill, or Pandemic kept people much more engaged. Personally I also like Azul, but I can't tell if I'm the only one, yet.",best board games
