"but how much cricket did they play in those days and how many good teams were around? No South africa, Sri Lanka were weak, India werent as strong, It was only England, Australia and Pakistan."
"Are people supposed to be posting spoilers in threads titled ""books you should read""? Doesn't seem like a very bright idea. Just a thought. Not saying OP has, but some other folks have."
It didn't during my testing.
"I have a dual-degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering. If I went back, I'd probably just get the aero degree. I would then have time a few more aero classes, which were the ones I enjoyed most. Maybe one day I'll go back for a masters.."
"This managed to straddle the line between hilarious and deeply touching, definitely one of the best on there. Patton Oswalt's latest special had a similar thing going for it too."

"if you want to maximize anonimity and privacy i would use 2 browsers. one for logging into personal accounts and sensitive info, and one for only browsing and then wiping your data after you close it (duckduckgo is made for this). But if you dont care about privacy at all, test different ones, check out reviews, forums about certain browsers and just stick to the one you like. firefox and brave seem to be the best for privacy, but brave recently had a scandal with data selling which is obviously something to consider. opera is a cool web browser but dont use it they sell your data lol. vivaldi seems to have cool features and they dont sell your data since they are a very small team. ive never searched/used edge enough to tell you about it."

"That makes me wonder; what's the downside? It sounds so good that there's just no reason to buy a regular decent vacuum, as they're hardly much cheaper."
"Playing a few good games on an old console is much better than owning a dozen mediocre games on a new console,it would be just better graphics not really important, it's a good thing you got games that you enjoy."
Disappointment
I’ll be coming back at you with something new.... or old....
"I prefer my local shop, Harville Hardware, if I'm looking to buy a quality piece of equipment. If I need something for a quick repair, ACE Hardware. If I need general construction stuff that ACE doesn't carry, Home Depot. If I'm looking for finish grade stuff, Lowes."
When you do receive and review it could you compare the clicks and buttons as well? I've been curious since they switched off ttc and people claim the 10/20mil omrons feel crispier than the 50m
