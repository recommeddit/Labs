Nope sadly not. The developer is working with someone new to do the port. So I guess a lot of knowledge transfer is happening. Should hopefully speed up future updates
USmobile and others will send out a sim for free generally
"I just found it really awkward to place the phone on my setup without looking up, which I won’t do!"
"I absolutely loved Radiance (finished it last week) and I'm currently on an Amy Harmon re-read binge. Harmon's stories are so different, from fantasy to historical and contemporary, and they're so, so good."
Rock Bottom is probably my favorite Em track tbh
"The battle of [Khalkhin Gol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol) - Japan and the USSR fought the largest pre-WW2 tank battle, fought on the Mongolian steppes (of all places).  Soviet victory convinced Japan to try to expand southwards, to the Pacific, instead of north to Siberia."
Because they hate their families. They use colgate themselves.
Ever try to talk into a gorge? It's gonna be like that.
Ubuntu or Mint are both good choices. I personally used ubuntu for all my university studies.
How does installling zebra work? Just add the above repo and install through cydia? Will my repos and packages port over?
Why am I not surprised
I will check that one out!

Japan I'm guessing?
"At the Kotla. Yes. Other places, not so sure."
"Ummm I need to pick you or your sisters brain. I get this 3-4 times a year for like 2-3 weeks. I was told by the doctor I get post nasal drip and have a deviated septum.

1) I'm surprised to see this here because I thought most people only get a cold, and it usually only progresses to sinus infection due to poor drainage, is that correct?

2) Does an anti histamine almost always work for cold purposes? Because when I take claritin and such for allergies (allegra, all of them I've tried), they do almost nothing. 

3) For people like us, does it always reach stage 4 with a chest infection? I've been at stage 3 on and off for about 2 weeks. One day I'll barely be coughing, another night a cough keeps me up til 3am. 

4) Wouldn't an antihistamine stop stage 3 (taking delsym) since it stops music production? What is delsym, just cough medicine (cough suppressant?) Wouldn't both work?"
"My mom loves Almond Joy, and I would always give her mine after I went Trick-or-Treating! I was trying to clamor for the ""favorite child"" spot :D"
"I’ve been on all the non-kiddie coasters except Apocalypse (though I haven’t done Revolution since pre-makeover, and the ones I have done were spread out over 3 visits from 2010 to 2017). Here’s my ranking...I think:

*Tier 1: Awesome*

T1. Twisted Colossus

T1. X2

3. Tatsu

4. Full Throttle

5. Superman

*Tier 2: Solid*

6. Batman

7. Goliath

8. Scream

*Tier 3: OK*

9. Ninja (would like to ride it again though)

10. Revolution (probably better post-refurb)

*Tier 4: Wouldn’t Recommend*

11. Riddler’s Revenge (probably would’ve rated it higher if I hadn’t been worried the whole ride as my seat kept popping up notches...)

12. Viper (ouch...would like to try again though)

13. Goldrusher (just odd, not comfortable as a single rider)

14. Green Lantern (lots of forward/backward body tossing...it’s like a mild car accident)"
"I just watched a film called Extracted which was a bit of a mind fuck. I'd also suggest Mr. Nobody. It's a little artsy but there is some real depth to it, a very thought provoking film. Primer is probably the pinnacle of mind fuck movies."
"Mine has been doing exactly that.  I'll knock out a couple others first, but I've resolved that I'm gonna end up playing it solo."

I'm almost embarrassed to ask but what is RWRB?
"{{The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery}} is my go-to recommendation. I love it so much! 
{{Katherine by Anya Seaton}} is also another favorite."
