46399,best trick or treating candy,"I usually give two pieces per kid. Just drop it in their bag (or else they'll start to get picky. They can always trade with friends/family later). I would buy a bit more candy since I tend to munch on it between waves of kids. Definitely lights on. I usually sit out on the stoop until I run out of candy because otherwise I would be getting up every five seconds. Little kids might start a bit earlier than 5pm, just keep going until you run out of candy. When you run out of candy, you put a sign on your door ""Out of candy :("" and keep an eye on the window. Have fun!"
33705,best electric car,"I'd been looking into a Bolt for a while before the Kona actually. I wasn't a fan of the funky shape and plastic interior but on paper it's still good. It kind of became a victim of what happened with the Kona which soured me on buying an EV for the short term. Too little car for too much money. I decided I'd go in a different direction for a replacement daily driver (*way* different direction; I got a CPO BMW M4) and revisit the EV market in a few years when there should be several more options to give better choices as well as keep the prices from getting stupid. 

The Model 3 or any other Tesla I'm just not interested in. Too many common QA issues, too sparse of a service network, and I just don't have enough faith in the company."
47636,best state to visit in the United States,Or Red River Gorge/Natural Bridge :)
30191,best Mexican war to study,My memory from learning about in Florida is essentially just “America wanted more land out West so they took it and the Mexicans put up a bad fight.” We didn’t get super in depth past that
34125,best NFL player,I agree about Lawrence Taylor. He really made left tackles an important aspect of the game.
33570,best electric car,"I just got one updoot for saying the illuminated logo on the ID4 was awful!

I think you're taking this too seriously."
31470,best hotel to live in,"Cosmopolitan in Vegas. Three words: Japanese Soaking Tub.

It overlooks the Bellagio fountain. Wife and I had champagne in there and barely left the room the whole trip. Plus customer service is bonkers there, and the best burger I've ever had was at the Henry in the lobby."
41950,movies like Inception,"You want go crazy mind bender? How about time crimes
Primer
Mulholland drive
Memento
Triangle"
33774,best electric car,"For a dedicated-daily they sound absolutely perfect; peak torque at a dead stop, nearly-silent, no shifting... they're just so darned simple to operate, and their silence really helps them ""fade into the background"" as you drive. In a daily, I think that's ideal.

For a fun car I want to be engaged, to feel the trans beneath my fingers and hear the engine in my ears, but when I literally *just* want to get from A to B, nothing more? EV's are practically built for that."
44159,best items under $100,"One of those alarm clocks that turn a lamp gradually brighter, instead of waking you up by brute force. Because of that thing, I no longer hate mornings, so now I have spare hate for more deserving things, such as the corner of my nightstand. Good times."
63351,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Awesome list! There are several tweaks I never knew about and will have to try them out. I also saved this post so I can link it when someone asks ""what tweaks do I install?"""
28820,best breakfast foods,"Sounds good at first, but I personally prefer making one big casserole and just cutting into squares.  Muffin tins just add more complication and oven space for little benefit in my opinion."
29518,best game console,"I guess op is not fan of Racing games


Gran Turismo, Forza, Project Gotham Racing 4, Midnight Club LA and Motorstorm deserve a spot on your list"
19812,best workout music,Itgoesitgoesitgoesitgoesitgoesitgoesitgoesitgoesitgoes
566,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"I just tried OneNote. It didn't want to open my ePub file, and the PDF file had to be printed to it and turned into a glorified screenshot. So I could draw on it but couldn't select or search text.

Evernote can embed the PDFs, but I can't seem to use the drawing tool directly on the pdf. All of my drawings end up outside of it.

Haven't tried Digital Editions with the drawing tablet yet."
36629,best alcoholic drink,"This used to be the drink of choice around my dorm room for a while freshman year. Absolutely delicious.

Sorry about your uncle. ALS is an awful disease."
20488,best workout music,"Yes! I used to listen to this before I took Organic Chem tests in college. Just try not to punch the air during the ""fight til you drop"" part..."
6827,best iPhone,"XS max for me. it was the first year since 2013 that I didn’t do a yearly upgrade and although the battery is starting to run down, this phone is a beast. great screen, super snappy, camera still holds up. so much to like here"
5354,best home improvement store,"www.discountfurnacefilter.com

It's exactly what you'd expect. Always been fast and cheaper than Amazon for those with specialty furnace filter needs."
54854,best water filter,"Didn't intend for that to come out as a sales pitch, merely pointing out that portable filters that make contaminated water safe to drink *do* exist.

As I mentioned before, I'm not one of the scientists that works on these things, so I don't really know the details of how the system works, only that a cartridge filled with polystyrene beads that have been infused with halogens are able to ionically kill bacteria and viruses that pass through it.

4447,best text editor,What ide's do you consider fast?
38150,best Marvel movie,I like Captain Marvel because it's fun to watch Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson hang out. The Dark World is un-fun sludge.
54035,best medicine for a cold,It's pretty crazy when you have a big thick stream of mucus that reaches from your nose all the way to the shower floor and just sort of hangs there as you breathe in through your mouth to give it another blow.  Very satisfying.
8586,best toothpaste,"~~I believe the last time I saw a question like this is /r/askscience, the conclusion was that extra saliva is bad for your teeth.~~

From what I see on Google, the higher pH of saliva helps neutralize the acid produced by bacteria.  Since I can't remember the thread in /r/askscience where I saw that, I'll retract my comment."
36041,best alcoholic drink,Diet orange soda and clear rum.   Tastes like a push pop about 45 calories per drink.
