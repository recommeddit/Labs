46399,"I usually give two pieces per kid. Just drop it in their bag (or else they'll start to get picky. They can always trade with friends/family later). I would buy a bit more candy since I tend to munch on it between waves of kids. Definitely lights on. I usually sit out on the stoop until I run out of candy because otherwise I would be getting up every five seconds. Little kids might start a bit earlier than 5pm, just keep going until you run out of candy. When you run out of candy, you put a sign on your door ""Out of candy :("" and keep an eye on the window. Have fun!",best trick or treating candy
33705,"I'd been looking into a Bolt for a while before the Kona actually. I wasn't a fan of the funky shape and plastic interior but on paper it's still good. It kind of became a victim of what happened with the Kona which soured me on buying an EV for the short term. Too little car for too much money. I decided I'd go in a different direction for a replacement daily driver (*way* different direction; I got a CPO BMW M4) and revisit the EV market in a few years when there should be several more options to give better choices as well as keep the prices from getting stupid. 

The Model 3 or any other Tesla I'm just not interested in. Too many common QA issues, too sparse of a service network, and I just don't have enough faith in the company.",best electric car

For a fun car I want to be engaged, to feel the trans beneath my fingers and hear the engine in my ears, but when I literally *just* want to get from A to B, nothing more? EV's are practically built for that.",best electric car

As I mentioned before, I'm not one of the scientists that works on these things, so I don't really know the details of how the system works, only that a cartridge filled with polystyrene beads that have been infused with halogens are able to ionically kill bacteria and viruses that pass through it.
