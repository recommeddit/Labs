I would disown my kids if they got me a card. They know I think cards are a waste of money. I'd rather they just say Happy Father's Day. And spend the $4 on candy bar.
"Although it isn't Science Fiction, First Man reminded me a lot of Interstellar."
Identity with John Cusack and Amanda Peet.
Memento is pretty great too
catnip: not even once.
agreed... I adored TDU1 on hardcore mode so much. TDU2 as a huge let down and the reason why I never preorder games anymore.
Great choice. Some days I wish I actually minored/doubled in CS. It’s so relevant for Psychology right now.
I have the Mophie one and I am liking it

"To be more specific, here are the highest paid undergrad degrees:

1. Comp Sci / Software Engineering
2. Electrical Engineering
3. Petroleum Engineering
4. Mechanical Engineering
5. Industrial Engineering

Of those, only comp sci / software engineering isn't extremely heavy on math.  And you still need to be able to do some math to get through the program, plus to be any good at it you need to be able to think *very* logically.

Law / Business yea, but that's not undergrad.  Law is getting crowded, yes.  If you go to a good regional school and get top 10% or so in your class you'll do fine.  But that's not undergrad.  So, same concern as psych there, that you'd need more schooling (professional school not grad school, but same deal)."
"It's because you smell like their dad. 

I guarantee it."
Is CPA included in accounting?I wanna do that.
"So, games that were better on console?
Dark Souls, The keyboard controls are unchangable and bad, 'end' is the pause/back key.
The game is locked at 30 fps and 720p by default, requires a mod to change
The game has awful multiplayer because GFWL works as well as a tampon made from crayons"
Best was the OG SE.
"2nd the expensive part, but worth it.  Paid $200 for a pair of 580G Blackfins 10 years ago.  Rubber on the frames wore out once, they sent me a brand new pair.  Still rock them everyday.  Not a part of Luxotica to my knowledge."
"Yeah, you have to prestige three times though before it unlocks."
I'd say that it counts
Honestly? If Simeone is able to teach young kids then Atletico. Real seem to be losing their grip and Barca needs younger players since Messi sadly can't play forever.
I think he's talking about east Sweden.
Hugs are definitely underrated!
"And I thought I was a case addict! 
I can’t seem to find the smart devil cases! Which site did you find them on?"
"Or just use a spoonful of Honey. It's cheaper and you can use it on your yogurt. Honestly, my first go to for my own cold symptoms is honey. I always give it a shot before ai break out the sudefed."
