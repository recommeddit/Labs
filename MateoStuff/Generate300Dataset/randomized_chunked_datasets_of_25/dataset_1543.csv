16794,"> She hates seeing our child play alone... having trouble having another child and as much as we try to always keep him company, its hard to do so every minute we are home.

That is an AWFUL reason to get a dog and you definitely should not get one.

If you get a dog it should be because you love dogs and want to spend time with a dog. A dog is not a playmate for your child. A lot of dogs dislike or barely tolerate children. Even dogs that love kids should *never* be allowed to play with a small child unsupervised.

You and your wife are obviously not actually interested in *having a dog*, just in providing a playmate for your child. This is incredibly obvious. I'm sure you'd do your best to take proper care of the dog, but this is just not a good situation for one.",best pet for toddlers

I can a lot of other films that are far superior to Shang-Chi (Infinity War, Guardians 1, Winter Soldier, Black Panther). I'm not saying it's terrible at all, but it does feel like an overreaction.

9092,">Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.

Holy shit. Are you serious? My parents programmed me to go for 5 minutes. I thank them.

Edit: by programmed I mean they had a 2.5 minute sand timer and I had to brush for the length of the timer on tops and then flip the timer over for bottoms. After years, I didn't really need the timer and by muscle memory it just felt ""right"" after so long. It stills feels odd if I have to rush and don't brush long enough.",best toothpaste

I've got balance, budget, cash flow non monthly expenses, and past years budgets all in one spreadsheet and I have formulas set up so if I put something into the budget it adds it automatically into expenses in cash flow and all sorts of stuff. It does require effort to start and some basic knowledge of Excel but I really do think it keeps me more organized then an app",best money managing app

There are some days I'll do that, too, when I'm running around with my daughter because that's how toddlers like to eat haha... little snacks all day long. My younger brother has always eaten that way, too.
 
Eating patterns can be pretty flexible. If I've got a lot of work to do on a given day, I usually just won't eat until dinner. If I'm doing some running around (usually on weekends), I'll get some lunch with my daughter or a few snacks here and there.",best breakfast foods
