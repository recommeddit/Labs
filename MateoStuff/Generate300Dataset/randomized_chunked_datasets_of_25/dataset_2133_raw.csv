Thanks a ton btw"

"I just got mine in the mail today. I have yet to power it on and set it up. 

But let me tell you this, the build quality feels fucking fantastic. People complaining about this computer having low build quality are nothing but snobs. If it isn’t built by titanium, the haters don’t like it. The computer feels very good."

"To be fair, I don't think there was a battle frontier in ruby and sapphire either."
"Same. Studying engineering and in grad school now. While I research a bunch of cool fundamental physics related stuff in my field, it's not the same as studying space time. However, I'm not naturally gifted at math-let alone advanced math, but am at other skills applicable to the field I'm studying. 

If you're still an undergrad and think you could do well at astrophysics you definitely still have time to switch. If you go to grad school in another subject it will become almost impossible to change after that or at least the time/money commitment will be hard to justify"
"> If you want to argue purely semantics, you are basically playing a role in every game.

Role-playing game has a specific meaning though. It refers to D&D style games and the video games that have been adapted in that style."
"Scrolled trying to find if anyone said euphonium. 

In my opinion, euphonium is an instrument that can easily be picked up as a first brass instrument. The mouthpiece size is a sweet spot for a beginner brass player, and a typical student model only has 3 valves. In elementary school, I started as a trumpet player, and cried every day for the first week. Euphonium was the perfect switch for me. It can read treble or bass clef, and the fingerings are relatively simple.

Euphonium models vary in what size mouthpiece they accept. Beginner models primarily use small shank while professional models use medium (european), and large shank. The second two (especially large) are much less forgiving for a beginning musician as they require a large amount of air to make a good sound.

Baritone and Euphonium get used interchangeably, however they are different instruments. A baritone has a bell more similar to a trombone (cylindrical), while euphonium has a bell that has a more gradual growth to it like a tuba (conical). The american style Euphonium has a forward facing bell, and is often mistaken for a baritone.

Student model euphoniums can be had for relatively cheap, and many find it easy to make a sound on it. When you first start off, your tone is pretty trombone like, but eventually progresses to a full rich sound that is sought after as a euphonium player. Yamahas are a safe bet as quality control is consistent with the horns. The YEP 201 has 3 valves, and the 321 has 4. Both take a small shank mouthpiece, and don't require too much air.

I mentioned it a little bit above, but getting a sound is pretty easy on Euphonium. However the idea of instant tone is frustrating to me. Some people assume that the instrument takes no skill to become proficient at. Proper air support is needed, and you have to listen to someone to understand what to look for in your tone as a euphonium player. You fill a unique role in the band where you might be holding it down with the other low brass, and then a few measures later, you're playing a running line with the woodwinds.

Euphonium is rarely found outside of the wind band setting, but it does make an appearance in orchestra pieces. Gustav Holst wrote for Tenor Tuba in the Planets Suite, and the solo in Mars gives me chills every time. You can also find euphonium in jazz. Rich Matteson is one of the greatest musicians I've ever heard. He was able to prove that the instrument has a voice outside of the standard concert band environment.

One of the downsides (I see this as a perk haha) is that not many people know what this instrument is. I've been called a tuba (Euphonium is part of the tuba family as the tenor tuba), french horn, saxophone,  and trombone. It's a nice conversation starter as a lot of people are curious about what it actually is.

This is my 9th year on the instrument, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. It's very rewarding to learn, and quite forgiving for a beginning musician."
"Hi!   

It seems like you might be looking for books and/or documentaries. Did you know we have a extensive **[reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)** in our wiki? It covers a wide array of subjects and also includes online documentaries and podcasts. It might be worthwhile to check it out!

If the reading list does not include the material you are looking for, we do hope that someone will be able to make a good suggestion in this thread! If it turns out to be an awesome suggestion, we would love to hear about it so we can include it in the reading list!

"It depends on your kids: are your kids good with dogs? Can they be trusted not to be screaming at them, punching them, grabbing ears, poking them in the eyes, riding on them, etc?

Kids need training just as much as dogs, and you can't get a dog and think that all will be sunshine and unicorns, regardless of what sort of dog you get. 

Kids under the age of three are usually not good with dogs, and need to be constantly watched, if they are interacting with the family dog. By about five or so, kids more or less understand, ""don't be a jerk to the dog"", but still need to be watched. 

One of the big reasons why dogs fail in a home with kids is that the parent assumes that the dog will tolerate all sorts of crap from kids, and the dog can't or won't...and turns around and nails a kid. 

The reason why I'm so strong on this is that I have known dogs who were PTS because the parents did not enforce any rules of engagement with the family dog for the kids, and the kids acted like kids will if not told otherwise, and the dog bit a kid. 

So yeah, if you get a dog, the dog is for the adults in the home, who have to keep an eye on things, and train the dog and the kids. 

People often will tell other people that retriever breeds are good with kids: they are also very oral dogs, and will happily bite a kid who is doing something they think should stop, or grab something from the kid, or go thru the house and pick up the kid's favorite toy and destroy it. So there's that..."
