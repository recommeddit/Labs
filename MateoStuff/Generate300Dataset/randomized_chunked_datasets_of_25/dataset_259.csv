58738,best cologne,"I do not recommend this, for all the reasons I described.  
HOWEVER, if you or anyone else really wants to do this because you like the idea, it is ok, as long as you realize that you won't be getting the benefits of a permanent association. None of them will be ""your"" smell. You will be treating fragrance more like an accessory, rather than a foundation. If you are ok with this, then it's fine. Not being sarcastic at all. Like I said above, I try not to be a snob about it. It's not taboo, or anything like that."
51151,best rap album,"I'd encourage everyone to read the descriptions of the albums.  Poor English abounds, but every once in a while you'll get gold like the description for Kendrick's GKMC: ""The East Coast rapper's first big budget album...""

Also: ""Dr. Dre - 2001 (2001)""

ALSO: Tribe's ""bonafide party classic 'Can You Kick It?'"""

43227,best detective show,Mr. Robot really fits the same tone as True Detective Season 1. The main character is a drug-addict and really nihilistic and condescending in the same vein as Rust.

16353,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'm a reasonably serious sunglass/eyeglass collector, so I'd say I know something about sunglasses. 

There is nothing wrong with most Luxottica brands, and quality and finishing ranges tremendously within the conglomerate. I wouldn't hesitate to buy Persols, Pradas or Oakleys as everyday sunglass if they suit your style. People like to join in the anti-Luxottica circlejerk and group these brands together because they are uninformed and think that quality sunglasses would suddenly become available at gas station prices if Luxottica didn't exist. They wouldn't, and the numerous independent sunglass manufacturers out there that charge similar or greater prices for their sunglasses is evidence of that."

54776,best water filter,"[Spectrapure RO/DI refurbished](http://spectrapure.com/Refurbished-90-GPD-RODI-System) for $124. Is a hit among coral reef keepers, produces absolutely clean water for demanding reef tanks. Easy to bypass the DI portion of it to produce water for human/animal consumption. This is what I do: RO/DI for reef tank, RO for humans/animals.

TDS(total dissolved solids) meter reads 360-400 ppm(parts per million) tap water, 10ppm after RO and 0ppm after RO/DI."
