if you want streaming+gaming i think the 10850K is your best option right now unless you can find the 5800 for cheaper.
It's anything but a truck. Can't tow any appreciable weight any reasonable distance. Short bed.
I love her for debunking hacks!
"Zero Water for me, but filtered water is indeed tight"
"Bakuba eco-hotel in Toliara, on the west coast of Madagascar. 

Eco hotel off the beaten track on a remote beach near local fishing villages. You could walk down from the hotel to the sea and completely pure white sand beaches. 

Designed by a french architect and his wife with gorgeous uniquely themed rooms using African furniture and textiles. The whole building was sculpted like a rock garden/the Flintstones, and ran off renewable power. There were only three guest rooms. The patio looked out onto the strait of Mozambique and I watched the sunset over the ocean from the pool on the deck. Also, French-trained chef. Also, spa and massage tower."
"The OP claims to already know at least some Python so why start over with PHP, which is brain-damaged and next to useless off the server?"
Great show. Would def recommend this one!
"Nothing like old school.

Get your self some chicken crap. Works wonders.

(1 out of 10 agrees.)"
"Don't forget Menards. There has been times I was needing something that I could not find at Lowes or Home Depot, but Menards carried it."
"Best: The Winter Soldier

Worst: The Incredible Hulk"
That would be amazing!
I can vouch for Kimâ€™s and Derry Girls both are awesome
"Oh, I find the USNWR ratings to be one of the worst things about the whole college industry (disclosure, went to Cal awhile back)"
Binary trees.

I don't think there's a single good one. Finder on Mac has columns. Ranger has them but is text-only.
"Hey efficientfalcon, great tip! This one appears on the long list at number 66 =)"
"Shawn White.  When I was a snowboarding instructor, my boss used to work at The Burton Academy.  It was common for famous riders to take the lift and talk to other visitors, Shawn would have the whole park closed and taken up by snowmobile.

Worst story I heard was when his manager booked a whole day for him to snowboard with kids from the make-a-wish foundation.  He rode with a couple in the morning and then ditched to go ride the half pipe.  He can't apologize to those kids because they're dead"
"Dental student here, generally its recommended for people to use soft bristles because its not only softer for the gums, but more so to avoid damage to the layer of enamel on teeth. 

You should look up ""Abrasion cavities"" on Google and check out the images. That sort of damage is exacerbated using a hard bristled-toothbrush."
"Oldie but goodie (we used this in punch bowls for college parties because it's cheap and tastes good, but be warned, it'll fuck you up). One fifth of cheap vodka,  two big bottles of Old English (or similar malt beverage... mostly for the carbonation) and a can of frozen strawberry lemonade concentrate. Let the concentrate unfreeze, mix all ingredients in a punch bowl. Boom! Super strong, fruity, fizzy, tastes like juice. Be warned, people will guzzle and puke."
"Thank you for these recommendations. I just read a CNET article about the Asus and it says that there is no 3.5mm audio jack, which is a bit annoying since I like to use bookshelf speakers on my desk.

The reviews online for this laptop are not stellar, which is surprising for a $1,000 laptop"
"Fun game, but they really push the iaps."
The iPhone 4 was my first true smartphone that I truly enjoyed using (the Samsung Continuum was buggy and slow). Then I moved to the iPhone 6 which is still my favorite phone. Currently using a Pixel 2 XL since 18' but I'm super excited for the iPhone 12.
"Ahhh! This is a really really great point, and something I never would have considered.  Thanks!!"
"> you should visit the Smithsonian museums

Yes, there is more than one Smithsonian museum in Washington DC and they are all amazing. 

And after people have gawked at the Hope Diamond (or dinosaur bones) in the Natural History museum, I'd recommend a trip to the incredible Freer and Sackler Galleries or to the Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, not just the one in downtown DC."
