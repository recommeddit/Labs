Now that I'm older, I realize that little me was an ass who didn't realize that my family wasn't that well-off to be able to afford $20 legoes.

Not sure if your mum was like that, but just wanted to share in case this was so.",best gifts for dad

32386,"As part of our training as bellman we are to ask open ended questions to the children to make sure they aren't being used for sex trafficking when bringing in luggage to ""Dad and daughter"" types. My dad works in security in the same hotel so he often gives me a heads up if the guest with the child is already under suspicion regarding their behavior at the front desk for check in. 
It rarely happens but hotels are the breeding grounds for sex traffickers.

This blew up! Thank you for the rewards to those that found my insight helpful. 

The questions vary depending amount of information security and the front desk tells the crew. 

Has this guest ever stayed with us or any other of our different umbrella hotels? 

What events are currently going on in the hotel? 
Was the child uncomfortable upon entry? (Looking down, crying, silent, dirty clothing). 

Lines of questions try to get the child to speak in general, as many traffickers take in children that don't speak English. 
Otherwise questions about their stay get directed at the child instead of the guardian. 
""What adventures are you guys up to here in Chicago?""
""Is your DAD here on business?""
We crouch and say if they would like to help the bellman work. Most kids love the experience. We usually crouch down and try to make eye contact. 
If I can't definitively tell security that the child is 100% comfortable in their surrounding, or if the guardian tries to lead the child away from me deliberately security gets an internal investigation going.

My dad has given me confirmations of arrests made of guests that I had attended to. Summer is a hectic season, and it happens more than you would like.",best hotel to live in
