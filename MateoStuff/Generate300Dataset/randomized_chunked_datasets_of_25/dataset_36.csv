17129,best iOS game,"It‚Äôs not playable in the Americas but it is in Europe, Oceania and some parts of Asia. I live in Mexico, and downloaded the game with a VPN set to London. 

The game plays like a wonder on iPad Pro but I stopped playing because it doesn‚Äôt have role queue yet, and even after ranking up to Emerald, match after match there was always 3 DPS, or last person to choose went Ahri or some shit instead of the jungle we needed, then it was a shower of ‚ÄùRetreat!"" pings, Turkish cuss words, and it culminated with someone going AFK or feeding 0-22.

There‚Äôs a slim chance that when it‚Äôs released here next month we‚Äôll have role queue but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath."
