37163,best amusement park,"Nah bro I just disagree. There has been a pretty big shift in the past several years evident in the changes and new marketing. And especially since they just specifically said the focus will be on 'guest experience.' 

Also all parks want to sell fast passes. CP is just annoying cause it's so flippin busy."

67918,best science fiction novel,"I assume, then, that you have given Ilium and Olympos a try? Awesome entrances, again, from Simmons."
6648,best iPhone,"That's cool but it's not all about security updates. With each Android version comes a new API and eventually developers stop supporting the old versions or getting a degraded experience. So your apps stop working.

That still doesn't match Apple's support with full feature updates which doesn't match the standard on desktop operating systems. 10+ year old hardware can run the latest versions of Windows and Mac perfectly fine."
15519,best tree for the garden,"Oh my God, I must have used that word in a wrong way. English is not my native language. What should I replace it with? I meant that you don't have a land currently, just imagine if you did."
37332,best amusement park,Never heard of it. I guess Washington is pretending they haven't either
47682,best state to visit in the United States,Don't forget pinnacle mountain.
60832,Best comedy show on Netflix,Adam Sandler
68661,best science fiction novel,It existed as a web novel before that.  He'd do a chapter at a time and post them up.  I heard about the book because of the movie though.
57091,best water brand,It drives me crazy. I don't want to drink velvet.
63,best terminal file manager reddit,`ranger`
54132,best medicine for a cold,Zicam. That shit kicks ass. Plus there's different kinds for whatever symptoms you have.
26814,best board games,"I am right there with you. 

I played with a group for a few years. It had moments of fun, but while I enjoyed spending time with those PEOPLE, I don’t think I really enjoyed the game much. It felt so samey EVERY time. And if it didn’t, those were rare. The setup SUCKED and the lore/campaign was really poorly done. 

I think it is a fine game with lots of content and some fun puzzles to solve, but not 27-30 3-hour-plays of said fun."
70666,best movies with a cool twist,"Unfortunately they literally marketed the movie as having ""THE BIGGEST TWIST IN YEARS"" and it wasn't hard to see coming from literally the first scene if you were expecting it."

51442,best iphone case,Any cases for the 13 pro max where it has the button opened like in my apples silicone 11 pro max case?
57666,best cologne,I’m surprised the classic PUA answer of “no cologne” hasn’t shown up here.
62523,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you’re into first person games with RPG elements, try Dying Light with the Following. A lot of game, a lot of player customization, and probably the best zombie game that I have played (I was too sick of Uncharted to get into the Last of Us). The only caution is a weak story."
46471,best trick or treating candy,"""Now I have to redial the internet. Hello. Operator? dot dot DOT dot Dot Dot DOT. Fluu... eeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEE."""
