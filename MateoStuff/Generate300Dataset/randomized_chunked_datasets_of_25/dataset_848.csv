30197,best Mexican war to study,"Outside of the SW-- and Texas in particular --it's often not taught at all. I'm a college history professor and the vast majority of my students have never heard of it unless they are from that region. They are more likely to know the Spanish-American war, but all they can tell you about that is ""Remember the Maine!"" and some of them think the state of Maine was somehow attacked by Spain.

High school history in much of the US isn't very substantial and mostly involves objective testing of lists of names/dates with little interpretation or context. Texas of course not only requires state history but has a state-wide textbook mandate; many other states do not so quality varies a lot from district to district. While state standards might even includes lists of events-- like the Mexican-American War --they are often taught as trivia.  AP/IB classes are better of course, but that's not what most people get."
37661,best Marvel movie,Kevin Feige has it as the number MCU film. Iger loved it as well.
24316,best anime,"I'm glad to hear that you like the list.   Evangelion, Bebop and Madoka are all great."
48289,best color to paint with,Yeah but then you have all this furniture that you have to remove or cover in order to do your painting.
69959,best major to study in college,"Pros: Super interesting, very broad range of subject material.
Cons: It will be VERY difficult to land a job. Even if you're planning on going into teaching, history is NOT an in-demand area for teachers. And if you do manage to land one, the pay will be crap.
Edit: Lots of people replying to me have said it's not hard to find a job as a history major, but nearly every single one of them has said that they are working in a field other than history. Food for thought..."
65532,best phone service company,"Verizon sucked in the gold country dorms if you faced the golf course tho, from what I remembered."
70328,best major to study in college,"Might have switched my math degree to a computer engineering with a math minor instead of vice versa. I would've left my psychology major and bio minor the same. Although I would've gone into a neuro program but I already had accumulated a significant amount of credits at an institution for which there was no neuro program. So currently I have psych, math majors and CprE, bio minors. I would've done CprE, Neuro/psych majors and math,bio minors."
30250,best Mexican war to study,"Usually with air quotes around ""war"" because it wasn't much of one.

It was presented mostly as a land grab justified by ""manifest destiny"" -- a term that started right around the same time.

Mexico's viewpoint is largely missing, perhaps viewed as not terribly important given how lopsided the conflict was.  The US was going to do it or not do it, and Mexico's desires and intentions were largely irrelevant."

44515,best items under $100,"Something ACTUALLY life changing and around a hundred bucks...a trauma kit. 

Not a booboo kit, trauma kit for massive injuries. 

Booboo kit is good too, you'd be surprised how useless Band-Aids are when the damage is severe enough. Edit. Booboo kits are gauze tape disinfectant and stuff beyond actual bandaids. 






Also dmt sharpening stones. Dull knives are garbage and maintenance isn't all that hard."
37810,best Marvel movie,Tony Leung was the soul of this movie so I don't know how the sequel is going to pan out. Hopefully they just add a lot more crazy stunts to make up for his absence.
25081,best spiderman actor,To be honest XMen did that.
60627,Best comedy show on Netflix,The Kominsky Method seasons 1 and 2. You can skip season 3.
13982,best research paper archive,"Well that is absolutely fascinating.  

I just grabbed [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16504284) review by Boccaccini to do a little more reading on the subject, seemed to be the most recent highly cited review.  Any other crucial papers you would recommend?  

(I also blame you for the 3 hours I'm inevitably about to lose)"
10959,best backpack for college,"I wouldn't say they are big, but just ideal. I'm 5'9 and it looks really slick and fits well on whatever I wear. They also have variety of other versions so you could check them out as well."
16702,best pet for toddlers,Don't get any pet just to get a pet. Identify what pet you are interested in and then research it. The kids won't be into a pet if it isn't one they want
38402,best newspapers to read,"The New York Times and Wall Street Journal every morning. The Economist, New Yorker, and New England Journal of Medicine weekly. I think I've associated information with tangible literature."
68892,best science fiction novel,"An alternative explanation is simply that they are good authors who don't take strong socio-political stances, not that they push right-wing agendas.

I tend to agree that this sub tends to be a bit too narrow (and I feel like it used to be a bit broader, maybe it was the death of the 'what have you read this month' threads that makes me feel like that) but that doesn't mean the readers here only read those books or have some ideological aversion to other books."
34783,best NFL player,"If I was in charge of a team and there was a draft of every player who ever lived at their prime age and I had the first overall pick, I would go Brady without much hesitation"
66789,best soccer team in the world,And because the FA sets quotas for home grown players. Thus artificially inflating their worth
70651,best movies with a cool twist,Nothing can prepare you for the second half of Sorry To Bother You
30912,best country to live in,"I'm a fan of Texas. Just try to avoid talking politics with anyone... You never know when otherwise very friendly people will turn out to be insane.

 Also, Austin is pretty crowded these days. Houston's got some good stuff going for it, but is more humid than the devil's ass crack. San Antonio doesn't feel like a city so much as a collection of suburbs and strip malls with a tourist trap in the center. Dallas is a bit...uh... old money? And El Paso is half way to California.

Or you could live somewhere smaller. But that would be risky."
35006,best NFL player,I donâ€™t know what to think
