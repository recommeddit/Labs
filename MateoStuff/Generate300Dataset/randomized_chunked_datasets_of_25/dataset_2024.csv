33713,best electric car,"I think that in the next few years, there really won't be any reason to use ICE instead of electric - except sentimental reasons.

I have nothing against EVs, but I still love everything about ICE from the noise to the smell to the powerband. I can't bear to seperate with it as good as electric motors are."
62056,Best RPG game on PS4,"Any of the most recent Assassin's Creed games (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla), Witcher 3, and the Watchdogs games."
64445,Best Nike running shoes,"I'd say still go in and get fitted. Be honest that you don't want to spend much, they usually have sale models. If they don't have anything in your budget at least you'll know what to look for when shopping later."
31723,best hotel to live in,"Do you know if they are comparing used or new paper vs electronic? Also, is that more the exception or the norm?"
32000,best hotel to live in,"I don’t have much experience in the budget category, but I like your recommendations on the upper end.

Drury Inn and Embassy Suites in particular are my go-tos."
72647,best wireless lightweight mouse,Logitech nailed it with the GPW. Hopefully the switches hold up.
27912,best breakfast foods,"Pancakes, blueberry pancakes with warm maple syrup...

Fluffy scrambled eggs with a dash of salt pepper and oregano...

Then bacon of course...crumbled up into the pancakes instead of blueberries if you want [bacon pancakes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=1eO5U_uN7DQ#t=9s)"
72582,best keyboard switches,Three only way to really tell the difference is to get a tester that comes with a bunch of different switches imo.
22416,best celebrity,"Snoop Dogg - Totally, unflappably chill, 100% of the time. It's like a super power.

Jon Bon Jovi - Smoked a cigarette with him, couldn't have been more down to earth. I believe he's making BBQ sandwiches for homeless people as we speak.

otoh:

Jeremy Piven - I like to give people the benefit of the doubt: Must've been method acting for the Ari Gold role."
69796,best major to study in college,"Once you get good at it, sales is an awesome gig. Outside sales is waaay better than the alternatives too. Freedom and cash."
45420,best gaming system,"My honest recommendation is to go for the Switch since it's the most relaxed of the consoles. You can undock it and play it on the couch and has a lot of great exclusives. Sure, it can't match the others in specs but you can play a bunch of indies, party games or Nintendo exclusives in it."
24373,best anime,"Tsuki ga Kirei was only on 1 list, but it's still very recent (2017), so maybe it'll climb higher as newer lists are published."

In the south western part of the state is Mt Monadnock, claimed to be one of the most hiked mountains in the world"
57810,best cologne,"30 bucks. ""The American Line"" is the brand name. They have one for each branch and a majority of the proceeds go to benefit veterans!

My friend I would gild you if I wasn't off work with a broken ankle right now. This is absolutely in my ""to-buy"" list."
27772,best breakfast foods,"Okay my question is probably going to sound stupid but when you say healthy breakfast for the week, do you mean freeze it in portions and then thaw every morning? If yes, do you leave it out to thaw to room temp or do you microwave? I'm trying to eat healthier and this sounds like something I could do."
63084,Best online React course,"Agreed. Only good reason to learn them is so you can convert them to functional components easily. Hooks are amazing, helps to write very clean code."
73352,best battery bank,I took my anchor on a 3-day backpacking canoe trip and it's save me the entire time with two bars left of charge (50%)
20490,best workout music,Nothing says go harder like FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME
31917,best hotel to live in,One thing on hotel living - breakfast. Most hotels offer poor quality carbs for breakfast and so if you want a protein rich breakfast you will need to eat out a lot as you will not have access to a kitchen. Main reason we never hotel more than a week.
