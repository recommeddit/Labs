Both my husband and I are at Southern New Hampshire University. They have quite a few degree programs and a very flexible schedule. They've got many start dates in the year. I do the 4 semesters a year. Classes are 8 weeks long. but they also have standard class times. They've got discounts for military and I believe all of the military academic advisors have served. It is an awesome school. I am using FAFSA and my husband is using TA. They were very accommodating for the TA! Only took my husband about 3 weeks to get everything set up from company to school.
"The Usual Suspects is the top one for me simply because at first, there's the twist and you think ""oh man, it was that guy all along"" and then, BAM! They twist the twist. Either way, the best ones are the movies that, as soon as you're finished, you want to watch again to see if the twist holds out from the beginning because you just didn't see it."
"Don't demean hagelslag by calling it sprinkles, people might think they are like the type of chocolate sprinkles you put on ice cream.  Hagelsag is real milk chocolate, so it actually has a taste.  I also like to put hagel on a biscuit with peanut butter, it's like eating a Reese's cup for breakfast.  This definitely requires a glass of milk with it."
Do you know how many views Gangnam Style got?
My sister once called me racist for liking vanilla ice cream
"Tom Holland and it isn't even close. He embodies everything about Peter Parker that I love, and I can't think of a comic book character brought to life in better fashion than Tom has done with Peter."

"Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman from Mythbusters are amazingly nice to fans. My son, seven years old at the time, asked them questions that had me cringing and thinking, ""You had a chance to ask them something and you asked them this??"" But Adam and Jamie treated his questions as seriously as they would have treated a question from Barack Obama. They acted like we were the most important people in the world at that moment, and like they had no better place to be."

"Damn. That's...isn't that worthy of a court-martial? ""Loose lips sink ships?"" Did you ever see someone disciplined for that sort of thing?"
"For some reason this is really hard to find, thanks much."
Hope you enjoy! WorthABuy‚Äôs review of the game really put me in the right headspace for it. You‚Äôve got to live Henry‚Äôs life because you‚Äôre an idiot blacksmith‚Äôs apprentice - you literally don‚Äôt know how to do anything and the game is about that competence-creep and slowly getting better at these really dangerous things.
GO! BWAH!
Necos are the shit. Also who doesn't like candy corn?
"I made a list for someone else that asked a bit ago.  I'll copy it here.

Fast, aggressive stuff.  Much harder to talk yourself out of that last mile/set/rep with testosterone-fueled rage in your ears."
"In highschool I wanted to major in Computer Science, and now that I'm in college, I'm working with pre-law.

EDIT: Looks like I need to reevaluate my classes that I signed up to be in for the Fall Semester. For the record, I am terrible at math, and that was a large variable in ditching CS.

EDIT 2: Mislabeled myself. Not majoring in a dedicated ""Pre-Law"" course branch, I'm really just double majoring in Criminal Justice and Philosophy.


Thanks for the input, everyone. I've only just begun college, going into my second year soon. I think I still need to see where I can go."
"I have nearly finished the webdev 101 course, about to start the Ruby section. 101 touches on everything, but even with that you will be building a Rails blog and putting it on GitHub. 101 even covers using RSpec to do Test Driven Development, which seems to be common in the industry but is something a hobby programmer may never come across. With all that just from the intro course I am very interested to see what is covered in the more detailed sections."
Is 1440 4k?
"Not a story of mine, so can‚Äôt really confirm but nevertheless made me laugh my ass off.

So a friend of mine had the chance to meet Patrick Roach (Guy who plays Randy in Trailer Park Boys) in a party. Being a huge fan of the show, my friend walks up to him and tells him how he‚Äôs been a fan of the show since childhood and how he respects his acting. Apparently the guy just looked at him, said ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs cool man! Watch this!‚Äù And proceeded to pound fat line of coke through his nose right in front of him..."
