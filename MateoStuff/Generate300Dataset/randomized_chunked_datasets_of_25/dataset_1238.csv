8843,best toothpaste,"Isn't this relevant to OP's question? Some whitening toothpastes actually do contain things that alter the color of your teeth. The fluoride in toothpaste is there to help your enamel, is it not? Wouldn't that make an actual difference between toothpastes, and give regular toothpaste a purpose?"

8441,best toothpaste,"I live in a developing country that doesn’t really sell Crest, and I don’t like Colgate at all, so I started buying the ClinPro from my dentist.  I love the flavor and the lack of a lasting taste in my mouth.  But it was expensive, about $12 a tube, and the tubes were kind of smaller than a US sized one."
30581,best Mexican war to study,"I have to say, living in a place that has its fair share of conspiracy theorists, I wouldn't actually take his word on it. From what you've said, I can interpret the economic partnership with Britain as a pretext to all of the scenarios you described."

46391,best trick or treating candy,"What my family has always done:


Give no more than 3 pieces to each kid.  If they are young they get more.  If they are really young then they only get one.  Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized. 


edit: if they are dressed really cool the get more.


Put the candy in the bag, don't let them pick out of the bowl.


Candy sounds good.  250 pieces should be enough.


Just turn on the front lights. And have the door open.


5-8 should be fine


If you run out of candy: Set an empty bowl out side in front of the door and close it.  But keeps the lights on.  Lights off will make you look like someone who wasn't giving out candy at all.  (then hope.  TP isn't bad eggs are)"
