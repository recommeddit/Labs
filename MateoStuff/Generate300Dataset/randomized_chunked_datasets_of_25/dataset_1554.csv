16719,best pet for toddlers,Get a hamster. They are pretty easy to take care of and not very expensive. I wouldn’t get a dog they are a ton of work. We have 2 that we had prior to kids and everyday I wish we didn’t have them. They are so annoying but they are older so I can’t really just get rid of them since no one will take them. Plus the worse part is we travel a lot and it cost us $60 a day to kennel them when we do. Ughhh.

They're usually right."
68012,best science fiction novel,"I was never really into Warhammer 40K at all, but I picked up Eisenhorn years ago and it was amazing.
