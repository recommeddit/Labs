"I found mine on Amazon, its a Logitech and works great!"

3. Late registration 
4. The college dropout 
5. Donda 
6. 808’s & heartbreak 
7. The life of pablo 
8. Ye 
9. Yeezus (criminally overrated)
10. Jesús is king."
Not a college student but I did a ton of research and picked up a Patagonia backpack. It's a great brand worthy of a mention here.
my dentist recommended a sonicare because i was brushing too hard with a regular brush. it does make my teeth feel extra squeaky clean! plus i love that it times my toothbrushing for me.
"If you get the chance, visit the museum of cultural anthropology in Mexico City. I was lucky enough to get to visit back in 1994 and could have spent a week there just seeing everything... very enlightening."
I highly recommend finished the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* series (Three-Body Trilogy). The scope expands with each book and it gets so interesting. Highly recommend finishing it!
Anyone have a suggestion for a bumper case with no clear part? Ideally something that matches with the blue pro color
2nd Sucks by ADTR is a good choice
"1. Sainty
2. Northie
3. Kourtney"
very into this.
"Isnt Amir a big jerk?

He has an illegitimate child who he has disowned"
I bought chronic 2001 :) such an good album.
"Not sure if this counts as Sci-Fi, but The Martian was great"
"I'd pref below $20,000. I was considering saving for the new Corolla Hybrid but am more on the fuck gas entirely side. Work is currently 12 miles total but my office is moving to within two miles from me. Hanging out with my girlfriend is between 18-30 miles total. I'm looking at the possible 80 Range. I don't have a charger yet as my family is skeptical of electric vehicles but I can get one installed, I just need to research more about it. Workplace charging isn't available, size can be any as I'm 22 and mostly just drive with my girlfriend in the family car. AWD is nice but not completely needed. Currently not considering road trips as I would probably take the train for long road trips rather than the car."
"Now what you're bout to hears a tale of glory and sin

No ID my mentor now let the story begin"
"Old Fashioned, Manhattan or a Boulevardier."
Guru Dutt
"Kim

"Opera sells your data
A shame cuz its a really solid browser especially their Opera GX version"
"I grew up playing guitar, but if given the choice between that and the drums I take the drums every time. They're so fun."
No idea how they get away with charging memberships for their site..but it's been up and running like this for quite a while and they go free like once every couple months and it usually lasts 3-5 days.
"Article is crap. Submission headline isn't. Submitter screwed up. However, the CDC recommends that water and soap be preferred over using hand sanitizer by itself. You can, of course, use both.

As for antibacterial soap, from all I've seen, there's little to suggest a significant benefit of it vs regular soap (and vice versa). The fears of resistant strains resulting from their use is overblown, as is the relevance of antibacterial soap's ability to kill more germs."
This video is utterly fascinating. An hour of absolute madness. Worth watching as a fun fantasy story.
