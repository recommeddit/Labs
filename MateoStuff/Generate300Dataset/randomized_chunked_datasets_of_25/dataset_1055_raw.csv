"Magnum is a 31 year old Arrow in a park with a huge number of winners. Honestly, I am ecstatic to see it so high up still.

RMCs and other newer coasters are more universally acclaimed, while older coasters like Magnum have their fanbases but naturally lose some sheen with newer enthusiasts. It's predictable, and it makes sense to me to see things laid out this way.

Lovely poll. Thanks for sharing it!"
"It's actually pretty easy to not be a monster. Setting aside the rebellion most teens go through, just ask yourself some questions.

1) Do you take them seriously when they try to go to you with problems?

2) Do you make them feel like they are loved and accepted for who they are?

3) Do you treat them fairly?

4) Do you set reasonable rules, explain the reasons for them, and apply them equitably? (expansion of 3)

If you can honestly answer yes to all four questions, you're probably doing ok and once they get past the teenage years you'll be fine."
"Hopefully it won't be buried this time, but Don Hutson."
"Yes, Liverpool and Juve too. Of course ManU is up there too."
I want a garden gnome.
"If it's a long drive, that may be pretty hard on her. 

My first year in college I lived at home with a 40+ minute drive even when there were no big problems on the freeway. :)"
"Best quests in an rpg I've ever played. Even the side quests felt like main content. I platinum'ed the base game, but I hear that the dlcs are amazing as well. Would definitely put W3 as my top suggestion to anyone."
"I found him the LEAST reliable narrator. He came across as willing to say anything, and bend over backwards, to make the Sanyasins look good and 'righteous'... and I found him to be completely still under the spell of the whole cult. Meanwhile, I found Ma Shanti B MUCH more relatable as someone who was part of it and left and realized the danger of what she was a part of. While I agree I found Swami fascinating, I found myself disliking his unwillingness to admit that any aspect of what was going on was severely fucked up."
"Where's Wipeout? :( Wipeout Fusion and SSX 3 had to be my top PS2 games. Fusion looks fantatsic on pcsx2. 

WipeoutHD for the PS3 was excellent too. Where are the space racers for pc."
"In addition to this, also consider the point made by u/kirakun in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/jpixsy/easiest_instrument_to_play/gbfdyo3/).

The piano is good at playing many notes. But when you play a single note, the degree of control is constrained to just the initial action and the release of the key. Hence the expressive potential of a single note is limited compared to say the violin or the clarinet. When you play *more* notes, this limitation starts to fade away because by playing more notes you have more instances of the initial key action and the key release each of which gives you the chance to inject expression into the playing. For piano playing, it's almost as though *more is better*. Can you imagine playing only the melody of *Amazing Grace* on the piano with no accompaniment nor embellishment and still make it sound expressive? Maybe just a little. But [on the trumpet](https://youtu.be/qhTZpjayF_s?t=95), it's a different thing altogether."

"If you're looking for a $100-$200 dollar budget gpu, the Ge-Force 1030 2gb the best I've seen for that price range right now, just make sure its GDDR5 and not GDDR4. 

If you have a couple hundred dollars more then 1050ti would be even better."
"Oh great , thanks I’ll look into it ."
Switzerland! Easiest thing to do to live here is get married to someone Swiss.
"I know.. if anyone wanted it used, it’s over $45 for the cartridge alone.. that’s so crazy!"
Instant Pot & slow cooker
Mesa Pizza.
Please don't buy me gifts. They clutter up my space but I feel bad about throwing them away.
"I think you ultimately get out of the game what you put into it... there are a few recent additions that allow you to passively collect your credits, but at a much lower rate than if you were active about it."
hey it works
"Was Christmas gifted AFFO a while back, played it a few times solo, left it at a friend's place and forgot about it.  Should probably pick it back up and give it another go!"
"I’ve ran the Adobe Suite, or at least PS and AI, perfectly fine on Ubuntu, Deepin, Kubuntu, now Manjaro, and probably other distros I’m forgetting.

As long as you don’t bork / botch the wine installation, or the files therein, you should be fine. There shouldn’t really be an update pipeline that would disrupt it, not in the sense that it should break anymore.

If memory serves, there’s even a script / installer now for photoshop (on GitHub I think) that installs all of the required dependencies in its own prefix for you.

Agreed about fedora. It was my first distro and it's still the one I fall back on the most. Feels like home
"And btw a big additional comment - i have done around 25% of the course, and I am at Section 12 (Hooks). Grider teaches Hooks using naturally FC. And he sometimes goes back to CC in order to show the evoluion of CC >>> FC with Hooks, so it looks like we were studying the CC only in order to get a good look at how these processes were used to be done. I am not sure about the rest of the course as to whether we are going to delve back into CC or not, but at this point there's no way that I am going to switch to another course. 

And, ofc, all courses are crap, and naked docs are the best but this is my first lang."
