I like the eLife podcast. This week in virology is also really awesome.
"To be honest, no idea about the pool parties. I know capitol cities was there last year. Fest opens around 2 and ends at 1."
"TI-89 all the way. Solves systems of equations, differential equations, systems of differential equations, calculates limits, derivatives, definite integrals, indefinite integrals, matrix products, vector functions, graphs in 2D and 3D, and has any extra apps you could ever need for statistics, finance, engineering, etc. It also has crazy battery life and a massive catalog of any function you could think of (http://tibasic.wikia.com/wiki/Catalog_(89)). It can do pretty much anything you want."

"Glad to see your efforts on improving `nnn`. I use it a lot, it's a godsend on RasPi-like SBCs. But I found also good usage for it on my main Linux PCs.

For everybody pushing `ranger`: I use `mc` and `nnn`, each for different purposes. A test of `ranger` didn't give a good impression for me - too confusing, kind of in between `mc` and `nnn`, but not as good as either.

You should try `nnn`, and also the other utilities /u/sablal wrote. He has a knack for writing useful and lean apps. `nnn` is less than 30kB for the binary, with a ton of features. In contrast, look at `Etcher`, which clocks in at 100MB as an AppImage (only available Linux option) and doesn't anything else besides writing an image to disk and verifying it.

I am disgusted by this trend and wish there would be more like `nnn`, not like `Etcher`."
"Easy - ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark"""
I use these they blew me away for the price
This this this!!!! I have been going into sephora and smelling it for months now.  For Christmas I got myself the rollerball and my husband got me the bottle.  It's so light and amazing
SF Signal made a [flowchart](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/flowchart_for_navigating_nprs_top_100_sff_books/) of NPR’s top 100 sci-fi and fantasy books. Just be aware some of them are strictly fantasy.
“Get your shit together” by Bonnie Wright. Funny and insightful.
"Makes sense, the only thing really holding me background getting a matte protector right now is the miniled :’("
"this book SO good.

picked it up because of this cover like 7 years ago http://bookcoverarchive.com/images/books/altered_carbon.large.jpg
and it started by book devouring craze of ""hey, theres others genres except boring british fiction that was required school reading"""
"Not an interior designer, but I've noticed a ton of whites/greys or neutrals. Also, red front doors. Not sure why the red doors."
"Hmm, I’m not sure you used the prober verb tense there."
"Plain chocolate ice cream, slow churned"
Yeah... 120hz and up is insanely nice but chasing that fps in every games has become an obsession for me lol
Casino Royale.
"Any interview of Aamir you can point out where he said he is the best actor ?

Most of the interview he says that he needs to put much more effort commpared to other actor e.g. Ammitabh, Dileep Kumaar, Raghubeer day and Zaira waseem.


Naseerudhdhin Shah says that he is one of the most secure actor and have no issue working with actors better than him."
"I just recommended it to you, please watch it. It is fucking hilarious. There are 2 movies out and more are coming. The show is not that long but it is comedy gold."
I... would really eat that! jamon serrano's awesome. what was your recipe like?
Don't really see what the 'twist' is in that one.
"You’re so wrong. It’s not even the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor. It looks amazing on paper, and in the store. The flavors really are pretty bland though, not a strong vanilla or chocolate flavor - mostly just sweet. Also, eating it becomes a process of trying to just get that one last chunk, eating the whole thing, and feeling ill.   
  
It’s not a bad flavor, at all. But certainly not the best. Cherry Garcia stomps Half Baked."
"I usually combine couple of calendars in 1 view. But you are right, it can be viewed in one place, but not managed from one place, so you still need to manage two apps"
"It depends completly on what kind of music you want to make, and what you want out of your instrument. 

I prefer acouatic guitar, personally. Piano is also great, and it is more suited to visually getting theory, but it's not portable, and you can do bends or easy chromatic slides, and the timber sounds like a piano. Piano sounds cool for piano stuff but acoustic guitar sounds cool for acoustic guitar style stuff. 

Piano is also useful for doing production stuff with midi, but so is guitar, especially with some of the tech available that will only get better."
