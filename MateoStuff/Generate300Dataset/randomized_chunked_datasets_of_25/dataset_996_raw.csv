"Who works out to Cake? Good band and everything, but if I am trying to lift more than I probably should, I don't think Cake is going to help me with a rep."
Have you seen Cubs fans in the last couple years?

Bingo.
Can you see and enjoy Picassoâ€™s artwork in its originally intended fashion? Yes. Sounds pretty open source to me.
"Objectively, gameboy (RBY) games are the worst because they are the slowest running, worst graphically, horribly balanced, offer no post-game besides mewtwo and are filled with bugs and glitches

Objectively, I would HG/SS are the best. They provide the most content: 16 gyms, Red, Multiple bonus legendaries to find, Pokemon following you, rematching gym leaders, battle frontier, etc

Subjectly, Sword and Shield are the worst because the show just how stagnant the series is and how tired gamefreak is of making these games. Barely any post game without DLC (or if you don't care about competitive), the wild area is pretty barren all things consider, super short routes, possibly the worst story in the series, one of the easiest games in the franchise if not the easiest and only beaten out in hand-holding the player by gen 7.

Subjectively, Black and White 2 are the best. I just had the most fun playing white 2 out of any of these games."
"My husband really wants a dog. My youngest daughter loves dogs and asks pet every dog she sees. My oldest daughter is just barely getting over her fear of dogs. Unfortunately we can't have dogs in our apartment. My oldest daughter has autism and my husband planned on using that as a loophole to get a companion dog, lol.

Ultimately it seemed easier to get a companion cat for her (we initially got the cat for her but my youngest daughter was the one who the cat became a companion to)."

"I've had one for a few years. Finally paid off when a guy backed into me at full throttle while we were waiting at a red light. Without it, I'm sure I would have been blamed for rear-ending him."

"Youâ€™re correct, I think I got it confused with the XR being $100 cheaper now."
A bit edgy maybe but xxxtentacion also has good aggressive songs

A columnar peach tree might do. They get about 20ft tall but stay pretty..columnar. they don't spread much. They also have nice flowers in the spring.
"God forbid people add details that donâ€˜t match your particular experience. You may as well replace music with other media like photos or video. A requirement of up to 512 GB is certainly not the norm, but also not unreasonable in 2019."
"I got one for a coworker friend of mine who retired.

It was $125 normally and for another $25, they were able to customize it more to the pic and include his work shirt and glasses.

This was like 10 years ago so there's probably a lot more companies with 3D printers cranking these things out."
