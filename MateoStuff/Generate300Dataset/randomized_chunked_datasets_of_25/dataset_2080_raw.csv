"[Evangelical comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_tract) written by a complete whackdoodle.  You can probably find some more examples online if you've got the stomach for it.  Some of them are real train-wrecks.

I ran into a couple (and some imitators) while growing up in the '90s.  I haven't seen any in the wild for quite a while now."

"Great film.

Stephen King has called the ending more brutal than he could have thought up himself. 

Trivia: The mist in the movie is actually a [Thinny](http://stephenking.wikia.com/wiki/Thinny). A Thinny is a doorway between worlds in the Stephen King universe and they appear on several occasion in The Dark Tower."
"1Q84 is interesting, but it is terribly slow and draggy."

Got a link to those music charts?

"Not even close to be honest. Barcelona from 2009 was much, much better. AC Milan 89-94. Liverpool in the 70's and 80's. Plenty of better teams."
"I haven't tried it yet, but I bought some the other day because I had a coupon. Now I'm excited! Yay!"
Damn you are broke. You worked 6 months for 100 bucks
"Outside of Thanos and Killmonger, what do you think are some good MCU villains? I liked Loki but I don't know if he counts. Hela was o.k., but mostly visually--her storyline didn't do a lot for me."

Sorry but I haven't purchased the pro version yet. Still debating about it
Mmmmmm. The smell of the range....
"Well, that’s the interview process. You are correct that you have to do this process, but it’s not an invite per se from another user. You just hop on, que up, read rules, answer questions etc."
I think Paddinton 2 can be described as an adventure movie. A fantastic movie of a bear who goes on a big adventure full of ups and down while trying to get a gift for his step mom. Best movie of 2018 for me.
"Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt - aromatic, a little green and oceanic, overall clean and very close to the skin.

Philosophy Amazing Grace - has a soapy quality and is floral, too. I find it to be refreshing and it just smells pretty to me.

Pacifica French Lilac - fresh lilacs

Jo Malone English Oak and Hazelnut - simple, sharp and woody. The opening has a citrus smell to me that gives it that sharp quality. 

Atelier Cologne Cèdre Atlas - Heavier on the bergamot/citrus notes than JM English Oak and Hazelnut. Woody and clean with a strong citrus character. 

Chanel No. 5 L'Eau - sparkling but also fuzzy (I know that's vague). This smells well blended to me; I can't pick out individual notes. There is a floral quality but it's not sweet or too strong.

J-Scent Roasted Green Tea - starts strong and bitter but that goes away in a second. It's a little citrusy, a little creamy and sweet. I do smell green tea. It reminds me of Replica Tea Escape but TE is smoother, creamier, and sweeter, and has less emphasis on the green tea than RGT. 

Hermes Un Jardin Sur le Toit - green, grassy, apples. Sweet but refreshing too, very green. It feels sunny and happy. 

Diptyque L'Eau Rose - light and fresh rose w/ stem and leaves."

"It depends on what’s in the hand sanitizer. 

The triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers. 

For alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol’s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol’s effect. In fact it’s so unlikely that it hasn’t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of. 

The 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin. 

Please correct me if I’m wrong or have any assumptions I should state. 

Edit: felt that further clarification of why spores don’t develop resistance was necessary.
You can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won’t react to any stimulus at ergo they won’t acquire resistance since they aren’t really living (so to speak)
They are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?"
Ugh.
The bezels are a benefit you notice every time though..
"Few quibbles with this list. 

But I would say, that ""Ringworld"" as #1 in a series is misleading. Several short stories and a few Known Space novels preceeded it. When I read ""Ringworld"" after reading those, it was a culmination of the stories, and completely blew me away."
