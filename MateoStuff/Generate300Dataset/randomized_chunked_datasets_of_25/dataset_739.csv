Poster below brought up a good idea if you’re on a limited budget. 

• Prep a long bed as if for a vegetable garden. 

• Plant annuals —like sunflowers —behind your “seedling” trees for the next decade. 

• Add in a couple of larger “real” trees in strategic privacy spots for **immediate** impact. $200-400 a tree

• Add more each season —or as they go on sale— as your budget permits.",best tree for the garden

41222,"AGREED Maisky is amazing. I saw him perform Shostakovich Cello Concerto with the LA Phil and he had this flare I hadn't witnessed before in other solo cellists. Yo-Yo Ma is amazing technically and I think he does great performances (saw him play Dvorak concerto, wowzers), but he also lacks personality sometimes in his playing. Maisky has personality that just resonates well with his understanding of the music and technicality. 

Johannes Moser is pretty great too (and really nice to look at)",best instrument to play

1554,"Yeah, I do 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup of sugar and a pinch of salt.
I mix that together in a sauce pan until the milk starts to simmer.
I whip 5 large egg yolks together. When the egg yolks are sufficiently whipped I take the milk mixture off the heat and slowly whip in the egg yolk.  Once the eggs are in I add a tsp to 2 tsps of vanilla extract, I add less usually but if I have a cheaper bourbon I'll add more. 
Then I reheat it until I get a custard. I take it off the heat and stir in a 1/4 cup of bourbon and then I chill it. Once it's chilled I throw it in my ice cream maker.
I never have a problem with it freezing b/c there's not a lot of alcohol in it.",best ice cream flavor

30164,"Grew up in Texas, and this is kind of how I remember it being taught. 

It was mostly a weird footnote to ""we fought against Mexico for our independence.  They didn't agree that we won and we eventually joined the United States and settled it for good."" 

I never really realized why Mexico still felt they had a claim to Texas until I was around 30 and did a little research.  I get it, it would be kind of like if Washington state seceded and while we were still arguing about whether or not that was really a thing, they suddenly said ""haha, we're Canadians now!""  

A hundred years later you'd still kind of feel like you got robbed somehow and those people are still sorta US citizens.",best Mexican war to study
