28290,best breakfast foods,"A sixcup moka pot with equal parts milk, and whole grain bread with cheese is my go-to breakfast.

If I know I'm having a rough/looong day and I'm in a hurry, a shake consisting of frozen banana, straw/raspberry, oats, milk and cookie-flavored protein powder -> a liter of awesome. Fluffy, nutritious, cold, scrumptious awesome.

(also really good post-workout)"

38778,best web browser,It doesn't matter. They are all fast. People acting like as if it really matters. Unless you have a shitty computer with a HD.
20,best terminal file manager reddit,"Probably unpopular opinion here:

If I really need a file-manager, my go to is emacs + dired + tramp. 

Otherwise zsh + coreutils + awk, sed, grep etc. is more than enough."
71703,best movies with a cool twist,"Butterfly Effect

&#x200B;"
54836,best water filter,"Couple drops per liter, as far as i know its around half a caps worth, and regarding the ""resistant to chlorination"" bit, that's why you should boil it afterwards too... 

Most filtration systems are as good as the smallest particle they can stop."
28075,best breakfast foods,Biscuits and Sausage Gravy. If I was on death row that would be my final meal.
29857,best money managing app,"Like others said, YNAB is excellent for monthly budgeting and future projections. Personal Capital is also really good for tracking investment portfolios. It has monthly budgeting as well but I'd argue that YNAB is superior in that regard.

That said, I gave up on Mint because it would routinely screw up my bank accounts and make me have to update my passwords after too many invalid login attempts. I also got insanely annoyed with the ads it had. Still, I guess it can be good for someone who's just starting out with budgeting because it's definitely the easiest to use out of the others I mentioned."

42044,movies like Inception,"The fountain. Stars Hugh jackman with amazing music and what I feel am amazing story. Some people hate it, I love it."
14671,best romantic novel,"I love JR Ward's Blackdagger Brotherhood series! And the Blackdagger Legacy seems to be coming along alright as well. I love that there's a bigger overall storyline than the romance aspect of the books. And said storyline is actually good enough so far that if the romance parts were taken out, there'd still be a good book leftover. 

I was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to really get into The Bourbon Kings though. I heard such good things, but it just wasn't for me. Too much drama, I think."
