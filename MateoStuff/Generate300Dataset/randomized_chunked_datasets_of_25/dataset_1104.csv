If I know I'm having a rough/looong day and I'm in a hurry, a shake consisting of frozen banana, straw/raspberry, oats, milk and cookie-flavored protein powder -> a liter of awesome. Fluffy, nutritious, cold, scrumptious awesome.

That said, I gave up on Mint because it would routinely screw up my bank accounts and make me have to update my passwords after too many invalid login attempts. I also got insanely annoyed with the ads it had. Still, I guess it can be good for someone who's just starting out with budgeting because it's definitely the easiest to use out of the others I mentioned.",best money managing app

I love that there's a bigger overall storyline than the romance aspect of the books. And said storyline is actually good enough so far that if the romance parts were taken out, there'd still be a good book leftover. 

I was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to really get into The Bourbon Kings though. I heard such good things, but it just wasn't for me. Too much drama, I think.",best romantic novel
