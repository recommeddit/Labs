55489,best action and adventure novel series,"The Furies of Calderon series is classic adventure fantasy. Jim Butcher wrote it as his homage to the swords and horses adventures he loved as a kid. The climaxes are awesome. I laughed, I cried, my mind was blown. Butcher is a master at building conflicts full of tension and surprise as well as crafting intense, realistic fight scenes. The magic system is solid here too."

10586,best suitcase lock,"The thieves you worry about in most situations don't exist in airports.  No run of the mill thief is going to open my bag in an airport because it is with me all the time except for when it is possessed by airport employees.  In this scenario, the only thieves to worry about are airport employees and those thieves rely on having access to everyone's bag with no oversight or immediate oversight that is corrupt.  For them, it isn't a question of getting easy access to anyone's bag as they have access to everyone's.  They have to decide which bags to open as they get to pick and choose which bags are worth looking inside.  In this case, a padlock is an attractant and a non-factor as a deterrent."

53623,best medicine for a cold,My husband got sick while we were in Prague over Easter one year and I had to find a pharmacy window to get him some meds as NOTHING was sold OTC.  The pharmacist gave me a bunch of super strong meds which totally made his feel better and it cost the equivalence of $7.00 - it was amazing.  I was so grateful.

48327,best color to paint with,"I used Sherwin Williams Alabaster and I like it a lot. I used it on both south-facing and north-facing rooms and it looks good in both. I used Benjamin Moore’s Simply White on my kitchen cabinets. I like it a lot in that application, but in my opinion it’s a little too stark white for a whole room, but I’m sure it depends on your taste."
