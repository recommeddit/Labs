55489,"The Furies of Calderon series is classic adventure fantasy. Jim Butcher wrote it as his homage to the swords and horses adventures he loved as a kid. The climaxes are awesome. I laughed, I cried, my mind was blown. Butcher is a master at building conflicts full of tension and surprise as well as crafting intense, realistic fight scenes. The magic system is solid here too.",best action and adventure novel series

10586,"The thieves you worry about in most situations don't exist in airports.  No run of the mill thief is going to open my bag in an airport because it is with me all the time except for when it is possessed by airport employees.  In this scenario, the only thieves to worry about are airport employees and those thieves rely on having access to everyone's bag with no oversight or immediate oversight that is corrupt.  For them, it isn't a question of getting easy access to anyone's bag as they have access to everyone's.  They have to decide which bags to open as they get to pick and choose which bags are worth looking inside.  In this case, a padlock is an attractant and a non-factor as a deterrent.",best suitcase lock
