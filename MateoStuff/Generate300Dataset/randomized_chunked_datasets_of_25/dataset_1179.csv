47482,"This is just sort of my opinion, it won't fly with most others. But to me I really like just camping in the middle of the California high desert. There are tons of places you can go to where there's nothing. If you're more outdoorsy you can backpack a few days into the Sierra Nevada's and be literally almost a hundred miles from civilization. Something about being around unadulterated nature. Mankind hasn't ruined it. No roads or campground tables. Just you, your tent and the mountains.",best state to visit in the United States

61061,"I agree, mostly. Like I alluded to in my comment, the Sopranos is a better show of ""writing"" on a line to line basis. The Wire's overarching story format (what I would call...crafting....schematic? I guess) is fantastic.

But The Sopranos is about far more than Tony Soprano. It's about the death of an institution, the changing of a country, and an exploration of (a)morality.",Best comedy show on Netflix

2524,"Not over ear but I join the praise. This set is amazing for its price as long as you don't mind pinching some hair with the band on occasion.

It is a very good set. There is a version with an in line mic but I don't have that. It is essentially unchanged for decades.

I can also join previous recommendations on the sennheisers and Sony sets as well as the ath-m50 which is a bit over budget but you cab sometimes find good deals. Also on Amazon.

I splurged on v-moda m100 recently but 70 USD will get you a good pair.

At this price I also recommend looking at AKG cans as well as the German Teufel, but the latter isn't to my own taste. Others recommend it.",best headphones
