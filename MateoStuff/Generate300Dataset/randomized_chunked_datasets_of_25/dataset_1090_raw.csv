"Chi-5 are the best. Personally I would choose San Nic, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, Anacapa, Santa Cruz (in order). But they are all pretty similar and any would be good. Manzanita is more sophomores. FT is a mile off campus but 1/3 of the freshmen class lives there."
"100k? No, if you're in exploration geology and put in the time you absolutely can once you get your P.Geo."

"Oh, I guess I didn't really read your first post that told me what category it went in, so I guessed. Changed it to your suggestion."
I definitely read that sentence wrong at first...
... I have no idea how to respond to people who think HTML and CSS can't be used to execute malware. Good luck browsing the internet.
"I tried your Colgate toothpaste.  The one with tartar control.

And it made me feel.  **LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT!!!!@!**"
So it is their silicone that is of good quality? Usually the silicone clings in the pockets and above all takes all the dust on it.
Rusty’s is reasonably similar to Round Table. But there are many better spots like Bettina and Olio Pizzeria.
"So I have a few,

The obvious ones like fight club and the prestige, great movies!

Seven is one of my all time favorites but I think someone has already mentioned it

I watched a movie on Netflix once called 13 sins (I think?) And I remember it having a great ending with an exciting twist. Haven't been able to find it again

But my all time favorite twist ending to a movie was the ending to Arrival. Such an amazing twist and probably the best alien movie I've ever seen."
Nord is a data collection agency.
"That’d be M not W for mit,Harvard location"
"Looking at WoF's history, it seems like Cedar Fair had a lot of interest in the park for the first 15 years or so after they bought it and then haven't bothered to add any major coasters in over a decade. An 11 year drought is pretty shitty of them.

Dorney, ValleyFair and MiA all seem to be in the same boat. I hope you guys all see some new coasters, or at least some good relocations, soon. The theme of WoF seems pretty cool at least."
"This definitely will change when I complete some anime in my plan-to-watch list.

William Shatner told me to fuck off when I accosted him on the street once. Loved it.
"Nope, but you can add multiple profiles in either browser."
"After trying a free options, I decided to try this one since it was cheap. It works wonderfully! Thanks for the suggestion."
This is the way.
"My gun case is the luggage. It does not fit in a soft case. You're right though, TSA can't make any identifying marks on the case indicating it's a firearm. However, seeing a pelican case (especially if it's a 1700 series) has a high probability or being a firearm. Secondly, pelican cases in general are seen as carrying important and often valuable stuff (cameras, guns, electronics/computers) so they are already a theft risk. 

Plus if you're smart and noticed non-TSA locks you would have again a high chance of some sort of firearm in that case or it would have to have TSA locks."
"""Back home"" - is that your parents?

Dude, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If all you need is a change, go camping for a week. You'll love the hotel when you get back to it."
"Oops sorry, I might've overlooked the reply. I'd simply recommend the MacBook Air/Pro if you don't have any preference on the OS."
"I’ve never been impressed with paxis. Even though i know it’s a chain, blaze is pretty good. Haven’t yet found a good ny style here (I lived in upstate NY for a while)"
"Oh, I'm so happy you liked it!! Hmm let me think about it... Okay, anything by Ilona Andrews is golden, their Kate Daniels and Hidden Legacy series are amazing, then Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare if you're into historicals, Penny Reid and her Knitting in the City and Winston Brothers series are pretty good too, and I really like Caitie Quinn's Brew Ha Ha series (they're chaste, as in the most action that happens is a kiss here and there but still really sweet). 

I read a lot of romance as you can tell lol but yeah, I hope you enjoy at least something from this list."
detox bath?
