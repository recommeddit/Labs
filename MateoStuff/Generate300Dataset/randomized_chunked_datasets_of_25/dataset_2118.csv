60334,Best comedy show on Netflix,I fell in the piiiit
66364,best soccer team in the world,"If you want to compare this versus what teams have actually won in a visual format, compare it with an interactive visualisation I made at http://www.thebigclubs.com.

It is updated for all this seasons league and European wins!

The relevant filter to press would probably be “Dynasty” mode for a like for like with OP’s poll."
32662,best vacation resort,"We found YouTube clips from people who had been to the resorts we liked to get an unvarnished look at them. Also, typically in the resorts on outer islands seem to have poorer food quality for price than ones on mainland Mexico. Makes sense, I suppose since it has to be delivered there."
29134,best calendar tool,"Linkme: TimeTree  
Haven't used it myself, but it was suggested in another calendar thread, specifically for sharing with others."
8384,best toothpaste,"Sounds like you may have a build up on you tonsils. Does it feel grainy when you drink water, like a weird feeling in your neck? If so then it may be tonsil stones

Quick remedy is gargling salt water three times a day and that should loosen it up enough to cough it up at some point. Warning  though, if you do, don't crush it as it smells like shit and decay

(I'm not a dentist, but had them and was given this advice and it worked)"
16280,best sunglasses for fashion,"They actually make them in three sizes. 49, 51 and 57. And the folders have a slightly different fit to them as well"
8594,best toothpaste,How do you know who I am? Don't ever call this number again.
66799,best soccer team in the world,"Even if they are this is valuation of 23 player squad and their club performances, age, club, lesgue etc. It doesn't really reflect on which team would beat which. It's simply not related to that."
1534,best ice cream flavor,I'm not sure actually. I had it once in a Japanese restaurant and it was delicious. The aftertaste was similar to that of coffee ice cream.
8337,best toothpaste,"I was literally wondering why the advice for bloody & swollen gums wasn't to floss, too...

A good flossing regimen when you've let (or genetically) your gums start to show signs basically looks like a week of painful bloody flossing that feels miserable, followed by a week where you'll have almost no blood and the puffiness will be down if not gone, and by week 3 you'll wonder why you haven't been doing that all along.

Gum and mouth tissue are some of *thee* quickest healing bodily tissues. A bit of pain, but likely profound health gain."
71902,best movies with a cool twist,">>!The noise that wakes Kidman up at the beginning is a gunshot!<

What does that imply? Been awhile since I've seen it."
25541,best cricket teams of all time,"but if my keeper can average 50+ at a s/r of 80+ in tests, then he can be as bad a catcher as Munaf Patel, I'd still rather have him."
35675,best alcoholic drink,Jack and Depression.
10246,best pencil for drawing,My dad gave me some uni Mitsubishi leadholders from his drafting days. I love leadholders for drawing 10x more than a general mechanical pencils because of the thicker lead options. They're plastic bodied but have held up.
33879,best Pokemon game,"All, or at least one per release are worth playing. As for the best, that's gen 5(the sequels have more content but the full experience is better)."
61236,Best RPG game on PS4,"Definitely more weapons and builds/playstyles. It takes some getting used to gameplay-wise. I wouldn't call it clunkier, just requiring more patience and being a bit slower-paced. 

There's also more NPC questlines (Like Eileen the Crow and Alfred in Bloodborne) in DS1 if you care about that stuff.

If you loved Bloodborne, you'll definitely enjoy the Dark Souls games"
19022,best YouTube video,I agree. Good to see when people send him locks and he spends more time ripping the packaging off then actually picking the lock.
69333,best major to study in college,Mind sharing what you are doing now for a living? I am also interested in taking up math in uni!
28887,best breakfast foods,"I get these Kirkland nut bars from Costco. Pretty good in terms of fiber and protein vs sugar, also no preparation, no clean-up, and portable."
67118,best places to skydive in california,"I know it's not all bad, and Dan BC is absolutely one of the GOATs, but I do have friends who have jumped at Perris who say they'll only jump Elsinore now. I know it's most likely not the instructors and coaches, because they do have a great student program, but it lies mostly with the more experienced fun jumpers. At Elsinore, I have tons of friends with 500+ jumps who love jumping with the 50 jump sky god that is me, but I've never been so I can't really say anything"
54301,best medicine for a cold,hey man just did this n wow it works. thank you
23245,best car racing video game,"it gets ridiculous.  the amount of tracks is amazing.  tons of touge track, whole seasons of F1, there's even offroad rally mods last I saw.  it's pretty awesome but some stuff will be buggy as well, such is the world of free mods."
42142,movies like Inception,We all do
66740,best soccer team in the world,That would be an interesting squad.
8495,best toothpaste,"Hey tarter, get back in line! You know the deal. Crazy-ass tarter..."
