Quick remedy is gargling salt water three times a day and that should loosen it up enough to cough it up at some point. Warning  though, if you do, don't crush it as it smells like shit and decay

8337,"I was literally wondering why the advice for bloody & swollen gums wasn't to floss, too...

A good flossing regimen when you've let (or genetically) your gums start to show signs basically looks like a week of painful bloody flossing that feels miserable, followed by a week where you'll have almost no blood and the puffiness will be down if not gone, and by week 3 you'll wonder why you haven't been doing that all along.
