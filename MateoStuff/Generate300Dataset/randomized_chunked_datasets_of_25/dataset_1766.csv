39240,best web browser,"if you want to maximize anonimity and privacy i would use 2 browsers. one for logging into personal accounts and sensitive info, and one for only browsing and then wiping your data after you close it (duckduckgo is made for this). But if you dont care about privacy at all, test different ones, check out reviews, forums about certain browsers and just stick to the one you like. firefox and brave seem to be the best for privacy, but brave recently had a scandal with data selling which is obviously something to consider. opera is a cool web browser but dont use it they sell your data lol. vivaldi seems to have cool features and they dont sell your data since they are a very small team. ive never searched/used edge enough to tell you about it."
