My buddy leaned over and told me that he wanted to compliment him on this band shirt he wore when making Clueless, but he ""didn't want it to be weird"". So his solution was to write him a note and slip it to him, lol. So he does this, and Paul just gets this nervous look on his face, opens the note and reads it. Starts cracking up laughing, leaned over to us and said ""best note ever"". He then told us the whole story of the shirt, how he fought with the costume dept about it because it was the shirt he wore to set that day. We talked the whole flight, dude was super cool.

eXistenz is way, way up there. Jude Law plays a bodyguard to a woman who has designed an Inception-tier virtual reality video game. Waaaay too cool. 

Videodrome is less of a ""whoa it was Earth all along"" kind of mindfuck, but the Ex Machina kind of slow burn as the film's philosophy start falling into place. 

The Fly, obviously, but it's only a mindfuck if the only other movie you've seen with Jeff Goldblum starts with the phrase ""Jurassic Park.""",movies like Inception
