60212,best freezer brand,"Kitchenaid!! We work on Samsung fridges every single day and they are riddled with class action lawsuits, especially for their ice makers. 

We might work on only a dozen Kitchenaid fridges a YEAR. 

There are so many more dissatisfied Samsung owners than satisfied. 

Stay away from Samsung, LG and Kenmore!!"
23281,best car racing video game,what CPU?
6329,best Netflix documentary,"Blackfish, not sure if still on Netflix though."
53829,best medicine for a cold,"1 bottle of nyquill night time formula.  1 bottle of Black Velvet (pick what you want, I use this) drink nyquil first, then mix liquor with hot tea.

Take 1 comforter and wrap yourself in the mummy wrap either in bed or on the couch.  Best if you are wearing long clothes but naked is ok too.

Watch television and drink liquored up tea until falling asleep, normally I watch the Godfather trilogy.  When I wake a day or some later, I am feeling better, and drink a gallon of water. 

The end."
