23754,"Gotta be 60hz and arcadey for me. Ever since Ridge Racer and Daytona in the arcades, less than 60fps has been unacceptable for this genre. Racing is one genre that I tend to prefer on console to PC though - with a gamepad and big TV. (And the 'arcade racing' genre was never very big on PC anyway)

Loved OutRun 2. Thoroughly enjoyed Burnout 2+3+Paradise. And Mario Kart games are always great for local multiplayer.

Also loved the first Trackmania game on PC, IMHO they went downhill when they came out with the stadium stuff (less precise control, too much speed, seen-it-all-before?), but they're still good fun in short bursts.

Not a whole lot of recent stuff there though... have I missed anything good?... I wish the Burnout series was still going, really. My only recent racing purchase has been FAST RMX for the Switch, which is pretty cool, but not cars.",best car racing video game

57276,"if you're such a worry wort, you should just stop drinking everything except for perfectly ph neutral distilled water without any added compounds.  oh wait, you'd DIE if you did that.  because you NEED minerals in order to live.  so stop being such a worry wart.  ph 3 vs ph7 isn't going to kill you.  neither is a 0.6ppm vs a 0.1ppm water that contains fluorine.  at this point, we don't have enough knowledge to say that drinking acidic water every day is going to kill you faster vs a ph neutral water.  and the same goes for drinking water that has higher ppm of this or that.  with your mindset, you probably shouldn't even be drinking coffee.  because some research somewhere has shown drinking coffee is bad.  just like i'm sure you've seen some research somewhere that says a higher ppm of this or that is bad for you, which has got you all tangled up in a rut.",best water brand
