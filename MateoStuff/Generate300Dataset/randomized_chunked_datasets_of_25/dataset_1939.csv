68562,best science fiction novel,"I didn’t like that book very much either. But it did give us the word grok, so that’s something."
4547,best text editor,"I suspect so, but haven't seen evidence of it myself. 

Will have to take a peek over at VSCodium repo someday to see exactly all what it is they are removing from it.  Simply disabling telemetry is enough for me, and that is more for performance reasons than privacy concerns."
10718,best suitcase lock,Extra tip at the end you may not have seen; Starter pistols and flare guns count as firearms.  So you can get a cheap starter pistol without any need for a gun permit.

67018,best places to skydive in california,"I agree, boogies are better suited for those current and on their toes. I went to a boogie earlier in the year. I was doing a 4-way wingsuit flight and I was confused to find a few belly jumpers falling past us, especially knowing that we were the last people out of the plane. Turns out they were from the next load that left after my load took off. My load did a go-around and I guess the next load behind us did not get the message...."
60793,Best comedy show on Netflix,Tig Notaro’s Happy to be Here and Neal Brennan’s 3 Mics are both great. I also like Joe Rogan. He is smart.
68853,best science fiction novel,"If we're including fantasy, Sanderson's Stormlight books outta be on that list."
33372,best electric car,"Was looking for this.

I'm just waiting on my loan money coming through then one of them is mine.

Got the Exclusive Model for a little over £24k, with heaps getting taken off due to the Government Grant and their Affinity programme they're doing.

A 250+ Mile EV for that price is an absolute bargain."

18488,best YouTube video,I remember showing my dad that video in second grade because I thought it was the funniest shit ever. He didn't agree.
65990,best college in california,"Forbes also said that UC Davis was better than UChicago, CalTech, Johns Hopkins and Brown.

Forbes is not a reliable metric to find the ""best"" schools. It's a niche ranking looking for the most ""bang for your buck"" school. It's pretty good for the latter."

37875,best Marvel movie,"I guess you're the one who's right and everyone else is wrong, huh? You're incredibly dense and arrogant.

""If I don't think the movie is top five, no one does. Now watch me ignore all the evidence that proves me wrong."""
34305,best NFL player,"I mean he missed 11 games in 2019, so he’s been great 2018-2020 (when he plays). So he gets punished because he wasn’t great as a rookie and a sophomore? (he was great the last 5 games of his sophomore year)."
35935,best alcoholic drink,I'll be ordering fingers of whiskey next weekend if the bars don't have Diet 7Up. Whiskey is a great low calorie drink but hangovers are dependent on the person.
