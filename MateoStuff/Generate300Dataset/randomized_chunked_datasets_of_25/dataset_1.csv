As I was leaving the Planet Fitness, it looked like he was walking in. We made eye contact, so I stopped and held the door for him. He got to the door and stopped right before he walked through, in one of those fake poses that little kids make when you tell them to freeze. I stood there holding the door, plenty confused. For about five seconds, we just stood there- him, motionless and I, standing there holding the door. Finally, he turned his head and said in the stereotypical Adam Sandler voice, ""Ahhh, who we kidding? I'm not going in there!"" Giant grin on his face. We both laughed and then he continued down the street. 

Awesome.",best celebrity

Spends a lot of her weekends going to museums and galleries.  Can't find a job in what she wants to do.  Has an entry level position as an office administrator and she hates it.  Can't really move up much in her company because she doesn't have the knowledge of the industry shes in.
