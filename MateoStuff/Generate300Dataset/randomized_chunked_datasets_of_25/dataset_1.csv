20227,best workout music,"Till I Collapse - Eminem

I am unstoppable when this comes on in my playlist."
22360,best celebrity,"I ran into Adam Sandler outside of a Planet Fitness in Brooklyn in early 2016. 

As I was leaving the Planet Fitness, it looked like he was walking in. We made eye contact, so I stopped and held the door for him. He got to the door and stopped right before he walked through, in one of those fake poses that little kids make when you tell them to freeze. I stood there holding the door, plenty confused. For about five seconds, we just stood there- him, motionless and I, standing there holding the door. Finally, he turned his head and said in the stereotypical Adam Sandler voice, ""Ahhh, who we kidding? I'm not going in there!"" Giant grin on his face. We both laughed and then he continued down the street. 

Awesome."
58456,best cologne,we've all been there
10130,best pencil for drawing,"You're both wrong. And right.

Pencils don't matter if you don't know how to use them properly. The problem is amateurs don't know how, and it causes their work to suffer greatly."
28511,best breakfast foods,"I keep a bunch of chopped, mostly cooked bacon in the fridge. In the morning I mix a bit in with some eggs, scramble them together & wrap them in a tortilla like a burrito. 

I eat it in the car on the way to work with a cup of OJ & then get a cup of coffee when I get to the office."
58414,best cologne,"I honestly like the smell of a man's sweat but not for too long..

It tends to get sickening if it's been too long since the last shower."

12436,best gifts for mom,"My mom has always hated vacuuming, so my brother and I went in on a Roomba for Christmas last year. She loves that thing."
16484,best sunglasses for fashion,"Thanks! I think part of the problem is that I ride/drive a car and most of the vehicles where I live (in Texas) are these super big trucks and SUVs. Most of the people legit have their brights (or high beams) on when driving around town and because I am in a car, the headlights are all at eye level. So thanks for sharing. I had never heard of some of these lens coatings."
4764,best home improvement store,"Lowe's for the 5% discount if you use their credit card. 

I do think HD has a much superior tooling selection, as well as flooring."
54180,best medicine for a cold,"And ibuprofen is not one of the NSAIDs that will fuck up your liver if taken with alcohol?  I know acetaminophen/paracetamol does and aspirin doesn't, but I can never remember with naproxen and ibuprofen.

Aspirin is the only one that seems to work for me anyway, so I suppose it doesn't matter, but I like to know."
70456,best major to study in college,"It's the same as elementary statistics except with calculus; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time. Also, be open to do programming as that will give you even more job/internships opportunities. R and Python are probably the top two.

You can look up ""probability theory"" to see what calculus plays a role in statistics, that course is the toughest one for most Stats programs."

Miss the heyday of energy drinks when there were more and more flavors everyday"
26066,best politician,"Yeah, but that this to be expected on this sub. Threads like these always set off the libertarian/populist democrat core of this sub. They probably did call in the cavalry though

However, this particular post has a much more significant drop."
7416,best laptop for general use,"Yes, the Swift X is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there. The Legion 5 15"" is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life.

It could always go on sale later on, but I don't know for certain."

Spends a lot of her weekends going to museums and galleries.  Can't find a job in what she wants to do.  Has an entry level position as an office administrator and she hates it.  Can't really move up much in her company because she doesn't have the knowledge of the industry shes in.  She went to a private university for it and will be paying off loans for a longgg time.
70405,best major to study in college,"As a business major, I wish I would've trusted myself and studied economics. I'm minoring in econ right now and those classes are so much more interesting than my business classes"
