El-P - Cancer4Cure
Heltah Skeltah - Nocturnal
Lootpack- Sound Pieces: Da Antidote
Random Axe - Random Axe
Sean Price - Monkey Barz (and all of his other albums pretty much)
Notorious BIG - Ready to Die

Among so many others"
73759,best matte screen protector for ipad,"That was my intention but it is difficult to show on camera. 

After coming back to the Paperlike for a day, I think that the issue with the paperlike is the way it absorbs and disperses light. If I‚Äôm sitting in a dark room like I‚Äôm doing right now, it doesn‚Äôt look that bad. In hindsight, I probably should have taken comparison shots of how it looks like with light behind me. It‚Äôs especially noticeable on darker backgrounds.

This is my last Paperlike so I don‚Äôt really want to remove it to make a comparison with the other one that I have, but here‚Äôs a picture when the lights are on and the brightness up on full:

47805,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I don‚Äôt know the reason why. Maybe it‚Äôs just to get the pass rate of Calc 1 and Calc 2 as high as possible? Because Calc 2 is a huge bottleneck for so many majors and the fail rate is quite high. 

So maybe it‚Äôs just so the students all have a tool at their disposal that can help them pass. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

25770,best cricket teams of all time,"Doctoring wickets? That is a little extreme. Indian pitches have predominantly been either flat or rank turners. Teams visiting India will not be used to the conditions doesn't mean all Indian pitches are doctored. Having followed test cricket for three decades i can tell you whenever India goes abroad, they are invited with green tops. It is called home advantage and everyone does that. Aus playing Eng, SA, NZ, Wi will be different coz attacks are similar and so will be the pitches."
