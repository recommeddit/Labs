The Princess Bride
"This will get buried but it works. 

Hot food. Nothing kills a cold or sinus infection faster for me than eating very very spicy food."
Actually yeah. It’s about a 4.5 hour flight followed by a 1 hour drive. Expect 6-7 hours total. Not bad at all.
"Disney’s Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida. It’s so fancy and the monorail passes through it (no, it’s not loud). You also get a view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks! There are fun pools and restaurants and gift shops and spas and honestly you could spend a whole day there just exploring!"
Peasant.
"I second this, I absolutely love this series. Great protagonist and a strong sense of adventure as you follow Paks."
It's about the best thing out as far as web cams go. Unless you wanna go camlink.
"Oh no, just imagine the green car hitting you at 200 km/h in VR!
Saatana!"
"Yes, carbon's scent is very similar to Dior Sauvage, but without the harshness from the ambroxan."
Damn I didn't think dads gonna require gifts for each of this lol
Andrew W.K. x 100
"lobby politics.
today i read first time about nnn. had lunch and a coffee'fe. 
maybe it's because i configured ranger to my needs. maybe because i didn't read everything. 
maybe tomorrow. maybe"
"Absolute rubbish. I suspect these polls present a complete biased towards the demographic that uses rateyourmusic, and that's it. Ironically, it think it maps over pretty well for the avg Reddit Hip Hop fan."
"ATLiens is def. up there, the production is dope af"
":D Thanks! Another tip is: buy your first bottle from the retailer that helped you, because they deserve it for helping you.  
Buy only a small or medium bottle, though. For all subsequent bottles, get the largest size you can from Amazon if they have it. (They carry most designer brands). They are legit, but so much cheaper."
"I don't like her or her music,  buy it's catchy and was played EVERYWHERE. This is my reasons for knowing the lyrics."
Working out to Sabaton? Brutal!
"I definitely agree, although based on the quality of the titles and the order I assumed this was just a list rather than a ranking.

I would definitely say A Fire Upon the Deep was far superior in scope, vision, and depth than Ancillary Justice, for instance."
"For a while in school, I really got into the [Great Northern War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_War) of 1700-1721. If you like reading descriptions of battles where Scandinavians face off against Russians along frozen rivers with cool-sounding names, this is the war for you."
Rats make awesome pets. But they don't live very long.
"**Arkansas**

Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, AR is a must-see.  

Eureka Springs, AR is a very unique town with a spooky haunted hotel.  

Hot Springs, AR for the horse races, Garvan Gardens, and the hot springs.

Floating the Buffalo River has absolutely beautiful scenery."
"If there's an Intercontinental in Cabo, I recommend it. I've stayed in the one in Puerto Rico and it was AMAZING! Wifi everywhere, the beach was wonderful, lots of little restaurants near by. Old San Juan was just a bus ride away and was absolutely beautiful! I've only heard good things from friends and family staying at Intercontinental Hotel/Resorts in many different countries. When I plan my honeymoon with my fiance, I'm going to try my hardest to stay at one again."
Dude. Th. Fucking saved.
"NJ, I'd say either the boardwalk at night in the summer, or a top notch Italian place somewhere around Essex county."
"Thanks for the list.  I agree with most of your choices.  Knights Inn is the worst.  I naively booked one on a business trip and immediately checked out after getting a room with a cracked window, saggy bed, and reeking of patchouli.   The hoopties in the parking lot should have been a clue that I was in a sketchy place.   I drove around in my rental car until I found a decent hotel.  I would have slept in my car if necessary over staying at that Knights Inn.

I’m a fan of Embassy Suites.  I have had many good experiences there."
