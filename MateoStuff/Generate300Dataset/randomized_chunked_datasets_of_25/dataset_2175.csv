2352,best headphones,"I'd say bowers & Wilkins. They cost more than XM4 or Bose 700, but imo are worth it."
4262,best text editor,"Another vote for notepad++ from me.  I love how far this application has come.

I do some list management for email campaigns and routinely work with csv/delimited files that are anywhere from 200KB to 35MB in size (over 1.4 million email addresses, in the file I'm looking at now).  Doing a find/replace on this 35MB file does cause it to lock up--never really had to try that before--but otherwise most things are pretty fast as long as the file size isn't redonkulous.

If I'm doing something like crunching data that intensive, I'll generally bring it into Access anyway and run a query."
56415,best desktop monitor,"Which since they recommend the G7 over the alienware for gaming, that would make the G7 the #1 gaming monitor still."

58248,best cologne,"When a guy in the office or even on the street walks past me wearing Issey Miyake - l'eau d'issey pour homme, I can't resist stopping and giving him a blowjob."
18413,best YouTube video,Knock knock. It's the United States...with boats...and guns.....gunboats
49217,best gaming monitor,Stay the fuck away from Acer is my only advice. I got burned twice by their shit monitors and even worse by their customer service.
16139,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/sunglasses/men/barkley/oak-barrel) I personally got these, quality is very well and they range from 90-150 i believe."
19739,best YouTube video,Laser Collection. My entire 5th grade class was addicted to those videos. Itâ€™s been so long since then.
27107,best board games,"Itâ€™s a fun game. Thereâ€™s a TON going on near the end game and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. Plus, what your opponents do and have influence what you do, so thereâ€™s a fair amount of interaction. Also, itâ€™s a â€˜point saladâ€™ game, so you often donâ€™t know who will win until the very end - DRAMA!

Thereâ€™s a lot of little things wrong with it (Iâ€™m looking at you, player boards!), but itâ€™s a good game overall, well worth being on anyoneâ€™s game shelf."
59054,best perfume,"I second this. I was given a sample of this late last year and fell in love. Waiting for it to be on sale so I can buy a full size. It was long lasting but not overpowering, such a beautiful perfume."
59248,best perfume,Just a joke. Don't worry. We just feel our age sometimes.ðŸ˜Š
30146,best Mexican war to study,"My vague memory is that my school textbooks did describe the reasons for the war being shady and unethical.  But the actual conduct of the war was 'honorable' -- the US Army soundly defeated the Mexicans with solid strategy, superior tactics and equipment etc.  (General Grant in his memoirs described the Mexican Army as woefully underprepared for war in the 1840s but was much improved at the end of Grant's life (1880s)."

60077,best perfume,"They used to make an actual perfume too, instead of just a body spray, but I think it got discontinued sadly."
29061,best calendar tool,"Believe me, you're entering a world of pain with this question. There are so many terrible apps out there it's hard to find one you really like. I personally use google calendar + google tasks because to me it's the best calendar + to do list combination. 

I've used Asana and it's quite good, it really gives you a lot of functions that are great for a professional workflow. You can do things project-based, there's a calendar and it's especially useful if you work in a team. It's dirt cheap too, something like ten bucks a month (per team member as far as I remember)"
