4262,"Another vote for notepad++ from me.  I love how far this application has come.

I do some list management for email campaigns and routinely work with csv/delimited files that are anywhere from 200KB to 35MB in size (over 1.4 million email addresses, in the file I'm looking at now).  Doing a find/replace on this 35MB file does cause it to lock up--never really had to try that before--but otherwise most things are pretty fast as long as the file size isn't redonkulous.

If I'm doing something like crunching data that intensive, I'll generally bring it into Access anyway and run a query.",best text editor

27107,"Itâ€™s a fun game. Thereâ€™s a TON going on near the end game and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. Plus, what your opponents do and have influence what you do, so thereâ€™s a fair amount of interaction. Also, itâ€™s a â€˜point saladâ€™ game, so you often donâ€™t know who will win until the very end - DRAMA!

Thereâ€™s a lot of little things wrong with it (Iâ€™m looking at you, player boards!), but itâ€™s a good game overall, well worth being on anyoneâ€™s game shelf.",best board games

30146,"My vague memory is that my school textbooks did describe the reasons for the war being shady and unethical.  But the actual conduct of the war was 'honorable' -- the US Army soundly defeated the Mexicans with solid strategy, superior tactics and equipment etc.  (General Grant in his memoirs described the Mexican Army as woefully underprepared for war in the 1840s but was much improved at the end of Grant's life (1880s).",best Mexican war to study

I've used Asana and it's quite good, it really gives you a lot of functions that are great for a professional workflow. You can do things project-based, there's a calendar and it's especially useful if you work in a team. It's dirt cheap too, something like ten bucks a month (per team member as far as I remember)",best calendar tool
