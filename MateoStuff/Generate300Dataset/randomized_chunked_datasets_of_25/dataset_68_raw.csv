Yes. Very soft. Agreed there.
"In this case you have [other things to worry about](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water#Health_effects_of_drinking_purified_water)


>Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water which is not an ideal replacement for drinking water. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily absorbs them, and because the presence of calcium and magnesium in water can prevent absorption of lead and cadmium."
"Like I said, if you have the  money, go for it. but a $30 difference for people who don't have a lot."
"Yes, it was paint & primer and painting tools, and then a ton of these brackets that I needed for the installation of a chain link fence."
So Colgate Total's out then.
"I was at Baskin Robbins (ice cream place) with my friends, and one of them got a scoop as ""candy corn"" ice cream. We couldn't figure out what it would taste like. Wax? High Fructose corn syrup? It literally has no flavor."
"Well Microsoft said waaay back in 2007 that no new games would be added to the list.  So the list has been final for a long time now.  If it's not on the list, it'll never be supported.

The page was last modified a few days ago and is well-cited so I'd say it's current and reliable."
"Thanks for the rec, just tried it and it's fun!"
"I live in Wisconsin, the land of cheese. This is my favorite breakfast loadout, which serves a big breakfast for two:


* Open a can of corned beef hash and dump that shit on a hot skillet.
* Crack two eggs into the hot hash and mix until the eggs are cooked.
* Layer slices of pepperjack and cheddar cheese on the hashegg party.
* Slice a nice big, juicy tomato and briefly fry the slices on low heat. 
* Garnish with a scoop of cottage cheese.
* Big ass cup of coffee? Yes please!"
"Do you have crazy shenanigans with your twin brother? Jk, in all seriousness, do you enjoy it?"
"Taken orally, it is literally a placebo. Don’t waste your money."
"People will hire you as a junior if you have a solid mastery of SQL, (start learning SQL **now**) JavaScript, CSS and HTML. If someone put a picture in front of you and explained how it worked and you could build it within about 30mins to an hour.

In web development the following technologies you will want a ""ok"" understanding of after you understand JavaScript. At min be able to parrot the definitions of these things and explain how they fit into the world.

- Nodejs (master this)
- MongoDB 
- jQuery
- Angular
- React
- npm
- Apache Cordova
- Electron

After that learn TypeScript. The start diving into languages like PHP, Ruby, C#, and Python, Java, and Go. JavaScript fairly recently made it to server side programming. Most websites still run on PHP, and small development shops use it. Java and C# are used in very large enterprise-style projects and desktop application development. Ruby Python is used in places that are more conscious of the world around them like startups, young companies, R&D departments, and companies with very powerful websites for sales. These same companies are shift more and more to nodejs but for integration purposes and cross work you need to know more than just JS.  Go is moving into the webspace, but it really is more of a system language like C, C++, or Rust. Its kinda a wierd language that doesnt seem to stick with companies much untill they have scaling issues. Then they either fire or retrain all the devs to know Go and rewrite the whole system. Its not a great language for changing business requirements."
"[Was I supposed to get it after she says to her kid to talk to her dad because he knows science?](/spoiler)

Because that's when I figured it out.  So the final reveal to me was like ""oh that makes sense"" more than ""woah I didn't see that coming"""
"Tequila and rum.

Although, being that I am a fancy bitch, I have a soft spot for elderflower liqueur. It tastes amazing mixed with lemonade."
Mine had to be SFMM and it is my home park
"I'm really all over the place with that one. On the one hand I was bored, on the other hand, it's the first time I used my kindle's highlight feature. ""A crowd is not the sum of the individuals who compose it. Rather it is a species of animal, without language or real consciousness, born when they gather, dying when they depart."" I mean, damn."
"Weird as it sounds, you could go to a third wave shop in LA and ask them to refill like a 500ml or 1L water bottle with water (or hot water if you have an insulated bottle like a hydro flask), I do it whenever I go get coffee for home brewing. Granted, I don't drink or make coffee every day so it's a more practical solution for me. Pretty much every third wave shop has filtered water and they've never had a problem with me asking for hot water. (I get espresso or something beforehand though)"
"I feel like its the only fight it tried to put up haha.

I like how they still have arcade machines and salad bars too.  Reminds me of how Pizza hut used to be back in the day."
That's awesome. I also love the idea of a babymoon

Not really. They are putting Salman Khan lowest because he is an average actor and you are in denial. You still can't distinguish between stardom and acting skills. You don't have to have both skills to succeed in India.  Salman is a great box office pull but an average actor and no has influenced me and many other. It's you who can't comprehend that Salman is an average actor
Otsu v2 is smoother and a little faster.
Use DeleteContact from iArrays. It’s $0.99 but works well!
But a clean guy is so attractive. If you're clean and can compliment a girl (and are not ridiculously unattractive) you will get laid.
What was your major?
