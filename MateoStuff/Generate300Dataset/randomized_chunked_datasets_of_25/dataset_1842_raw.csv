Just wondering where than RedPocket $30 annual plan went on here. That's the one I'm on now that it's using the T-Mobile network.
LBJ for sure

"Depends on what you want, but most Verizon seems to have better coverage by a significant margin, the downside being that their plans are most expensive. T-Mobile and Sprint are combining soon, and Sprint towers are being upgraded or torn down, so it gives me hope, since I have t-mobile indirectly by using google fi."

Alright letâ€™s address the elephant in the room no one wants to defend bottled water....... but if Iâ€™m at the store and I gotta just grab one I almost always go for Aquafina or VOSS if itâ€™s available (and yes I just buy it because of the fancy bottle and that itâ€™s from Norway) but sort of that I just grab whatever is cheapest.

Peace Corps or some other organization where you spend time in a developing country would help. You have to prove you can deal with life over here.
"Excuse me, 4K is standard. 5K is the holy grail. But the actual problem is that the holy monitor grail for a gamer is something entirely different from the holy monitor grail for somebody working in the creative industry. I havenâ€™t seen 1440p since the mid 00s. 5K is the shit. I wouldnâ€™t even know or it was impossible to see at which Hz it is running. And why would I need to. (Itâ€™s 60 Hz for the 5K iMac btw)"
THE GAP...... BOOKS!
"Yes, but the ROI is insane.  My annual YNAB fee has saved me *thousands of dollars.*  

It blew mint away, which ultimately just nagged me but did not change my behavior one bit.  YNAB was like a brutal spiritual journey where I had to confront my own consumerism and come to terms with the idea that desire is infinite and will never be satiated no matter what I bought, but my bank accounts are most definitely finite.  It sucked.  But now I'm debt free and have a six month buffer and am saving for a house.  YNAB will make me rich, someday.

Oh, it also made my marriage stronger.  We are literally on the same page financially.  That also took some time to get there but it was worth every single squabble and compromise."

"I've personally always been a fan of Xbox. It's where many of my friends are, and I love some of the games.

I also have a PS4, but don't really use it much....mainly for a few of the exclusives.

I enjoyed Nintendo as a kid, but kinda ""grew out"" of many of those games. There's still a few that I'd love to try, but my tastes have changed.

PC is going to give the best graphics, won't charge for online, and has a large variety of games available.

.

Really, it's going to come down to what type of games you want to play.

If you already have a PC, I'd probably stick with that for the short term, and figure out which genre of games you enjoy the most.

Once you decide that it will be easier to figure out which console to get - as they really shine in different areas.

If you don't have a PC currently, I'd recomend the Xbox One S. It's a nice console, and probably one of the cheapest options currently.

.

Next Gen consoles are probably \~18 months out at this point.

So, I wouldn't go spending a ton of money on any current gen console if you think you'll want to get into next-gen."
This. JetBrains products are very good and reasonably priced but VS Code is 98+% as good and it's hard to be more reasonably priced than free.
Thank you!! Iâ€™ll check them out. :)
