42424,"Hey, I have a similar taste in Movies like you :D Here are some that I watched already, with a Comment from me:
""Identity"" from 2003 with John Cusack and Ray Liotta. Quite good. Not perfect, but a good Film.
""Mindgame"", an Anime Movie from 2004. That Film is really crazy. In a awesome Way.
At this point I have to recommend the criminally overseen ""Mr.Nobody"" from  2009. It's one of my All-time Favourite Movies, with Jared Leto in the lead Role. Stunning and really, really complex. Sadly it flopped hard.
""Being John Malkovich"" from Spike Jonze. Didn't like it too much, but a decent Film.
Try ""Brazil"" from Terry Gilliam, an absolute Blast!
""Vanilla Sky"" with Tom Cruise. Pretty good Movie, the Endtwist is great.
As for Comedies like ""Airplane"", I would recommend you the ""Hot Shots"" Movies, with Charlie Sheen and ""Top Secret"" with Val Kilmer.  Comedy Gold! :D",movies like Inception

65877,"The University of California is also the most welcoming to war criminals.

John Yoo wrote the ""torture memos"" declaring torture to be just peachy keen and perfectly legal.  He also gave the OK for indefinite detention of enemy combatants.

He's now a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.

Yoo also authored the October 23, 2001 memo asserting that the President had sufficient power to allow the NSA to monitor the communications of US citizens on US soil without a warrant (known as the warrantless wiretap program) because the Fourth Amendment does not apply. Or, as another memo says in a footnote, ""Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations.""

The only reason to drop money is because you really want a character, but the game does a decent job at giving you everything you possibly need. And there are guides out there that can show you how to excel with a F2P team. There is a lot to do and explore before taking on the “end-game” which is pretty much only Spiral Abyss (think kind of like an endless dungeon where you keep fighting until you lose). But since there is no PvP, there isn’t an incentive beyond that to pay.",best iOS game

I also learned there were a lot of opponents to this act. I believe Lincoln and Henry Thoreau are the two I remember specifically.
