17870,best Kardashian,"Least fav currently is Khloe bc she’s so mean and hypocritical now. Fav was Kourtney bc I stan and underdog and that’s what she was with Kim and Khloe picking on her so much. I also appreciate that she hasn’t had as much work done and I’m not a huge fan of the plastic surgery/filler look. I hate the way she treats staff though, but most rich people do that shit, so maybe none of them are my fav now?"
35520,best alcoholic drink,"We did one of those in a bar after the US won a big World Cup game in 2010. Except we did the car bomb, followed by a jaeger bomb, followed by a pint of beer. Yea. The bar staff filmed it to put on their website, but the bar is closed now."

36628,best alcoholic drink,"Before my uncle died of ALS he used to make ""Apple Pie Moonshine"" in his shed. I had heard of moonshine, but not this variety.

It was like drinking a warm slice of apple pie. Barely any bite, even though it was something like 150 proof. That was a dangerous jug he kept on his shelf."

9570,best toothpaste,"I’m actually allergic to SLS and it’s a bitch finding products without it. 

It’s put in nearly every toothpaste, shampoo or soap for its foaming property, which people associate with “clean” but don’t realize it’s a harsh detergent. 

Orally, I get mouth ulcers if I use a toothpaste containing SLS more than once or twice. Topically, shampoos with SLS worsened my seborrheic eczema, until I figured out that it aggravated my skin too. 

But, people like that “cleaning” foam/lather, so it’s not going away."

Planet of the Damned

Planet of No Return

All five books are by Harry Harrison. Super action packed. But are a product of their time. Be forwarned. Also, pretty much all of the stuff by H. Beam Piper. Also, The Gap Saga by Stephen R. Donaldson. That's pretty crazy. And if you want horror sci fi, go with Veniss Underground by Vandermeer. I can't recommend that book enough."
