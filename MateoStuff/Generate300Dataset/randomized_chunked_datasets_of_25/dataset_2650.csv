I hate the way she treats staff though, but most rich people do that shit, so maybe none of them are my fav now?",best Kardashian

9570,"I’m actually allergic to SLS and it’s a bitch finding products without it. 

It’s put in nearly every toothpaste, shampoo or soap for its foaming property, which people associate with “clean” but don’t realize it’s a harsh detergent. 

Orally, I get mouth ulcers if I use a toothpaste containing SLS more than once or twice. Topically, shampoos with SLS worsened my seborrheic eczema, until I figured out that it aggravated my skin too. 

But, people like that “cleaning” foam/lather, so it’s not going away.",best toothpaste

All five books are by Harry Harrison. Super action packed. But are a product of their time. Be forwarned. Also, pretty much all of the stuff by H. Beam Piper. Also, The Gap Saga by Stephen R. Donaldson. That's pretty crazy. And if you want horror sci fi, go with Veniss Underground by Vandermeer. I can't recommend that book enough.",best action and adventure novel series
