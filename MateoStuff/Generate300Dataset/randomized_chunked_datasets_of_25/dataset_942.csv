68715,"Idk what really defines sci fi entirely but id like to think a top three personally would be some pretty significant titles. They all are more or less focused on war and humanity but id say *The Forever war, Starship Troopers,* as well as *I-Robot* would be significant additions to any list. Aside from that some guilty pleasures of mine are The ender books both main story and the shadow spin offs and this awesome pick up of *Terms of Enlistment*",best science fiction novel

> UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition, behind the European Cup (later the UEFA Champions League) and ahead of the Fairs Cup (later the UEFA Cup). Therefore, a team qualified for both the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the European Cup, whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the Cup Winners' Cup. Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded the Cup Winners' Cup as weaker than the UEFA Cup, which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues.",best soccer team in the world

I've already said in this thread, but the movie going experience was far superior for Endgame, but then when I re-examined both movies during the holiday, i just felt that everything Endgame did, Infinity War did better.

60959,I guess I'd call it innocent. It's a British comedy that made fun of science fiction tropes and it started in the late 80's on a non-existent budget. It's relies heavily on the few characters in the show for its comedy. It can be clever but it's also consistently very silly in a way that I only see in British comedy. It never takes itself seriously and I love it for that.,Best comedy show on Netflix
