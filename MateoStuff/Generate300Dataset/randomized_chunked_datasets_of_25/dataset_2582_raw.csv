"A brilliant choice. What's more, you can purchase 24 hr access to the PDF of Olson's review article for only $32.00!"
"If you're prone to canker sores use Toms. It's twice as expensive but it works. The foaming agent in other brands can cause canker sores if you're already prone to them and is unnecessary because the foaming is only there because people think it does something. 

My dentist recommended it and I previously had at least one at all times. Now I only get them if I bite my lip/cheek or if I don't brush my teeth."
"It's a high demand field, but it *is* a lot of work. Still, my CS degree has served me well for a long time."
"well considering the 1650 right now is 350-400 id disagree. Also the rx570 was 100-170 now its 250-400 so again, id disagree. No GPU right now is good value unless you get lucky. Its insane how much these GPU costs right now. 1050ti should not be 300 bucks. You cant get 60fps 1080p on low with that card unless its a game from 2016 and under. 1650  is not much better. Im sorry but 300-400 and id just go get a damn ps4 or hell a ps5 if you can find one. Building a pc also requires other parts so in the end you will be paying 800-1000 bucks for ps4 pro performance yeah no fucking thank you."
"I buy Canadian sensodyne with Novamin, a drug the US FDA ~~doesn’t allow~~ hasn’t yet reviewed and allowed, through Amazon. Shit is unbelievable!"
"How many of these alcoholic drinks are you planning on having? Do you like sugar-rush coolers? Are you drinking shite beer like coors or bud? Or decent ale that doesn't have preservatives? 

I can't see how a glass of wine with dinner or an ale after work is really that bad... though a six pack a day may undo your six pack.

Then again I have no idea about any of this. I'm just some guy with a keyboard."
"The captain needs more love, he's been on YT for OVER 10 YEARS, 10 YEARS!!! 
And he has never slumped it's always been high quality high production value content for 10 years straight and he only just reached a million subs!

For the uninformed he basically debunks fake viral videos by showing how the digital effects were done in a very enticing and Bombastic way.
There's also a running story line and recurring characters in his videos. 
It's all very entertaining and educational and helps you spot fake viral videos wayyyy quicker...

Which means you get to be the person who destroys their friends lives by telling them that the thing they enjoyed is a big load of fake!

Yaaaaay!"
I can't help but read/see this as some sort of sex role play thing between the two.
"Goodr.  I cannot say enough good things about them. I bought a pair, they're $25. They have funny names, weird colors, and work and look great. 

They do fit on the snugger side as they are geared towards runners, so the tighter fit helps prevent them from slipping around on the face.

"Funny thing is, GTA actually has a decent car community. People have learned the ins and outs of the engine and can do some pretty rad stuff. Mods are also cool"
A stout or porter. Always go for a stout first though

"My recommendation is a [Northface Vault](http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/ca_ecom/engear/vault-backpack_2.html)

I bought mine freshman year of college.  So far it has survived 4 years of college and 2 years of law school.  Especially in the last two years, I have put that poor backpack through more than it should be expected to handle, and it's holding up perfectly.  I'm not actually sure what I can do to it to destroy it, if it can handle all of my law books and Lenovo on a regular basis."

"Wayne Coyne. Talks to you like a human-being and really, gives all his attention to whoever he's speaking to at the moment. I was talking to him with a line waiting behind me but there was no rush; we must've talked for about 10 minutes, with his eyes locked in conversation the entire time and showing genuine appreciation for compliments and interest for what you have to say. 
Met him a second time backstage, really energetic. He goes right from his performance to chatting with the dancers. It's like he's always ready to do the next thing, nothing seems to bother him, just a really optimistic, cheerful guy."
"I ordered a red iphone 11 last week, can’t wait to pick it up next week. Finally getting rid of my 6s."
"The fucking Shrike, that thing still haunts my dreams and its been probably around 7 years since I have read it."
"Firefox is not an abandoned project, I gave you two pieces of evidence that Firefox is still maintained and was not killed in 2017 as you say, which is obviously false. Your various comments where you said that have downvoted. Am I supposed to take you seriously?"
Ake looks really young. But he is actually turning 27 this February
Probably not the best but I love Romancing the Stone
I've decided to not read any more of your posts ever. Ride or die with Tay.
"I don't like IDE's because of the bloat that comes with them, but I can see the allure.  The built in debug suite that comes with Visual Studio (last used it like 3 years ago I think) is really really nice.

I work in vim combined with ctags, and I normally mix this with tmux. You can compile and do all that fun stuff in vim on it's own, but I like having tmux at the aid.  I started tmux a while back so that I wouldn't lose ongoing work on machines I had to ssh into, but I've got used to building using in with multipane set ups."
Its pretty much confirmed. A lot of leaks showed it.
