30549,best Mexican war to study,">Our first excursion, as a nation, onto foreign soil.

Um, that isn't true. 

Edit: Unless Sandwich, Canada wasn't foreign in July of 1812. And also as long as we are not counting Marines landing and fighting on North African or Sumatran soil. Both these things happened prior to Veracruz."

26626,best board games,"Before you buy anything, I'd STRONGLY urge you to head to your nearest FLGS to try the game prior to buying. Also, keep in mind 
 - your friends/family may really dislike a game you absolutely love, so it may rarely be played (I'm looking at you Camp Grizzly). 

That in mind, I've had the most success playing the following with in-laws and random acquaintances.

* **Sushi Go** - Quick, fun, cheap, easy to find, and easy to teach/learn. This is the game my in-laws always ask to play when they come over. 

* **Kings of Tokyo** - A mid-priced game, but still really simple, easy to find, and a lot of fun. It's basically a form of yahtzee, but you get to play as movie monsters. 

* **Pandemic** (Any non-legacy version) - There are multiple types of Pandemic, and they're all great. If it is your first time playing, I would probably stay away from Legacy (Season 1 or 2); even though, they are both great games. Oddly, my family most enjoys the Cthulhu version. 

* **Barenpark** - This is a simple to learn build-your-own tableau game. There is limited competition, and I've usually found everyone really happy at the end of the game - win or lose.

* **One Deck Dungeon** - This is a bit of an oddity for me. I think the game is alright, but my wife and sister-in-law *LOVE* this game. I don't quite get why they like it so much, but regardless, I'm out-voted, so it sees regular play.

* **Dungeon Roll** - This is the game we ""settle"" on when I can't take any more One Deck Dungeon. It's simple, quick, and addictive dice rolling game that everyone enjoys.

* **Small World** - a.k.a. ""Fancy Risk"" by my father-in-law. I really like this game, and I've taught and played it countless times with friends a family. I'd strongly recommend this as one of your first ""major"" purchases.

* **Jaipur** - a.k.a. ""The Camel Game"" by most of my family. It's a cheap and simple set collection game built for two people, but we regularly play teams of two. 

* **Friday** - Sometimes, you'll have nobody to play with, and this is why I'd strongly suggest Friday. It's cheap, easy to learn, challenging, and fun; however, it's built for only one player.

* **Tiny Epic _________** - There are several ""Tiny Epic X"" games out there, and they're all really good and fairly priced. I'd start with Tiny Epic Galaxies (as it is the easiest to learn and most played in my house); however, my favorite is Tiny Epic Western. 

* **Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** - Another oddity on my list, but this time, my father-in-law and I are the ones who love this game, while everyone else just tolerates it. It's a game that requires quite a bit of set-up and thinking, so it isn't for everyone."
34902,best NFL player,I disagree. He only threw 33 tds last year. He had a pretty great season but it wasn't MVP level at all
27115,best board games,"I'll give some positives, but keep in mind I don't think SU&SD are wrong, I just don't think it's their type of game.


- Trying to work out which cards you can afford to keep, what your opponents might want from your current draft hand, watching the tracks tick up and trying to figure out if you can pull your plan off this turn ... an awesome little puzzle each round. 

- Narrative: We name our Corporations things like ""Evil Corp."", or ""The Tree Huggers"" and the stories that just organically flow out of the cards you choose to play, if you nuke the planet, etc. lead to some really great memories. 


- Your colony/corp really feels like your own, and unique from the others. Each game can be really different based on card draw/draft, and how each player chooses to approach those cards and the board state.


Watch some positive reviews, then watch the SU&SD one again. Maybe it will change your mind, or maybe you will realize that you were right to trust their impression."

60733,Best comedy show on Netflix,"My taste trends towards the mentally ill haha so Bo Burnham (I've watched Make Happy soooo many times) and Maria Bamford are top favs. And ""Nanette"" by Hannah Gadsby is barely stradling the line of stand up comedy but I loved it. 

On a less downer note, seconding John Mulaney, and Mike Birbiglia is the man."

40201,best midrange CPU,"TLDW:

Category | CPU | Cores | Price
----|-----|---:|---:
Best overall gaming | Intel 10600K | 6 | $280
Best budget gaming | AMD 3300X | 4 |$120
Best all-around | AMD 3600 | 6 | $170

I think the most interesting fact here is that not a single 8-core CPU made the list."

47832,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,">Iâ€™ve looked pretty hard myself for any sort of apps and never found anything that great.

SAME! I don't really understand it. Multivariable graphing is not *that* esoteric in the scheme of things, we are hardly the first to have wanted to do it. So why are there not more offerings, even outside of the free realm?

The best thing I've found thus far is [Quick Graph](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-graph/id292412367), which isn't *bad*, but the user experience just isn't as seamless as with Desmos, nor do the input capabilities seem as flexible, and I find it a bit difficult to precisely rotate my functions. It's got great reviews though, so maybe I just need to spend more time with it.

I was just wondering if there were any obvious winners that I had somehow missed..."
60428,Best comedy show on Netflix,Derry Girls is fantastic. I watch with subtitles.
37477,best amusement park,"Agreed, this is the company to watch going Into the 20â€™s .  In my opinion they are sparing no expense this season, with just about every park getting a major new coaster,  and 2021 being every bit as good based on what Iâ€™ve read."
