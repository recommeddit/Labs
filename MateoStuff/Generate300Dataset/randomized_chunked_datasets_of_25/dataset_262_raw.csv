"As a mexican... avoid mexican made hand sanitizers. Many don't even have the required level of alcohol the FDA requires(of course because they have no jurisdiction here) and the FDA has pretty low standards on the global scale to be honest. I try to buy the german stuff only whenever I can, but tbh I'm just 100% quarantined being just an student at the moment."

"Didn't they play the ""if you don't like it, you're probably a terrorist"" card too? 
And wasn't the majority of the reaction to the bill negative?"
The Anglepoise is a design classic. Designed by a automobile engineer who spent his life designing car suspensions.
They are actually very easy to press. Like as if the case didnt exist. I sometimes accidentally press the power all the time.
"Flip Flappers was on 2 lists, but it's still fairly recent.  Maybe it'll enter the top 100 in the future as newer lists are published."

"I really like atom for GUI work... depends where you're doing your development though I suppose. I usually set up some sort of sftp and use the ftp built into atom and work directly off the server from my computer.

As far as CLI, I'm a nano fan."

I enjoy it.
"Another vote for UltraEdit here. It's tremendously powerful and always gets the job done for me, though I don't use many of its more advanced features. I also don't think it has been maintained particularly well; it's a little rough around the edges, with more modern features like text antialiasing feeling poorly bolted-on. And it has suffered tremendously from feature creep (but I suppose the marketing department has to get their due).

Ultra-Edit really has two killer features for me:

1. Perl regular expression support! I could not use an editor without this. Though Ultra-Edit's implementation seems to choke on a few of the edge cases and more obscure Perl-introduced features (even though they've been standardized for years now...)

2. Shell extension: I can right-click any file and open it in Ultra-Edit with just one more click. This is absolutely awesome once you have it, and something I always miss on my Linux desktop."
"*vifm* is very fast and nice, however it has a lot of features that are only mentioned and not fully documented. So there's functionality there that you want to use, but don't know how."
"""The Week"" is a very good news-magazine with local, European, American, and global sections. It provides a cross-spectrum analysis of what the papers are saying, how it effects the common fowk, and what may happen in the future. It covers all the major stories, and has a detailed financial section. I recommend it to everyone.

I am not paid, have never been paid, and am not about to be paid by the Week for advertising their products."
Is it weird that I still like the lucky perfume (you know the pink stuff from middle school)?
What does N/A mean?
"With games nowadays pushing the needle towards $100, this is an absolute bargain for everything crammed inside this box."
"I actually watched the series they did on making the perfect pizza, great stuff!"
And yours is a helluva username for a child care professional.
"Definitely the FlatOut games.  
  
Burnout Paradise is pretty good as well."
"Bose sound quality is a joke lol. Its so boring. Flat reference sounds is already boring but bose takes it next level, literally nothing pops lol. My picks are:

Sony XM4 - for best noise cancelling but boomy bassy sound

Sennheiser momentum - for fun sound but ok anc

b&w px7 - for best all-round, great sound and good anc. although sound quality dips a lot with anc on"
"""But baby, I just want to truly feel you, we don't need protection between us"""
looks interesting. thanks!
"I enjoyed Orconomics, just never felt the need to pick up the sequel, might be worth a revisit.

and man, Glenn Cook is one of my favourite authors. (talking about Raymond Swanland Art, I love my omnibus editions of the black company and dread empire chronicles)"
"I respectfully disagree - geologists subject themselves to far more puns than non-geologists could ever dream up.  Most people don't know about gneiss and schist, but geologists abuse them endlessly.  Of course, I'm totally complicit in this."
