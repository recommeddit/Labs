67453,axios alternatives reddit,"> Not sure what if it can do it now. It wasn't been able to do it in clean way earlier like 8 months ago. And obvious option was Axios. If had to do something new ground up, I would maybe check it. However, I'm doubtful it's on par, though.

Exactly, Axios is just an API wrapper around XmlHTTPRequest. 

I wrote the article to demonstrate the many use-cases which used to have me reaching for Axios."

29058,best calendar tool,"I use Google Calendar for all of mine. I think the manually moving things around if your schedule/plans change is something you'd have to do in any app. And for my money, Google Calendar fits the bill. 

a) free

b) easily accessible on multitude of devices anywhere with internet

c) color-coding

d) shareable

e) view multiple calendars at once

f) instant syncs

There are probably more, but that's what I could think of quickly.

I have a main ""work"" calendar, that's where I put in who I'm booked with - I share this with my wife so she knows where I am on whatever day.

Then I have individual calendars for each client that I work with - so clientA gets their own calendar. clientB and so on - these are just for me to track what I've done or what I plan to do.

On the client calendars I put an entry in for ""projectX - rough cut"" and then estimate out how long that might take. I reassess it each day or as things move/change and adjust as necessary. It doesn't really take that long to do. 

But, you might also want to consider a project management system (something like Trello) where you can create a board with ""cards"" and tasks and then move the tasks from ""To Be Done"", ""Doing"" and ""Done"". It may be more useful to you if you're more interested in tracking the movement/completion of each task vs tracking the time devoted to each task.  


Full disclosure, I have tried incorporating Trello into my work, but I just can't keep on top of it the way I should when the project starts going."

47989,best color to paint with,"Or you can go flat out. I've got long narrow room in my house, with a good sized window in the western wall and the door on the north wall east end.  I went with a deep rose on three walls and the whitest white I could stand on the east wall. Summer sunsets bounce off the white and glow into the hall. I usually watch the sun set in my west facing back yard. Sometimes I watch it in my hallway. It's never just about the colour of paint. It's about how that colour responds to the light that comes into the room, and the light you make in the room."

33780,best electric car,"Thus far, I am not a fan. 

It is not that I hate EV's because they are EV's, it is just because all of the EV's thus far are a big disappointment. 

&#x200B;

Currently, Tesla easily makes the best EV's, and they too are disappointing. The interiors are the biggest miss for me,  both in design and in quality; in the end I feel like you pay luxury car prices and receive a high end Nissan interior at best.

The range and charging limitations, though getting better, are still a big issue for those of us that don't live on the east coast. 

&#x200B;

The performance is getting there, but they are all one trick ponies: They accelerate really well to 60mph, they all still have overheating issues (though the new 3 is better than the S), I don't like the numb steering, or the brakes, and you can absolutely feel the enormous weight of the battery. 

&#x200B;

Right now, I just can't justify the price premium you pay for an EV, so until the range goes up, there are more charging locations, the charging time comes down, and an EV is the same price as equally equipped ICE car, I will not buy an EV."
