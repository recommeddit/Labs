55574,"JK Rowling was *nobody* before her first book took off, and the only reason it took off is because *people (of all ages) loved reading it*. That's about as far away from the concept of ""famous for being famous"" as you can get.

Of course, everything that's popular will attract additional attention because of its popularity. That's what popularity *is*.",best action and adventure novel series

47647,"Wisconsin:
The Dells (near Wisconsin Dells) are amazing. Not the tourist trap stuff, but the actual terrain. 
The north woods are beautiful and the south coast of Superior. 
And a drive through the fox valley is pleasant. 
As for actual places, Lambeau Field is a must for a sports fan. Hit a local brewery or brew pub. There's a million of them and I've yet to have a bad local beer. Try a local cheese too, like curds warm from the vat.",best state to visit in the United States

615,"How much do you get paid to do this shit, man? Perfectly normal account up until a few months ago. Then suddenly your whole account does *nothing* but recommend that shitty VPN and link to shady promo websites. You comment on a month old thread (the thread itself has 9 upvotes) and yet within 3 days your astroturf bullshit has double that many. And that's always the story. Someone asks for a VPN rec, and every stupid comment linking to some borderline malware site recommending Nord is always highly upvoted, and their whole recent account history is just doing that same thing over and over and over. Are these just stupid bots on stolen accounts? It's so god damn annoying.",best vpn for torrenting reddit

4157,"I suggest CLion.  It's commercial software, but I think you can get it for free if you're a student.  It's cross-platform, flexible, has a growing plugin ecosystem, and its code analysis and refactoring features are second-to-none. Using it as an IDE will require some familiarity with the CMake build system, since its project awareness is built on top of it, but that's good to know anyway, and for simple projects it's trivial to set up.   My only real knock on it is that the built-in debugging is just adequate.

IMHO coding in ""dumb"" text editors is for preening hipsters and old dudes whose preferences calcified decades ago, not programmers looking for the best ways to get work done quickly and well in 2019.   Powerful tools make coding much more pleasant.",best text editor
