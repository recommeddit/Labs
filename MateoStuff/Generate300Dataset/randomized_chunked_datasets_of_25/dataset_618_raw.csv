It's heavily overrated. A good bit of the reason people still talk about it is cause every rapper and their dog cite it as an influence
Well now I'm judging you right back.
Shake it Off is my feel good song if I want to dance around in the gym
"The Atlantic coast is divided up among 14 different states; the Pacific coast consists of 3 states. So any state by state short list of highlights is going to miss a lot out west.

How to describe California?

There's [Venice Beach](https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_section/public/media/activities/venice-beach-king-solomon.jpg?itok=sinrd-7w) - a sort of permanent carnival

or [San Diego Harbor](https://i2.wp.com/www.sandiegocatcruises.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/san-diego-harbor.jpg) with its maritime museum.

or [Big Sur](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/7c/ee/53/big-sur.jpg) for pure natural beauty

or maybe you just can't resist the [Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.heise.de/imagine/jbiusiXD2YhZj1bN3daLb4R7O3Q/gallery/Golden-Gate-Bridge-San-Francisco.jpg)

Back east these would all be in different states, the way the states divide up there.

A few of my favorites:

Or just come for Disneyland."

"I can't describe Gingham, either, except that it makes my eyes cross in euphoria. Only one other perfume ever did that to me, but it's so weak and it's long been discontinued."
I love Nike but I will never be able to run in them because of my wide feet. Sure I will wear my Flyknit Trainers as casual shoes but could never run in them. I will also stick with my Asics.
I love marriott. I have a huge travel perk with them though by getting rooms at employee prices. Spent a week in Hawaii in a two bedroom suite for $104 a night instead of 349. Started churning to take advantage of it more often. I agree that marriotts are always clean and comfortable. Never had a bad experience with them.
Jerry Springer films in Stamford; that's about the most American experience you can get.

"My go-to is usually just hard apple cider. I don't have actual drinks often, last couple ones I had were some energy drink +  cranberry juice + vodka mixes and I didn't get any sleep after all that caffeine lol. Malibu rum + cola is probably my favourite drink I've had so far in my life, it's so sweet and yummy."
"I'm also horribly allergic to most earrings but my bf got me those silicone thingies that are like sleeves for the earring, called flutees. They prevent the metal from touching the skin and I can wear my jewelry again!"
Metropolus has the best sandwiches in town. Country Meat Market is the best sandwich in Goleta.
"I have met [Kid Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock) a few times. Super down to earth and a really cool guy.

Ive met a couple other celebrities in my time doing theater management but Kid Rock was the coolest."
And TSA will cut the wrap. Had happened to me the past 3 times going from US to Brazil.
Ours are alone most of the day. A quick walk around the block and they are happy to sleep on the couch all day.
"john elway. but again, i'm clearly biased."
Appsflyer just put out a performance report of all the networks that is worth looking at - http://hub.appsflyer.com/appsflyer-performance-index-2016-h1
"He is, he's busy with school"
"I write down most of my trips so I can remember them and visit them later. 

Here is my [LSD](http://individuationing.com/2015/01/17/i-finally-found-lsd/) experience, [DMT](http://individuationing.com/2012/10/21/dmt/) experience, and my recent [mushroom](http://individuationing.com/2015/04/27/81/)."
"Linux Mint, Ubuntu, elementary OS – there isn't much difference between them, all of them are Ubuntu-based. Use any desktop environment that looks good to you."
"+1 for a detachable showerhead. I don't enjoy masturbating that way, but I do like being able to clean with a directed stream of water on my private bits because leftover soap gets itchy down there. Squeaky-clean b-hole: A+"
"The Body Shop British Rose - I only have the body cream but I wouldn't mind getting the fragrance spray, it's really nice. I also want to try BBW Rose.

White Shoulders is pretty cheap and a total classic, very clean and floral.

CK One can be found incredibly cheap through discounters, I wore it in high school (yes the 90s) and I've been thinking about picking up a small bottle again for old times' sake."
I always put my phone down on its face when it’s got a case on
"Such a disappointing movie. So much potential wasted. Still worth watching, but with the talent in it, it could have been so much more."
