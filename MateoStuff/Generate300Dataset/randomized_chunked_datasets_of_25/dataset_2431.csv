15975,best sunglasses for fashion,"if you want to make the MiUSA argument you need to specify-  from a company based in the US which also makes all of their products in the USA.

15981,best sunglasses for fashion,"But this doesn't make sense if the goods you are purchasing aren't made in the US, they could be the same chinese products but simply at a higher price (which is often what happens with many smaller US based companies that simply import their products).

>This seems like youre implying a chinese company.

I should clarify: I'm implying that anyone who says expensive name brand sunglasses are worth it simply hasn't bought good stuff *more directly* from China through aliexpress or similar website.

If I setup a US based company reselling things on aliexpress- which would you prefer to pay: my inflated price just because I'm based in the US? or the cheaper price on aliexpress?"

67056,best places to skydive in california,"Definitely do Skydive Hollister.


I did my first jump with them and they were amazing. The coaches have tons of experience and are more than willing to answer any questions on the ground and in the air.

I will say it was a while ago but I remember it being pretty reasonable compared to the other skydiving places in the area.

Also photos are so expensive because it requires a second jumper to take the photos"
