"Ok, that's really funny."
"Damn, that sucks."
"I love scifi books, but I just couldn't get through the Neuromancer. I hate starting books and not finishing them, but the Neuromancer is so hard to understand.

"Firefox is literally the fastest and most efficient since the last update. It's also open source and (kinda) privacy-centered. With the right plug-ins and search engines, Google, Amazon, Facebook and other tech giants will never be able to track you and know everything about what you do online.

"There are a lot of things at play here that are really quite well executed for someone as young as you were. I watched that all the way through and even felt like I connected with it on an intellectual level, which is more than I can say about anything I've ever seen by an 11-or-12-year-old, ever.
