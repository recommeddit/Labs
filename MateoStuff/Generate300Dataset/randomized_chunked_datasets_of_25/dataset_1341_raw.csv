"Anyone that teaches a trade. 

I knew a guy who wanted to major in Ancient Linguistics. C'mon now. Or Philosophy. How many philosophy jobs are there?"
This one got to me the most
"A [Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker](https://www.hamiltonbeach.com/breakfast-sandwich-maker-25475) 

Insert English muffin, egg. cheese, Canadian bacon, and extras to taste (I like yum-yum sauce on mine). They also make a [dual version](https://www.hamiltonbeach.com/dual-breakfast-sandwich-maker-25490)."

"The best thing about them is they have something for everyone. If you want to watch shit movies get ripped apart, they have that (Best of the Worst). If you want to watch in-depth reviews of some of your favourites, they have that (re;View). If you just want contemporary reviews to find out if a movie is worth spending your money on, they have that too (Half in the Bag).

And... if you want to watch a 116 year-old serial killer with an addiction to pizza rolls bitch about Star Wars, you have that too (Mr. Plinkett)."
The one surprising fact is that Azharuddin's India had a better LOI win-loss ratio than Ganguly's India.
"Couple drops per liter.  I'd shake it up for a bit, lit it sit a few minutes then open it up.  If you smell faint chlorine smell then you are good to go, if you don't it is likely that you haven't fully inactivated everything in the water, so repeat the process. 

The smell of the chlorine is a good sign because it means everything that can be inactivated, is likely inactivated. I will say that this isn't full proof either.  Certain spores and viruses are resistant to chlorination, but I feel this is a good enough precaution in emergency situations."
"This is the right choice for exactly one reason -- it's the only Chromium-based browser that properly implements ""tabs at the end"".  There are Chrome extensions, but they get it wrong when undoing closed tabs (ctrl+shift+t), thinking that's a new tab and moving it to the end instead of opening where it was closed.  Firefox does ""tabs at the end"" correctly, too, but I prefer Chromium's rendering and extensions."
"Oh yeah, androids are cool for that. I had another phone that was 21:9 (Sony Xperia 1) really slick phone :P"
Honestly it’s blaze for me. $10 will get me enough toppings to make the pizza last two meals and it’s delicious imo
I voted for Jumbo
"Zilent v2 @ 67g, really love the way the feel with the amount of force and tactility while being quiet enough for the office. Only downside for me was price and time lubing, but I didn't join r/mk to be rational with a keeb."
This is why Tommy Boy is my daily.
Black prismacolor on news print is great for practice. Use a better archival paper for refined work.
You'd be surprised how many toothpastes aren't approved!
Wtf!?
"my husband uses matterhorn from old spice, both the deodorant and the body wash. its my favorite."
"How was The Last Remnant?  It has some pretty iffy reviews, but it's constantly on sale on steam."
"I just want to add, to reduce the amount of people getting sick:

Cough and sneeze into your elbow, NOT YOUR HANDS.

DO NOT go to work if you are sick, *especially* if you work with the public."
"Hey! First thanks for the review!

I'm looking to upgrade to an artisan soon. I've mostly used the CorsairMM300 for 2 years and the g640 for a  it over a year. I like the control of both but I definitely want a bit more speed while keeping some control since I play some tracking oriented games too (Val/Apex)

Would be using it with my viper mini (tiger ace 1 feet and paracorded with a bungee)

Would the zero or hien fit the bill? In soft or mid?"

I think the RX 580 and the GTX 1060 6GB perform similar but you can find the RX580 a bit cheaper. But the GTX 1060 is more power efficent while the the RX580 (and all the other AMD GPUs) have Freesync. Freesync monitors are way cheaper than G-Sync monitors which is the Nvidia equivalent of AMDs Freesync.
"Either Ubuntu or Fedora. Fedora has the best package manager, Ubuntu has the best games support and larger community base."
