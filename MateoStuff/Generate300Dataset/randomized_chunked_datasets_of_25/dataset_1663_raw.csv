">Reddit's community is getting fragmented across multiple subreddits with overlapping content.

I don't see that as a problem. The goal of the subreddit system was precisely to allow multiple communities with conflicting interests (people who love pun threads in every link vs. people who like in-depth discussion, for example) to live together."

Pizza Guru has some amazing atypical pizzas (goat cheese w/ pesto and buffalo chicken) and do gluten free. I'm more of a simple pizza person in general but the Peaceful Pesto there is amazing and figured they deserved a shout out.
I see thanks!

"60 / 144 / 240

The rest are marketing gimmics. Turn the OMG 165 or 170 or 300 HZ, buuuut silently everything else gets turned down. More ghosting, lower response time, lower contrast, etc.

As far as I managed to research, this applies to every single monitor out there.

Mine is a 170 hz monitor, but I will never turn that option on"
"I really wish Hannu Rajaniemi got the attention he deserves. That trilogy is amazing. So many interesting concepts, ideas, and settings."
"True. I also believe in them to a degree. Most of that is due to their leadership, major investments and partnerships with Ford and Amazon, prototypes testing, and to be honest I do value the fact they are taking reservations and have a very polished ""brand"" including their website amd marketing (although i know they also took reservations for the cyber truck and semi and those are about as real as unicorns)"
Amazon just did a sale on the C920 for €25 so I bought it. I was using a DSLR + Capture card and flipped backwards for the convenience. Even using Magic Latern the DSLR still auto timed off the live video every 30 minutes. Webcam is plug and play and honestly once you tweak the settings it's not a whole lot different.
"I’ve recently switched from axios to fetch in a react project due to proxying request issues. 

Fetch is great just took some reading to understand the error handling process, like how to handle server errors, etc."

"I hadn't come across either of them because I'm not terribly well connected to the scene, largely relying on seeing something reviewed in the guardian; recommended by amazon or someone else commenting about it. 

So my question is ""where are you finding all this buzz about books?"". One of the issues I find with GoodReads when looking for recommendations is filtering out all the YA and YA pretending not to be YA

I've bought both because they do look good."
"I've tried many shoes in my local running store, from most of the major brands and every time I go, the Nike vomero always end up on top in terms of support for my foot. They may be not the most durable shoe, but I did 1100km on my vomero 8's (even ran a marathon on them) and they held up well!"

"Switch definitely is the best in terms of family-friendly exclusives, plus it can be a handheld as well"

"Looks ok so far. I'd take off a few PS3 games. Don't really need Heavy Rain, LBP1, Resistance 1&2, and you really don't need the Silent Hill Collection or Army of Two."

I agree with you
"Better than Final Fantasy 10 and Devil May Cry!

It’s even higher than Angry Birds, which surely must be a bigger breakthrough in mobile gaming"
