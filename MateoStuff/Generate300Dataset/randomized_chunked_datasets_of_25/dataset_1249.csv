32593,"My wife and I got married at Rayavadee in Krabi, Thailand earlier this year. If there's a more amazing place with a better setting and service etc. then I'm yet to see it.

It's a peninsula between 3 beaches, one of which, Railay Beach is the best I've ever been to. Inaccessible by car so you have to get a longboat (or speedboat) from the main part of Krabi. They filmed a James Bond film on an island just off the coast and The Beach was also filmed on another island in the area.

I honestly cannot imagine that anyone could find a better place for a honeymoon, it's that amazing.",best vacation resort

Get me something I will USE. It doesn't have to be expensive. I have in my pocket a Winchester pocket knife that has ""Dad"" etched on the blade it cost maybe ten bucks. But damn if I don't think aboht how it got to be in my possession every time I pick it up.

62511,"Now this is just my opinion. I was fairly excited to play it when I got it about 2 months ago. Played all the ACs up until unity, and none after. I heard they were like RPGs now and what not. 

Turns out Odyssey was just an unnecessarily large world with some of the worst copy/paste content I've ever seen. Great graphics and combat, but that's about it. Missions are just as bad, story is just as bad, now there's a tiered loot system, mtxs, on and on. 

Again, the world looks beautiful and the combat is nice. But good lord is that game way too repetitive. I'm about 60 hours in and I've given up.",Best RPG game on PS4
