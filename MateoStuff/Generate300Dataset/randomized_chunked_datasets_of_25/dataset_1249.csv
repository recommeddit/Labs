14478,best romantic novel,"Radiance by Grace Draven, Any book by Amy Harmon"
42805,best detective show,"CSI, they are all pretty good and the long background story is pretty cool too.

It has a wide range of characters and their development thought-out the series is pretty unique. Gibbs, fucking Gibbs. He's just, well, it's Gibbs."
2589,best headphones,"If I may ask, where did you get your pair in nz?"
32593,best vacation resort,"My wife and I got married at Rayavadee in Krabi, Thailand earlier this year. If there's a more amazing place with a better setting and service etc. then I'm yet to see it.

It's a peninsula between 3 beaches, one of which, Railay Beach is the best I've ever been to. Inaccessible by car so you have to get a longboat (or speedboat) from the main part of Krabi. They filmed a James Bond film on an island just off the coast and The Beach was also filmed on another island in the area.

I honestly cannot imagine that anyone could find a better place for a honeymoon, it's that amazing."
42384,movies like Inception,"Zero is not a necessarily a downvote because of the vote fuzzing reddit does.

Next time, get some patience and wait until a comment is at -5 before saying anything about downvotes :/"
55242,best places to hike in the east coast,"Haha, yup! Those horrific logistical problems seem to be an east coast thing (maybe just the northeast) specifically. It's kind of sad."
366,best terminal file manager reddit,Dired.
45870,best trick or treating candy,Anything chocolate.
11328,best gifts for dad,"This is just my view on gifts in general:

Get me something I will USE. It doesn't have to be expensive. I have in my pocket a Winchester pocket knife that has ""Dad"" etched on the blade it cost maybe ten bucks. But damn if I don't think aboht how it got to be in my possession every time I pick it up.

Get an item for a hobby, or for work. You know him better than us."
52835,best hiphop album,You talking bout my ghetto son?
71722,best movies with a cool twist,Incendies is one of the best I’ve seen.
62000,Best RPG game on PS4,"The first one has that issue, yeah. My advice would be to just find a non-spoiler guide for the main questline. The combat in 2 and 3 is much more polished and overall tighter and I loved it. But 1 does get annoying at times."
55330,best action and adventure novel series,It's the only one written by Dumas
22816,best celebrity,He always seems like a genuinely nice guy on his show. I'm glad to hear this.
62511,Best RPG game on PS4,"Now this is just my opinion. I was fairly excited to play it when I got it about 2 months ago. Played all the ACs up until unity, and none after. I heard they were like RPGs now and what not. 

Turns out Odyssey was just an unnecessarily large world with some of the worst copy/paste content I've ever seen. Great graphics and combat, but that's about it. Missions are just as bad, story is just as bad, now there's a tiered loot system, mtxs, on and on. 

Again, the world looks beautiful and the combat is nice. But good lord is that game way too repetitive. I'm about 60 hours in and I've given up."
14727,best romantic novel,"Brokeback Mountain, Little Women, Time Traveller's Wife, Romeo and Juliet, I might think of more later..."

61618,Best RPG game on PS4,"Chrono Trigger
