8313,"Warning: not activated charcoal. Repeated use (more than once per month!) will actually erode your enamel.

Edit: Source: My own dentist, all the dentists in articles, and the British Dental Journal [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8) which in fact states there is zero whitening, they all lack fluoride, and it has risks from potential ingredients and complications.

It is NOT for daily use. Read the label. It is NOT safety approved for toothpaste.

Slight whitening may be seen due to abrading the enamel.

If you are going to test activated charcoal for your teeth, smear it. There is no point in brushing it.

The basic idea of Borda is for a ranked list, say 1-10. The highest ranked is given a score of 10 and the lowest is given a score of 1. You can then essentially combines scores across lists to find an aggregation. There’s a little bit more to it in this case, but that’s the gist of the idea. I tried a method called CEMC that yielded slightly better results, but when the list got this large it became computationally impossible.",best board games
