8945,best toothpaste,I was told (by a water treatment plant worker who adds fluoride) that adults do not benefit from fluoride and it is useless to them.  But that children most definitely do.  Any truth to that?
8313,best toothpaste,"Warning: not activated charcoal. Repeated use (more than once per month!) will actually erode your enamel.

Edit: Source: My own dentist, all the dentists in articles, and the British Dental Journal [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8) which in fact states there is zero whitening, they all lack fluoride, and it has risks from potential ingredients and complications.

It is NOT for daily use. Read the label. It is NOT safety approved for toothpaste.

Slight whitening may be seen due to abrading the enamel.

If you are going to test activated charcoal for your teeth, smear it. There is no point in brushing it.

54631,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Zero soft is obviously much better quality, a lot more durable and has nice premium feel. It is also considerably faster with less stopping power. I prefer xsoft zero because it is a bit slower. But still faster than G640."

27066,best board games,"I mean, in some ways this is also likely to be skewed, albeit potentially in different ways. I cover methodology lightly at the end https://boardgamesquad.com/top-games-meta-list/#Notes_about_Data_Methodology_and_Changes_from_the_Previous_List

The basic idea of Borda is for a ranked list, say 1-10. The highest ranked is given a score of 10 and the lowest is given a score of 1. You can then essentially combines scores across lists to find an aggregation. There’s a little bit more to it in this case, but that’s the gist of the idea. I tried a method called CEMC that yielded slightly better results, but when the list got this large it became computationally impossible."

61358,Best RPG game on PS4,"Final Fantasy IX is arguably the best one, you can't miss it 

DARK SOULS 1 and 3 --- just do it. It's difficulty is overhyped, its tough but fair and you DO adapt. There is a reason these games are so highly regarded, there is nothing quite like it

Dragon Age is absolutely brilliant, one of the best games you can play 

To that end, so is Mass Effect trilogy ( play all three, don't skip any) 

Horizon Zero Dawn is impressive more than you'd expect"
