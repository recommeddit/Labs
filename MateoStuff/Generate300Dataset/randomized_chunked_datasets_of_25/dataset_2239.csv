64804,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"For Mexican food you've got plenty but it all depends what you want to eat. So you got Los Agaves, Santo Mezcal, Los Arroyos etc. If you want cheap eats you got Cucas on micheltorena, Litos take out, Cuernavaca, lilly's tacos. I've eaten  in almost every restaurant in SB (usually family owned restaurants).  But I usually dine in old town now. Red Pepper here i come! 

If any questions dm me !"
67756,axios alternatives reddit,"I've just spent my day tinkering with it so the documentation is still fresh in my mind. Documentation which list all options but doesn't explain each and every one in a paragraph, I had to look at the source to be sure.

So the direction is quite clear : this is an easy library since the defaults are sensible, like the JSON-first approach, and the documentation mostly focus on methods on how to GET/POST/PUT and create instances. Just install, instanciate, and boom you can send requests !

But dig a bit and you find that you can easily change everything to fit your needs, albeit you need a bit of experience in reading documentation and parameters syntax to figure it out. To me this is the sign of a complete library compared to a mere polyfill.

As you said, it deserves a more detailed article to explain it, maybe I'll share my own journey when I'm done !"

64035,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"remind me in a few days.  This site goes free once in a blue moon so I'm downloading everything that they have uploaded since the last time lol.

But ya, DC++ is a file sharing program where there's things called HUBS and people meet in these hubs and share files with each other.  It just so happens that DC++ is the best place to get comics and audiobooks on the internet BY FAR.

The only issue is people I've tried to get to sign up for it say they can't get into the chat room to register.

If you want to get started asap on this, this is what I would do.  You want to download DC++ and look up the hub called ""perfection"".  Find the address and enter it into dc++ and go to that chat room.  First register for that comic hub.

After you have registered, message a guy named UKPete and ask him if you can register to dawghouse.mine.nu so you can start downloading audiobooks (assuming you can't get in normally which you might not be able to).

And be super nice to a guy named nestlesux as he has a huge stick up his ass and is the one who will register you.

You don't have to answer questions or anything it's easy to register.  There's like 5 or so comic book rooms you can go into and ask people there why you can't get into dawghouse.mine.nu to download audiobooks.

But ya, you should go to audiobookx right now and download, their entire catalog is free right now which rarely happens.

to download though open a page and right click and do inspect element.  Then go to the bottom of the page and click on network, then click media and other.  Then leave that page alone, go to the site and find whatever book you want.  Each book you want, paste it to the inspect element page.  

You'll then see a media file pop up at the bottom, right click that and hit open in another tab.  Then your book will start playing and you can just right click on the page and download it.

But ya, hit me up in a few days and I can help you further, I'm typing super fast right now so I can get back to downloading lol."

39361,best web browser,I have been using Vivaldi and it is the best i found.
23430,best car racing video game,I loved that soundtrack. Spent hundreds of hours playing that with my kids back in the day anf it had a major impact on my sons taste of music. Eventually got a projection set up and I used to just cruise around for hours. And I was constantly impressed at how they managed to make each car feel so different.

43691,best items under $100,My eno hammock.  Best purchase I’ve ever made over or under $100
11387,best gifts for dad,"Forgot to answer the OP's question, as I was too busy bitching about my life like a whiny little shit.

Don't buy him anything. Make him something. It sounds cliche, but do it. Dads are crazy proud of that stuff. I have a pen holder my son made for me (obviously with a lot of help as he was 4) and someone asked me what that retarded thing was for.

No joke, I broke his god damned nose. That pen holder is possibly the best present I've ever received from anyone. Completely useless, pink (my son's favorite color) and covered in glitter (he likes shiny things). But he made that shit for ME. It's MY fucking pen holder and nobody will talk shit on it without immediately coming to terms with how violent I can get.

So yeah, make him something or cook him something, but do it to the BEST of your ability. Not some cheesy shit. If you absolutely suck at wood working but know he likes wooden things, make him a small box that is sanded really well. Even if it's constructed like shit, and isn't straight, as long as you put your effort into it, he'll like it. It's a reflection of the effort he put into you.

Tl;Dr I LOVE my fucking pen holder."
10362,best suitcase lock,"I travel a lot for work. Listen to this guy. Not only does shit get stolen but bags get lost. Throw an extra pair of clothes and anything of relative value in your carry-on. Think to yourself: ""If this bag were to disappear and never be seen again, is there anything I would be really upset about losing?""

Also keep in mind that many airlines nowadays will make you check your rolling bag at the gate if there isn't enough room in the overhead storage. So never put anything valuable in there, even if you plan to carry it on."

47254,best state to visit in the United States,"Heh. I'd heard it before my first trip to New Orleans, but my very tipsy friend had not, and took the bet, while the guy side-eyed me with a half-grin.

Before he won, he said, ""First of all, I'll give you some advice: you never bet a man at his own game in his own town."""
