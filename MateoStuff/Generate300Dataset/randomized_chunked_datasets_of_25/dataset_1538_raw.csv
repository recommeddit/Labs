You're not supposed to use it when your hands are visibly dirty. I'm surprised you thought hand sanitizer is a scrub. That's probably why you thought this article was worth posting.
"I started reading Roger Ebert's review of Fight Club the day I went to see it in theatre. I noticed that Edward Norton's character was simply called ""Narrator"", which struck me as weird (English Lit major), and thus during the film I kept trying to figure out what his actual name was. I figured out the twist, but only a few moments before it was revealed."

"I have spent a lot of time with Mel Gibson.  Despite the reputation, he is the most gracious host ever.  Been to his house informally for lunch twice, and HE made the sandwiches...kept asking if everything was OK..got up to get drinks...cleared the table and did the dishes (not that there were a lot)

He just acted like WE were the celebrities.  Crazy.  And was always just very thoughtful.  Hated the superficiality of Hollywood...said he'd never go for that plastic surgery stuff...and would just age normally..etc.

I know the stories, but from my personal experiences, he is a complete gentleman"
Ricardo Pereira and Cancelo ahead of Semedo is not bad. We just unlucky last euros with Ricardo Pereira injured and Cancelo getting covid.
"In the UK - if you can afford not to, don't do law. Many law firms I stumbled across prefer non-law rigorous degrees (linguistics, maths, hard science) and a conversion to law. If you get good enough grades, you might be able to get your degrees for free because some firm or Inn of Court will pay for it. If you want to do IP law, just do science. Whatever area of science you graduate from is the area that you can do patents. Also, you can work in the patents office. If you don't want to do law, you will always get asked the question as to why you studied law and you are not trying to work in law (as I got when trying to get a job in PR).

Finally, if you want to be a solicitor forget the LPC. A new 'super exam' is coming out in 2020 and you won't need to spend £10-20k on the LPC to qualify. You will, however, still need 2 years' work experience so get that now."
"I've heard some of their stuff; pretty good from what I've heard thus far. They're on my very very long list of ""stuff I need to listen more of some day."""
"You can tell they were going for a much more modern list of greatest albums, when compared to Rolling Stone's list.  RS seems to believe the best music was made in the 60s, never to be topped.  However, NME has a definite british bias (except that Sgt Pepper's is only 87), and biased towards 80s music.  Which is probably due to their respective reader's ages."
"Hey good point. Great motivation to dive into the culture on vacation. ""Buy local"" while you're there."
"In retrospect, the wire gauge or better, the voltage drop as you say, would be excellent to know. And the weight would change based on wire gauge. But modern and higher-speed rated cables are so short today that you might be hard-pressed to see a gram of difference."

"Nice! The Xbox 360 was a big part of my life for years. Can fully recommend the Fable games.

Since it's an older console, probably bought secondhand, it might be a good idea to open it up and remove the dust, making it run smoother. Have fun!"

Very energetic. They are very intelligent and easily trained but require a lot of attention or they use their intelligence for evil. And they do enormous craps. Your back yard will quickly become a mine field that requires daily  cleanups.

"Almost nobody in any profession ends up in the textbooks, it's irrelevant. 

My point is that REGARDLESS of your specialty, your ambition and dedication is what guides the ""usefulness"" of your education and your success in it, not the knowledge itself."
