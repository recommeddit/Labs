awwws what a cute post.
"From what I've seen most lists like this skew heavy. Seems the venn diagram of ""invested enough to make a top 100"" and ""likes uno"" is two circles."
TMZ is shit. No one cares about what they have to say about anything.
"Thank you so much for this post. I'm going to use what I've read to get myself to change many bad habits I have. Mainly using drugs to relieve stress, which leads to sleep deprivation, then falling behind at work/ignoring my hobbies, and using drugs to try to make me feel better. Been getting progressively worse for 3+ years now, if I don't change soon I don't know what I'll do."
"This is a very tight list as even the lowest one I rate way higher than any other pad I've ever used...

Otsu v2, hien, shidenkai, Raiden, zero.

Zero on bottom because for control it's the best, but otsu v2 is just about as good, but is more comfortable with better speed. Shidenkai at 3 because although there are durability issues, I don't have them yet and it's the most fun pad of the bunch when I really want to fly!"
Mulholland Drive and other films by David Lynch.
"Ohhhh man! Surprised you haven’t heard of re:zero. It’s an Isekai (genre where main character gets transported to another world). He meets this lady then dies, getting reset to a certain point in time. This happens again and again till he realizes and it’s his sick journey. Rlly awesome thriller but it might be high because I watched it with little exp. I don’t doubt that you’ll enjoy it. Give it a shot!"
It's also funny that there are a total 8 authors who wrote this article.
There are two kinds of pain: useless pain and pain that makes you strong. I have no patience for useless things.
You can buy Tempo on Amazon.
A lot of regular colleges offer online programs. If you find the right school you might even be able to do the first year online and then change to on-campus without changing schools.
"As a piano player . . . Learn both guitar and piano.  

Piano will give you a wider musical selection to learn from and easier visual cues to understanding the relationships between notes/chords/progressions, etc.  

Guitar requires you to actually understand musical relationships because there are less visual cues.  At least for me, anyway.

Ultimately, pick up an instrument and hammer away.  Really try to understand what's happening in the music and absorb it.  If you give yourself to it, you'll walk away with value regardless of what instrument you choose."
Reminds me: I should make a sound clip of just that end stanza and set it on repeat. For the entire workout.
Terrible Writing Advice is great.
Wth are you rambling on about?
"I go to the nearby Ace for most things. There is a Sutherlands around he corner from that if they don’t have what I need.  For carpentry/building/ larger projects, we have a Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menards all within a mile of each other. So whichever one’s website says they have what I need for the price. 

Harbor Freight for many tools and odd hardware. 

Oh and the local farm supply for some things.

Wow, I go to a lot of different places. Mostly Ace."
"My mom met Richard Simmons in an elevator. My twin brother and I were babies, and my older brother was 2 or 3? He picked my brother up and I think did some goochey goo shit to my twin brother and me."
"*That's* why I wanted to watch Upstream Color! I've had it on my to watch list since it came out, but I couldn't remember why I wanted to see it so badly."

"I'm pretty sure if Nelly wasn't a celebrity, everybody would be convinced the guy was nuts - a St. Lunatic, if you will."
"Yea this is the answer. Diving deeper we find that it is the ISP's limiting bandwidth due to lack of competition and regulation.

I think TheVerge regularly covers this topic on their podcasts. They also mention how rural communities in Korea, Japan, and some parts of China have good broadband. In some cases their rural broadband are as fast as US Cities 5G broadband speeds.

I don't know the exact reasons why the ISPs aren't building out faster networks and lifting bandwidth restrictions, but I can probably guess that it is due to money. 

So in that way we won't be improving webcam quality. Same thing with video surveillance. Its all 1080P or 720P due to file sizes."
">I'm likely getting an f150 lightning. However, I'm probably opting for the 40k pro model.


>I expect to be first in line for the f150.

Why do you think you'll be first in line if you ordered a Pro model?  I was under the impression that the high-margin trims will be prioritized unless it's a fleet order.

I also put in my reservation for a Pro, I just don't expect it to be available until Q3 of 2022.

As an aside, I'd still rather have the single-motor Cybertruck for the same $40k, but there's virtually no chance it will be available to me before the F150L."
"Hey, just a slight heads up on your Asics review. The gt 2000 still has the fluid ride midsole. The difference between that and the 3000 is the length of the dynamic duo max support. The 2000 is just really where the arch is, however the 3000 carries on down to near where the big toe is, designed for the very late pronator!"
"Thanks to your table, I was able to discover Visible... and it's awesome... YOU'RE AWESOME."
There are whole house filters for that kind of stuff.
