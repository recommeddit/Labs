27262,best stocks to buy,"TRUST ME, BRO."
57219,best water brand,"Correct.  However, I've seen multiple reports of it being found in many municipal tap water samples as well."
17475,best iOS game,Is PaD worth getting into in 2021? I dabbled with the game very briefly about 2 years ago and was nearly immediately given some ultra high tier dragon (probably as a cheap catch-up mechanic) that one shot every single encounter for 4 straight hours. I ended up stop playing because the entire experience was so trivialized.
12324,best gifts for mom,"> Lotion infused socks

I had no idea these were even a thing. My wife thanks you in advance!"
28044,best breakfast foods,Wife's pussy.
16952,best iOS game,What made you go dedicated on mobile?
16821,best pet for toddlers,There is no dog that meets these criteria. If you get a dog I fear that both your family and the dog will be unhappy because it doesn't sound like your family is willing to put the work of a dog in.
13225,best gifts for mom,That sounds amazing! I know what I want for Christmas. :)
5178,best home improvement store,Now that you mention it we do have quite a few lumber yards within a 10 mile radius of our house....
10099,best pencil for drawing,"I find that even after emptying it graphite that is stuck to the sides slowly leaks out into my pencil bag, making a big gray mess on everything.  Erasers work great when they are covered in a thin layer of graphite.  I just really wish they made a sharpener that didnt leak graphite. Then a graphite holder would be the perfect form of pencil for me."
30586,best Mexican war to study,"If those were the reasons the US went to war, you might have a case.

It's pretty widely accepted that the US entered WWI to secure it's economic position, rather than being somehow 'provoked' by the Germans or out of altruistic notions.

The US entered because they feared exclusion from post war European markets."

67483,axios alternatives reddit,you could just return axios instead of the promise. (and I would personally use async await.)
34219,best NFL player,No Lamar Jackson is laughable. PFF consistently underrates the added value and offensive efficiency running as a QB has and I'm really tired of it. You can't say you value analytics yet talk about how passing is so much more efficient that running without realizing that running as a QB improves the total offensive efficiency. It really annoys me how biased that analysis of running as a QB is for them.
5662,best programming language for web development,Good luck explaining that to the person hiring you.
17313,best iOS game,Me too. Also wondering whether you can change the controller mapping.
18816,best YouTube video,"Why would you even cringe over that? It's AWESOME!! It's like I had a chance to peer into your world for a short time. Also, the fact that you chose Claire De Lune. I mean, WOW! 

It brought back memories of myself being young and my boyfriend and I staying late after school in the choir room and him playing that for me. Young Love. Sigh.

Thanks for the memory and I thought it WAS GREAT!

EDIT: A word"
48372,best color to paint with,"Skip the brands sold as home depot and lowes. Use Benjamin Moore or Sherman Williams etc. Listen to the pro painters responding here. Experience is everything.

I loved my SF apartment color so much I asked the management which color it was and used it in my house when I moved out of state. Kelly Moore 14 Frost, which SW matched in eggshell. It's a great warm off-white. Amazing in my dark basement. Everything feels soft and the white semi gloss trim pops."
44500,best items under $100,I used to think expensive socks were the stupidest thing. To me the only acceptable option was to buy the 30 pack (for $2) from Walmart once every 3 years. A couple years ago I bought a nice pair of socks for a cold weather excursion we were going on. Changed my entire outlook on life. I don’t own a single pair of those white socks anymore. I bought a nice set of good work boot socks and I have never looked back. They last a long time and for the money the satisfaction is well worth it.
40513,best midrange GPU,"Oh I see, so that means for example that the 1660S/RX590 is entry level/low-range?, then RX5700/2060 mid and 5700XT/2070 high-range?"
33150,best energy drink,"There's a Canadian company called Guru that makes a pretty good one. They have shitty distribution though, so they're hard to find. I mainly drink Amp Blue now.

Moderation's the key with these - they can be a wild ride. I write quite a bit, and prefer writing at night. So a couple times a month I decide that staying up till 3 in the morning is a fantastic idea, and with my otherwise regular sleep schedule, an energy drink around 10-11 is a necessary step for this."
