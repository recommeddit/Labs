It's pretty widely accepted that the US entered WWI to secure it's economic position, rather than being somehow 'provoked' by the Germans or out of altruistic notions.

34219,No Lamar Jackson is laughable. PFF consistently underrates the added value and offensive efficiency running as a QB has and I'm really tired of it. You can't say you value analytics yet talk about how passing is so much more efficient that running without realizing that running as a QB improves the total offensive efficiency. It really annoys me how biased that analysis of running as a QB is for them.,best NFL player

A couple years ago I bought a nice pair of socks for a cold weather excursion we were going on. Changed my entire outlook on life. I don’t own a single pair of those white socks anymore. I bought a nice set of good work boot socks and I have never looked back. They last a long time and for the money the satisfaction is well worth it.,best items under $100
