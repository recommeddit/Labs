53423,"Correction, they don't use higher voltage, a cable is just a cable. They have crap controller chips and thin wires leading to what happened to you. The device that's connected to it chooses how much power is drawn. When the cable can't handle how much power is being drawn because the wires are too thin, the wires heat up and start melting things. For example: 2 amps through an Apple charging cable is fine, 2 amps through headphone sized wire would burn it to a crisp.",best usb c charging cable

22996,"Amy Lee of Evanescence was absolutely wonderful. Some friends and I waited after a concert for autographs, and prior to Amy emerging,  the bouncer-type-guy laid out in no uncertain terms that we weren't to try to touch her.

Well, one friend had had depression and Evanescence was one of the things that got her through her teen years. So she broke down in tears when Amy got to her in the autograph line, and Amy just went in and gave her this giant, comforting hug (hard to do since Amy is SO tiny). She was fabulous.",best celebrity

I've now started getting some decent weapons and skills and took down my first horde yesterday which felt awesome.

Older rides (Gold Rusher, Revolution, Ninja) seem to be built around the landscape. I guess over time SFMM decided to go more for thrill than aesthetics, which I'm perfectly fine with since the newer coasters are pretty amazing. (As rickety as Revolution is, I do appreciate it's designed around landscape).
