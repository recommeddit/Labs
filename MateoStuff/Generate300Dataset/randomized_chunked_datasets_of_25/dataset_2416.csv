43336,"**Before integrating Ad Mediation Networks, Read this.**

&#x200B;

I am an indie developer, I have an app in Play Store and App  Store, I have been living off of them from last 3 years. Recently, I  decided to use ad mediation on my Android app to increase ad revenue, so  I mentioned this to couple of my friends who works in app development  companies, one of those friends suggested me an ad mediation network,  which basically integrates their SDK as well as other ad networks SDKs  to your app (just like any ad mediation) and serve ads using their ad  units, not ours. But for admob, they use our app's ad units.

Anyway,  I integrated their SDKs, after that, I couldn't sign the app to publish  to store, it was showing 'GC overhead limit exceeded' or 'Out of  memory: Java heap space' error. None of the solutions from stackoverflow  worked, but I could be able to sign the app by disabling Progaurd. I  contacted this  company on their website chat service, they responded  promptly, asked few questions, later they asked me to send my app's  Gradle file and Proguard file, which i did, then they told me to do few  changes to Gradle & progaurd files, I obeyed. Still the error did  not go away, when I told this to them, they asked me to send my whole  project. I was very busy on that day because I wanted to update the app  on that day itself so I told them, I'll send it later. Then I updated  the app by sigining with proguard disabled.

In two days, our app  got over 100k impression but their ads are very intrusive and full  screen ads are unskippable , so I removed their SDK from the app and  updated the app only with Admob like it was before. After couple of  days, one of my ad units in Admob started showing more impressions than  usual, and impressions are increasing 20% each day but clicks were same  as before. So I suspected something unusual happening in my app, I  looked where my app getting more impressions, one day it was USA, next  day Hungary another day it was Brazil and so on. I disabled that  particular ad unit, then in next update, I replaced all the ad units  with new ones. Now ads are serving normally like it was.

I  looked up about the ad mediation company's social media profiles, they  are deleted. Also, I found out couple of their ex-employees shared how  this company cheating developers. My guess is, this Ad mediation company  knew my app's ADMob ad units, so they artificially (using bots?)  inflated ad impressions, when Google finds out ad impressions are fake  Google will ban apps/developer from ever using Admob.

This Ad  mediation company trying to ban me from AdMob using these tactics, so I  would go back to them again, at least I think that was this company's  intention. Also, they asked me for my app's source code, I don't know  what could they do with source code, considering they can't do anything  to my app's listing on Google play, but asking for source code is  unusual. So I think, this company try to scam me, at least that's what I  think though I do not have any proof to prove that, so I am not  mentioning that company's name.

I am just sharing this here so if  any one wants to try ad mediation, be careful and mostly stick to  reputed mediations like AdMob, MoPub etc",best ad service for mobile applications

33269,"How heavy a trailer?  If the Rav4 Hybrid meets your needs then there are a few options that will pull ~3500ish +/-.  I could regurgitate but summarized by just googling ev towing or something like:

https://automotivemap.com/electric-vehicle-towing-capacity-2021-2652872833.html?rebelltitem=11#rebelltitem11

If you will need 5000+ options shrink, only existing one is Model X I think.  Then soon the Lightning, Rivians, etc.

I'm in this self debate where I want to move to an EV but need to tow 5000+ occasionally.  Not sure if I just keep my current truck since it's getting older/higher mileage/low trade in value anyway and get a new daily, or wait for one of the newer 5000+ options but they could be a year or two out for even a first year model at this point,  let alone waiting for revisions.

I go back and forth all the time.  I  kinda wish my boat was a little lighter and could be handled by a Model Y which would make it a lot easier.",best electric car
