22355,best celebrity,"I met John Candy on a plane when I was a little kid while traveling with my family.  He was a *big* man. He had the whole row to himself in front of us with the armrest up between seats so he could be more comfortable.   The stewardesses were blocking anyone from coming up and bothering him, even though they themselves were not exactly leaving him alone what with  talking to him constantly and laughing at his enjoyable banter the whole trip.

At some point he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he looked at me, pretended to do a double-take like he was surprised and said , ""hey, you're the quietest kid ever, don't you talk?""  The way he said it was so friendly that I just smiled and giggled. Then he had a pleasant conversation with my parents, who had been DYING to talk to him the entire flight, but were too polite to bother him.

Not even 2 weeks later we heard he had passed."

33093,best energy drink,"Redline. The only energy drink you have to be 18 or older to purchase. It has a series of warning labels. Youre only supposed to drink half to bottle the first time you drink it to assess tolerance and it doubles as a work out supplement that burns fat when you train. 

It's the only thing that kicks you in the fucking face when you need it to."

69635,best major to study in college,"Just piggy-backing off this. B.S. in Psych, worked retail for 3 years, then went back for my masters in Fall 2015. I got an assistantship which paid for 75% of my tuition and gave me a $200 a week stipend. I worked in the disability services office 20 hours a week and taught a section of the ""Welcome to College"" class to freshmen. Now I work full time in a disability services office at a different school and I adjunct teach for fun. Literally my assistantship is why I'm employable and I'm not even in that much debt from a 2 year grad program!"
