71319,"Here's a (perhaps) interesting sort of last moment ""twist,"" from the movie **King Rat** --about a prisoner of war camp where a low-ranked, scheming soldier rises to power by being able to procure ""what's needed"" for the rest of the prisoners.

Throughout the film, this man has another highly ranked soldier as his ""arch enemy"" --a man who works feverishly throughout their imprisonment to bring the upstart down.  And always failing.

At the movie's end, when the POW camp is liberated and the soldiers are being trucked home to freedom the ""arch enemy"" is getting his final licks in, dressing down the ""King Rat"" who is now just a powerless underling again, and assuring the man that he was less than worthless.

That's when another soldier tells the arch enemy the truth/the twist:  That if it weren't for the King Rat giving him something to hate with all his heart, he wouldn't have found the strength to survive the horrors of the camp.",best movies with a cool twist
