4923,best home improvement store,Ace Hardware. I don't know anything and find the huge stores overwhelming. A smaller store with more personalized service and knowledgeable associates is exactly what I need when buying stuff for a project. Everything I've done in our house is the first time I've ever done it.
36639,best alcoholic drink,"I don't drink much anymore (in my 40s), but I like the current trend of alcoholic carbonated flavored water (like boozy la croix). My fall-back drink is a cuba libre (just rum and coke plus lime). I also like tom collins - kind of like a way less-sweet lemonade. Oh, and hot mulled cider is the best.

Edit: OMG, when I was about 21, I loooooved Midori Sours. Way too sweet for me now, but yeah, loved them."

32218,best hotel to live in,"I worked at a Ritz Carlton a few years back, its literally the same as anywhere else. The hotel staff is amazing at their job, but on their personal time they're just as fucked as everyone else. 

The kitchen staff had a few folks with drug issues and had to be sent home a couple times because of it. In my time there I saw 2 waiters get fired due to embezzlement. The turnover rate for management was very high because they didn't pay enough for the area. The staff parties were WILD to say the least.

We weren't allowed to greet celebrities by name since they wanted to be anonymous, so we would use their alias that day. Some were greeted by prostitutes or ""escorts"" who were always super nice to everyone. A regular would rent out a room for a day, once a month, and make 30-40k that day from clients. Celebrities, business guys, you name it. Crazy."

67498,axios alternatives reddit,"I pretty much only use it so I can have the same structure for http requests on the front end and back end when using node. If I used another language server side I'd probably just use fetch.

Axios is a fun word to say though, and I think people would start looking at me funny if I made any more Mean Girls references so maybe there's another reason to keep it around."
32981,best energy drink,Monster assault is my fave.
37853,best Marvel movie,Itâ€™s recency bias. Remember the praise Black Widow got on this subreddit when it came out? Eventually people will realize that there are some big flaws in this movie.
17985,best Kardashian,"Nah I get that part. Just the way she handles it I guess, I find it sneaky or something. Like if she truly wants to leave then leave. But she still wants to get paid and get all the perks but not put any effort. She's not a victim, but she likes to play one."

26635,best board games,"Well technically it's a kid's game but I've seen numerous adults have be a blast with it. Also there are a bunch of versions with different animals, themes, and difficulty."
2620,best headphones,"I think 300-400 gets pretty damn good open backs and 200-300 for closed backs. Many cans in their respective categories are at the pinnacle of diminishing returns in those price points. I feel like HD25s for 200usd or there abouts is pretty good for portable on ears too. Also lachlan, you should check out the audio technica a900x if you ever get a chance!"

15385,best tree for the garden,"Finally, something I can answer! From a Botanist's perspective, I'd say almost all trees have *something* unique and cool to offer, but if I was held at gunpoint and forced to pick a favourite, i'd have to say the *Iklypt Fisairn* better known as the Opal Lilly.

The opal lilly is one of the most interesting plants from both a technical perspective, as well as from a layman's view. It's an approximately 1.5m high ""flowing"" shrub and like its name suggests, each petal of the lilly resembles an opal, containing multiple, vibrant colours which can appear to shimmer given the right light conditions. This property led to their use in some of the most expensive dyes in older times, however this has fallen off recently with the invention of better synthetic replacements and other crops that are able to be cultivated and farmed more easily. The Opal Lilly was originally native to the island of Sri Lanka, however due to its trade, it can be found growing anywhere as far away as Egypt and the Middle east, which is where its other name, the ""Byzantine Lilly"", came from.

The most interesting thing about the Opal Lilly isn't it's flower however, it's its fruit. More specifically it's the method of self-nourishment that it uses to produce its fruit. The Opal Lilly is the only carnivorous plant in the world that also produces fruit edible by humans. It is not like a Venus Flytrap however, which is called an active Phyllagetige, the Opal lilly is a Passive Phyllagetige, meaning that it just sits and waits for the food to come to it. The reason for the flowers bright patterning is not dissimilar to the reason for roses bright colouration; namely that it is meant to attract as many insects as possible. Once attracted, the insects are enticed into the bulb well in the centre of the flower, where they are subsequently caught in a sticky, mucus-like resin. The insect is left to die and decompose inside the flower and it's nourishment is then absorbed through the stem recess (the part at the bottom of the bulb well connecting it to the stem). The plants produce fruit which allegedly taste of a mild citrus like a cross between a tangerine and a lime, which is consumable by humans. 

**Tl;dr** the Opal Lilly is the only carnivorous plant in the world that produces human-edible fruit. It might taste like a lime, but you're actually eating bugs.

EDIT: Funnily enough, my last comment was about botany too."
23151,best social networking site for CS,"The point of joining a bunch of social media platforms is to maximize your reach. If your end goal is to become famous in the industry, getting your blog posts linked on Hacker News and such, you can't afford to give up free marketing opportunities.

If you just want to get good jobs, you can definitely afford to skip all those other social media platforms. Lots of successful developers don't have a Facebook, or don't use it for any professional purposes."
65244,best phone service company,"It's wild looking at your unfiltered list with US Mobile's new plans. They really are becoming one of the best options out there. After your podcast with the CEO, I'm excited to hear what they have coming up this year. I got in on Mint's $90 6 months unlimited in January, so I'll be in the market once that's up."

33723,best electric car,"The moment an electric sportscar is made that doesn't weigh a crap ton, I'll buy one. That's very hard to do though, other than the original Tesla Roadster, and those are hard to find nowadays. If there was a way to make a manual electric car, that'd also be really neat, but it wouldn't really make much sense from a design standpoint to do so.

&#x200B;

They're objectively better daily drivers (provided infrastructure in your area allows for it) than ICE's are. I'm no Tesla shill, but I've driven the Model 3 and it is a genuinely good car. Comfy, spacious, techy, and a mountain of torque whenever you want it. I'd still rather own my WRX though. (For now, at least ;\])"
9052,best toothpaste,"it's not a constant thing, although I don't time myself most days, it's *probably* close to 2-3 mins, maybe more in the mornings because with each stroke I am cursing the gods and wishing I was still asleep

you know regular stuff"
