Once I hit RE, I could design my own log cabin and move out of the city."
"Same might be true for Argentina that somebody mentioned in another comment. Most research comes from CONICET, a state entity."
My favorite...never end up going to places fancy enough where I can order it though :(

Bracket locating, multi-highlighter, lots of cool stuff in it. In fact, I've never had an idea for PSPad *that wasn't already implemented*."
