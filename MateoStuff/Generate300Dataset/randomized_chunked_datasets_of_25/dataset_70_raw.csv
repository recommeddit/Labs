Am 21. Need halp.
Kanye West Black Skinhead always gets me pumped.
"Hello I don’t know if this forum is still communicating but I’m looking for a laptop to learn software development and general stuff as in movies, YouTube etc. no gaming. What do you suggest with a limit of $1000"
Rip :(
I think as long as you're not in a leotard its perfectly acceptable.
"It's nothing like the older Assassin's Creed games. You can climb anything, literally. There's a lot of different gear. It also takes place in ancient Greece, and the mythology is really cool, same with origins, but I like Greek mythology more."
"Stardew Valley. It has everything you want in a game. Great story, tons to do, can play offline, relaxing. Just a great game. Also massive update coming sometime that introduces a bunch more to do."
English. It is known that employers will hire someone if they either double majored or minored in English. They want to make sure that their employees can speak and write the correct way.

I just made this recommendation in a different topic, but it fits your ""question reality"" requirement perfectly. It's not as hilarious as the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4sZaoqLfBM) might suggest but Michael Rapaport is really good in it and it is definitely unique."
"Ok but there’s black flag which is open world has tons of sea doesn’t have places which are locked until you play for hundreds of hours and is higher quality. Also, I don’t know how you grind, but for me grinding only gets me small amounts of xp most of the time and I usually get stuff that is worse than my current equipment so I have to do five or ten missions for every main mission because they each jump at least to levels!"
"Thank you, I really appreciate it. It’s kinda fun tweaking settings to get your stream setup all perfectly."
Which bidet do you use? Looking at the Luxe Bidet Neo 120 on Amazon but heard it can be hard to install
"Yes, he does.  He's really fun to talk to actually!"
"I rock an ajax countertop filter and keep a glass flip top bottle in the fridge. Filters are replaceable, cheap and the unit is durable."
I can't believe this is my first time seeing Tsuro on this sub! Amazing digital port
"I think I’m the only one in the world who thinks Black Panther is not a great movie. 

It’s one of my least favorite with Captain Marvel. 
And of course The Incredible Hulk."
"Bro, just cuz it says FREE doesn’t mean it won’t cost you. That game is practically P2W if you’re not willing to grind like crazy."
"I bought them online without trying them on, but I had a good idea that they would look good on me through experience with other sunglasses. 

I picked them out while browsing a sunglasses thread on styleforums although I can't find the link now for the life of me."
If you know you are having problems with roots and most likely there are utilities in that area then don't plant a tree. You are just asking for problems.
"Go to Costco: Their Kirkland brand sunglasses sell for around $25 not a large selection, but they're fashionable-ish and seem of good quality. They had wayfarer style, aviator style, etc all for around the same price.

Also in the opitcal section they have a larger selection (More name brand stuff like Police, Oakley, Persol, REVO, Serengeti, etc, etc...).  - again very reasonably priced. I bought some Hobies for around $40 and i'm very happy with them. Polarized, etc."
"and GM is so stuck in the 20th century, they'll probably have vestigial exhaust pipe cutout in the back."
Chaotic good
Imagine a bowler's plight who has to bowl to Ponting and Smith.
"3D Energy has been amazing. Smooth light carbonation, great flavor, and 200 mg of caffeine, as opposed to 300 from Bang. The red 3D is the best punch flavor in existence."
With any carrier it depends on where you live.
