27300,"1) VTI/VOO/SPY -index funds are always the safest and best long term play due the average investor, board market find are the best out of these.

2) tech: AAPL -huge moat, AAPL also has a nice stock split history and looks to become a strong dividend growth stock

3) consumer cyclical: KMB -also a huge moat, as well as providing necessary products (you can skip soda, or chips, but not toilet paper or diapers)

4) health: JNJ -moat like everything else, and doesn't depend heavily on parents (patents*, woops) which could expire in the next decade

5) energy: XOM -has a high level of planning/forsight, and seems to listen to shareholder meetings, meaning it'll likely keep up with changing energy trends.",best stocks to buy

69849,"I majored in International Studies, but close enough. 

Tips:

-study abroad as much as you can

-internships every summer

-learn a foreign language

-specialize in a region of the world (preferably Asia or the Middle East)

-ideally, match your specialization with your study abroad experience and language choice (ex - if you want to focus on the Middle East, study in the Middle East/North Africa and study Arabic)


Pros:

-flexible, more so than poli sci; you can get a lot of the poli sci jobs with International Relations but can also market it to businesses, schools, and non-profits; you can do this with a poli sci, but in my experience having the more international focus tends to draw more attention

-interesting, relevant subject material

-makes study abroad much easier credit-wise

Cons:

-you'll probably end up working abroad/in DC 

-you'll most likely work for the government or a non-profit (although businesses might take you, especially you have honed your language skills), meaning the pay isn't that fantastic

-it's so broad it's hard to narrow down what you want to focus on",best major to study in college
