27300,best stocks to buy,"1) VTI/VOO/SPY -index funds are always the safest and best long term play due the average investor, board market find are the best out of these.

2) tech: AAPL -huge moat, AAPL also has a nice stock split history and looks to become a strong dividend growth stock

3) consumer cyclical: KMB -also a huge moat, as well as providing necessary products (you can skip soda, or chips, but not toilet paper or diapers)

4) health: JNJ -moat like everything else, and doesn't depend heavily on parents (patents*, woops) which could expire in the next decade

5) energy: XOM -has a high level of planning/forsight, and seems to listen to shareholder meetings, meaning it'll likely keep up with changing energy trends."

16495,best sunglasses for fashion,"> Off 5th also have great quality options at good prices.

Yes! I've seen some amazing deals on designer sunglasses at Off 5th. Granted, I love crazy styles, so some of it is kinda niche. That said, they have a lot of great classics too."

37267,best amusement park,"It's not even close. Michigan's adventure best coaster is as good as some of cedar points worst rides, like gemini.

It's worth riding Michigan's Adventure wooden coaster solely because of the airtime, but the rest of the park is basically nothing."

43308,best ad service for mobile applications,The best alternative one is Facebook Audience Network.
69849,best major to study in college,"I majored in International Studies, but close enough. 

Tips:

-study abroad as much as you can

-internships every summer

-learn a foreign language

-specialize in a region of the world (preferably Asia or the Middle East)

-ideally, match your specialization with your study abroad experience and language choice (ex - if you want to focus on the Middle East, study in the Middle East/North Africa and study Arabic)


Pros:

-flexible, more so than poli sci; you can get a lot of the poli sci jobs with International Relations but can also market it to businesses, schools, and non-profits; you can do this with a poli sci, but in my experience having the more international focus tends to draw more attention

-interesting, relevant subject material

-makes study abroad much easier credit-wise

Cons:

-you'll probably end up working abroad/in DC 

-you'll most likely work for the government or a non-profit (although businesses might take you, especially you have honed your language skills), meaning the pay isn't that fantastic

-it's so broad it's hard to narrow down what you want to focus on"
