51760,best iphone case,The newer defender feels more like a commuter with port covers.  Doesn't have the integrated screen protector anymore and edges are shorter.
70464,best major to study in college,"To be fair, we wouldn't have to act superior if everyone would just realize that we are better than them /s

7098,best iPhone,"Trying to decide between the iPhone 11 and Pro right now. Not sure how I feel about OLED I wouldn't say I need it, but the extra battery life from it would be nice and my main reason for upgrading. Don't really need the extra camera, and the smaller size would be nice since i'm upgrading to get rid of the 6s+ size I have right now, but i've also heard it's ""too small"" as well. Seems to be bigger than my relatives iPhone 6 tho and that's what i'd consider too small these days."
67271,axios alternatives reddit,"or still supporting IE11.

**Edit:** come to think of it, that does count as doing something weird."

72499,best keyboard switches,"I know what you mean when you say it's 100% preference. I had used regular dome keyboards for probably 15 years so when I researched the different mechanical keys by reading about it, I thought for sure I'd like red or browns the best. That being said, once I actually felt the red and brown key switches, I hated it. They were far too soft with no tactile response which I didn't like at all. After much more research I settled on clear keys and am more than happy about it. So to OP, all you can really do is try some out at your nearest pc place and find what you like best for your needs."

34021,best Pokemon game,"Ahh I should have worked that out haha sorry, thank you friend I will see if I can pick one or two of them up!"
13516,best research paper archive,"Nah, as a student and as a researcher, it's impossible to ask every author whose work you cite or reference in your stuff. I'd spend all of my time contacting people instead of actually doing real work. Everybody I've talked to [in academia] is fine with sci-hub and uses it themselves. In the end, the authors of this stuff don't care where you get their paper from, as long as it's cited formally and appropriately. It does far more for the author than wasting their time contacting them personally or getting it from the publisher - imagine if everybody across the globe asked individual authors for a copy of their paper, who has the time for that?"
