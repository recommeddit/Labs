8065,best toothpaste,I expect a 9/10 ratio of agreement before I'll believe any of you.
32760,best vacation resort,"I have to be honest here - Your budget is probably too small. It definitely is not going to get you ""the best.""  I don't really know you could do this without a super cheap flight / transport and zero activities. Where are you flying from? Secrets is a mid-to-high range brand and I don't know that you could cut it with that amount.  You could try to book a 'run of the house' room which is usually not a desirable one but cheaper than others.

&#x200B;

try to break down the costs:

flight - If you could get a good deal, $200 maybe? Right now I am looking at prices from ATL (very close to CUN) and they are between 200-400. There is a lot of pent up demand and still reduced capacity.

5 days, 4 nights - so (850-200)/4  = 162 a night.usually rooms are booked for 2 guests maybe you can get a discount if you only have 1 person but I have never investigated that

a room at a Secrets resort right now, even in August, is looking like $250-350 a night.

if you are young/traveling alone and would consider a hostel, you could do that and go to beach clubs. Or go with a less expensive hotel with less amenities.  I will say for myself that I love Secrets and it is worth it to me, but I really get a lot of the amenities (pool, sports, gym, spa, a lot of restaurants, etc.). If you just want to enjoy the beach and drink, you can do that in a less expensive hotel."

35903,best alcoholic drink,"My friend's ex was a semi-pro bodybuilder and while on cuts, did this drinking routine that he called The Skinny Russian. He'd start with two and a half shots of straight vodka. Then he'd sip club soda with ice. Then after exactly an hour, he'd take another shot of vodka to maintain his buzz. He'd continue this until two hours before he'd plan to stop drinking. It seemed to work really well for him."
25908,best cricket teams of all time,"Nobody wanted to lose, I guess. I can see why ODIs seemed so exciting, at least we had a sure winner at the end of the day's play.

20 of the 26 tests played between India and Pakistan in the 80s were drawn (although it may also have been motivated by political conflict between the two countries)."
44807,best items under $100,"Anti depression meds, but I'm cheating a bit as they were 102$ a month. Slashed my useless spending by many many hundreds a month for $102 of meds.
