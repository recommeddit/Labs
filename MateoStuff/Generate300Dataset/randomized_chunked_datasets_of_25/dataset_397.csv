32760,"I have to be honest here - Your budget is probably too small. It definitely is not going to get you ""the best.""  I don't really know you could do this without a super cheap flight / transport and zero activities. Where are you flying from? Secrets is a mid-to-high range brand and I don't know that you could cut it with that amount.  You could try to book a 'run of the house' room which is usually not a desirable one but cheaper than others.

&#x200B;

try to break down the costs:

flight - If you could get a good deal, $200 maybe? Right now I am looking at prices from ATL (very close to CUN) and they are between 200-400. There is a lot of pent up demand and still reduced capacity.

5 days, 4 nights - so (850-200)/4  = 162 a night.usually rooms are booked for 2 guests maybe you can get a discount if you only have 1 person but I have never investigated that

a room at a Secrets resort right now, even in August, is looking like $250-350 a night.

if you are young/traveling alone and would consider a hostel, you could do that and go to beach clubs. Or go with a less expensive hotel with less amenities.  I will say for myself that I love Secrets and it is worth it to me, but I really get a lot of the amenities (pool, sports, gym, spa, a lot of restaurants, etc.). If you just want to enjoy the beach and drink, you can do that in a less expensive hotel.",best vacation resort
