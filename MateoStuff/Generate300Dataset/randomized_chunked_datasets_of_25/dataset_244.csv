11209,best backpack for college,"Depending on what you expect to be doing during/after college, I'd invest in a leather messenger bag.   When you start doing internships/interviews, it looks a lot more professional than a backpack, and your schedule shouldn't be so hellish that you need to carry more than a laptop, a notebook and two books at one time."

34451,best NFL player,"I am going to disagree on the point that no position can impact like a QB.  A GOAT candidate WR or RB can be more valuable and more impactful in the right situation. 

Edit:  Y'all can't think of any situation that ever happened where the #1 WR or RB was more important than any QB in the league?

In case you need help, RB has been MVP 14 times since 1975.  Jerry Rice is the only receiver to have won MVP, and Lawrence Taylor has also won."

617,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"I strongly suggest you take a look at cyberghost and Mullvad. There are hundreds of VPN services. I wouldn't necessarily advise someone to give them all a shot. Assuming some VPN services are unsafe, unreliable or malware, your advice would include an unnecessary exposure to risk. The only somewhat reputable [VPN trial](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/) is the one from Nord. Many others are pretty sketchy and shady."

13238,best gifts for mom,"I think the best thing you can do is to truly treat her job like a real job (it is one), and split the work 50/50 when you get home. No trinket is really going to communicate that you appreciate her if you treat your work like the ""real job"" and her job as a 24/hour responsibility she's never allowed to escape."
