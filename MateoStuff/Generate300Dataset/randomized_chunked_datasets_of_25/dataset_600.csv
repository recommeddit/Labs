65797,best college in california,I was a little unclear...you can grant some PhD’s but none of the CSU’s are designated as PhD granting institutions.  Someone posts the actual verbiage below.

48355,best color to paint with,"You're right. I was more making a joke with white vs 'color' rather than (bright) white vs tones or shades of white.

BM Swiss Coffee may or may not be wonderful for OP but he can't tell that without knowing what the rest of his palette are going to be."
6871,best iPhone,"Hard desicion between the 11 and the extra cost for the minor upgrades on the 12. Just the Design ist pretty awesome. But is it worth 200€ idk. 

Thanks for your reply"

29425,best game console,I still think uncharted series is better than the last of us.
26528,best board games,"I love both Splendor and Dominion, but i would definitely recommend Splendor for new gamers. Neither game has much of a theme, but Splendor has better art and a more intuitive engine building system."
17178,best iOS game,"Terraria, Baldur’s Gate"
3577,best college for research,"Definitely stuff like watching youtube vids and talking to students (see if the school offers informal interviews, webinars, etc etc), choosing based on ranks alone is really not it bc you can't write on your why x school essay something like 'oh you're number one in cs' and expect them to choose you for that reason. I also highly recommend just setting aside 2-3 hrs (and no more than that!!) to browse through a school's websites and identify cool programs, research, values, clubs that the school has, particularly anything unique to that school. that should give you a good idea of whether or not you want to go, and solid 'why x school' supp material if you do!"
7869,best laptop for general use,"I'm not quite sure about what games you actually play. For non-demanding games like CS:GO or Rocket League, I'd say the 11th Gen i5-1135G7 Acer Swift 3 would be a pretty nice fit even though it's not in the list above. You might also want to look at some previous Gen laptops with 1050ti or MX350 graphics considering that they might have a pretty nice value right now.

&#x200B;

Maybe I should add that to the list."
16462,best sunglasses for fashion,"Big fan of han kjobenhavn's

These projects are my favorites not only because I think they’re phenomenal but because the memories they bring up when listening to them. I will always come back and listen to these from from to back.

No particular order.
Included mixtapes Idk if that counts. 
Excluded Eminem from the list cuz I feel like he’s on everyone else’s."

46723,best hand santizer brand,Dont buy any of that stuff right now at all. QA is being sacrificed to pump out the products. Thermometers from china are notorious for this. Lots of scams. And also just buy top dollar bandaid too. I got offbrand once. It sucked. Couldnt stick.
