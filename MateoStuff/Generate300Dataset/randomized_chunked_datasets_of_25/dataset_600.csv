3577,"Definitely stuff like watching youtube vids and talking to students (see if the school offers informal interviews, webinars, etc etc), choosing based on ranks alone is really not it bc you can't write on your why x school essay something like 'oh you're number one in cs' and expect them to choose you for that reason. I also highly recommend just setting aside 2-3 hrs (and no more than that!!) to browse through a school's websites and identify cool programs, research, values, clubs that the school has, particularly anything unique to that school. that should give you a good idea of whether or not you want to go, and solid 'why x school' supp material if you do!",best college for research

For non-demanding games like CS:GO or Rocket League, I'd say the 11th Gen i5-1135G7 Acer Swift 3 would be a pretty nice fit even though it's not in the list above. You might also want to look at some previous Gen laptops with 1050ti or MX350 graphics considering that they might have a pretty nice value right now.
