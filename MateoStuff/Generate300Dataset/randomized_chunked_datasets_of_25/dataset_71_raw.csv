"Thanks for sharing!  For my 12 pro I ended up with the [SupCase Unicorn Beetle Clear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HVJTX28/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (quite the name). I like the feel and wanted to be able to see the nice pacific blue phone color.   But, now seeing the Ringke, I think I just might have to try that one out.  Definitely hits all the right (other) buttons."
"I switched from vscode back to vim. Somehow the performance of the vscode has gotten a bit worse than it was before. It gets laggy and sometimes even freezes when opening very large workspaces, or when you accidentally open very large file. I was using the vim extension with vscode, but i think it made the performance worse.

You get pretty much same vscode functions and tools out of the vim if you install right plugins and configs."
"You mentioned the word 'joke'. Chuck Norris doesn't joke. 
Here is a fact about Chuck Norris: 

 >Only Chuck Norris shuts down websites without due process, not SOPA or PIPA."
I am embarrassed now.
my guess is to buy an used rtx or a 1080
"Only Trent, Hendo, Foden, Sancho Grealish, Sterling, Kane and maybe Mount are (potentially) world class, most others are just very expensive for being English. France definetly has a better and more valuable pool of players by quite a lot."
"Madoka, Lain and Haruhi all in the top 10. Now that's a top I can get behind."
Do you have a link? I can‚Äôt seem to find that color! They look so freaking beautiful!
"Zoom is ok, you seen Google Meet? Makes zoom look good in comparison."
Your color adjectives really help me visualize everything in the story. Thank you lol.
"True, but in comparison to the Daily Mail they are infallible"
"Ehh, not the 3 year panel swap, but that might be a good reason to get it fro. dell.

I got the monitor for $810 CDN total and on Amazon it goes for $1080 with tax and everything.

So I could spend the extra $270 for shipping, but that is a lot of money for a monitor and I'd probably get a 1440p 165hz monitor instead."
Only got this t-shirt...
Lol so specific and right lol I‚Äôve got a couple leather clothes
man i cannot stand that kid.
"dude, i'm not that bad."
"That's part of the thrill lol. But nah fr, it's mostly for the instrumental that makes King's Dead a good workout song for me"
"I‚Äôm not sure if the Brazilian pandeiro would be classified as a tambourine for these purposes, but there‚Äôs a whole lot of technique that goes into playing that."
Then you know that's what he said.
"things you want! 

when I was researching colleges my list comprised mostly of the best programs for my major then location. 

after I was accepted, since I already knew that each of them had amazing programs for my major I started looking into things I wanted. I wanted a cityish environment, close proximity to a chipotle, maybe a target too, has club lacrosse, study abroad options, outside opportunities for undergrad in the area. 

I did these after I was accepted into my schools to narrow down where to go but you could definitely do this with your current college research"
"""Good  . . . for . .  you, Marty!"" So very snide."
"What's the opinon on natural toothpaste like [Tom's](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/76304/300.jpg)?

Now I know what everyone's thinking but I have zero inclination towards things simply because of a ""natural"" or ""organic label; but regular toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling like it's been violated. I can't stop tonguing my teeth after and everything tastes like crap for the next hour or so."
Basically what it says on the tin. Hover over a picture or a link to a pic and it will show it to you. Pretty handy for reddit.

Just don't get the water based paint even if it's from the brands mentioned. it oxidizes faster than latex. I'd also look into getting ceiling paint from whatever brand you pick and not just regular white. for for bathrooms use the kitchen and bath paint instead of just regular semi gloss
