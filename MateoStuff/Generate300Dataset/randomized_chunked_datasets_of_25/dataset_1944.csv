67639,axios alternatives reddit,"Sure, and then you run the risk of somebody showing up and publishing malicious packages under a vastly popular name. So you've got to vet them thoroughly, and there's another big task with high stakes.

Also your scales are off. Happy pack is about 1/25th the downloads, and node/jquery/etc are all wayyyy larger. Not to mention, Node **was** forked after the community decided that the foundation wasn't keeping pace with standards and the community. Look up IO.js."

71894,best movies with a cool twist,"He may have run the risk of running into another Cutter style situation (was that the actors name?). Angiers past experience was that he was never the man on the stage, never the prestige, and never experienced that applause first hand because he was hidden underneath. He wants to be the man on the stage in order to a) be the prestige and b) beat Borden at his own trick. 

Two Angiers running around could have potentially ruined their own lives. Borden and Fallon have a life long commitment to their art, which Angier (and therefore his exact duplicate) cannot and will not understand. They would fight and argue just as before as he and Cutter did. This is why he has a gun during his first experiment. 

The aspect I LOVE about this is what Angier says toward the end - not knowing if he's on stage or the man in the box. He doesn't know either, so in theory the ""original"" Angier could have been that first copy that was shot dead..."
