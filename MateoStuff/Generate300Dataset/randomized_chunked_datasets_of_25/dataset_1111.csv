1434,best ice cream flavor,#*__YESS__*
70093,best major to study in college,"Hireability has less to do with the major and more to do with the person. I'm a creative writing major with a minor in cinematic arts and I'm currently heading my own department at a marketing firm. I've taken my love of learning and critical thinking and made it into something that works for me. 

Hell, college majors don't matter with the exception of incredibly specialized skill sets. Having a degree just shows employers that you can accomplish something you set out to."

46294,best trick or treating candy,"I'm a stickler for all the kids saying ""trick or treat!"", if I don't hear one of them say it, I nicely say ""I didn't hear you say it, come on, no candy if you don't say it.""

I also shout Happy Halloween! when I open the door."
45461,best gaming system,Great console if you enjoy racing games i suggest need for speed most wanted the original. The Fable trilogy are also great games.
53236,best usb c charging cable,"I second this. They are comparable to Anker in regards to quality, they most likely won't offer the same support as Anker and Amazon. They are all chinese, and just like every other company they have good and not so good products. So far I've only had good experiences with them."
26090,best politician,"OK. starting to make sense now. The bastardisation of the constitution and bill of rights over time pretty much enabled all your political insanity (Not saying it's bad, I have no clue. But I think the process, like most countries is ridiculously convoluted.) . So in effect, the earlier Presidents were more just figureheads (like they should be) as opposed to delusional twits thinking they are somehow personally responsible for political and therefore social change. 

One thing is for sure. I am going to read up on US history. I am definitely no fan of US foreign policies (Vietnamese family members, and I lived in the middle east for 4 years... probably bias! hehe) but the history is some amazing reading."
21699,best winnie the pooh comic,"I don't think pooh is mean. He's just very simple minded, so what he say is so straightforward it sounds mean."

48964,best gaming monitor,Oh shit I just noticed your post is the one that made me decide to get it! Thanks for the write-up! I loved it and it helped me make my decision. :)
37224,best amusement park,"Same. No coaster enthusiest would pick it over Knotts, most of the time. That said, walking around in the parks and laying for crappy food does nothing for me so Knotts brings pretty much nothing extra to the table."
67497,axios alternatives reddit,"I love axios, but I found it super advantageous to wrap common calls, GET, POST, PUT, in isolated functions that return just the data from the calls.  It made it really easy when I wanted to migrate to another lib."
26553,best board games,"My very first game of Desert I played by myself to learn the rules. Normally, I find a solo learning game to be really boring, but in this one I managed to enjoy the experience, especially thanks to the way it ended:

I was down to my very last drop of water. I had gathered all of the pieces of the ship and was making my way back to the launch pad with no equipment or anything. I try with all my might to reach the pad, but I stop just one move short. GREAT, I think, this is it. It's time for the storm, and if I draw one sun beats down card then I'm dead.

I start drawing and the storm is doing its thing, and on the last card the storm BLOWS ME AWAY from the launch pad and buries me, salvation suddenly further out of reach. Through sheer calculation and determination I was able to land on the launch pad with my final action and win the game.

Since then, me and my friends and family have played it countless times."
3416,best webcamera,Why do you not need more than 720p for twitch? Am I wasting bandwidth by streaming from PS4 at 1080p60fps?
25515,best cricket teams of all time,"I think VVS Laxman influenced Indian batting more than anyone else. Batting at No.6 with Sehwag, Dravid, Sachin and Ganguly ahead of him and averaging 45+. He won more Test matches for India with his 3rd, 4th innings masterclass than anyone else I can remember."
56230,best action and adventure movie,Last crusade while I like it a lot is a Raiders rehash with more sitcom humor. I actually prefer temple over crusade.
