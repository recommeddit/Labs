26090,"OK. starting to make sense now. The bastardisation of the constitution and bill of rights over time pretty much enabled all your political insanity (Not saying it's bad, I have no clue. But I think the process, like most countries is ridiculously convoluted.) . So in effect, the earlier Presidents were more just figureheads (like they should be) as opposed to delusional twits thinking they are somehow personally responsible for political and therefore social change. 

One thing is for sure. I am going to read up on US history. I am definitely no fan of US foreign policies (Vietnamese family members, and I lived in the middle east for 4 years... probably bias! hehe) but the history is some amazing reading.",best politician

26553,"My very first game of Desert I played by myself to learn the rules. Normally, I find a solo learning game to be really boring, but in this one I managed to enjoy the experience, especially thanks to the way it ended:

I was down to my very last drop of water. I had gathered all of the pieces of the ship and was making my way back to the launch pad with no equipment or anything. I try with all my might to reach the pad, but I stop just one move short. GREAT, I think, this is it. It's time for the storm, and if I draw one sun beats down card then I'm dead.

I start drawing and the storm is doing its thing, and on the last card the storm BLOWS ME AWAY from the launch pad and buries me, salvation suddenly further out of reach. Through sheer calculation and determination I was able to land on the launch pad with my final action and win the game.

Since then, me and my friends and family have played it countless times.",best board games
