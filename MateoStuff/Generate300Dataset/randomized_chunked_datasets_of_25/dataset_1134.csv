53782,best medicine for a cold,"THIS.

With plenty of sriracha sauce and lime juice, wrapped in blankets and watching bad television, followed by a long nap.

It may not actually cure anything but you sure as hell feel better.

EDIT- Thank you, kind stranger, for reminding me what makes me feel better and making me realize I can order Pho online for delivery so I don't have to go out in the cold. I would give you Reddit Gold, but I just spent the money on a bowl of Pho. *internet hug* I love you anyways."

54834,best water filter,"I don't have some of my lit on disinfection with me right now (nor can I find what I'm looking for online)

I realize I said spore, but I mean cyst.  (I'm not a microbiologist, sorry!)
Cysts tend to be really hardy, because they've evolved to protect the genetic material in harsh conditions. Viruses also are pretty hardy.  

I'm also referring to disinfection, not just chlorination. This varies greatly depending on the form of disinfection you are performing. In my field we use a something called the C-t value.  Which represents the concentration (of disinfectant in mg/l) times contact time (in minutes). You can meet these values using a variety of disinfectants (things like Free chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, or ozone). Each of these interacts with microbes differently.

There exists [something called a CT table](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fishw/UO_CT-Glossary.pdf)
which is used to determine what CT value you need to inactivate certain microbes with different disinfectants. 

To answer your question, the common cyst mentioned are Giardia cysts, which require much higher CT values.  Viruses are varied, but bacteria like E.coli tend to be pretty easy and treated by most disinfection processes pretty easily."

7744,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I’m looking to get a new laptop and would love some advice! I don’t know a TON about laptops but I’ve been working with a Mac for the past 5-6 years and I think I want to switch to a PC laptop. I largely need it for both work and schoolwork (including video conferencing), and ability to multitask would be awesome. I would like to be able to do some fairly light gaming/watch things on my laptop as well. 

It doesn’t have to be super portable as it’ll generally be confined to my apartment, but I would prefer that it isn’t crazy heavy. I’m mostly pretty tired of my 2011 laptop running really slowly and would like to avoid that problem as much as I can. My budget tops out at around $1200. Thank you in advance if you’re able to offer any suggestions!"

54181,best medicine for a cold,"No.  Ibuprofen might screw up your gut (indigestion and if you are unlucky or very persistent maybe GI bleeds) or your kidney, especially if you are dehydrated when you take it.  I haven't seen major complications to ibuprofen in my 30 years of practice.  Acetaminophen is better known for causing liver problems.  Aspirin is known to cause platelets to fail (probably more effective at this than ibuprofen) which also increases the risk of bleeding.  Naproxen isn't an over the counter drug here in Canada (that I know of) so I am less familiar with its common side effects."

I went for the LG.

So here are the finalized two websites I used to determine my pick, they're highly recommended, got to the same results I did by manually filtering them, with perfect tools for the job (wish I could've had their sort for picking my perfect case):

https://www.productchart.com/monitors/
A monitor filtering system, to help you prioritize and filter your options by classes.

https://versus.com/en/monitor
A monitor comparing site, for the small details between two models of the same line, two competing models and the such.

54964,best water filter,Correct most municipalities will use activated carbon after the disinfection process.  This removes VOC's in the water as well as the residual disinfection byproducts created.  This also is part of an ongoing effort by the EPA to reduce the byproducts which are harmful in the long term.

62778,Best Data Science textbook,"I liked: [Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Data+Smart%3A+Using+Data+Science+to+Transform+Information+into+Insight+&ia=products) by John W. Foreman is a great introduction., and is great for even those who are good with Data Science.

From a [**review**](http://statisticalprogramming.net/blogs/01/01/) on [statisticalprogramming.net](http://statisticalprogramming.net): ""I’ve read several of introductory Data Science books, and this is hands down the most fun. It’s light\-heated with a quick pace. Demanding enough to make you strain, but with enough energy to be hungry for more.""

He uses Excel \(stay with me, there’s a good reason\) to teach essential Data Science concepts \(Machine Learning, Optimization, AI\) in a simple way then transitions the reader to R. I hate Excel too for the most part, but he has a reason for using Excel.

A few quotes from the book on why he chose it.:

>""Spreadsheets are not the sexiest tools around. In fact, they’re the Wilford\-Brimley\-selling\- Colonial\-Penn of the analytics tool world. Completely unsexy. Sorry, Wilford. ""

>""This is not a book about coding. In fact, I’m giving you my “no code” guarantee \(until Chapter 10 at least\). Why?  Because I don’t want to spend a hundred pages at the beginning of this book messing with Git, setting environment variables, and doing the dance of Emacs versus Vi.""

>""Now, this is all a bit of a lie. The final chapter in this book is actually on moving to the data science\-focused programming language, R. It’s for those of you that want to use this book as a jumping point to deeper things. ""

>""But that’s the point. Spreadsheets stay out of the way. They allow you to see the data and to touch \(or at least click on\) the data. There’s a freedom there. In order to learn these techniques, you need something vanilla, something everyone understands, but nonethe\- less, something that will let you move fast and light as you learn. That’s a spreadsheet. ""

>""Say it with me: 'I am a human. I have dignity. I should not have to write a map\-reduce job in order to learn data science.' ""

>""And spreadsheets are great for prototyping! You’re not running a production AI model for your online retail business out of Excel, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look at purchase data, experiment with features that predict product interest, and prototype a targeting model. In fact, it’s the perfect place to do just that. """
