70028,"Becoming a lawyer is a crap-shoot. The top of the class in the top law schools can land jobs with incredible starting pay and insane hours. Unless that is you, (remember, your competing against other people who did great in college, so its going to be much harder than excelling in undergrad) or you have family connections that will get you a job as a lawyer after graduation, going into the law is a very risky proposition. There are huge numbers of law grads that have either left the legal field, or are barely getting by on contract work that pays less than jobs you can get without law school, or are barely scratching a living out of solo practice. Oh yeah, and you will probably graduate with $100k+ in debt, many are over $200k.",best major to study in college

Despite its cover, the game's actually really good. It has an interesting and somewhat dark-ish story, some really fun and challenging puzzles and overall it's a very unique experience. While probably not fit for your average Call of Duty-fanboy, I often end up recommending it to peasants in my vicinity.

You have to enjoy puzzles though, and learn to think with boxes.",best game console
