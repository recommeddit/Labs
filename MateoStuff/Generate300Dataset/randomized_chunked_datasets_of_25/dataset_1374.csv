70028,best major to study in college,"Becoming a lawyer is a crap-shoot. The top of the class in the top law schools can land jobs with incredible starting pay and insane hours. Unless that is you, (remember, your competing against other people who did great in college, so its going to be much harder than excelling in undergrad) or you have family connections that will get you a job as a lawyer after graduation, going into the law is a very risky proposition. There are huge numbers of law grads that have either left the legal field, or are barely getting by on contract work that pays less than jobs you can get without law school, or are barely scratching a living out of solo practice. Oh yeah, and you will probably graduate with $100k+ in debt, many are over $200k."

37153,best amusement park,"I would do Busch Gardens one day and Sea World another. That worked out well for me. Let me tell you though, marathoning Mako for 17 rides almost killed me. Don't do that. Lol"
8705,best toothpaste,"Not ideal. Would usually recommend that for older children, but it’s better than no fluoride at all!"
10507,best suitcase lock,Where r u hiking from?
23392,best car racing video game,"This looks amazing (not played), I don't understand why it's not talked about at all, assumed it was a bit rubbish... hence I've not played it."
15316,best tree for the garden,Red maple
37852,best Marvel movie,Yea the acclaim this is getting is odd. I personally thought it was good and I'm sure some people could make a case for it being in their top ten but best ever? Did they forget about Infinity War and Winter Soldier? The hype will fade off and they'll come to their senses.
70526,best major to study in college,LOL!!
64123,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Does anyome know a site for downloading complete manga volumes ?

32710,best vacation resort,Seems entirely overpriced to me.
29563,best game console,"Nice list, though it's missing [Catherine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_\(video_game\)).

Despite its cover, the game's actually really good. It has an interesting and somewhat dark-ish story, some really fun and challenging puzzles and overall it's a very unique experience. While probably not fit for your average Call of Duty-fanboy, I often end up recommending it to peasants in my vicinity.

You have to enjoy puzzles though, and learn to think with boxes."
40091,best Chrome extensions,Thanks for suggesting Just Read! I'm glad people find it useful.
33436,best electric car,"Its ridiculous to watch some times.

*Tesla delays release of Cybertruck*

/r/cars ""Tesla is a failure! Typical! What a shitty company that can't do anything right!""

*GM delays release of Hummer EV*
