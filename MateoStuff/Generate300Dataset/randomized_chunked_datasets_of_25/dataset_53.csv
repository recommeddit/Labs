70419,"All the academic advisers and professors in the liberal arts use the ""well rounded"" excuse too. When I first transferred to my school this lady went on a tirade about how a liberal arts education is essential in today's world...because a degree in ""Minority Studies"" is going to land you 6 figures.

 Business is actually useful, but I would recommend specializing in an area like finance. ""Well rounded"" means full of useless information and a 4 year liberal brainwashing you're never going to need and that isn't going to do jack to get you a decent job.",best major to study in college

64685,"I went by the store today and tried them on. They are pretty sweet. I have this years 5.0 free runs and the free flyknits. They did feel less cushioned/thinner compared to either 5.0's. They do have a lower drop. I liked how they felt. The insole is lunarlon, but cut up in a way that it resembles a free run. What I really liked was the feel of this flyknit compared to the free fly's. The free fly's, as comfy as they were, got really constricting after a long day of wearing them. I got used to how snug they were initially wearing them. But with the hyper feels, it isn't as constricting. They used fly wire alllll over the flyknit upper. It def didn't feel loose but wasn't constricting, compared to the free fly's which felt a tad bit stiffer. 

There is also a trail version of the hyperfeel's which I didn't know till I saw we had them in stock haha.  

If you get the chance try them out! Just look away at the price tag :(",Best Nike running shoes

Kourtney- obviously depressed, totally treated like the redheaded stepchild. Kris is making her do the show, kourt must oblige to get her paycheck.


Khloe - mean mean mean, about to be even more mean and hateful. Verbally abusive, rushed to get prego so she could fit in with all the other sisters treating these precious babies like the hottest accessory. I will never believe she shares the same dad as Kim or kourt.

11083,"What do you wear? Do you use your bag for anything other than laptop/books? How much do you usually carry? How much do you want to spend? So on. Without more info the suggestions are all over the place. That being said, here's my two cents:

Super cheap: look around a few thrift stores and see what you can pick up. I've found a great duffle and a great backpack this way, both for less than $10. Also maybe check out Army/Navy surplus stores if you have any in your area. If you put in the time you can find a great, sturdy bag from a thrift or army surplus store that wil outlast any similiarly priced item from walmart or target.

Mid range: L.L. Bean and Jansport both have some basic, versatile backpacks in the $30-$60 range, and they both have a pretty broad lifetime warranty. Herschel Supply Co also has some good looking bags, but they're warranty is a little more limited.",best backpack for college
