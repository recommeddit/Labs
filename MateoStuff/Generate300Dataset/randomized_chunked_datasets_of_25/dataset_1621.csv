47447,best state to visit in the United States,"For what it’s worth, the other person replying has had a very different experience than what I’ve seen. Based on comments from coworkers who have moved here from the coasts, he’s an extreme outlier.

I’ve lived in Colorado since I was five years old except for a couple years in my 20s. The people are generally friendly if you try to be friendly yourself. When coworkers visit from other offices, the most common comment I get is, “everyone is so nice here!”

The comments on taxes and home prices are off base and are likely informed by his political ideology (judging from his comment history) — most of Colorado’s housing market has skyrocketed over the past few years, so a slump was inevitable. If you just bought a large luxury home over the summer, it might look anxiety-inducing; if you bought for more than $500K in 2016 or earlier, you’re still way ahead. Anyone under the $500K home value mark hasn’t really been impacted.

Having briefly lived in both Chicago and LA, I can easily say Denver’s quality of life is much higher, the taxes are somewhat lower (though not as low as they once were), and the scenery is beautiful. The only things you might miss are things bigger cities tend to have, like more nightlife, more variety in public transit, etc. But I think the pros outweigh the cons.

I think you’ll find Colorado is a great place to live!"
72760,best wireless lightweight mouse,"It just depends on what you value. Model O is holes, lighter, good stock skates, meh history with button wobble. Viper is no holes, average dyed skates, slightly heavier, optical switches with no debounce time. Idk which is better tbh."
72038,best movies with a cool twist,"Vater would be German.

Vader is Dutch for father.

But I enjoyed the reference."

54653,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Amazing thank you! I'll make sure to take a look at it
60109,best perfume,Noble fig by Ferarri. It lifts my mood every time I smell it. It's a very bright fragrance that I choose to wear on lazy days.
57560,best cologne,"I'm not sure why you've been downvoted but tbf when I read your first post I just assumed you'd used ""not done"" instead of ""done"", because why would any one wear a cologne for a year that they don't like. Reads a bit like an oxymoron."
20161,best workout music,"In response to this, just gotta say [Slam](https://youtu.be/gIOQfdn9L9c) for the video."
25204,best spiderman actor,"The way we think of Christopher Reeve as Superman and RDJ as Iron Man, we'll forever think of Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Calling it now."
4760,best home improvement store,"Home depot, it's closer and the employees are nicer."
26416,best politician,"I mean to be fair, people are probably not going to vote and gather around someone that was generally incompetent in their personal life for president. Seems to me very obvious that the president would have had a successful career."
69462,best major to study in college,One day I'll get my PHD in undeclared.

62419,Best RPG game on PS4,">  I feel like this is just to make sure that the games stay as accecable and maintstreamy as possible

Which is funny since games like Assassin's Creed were already pretty fucking mainstream, lol."
28687,best breakfast foods,I always forget how much indian culture influenced british colonies not in india.
39046,best web browser,sure buddy
9082,best toothpaste,"From personal experience, I gotta admit, what comes out to maybe 20 seconds of circular hand-motion beats fucking around with a string."
72409,best keyboard switches,I believe the general idea is that lower actuation force is preferred for gaming. So linear switches like Cherry MX Reds and Speed Silvers are good for that.   A lot of it comes down to personal preference though. I like having a tactile feel without the click so I go with Browns and they are more than adequate for gaming purposes.
18129,best Kardashian,"I've heard in general there is a big difference in the Kardashians vs. the Jenners lol. I don't have personal stories honestly lol. Because Kim's narrative pre Kanye was very dicey in the media I feel like her media relationship was extra important. She was always professional, always on time, always sweet to her fans. And I think she tried to push Khloe and Kourtney to do the same, but i feel like Kourtney is not really about it anymore and kinda gets more hostile with people now.

There's a host of stories about Kendall being late, a brat, not professional lol. She's not well liked in the modeling world outside of the Hadids lol.  She always comes off entitled and she hardly does any runway shows anymore.

Then of course there's the story where Kylie was supposed to open for the Balmain fashion show bc of their makeup collab. She was going to do all their makeup looks and whatnot. I know she said she was sick, but i honestly think she was so painfully anxious that she just straight up bailed lol. I was kinda surprised by that and I'm also like how is Olivier like not more mad? He still sends her outfits that she posts on insta. So it's makes me wonder if she's bailed on events before.

Her and Kendall were born famous and got like 80 million insta followers just from like existing on the show, so it makes sense that they aren't as humble, professional and media ready as Kim, Khloe and Kourtney are lol. I don't have personal stories, but that's my two cents"
7517,best laptop for general use,Still a fan of that machine?

16235,best sunglasses for fashion,[Shady Rays](https://shadyrays.com/) which come with 2 replaced pairs when you break/lose your old pair for $7 shipped so it ends up being $42 for 3 pairs of polarized sunglasses that look as good as Ray Bans. Much better than Knockarounds.
40341,best midrange CPU,"I'd expect absolutely no bottlenecking issues.

The one thing I do have to mention about the 12600K (like all 12th-gen Intel chips) is that you need to actively make sure that the cooler you buy is compatible with the new ""LGA 1700"" socket, as it has different dimensions compared to Intel's previous LGA 115*x* / 1200 sockets."
