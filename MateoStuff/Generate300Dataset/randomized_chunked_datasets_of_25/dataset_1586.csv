17748,"I think Kim. People who have worked with her always say how nice and respectful she is. Plus I think once she reached her 30s (especially after the Paris robbery) she's started thinking more about her life and legacy. The fact that she's so invested in becoming a lawyer and helping to abolish the death penalty and has started to really open her mind to thinking about other people besides the rich and famous shows that she's decent. I think Kim and her family all have moments when they are out of touch with the average person, but I get the sense that Kim is still in touch with humanity despite it all. Even when she messes up, I feel like her intention is always to do the right thing.",best Kardashian

Some planes are front heavy, so you fill the back bin, and put extra or gate checked bags in the front. You only really run into weight issues if you have a flight with like 5 bags. We use 50lb sand bags to add the needed weight.",best suitcase lock
