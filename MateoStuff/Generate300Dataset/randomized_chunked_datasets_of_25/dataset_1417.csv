15183,best tree for the garden,"I am surprised no one has recommended a redbud. There are all sorts of varieties.  For instance a red leaf variety like Forest Pansy would look great.

49107,best gaming monitor,"best one imo is the acer predator xb271hu. there is an asus variant of it as well that is the same panel but slightly more expensive due to better frame. i have the predator and i think its the best 1440p panel out there. it's like 500 bucks on sale with 27inches, 1440p, 165hz, IPS (the reason i went with this one), g-sync, HDMI +DP, and a pretty deep settings menu. i think there is a new variant of it from both manufacturers with hdr, but from what i read it's not ""true"" hdr as it's less than 1000 nits peak brightness."
