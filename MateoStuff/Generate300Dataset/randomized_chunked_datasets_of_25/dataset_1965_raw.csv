Does this seem like good value? I‚Äôd be using it primarily for running an app or two and multiple chrome tabs, streaming, etc. 

If this seems good, would you recommend an extra 8gb RAM? I‚Äôve heard 16g is becoming the new standard for Windows 10. If so, what would an additional 8g stick typically cost, and how easy is install?

Thanks so much for making this!"
"The ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù games are designed for beginners to the series. They aren‚Äôt the most exciting games and don‚Äôt pose much of a challenge, but they‚Äôll teach you what you need to know and they‚Äôre highly interactive. 

The ‚ÄúSword and Shield‚Äù games are basically the modern take on the main Pok√©mon games. They‚Äôre good if you‚Äôre looking to see the latest and greatest Pok√©mon currently has out there. They‚Äôre more difficult than ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù, but that isn‚Äôt saying much since ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù is mostly very easy.

The ‚ÄúBrilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl‚Äù games are coming out in November, and they‚Äôre the most traditional Pok√©mon experience on the Switch. They stick most closely to the original Pok√©mon formula, which some people prefer for various reasons, whether it‚Äôs nostalgia or simply because the traditional games were much more mysterious. This will probably be the most challenging of the 3 listed here, but it‚Äôs definitely not ‚Äútoo difficult‚Äù by any means."

"Yes, this event has opened my eyes to how much better off we *could* be.

I've got it down on my list after all this to go out and buy one."
You work in the fucking Grand Budapest Hotel or something?
I did the same thing. Thought I would only watch it for 15 minutes and then it sucked me in.
I narrowed it down to the Spigen Ultra Hybrid. But I can‚Äôt decide on the ‚Äúfrost black‚Äù or ‚Äúmatte black‚Äù. I want the rubbery version for more grip. Can anyone help? Thanks.

"I would consider those action adventures game with super basic rpg elements. 

So do you want open world games with basic rpg elements or actual rpg games. Like ff, nier, ni no kuni, tales series, persona, etc."

"Didn't want to spoil but yes.

Changed the whole movie IMO - from a question to a definite answer.  Most other movies they would blatantly have said character make a dastardly smile over a shoulder or something to tell the audience how really they were bad.  I liked how this film didn't force feed it, hell, it barely let you know.  That and the changes the twist makes to the story are small yet definite."

"Thanks for this useful guide.

I'd like to mention the R9 Fury is very capable at 1440p,144hz. You won't get a consistent 144fps on AAA games (100ish) but still very good with free sync."

"On weekdays city folk have toast n tea n eggs n milk. On weekends paratha, halwa poori, maleeda my fav, n eggs. 

The farmers eat heavier because they have to work the fields. They have mutton, paratha, yogurt, milk, chaach, or lassi their favorite which they drink 10 times a day."
