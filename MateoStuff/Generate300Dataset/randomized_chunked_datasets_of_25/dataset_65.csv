53655,"Yeah I am glad you mentioned that. DXM is only going to get you high at *much* higher than recommended doses.

I'm not telling you to do it or not, but if you insist on doing it, make sure that Dextromethorphan is the ONLY active ingredient. Other ingredients at those doses can severely injure you, or even kill you outright. 

Also, if you plan on doing ridiculous amounts of DXM, I recommend a trip sitter, someone who will step in if things start going haywire. I've never done it, but I know those who have.",best medicine for a cold

69752,"Graphic Design:

The market is over saturated with designers. 

Design is very subjective. No matter what jargon pro designers may throw at you about color theory and the golden ratio, when it comes down to you finding a job, it's all about if the employer likes what they see.  

The current industry is being devalued by sites like fiverr and 99designs where companies will pay pennies to get a logo or a flyer made. This make companies not value or need in house designers. 

Design agencies are very stuck up and the culture is almost always cut throat. 

The pay sucks. Depending on your city the entry level pay can fluctuate, but you will be making nowhere near the money you could be with other forms of education. 

You most likely will not be doing what you love unless you get lucky. If you become an in-house designer be prepared to only design stuff related to whatever your company specializes in for the rest of your employment there. If you're hired at an agency, you will have more opportunities to work on different brands, but may not be the brands you're interested in.",best major to study in college
