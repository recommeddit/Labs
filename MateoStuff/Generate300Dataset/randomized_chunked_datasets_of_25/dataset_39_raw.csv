I don’t think I’d have ever watched this if not for this sub putting me on. Give it a watch. You won’t regret it.
It's Two Brothers.... it's just called Two Brothers! ^^^heh
"""If Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark."" - [Richard Wilkinson](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson?language=en)"
"There is really no difference in 99% of places. Verizon is not really that much better than T-mobile in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality. The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others.

I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and my work is not far from a concert venue and my T-mobile has SO many less issues with the building than people paying more for AT&T or Verizon and when a concert is going on people I work with that have those tend to see their service more bogged down from the crowds than mine ever has.

A lot of money is spent making people think one is going to be better than the other in a big metro area or along a massive interstate, but rarely have I actually seen that be the case."
"Mason jar time:

parfait containing oats, chia, fruit and a nut butter."
Isn't that a serious abuse of antibiotics?
Yea I try and watch relevant Crash Course episodes before exams. Love that guy.
">I never felt like I had to do any side quests to keep up with my leveling. Of course, I have not finished yet, so maybe that'll change once I'm past 50 or so. 

It won't. Level 50 was the original level cap so you will never be underleveled for any (non-DLC, not sure about DLC since I was 70+ by the time first episode dropped) zones after 50. Depending on your settings, enemies might be 2 levels above or below you but you won't have to grind experience or anything of the sort to progress with the story."
Yeah so explore the various stores!  We have 2 HD nearby and I love the staff in one and in the other all I get is crap. I got an employee giving me shit for asking him to move out of my way so I can get to the register.
"I'd say so - I stopped playing in the middle of 1, but with 2 I started a second playthrough right after finishing the 1st one. Never felt lost story-wise either."
"Hell, I wouldn't even put it in Heinlein's top five, much less the overall top five."
I'm seriously considering buying the BenQ XL2411P. Anyone here has any experiences with it?
"Black raspberry.

I'm also partial to moose tracks, and two Turkey Hill flavors-- Deep Dark Chocolate and Double Dunker."
Shabba remix with Shabba Ranks on it is even better

"Can add Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood to that missing out list too. Absolute fire seam attack."
"Fwiw, Kate also seems to have a similar layout and function set to notepad++. I haven't exactly a/b compared them, but they're both very rich in features and fairly easy to figure out"
"Lowes.  Because I know where everything is. It never fails, when I go to Home Depot, I leave pissed off because I couldn't find what i was looking for."
"Bioengineering with double minors in agriculture and economics. With this, you can invent a way to make money grow on trees."
"It's literally down to preference. I like Cherry MX Blues because I can feel the actuation and the clicking is satisfying. My fiancee, on the other hand, prefers Browns because she can still sleep while I am using them."
Trust me. U don’t learn much there. Self taught + paid tutorials is better
"Since F-Zero GX doesn't really count, my second favorite racing game is Burnout Paradise."
Not exactly orange paint but [this](http://i.imgur.com/lLhF7xH.jpg) is pretty good.
"Aah! Glad to see ""Roadside Picnic"" in this thread recommended by someone else too :)"
"It was kind of a second hand gift I guess. I bought myself a red and white yeti cooler. Not the biggest one, but it was a bigger sized one. I got tired of lugging the big bastard around so I gave it to my dad on Father's Day. He loves it and has used it just about every weekend for the past 3 or 4 years. Also he's a huge Alabama fan so the color of the cooler goes well with his fandom."
