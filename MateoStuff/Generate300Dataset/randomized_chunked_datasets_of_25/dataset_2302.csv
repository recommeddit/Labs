A common pattern I've noticed on sites like Upwork is that some non-programmer makes a WordPress site, gets stuck somewhere, and posts a job that asks for a PHP developer familiar with WordPress plugins to work on their site."

In the situation where you're looking for a game that your entire gaming group will enjoy, I think that a standard 100-1 point ranked list may work better here because it rewards games that a large number of reviewers rank highly."
