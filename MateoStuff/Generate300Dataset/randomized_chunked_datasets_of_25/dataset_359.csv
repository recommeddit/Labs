42563,best detective show,I always forget about this one but it was quite good!
70860,best movies with a cool twist,Chinatown (1974) -- plot
44336,best items under $100,"So, did I answer the question?"
12278,best gifts for dad,Mi band if you want the cheaper (and in some ways better e.g. battery life) equivalent.
34743,best NFL player,Yes that is correct. Doesn't change the fact that the way of comparing seasons would be more fair and more accurate by years in the league side by side.
52843,best hiphop album,"Everybody thinks that Logic remix is trash. Royce said Logic was supposed to be the original, but they couldn't shoot the music video, so Em got on it."
70615,best major to study in college,"The intro class here at USC was very hard. It had me questioning my major. A lot of comp ling people go into natural language processing or speech technology/recognition type work. Just about all of those positions require at least a graduate degree in computational linguistics though, so that's why grad school at UW was the next step for me. We had a guest lecturer in USC's LING 285 and apparently she worked at Disney doing some kind of sentiment analysis job, so I guess we can wind up just about anywhere tasks need to be performed on language. I personally would want to work at like Amazon (Alexa stuff). I am finishing up my thesis project over the summer, so fingers crossed I land somewhere cool. I'm so done with school for the time being, haha."
61716,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yes definitely! I’ve already got it on my phone, so I’m looking forward to be able to play it on a console instead"
50492,best rap album,This needs to be at the top of this thread. This album is not only beautifully produced but the best example of effective sampling in rap ive ever heard.
6675,best iPhone,"My suggestion is a Xiaomi or a Moto. Moto are built to last, they run smooth, and have decent everything for their price point. They might not have a flagship camera, but they can often outperform flagships in battery life, they just aren't pretty and lack bells and whistles"
10590,best suitcase lock,Wouldn't the evidence be that you have stuff missing from your luggage?

68025,best science fiction novel,Dune is easily one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. I haven't had that same feeling from reading a book since I read The Lord of the Rings for the first time.
53927,best medicine for a cold,But isn't it bad that we stop the draining? Because isn't the cough and snot for trying to take out the infection?
8899,best toothpaste,"dentist here.  it is abrasive.  in fact, its very abrasive.  i usually recommend against it for that reason.  but do whatever YOUR dentist says, he's seen your teeth and i havent."
1590,best ice cream flavor,"I was thinking of a sweet potato ice cream with some caramel; I'm glad you mentioned it as being good.

Soy powder ice cream. Does that change the consistency at all?"
3759,best college for research,"I think results based on research score really only tell half the tale of a university's ranking. I can see my university there. If results were published based off some metric concerning undergraduate performance, it wouldn't even come close. 

The facilities for undergraduate engineers is quite abysmal - the primary concern is for the college to push you through the assembly line as fast as possible over 4 years and try to scare you into taking a post-grad by not allowing you to become a chartered engineer with our national governing engineering body with just a B.A. - thus bolstering their research numbers. The standard of teaching skill among lecturers is awful. Very few with teaching qualifications, just incredibly intelligent people doing research forced into lecturing as a part of their contract/bit of money on the side. There's really no effort put into cultivating an atmosphere of learning and curiousity.
