"I'd bet that the fee he charges is embarrassingly large, and that he doesn't mind a bit."
"I live in miami. I saw him in a restraunt and I know he must get hassled alot, so even though I'm a big fan I didn't say anything to him. Almost everyone else in the restraunt was running up to him and trying to take pictures with him, but he was just trying to enjoy his meal. My friends were going to go up to him, but I stopped them and said, Just leave him be to finish his food. Well, he must have seen this ordeal because before he left, he came over, paid for my lunch and thanked me for respecting his privacy. We started talking for a little while and he's actually seems pretty intelligent/really nice/ and very humble. All in all it was a great experience and I have a newfound respect for him."
"The HD CEO is just as bad as the Menard's guy, so it's a crapshoot"
"I'm reading Pandora's star. I'm about a third way into it.  I simply don't care about what is going on. I'm thinking about stopping.  If I didn't like the first third, do you think the remaining of the book would change my mind?"
"Summer intern:

Can of diet coke, and a packet of dried ramen. 
Its not as bad as you think."
"Also, The Train."
"It gets better each phase. I'm on a rewatch of the MCU and just finished Phase 1. They are okay, but really not as great as I remember. It's because we were spoiled by phase 3. I was almost dreading watching The Avengers, maybe I misremembered how great it is. Fortunately, the movie is still just as great as ever, maybe even better after Endgame."
"1) Nursing entails math and lots of science (biology and chemistry, specifically--it all deals with the human body and the medicines to help treat it).

2) Don't become a nurse for the money. If that's your sole reason for doing it, you'll be a shitty nurse. Nobody wants to be (or have a loved one be) in the care of a shitty nurse."

"Can this be done on i7 11.2.6 ? Or only 12.x ? 
If so how?"
"It decrescendos, just slowly lol"
1660 super?
Hien still has pretty good control. I think you'd be ok going from ac+to hien.
i don't suppose posting them as a comment is legal either is it?

"On this board specifically, I feel like I recommend Mimi Matthews over and over and over, lol. Her historical romances are fade-to-black, which is typically not my taste at all, but she just writes with wonderful emotional depth and attention to detail. I also love her Pinterest boards for each book. My favorites of hers are probably **A Convenient Fiction** and **The Work of Art**.

Similar to this, I've been wanting to start a thread for ""books you love that don't get enough hype."" I have a couple books that I really enjoyed and always want to recommend, but I feel like they never quite fit in any threads!"
"I love LouLou, and Cacharel in general. I also enjoy Anais Anais and the controversial Eden."
"The key to restoring a bag after compromising the zipper is the ability to freely pass the zipper back over the opened area. If your bag as a secondary “lock holder” point then you can secure the zippers to a point in the bag making it more difficult to restore it without evidence. eBags actually does this on their house brand bags. 

Another method I use with a lock is a low strength brightly colored zip tie through the zippers. This allows for quick identification if your bag has been opened by security outside of your presence. I have done this on pelicans and suitcases and generally makes for a failsafe check on inspection. I have even had TSA replace a zip tie with their own after inspection (generally only with pelicans). Just removed to either have a small nail clipper on an exterior pocket or ask a hotel front desk for a pair of scissors, if the zip tie is small enough it is also possible to use the lock as leverage and break the tie as well."
Yes but if you alias vi as vim is vim as good as ed? Does that mean nvim is as  good as nano :^)?
"They have an even more basic model for $30. 
I've been using that one for two months now and the last time I went into a dentist, they told me I didn't need to schedule a teeth cleaning. That has NEVER happened."
"Chuck Norris- tipped me $150 bucks... on a $30 bill, was right around the time the Chuck Norris jokes were becoming popular, and while i was taking the order I overheard a coworker make one of the jokes, saw chucks face just sorta tighten like ""not this shit again"" and I politely excused myself, took the other employee aside and told them to leave him the fuck alone so he could eat"
"Such a great game! Reinstalled it 3 weeks ago and finished the career just yesterday actually. 

Absolutely loved it. The best compliment I can give it is that it feels like multiplayer game even in career. The AI is good at racing and they behave realistically with oversteer corrections, random mistakes and crashes. Oh yes the crashes, there's a lot of them and they are god damn spectacular. From second best after beam Ng damage model to tons of car debris and random junk such as tires and bits of fences flying around (what's cool is that they remain on track for the entire race, by the end the road is littered with stuff). I played on realistic damage and sometimes all 24 cars would retire by lap 2 of 12. In each race you fight against the opponents while trying not to wreck your car. 

As far as career mode goes it's very stringy, money is constantly barely enough and you have to both unlock and save up for the upgrades, which is nice imo. Sometimes you have to remove 'armor' parts from your car and be more vulnerable just to keep up with the rest of the pack."
