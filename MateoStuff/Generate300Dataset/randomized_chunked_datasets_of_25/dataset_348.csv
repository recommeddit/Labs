69997,"If you're going at the secondary level, don't major in education. Major in the subject matter you want to teach, and then apply to teaching school. Or better yet, apply to a school that combines these two.

My chem teacher worked construction, my algebra teacher did business, and my father who works in the district as an elementary school teacher did accounting.
