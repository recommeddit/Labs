69997,best major to study in college,"If you're going at the secondary level, don't major in education. Major in the subject matter you want to teach, and then apply to teaching school. Or better yet, apply to a school that combines these two. For example, my undergrad has a 5-year program where you get your bachelor's degree in your chosen subject area (such as English), as well as a teaching certificate, and spend a year student-teaching in an actual classroom. Also, I'd look to other subject areas - it will be very difficult to find a teaching job in those two subjects you mentioned, they are in very low demand."

70355,best major to study in college,"Tons of teachers in my district did something totally different and then switched to education for their masters, and I went to one of the best public school districts in the state. My chem teacher worked construction, my algebra teacher did business, and my father who works in the district as an elementary school teacher did accounting. I think they actually prefer teachers who did something different before, most students are not going to become teachers and having an adult that also went down that life path before switching is helpful."

66705,best soccer team in the world,">It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason.

Croatian diaspora is 1 million at best. So instead of 4.5 million there's 5.5 million to look at. Still less than 10% of the populations of Germany, England or France. Hardly misleading."

5885,best programming language for web development,"Did you happen to pick up any XML while you were learning Java? If so, learning HTML should be a breeze. From there, CSS and JS are good to know regardless if you want to do front end or back end. If you want to focus on back end, play around with PHP and then maybe install a framework like Laravel, or Ruby and then RoR."
67580,axios alternatives reddit,"Nothing is ‘wrong’ with continuing to use it currently. It’s now unmaintained though, so any changes to Node that break it, or any discovered vulnerabilities will never be fixed. Thinking about where to move is more of a long-term thought process - it’s not going to break overnight. 

There are also quite a lot of outstanding bugs with request that will now never get fixed. These may not impact your use-case, but they’re good to keep in mind."
