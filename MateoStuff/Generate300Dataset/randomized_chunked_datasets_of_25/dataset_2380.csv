30056,best money managing app,"I tried connecting BDO and BPI. A bit shady because it asks for your online banking credentials - but I don't expect local banks to be that advanced tech-wise. It says it only has read-only access to your bank account. I have transactions protected by OTP anyway so it's safe.

It synced all of my transactions and auto-categorized them! The auto-categorisation is not very accurate though, but they say it improves / learns with use, so it uses machine learning (?).

It categorised withdrawals as expenses at first though - should be transfers to cash.  


Edit: I messed up. I was talking about Spendee. ðŸ˜‚"
64738,Best Nike running shoes,"I have the same, i'm actually so worried about replacing them in case nothing ever fits as well as they do!"
12317,best gifts for mom,"As someone who crochets, I would warn against yarn gifts.  Usually they are difficult to find the right project for (I buy yarn for the project, I don't create a project to use up yarn), and therefore can sit around unused for years.  If you go that route, make sure they are returnable / exchangeable."
17439,best iOS game,"I was surprised by Void Tyrant. It definitely lacks enough incentive to replay after youâ€™ve won for me, but the game itself is solid... if you pay the greeady $3  IAP"
27495,best bollywood actor,Tbh I disagree. I donâ€™t even think Ranveer has gotten to the level of acting that prime Aamir and SRK did. Of course I still respect your opinion though. Which movies would you say he did a good job of method acting in?
70892,best movies with a cool twist,Cabin in the Woods!
36333,best alcoholic drink,And when you drink it every day people just think you're fancy.
12945,best gifts for mom,"well, yeah, but what are you going to buy her?"
67463,axios alternatives reddit,"I suppose...

""Fetch"" for anything other than a GET does kind of make my eye twitch a little... now that you mention it. I suppose if the endpoint always returns a response that helps lol!"
21505,best winnie the pooh comic,"I don't have much meta knowledge on Winnie the Pooh, although this still made me cry. I assume this is his son, who I know he got the idea from. In the slide where he was arguing with someone, was that A.A Milne? Was the son this mad about Winnie the Pooh in real life?"
31380,best country to live in,Hell yeah!
22799,best celebrity,"In a Q&A with a camera man I had, the camera man said Tommy Lee Jones was a nightmare to work with. He said he chewed out a different person everyday. Camera man noticed he did it right before he would perform so it was very tense and awkward for everyone. He theorized he literally could not act until he embarassed someone on set."

30020,best money managing app,"Convenience, especially when it comes to planning for long-term expenses (e.g., my annual car registration fee, new tires that I will need in 5 years, planning for a new phone in 4 years, etc) . I could set up a spreadsheet and figure out exactly how much I'm setting aside for those goals and how much I have saved for each of them, or I could pay a small amount for an app that will do it for me. I value my free time, so I choose the latter."

15914,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'm a bit of a camera/lens nerd, and I picked my glasses based on the brand the lenses.  I ended up picking [shwood](https://www.shwoodshop.com/) glasses, because they use Zeiss lenses, and are made in Portland Oregon, not by Luxotica.  As an added bonus the Canby Fifty Fifty with Polarized lenses is actually cheaper than similar Raybans with Polarized lenses.  I have no idea if it is psychosomatic, but I feel that things are much less distorted looking through these compaired to the pair of Prada glasses I replaced. Those Prada glasses aren't polarized and cost much more."
