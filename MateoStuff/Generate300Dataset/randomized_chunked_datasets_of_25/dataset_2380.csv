30056,"I tried connecting BDO and BPI. A bit shady because it asks for your online banking credentials - but I don't expect local banks to be that advanced tech-wise. It says it only has read-only access to your bank account. I have transactions protected by OTP anyway so it's safe.

It synced all of my transactions and auto-categorized them! The auto-categorisation is not very accurate though, but they say it improves / learns with use, so it uses machine learning (?).

It categorised withdrawals as expenses at first though - should be transfers to cash.

Usually they are difficult to find the right project for (I buy yarn for the project, I don't create a project to use up yarn), and therefore can sit around unused for years.

15914,"I'm a bit of a camera/lens nerd, and I picked my glasses based on the brand the lenses.  I ended up picking [shwood](https://www.shwoodshop.com/) glasses, because they use Zeiss lenses, and are made in Portland Oregon, not by Luxotica.  As an added bonus the Canby Fifty Fifty with Polarized lenses is actually cheaper than similar Raybans with Polarized lenses.  I have no idea if it is psychosomatic, but I feel that things are much less distorted looking through these compaired to the pair of Prada glasses I replaced. Those Prada glasses aren't polarized and cost much more.",best sunglasses for fashion
