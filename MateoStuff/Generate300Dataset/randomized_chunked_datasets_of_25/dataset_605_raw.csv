"I use Google Classroom (per our district's overall directive) to assign writing. Can students just plug in their writing and get the corrections, or do I have to assign and have them write in that program? I appreciate the suggestion, forgive me for asking questions instead of investigating myself. I have to crank through 35 more essays by end of today, arrgh!"
"Instead of ginger ale, try Ale81. I mean, if you're going Kentucky, why not go all the way?"
"Yea,I see what you mean. I think there was something odd about the 3 albums in terms of Sonic progressions but each album stands on each own"
"I would just like to note here that Brita claims that its pitcher filters reduce chlorine, copper, cadmium, and mercury (the latter three, Brita claims, lead to adverse health effects in the longer term). Meanwhile its faucet filters reduce lead, TTHM, VOCs, lindane (pesticide), 2,4-D, alachlor, atrazine (herbicide), chlorine, and sediment. You can view their user guide (linked below) regarding reduction claims for these substances, which have been certified by the Water Quality Association.

However, according to [Brita's user guide](http://www.brita.com/pdf/BritaUsersGuide.pdf), their filters are not meant to be used as a water purifier. That is to say, they do not purify the water you drink. They therefore recommend that any water ""that is microbiologically unsafe or of unknown quality"" be disinfected either prior to or after the use of a Brita filter, namely because Brita filters do not perform this function.

So you don't want to take your Brita filter to your nearby river and assume it's safe. However, with regard to treated tap water, Brita has been certified to reduce the aforementioned substances to the amount listed in their user guide, but as konzahiker notes, tap water is already quite safe, within the standards set by respective government agencies. So while you may be reducing those substances, unfiltered tap water is already safe to drink according to the standards set out by the EPA and others."
"As an employer and someone who is working on an online masters degree, I have a new appreciation of online degrees. I don't know about comparing it to a standard degree, but if I were to interview a candidate with an online degree I would at least ask them about the experience and not discount them for receiving an online degree."
"20/50 took care of most of the oil problems actually, man it loved that thick oil."
I couldn't agree more. The action presentation alongside D-Box made it so good. Mandarin is definitely the best character with his agressive style.
Only one of those is 21st century

"I just updated my original post showing all the below-500 coasters that are in each park. As a counterpoint to your argument, please take a look at Six Flags New England, Carowinds, Lagoon, and Morey's Piers on my list. The number of crap coasters in those parks is huge!"
"Well, there are a few keys to consider here:

\- The fact that we have faster computers doesn't mean that new software like electron isn't slow. It is slow compared to many alternatives

\- When I use VScode in a 3 screen setup and the other 2 screens have videos / anything GPU demanding, you can start seeing lag on the VScode, even when scrolling.

\- I use VScode as well, not ditching it, It's great, but the tech behind it it's not, however without that tech we would not have the number of plugins and customization that we do."
"Dude, I want that!"
"Well, either one would be suggested by me over the Xbox which features more mature oriented games.

The PS4 is amazing for it's catalog of exclusives and a general family oriented catalog as well.

However, I think the switch is the way to go. Nintendo is extremely good about being family friendly and with their access to 3rd party titles you'll get a plethora of adult games as well."
"Well, to be clear. I am a Python/Django developer. 

Several years ago I got a job as Django dev. 

3 weeks later they said they have no more job for Django dev and I should start learning React ASAP.

What a nice opportunity, I thought. 

So I learned plenty of things in a couple of weeks and was contributing to very complex parts of the app. There was a layers image editor with undo/redo, image transformations and so on. Of course Redux was the only thing back then.

It was so different from my python/backend that I am pretty sure some people in my state would go to rehab :D

But it was a lifetime ago.

Before that, thanks to Ionicframework I was exposed to Angular. So I built my SaaS frontend with Angular.

So I am seeking react tutorials for myself to refresh my knowledge of modern react. Plus need something for a complete beginner who just starting out as a frontend dev.

&#x200B;

Sorry if history-lesson-of-me took a while, but wanted to give some context. Thanks again, wish you a great week!"

I've been here twice since moving to SB. A few things that have put me off was the 45 min cooking time and the price.
"Mous Limitless 3.0, they seem to have been great for previous models and work well with the magnetic car mount and wireless chargers as well as providing good protection for a clumsy person like me."

Scrolled through this thread specifically looking for a Vanilla Sky recommendation. It's not on Netflix US but it is on Hulu. One of my all-time favorites.
