"I have tried a few but the best for me is the [clear Urban Armour Gear (UAG)](http://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-iPhone-Display/dp/B00LCAVRLS). For additional protection I also suggest the [Tech Armor Ballistic Screen Protector](http://www.amazon.com/Ballistic-Protector-Tech-Armor-Premium/dp/B00EL94RQE).

The UAG is stiff enough that I think it helps to reduce the chances of the iPhone getting bent. The UAG, especially the clear version, is not bulky but the lip is high enough to reduce the chances of damage to the screen when the phone is dropped accidentally. Word of caution though is you have to be careful when removing it as it is a tight fit."
"Better yet, clean the house without me even asking. While I sleep in. And wake up to fresh coffee made."
Happy Heart by Clinique. Itâ€™s bright and lightly floral. It ages well. So lovely.
"[OpenBudget](https://openbudget.us) might be a good fit. It's an envelope budget system that has a free tier. Nearly every feature is free, though it has a small subscription/one time fee for a few features"

"This is really cool, thanks for creating it! 

That being said, I really don't understand why people like The Hating Game. I read it after seeing it recommended so many places, and it was so bad I'm not even adding it to my Goodreads. 

Courtney Milan's Cyclone series on the other hand... Books usually end with me just sitting on my couch clutching a tea and bawling. They're just so human. Can't believe they didn't make the list!"
Warm greys and dark jewel tones.
"Check out Sunski glasses. They feel great, look great, are incredibly durable, and only cost $50. I would highly recommend them."
Nice! The GTD system is great. I hope you get a ton of benefits from it.
I like the idea of a dogwood but I'm a huge fan of Japanese maples - so beautiful.
As a mum I would love that.
I gave my mom ballet tickets.
"Out of my personal collection it would be Versace the dreamer, absolutely expensive smelling and is around 30â‚¬, and Hugo Boss man extreme, fantastic fresh clean but not at all boring and long lasting - also around 30â‚¬."
"Such an awesome post. I had the same thing happen but with a cat. 18 years together. He passed when my daughter was a few months old. Every child should have that bond with a pet, especially kids who have a hard time with friendships. He was my first best friend and my best."

"This is so true. My mum has been a dentist for like 30 years and she only ever uses samples of whatever toothpaste she's given. Whenever I see her she always asks if i want any toothpaste because she gets given so damn much.

I just asked her what she recommends and she said ""Anything with flouride, everything else is just bullshit companies are using to get you to buy it. Toothpaste is toothpaste"" Thanks mum :)"

"Man, if you can find it, I canâ€™t believe no one has said Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero."
"Yep, us Westerners.  We're more pure out here.

"T-Mobile was great for me until a few months ago. All of a sudden there was no reception at my house. I'm pretty sure they lost a nearby tower and didn't cop to it. I spent a month working with them to ""troubleshoot the problem"". Having that happen during covid was extra frustrating. We had to change providers."
"1. Spin by Robert Charles Wilson
2. We are Legion (We are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor
3. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams's

To be fair I have at least 10 favorite books on my top 3 list."
