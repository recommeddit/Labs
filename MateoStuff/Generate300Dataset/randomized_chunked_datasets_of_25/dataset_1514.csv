68502,best science fiction novel,I’m currently on Endymion and wanted to advocate for not stopping after Fall of Hyperion. Different characters but very much a continuation of the same larger storyline.
57930,best cologne,My girlfriend says cologne is for douchebags. Maybe that's an east coast thing?

69428,best major to study in college,"Let's put it this way. They're not going to hire you if you are incapable of doing the job. If they hire you, it's because they know you can do a decent job. However, you might have a leg up on the competition if you have personal connections with those in charge. Your resume is more likely to be seen, your glowing reviews from those you know will serve you well by placing you above other candidates, etc."

46681,best hand santizer brand,"I work with kids on the spectrum and for my clients, there is only one that can/will wear a mask for more than 5 minutes. Obviously the whole country is a mess right now and I shouldn't be surprised but there seems to be absolutely no consideration or planning being done here in the US (PNW) for kids with disabilities. If my clients didn't have the insurance or money to pay for extra services or respite care they would be completely screwed."
