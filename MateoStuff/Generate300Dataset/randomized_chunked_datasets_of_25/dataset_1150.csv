The extra projects only help once you want to get past that entry-level job. TBH though, internships are the most important rn because they get you close contacts at a company, and almost always lead to full-time offers. But you don't have to put in hours and hours into CS projects and EC's outside the classroom.",best major to study in college

Have you ever tried Profumum Roma's Inchusa? I prefer it to Philosykos... it's bitter with myrtle and doesn't rely on the cliched fig/coconut accord, more about the tree than the fruit. It's a really interesting and herbal take on fig. Judging by the overlap in our tastes, you might like it.",best perfume

29757,"Seconded. If you overspend a category in your budget, it doesn't break you, but it forces you to really consider what you're giving up in order to cover that overspending.

Personally, the category I overspend in the most is ""Dining Out"" (go figure). When I buy fast food, it makes me feel good for about the 15 minutes it takes to eat. When I go into my YNAB app and have to move the 10-12 dollars from somewhere to cover my overspending, I realize that I just had to take that money from my ""Rome Vacation"" fund to spend on the burger and fries that I could have avoided. It's alternately terrible and wonderful.",best money managing app

23211,"Perhaps it's a better idea to find something that has already built (open source) and customise it. It's going to be a little harder in the beginning to understand what's going on in the codebase but it'll be cheaper in the long term as you won't have to write it all from the scratch.

There are plenty of resources online.

69999,"For anyone interested in chemistry nonetheless: 

**Pro**: If you understand the concept, you don't have to memorise as many details as other majors. 

**Con**: Many of my courses had labs. *(I personally loved most of them especially inorganic chemistry since it was all pretty much playing with colours)*. However if you don't know what you're doing, you'll hate labs. You're basically standing for a couple hours following instructions and then you have to spend more hours in the week to write up the lab report. Plus all those chemicals in the room get to you pretty quick and you feel lightheaded soon into the lab time. 

In upper years though, you get to design your own experiments and research and that can be either fun or not depending on whether you're there just to get marks or are actually testing something fun. (A friend of mine is growing fruit fly embryo with cancer and then using one of our other professor's anti-cancer drug to treat it. Cool, no?) 

**Pro**: There are a variety of fields you can choose to specialise in in chemistry - inorganic, organic, biological, analytical, medicinal, thermodynamics, etc so you're likely to find something you both like and are good at. 

**Con**: Most of the opportunities to get experience are boring. On campus, I can help out in labs and as an undergrad that basically means I'm washing your pipettes and stuff and helping to set up materials for other people's labs. If you're smart and cool with a prof you can ask to help out in their research lab. Even then most of the time you'll be doing the stuff that the grad students don't want to do (running titrations, chromatography, preparing the instruments etc) 

**Pro**: Whenever you tell people you're studying chemistry you instantly gain their respect. You also gain superiority over biologists (even though I personally feel biology is a much harder field because of all the memorising). 

**Con**: If you can't understand concepts easily, you won't do well no matter how well you memorise everything. This really gets some people because they grow up with the mentality ""if you don't get it, memorise it"" to ace tests. Here you'll fail even if you memorise the textbook inside out. Side note: uni tip - if you're going to memorise anything, memorise the past tests. Most profs repeat questions

**Pro**: You can pretty much do anything (science related) with chemistry. With chem you can go into environmental, industrial, food, pharmaceutical, med school, nuclear chem, forensics, etc  *Physics is even more general! Biology is the one that's the most restricted imo. But that's just me building a hierarchy of the sciences.*

**Con**: Your uni schedule will be a mess. At least here at my uni this is the case because most of the chemistry courses have labs. You'll have to fit them in on top of  all your other lectures and tutorials 

Source: I'm specialising in chemistry, it's the funnest subject out there tbh. I'm going in my fourth year of a chemistry specialist and environmental science major at the university of Toronto. So this is mainly concerning uni life in that field not as much as life after uni.

27226,"Because as a supply chain they've been killing the whole omnichannel(brick and mortar/online/delivery) sales and marketing model. My take is it'll eventually trump convenience for customers who would like a choice between picking up on the same day(a la brick and mortar store), or waiting for 1 or 2 day delivery (Amazon) and find a large market niche in there. Interesting to see how Amazon and Walmart would play catch-up given the capital they have at their disposal alongside the advantage of the whole walled garden advantage Amazon has with Prime and Alexa stuff. 

Target to me is a good buy likely to have high returns in coming years with current management helping the company gain a bigger piece of the pie in market segment share(currently poised like AMD in 2017/2018 if I remember the timeline with Lisa Su taking over right) but seems to have a lot of external threats which depend on competitor moves making it risky to buy without diversifying into Walmart, Amazon and Albertsons (and maybe Kroger???). Also unlike how AMD panned out, their market is currently limited to the US, has a lot of fragmented competition and is still only growing share limiting how much more they make out in time.",best stocks to buy
