"My god I love my Lunarlons! They aren't extremely light, but are durable and comfortable."
"MSRP wise this would be $70-$80 i feel for other games with similar component contents. Terraforming Mars, Descent JotD, and Spirit island are all in 70-80 SRPs.  Maybe the miniatures or the extra plastic increase costs highly.

Dominion is $45 and that is like if Jaws of the Lion was nothing but cards."
LOVE FTL and it breaks my heart I can’t play it on my phone.

"I binged the Crash Course History channel for a while there, great breakdown of the human past"
Sounds like Nicholas Cage
"Bradford pear trees require regular pruning every few years or they are prone to split. They are not native, and they bastardize native pear trees for miles around. If OP wants a small shade tree without a mess, dogwoods, serviceberries, and redbuds are great options with a variety of leaf and blossom color. The root systems of these won’t cause problems with the lawn or foundation as they age."
"It’s “Amusement” parks not “Theme” parks. Although, Knott’s kinda feels like it’s more of a theme park"
"Yes, but this is the internet and especially on Youtube so many statements are made out of context. Steve was probably tired of reading this. 

Maybe you always inferred the context in which the statement was true and that's why you don't recall seeing it or you never read many comments outside of more enthusiast oriented sites."
"Down the Rabbit Hole is the ultimate binge channel, I can never watch just one episode a time.

For those not in the know, it's a documentary channel largely focused on internet history and drama."
Indy 5 comes out in 2 years :)
"And to clarify for OP or someone that may not know, a typical clothes dryer uses a 220v outlet."

"Copy + paste into word and compare. What one misses, the other will pick up. Granted, at this level ... just learn the grammar tools behind the mistakes if it’s over correcting, and then make the correction yourself."
"Probably Sword or Shield.  The old games from gameboy are really solid though and I think you can get them from E-store.  Pokemon Silver was my first and favorite, probably my favorite just from all the nostalgia and how special it was to me when I was younger though.  Old games hold up well though if you get into it enough that you want to try a lot of the games.  The original Red and Blue are good but I feel like in Silver and Gold they worked out a lot of the kinks and the game is longer."
I love Fred Warner. His SB mic'd up was fun to listen to.
seems like there a some recent commit this year
">tank factory that was producing tanks that would go down the block and fight as soon as they were done

I did this last night, to the Protoss"
"Does it support external download managers like IDM, ADM ?"
"$300-500

That's where HD600 is :P"

"As of right now, I'd say Edge."
"yo, american citizen here, lived in Thailand for 8 years, worked with lots of hotels, resorts, restaurants, etc there. also a lot of wedding catering etc.

So the thing I'd look for, in your situation, is an 'expat forum'.  for example, Thaliand has the site ""Thaivisa"" (among others) where a large number of English-speaking expatriates congregate online, and they generally have specific areas for specific regions of a country- with people asking where to get a cheap good booking on a hotel, where to get a good american burger or some real italian pasta, and where to find great spots to hang out (tour destinations, restaurants, nice bars, events, etc).

So it depends on where you're going. but if you want to go there, odds are somebody like you wanted to live there before you had the idea, and they'll probably have an internet connection- so find them and ask."
"Sure, feel free to send me updates."
