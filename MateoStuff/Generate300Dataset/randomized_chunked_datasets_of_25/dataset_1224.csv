55415,best action and adventure novel series,"Heart of Darkness.

More of a philosophic adventure, but they do go through colonial Africa on a boat which is pretty neat to me. However, it has very dense prose which subjects from the action a bit."

I linked to Home Depot because a quick google search showed they had the lowest price.

If you can find an old Sears Coldspot freezer, it'd be worth looking into.  I bought one in 2005 that was made in the late 60's and its still running strong.  Sears Coldspot freezers became Kenmore around 1977.

Edit to add:  I live just south of Memphis, TN and the freezer stays in my garage so its seen the heat and humidity of the South all its life and is still kicking."
