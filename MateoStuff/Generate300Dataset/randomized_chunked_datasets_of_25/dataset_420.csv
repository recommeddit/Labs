5749,best programming language for web development,"I'd leave out Python. Not because I don't like it but because you can replace it by any other arbitrary language. Could be Ruby for example but it's not essential language to know. I think for being employable HTML/CSS/JS works good with PHP/MySQL for server side. You can then, of course, dive into Python and Django, Ruby and Rails, or other hot frameworks based on JS like Node and so on."

24973,best spiderman actor,"Garfield was the best, he just was given bad writing to work with. He captured current Spider-Man comics the best. Tom is a good young Spider-Man, similar to Ultimate but less bitter and pissed off. Tobey had a cool costume and was the first so he'll always be special to us all, and I think that's something people need to recognize about him. Too many people have their nostalgia goggles on with him and start to remember the comics character differently whenever they suggest he was the most accurate."

52115,best iphone case,"I too have this Incipio case for my 6 Plus and am very happy with it. It's sturdy but doesn't add too much heft or size. It's also unassuming, which I like. I found it based on a winning review from The Wirecutter: http://m.thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-iphone-6-case/"

62819,Best Data Science textbook,"I know this is technically slightly out of the DS scope, but was wondering what your thoughts are on ""Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are."" (quite the mouthful). Again, technically this would be Big Data books, but it really opened up the door for me to the world of data. I personally enjoyed it, thought it was a good intro to the topic for a 'beginner' so to say. But data scientists, lmk if this you think it was a good/bad book!"
17127,best iOS game,"Don't be fooled tho. Asian rhythm games end up being quite expensive if you want to expand your library, but for people who enjoy rhythm games, the DLC is totally worth it for the most part. 

Anyways, for 2 bucks, Cytus 2 has a bunch of content that you can unlock by playing."

55391,best action and adventure novel series,"Urban fantasy tends to be really good about found families since the relationships have time to grow over many books.

Some of my favourites in that genre in that regard are:


**Innkeeper series by Ilona Andrews**: The central setting is an intergalactic magical bed & breakfast in Texas that hosts aliens visiting Earth. There's the Innkeeper Dina, her resident guest who is a former galactic tyrant, a cute monstrous dog, a neighbor werewolf who pisses on Dina's apple trees but turns out to be a nice guy, recurring space vampire guests etc. And in book 2 when the inn hosts peace negotiations between three warring alien species, the inn gets a wonderful new chef. There is a slow burn romance.

This series is my all time favourite comfort read. Although fair warning, book 2 always makes me cry. But they're very cathartic tears. These books also make me laugh out loud. I gifted the books to a friend and she said the same. Ilona Andrews writes awesome action and banter.

You can totally read just book 1 and not read on if you don't feel like it. These books are also a bit shorter than your average 90K urban fantasy books.

**InCryptid series by Seanan McGuire**. A family of cryptozoologists researches and tries to protect magical critters from monster hunters. There are three siblings and each gets at least 2 books of their own, then we shift the point of view character.

We see many generations of family and their wisdom is shared in chapter epigraphs as quotes. There are also the wonderful speaking Aeslin mice that worship the family members and remember their deeds as their holy liturgy.

You could easily read just the first book and leave off with it since the story of that book has a good ending.

**October Daye by Seanan McGuire**: A half-fae PI has lost her mortal family due to magical shenanigans and needs to find her place in the treacherous Fae world. Toby gathers a wonderful found family around her. There's a mentor, scary mentor, eventually a squire, eventually a found sister (and her real family who are peaces of work. Ugh), a love interest and many, many friends.

I suppose you could stop reading after book 1 but this series pays off the most as a series."
