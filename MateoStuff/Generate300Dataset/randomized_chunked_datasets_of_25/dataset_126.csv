71246,best movies with a cool twist,"I think that was part of the appeal. At the time of theatrical release everybody was talking about how no one saw it coming.
Except for some asshats who claimed they knew all along."
278,best terminal file manager reddit,Ncdu rocks

34228,best NFL player,Brady has been the better QB the last several years if you average them out. No QB in the NFL gets more out of that sad husk of a supporting cast that was the 2019 Patriots offense. Football isnt baseball either. Numbers can't tell you as much in this sport.
56263,best action and adventure movie,Spirited Away.
24611,best anime,"Ok, check out Vinland Saga, Black Lagoon, Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans, and Erased."

34047,best Pokemon game,X/Y are my favorite of the 3ds line! S/M and US/UM are good games too but you need to be very prepared for long dialogue. X/Y are beautiful first take into the 3ds Pokemon worlds.

4382,best text editor,"Yeah, I've been down this road too. Jetbrains feels very, I dunno, managed? Like it feels like someone thought of it before I got there and had a solution ready every time. Very little cobbling together."
73192,best Linux distro,"This depends entirely on the internet computer you will use. Will you be using a direct hardline (Cat 5/6 cable) to connect to the internet, or will you be using wireless? You can get lucky most times with wireless on Linux, but Linux works with a hardline every time. I'm not sure which distro works best for any kind of wireless.

In any case, I recommend Ubuntu if only because there is so much online help available with Ubuntu. (I use Mint, and a lot of Ubuntu help works on Mint, because Mint is a derivative of Ubuntu.)

30407,best Mexican war to study,"No worries.  For further reading on the Barbary Wars, I suggest picking up a copy of Six Frigates.  It details the beginning years of the U.S. Navy from the 1780's through The War of 1812.  It's a very well researched book and I highly recommend it."
28228,best breakfast foods,"This is my weekend breakfast, and if I have any some crispy pancetta on top. Lovely glass of cold orange juice and I'm set up for the day."
