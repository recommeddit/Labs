"Nope. Some sections were intriguing, but overall I did not like it. I should have quit half way through, but I got caught in the literary equivalent of the sunk cost fallacy and forced myself to finish it. I thought that even though it's one book in a series, it would end with some closure and I would just stop there. Boy was I wrong. The ending had no closure and I felt like I was being jerked around to pick up the next book. If not for that, I would have felt neutral about the book instead of scammed and disgusted."
"**sushi go**

* Simple drafting game. Accessible theme and lots of fun. This is my wife's favorite game. 

**An abstract game**

* Santorini, Element, or Onitama. In that order. Just get one. Abstracts can be a ton of fun and those three are a great time.

**Splendor**

* Accessible tabloe builder. You are a merchant buying and selling gems. Become the best merchant you can be. It's simple, fun, and has depth.

**Co-op game**

* Theme matters a bit here. So does difficulty. The Captain is Dead is a great co-op if you want a sliding scale of difficulty and a space theme. Dead of Winter is a great co-op with a zombie theme. The Grizzled is fun but it can be a bear (and luck based). It does have a cool WW1 theme though. Hanabi is a great theme too. Fire works and such. Feels like a co-op. I guess it is? Pandemic will get brought up in this category. If you're playing with all new people, this will be fun. If you're playing with older gamers, they might be sick of pandemic (and there are so many versions to choose from).

**king of tokyo**

* It's a great dice game and an excellent light game. Psuedo Yahtzee meets single area control. What's not to love?

**Potion Explosion**

* If you liked games such as bejeweled or Candy crush, this is the board game version. And it is solid gold. Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it.

**Lords of Waterdeep**

* This is a solid worker placement game. You really can't go wrong. The only other worker placement game I would recommend is Champions of Midgard. 

**Small World**

* Truth be told, I hate this game. But I am the only person I know who dislikes the game. Mix and match all different lores, use that mix to control enough of an area to score points. 

**For Sale**

* What Monopoly distilled is. And it is fun. Auction mechanics. Bid on a property. Resell the property for a higher value.

**Resource management game**

* Most people think of Catan when this is brought up. I would like to suggest Abyss. I never really liked Catan and my friends always loved it. So I was over joyed when my friends loved Abyss. You are trying to win enough votes to become king of the depths. You get votes of various water people ( the resource cards). Then you use the votes to buy senators (points cards with special abilities). The senators help you secure sections of the depths (give you more points). It's simple to learn. It's fun. And there is always a counter strategy. Only caveat. I would not play this at 2 players. It's too easy to get ahead and stay ahead."

"He's openly come out and said something to the effect of nobody seems to come out and see his movies when once in awhile, he takes on a serious role.  Then everyone does and he gets paid when its him and his friends in sillier movies

And like.  Who can disagree with him.  May as well milk it as long as there's a demand"
"Backseat Freestyle.  Damn that song is so dope.  And the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZW7et3tPuQ), oh man Sherane work it!"
"Seriously.  Even during the 2016 election he was pleading caution due to the number of undecided voters and the amount of uncertainty compared to 2012.  I just get the impression that OP hasn't actually read this book, as the content itself refutes everything he's saying."
Especially when taken in context with Asimov's robot/foundation novels.
"I use an [API test kit](http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?id=580#.WPw5W4iGOUk) for my aquariums, and you could use them just on your tap water as well. It comes with little dropper bottles to test for a few different things (chlorine, pH levels, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate).

About $70 here in Australia, but I think in the US it's much cheaper, maybe $20-30."
"Sedona, AZ.  Beautiful red rocks, classy bars,  and some great southwestern art boutiques.  Best part of the trip by far was riding horseback through the canyon.  

During the horseback ride, the place got a derpy photo of me riding the horse through a small creek. My eyes were closed, mouth was open, and I looked really stupid. They had the audacity to try to sell me the photo. I offered them money to destroy it forever."
"Professors are often called ""Doctor"" because they have an advanced degree. The only doctor on the Atreides house, that I know of, is that Traitor. 

u/ProfessorAtriedes is Doctor Yueh, confirmed."
"If someone has tried with their costume, I don't care if they are 28, they can have candy.

If someone has half-assed or no-assed it it and looks 15 or older... I believe I shall require some form of entertainment to dispense candy."
"He works as a translator in the military. Every time he posts he's in a new, more awesome location."
"A night in a hotel. Honestly. Maybe you can schedule it when you can get some help with the baby. But book the room, schedule a 3 pm or so check in, maybe give her books, magazines, movies, snacks, whatever she likes, and let her have a night to sleep, soak in the bath, watch tv, and just relax.

Alternately, if she would have a hard time leaving the baby, I'd suggest  something she'd never get for herself like a beautiful winter coat."
"Hello, and thank you for your comment. Unfortunately, it has been removed. Please note the following from our [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules):

**Rule 3 : No piracy or grey-market software keys**

> No piracy or so-called ""grey-market"" software keys. This is includes suggesting, hinting, or in any way implying to someone that piracy or the use of these licenses is an option. If a key is  abnormally cheap (think $10-30), it is probably one of these, and is forbidden on /r/buildapc.



Thank you.

"No doubt they will be remembered more fondly just because they have achieved success recently. Nobody is doubting that.

But that wasn't the question was it?"

"**Swedish Fish**

Swedish Fish is a fish-shaped, chewy candy originally developed by Swedish candy producer Malaco in the late 1950s for the U.S. market. The wrapper calls them ""a fat free food"" and they are marketed in different colors and flavors.

Same for my 4 man party. We tend to play most games a bit slower but it's fine since we're having a good time.
"I would be interested in seeing this stratified with colleges. That is, does an English major from a top-tier school (Ivies, flagship publics like UNC, UM, UW etc.) face the same terrible prospects as one from a lesser-known and less competitive school? Recruitment and internships for all majors occurs pretty regularly for all majors at my university, and all of my graduating friends over the past few years have found jobs."
"Have you checked out Westworld? Christopher Nolan's brother directs it and it is an absolutely mindfuck of a show. Makes you question the nature of your reality. Take in all the details and try to follow along the best you can lol.

Black Mirror is another great psy-fi show. That I couldn't recommend more. White Christmas is a mindfucker. Hang The DJ is another that stands out in memory."
"I'm a ramp agent working with baggage every day, travel film is awful.

There are 2 of us in the baggage hold, one to pass from the door to the end and one to stack. On bigger planes it is quite a distance and you can have 200 22kg bags to load. A lot of bags have 4 wheels now and are super easy to roll down, they always get the lightest treatment. Hard shell cases are better than soft shell as they provide better frame for handling and stacking. Then you have the travel film that stops the bag sliding and the only option to to fucking launch it down like you're doing shot put at the Olympics.

Seriously, a hard shell suitcase with 4 wheels will prevent a lot of potential damage.

NO FILM"
"I recently needed some higher-drop shoes and after trying on half the store I settled on a pair of Nikes (the lunar tempo 2). They've been great, I'm very happy with them."

Dolphins plugins are pretty handy.
"Eat a lemon, including the skin, but not the seeds. It sucks at first but every time I start to get sick I eat one or two, get a good nights sleep and the next day it feels like you're on the tail end of the sickness, or completely better."
