"According to the comments above, it is to spec. Given that, I can't complain other than to note my own failure to read and/or understand the original spec."
I like you
Is possible wiki was wrong or I read it wrong * shrug * still not worth the hassle of another password haha.

"Lol. Unfortunately, I can remember that experience and I wish my mind was erased of that trauma"
"Vim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text can pretty much all do what VS Code can do if you want them to. Atom and Sublime are pretty close ootb?"
"You're right, wasn't thinking. Couldn't figure out how to add spoiler tags, so I just deleted it."
It's not particularly important but it's neat to know the article you linked is exactly a year old today.
">It may only come out every 2 weeks

that's because there isn't a whole papers worth of news every day."
Thats not the way of calculators. Most quantitative professionals use scientific calculators every day.
"Must own is so hard to say for other players since it's personal, but like others have said, it should be something that you love and can play regularly. 

In my case, I don't have the time to play long games, I own and love **Eclipse**, but it's probably leaving the collection because I only play once a year or so. 

For me personally, my collection would be incomplete if I didn't also own **Carcassonne**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Ticket to Ride**, and **Diamonds**

If you play 2 player head to head games I'd recommend **Jaipur**

If you have parties, I also consider **Time's Up: Title Recall** and **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** to be essential."
"For query strings, everyone should use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams. Unfortunately it was introduced late in the life of JS and so it has a million non-native competitors."
Right?? But also ‚Äî HOW could you forget?! Haha! üòâ

"If you don‚Äôt buy directly from glorious, make sure it‚Äôs the newer batch. They come with a much better cable."
Show us your knockers!
Nothing wrong with some bad decision juice
"Usually I start out with niche \(lol\), just to get some overall insight into a college I've found. They have some nice lists you can spin off from, and it's a really great tool for college explorations. You don't want to depend on any single site for all your info though. The reviews are pretty good too\- usually I'll start with the one stars and work my way up on different aspects. 

It's a little off the side, but I also like going on college admissions/specific college discords and just hitting ctrl\-f for certain keywords to see what other people think about certain colleges or majors. You'll get more thoughtful and research insights you won't be able to find online, although on chats like those you do want to take everything in with a grain of salt.

It's also easier to ask questions and get into contact with people at a certain college."
"My dentist recommended flossing first, then brushing. She said that the floss loosens up gunk which your toothbrush then removes."
"Once RMC Gwazi opens, I think BGT and SWO will have one of the best coaster collections in the world between them.  They're only an hour away from each other so it's entirely possible to do all of them in one day with time to spare.  Separately though, I think BGT will be top 5 but definitely not #1."
"Coming from a ‚Äúfoodie‚Äù city, gotta say, the food here has been disappointing but here is my list:

Pizza: Bettina in Montecito;
Loquita;
Zaytoon for ambience‚Äîfood is ok;
Carusos for fine dining with great ambience;
Tacos: east beach;
Merci montecito ‚Äîbest chocolate chip cookie in town, good sides to go sit and eat outside;
Breakfast: field and fort in summerland, bree osh, handlebar coffee;
Coffee: handlebar, low pigeon or dune


Have yet to find a thai restaurant that has flavor. Any recs?"
It's also great for removing troublesome blood stains
"Only bummer is that you can't reconcile accounts, but that's not that huge of a deal."
My experience was like this as well. The first few days I thought it was going to vibrate the teeth right out of my skull. Since then it's been awesome. Just wish replacement heads weren't so expensive.
