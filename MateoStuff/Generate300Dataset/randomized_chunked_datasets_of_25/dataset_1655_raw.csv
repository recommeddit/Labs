"Ceiling - Sherwin Williams Eminence. 

Walls - we had excellent results with both SW Duration Matte and Emerald Satin. For color you’re going to have to choose your own. Our new house is getting SW Snowfall flat (which is a very light grey). I would recommend against a plain old white and get something with some pigment. But beware of any silvers/greys that have a hint of blue - they all ended up looking way more blue on the wall than we expected - looking at you, SW Silver Strand! It looks like a light blue in our family room!"
"I agree, but that's not usually the point people make with these discussions. With glasses it can be especially finicky and contentious because Ray Bans are super expensive now under Luxotica, but back in the day we're gas station sunglasses."
"Agreed. Not to disparage this list - these are incredible books. However, the industry as a whole really needs to pay more attention to F/F romances."
"Hmmm this will be difficult. I might have to do this based purely on number of times I have reread a book. In no particular order:

1.  The Duchess Deal by Tessa Dare (audiobook)

2.  Sustained by Emma Chase

3. What Happens in London by Julia Quinn

4.  Pairing Off by Elizabeth Harmon

5.  Misadventures with a Professor by Sierra Simone"
"A friend of mine has a story about him. She used to live in Santa Monica and had gone to the store with her kids in her eco-friendly minivan. As she is walking out to her car she sees some dude scoping out her car. As she gets closer she realizes who it is. He asks her what kind of gas mileage she got and her response was ""do you know who you are?!"". He laughed and responded with ""yes, I do."" He wanted to buy the same vehicle for a relative."

"Wait for imminent market correction 
PLTR could be this era’s MSFT
Creative destruction will define 5 year window
Sector dominate AAPL, COST, AMZN, GOOGL
TSLA if you’re risk tolerant. 
Curious about AMBA. Low trading volume. Last 3 weeks similar to AMD run
BTC, ETH if considering crypto"

"The vast majority of my ""file management"" is just using shell commands (`mv`, `cp`, `ls`, `rsync`, `find`, `cat`, `display`/`feh`, etc), so the only time I usually turn to a ""file manager"" is when I have disjoint files that I want to operate on *en masse*, but can't easily find a glob to pinpoint them. Usually media where I want to operate on particular files (they're all named, e.g., ""IMG_####.JPG"", but I want the ones of my parents; or a whole folder of podcasts and I want to delete the ones that don't sound interesting). For these particular use-cases, I'll use either `ranger`, `nnn`, or `lynx` in dired mode. I tinkered a bit with `mc` but it didn't fit my brain, and even though I'm a `vi` guy, I didn't find that `vifm` was what I was looking for either.   Fortunately, you can try them all and see what works for you."
Oh! How big is your home office by the way?
"If you feel a sore throat coming on, mouthwash is actually a great way to keep it from advancing and to keep you from getting a cold. Salt water also works well."
Well said.
"You can go as crazy as you want, but do not lose sight of what you have purchased. It is a sketchbook. It is nothing other than a sketchbook and you should be able to feel free to sketch with whatever the hell you want. Use your kid brother's crayons if you feel like it. Pencils. Bic pens. The burnt tortilla that fell off your plate. There is nothing written anywhere that you need to go buy something special to draw on a sketchbook and I am willing to bet you will have more fun experimenting than buying yourself a set of pens and locking yourself down to it. Have fun man...or woman...whatever you are."
Jomashop generally has Ray Bans on the upper end of your range. I got polarized ones from there for $100
Lol amazing. Stone Cold always seemed like the talkative type.

Couple hours from DC?  Hershey or Kings Dominion would be the best.  I prefer Hershey but I haven't been to KD in a while.
Is false 9 Van de Beek possible? He was the de facto striker for 18-19 ajax run
"Zero has a slight edge in control while otsu has more speed. Otsu is also a little more comfortable IMO.

Durability for the otsu v1 was an issue, but myself and other otsu v2 owners seem to agree that they must've fixed it because I have no issues."
"Bass. I started on bass and have never regretted it. Get good at it, and you'll always be able to find bandmates.

You'll learn to lock onto a groove, and the power of the [ostinato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato) -- a little-used term which will serve you well on other instruments. (The ultimate ostinato is arguably the bass line to *Taxman* by the Beatles.)

Edit: I see that the Wikipedia article I linked chooses *Day Tripper* as an example, but not *Taxman*. Pooh."
"1. Ray-Ban (as the other person mentioned, they are the OG and some of the old B&L lenses are still amazing)

2. Cazal (when it comes to design Cari knocks almost anyone out of the park)

3. Cartier (opulence and the most iconic dictator sunnies in the Vendome, what is there not to like)"
