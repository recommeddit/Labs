"I'm so curious to know if this thing could fly (though I imagine not,). 

Looking for something that can charge a MacBook a couple times over."
An ivy league biology degree was worth as much for me as a roll of paper towels. So not biology.
"Yeah, the minimum wage where I live is 300-325 USD a year, so they have to keep the prices somewhat cheap to be able to sell their products."
Most immediate fun? Voice or drums. After years of practice? Guitar or piano
"If you like cookies and cream, Ben n Jerry's ""milk and cookies"" flavor is an absolute must try. I didn't think cookies and cream could get any better, and this flavor proved me wrong.

Sucks though, because it doesn't come in a size any larger than a pint, afaik."
Definitely. Which is why it is far and away my favorite Nolan film. No disrespect to Dark Knight or Momento but they just aren't on that same level.
"And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be?"
"Oh I know, they have been jonesing hard on Arctic Monkeys ever since their debut album.  And it appears that it will not slow down any time soon.

Despite NME's review, I quite like ""AM,"" and it has gotten me more interested in the band, but I do not think they are the second coming for rock music."
Nixon wasn't a people person
"Hey, that's what I have! :D or D:?"
"Is there a link to a study or anything of that sort to support this?

TL;DR - Citation Please."
"Sea salt caramel. 

No words to describe. Just. Pure. Heaven."
"I was in your shoes then I decided to give intellij a shot for a couple weeks just to try something new.  Never even thought about switching back. Even a year later I'm still discovering awesome new things it can do for me. 

Also I feel bad saying this but now I kind of judge my coworkers who use atom and sublime. Like *you have no idea what you're missing.*"
I’ll try my best I’m pretty maxed out already
"Haha! Never tried green tea, but I can figure out what it tasted like with your description! 

I don’t know Swiss orange, but orange and chocolate together is good, so that must be good aswell.

We had a orange ice cream here in Canada when I was younger. It was very good. Tried once to do an orange ice cream. Didn’t taste enough to my taste"
"The Anker Power bank, I think it's the 20000 mAh, charges a phone and a tablet multiple times no problem, takes a while to charge though"
Xodo is awesome. I use it at work. It's really powerful for a free app.
"The MCU doesn't deserve Tom Holland, he's putting all of his heart and effort for the character but all of it goes to waste with the shittiest scripts of any Spider-Man movie, so, I think I'll go with Tobey in this one"
I still don’t see Brady edging out Rodgers’ numbers the last few years.
A lot of that depends on the attention span of the child as well as individual interests.  Finding the right theme is really helpful as well.  What is your kid interested in?
Awesome to see my home on Reddit. I live 8 miles from the heart of the Adirondacks in the town of Saranac lake. Currently working on my 46er. I have 23 under my belt. Great picture!
Think i’m gunna rock this one nakeddd

"Well tbh you're a dream patient. Flossing and mouthwash are so helpful for preventing from dental diseases since most of them are caused by poor hygiene. Genetics of course matter in this case but I can assure you if you won't care to your teeth things will not be good for them. Genetics means you have to be more careful than most people which you are doing as far as you say.
So keep flossing and mouthwashing my friend"
