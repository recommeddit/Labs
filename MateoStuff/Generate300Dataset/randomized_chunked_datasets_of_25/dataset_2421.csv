Cheetah Hunt at BGT probably has the best scenery and landscaping value of all the ~100 roller coasters I have ever been on. Big Bad Wolf at BGW was thrilling due to the trees, especially in the autumn. Scream however...",best roller coaster at six flags

Charlie Kaufman films should also interest you. Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind, Synecdoche New York and Anomalisa at least.

Some other movies that should interest you: The Usual Suspects, Seven, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Open You Eyes (or the remake: Vanilla Sky), L'Appartement (or the remake: Wicker Park).",movies like Inception

16625,">Also you seem very nonchalant about the prospect of your cat dying. I'm not sure ""our cat just died let's immediately get a new pet"" is the right attitude to have. 

Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed it came off that way. I do believe my cat will come back. I'm 99% sure she's alive. I don't *know* she's alive, but I'm sure she is. My daughter just associated that street with danger and made her own conclusion. It just made me wonder what would happen if I'm wrong. We wouldn't get another pet right off the bat. We would take time to research recommended pets and try to get one that gets along with my daughter. My inquiry was just general curiosity should it actually happen.

>I think a fish would be appropriate.  

She's very affectionate and would want something to hold and cuddle.",best pet for toddlers
36862,"As others have said, Dark Knight is really the only thing you can skip without feeling like you missed out on something. I guess you could throw skull mountain in that category as well. Also, if you’ve been to any other six flags parks, you’ve been to other six flags parks, odds are you’ve probably ridden a clone of the Batman invert (and possible Superman flying coaster) so I guess you could skip them too if you’ve ridden them before.",best roller coaster at six flags
