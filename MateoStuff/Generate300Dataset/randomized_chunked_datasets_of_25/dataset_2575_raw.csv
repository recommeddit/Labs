"I think you might be me, except I'm a girl.  I do buy my partner saxx so our lists really line up.  Also RFD for the win."
Deno looks like it will be the cure to all JS ills... When v1 comes out I am going to drink a very special beer :)
"Theres a filter called zero water that claims to remove ALL dissolved solids from water. The water tastes cleaner, but I'd like to know if its actually doing what it says"
"A reminder: risking your $1000+ device by betting on the integrity of a $2 cable of questionable origin and certification, is how you brick your $1000+ device. 

Don’t fuck around with questionable active cables. Best case scenario you brick your device. Worst case scenario, you burn your house down.

Ask yourself if an extra $17 (to get a reputable MFi certified cable) is worth preventing one of those two outcomes."

I guess we'll have to wait and see. Tesla cars have held their value better than all of their competition."

"The game that’s on game pass is asseto corsa. It is a simulator with good selection of cars and tracks. It’s good on Xbox but it is best played on pc with all the mods and add one, assetto corsa is a different game on pc. Try it since it is on game pass but don’t expect too much. 

Assetto corsa competizione is a official SRO Org licensed game which focuses on GT3 racing. All cars with base game are GT3 class cars and there is dlc for GT4(slower) cars. It is mainly for sprint and endurance racing if you are into it. It looks better than ac(built on UE) has better UI and has became the king of GT3 racing game for console. But it is just GT3 and GT4(dlc) racing. 
 
I do a lot of sim racing and have a good sim rig setup and acc has been a really good racing sim."

"Some Alaskan hotels have a cheap monthly ""winter rate"" as tourism in the winter(October-April) slows down quite a bit.


Usually like $750-$1,000, and that's everything included."
"This is my approach. 


1. After I write something, I use the read aloud functions in Windows Word, or the really great read aloud function on Apple. Hearing the sentence helps me fix it. 


2. I paste the copy on the [hemingwayapp.com]. (http://hemingwayapp.com/) This is not a grammar checker. It flags sentences that are complicated. It prompts you to rewrite a sentence. To simplify it.  This might solve some of your problems. They also have a version that downloads as a win/apple desktop."
But I think they are better than Purdue though right? They have a much lower acceptance rate...
"I'd recommend a lot of Games Workshop's _Warhammer 40,000_ books. Maybe check the _[Space Marine Battles](http://www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/Space-Marine-Battles)_ series."

It has more cores and threads than 5600x and will last you longer in the future. It’s called being more future proof. It is usually on sale while the 5600x usually isn’t . A good price for 5800x is $370 or under. A b550 is a great midrange motherboard than will ensure you get all the performance you can out of your cpu and gpu.

Battle Chasers is a VERY underrated Turn-based RPG. I would highly recommend you look into it when you can. I dumped at least 110 hrs into it.

"The instant Egg McMuffin with Canadian bacon. 

Take a bowl the size of an English muffin and scramble an egg in it. add salt and pepper. Put a slice of Canadian bacon on top and microwave for a bit. Toast an English muffin at the same time. Flip the egg/Can. bacon over in the dish and microwave to finish. 

Butter the muffin, add a slice of cheese, put the egg/bacon combo in there and stuff your face with it. It only takes a few minutes to make.

NOTE: You can add veggie type granola shit to the egg if that's your thing."
