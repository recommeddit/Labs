72621,best wireless lightweight mouse,I love the m4 but the aggressive curve makes the bottom of my thumb hurt even after 2 weeks of us. My aim is v good with it. When I went back to ec1 the pain went away instantly.
15256,best tree for the garden,"My parents house(the house I grew up in) has 3 of the biggest magnolia's I know of. 60-70 feet tall.  And they're so close to the house, they had to be limbed up to about 10-12 feet so the limbs wouldn't ingulf the house. But I can tell you, cleaning up the yard as a kid with those trees was not fun. The leaves are tough and thick and the cones are hard & spiked. And you can forget trying to get grass to grow anywhere near them. But they are all the things you say, but also a lot of work too."

16760,best pet for toddlers,"Medium sized dog breeds tend to be better choices for houses with kids because smaller dogs can get underfoot and large dogs can knock children over with ease, just by moving around.

Typically a lower energy breed is best so they’re not bouncing off the walls, less mouthy is always a good choice (mouthy dog breed examples would be Labs, Rotties, Shepherds, etc)

There is no set “breed of dog that is good with children”, it varies quite heavily from dog to dog."

45097,best items under $100,"If you treat the pen more like a phone than a pen, you won't ever lose it. As someone who writes a ton(student), I still find a lot of use out of a pen."
9255,best toothpaste,"As of what I have been taught, enamel has small pores to let ions infuse in. Enamel is made up of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals so infusion of Fluoride ions replaces the calcium ions in the outer layers and thus forming Fluoroapatite crystals that are much more resistant than the former. Enamel breaks down when pH falls below 5.5 while fluoroapatite can resist the breakdown for 30 mins or so(as I have been said).

Ions infusing is also the reason why carbonated drinks are to be avoided because if carbonate ions replace the hydroxyl ion, it renders the molecule more soluble in acids and thus would breakdown easily.

P.S. I am still a 1st yr Dentistry student so I might be wrong in parts, would be grateful if a dentist checks and corrects me :)"
