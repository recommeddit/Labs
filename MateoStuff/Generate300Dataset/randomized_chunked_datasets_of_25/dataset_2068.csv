39440,best web browser,Too bad it's the worst for privacy.
65357,best phone service company,"It's because you had Sprint. Out of urban areas their network is highly fragmented. They pick certain routes and just stop, sometimes will skip sites and leave a huge gap. No service on I-80 from east of Fernley, NV to Utah, about 340 miles or 5hrs @75 mph. For the most part their network engineers suck. My only complaints of Verizon are network congestion and customer service."

32341,best hotel to live in,"I use to work events at hotels and one time we had a guest break their wine glass inside a water refill barrel ... I left work for two weeks to go on vacation and when I came back, all the glass was still piled inside the water refill barrel. People must have been drinking out of it because there were events booked while I was gone"
4891,best home improvement store,Restore!
7621,best laptop for general use,"Hey I got mine on Thursday and started using it on Friday too! The build quality seems solid to me also. I know it's not all-metal but it seems really sturdy and I have an old plastic ASUS laptop that is much more flimsy and all-plastic and it has lasted like 8 years so I don't expect to have much issues with the laptop when it comes to durability. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to take notes on it since this is my first time taking digital notes, but so far the computer has been pretty good, and of course especially for the price."
3392,best webcamera,"Added note, I got 2 of the 90$ cams on sale for $30 each. Local best buy had a sale.


If you want equipment, be sure to look around your area for deals and sales. Facebook marketplace is also a  great place to find a decent hand-me-down camera."
71402,best movies with a cool twist,"Well there were three twists? Did you see all of them coming? I only saw the Angier is still alive twist. It was obvious he survived because they showed him dying in the first scene, but it was just a clone. And yes, that's the brilliant part of the movie that makes it my favourite. When the kid starts to cry on Borden's teleporting man trick. Borden showed the same thing on a bird, and the kid asks: But where is his brother? They also tell Angier that it can't be real magic, so Borden must have a twin. But it was just so simple we just forgot it. And the suspense, the music and everything.. 'Abracadabra'. I just didn't see it coming, it was way too obvious! And the third last twist was that Angier still has clones. Well that was kind of predictable. Thank you if you understand why I love this twist so much, same goes to The game. It's so obvious that it's the last thing you would think of. :)"
29832,best money managing app,"ynab lets you enter everything manually, which is what I do. I don't trust them with access to all of my accounts."
1845,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"The correct answer is Woodstock's. Honorable mentions Giovanni's and Taffy's. If you want to each the pizza that most of us eat on the regular, then Rusty's"
41025,best instrument to play,It's kinda crazy to me how much the diatonicity (is that a word?) of the harmonica (or blues harp more specifically) contributes to how I perceive its sound. I was probably in my late teens or early 20s before I realized that *that sound* on all those Stevie Wonder songs was actually a harmonica and not some flavor of woodwind.
62251,Best RPG game on PS4,"Honestly, I usually try to start with this, because I agree, but then I jsut get caught up with all my problems with it and forget my main thing.  Also, sorry to the op for this thread getting so out of hand"
36758,best alcoholic drink,"Vodka soda (la croix or soda water is preferred, whatever has no sugar), with lemon/lime/berries! 

I can chill with one or get schwasted on 10 if I want, but never have a hangover. No sugar and the water-based component of the drink is my tried and true hangover prevention."
8879,best toothpaste,Why do they put that stuff in it if its bad for your teeth??
60257,best freezer brand,You'll freeze your nipples off
