65357,"It's because you had Sprint. Out of urban areas their network is highly fragmented. They pick certain routes and just stop, sometimes will skip sites and leave a huge gap. No service on I-80 from east of Fernley, NV to Utah, about 340 miles or 5hrs @75 mph. For the most part their network engineers suck. My only complaints of Verizon are network congestion and customer service.",best phone service company

I know it's not all-metal but it seems really sturdy and I have an old plastic ASUS laptop that is much more flimsy and all-plastic and it has lasted like 8 years so I don't expect to have much issues with the laptop when it comes to durability. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to take notes on it since this is my first time taking digital notes, but so far the computer has been pretty good, and of course especially for the price.",best laptop for general use

71402,"Well there were three twists? Did you see all of them coming? I only saw the Angier is still alive twist. It was obvious he survived because they showed him dying in the first scene, but it was just a clone. And yes, that's the brilliant part of the movie that makes it my favourite. When the kid starts to cry on Borden's teleporting man trick. Borden showed the same thing on a bird, and the kid asks: But where is his brother? They also tell Angier that it can't be real magic, so Borden must have a twin. But it was just so simple we just forgot it. And the suspense, the music and everything.. 'Abracadabra'. I just didn't see it coming, it was way too obvious! And the third last twist was that Angier still has clones. Well that was kind of predictable. Thank you if you understand why I love this twist so much, same goes to The game. It's so obvious that it's the last thing you would think of. :)",best movies with a cool twist

41025,It's kinda crazy to me how much the diatonicity (is that a word?) of the harmonica (or blues harp more specifically) contributes to how I perceive its sound. I was probably in my late teens or early 20s before I realized that *that sound* on all those Stevie Wonder songs was actually a harmonica and not some flavor of woodwind.,best instrument to play
