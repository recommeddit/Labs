Thank you! This is exactly the type of info I’m looking for (:
"Random fact, owners of HD and Lowe’s used to be married. Now divorced

This movie firmly puts into scope the lengths Russia will go to cheat.
For allergies or a slight cold I will go on a run to clear myself up. It's only temporary and I'm a runner anyway but you get an hour or so of relief.
"Ologies is (unfortunately) not pg-13, though it is amazing. I can't speak to the others on the list."
Boo! UCLA finish 1st in public universities and my alma mater Cal 2nd.  I demand an audit.
"There’s a good amount of subgenres for racing, but I can’t nail a definitive racing game available so here goes:

**Arcade**: Driveclub

**Sim**: Forza Horizon 4 (PC), Gran Turismo Sport (for PS4 Games)

**Futuristic**: Redout or WipEout: Omega Collection

**Sandbox**: Burnout Paradise Remastered

**Rally**: Dirt Rally 2.0 (I admittedly haven’t played this, but from what I’ve read it’s amazing)

**Kart**: Nickelodeon Kart Racers (until Crash Team Racing comes out, probably)

**Combat**: OnRush

**Soccer**: Rocket League

There’s also Assetto Corsa, Project Cars 1 & 2, The Crew 1 & 2, Need for Speed, Trials series, WRC series, F1 series that are worth mentioning. 

I know that WipEout, Redout, and Rocket League are playable in co-op and are pretty damn fun (Rocket League in particular). Rest are great for playing single player and nearly all feature online play"
Fable two was best
"Oh I only got one pop up asking me why I was there.. just clicked whatever the bottom one said (something like “no thanks,” can’t remember)"
I’ll definitely check them out thank you! Good idea
Guess who's still not married!
"Mint is the best. It allows you to see graphs on where your money is going each month (utilities, fitness, groceries, etc), set goals, and I'm pretty sure it monitors your credit as well. This is great if you have trouble keeping track of your money- you can never believe how much a $3 coffee a few days a week adds up!"
"The Riokaryu Hexa Black is what I'm using.   Love it.

"A small lapse in judgment, no biggie"
"Peanut butter chocolate chip, and lavender from a specific ice cream shop comes close second."
There is a bar in my town that does a special every Thursday where you can get a PITCHER (about 48 oz) of long island iced tea for $5. I usually just have a couple cheap domestics and watch the madness unfold.
Her dad does collect private jets. So does she!
Does a jaw harp or a kazoo have a skill ceiling?
"$5.00 timer like you put on your lights when you go on vacation.  I hook up my electric blanket in the winter set to turn on about an hour before I get in bed, so it is toasty warm!  Then it turns off a few hours later so I don't get too warm in the night.  I felt brilliant when I figured this out!"
"When I look at top-rated lists, I ignore the sequels.  Sequels tend to be overrated, because anyone who dislikes an anime is unlikely to watch the sequel.

I made an alternate version of Animetacritic, using the same set of bloggers, but based on number of favorites instead of average rating.  Maybe you'll like this version more.  Gintama got 3 votes.

"It also has a $395 annual fee (200 for airline reimbursement) compared to the $95 citi reserve, which comes with hilton gold for free.  It's 40k to diamond compared to 75k for Marriott Diamond for the Ritz Carlton.  Where are you getting that it's only 10 nights for platinum?  15 nights towards platinum for the card, and then 3k for each elite night.  If you're implying that the Ritz Carlton counts as 50 nights right off the bat, I seriously doubt that happens as most of the other hotel programs don't operate this way.

Also the SPG comes with 5 nights/2 stays towards elite status, if you have both business and personal that's 10 nights/2 stays and still cheaper than the Ritz Carlton Card."

"Holy shit. I was introduced to the ""Bear Fight"" about 6 years ago in my prime alcohol tolerance days. I had had Jäger Bombs and Car Bombs on many occasions but some kind of evil dark magic occurs when you mix the two. I have never been so fucked up so quickly in my life. I'm having PTSD flashbacks right now."
"Heck yeah Greyhound!

Awesome interval running track."
"Home Depot. I'm in between a Lowe's and a home Depot but I find home Depot has a better selection. Not sure if you're near an Ace Hardware, but we have them where I live. The people there are nice but the prices can be significantly more than home Depot for the same thing."
