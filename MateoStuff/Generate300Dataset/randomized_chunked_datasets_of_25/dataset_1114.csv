The New Zealand Wars.

The British Empire sent large numbers of it's elite soldiery, armed with high-tech weaponry against ""the natives"", from about 1843 to about 1870.

The locals, with no full-time army, adapted quicker then Empire could have imagined, creating disposable death-trap fortifications, impervious to cannons and rockets,  employing tactics and strategies that would be themselves be adapted by the British in Crimea and WWI.

""One authority calculated that Gate Pa absorbed in one day a greater weight of explosives per square metre than did the German trenches in the week-long bombardment leading up to the Battle of the Somme.""

The Maori tribes were never really collectively defeated. The outcome was far from a simple conquest. The Tribes won many battles. Sometimes most of them on some campiagns. Ultimatly they won their rights on the battlefield.",best Mexican war to study

2922,"The difference is only if you work in a studio and need certain impedance for certain source devices. That's the only reason they make it in various impedance versions. 99,99% people could never tell any difference between these and if they say they do, they lie. So for your convenience get lower impedance version which needs less input power to get them working good. Regarding gaming, I have always been playing using closed headphones, mainly Counter-Strike where positioning of footsteps etc. is very important. I have mostly used Audio Technica SJ5 and currently Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250Ohm). People have been surprised on several occasions how much and early I was able to hear and I also feel pretty confident about it so I say closed design is nothing but good for the purpose.",best headphones

58650,"LADDM is more warm, spicy, dry, sweet. It feels like walking around a souk in midday sun.

ACDD is warm and cold at the same time. I feel like this one is more ethereal than spicy, feeling like a desert in the night. It’s still warm and comforting at the same time. It gets to me on a very fundamental, „primordial“ level, hugging me and being around me. I feel like this one is more of a feeling and less of a perfume in comparison to LADDM. I think LADDM is really good as well, but for me I prefer the pure and lonely heart of the desert.",best cologne
