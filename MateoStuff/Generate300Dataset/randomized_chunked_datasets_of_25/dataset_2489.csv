That one is swedish and is called [Nasaline,] (http://www.nasaline.se/) it's large syringe with a rubber nozzle to send warm, slightly salty water (no iodine) through your sinuses, it cleans out and kills bacteria and viral colonies making camp there. It also guarantees 15-30 minutes of no sniveling runny nose.

No clue if it makes my colds shorter, but it makes them a hell of a lot more pleasant.

30514,"This is simply not true; especially if you're thinking of Mexico and the United States in today's context of class and status.

The British and French had speculated heavily on supporting Mexico in defeating the USA; the USA had no international support for the War. 

US president Grant was inspired by the War; as were other Generals Lee, Taylor, Scott and Davis. 

If the USA had invaded Mexico today to take control of the border then your argument might make sense.",best Mexican war to study
