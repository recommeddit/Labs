54351,best medicine for a cold,"[This.] (http://www.sicklaonh.se/images/nikolai_nasaline/Nikolai_och_Nasaline.jpg) Or something like it (not those weird cups, gravity is not enough to penetrate and flush a seriously cold-clogged nostril).

That one is swedish and is called [Nasaline,] (http://www.nasaline.se/) it's large syringe with a rubber nozzle to send warm, slightly salty water (no iodine) through your sinuses, it cleans out and kills bacteria and viral colonies making camp there. It also guarantees 15-30 minutes of no sniveling runny nose.

No clue if it makes my colds shorter, but it makes them a hell of a lot more pleasant. Together with chewing raw ginger twice a day, eating Echinacea, drinking lots of fluid, lifting/walking in stairs as little as possible, and SLEEPING. Seriously, don't do all-nighter binge gaming when sick, it gives you more days of symptoms on the back end of the cold."

25552,best cricket teams of all time,"Oh come on man, you can't make the ""he batted on roads"" argument. He made runs all around the world. If the ""batted on road"" argument had merit, you would rule out Sanga too because Sri Lankan pitches are possibly more batter friendlier than Indian ones.

Like I said, I think Kallis is probably a better player, but there is no way in hell can you can drop Tendulkar if you're making a test XI."

30514,best Mexican war to study,"This is simply not true; especially if you're thinking of Mexico and the United States in today's context of class and status. 

American was only 63 years old in 1846 and was not even close to be described as a powerful state. 

The difference was that the United States was a healthier nation and able to mobilize an efficient military whitest Mexico was not due to internal issues.

Otherwise, neither country was considered 'more powerful than the other'.  

The British and French had speculated heavily on supporting Mexico in defeating the USA; the USA had no international support for the War. 

US president Grant was inspired by the War; as were other Generals Lee, Taylor, Scott and Davis. 

If the USA had invaded Mexico today to take control of the border then your argument might make sense."
