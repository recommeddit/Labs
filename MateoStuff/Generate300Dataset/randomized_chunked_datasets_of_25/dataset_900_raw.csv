"My wife and I have done a TON of all inclusives leaving from Toronto. For our honeymoon we chose to stay at the Excellence Playa Mujares  http://www.excellence-resorts.com/caribbean-and-mexico-destinations/excellence-playa-mujeres

Hands down, the best trip we've taken for the following reasons. 

1. There are 11 restaurant and you can eat at any of the just by walking up, no reservations. Italian, French, Indian, Tapas ect

2. They offer TOURS of their kitchen daily to show how they service all these restaurants and how clean it is. 

3. Swim up rooms and rooms with private pools

4. Alcohol is all top shelf stuff and a health juice bar

5. Soft serve ice cream machine about 1 min walk from our room hah

I could go on, if you want my tripadvisor ID you can read all my reviews, I can be fairly harsh on some resorts but this one really blew me away."

"Look into dumbo rats if you can find them.  They seem to get a little bigger than normal domestic rats (as far as I remember, it's been 15 years since I had them) so they're not as ""fragile"" as regular rats,  and the males I had were super chill and friendly.  

Also, for what it's worth, use aspen as bedding, not pine.  Cedar is toxic to small pets, pine can cause allergies.  Aspen is the healthiest wood chip option, and it's cheap cheap cheap at feed stores. Martin's Cages makes a couple pretty kickass rat cages too. 

(This thread is making my day, love how many ratty owners there are here!)"
