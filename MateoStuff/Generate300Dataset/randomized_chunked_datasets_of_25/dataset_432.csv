5114,"I'm the worst shopper... or what they bank on. I like Lowe's because of how bright everything is, how the store is laid out, and ultimately, I like the color blue over orange.  Yeah, I'm that guy.

Recently, I figured out that my HD had a better selection of wood than Lowe's, but that might've been skewed since there were more morons like me shopping at Lowe's than HD and bought out the good stuff.

I'd thought their prices on lumber would be close but found a deal the other day on 7/16 OSB at HD that was easily $7 less than at Lowe's.

I think Lowe's is like home repair with training wheels and HD is more for serious workers.",best home improvement store

37371,"Universal Orlando. They have the money and the talent to really go all out on it. It is genuinely impressive and worth going for just that even if you skip all the rides. They really transform the whole park.

To a lesser extent, I've never been but I hear Silverwood is really great.

I don't how they've done the past few years, but halloween was the one thing I feel Kings Dominion did better than Busch Gardens Williamsburg. They really ramped up the scare zones the last time I was there during October (2016, I think) and they benefited greatly from having a bit more open space to play with.",best amusement park
