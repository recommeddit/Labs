73664,best battery bank,"7 7/8 oz on the Huawei.  The Aukey, was from their website. I won’t have my hands on it for a month (it’s waiting in the US for me).

29973,best money managing app,I personally don’t trust any free budgeting app because if they aren’t charging you then how are they using data to make money? I also don’t see where an app can do anything special that you can’t do on your own

42482,best detective show,I saw something as of July 23 that said Mindhunter was back on. Did something come out later than that saying no again?
5114,best home improvement store,"I'm the worst shopper... or what they bank on. I like Lowe's because of how bright everything is, how the store is laid out, and ultimately, I like the color blue over orange.  Yeah, I'm that guy.

Recently, I figured out that my HD had a better selection of wood than Lowe's, but that might've been skewed since there were more morons like me shopping at Lowe's than HD and bought out the good stuff.

I'd thought their prices on lumber would be close but found a deal the other day on 7/16 OSB at HD that was easily $7 less than at Lowe's.

I think Lowe's is like home repair with training wheels and HD is more for serious workers."
31963,best hotel to live in,"La Paloma http://www.lapalomalodge.com/
When we went 8 years ago, I think it was $100/person/night all inclusive off-season. Seemed kinda expensive (esp compared to free for the Marriott), but given that it was about 50 times better it was really a bargain.

Edit: Looks like their rates have more than doubled. Still probably awesome though."

37371,best amusement park,"Universal Orlando. They have the money and the talent to really go all out on it. It is genuinely impressive and worth going for just that even if you skip all the rides. They really transform the whole park.

To a lesser extent, I've never been but I hear Silverwood is really great.

I don't how they've done the past few years, but halloween was the one thing I feel Kings Dominion did better than Busch Gardens Williamsburg. They really ramped up the scare zones the last time I was there during October (2016, I think) and they benefited greatly from having a bit more open space to play with."
47555,best state to visit in the United States,"driving through Shasta-Trinity forest made my butthole slam shut. those gorges, and lack of guardrails... 

edit: however, it was gorgeous! similarly, driving north out of SF toward Petaluma during the evening twilight - that was the most beautiful drive I've ever been on."

27160,best board games,"How were the top reviewers determined? I really value SU&SD's reviews & I doubt I'm in the minority. I'm curious why were they excluded

PS This is super neat - kudos!"
5154,best home improvement store,"I prefer Lowe's because they're closer to my house.

I prefer Home Depot because it's generally better stocked than the Lowe's near my house."

3267,best webcamera,If you decide to go with a 2700x then get the 2700 and oc it yourself for additional savings. During the prime day sale I picked up my 2700 for ~150 bucks which was a 50 dollar savings over the 2700x at the time.
