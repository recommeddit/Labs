54094,best medicine for a cold,I'm actually one of those weirdos that doesn't mind the taste. xD
46993,best hand santizer brand,"Isn't Hypochlorite a component of bleach, and pool disinfectant?"
60449,Best comedy show on Netflix,Her character definitely grates as much as she grows on you. I found it helpful to see it as the genius of the actor. Any episode where Moira winds up at the Herb Ertlinger winery is pure gold to me.
1468,best ice cream flavor,"Goat cheese honey and fig I can figure out what it taste like, and must be amazing. Crème caramel should taste very great too. Thanks for your answer!"
52510,best hiphop album,"Big Luda fan, Word of Mouf is that shit."
60722,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Agreed with all of these for sure, but IMO New in Town >>> Come Back Kid when it comes to John’s work."
69319,best major to study in college,"I always loved computers, taught myself programming when I was 14, etc. Due to some not great advice and the recent (back then) dot-com crash, I ended up choosing mechanical engineering as a ""safer path"".

I still enjoy it. But with CS, I could enjoy it *and* make twice the salary."
40133,best Chrome extensions,Dark Reader
26909,best board games,"Maybe slightly atypical, but lots of people play their games more than once. Especially those that are in the reddit guild and contribute their rankings to this list."
14739,best romantic novel,"Anything by Georgette Heyer - they are so rereadable and satisfying, every detail is pitch perfect"
68972,best science fiction novel,"The last line of Rendezvous with Rama gave me chills.

[spoiler](/s ""Not sure the way the series ended was that good though"")"
42123,movies like Inception,Scanner Darkly would be worth a shot.
36795,best alcoholic drink,Pimms and moscato.
45594,best gaming system,"I don't understand why you're telling me this. The use of the console is for playing video games, as far as I know. Not garnering emotional support from strangers, or trying to gin up negative responses then be all butthurt. I'm poor, too. Congratulations."
64062,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"lol the mods I guess don't understand audiobooks...they hid this post.  Every time I post this site here for people to download the mods are like DERRRRRRRRRRRRP IT'S A PAY SITEEEEEE DERPPPPPPP YOU MIGHT BE ADVERTISING DERPPPPPPPPPPP.

Fucken a people are dumb.  It's essentially like audible being free and they have a lot of stuff that audiobookbay won't have."
55003,best water filter,"All I can tell you is that when I poured red Kool-aid into my Britta, it came back as pretty much clear water.  It did have a slightly pinkish tint."
46417,best trick or treating candy,"I'd be that shitty kid who emptied the bowls that some families left by their front door.

Those were pretty big hauls, usually."
44814,best items under $100,"OBDII code reader if you have a car. $20-$50, used with a smartphone app over bluetooth.

Can instantly save you ~$100 for a mechanic to tell you what's wrong. Can save you from buying a money pit when shopping for a used car. 

Google the code + car model and the internet can usually tell you what to do. A lot of the time it can be ignored."
32136,best hotel to live in,"Sprowston Manor in Norwich, England. My husband and I were living abroad for two years and he surprised me with a mini-getaway there for my 23rd birthday. 

The food, the spa, the room.... it was such an amazing experience."
10430,best suitcase lock,"Stay in your house, nowhere is safe"
45665,best trick or treating candy,"Candy corn is great, until you eat the 6th one. It's just a sweet headache after that."
38135,best Marvel movie,"obviously mileage will vary BUT these are the ones that I, personally, would think of as categorically good flicks on their own:

Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, 
Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther

i also love Age of Ultron but it is kind of a mess. Every other Marvel movie i have basically zero interest in rewatching most of the time. Infinity War and Endgame are ok but you have to have seen at least 80% of the MCU already to fully buy into it. (also Winter Soldier is extremely well-loved but it’s just not my thing i guess)"
