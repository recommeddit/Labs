So far I have nothing but positives to say except for the fact that I can’t get credit for my Cydia purchases. I’ve no crashes or stability issues.

25297,"Garfield could have been the perfect one. He is the definitive casting for Peter Parker, he got the looks, the attitude, everything right. But he was stuck in a bad movie.

Tom is great, and he has the advantage over Andrew of actually having a good script to work with.

Loved Toby as a child, i think he was good for the time, but the lack of quips and his overall dummy attitude (which is not supposed to last 3 movies after he gains the powers, he should be confident by Spider-Man 2), makes me think he is the worst Peter Parker ever put in screen. Not that he was bad, he was great for the movie he was in, but as a adaptation of the Spidey i know from the comics? Didn't came close. (Even though his stories were pretty much comic accurate.)",best spiderman actor
