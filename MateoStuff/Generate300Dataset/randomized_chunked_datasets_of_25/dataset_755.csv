32123,"Bakuba eco-hotel in Toliara, on the west coast of Madagascar. 

Eco hotel off the beaten track on a remote beach near local fishing villages. You could walk down from the hotel to the sea and completely pure white sand beaches. 

Designed by a french architect and his wife with gorgeous uniquely themed rooms using African furniture and textiles. The whole building was sculpted like a rock garden/the Flintstones, and ran off renewable power. There were only three guest rooms. The patio looked out onto the strait of Mozambique and I watched the sunset over the ocean from the pool on the deck. Also, French-trained chef. Also, spa and massage tower.",best hotel to live in

Worst story I heard was when his manager booked a whole day for him to snowboard with kids from the make-a-wish foundation.  He rode with a couple in the morning and then ditched to go ride the half pipe.  He can't apologize to those kids because they're dead",best celebrity
9076,"Dental student here, generally its recommended for people to use soft bristles because its not only softer for the gums, but more so to avoid damage to the layer of enamel on teeth. 

You should look up ""Abrasion cavities"" on Google and check out the images. That sort of damage is exacerbated using a hard bristled-toothbrush.",best toothpaste

Let the concentrate unfreeze, mix all ingredients in a punch bowl. Boom! Super strong, fruity, fizzy, tastes like juice. Be warned, people will guzzle and puke.",best alcoholic drink

Yes, there is more than one Smithsonian museum in Washington DC and they are all amazing.
