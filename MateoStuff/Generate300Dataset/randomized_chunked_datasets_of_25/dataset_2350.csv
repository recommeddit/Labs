But now I’m actually crying a bit. 

My cat has been with me through college, my father dying, an abusive relationship, my moms breast cancer (she’s better now), moving across the country, and some other shit to boot. Anything that’s been significant in my adult life he has helped me through and is the only “person” who has been there through it all. I don’t know what I’ll do when it’s his time and has to leave me.

26594,"Faves in my group in no particular order:

**7 Wonders** is a good solid light (vanilla) to medium (with multiple expansions) weight game that everyone seems to like.

**Scythe** is definitely the new hotness in our group. By Kheinom's definitions it pretty much marks the medium-heavy border (I expected it to be well into heavy), and it's just a really well-thought-out design in general.

**Lords of Waterdeep** is another solid contender for the ""middleweight champion"" spot.

**Ticket to Ride**, preferably with the Europe board, has repeatedly shown itself to be a fun, surprisingly light gateway title.

**Amun-Re**, haven't seen anyone mention this auction-based medium-weight title but it's been a favourite since I got it for my brother-in-law for Christmas a few years back.

Lately our lightweight game of choice to start off the evening's entertainment has been **Karmaka**, an easy to explain little card game with lots of room for enjoyable skulduggery. (This spot could easily have gone to **Exploding Kittens**, but there's one guy who really doesn't care for it so it gets played a lot less than it would if not for him.)

We're actually kind of split on **Race for the Galaxy** but those of us who like it, including myself, *really* like it. Others prefer the mechanically similar **Puerto Rico**; I can't get into it as much but that's probably partly because I'm really good at RftG but decidedly mediocre at PR. I tried **Roll for the Galaxy** and thought it was even better, but I've only played it the once so I don't have in-depth knowledge there. Race plays best with the first two, but not the third, expansions, or with Alien Artifacts but no orb game. Anyway, consider this spot to be occupied by whichever of these three games you like best.

**(Settlers of) Catan** is a classic for a reason and still gets brought out reasonably often. I like it vanilla but most of the other people I game with greatly prefer it with the Cities and Knights expansion. We have pretty thick skins and so aren't one of those groups that needs to play with unwritten house rules that you can't use the robber to maximum effect and so on, but it must be admitted that we have had some games of this degenerate into very un-fun scenarios where some people had no chance of winning. But it still has enough going for it, even with its reputation for ending friendships, to make the list if only because without this game lots of the others mentioned here wouldn't exist.

We haven't been playing it lately, but **Pandemic** is one we've had hella fun with. The knock against co-op games like Pandemic is that in a lot of groups one person ends up playing solo with the rest just moving pieces around at their behest. But pretty much everyone I play these games with loves Pandemic. I guess we have the right combination of compatible skill levels, respectful ways of giving and taking advice, willingness to take each other's ideas on board, and when all else fails thick skins that the table-talk never degenerates the way you sometimes hear about. Actually, in some play-throughs I'm one of the dominant players and in others I just can't brain and actually welcome the opportunity to let others do the heavy lifting, go on autopilot, and still feel like I'm part of the game.

There's a few reasonable candidates for the last spot but I'm gonna go with **Power Grid**.

___________________________________________________________________________

So there's a top ten, albeit unordered and with one of the ten spots in a quantum superposition state among three games. A few others outside the top 10 I'd like to say a few words about:

Probably the heavyweight (heavier than Scythe) game we've had the most fun with was **Clash of Cultures**. I've enjoyed **Terra Mystica** far more myself, and if I were just giving my own opinions here rather than trying to synthesize those of my various game peeps TM would easily have made the above list. But until I got it for Christmas last week I'd only ever played it at cons and otherwise outside my usual circles. I definitely look forward to inflicting it on my friends.

Honourable mention to a relatively obscure game I won at a con, **The Dutch Golden Age**, which turned into a surprise hit with our group. Just a nicely put-together victory point Euro with genuinely multiple paths to victory.",best board games
