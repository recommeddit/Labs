3932,Well my school wasn't an online school so I'm not sure. It was a regular provincial college that offers the opportunity to take classes online as a part-time student. You may want to see of any colleges/universities in your area offer the same thing.,best online college
16689,"I've had a two hamsters, one when I was a in my teens and one as a young adult. My first was so friendly. She was a good pet and I enjoyed holding her and watching her play in her ball, running around all over the house. She eventually died though.

After a while I got another hamster who was mean and awful. Very bitey. I always dreaded changing her cage bedding because she was scary. Ever since then, I've been afraid of hamsters because of how vicious they can be.

Now that I'm an adult, I know now that I should ask to hold the hamster in the pet store before committing to take it home as a pet. Still, I'm afraid of that initial interaction and getting bit.",best pet for toddlers
26604,"All of these lists are going to be different but for someone new I would tell you to consider these games: 

**Magic Maze**: a cooperative maze running game that's best at 4-6 players. You and your friends work together in real time to move each character with each player being assigned only one direction of movement. 3-15 minutes, $25

**Century: Spice Road**: a fantastic little game for 2-5 players about acquiring spices and turning them in to score points. It's between print runs right now but you can buy the beautiful Golem Edition for $40 from the publisher (Plan B Games). 30-45 minutes. 

**Junk Art**: the best time 2-5 players will ever have stacking things on top of other things. Easily converts to drunk art with the addition of alcohol. 10 mins, $30. 

**Sushi Go**: a very simple drafting game that's accessible for anyone. 20 mins, 3-6 players, $10

**Azul**: a beautiful tile drafting game for 2-4 players. Somewhat mean at four, cutthroat at two. It's on between print runs right now but retails for $40. 

**Santorini**: a great little two player game that gives that chess like feel with beautiful components and enough variety to keep you coming back. 

**Good Cop Bad Cop**: a 4-8 player deduction game where each team is desperately trying to find and eliminate the other teams leader. 15 minutes, $15

**Monikers**: what charades was always meant to be. Laugh out loud hilarious. Don't play it in public. 60 minutes, $25. 

**Concept**: a brilliant little game where one player tries to communicate a concept using a board of symbols. 30 minutes, $40

**Klask**: basically air hockey the board game. I could play this all day long. Highly, highly recommend. 15 minutes, $50.",best board games
33982,"It uses the same system to catch Pok√©mon from go, it‚Äôs the only game in the whole series to change how catching Pok√©mon works so it‚Äôs not really considered mainline.
Has cool features tho

Sword and shield is good for beginners too I feel (low difficulty and explains everything as if you‚Äôre new or young) i think it even shows you when moves are super effective during battle.

Not much else choice until diamond and pearl in novemember.

Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but you can‚Äôt take Pok√©mon out of let‚Äôs go?

As an undergrad I probably ended up with good grades just because I showed up to class, was respectful, and at least tried to do my work.  And office hours.  As an online student I can't kiss ass quite like that.  So it's all hard work.",best online college

44601,"Tub Shroom. It‚Äôs a rubber plug type thing with holes in it that you put in the tub drain (kind of shaped like a mushroom, hence the name). It catches probably 95% of hair and gunk while still allowing the water to flow down. After your shower, just remove from the drain and pull off the hair (this part can maybe be a little gross, but hey, it‚Äôs your hair) and toss in the garbage. 

They‚Äôre maybe $15-$20, and will save you heaps of time, money, and frustration by keeping your drain clear.",best items under $100

Each school has different strengths though, UIUC is T5 for CS/Engineering, GT is T10 for engineering/cs, UT is t10 for engineering CS, business, UW is at that level for cs and life sciences/pre med etc, UCSD incredibly well rounded. 

To me, those are all STEM T25-30's easily, emphatically, beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

And all of them shine in global ranks like AWRU, THE (globals) which measure STEM faculty research prowess. These schools are an incredible opportunity to learn from geniuses for a much lower price.",best college for research
