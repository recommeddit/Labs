"> he seems to be ignorant of actual statistics.

What do you mean by this? I'm not a statistician or data scientist yet, but I've taken a bit of stats and haven't heard him get anything wrong. What are the big things he's missing?"
"So at any point in time you're sort of looking for the optimal ranking for all teams, not just the ones who played last?  Sounds great. Will look forward to the writeup.

Yeah the ICC one is a kind of mutant distant cousin of an ELO rating, which is easy to calculate and 'right' over the long term, but very unresponsive. I think one of the problems is that the time it takes to adjust to a team's form is similar to the time it takes for the team's form to change."
">I haven't seen it posted but I'm curious, is an Environmental Science degree worth anything? It's what I'm going for and I was looking at getting a job working in national forests. 

Environmental science is a big field which can be a double-edged sword. People with more specific degrees in things like forestry, hydrology, or fish&wildlife or will beat you out for jobs unless your summer jobs / internships are more directly related to forestry.

Of course, getting a more generalized degree can be a good thing because it gives you more flexibility if you decide to do something other than foresty.

I I think it's a great degree, it just requires a little planning ahead."
"I wear the same cologne for the last 5+ years, kenzo power. But it's been discontinued for most of that time. 

Part of me loves trying to find remaining specimens on eBay because I want to be the only one wearing it, but I fear it's starting to get too sparse and expensive. 

Colognes are difficult balance of common and rare."
"Ditto, American here, I know, I did it for a year. I recommend a working holiday visa to everyone. In a span of a few days I was hiking up glaciers, surfing in Mount Maunganui, and clubbing until 5am in Wellington. I would have stayed if I could have tricked a Kiwi into marrying me for citizenship."
Historia Civilis for the Classical History nerds
"I can't be arsed to make the video, but basically it's just me buying it while making guttural sounds of enthusiasm.

In the 90's, however, it would have meant buying it while riding a skateboard."
I always recommend it by showing people [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/lKDcR2w.gif) and telling them it's a yuri-filled cutesy anime.
Ah memories of this Penn & Teller Bullsh!t episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFKT4jvN4OE
"It sounds like you may have allergies by the symptoms you're describing. I would try an antihistamine that is non-drowsy like Loratadine(Claritin) paired with some pseudophedrine. That should help your eyes and your nose.  

However, if you actually have a cold, nothing has worked better for me than Zycam and a heavy dose of Vitamin C.   

I'm not a doctor, just an avid hypochondriac. I hope this helps. Good luck on your date."
"This is a great book on JS, that I can not recommend enough. The introduction of the book also helps lay down some fundamental knowledge of programming.

Itâ€™s free to read online. I liked it so much that I bought a paperback copy."

NYC should hire better history teachers as Texas revolted against Mexico which had already won independence from Spain. Two Texas did not know it was going to win and a lot of hope was place on the US coming to the aid of Texas. In fact Santa Anna and the Mexican army where crushing the Texans until the surprise attack at San Jacinto when Texas forces ambushed an unprepared mexican army and captured Santa Anna.

My kiddo just turned three so I'm not expecting anything. I would really just like a nap and for someone else to cook dinner. Haha

"Finall Fantasy X is my favourite RPG on any console since it's my favourite game of all time.

But also Final Fantasy Type 0 - seriously, more people need to play this game. It has a cast of diverse characters an amazing soundtrack and a very different feel to any FF game - the closest would be VIII I think with the military schools.

I really enjoyed Tales of Berseria too. I thought the characters were all incredibly likeable and the combat was super fun. The main character is unfortunately supremely overpowered, rendering most fights a walk over if you play as her but it was still fun.

The story was extremely generic but the combat and characters easily make up for it. Magilou alone makes up for it.

If you're the kind of person that counts the SoulsBorne series as RPG's then all of those too. Personally I see them as action adventure games with RPG elements but a lot of people would say they're RPG's - especially since you can design and spec your character however you like."
I though sirens of Titan was a superior book to slaughterhouse 5. I guess slaughterhouse is more famous though.
We can make it past the Rof16 soon! ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦2022!
"Currently 3/4 through this one, and it's easily one of my favorites."
I actually prefer Lowe's because home depot only sells coke products.

"Sky: Children of the Light! Beautiful game, great community, something children and adults will enjoy. There are in-app purchases, but they arenâ€™t necessary. Plenty of things to do. Made by the same people that made Journey (also recommend, but not free) and Flower."
"I was in the process of replacing a toilet and needed my husband's help holding it while I got it lined up but his grip was slipping so the toilet dropped by about an inch.  It was just far enough that the edge of it tapped the basement floor and shattered the front of the brand new toilet.  This had already been a hell of a project as I had to replace the flange and re-cement the floor (why the fuck would someone embed a donut-shaped piece of plywood into cement to screw the flange into).  I headed back to Home Depot to purchase a replacement and took my daughter along for the ride.  While at the store a staff member helped me load a toilet onto a cart while I told her the tale of the smashed toilet.  My daughter needed to pee so I left the cart and rushed my daughter halfway across the giant store with the urgency required of a 4 year-old's emergency.

When I got back to my cart there was an invoice sitting on it for $0 stating ""customer satisfaction"" and a hand-written note wishing me a wonderful evening.  

They didn't have to do that. I didn't ask for anything because I was totally at fault.  They definitely won my business that day."
