50791,"Edit: reposting because my original cut off.

My taste varies a little bit with the popular consensus but I am the creator of /r/Czarface so I'm not just a casual fan at least lol.

Definitely check out the last album with DOOM, I think they all brought it including Deck and the production nails the comic book/sci-fi niche. It all sounds ""Volcanic"" for lack of a better word but looking at the album cover it's a good match I think. (Songs: Forever People, Nautical Depth, Stun Gun, Captain Brunch)

After that my favorite Czarface project is their debut; it has great variety in the instruments used for the production. The opening tracks have kind of an X-Men cartoon feel with heavy drums and droning synth bass. The features all kill it, it's hard to describe the sound of this album overall because it kind of shifts towards funkier, live band stuff with guitar and 60's orchestra samples. The features all have solid verses with my favorite being Madlib's Brother Oh No on ""Czar Rafaeli"". Deck and Eso are less polished but their raw chemistry is undeniable. (Songs: Air Em Out, Cement 3's, Hazmat Rap, It's Raw)

However, many people think the best Czar project is Every Hero Needs a Villain. This album has great features and a cohesive, retro-rock sound to it with lots of neat guitar riffs and kick ass drums. I feel that the album is too same-y and hard to listen to the whole way through repeatedly, but it's definitely one of their better projects (It has a song with DOOM too, Ka-Bang, and its solid)

(Songs: Czartacus, Junkyard Dogs, Escape From Czarkham Asylum, Sinister)

Their other projects are ok but inconsistent and the only essential listening I would say is Fistful of Peril, that's just ok",best rap album
