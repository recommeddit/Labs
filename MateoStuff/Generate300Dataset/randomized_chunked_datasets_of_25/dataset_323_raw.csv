"Fine, take a nap, zen ~~fire ze missiles~~ watch ze video!"
"Garlic, not really a secret though. More of a fact."
"Regarding graphic design... this was my major and my conclusion is that you really need to be **really** talented to expect to go far with a graphic design degree, and when I served as TA for any class, I realized that maybe 20% tops of any given class of designers were ever any good. Those who do succeed though can find a lot of demand for their talents. And of course as always, likelihood of finding a job is highly dependent on where you're located/looking for work.

Edit: To add to this, if you factor job satisfaction into the mix... arguably I'd say graphic designers (and other creatives who get to actually do creative things for a career) are some of the most passionate about their job and their work. My colleagues and I would likely agree that we all absolutely love what we do for a living and it's our hobby. So even if we were able to earn a substantial salary increase for working a more administrative or managerial job, we'd probably still rather stick to being designers."
Really? I've heard that before multiple times. Maybe I need to post in the suggestions thread where to go from here
Just created one for CSU East Bay
"Bleu de chanel, Tom Ford noir extreme, versace dylan blue, ck one,"
"Melia White House hotel in London, I’m usually very uncomfortable staying at hotels but I felt right at home there. 
I will definitely stay there when I go to London next time.
They also have a restaurant (the place) which have the most amazing buffet I’ve ever had"
"I got into romance in the last few months so I haven't read that much but I love everything Tessa Dare, The Hating Game and The Kiss Quotient. Knit One Girl Two is a novella but it's so so cute."
Has a question never been answered by another question?
"Sociology was great to study, but I felt forced into Social Work. It also doesn't help that 80% of SW jobs require Spanish, and no matter how much I try, I'm just terrible at learning another language.

I wished somewhere along the time I was in school a professor pointed me in the direction of Public Health, which was my primary focus under the umbrella of Sociology."
GoJump Oceanside is pretty great.  There might be one just as good closer to LA though.
"It's romance adjacent and it doesn't have a HEA, but Call Me By Your Name"

"If you intend to do anything graphics related, linear algebra."
I loved Toby in the original trilogy but Tom Holland does it so well. His nerdy voice and enthusiasm is so good in homecoming.
"Man, I love it too. I mean if you don't like wooden coasters there's no way you're going to like it, of course, but if you do love wooden coasters, Roar is excellent. Super fun and out of control feeling. RMC'ing it would be a kick in the stomach. Enough with the conversions to steel."
"Yes, the EDP is a sweeter, richer experience with a thick vanilla waft on it. They are both fantastic, I’d personally go for the EDT first in terms of versatility, but then EDP for a after work, weekend, or date night scent."
The Adventures of Tintin
"Nice guide, thanks! Looks like I'll probably just go with a fresh pair of zoom structures as mine are battered now. I had the lunar eclipse previously which were insanely comfortable, but they weren't as durable as the structures."
"Ermm. First, I'm not suggesting to start with a production project. When you have a task, you can actually find what knowledge you lack and you will stop asking vague questions ""What tools web-developers need"" when web-developing is pretty huge area and there are a lot of different webdevelopers. Second, knowing all nuances in CSS will not help to write server-side logic. While full-stack developers are pretty valuable, a lot of people still doing either frontend or backend. Third, learning Javascript can be unnecessary with modern tools (e.g. Coffeescript or any non-javascript fullstack framework: it usually generates javascript). There are a LOT of tasks where you don't need to learn JS.

Also there are a lot of pure frontend tasks but I'm not actually skilled in that so I'm not going to make advices here."
Fuuuuuck yes. TAIM & FFAA were two cd's that I spend a lot of time lifting to.
"https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tools/compare/lg-27gl850-vs-asus-tuf-vg27aq/912/1640?usage=9091&threshold=0.1

Found a side by side review of the two monitors we were looking at it seems like the ASUS monitor edges out the LG one in nearly every category except brightness. LG colors are a little better as well."
What's wrong with SNHU? It's a brick and mortar school that has been open for 80 years. Its fully accredited
My Grandmother always made me eat raw garlic when i was sick. That stuff works.
