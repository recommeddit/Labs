67338,axios alternatives reddit,"As a programmer (I'm assuming), I'd expect you to use better reasoning than that. OP laid out why Axios is ""dead"" way beyond just commit frequency."
51363,best iphone case,"Otter box defender case. I literally throw my phone against the wall, works great. Stopped getting AppleCare years ago"
53618,best medicine for a cold,I take Reactine which is Cetirizine and it makes me very drowsy. Should I try fexofenadine?
33008,best energy drink,Well healthy is a bit different for a lot of people. What are you trying to avoid? Sugar? Artificial sweeteners? Artificial Caffeine? GMOs?
55357,best action and adventure novel series,*Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss. Some of the best characters I've ever met.
71501,best movies with a cool twist,"I think that's what gets you. The Christian Bale twist is pretty obvious, and you think you figured out the movie when you notice it. The Hugh Jackman twist is too bizarre to see coming."
21249,best workout music,"BECAUSE YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN IT YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN IT, OOOH YEAH!"
40923,best instrument to play,"I will always upvote Better Off Dead.    


It's a simple ethos, but it's mine."
28860,best breakfast foods,"I feel like this sub's demographic isn't using fruit juice or yogurt besides greek/strained yogurt to begin with, my usual smoothie base consists of dairy, fruit, and protein powder"
70994,best movies with a cool twist,"*Incendies*

*Oldboy*

*Parasite*

*Sorry to Bother You*

*The Usual Suspects*"
66352,best soccer team in the world,"I would like to, but I'm 99% sure that teams like Boca Juniors, PeÃ±arol, River Plate, and Nacional wouldn't even make the top 15, due to the European bias this sub has."
4727,best home improvement store,I think this is the last week for the one closest to me.
68986,best science fiction novel,"Came out a week ago. Grab it, quick!"
8451,best toothpaste,Not many dentists on Reddit?
69492,best major to study in college,Let me know how that works out in a year. The nursing market is almost totally flooded.
7686,best laptop for general use,"No, you can upgrade the RAM. 8 GB is soldered and there is an open RAM slot."
18081,best Kardashian,"I met Kim and Khloe at an appearance. Both as sweet as youâ€™d imagine at an event like that. My impression is that they both really experienced at interacting with people in that context but Iâ€™m sure personally they are much less charming, and more normal! Hahaha

I get the impression Kylie has missed out on that fan experience. For example, Kim had to learn to charm her fans as part of making herself famous, where Kylieâ€™s fans were handed to her so she never had to learn to interact with them!"
25022,best spiderman actor,"I can definitely see your point then. The X-Men movies and the Spider-Man movies put superhero movies into serious category, and the dark knight trilogy showed they could be amazing in their own right."
8000,best laptop for general use,"Thanks for the list! Can you help me narrow down a choice for me? My budget is in the $1,000-1,200 range, willing to go slightly higher if there is a large difference in quality. I am looking for a 15.6"" laptop for mostly basic use like browsing, editing photos from time to time, and I will also be using it for work at times. It will NOT be used for gaming at all. What would you recommend?"
73814,best matte screen protector for ipad,Can someone just invent a 2 in 1 matte-glass screen protector ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© combining bothâ€™s strengths ahhh
32652,best vacation resort,"Especially Bali, which is truly an amazing place to explore. I looked at people cooped up in their little tour buses and felt sad for them. $20/night got me a nice room with a fruit bowl, muesli and coffee for breakfast--perfectly pleasant. Wandered around the city and found an absolutely gorgeous massage place where for $50/each we had quite possibly the best and most relaxing massage I've had in my life..  Got ripped off on a Durian fruit--paid $10.  What a weird fruit.  Keccak fire dancing, local artists (mask makers)...  Learned a lot about their culture, which seems to mix the concepts of commerce and spiritual fulfillment in a particularly effective way.  I definitely learned something from the trip about how to live my own life. The place is just incredible and those poor saps in the tour bus don't see any of it."
29039,best calendar tool,"If your calendar runs your life then 22 cents a day ainâ€™t that bad. Less actually, because your upgrade cycle is usually every couple of years, so 12 cents. I have no problem paying for quality software. Fantastical has a way better UI, excellent natural language support, great x-callback-url support, a great widget, great keyboard shortcuts on the Mac. Think of it as iCal Pro (yes, I know itâ€™s not called iCal anymore)."
70104,best major to study in college,"I agree, it is completely based on talent and location. I've been out of school for about a year and a half, and I have had no problem finding freelance jobs and found a full time job within a month of looking for one. 

I was in a pretty solid design program, and half of my graduating class (the talented ones I would say) got jobs almost immediately. The other half were the slackers/not very good had a lot more trouble find jobs. It truly is an industry based on talent and many people don't seem to appreciate that."
57776,best cologne,Dior Sauvage and Bleu de Chanel represent! Those are my two favorites! I've also repeatedly heard good things about Creed Aventus. What does that actually smell like?
