18081,"I met Kim and Khloe at an appearance. Both as sweet as youâ€™d imagine at an event like that. My impression is that they both really experienced at interacting with people in that context but Iâ€™m sure personally they are much less charming, and more normal! Hahaha

I get the impression Kylie has missed out on that fan experience. For example, Kim had to learn to charm her fans as part of making herself famous, where Kylieâ€™s fans were handed to her so she never had to learn to interact with them!",best Kardashian

32652,"Especially Bali, which is truly an amazing place to explore. I looked at people cooped up in their little tour buses and felt sad for them. $20/night got me a nice room with a fruit bowl, muesli and coffee for breakfast--perfectly pleasant. Wandered around the city and found an absolutely gorgeous massage place where for $50/each we had quite possibly the best and most relaxing massage I've had in my life..  Got ripped off on a Durian fruit--paid $10.  What a weird fruit.  Keccak fire dancing, local artists (mask makers)...  Learned a lot about their culture, which seems to mix the concepts of commerce and spiritual fulfillment in a particularly effective way.  I definitely learned something from the trip about how to live my own life. The place is just incredible and those poor saps in the tour bus don't see any of it.",best vacation resort

I was in a pretty solid design program, and half of my graduating class (the talented ones I would say) got jobs almost immediately. The other half were the slackers/not very good had a lot more trouble find jobs. It truly is an industry based on talent and many people don't seem to appreciate that.",best major to study in college
