70469,best major to study in college,"Going into the degree I figured even if I didn't like a lot of programmers its not a big deal because jobs are going to be mostly solitary and won't require a lot of team interaction.

Boy was I wrong."
2608,best headphones,"They certainly measure well, but their actual sound is very unique.  

Generally neutral means nothing is emphasized and nothing is recessed, but I've never experienced that with the ER4s, mainly because they sound extremely bright and have some huge bass response variance (some notes hit nicely and some are almost not there) that make them not quite neutral in my opinion.  Yes I've had them unamped and ""properly"" amped as well.  

I think what the ER4s do better than anything is analyze the music.  You really can hear everything, nothing is obscured, but there is also almost nothing musical about the sound.  Maybe thats neutral to some people, but I can't really say I agree."

57677,best cologne,"Just go into a shop and don't come out until you find one you really like. Listening to random other people is a total waste of time, because you could pick 'the best one in the world' as recommended by many people, but it's just as likely someone like me would think you smell gross.... Pick something neutral if you don't want to be bold, or just whatever the hell you like if you do. You're the one who has to smell it all day after all."
8355,best toothpaste,"Having an electric toothbrush taught me that I brush my teeth way too hard. Went to the dentist with inflamed gums and they thought it was gum disease. I said I brushed twice daily, I use mouthwash during the day, and I floss. They looked closely and worked out that the damaged gums were along the curvature of my gums, and thus I was pushing too hard. 

They recommended that I don't brush my teeth for a few days (to let the gums heal) - so don't eat anything ridiculous - and use a salt wash to keep my gums clean. Then use a gentle motion with an electric brush (the weight of the brush, no applied force).

They then asked if I flossed. I said yes. They told me to stop because it wasn't doing anything. They then recommended indenture sticks instead - which apparently are better (no idea)."

51266,best iphone case,Same but with a golden phone.
31719,best hotel to live in,"If I wanted to and was disciplined enough it could be 100% since my meals are paid for.  However, I like to drink so I keep a few scotch bottles handy and rack up a bar tab a few times a week.  I am a minimalist and object to buying new things but have a huge weakness for books.  I also like to live life to fullest so any chance I get to have fun whether it is on the road or at home it's usually pretty lavish and extreme.  That being said I probably save 75% of my pay."
8144,best toothpaste,Is there any version of the Sonicare that is recommended?
62907,Best Data Science textbook,The deep learning book by Goodfellow along with Elements of statistical learning are the must.
44810,best items under $100,"I spend a lot of my time (and probably too much money) on education.  I have become an oficianado of school supplies.  Small bit of money for something used so often is worthwhile to me. I detest cheap writing instruments.

Notebooks - Hilroy 8.5X11 coil notebooks, nothing else is even close. Use it for work and studying.  

Mechanical pencils:

Papermate Comfortmate - Best mechanical pencil going. One of the cheapest mechanical pencils, also easily the most comfortable.

Zebra 701 -My favourite. All stainless steel, $30 or so.

Rotring 600 - about $50.  more of a luxury pencil, close contender to the zebra.

Related, I can also speak authoritatively on pencil cases and erasers. 

Also close contenders, a mechanical keyboard and inexpensive gaming mouse, both wired.  The keyboard's a bit over $100, but money well spent for something that I use every day."
63788,best books for building better habits reddit,"There have been recent studies that show that willpower is not depleted, in fact it's the opposite. People who practice willpower are able to do it more and more."

73471,best battery bank,"Weekend warrior only so just a 2800 mah anker, looks like a lipstick tube"
34614,best NFL player,"Well said. QBs by default have a greater outcome on the game, but I really dislike the automatic degradation of every other position by some folks simply because that position is not QB. They're already the most important position, we don't need to pretend like they do everyone else's jobs, which are also important.

Edit for a since deleted response:

>And if nobody is blocking for the QB, their job becomes a lot harder. When receivers aren't getting open or catching passes, their job becomes a lot harder. If the RB can't get going, the QB's job gets a lot harder. If the defense isn't getting stops, their job gets a lot harder. If Special Teams isn't establishing good field position, then everyone's job gets a lot harder.

>Like I said, the QB is probably the most important. But that doesn't mean everyone else isn't important. Its bad enough that basically nobody but QBs can win an MVP, with rare exceptions, but Jerry Rice is reduced to ""Not a QB""."

63089,Best online React course,"I want to write out this message so that I can refer my future colleagues to it in the future:   


I. 

I did 20% of Grider's course. It was great. Yes, he uses class components and this is wrong since the class components aren't used anymore. But, hey, it's not that hard to convert them, right? 

II. 

I did 25% of Schwarzmuller's course, right up to video 116, which is about useReducer. Right up to this video I was liking the course. It was such a great time. 

The point is that I was hardly learning anything new but I was just reinforcing the easy things I learned in the [Web Ninja's course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) which is the best course for a complete beginner. 

But starting from the video on useReducer, I needed to start learning completely new things. And here's where Schwarzmuller failed me! 

No, you are not an idiot if you don't understand him. No, he is not a good teacher. He is a terrible teacher. The whole thing is bad. It's the course with the highest amount of votes. So, is it the best/good? No, it's really bad. I didn't want to have Section III in this post. I wanted to complete Schwarzmuller's course and move on with my business strategy, but I have to go back to Grider. 

III. 

Now I will complete the Grider's course and move on with my strategy. Yes, there will be class components. Yes, there's not enough info on hooks. But you can't imagine how it feels for us, complete newb's in here, to watch Schwarzmuller's videos and slowly start realizing that this is not a place for us. Lots of people quit react for these reasons. Additionally, I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER use the most highly voted course on anything in my life!!! The second highest voted course is the best. 

P.S. 

I am not an idiot. I understand that I need to code my own projects, but I am also a newb coder and I need to complete one video course."

62241,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you’re getting assassin’s creed, DONT GET ODYSSEY. It put a spin on the series that takes away all of its charm and makes it really basic. I would suggest one of the ps3 ones, but syndicate and origins are still good. Also skyrim. Skyrim is insane"
47733,best state to visit in the United States,"South Dakota's obvious one is Mt Rushmore, but the rest of the Black Hills are great for scenic views too. Also the Badlands are worth checking out for too. For tourist trap places there's the (in)famous Wall Drug and the other side of the state has the Corn Palace."
