51517,best iphone case,I have a clear Smartish case on my 11 Pro. It’s great. Prior to that I used a black Silk case on my 7 Plus. Silk is the predecessor company to Smartish. I’ve really enjoyed these cases. Highly recommended by Wirecutter.
65149,best phone service company,"It really depends on where you live and where you use your phone most often. If you often travel outside of urban areas, then Sprint and T-Mobile are kind of useless IMO. If you live in a rural area then ATT and Verizon (or a carrier that uses their networks) are your only real options. I use Visible, they use Verizon's mobile network and it only costs me $25 per month for unlimited everything."

14691,best romantic novel,"Yep. That was the most depressing ending I've ever read. I almost cried, but held back the tears out of fear that Papa would burst out of another dimension with an army of lions to punish me for my unmanly lack of dignity under pressure."
7346,best laptop for general use,"Hi, you definitely can't go wrong with the Apple MacBook Air on my list. Great battery life, good screen, strong performance, etc. Otherwise, if you'd like a Windows device, the Acer Swift 3 with the Ryzen 7 5700U on my list is a great choice."

41845,movies like Inception,Exactly!  I found myself walking a fine line by using the wikipedia episode summaries.  I wanted to ascertain exactly who I was watching without spoiling what they were going to do.  Still a great show.

12490,best gifts for mom,"My mom's dad passed two days before Christmas almost 5 years ago. He was a huge part of our lives and for most of her life, he was her only parent. This time of year has been extremely hard for her ever since, so I had a photo of him put in a glass square and wrote a poem to go with it, since Mom and I are both writers for ourselves. Then I got her a Mantraband that said ""Love you more"" because anytime we would get off the phone with Grandpa and say ""I love you"", the last thing he said before he hung up was ""Love you more"".  

Edit: Grammar"

22173,best celebrity,I am incredibly jealous.
33753,best electric car,"I'd prefer a phev with about 30 miles of electric only range and at least 300hp personally. EV range is impacted too much by driving style and ambient temperature conditions for my liking even after batteries improve a good bit (probably decades from now honestly). 

I saw a blacked out Merc S 560e in Athens last month, thing was silent and pretty sweet."
62256,Best RPG game on PS4,"The world is pretty incredible. It's vast but never gets unruly. I thought the ship combat was snappy. Story was interesting and engaging. I liked the combat and the way the gear is all centered on how you'd like to look, if you want that. It was fun and had that ""what's over thereness"" that I itch for sometimes."
