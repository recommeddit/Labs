Mine is vodka diet coke, or if I'm going cocktails I like Mojito or some of the fruitier ones. Melon Ball (or something like that) is pretty good."

65623,best phone service company,"###### this $30/Mo plan? Unlimited Talk & Text, 6GB High-speed 4G LTE Data + Mobile HotSpot, Unlimited Video Streaming, Rollover Data

###### it appears that  the ""unlimited video streaming"" doesn't count against the 6gb but their site doesn't say whether it is or isn't HD or throttled."

38510,best newspapers to read,"I haven't read a newspaper or watched the news (in full) in several years. It's just disappointing to have to wait days for information that I learned online, or where the only new information is a local murderer or rapist. 

Throughout my childhood I always looked forward to reading the newspaper before school, but now it just isn't good enough."

66441,best soccer team in the world,They beat the mighty Chile recently... which brings me to question how the fuck we (Chile) are ranked so highly in the first place having missed out on the last World Cup. We are living off the points from somehow making our way into the last Copa America's semi-final.
27491,best bollywood actor,Isn't Khilji more of the script writers fault tho? Khilji was evil irl but yeah not as uncivilized as SLB makes him out to be.
67696,axios alternatives reddit,"It's not in Node cause it's a web API, not an ES API. Just like `Window`, `DivHtmlElement` etc. isn't in Node."
70583,best major to study in college,"So I think a lot of good suggestions here. If you have good people skills, then sales is probably a decent way. 

If you have enough grit and you’re willing to put in the effort, you can get good at math and go through engineering school. If you’re not interested in engineering, then don’t do it. You will be disappointed. 

If you don’t care about the type of work and just willing to bust your ass, get into accounting or finance. Can easily make 6 figures there. But again, this is number heavy (maybe not calculus heavy)

If you don’t want to learn math and don’t mind working with your hands, you can go to welding school for 2 years and come out making 6 figures. This is one of the highest ROI’s due to low cost. (Student debt is expensive). 

There are also hospital tech jobs such as radiology technicians who make bank after 2 year training. And that’s a seriously recession-proof job. 

I donno, it’s not really that hard, but it might not sound like a dream job or be what you’re interested in. No matter what, you will need some schooling, you will need to work hard."

68319,best science fiction novel,"Dune Messiah was alright, but not my favorite - but I absolutely loved Children of Dune. I've heard from friends that God Emperor Dune is fantastic, but gets way way out there (which considering this is Dune, it has to be WAY out there) and also jumps thousands of years into the future.  


After those, I've heard it goes downhill."

6731,best iPhone,"Second that. I have now the 11 Pro from work but I would have kept the X for years to come. It’s the perfect form factor for me and battery life compared to the non plus sized phone is great. 

And the 5 at launch. After all, that design stayed on for almost a decade."
