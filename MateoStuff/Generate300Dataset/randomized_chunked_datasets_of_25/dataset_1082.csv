37446,"Universal. Specifically Universal Orlando Resort and their Potter additions. With the opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Hogsmeade in 2010 they pretty much redefined what a theme park land could be, integrating attractions, food and merch seemlessly. Then they did it again in 2014 with Diagon Alley. And then this year with the opening of Hagrid's they continue to push the boundaries of what a themed attraction can be.",best amusement park

68152,"Against a Dark Background is my all time favourite book, any genre, period. Bleak as hell but doesn't look like it at first. By the end you realize that everything is futile. People like to say humanity's position in the Cultureverse is to show how insignificant we are. I found Golter's situation a lot more scary. 

Excession is just great, in basically almost every possible way. Shows that humanoids are again, insignificant. A book mostly about Minds will be great any day. 

Blindsight is scarier than any horror, without actually pulling (too much) horror elements. It petrifies the mind. Sadly Echopraxia didn't pull off any similar effect. 

Glasshouse. Stross is always full of ideas, but I found the A-gates and how he incorporated them in his world really fascinating. 

Man, too much to pick one last. Let's say Dune Messiah. Love Paul's arc, and Herbert really started the expansion on what he meant by prescience not being a joke.",best science fiction novel
