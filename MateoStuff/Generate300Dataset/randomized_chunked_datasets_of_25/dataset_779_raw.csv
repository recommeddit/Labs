Call me basic but vanilla
Interesting your find Corramandel hard to wear!
Where do you teach? I make about half that.
Nice! This might be what I've been waiting for. Checking if she is touring in my parents'  city.
"Me: I'm from buffalo. 

Other: oh is that near New York?

Me: it's in New York.

Other: like in Manhattan?"
"If you read the comments, it seems that what he claims isnt an honest finding. I had mine tested to see if there is any way they could cause damage to my eyes and I was told that these were perfectly fine."
"Half of the recommendations here don't have ""plot twist"". A plot that has twists and turns does not equate to a plot twist imo.

Also just the fact that a movie has a plot twist, is a spoiler in itself.

With that some of my favorite :

Sixth Sense

Unbreakable
 
Split 

Fight Club

Primal Fear 

The Illusionist 

Saw I. All the Saw movies have a plot twist, but they are none are as good as the original. 

The Prestige 

Oldboy 

Upgrate (2018)

The Usual Suspects

Gone Girl"
"Because no one mentioned in yet, the tulip poplar:) so tall and very odd flowers"
That's only because no-one ever listens.
Salted Caramel Blondie from Ben & Jerry‚Äôs all the way
Anthony Davis seems to be a funny guy
A sonic toothbrush. Durr.

"Austin is incredible. The food, the nightlife, the public festivals, south congress, art galleries, kayaking, the greenbelt, etc... Plus you've got round rock donuts to the north and saltlick BBQ to the south only thirty minutes in either direction. Plus there's the longhorn football team! Definitely come here, I'll even offer my place for you to crash :)"
"I actually blind-bought several of those Wanderer ones for like, $3 each at Walmart. None of them really interested me, but none were bad, either. I remember I had to wait like, 20 minutes for a clerk to come and unlock the cabinet LOL."
Not like his name became a verb or anything...
Don't let /u/rogersimon10 show up at your place
"Kim: Very hard-working and ambitious. But superficial and cold at times to her own family.

Khloe: I think she is the funniest and kindest. She is also very hardworking. But she's insecure and allows herself to get taken advantage of.

Kendall: She's pretty but she seems the most out of touch with reality.

Kylie: Very entrepreneurial, influential, and has a unique style. However, I think she hides her personality on KUWTK for some reason and comes across very blah.

Kourtney: I'm sure she's an amazing mom. But she's very self-centered, often rude, and she lacks drive and ambition."
Saved so I can try to find a used one on the ebays one day when I have money again
"I mean, you're starting out with Zealios, in many respects it's going to be downhill from here, you'll have some sidways choices, though."
Benjamin Moore has been the best as far as far as overall quality. The best white is very much depending on an individual opinion and if your decor goes well with warm or cool tones. The best method for choosing your white is to go get some samples of what you think you'd like and find a couple places to paint swatches right on your wall.
"Buy ps4, god of war, modern warfare and a stack of snacks. Voila you can kill over 100 hours of time.üëç"

I really thought the elevator story was going to go a different route.
You‚Äôre both wrong. I suggested BFG division.
