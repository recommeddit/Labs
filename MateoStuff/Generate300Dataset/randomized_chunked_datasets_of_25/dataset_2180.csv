59304,best perfume,I LOVE Mademoiselle - but it smells terrible on me.   So I keep a bottle in my car and sprits the upholstery every few days.  And my wife has learned to wear it when she wants my attention - though to be honest I love the stank of her sweat too... so perhaps I’m just a strange woman.

Brita takes out the chlorine (which they use to sanitize the water) and lead (which shouldnt be there in the first place).  It might also remove some organic compounds that influence taste.

""Solids"" being whatever dissolved material whether it be salt or cyanide is in the water."
