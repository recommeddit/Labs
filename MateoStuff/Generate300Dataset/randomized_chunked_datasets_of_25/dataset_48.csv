20326,best workout music,"I mostly listen to rap in the gym but let me tell you something special, on the way to the gym, put on ""September"" by earth wind and fire loud as shit in the car or in your headphones. Tell me you don't walk into the gym happy as a motherfucker ready to crush shit."

47702,best state to visit in the United States,"For the Atlanta area, skip World of Coke. 

Check out the Clermont Lounge."
20574,best workout music,Meddler always gets me going.  Also Parkway Drive.
49477,best gaming monitor,"Yeah, I did that through Windows. It's definitely the panel. Cool is the only setting where it's as good as it gets when it comes to white but it's no biggie. I might just be too picky and too used to the richness of my LG. It's only day 2."
46518,best trick or treating candy,"Fucking pennies, close relative to the ass pennies"
65010,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Cuca's is my favorite burrito. Craft Ramen is in high rotation these days. Mesa Burger is pricy but decadent. Taffy's is dope.
31194,best country to live in,"Chattanooga sounds interesting to me, actually. I'd say for my local municipality whenever I've applied to a government job I've never so much as gotten an interview, though. I think a lot of people want those jobs for the exact same reason you suggest. When particular benefits aren't typical, they make a job more competitive."
50579,best rap album,"what are you talking about the end of devil in a new dress is like the best mixing i have ever heard. you have violins, a soul sample, a guitar, snyth, and drums  and they all melt and swirl into one sound. they feel lie one entity."
32332,best hotel to live in,"I wonder what percentage of hotel rooms have had someone die in there. Does the bed get switched out? I’m telling you, in the hospital I worked end of life and we clean it off, someone new comes in 30 min later...."

60013,best perfume,Al-Rehab perfume oils are great.  My favorite is Choco-Musk.
19280,best YouTube video,"The one where Drew stumbles in his line delivery and Ryan follows up with nonsense, resulting in the whole song falling apart as none of them could stop laughing was pretty good. I think it was on one of the blooper reels. It was from the episode with Colin's running ""meow"" joke."
1477,best ice cream flavor,"Favorites as an adult: Pistachio, Black Cherry, Mint Chip  
Favorites a kid: Tutti Fruiti, Daiquiri Ice, Rainbow Sherbet  

The strangest flavor was Tamarind. This was ice cream not a sorbet. I really thought it wouldn't work."

They sell gift cards for fucks?  I'll take yours if you don't want them."

23141,best social networking site for CS,"Agreed, but some people consider github to be a social network. Having a github profile with some work examples is a good idea."
9301,best toothpaste,"Also, be careful with the toothpastes that have stannous flouride (like Paradontax) or gum rinses with Cetylpyridinium chloride (like Colgate Gum Health). You can use occasionally but don't use primarily as they can cause tooth surface staining, which is removable by the hygienist, but I'm sure you don't want your teeth looking worse"
20754,best workout music,Babywipe by ski mask the slump god
52272,best hiphop album,"Yeah, they're all classic, it's close ranking them for sure but whenever I think about the tracks on the first album...I think the opening track Push It Along is one of the best openers of any album. Who opens their debut album with an almost 8 minute long track? Tribe. And then I've always had a soft spot for all the tracks outside the singles - Luck of Lucien, After Hours, Youthful Expression, Rhythm, Go Ahead in the Rain...I love em all. And then closing with Description of a Fool is so dope to me"
25277,best spiderman actor,"I literally had a dream that i was spiderman last night, it was a brilliant dream"
