"I shared this before but it's definitely the best purchase of my life.

When I was about 10 years old my parents and I were in our backyard clearing out a ton of weeds that had gotten out of hand. I had trouble focusing because our next door neighbor had this really adorable puppy and all I wanted to do was play with him.

We found out that they were actually going to take him to an animal shelter because their son was not taking care of him like he promised. I decided to ask my parents if maybe we could get him instead. I was an only child and never really have anyone to play with unless a friend would come over and the thought of having a puppy to play with whenever I wanted to was great.

My parents agreed and our neighbors offered to sell him to us for $20. I had that saved up and immediately agreed and promised I care for him and love him forever. So, he became my puppy, my brother, and after a few days of debating I named him Snoopy.

Snoopy became my closest friend. He made me laugh, played with me, and would just hang out and watch TV with me. He was always there for me, especially through some tough times in my life where I was extremely self-destructive. He saved me from myself. He was there at my side through tough breakups where all I ever wanted to do was lay in bed. He was an amazing friend. He was there to see me graduate 8th grade, high school, and college. I hoped he would be there on the day I got married and maybe be around for when I had kids, but unfortunately as much as we wish for things, sometimes they don't happen.

He passed three years ago, after being by my side for almost 17 years. Not a day goes by that I don't think of him though and I know how much of an impact he had on my life. Years of friendship, happy memories, and love.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/rSliuc1.jpg) is the first picture of I have of us together and [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9myIo.jpg) is the last.

It never would have happened if I hadn't asked my parents if we could have him. I don't think my life would be the same without him and even though I'm sad he's gone, I'm grateful I had him in my life. 

Edit: [Bonus picture of him looking cool I found while looking for something else](https://i.imgur.com/mNzzEsk.jpg)"
i do the crossword in the paper on break at work.

That is actually a really good impersonation. It got weird in the end o.0
"It very much depends on what you're looking for, but it is generally a decent device."
"Thank you, that means a lot. I hope it catches on, I would love to be a part of my country's emergence in the Cricket world ;)."

"So awesome, thanks!"
Full Scottish - as above plus sliced haggis
"For me it is:

1. K-ON! - Great animation about drinking tea and making fun of used jokes. It has its unique charm, especially in the last episodes.

2. Kino's Journey: the Beautiful World - it's hard to explain. It's describes differences in societies and laws through journey on talking motorcycle. It's philosophical slice of life.

3. Devilman Crybaby - amazing style and storytelling. I love those surreal sequences of pure brutality or insanity.

4. Planetarian: the Reverie of a Little Planet - beautiful, subtle and moving. It's also really short (5 episodes).

5. Monster - great plot; many characters with individual traits, story, and purpose."
"Happy Birthday! I love anything sweet and fruity. If I’m going to a cocktail place I’ll have a Pornstar Martini, and if that’s not on the menu then anything sweet (I look for passion fruit, cherry or raspberry flavours). If we’re doing wine I like white Zinfandel. If I fancy spirits then usually either amaretto and cranberry juice or flavoured gin/vodka and lemonade. 


Edit: apparently I can’t spell"
"Excuse me, it’s actually spelled “Kulie”"
"They restock quite often, once a week or so. Worth the wait imo."
"1. Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn

2. Legend of the Galactic Heroes

3. Gundam Build Fighters

4. Senki Zesshou Symphogear XV

5. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

6. Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans

7. Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds

8. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

9. Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka?

10. Casshern Sins / Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, with the former making it onto my MAL because I already have three other Gundam shows on the list lol

I'd slot the second Gurren Lagann movie somewhere near the top if I was counting movies, but for simplicity's sake I prefer keeping my favorite movies separate from my favorite anime (to say nothing of the fact that Gurren Lagann the *show* is already on the list anyways)."
"As a New Zealander: We live so goddamn far from the rest of the world, it sucks so bad. Shipping costs are through the roof and even just going to Australia is a HUGE deal.
Plus, the internet is really slow."

That would be nice if they do that. It would make the JavaScript ecosystem feel a bit more universal.
The Fall is incredibly well done. But it literally took me three years to be able to watch another serial killer show after that. It's extremely heavy/disturbing so just make sure you're prepared.
"In my experience, you get the best coffee by getting unground beans and grinding them yourself. I've heard that the type of coffee maker also plays a part. For instance, a nice french press will make better coffee than a black and decker from walmart. My parents use a keurig with fresh ground beans and its fucking delicious, even black."

"Mine are from iTunes:
-Big Ideas - some science, some more general topics covered as well, some science policy and education.
-Quirks and Quarks - don't listen to it myself, lots do, it's under the CBC section of iTunes podcasts.
-There's a handful of French ones whose names I can't remember right now. I'd look them up, but I only ever open up iTunes about once a month to reload, because it's such a piece of garbage (though if it ran at a decent speed I would only notice how well it facilitates organization)."
If I was paid to use emacs I still wouldn't do it
The Cell?
Thanks! Manzanita sounds awesome for location and rooms! Ahhh too many choices!
