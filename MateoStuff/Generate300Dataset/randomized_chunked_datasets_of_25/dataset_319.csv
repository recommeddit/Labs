72713,"GPX is way too expensive for what it is imo. It’s a good mouse, but the value is insane in a bad way. 150$ for a mouse with omron 20m’s, passable side buttons, a scroll wheel button that’s very hard to press (some people like that, but I don’t), very thin stock feet with poor longevity and no replacements included, and it uses micro usb. Sure, these aren’t terrible flaws, especially the micro USB isn’t THAT big of a deal since you rarely need to charge it, but if I pay 150$ for a mouse I expect better features than that. I expect near-perfection for that amount of money.

After I just wrote that paragraph I realized that OP mentioned “disregarding money” but I spent time writing that rant and I’ll be damned if no one reads it lmao. The rest of my comment will ignore price!

If you want the lightest wireless gaming mouse on the market with good build quality and a shape that anyone can use, then yes the GPX is exactly that, but for me that’s not all that’s needed for a mouse to be “the best” imo. 

Some mice like the XM1r and the Pulsefire haste have such good cables that it really doesn’t matter that they aren’t wireless, and they have better clicks, better side buttons, better stock  feet with replacements included, better scroll wheel, and a shape that won’t be as safe, but that can be the best for someone. Safe shapes are good for everyone, which is a good thing for people who don’t want to try a million mice, but they’re rarely the best for anyone. 

If you ignore price, then paracording the mouse is also free correct? If that’s the case, my top 5 in no particular order consists of the following:

M42, Viper mini, Pulsefire Haste, XM1r and Ducky Feather (ducky feather is my least favourite out of the 5 though).

I’ve tried the GPW and quite a few other wireless mice, and while it’s nice to have a wireless mouse, I value other features over wireless that the GPW lacks. 

I’m hoping to get my hands on a zygen np01s later this month, it might dethrone the ducky feather and join my top 5!",best wireless lightweight mouse

60192,">drain lines and ice makers with Samsung

Just did the iced over drain fix on my 9 year old Samsung this weekend.  So many rusted out parts behind the panel.  Is it worth replacing the rusty metal plates or the whole panel and evap coil assemblies or should we just say our prayers it doesn't freeze up again and go shopping now?  Was hoping it would last until selling the house in the next year or so, but no spare fridge means we can't go without if it completely craps out.",best freezer brand
