25115,best spiderman actor,I'm so pumped for it though... my fave villain of all time plus my favorite actor? I lost my shit when I found out Hardy was playing Venom... if it ends up awful it will definitely be from either shitty directing or writing (like Assassins Creed)
65536,best phone service company,"[Cannon] - Plateau is the regional Telecomm/ISP here, and have pretty great coverage. They will be merging with AT&T though in about 6 months, plus AT&T will be putting up more towers in the surrounding area. So, if you will be PCS'ing here in that time frame, hold on to your AT&T device.

Verizon also has great coverage, but they will be #2 here once AT&T takes over Plateau."
