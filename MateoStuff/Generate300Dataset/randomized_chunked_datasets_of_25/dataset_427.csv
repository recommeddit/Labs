67540,axios alternatives reddit,"For `fetch`, you might want to replace that

    if (res.status !== 200) {
    }

with

    if (!res.ok) {
    }

`res.ok` will be true if and only if the status code is greater than or equal to 200 and less than ~~400~~ 300.

I'm pretty sure you know and just made a typo, but you'll also want to `await` that `res.json()`."

16572,best pet for toddlers,"I’d vote no on hamsters personally. 

They’re just a mess. They can escape (neighbor just cut through her drywall because somehow hamster got in there and then couldn’t get back out), they don’t always do well in pairs (had 2 growing up. Well 1, who always killed her partner so a rotating second hamster), and they get the shits and die pretty easily (niece upgraded her hamster to a dog when it died a week after they brought it home). One of my friends got one and her therapist was like ‘wtf were you thinking? Never get a hamster!’ Lol. 

I know you said space is tight, but a small dog might be a good fit. Particularly if you can find an older one that is good with kids. We had our Pomeranian in 2 NYC apartments that were like ~800 sq feet and he was fine with it. He got walks twice a day and mostly wanted to sit near the window and sunbathe."

44460,best items under $100,"I'm glad at least one of the groups listened to you.  I've met a lot of folks who do SAR/PSAR, and they all seem to agree that people greatly overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the environment.

For my part, I'm totally okay if everyone else on the trail makes fun of me for being overprepared.  I'd rather be the nerd who takes extra water, snacks, a headlamp, a first aid kit, compass and topo map, and layers on a simple 4 mi. hike than risk becoming just another statistic.  I've also had to give folks some of my water on more than one occasion (too many people seem to think a 20 oz. bottle of Dasani will be sufficient for a 5+ mi hike in the desert or mountains), so I often carry an extra bottle tucked in my pack."
8067,best toothpaste,"The last one WOULD be here, but he died of tooth decay."
