9658,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Santa Cruz is really social dorm. I work there as DA (desk attendant), they have the F.Y.R.E floor (First Year Resident Experience) so they have a lot of social events. And they have their own theatre room, which is always a competition to check out. Lots of other stuff as well, but the Lead Staff is super social and cool with the residents too. I may be biased, but many other freshmen from other ResHalls always talk to me at the desk waiting for their friends saying they wished they had picked Santa Cruz. 

##**But just like anything else in life, it‚Äôs what YOU make of the experience!**

Edit: Santa Cruz was also just newly renovated as of last year."

51518,best iphone case,"Hey OP, I know this post is a few days old. But if you like the slimness of the phone and only care about protecting against small nicks and a scratches, I would recommend the Peel / MNML / other super slim cases out there. It feels as if they're not there & you avoid the extra bulk that'd be added to the phone."
21143,best workout music,"Not to mention the movie was great.  Definitely one of Disney's underrated ones.  I wish it had been more popular, but alas, the message of ""Go out and earn what you want!"" is far less popular than ""Wait and someone else will come along and solve your problems!"""

7494,best laptop for general use,"2099 usd for Aorus and 2199 usd for MSI. Which one would you recommend me and why? Sorry if I sound a bit rude. üòÖüòÖ

Edit: I went to the store again. They gave me the final price with tax (186 USD) and protection stuff (includes malware installation and hardware fixes as well as extended return period to 60 days but the price is 199USD) and it bumped up to 2500‚Ä¶ for aorus‚Ä¶ my goodness. Do you think it‚Äôs worth to get the protection if I am leaving the US in like 1 month and a few days? Do you know how much it might cost to get malware as well as installing windows 10? Please guide me! Thank you for your patience dear legos45 üôè I am a total newb with PC stuff as I have been using mac forever since the beginning.

Edit: sorry I just realized this is a general computer thread not the gaming laptop thread"
