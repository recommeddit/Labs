It seems pretty neutral to me. It’s hard to give a drink with 2 ingredients a set gender.
Used to be but that’s not true anymore. You have to look. The ProNamel stuff doesn’t have it.
"I had Sprint for 10+ years. When we would go on vacation (California, Massachusetts, Florida, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Texas) with family who had Verizon. 98% of the time they either had better service than me. Of course that’s just anecdotal and of course Sprint VS Verizon."
"The best is anything peanut butter (not so much for my brother though when little, he's allergic), twix, three musketeers, kit-kats, skittles, candy corn. 

The worst are tootsie rolls, those really chewy caramel candies, starburst (sorry, I can't do chewy D:), any type of jaw breaker, and tootsie roll lollipos. Oh and hubba bubba gum."
I think it has a solid argument for best of the MCU
"I have large codebase with Redux and I can tell you it tend to slow down a lot when you relie to much on it. Now much of our reducers are legacy and I hate to touch it. Of corse, some dev decisions made before me were wrong and the redux could have been faster, but sometimes you just don’t realize of fast it is growing!"
"I recommend Chicago, personally. I went last summer and was amazed. While stereotyped as a dangerous city, this is mainly concentrated in several low income areas on the South Side. The core of the city is incredibly beautiful, safe, and very walkable. It will get quite cold if you visit during the NFL season (Chicago's NFL stadium is located downtown, right next to the famous Grant Park) but it sounds like you enjoy that!

For sightseeing, I recommend the John Hancock Building, Sears tower (These first two will give you two great different views of the city from above), Chicago River architectural boat tour (A boat takes you around Chicago via its prominent river and a tour guide explains the historical significance of the surrounding buildings), Navy Pier, the Chicago River Walk (pedestrian path built beside the river), and the L train, among other things.

If you're looking to extend your stay and see other parts of the country, Chicago is also ideal because it is one of the main centers for rail transport in the US. This includes many wonderful overnight trains with sleeping accomodations. Not only can you take the train to another city, but you can see the country's incredible scenery roll past as you get there. I took a train back to my home in LA, but if you don't want to go there as you mentioned you can take trains to Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and more. 

Sorry for the long comment with poor formatting (I'm on mobile), I just wanted to share my experiences. My Chicago/overnight train vacation was by far the best I've ever done!"

"But technically if 5 of 5 dentists recommend it, 4 of 5 recommend it as well."
"I highly recommend her book. The formula is basically foolproof (I had one batch turn out screwy, but I'm pretty sure that's because I scalded the cream)."

"interesting. where i'm at verizon owns band 5, but whenever i get nationwide 5g its either on 2 or 66. are there particular NR bands that correspond to band 2, 5, and 66, respectively?

I try to research this stuff, but hard to find good sources."
Polarization is a result of a membrane added to the lens during manufacturing that costs pennies...
"I think a big part of that is that many places don't want nurses with NO experience.  If they get any sort of internship with clinical experience before applying, I think it'd be much easier to get hired."
"Above manjaro/deepin for sure, going by subreddit subs its even with debian."
History classes are very honest. The government telling its citizens really happen during a given event in history well that is another story.

You're welcome. Now you understand Awkwafina and Simu Liu did not actually ride a dragon and defeat mythical creatures in real life.
Thanks! I can't wait to get off from work so I can start it!
