She's hot af, especially in that Dewford episode.

Last good region was Sinnoh, trust me. Hoenn and Sinnoh just went together so well in the anime and games.

Sure, reading inspiring books or stories is awesome and may benefit alot on your person, but at the end of the day to really overcome your weakness you need to SLOWLY work on yourself everyday, and get gradually stronger. That's why i advise you to read the wonderful book i mentioned and at the same time slowly building good habits consistently... trust me this is the best advice you can get. DO NOT TRY TO GO ALL IN and to destroy every bad habits and at the same time adopt 999 new habits. Try to change something every week, like waking up 1 hour earlier and then the next week 2 hours earlier. Then the next week you also spend 30 minutes more working instead of procastinating. You got the idea. Good luck mate",best books for building better habits reddit

Portland is where a lot of chefs who worked at those high-end places go when they want to start their own restaurants, so they're almost as good but a lot cheaper. Definitely look up the original Pok-Pok in SE Portland. It's an institution.",best state to visit in the United States

List of random brutally honest opinions.
BP was overrated, the character is super cool, CGI was a massive let down in the final fight.

Doctor strange’s character is way better than the movie.

Captain Marvel movie is way better than the character.

Endgame sucked.

i really can't think of another actor that could pull that off.

Jim Carrey was amazing. A 4 year run (1994-1998) of The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura 1&2, Truman Show, Liar Liar and The Cable Guy. IMO probably the best collection of quotable movies from one actor.",best movies with a cool twist
