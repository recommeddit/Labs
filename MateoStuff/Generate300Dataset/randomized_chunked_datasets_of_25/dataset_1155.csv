33958,best Pokemon game,"Hoenn had May, all you need to know.

She's hot af, especially in that Dewford episode.

Last good region was Sinnoh, trust me. Hoenn and Sinnoh just went together so well in the anime and games.

We didn't lose Brock, Brandon, Battle Frontier, or May. 


Sinnoh needs a fucking remake holy shit. Hoenn and Sinnoh for life."
17499,best iOS game,"I really like Holedown for paid games, simple addictive fun. Shame it’s not longer.

Playing Dragalia Lost right now, first gacha game I’ve found myself enjoying."
9182,best toothpaste,i read this in christopher walkens voice
66346,best soccer team in the world,"Ajax, Juve, Inter, Liverpool, Real IMO. I did it from a mostly historical standpoint; Barcelona and United’s periods of immense success are relatively recent (past 30 years) though they have always been big clubs."
3039,best webcamera,"Yes, demand has decreased pretty drastically and has allowed supply to catch up."

20233,best workout music,"I feel like this has to be in everyone's top ten, even if you hate rap and/or Eminem. If you don't think so, then how about you listen to it."

63824,best books for building better habits reddit,"The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. Seems like it could really help you. But first let me tell you a thing about changing habits. Do not rely on external motivation. Sure, reading inspiring books or stories is awesome and may benefit alot on your person, but at the end of the day to really overcome your weakness you need to SLOWLY work on yourself everyday, and get gradually stronger. That's why i advise you to read the wonderful book i mentioned and at the same time slowly building good habits consistently... trust me this is the best advice you can get. DO NOT TRY TO GO ALL IN and to destroy every bad habits and at the same time adopt 999 new habits. Try to change something every week, like waking up 1 hour earlier and then the next week 2 hours earlier. Then the next week you also spend 30 minutes more working instead of procastinating. You got the idea. Good luck mate"
51316,best iphone case,"Decided on the Spigen Ultra Hybrid with magsafe as the clear apple case last year was an accident waiting to happen. Apples leather was also terrible last year, with one case chunking in months and the replacement snapping by the volume buttons this week.

47423,best state to visit in the United States,"If you're interested in food, you could hardly do better than San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. On the San Francisco side, you'll get the really high-end places like Boudin or French Laundry. 

Portland is where a lot of chefs who worked at those high-end places go when they want to start their own restaurants, so they're almost as good but a lot cheaper. Definitely look up the original Pok-Pok in SE Portland. It's an institution."
37633,best Marvel movie,"Nah, I’m happy for the crew that got the nomination. A lot of work was put into it and I’m happy to see it was worth it.


List of random brutally honest opinions.
BP was overrated, the character is super cool, CGI was a massive let down in the final fight.

Doctor strange’s character is way better than the movie.

Captain Marvel movie is way better than the character.

Endgame sucked.

Ok, that last one was a lie."
33128,best energy drink,"red bull, because it tastes better than coffee and I usually prefer something cold to something hot in the morning."
2442,best headphones,I just commented suggesting these too! Had my first pair for 7 years and would have used them longer if I knew I could fix them before I ordered the same model again. I don't know how you can use them for workouts but for just about anything else they're A+.
37996,best Marvel movie,I love Black Panther but thinking its better than Endgame is laughable.
3372,best webcamera,Thanks for the insight! That's helpful. Do you wanna share your stream here?
71465,best movies with a cool twist,"the plunger to the face really seals it for me.

i really can't think of another actor that could pull that off.

Jim Carrey was amazing. A 4 year run (1994-1998) of The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura 1&2, Truman Show, Liar Liar and The Cable Guy. IMO probably the best collection of quotable movies from one actor."
67806,axios alternatives reddit,"One thing I couldn't find in those other libs is time measurements of a request, although for new project If I remember correctly now I used something from 'perf_hooks', bit I feel like it's not that accurate, anyhow does a job well enough"
