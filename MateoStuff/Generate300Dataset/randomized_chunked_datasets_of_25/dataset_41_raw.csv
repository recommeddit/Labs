I have had issues with toothpicks but good idea
England players are expensive mainly because most of them play in the Premier league.
Where would you play him? 3 and 4 are occupied.
"Yes Witcher 3 is the best RPG right now (for me), i got stuck at my first playtrough at 30 % too. But you have to continue the game, unfortunately its a bit boring at some parts around 30% but it will get better"
The twist in that movie was ruined by the pre-delay trailers.

"Well, the thing is, she often wants to play when we are on our PC.  She now plays on the tablet, but mobile games are riddled with ads and cashgrabs, so i rather get her some proper gamedevice so she can play and explore in a more ""safe"" area without ads and aluring cash shops."
"It'd probably be Casey Neistat from HBO's series [The Neistat Brothers](http://www.hbo.com/#/the-neistat-brothers)

"I’m finding signing service uncover darks which say not to install on iOS 11. 

Are there older versions of UD that are recommended for Sileon on iOS 11?

Ps: what are reliable sources for the other 2?"
"It's decent. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it with a hangover yesterday. It does make you suspend disbelief a lot, but if you can get past that, it's a fun flick, especially if you know a lot of the references in it."
