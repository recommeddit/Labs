If you think that being exposed to advertising doesn’t change your spending patterns that’s on you.
"I think to be completely pure you gotta get water that’s “deionized”, at least that’s my understanding of it.

Distilling may be exactly how that’s done, but iirc they are two distinct processes, with distilling being less thorough of a purification. I’m terribly sorry but I’m far too lazy to find evidence for this currently, so drink it with a grain of salt..."
"Follow up question, how are any of these games with an Xbox controller aside from Forza?"
Yes they do
"A week trip to a ski resort in Colorado called Copper Mountain. Incredible views and weather. Unfortunately I had to go home to Arkansas, but mark my words I will move there in a few years. It was extraordinary!"
But hard for anyone to come to their house to actually play. :)
In poland there is an icecream with taste of beer. It tastes completly diffrent from accual beer but hey.
"[Arms races between and within species by Dawkins & Krebs](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=arms%20races%20between%20and%20within%20species%20filetype%3Apdf&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oeb.harvard.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fpringle%2Fjc%2FDawkins%2520and%2520Krebs1979.pdf&ei=mfe5TqHMF4Ts2QW28Ji6Bw&usg=AFQjCNEHHyHoQr1oevG3B1CVhGv5T8Tg6A&cad=rja)

They write in a very clear and eloquent style which makes difficult to grasp concepts easy to understand. Its a greatly influential paper--it has been cited nearly 1000 times in biology and life science journals. One of the best biology papers I have had the pleasure to read.

Also, a few good books, available free online:

CoMC is actually just one big book.
"Meet him aswell on my birthday in Berlin as he was with his birdhouse team for a demo there. 
Incredible how calm and nice he was for such an impactful person in the skate scene. 
Best birthday ever because I didn’t knew he was in Berlin until I arrived at the park."
"Colognes are an interesting subject because we all have a different idea of what we like or what we think smells good. I'm not a cologne expert, but I don't think I've smelled the same cologne on two different people, which I think speaks volumes about personal taste. If I were to buy a new cologne, it would be Acqua di Gio. I smelled it on a friend once and also in stores. Great from what I remember. Unfamiliar with the last two."
"Home Depot can and will offer returns/exchanges based on the credit card.  That's a nationwide policy.  If you have no receipt and you paid with cash, well.. maybe you just weren't mean to return it.  Especially after years.  I can guarantee you there is no corporate policy that says you can return items after ""years"" with no receipt.  You just got lucky with the one you live near.

All the Home Depots I've ever lived near have sold wood and trim by the foot and allowed you to cut it yourself.  Lowe's sells it by the piece.  Everything else is just about identical.  I make a lot of trips buying wood or trim so I don't even bother going by Lowe's any more."
"Not quite, but that's still a decent configuration."
"AKG K 518 LE  ~ £30 - fold up super small, hinges and headband don't break and can be used to DJ in clubs.

edit: I presume by over ear you meant ""not in ear"" not circumaural. (in my opinion supra-aural is better anyway)"

"Was very interested in how an established game like Puerto Rico could drop 21 spaces. 

[Q1 Entry](https://i.imgur.com/NWZkFit.png)

[Q2 Entry](https://i.imgur.com/HRWhLoY.png)

The description and vote totals don't seem consistent.

Edit: the links in the list indeed go to two different listings of Puerto Rico. Doesn't seem like this should be considered a true drop."
