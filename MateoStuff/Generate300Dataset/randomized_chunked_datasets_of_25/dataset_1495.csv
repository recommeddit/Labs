2766,"What about bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL?

Is there anything good out there in the price range you explored within your guide?

I was considering to get a creative BT-W2 to plug in my pc plus a pair of headphones that could benefit from that (I already have a stand alone mic for discord chats).   
Still not sure what to pick, I always used cheap headphones so far. I'd like improvement in sound quality now that I have some budget, while keeping it wireless.

&#x200B;

From your list it seems that the G935 should be my best option (the GSP670 is way out of budget, I only find them at 300/350 euros).",best headphones

I definitely expected Weghorst when De Boer started trying a 3-5-2 . The formation really fits us. World class centerbacks, wingbacks that can't really defend, solid defensive mid and then Wijnaldum+De Jong behind Weghorst+Depay. Oh well.... here comes Babel again I suppose.",best soccer team in the world

2. The chip that controls it inside the cable and the device on one end, and the power adapter on the other end.
3. If it was just plugged into a 1 Amp charger (like for Apple watch or similar) it likely would not have fried.
