17470,best iOS game,Crazy that What The Golf hasn't been mentioned. It even won Game of The Year last year.
2766,best headphones,"What about bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL?

Is there anything good out there in the price range you explored within your guide?

I was considering to get a creative BT-W2 to plug in my pc plus a pair of headphones that could benefit from that (I already have a stand alone mic for discord chats).   
Still not sure what to pick, I always used cheap headphones so far. I'd like improvement in sound quality now that I have some budget, while keeping it wireless.

&#x200B;

From your list it seems that the G935 should be my best option (the GSP670 is way out of budget, I only find them at 300/350 euros)."
45803,best trick or treating candy,Yum more for me :)
13666,best research paper archive,This is one of the reasons I gave up my dream of a career in academia. So much stress and hard work for free. Maybe when I retire or if I win the lottery I could afford to do research again...

36778,best alcoholic drink,"Long Island Iced Tea made with Sprite, add peach Shnaupps....it's a nice peachy, spritey drink"
16132,best sunglasses for fashion,"I whole heartedly second this. The basic ones are not worth it at all but the ""premium"" or whatever the better ones are called are about $5 bucks more expensive and look much much better"
26965,best board games,Curious about the large discrepancy in Terraforming Mars' position. Is the sentiment here that it's a bit overrated?
1879,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Love Petrinis !
40800,best instrument to play,"maybe keys if you’re on some kind of time constraint. you won’t have to let your fingers firm up or develops calluses. assuming you have a computer at your disposal, amazon has 49 key midi controllers for like $60 and there is a lot of free software you can use with those. And if you wanted to pick up guitar later the fundamentals of keyboard will give you a good musical foundation for other instruments. that said you’ll really only get out what you put in with any instrument. find time to practice regularly but don’t get discouraged if it takes some time."

11624,best gifts for dad,Yeah alzheimers is terrible hope yall are doing ok
58493,best cologne,I will be buying the winner. I need a new scent.
70196,best major to study in college,I'm not really sure why everyone is reading this list like a child. Obviously this list is about money and not happiness. How the hell could you write a list of the ten best and worst careers for happiness. Everyone has different things to make them happy. Nobody is telling you how to live your life.
29205,best web hosting service,I stick to DigitalOcean or other cloud’type hosting if apps built on new type like Vue or Angular because it works faster and migration is pretty simple
51280,best iphone case,any update on the pitaka case?
50475,best rap album,"I've never listened to 2001.  Idk wtf is wrong with me, I decided I must fix this today.  Gonna buy it as soon as I'm done with school for the day"
66426,best soccer team in the world,"The fact that we still regularly have to watch De Jong and Babel in the national team with Weghorst just sitting at home is a fucking crime against football lol. He might not start every game because Depay is our best player when playing as a striker, but still. 

I definitely expected Weghorst when De Boer started trying a 3-5-2 . The formation really fits us. World class centerbacks, wingbacks that can't really defend, solid defensive mid and then Wijnaldum+De Jong behind Weghorst+Depay. Oh well.... here comes Babel again I suppose."
47114,best state to visit in the United States,"Oh quality cheers I will have a watch. I like Stephen Fry too, he is pretty funny."
53428,best usb c charging cable,"1. Better wire thickness to handle the higher amperage of fast charge.
2. The chip that controls it inside the cable and the device on one end, and the power adapter on the other end.
3. If it was just plugged into a 1 Amp charger (like for Apple watch or similar) it likely would not have fried. But the phone called for fast charge because it talked to the power adapter with quick charge 3.0 and the cable said ""sure dude, whatever you say"" and boom. Thin wires not capable of the job"
58009,best cologne,"Same, wtf? Advertising is getting smarter"
36081,best alcoholic drink,YOUR TIME HAS COME
34601,best NFL player,"Rice had a HOF WR next to him for 6 years (T.O and then Tim Brown). Carter and Moss played together for 4 years. Rice also had great receiving threats on his earlier teams, thats why those 49er teams were so good. Roger Craig was putting up WR1 reception numbers, John Taylor."
