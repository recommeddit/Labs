37699,"I think these two movies contrast each other really effectively around one point: neither main character has an arc, and it's brilliant in one and boring in the other.

The Russo's talked about how Winter Soldier was a hard movie to pitch because Steve doesn't really have an arc in it. He doesn't really change as a character, he reacts to his world changing around him. But holy shit does it change, every single act of the movie something radically changes about Steve's world. The movie hits the ground running in the opening scene and never stops until the end. So it works brilliantly.

In the Dark World, Thor doesn't really have an arc either. He doesn't really change, but his world doesn't really change either until literally like ***the last ten minutes of the movie***. They open with what is essentially the ending of a way more interesting Thor movie and then they just fart around for a while and throw in a status quo change at the very end, when the movie has no real time to explore it. So the whole thing just feels a bit useless.",best Marvel movie

I was in a triple as well and was a CS major so I was close to all my classes.  Santa Cruz was pretty much the same as far as I could tell.  Also as far as getting to IV have a few drinks in your room before heading out and the 15 or 20 minute walk to IV is nothing, also campus is pretty cool at night.  If you long board Anacapa is a couple minutes from some great spots, I don't know if they have cracked down since I left or not but we used to go to the engineering parking lot late at night and skate there for hours.

It’s unclear whether Amazon is able to retroactively trace the source of the inventory in the absence of stickers, but that program was clearly not thought through, just another example of Amazon turning a blind eye on counterfeiting. Whether this is deliberate or not is open to question.

Your faith in Amazon is misplaced, there are certainly reports of counterfeiting on Amazon orders:
