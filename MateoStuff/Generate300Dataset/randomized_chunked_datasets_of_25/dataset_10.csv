Yup, me too. If you're not starting with a fairly spicy stew, you'll probably need to adjust the seasonings a bit. Oatmeal's bland."

11575,best gifts for dad,"Not sure if this counts because he doesn't really ""use"" it like a tool, but I'm in a ""father's day"" mood (I just went looking a few hours ago) and have a really cute story about my dad's favorite father's day gift

Context: I was always a... strange kid about money and presents. Like, I used to get *seriously* depressed that I couldn't buy my parents ""real"" gifts- I'd get stressed out and nearly cry over it (I'm still like that a bit tbh, couldn't tell ya why). This was when I was in elementary school.

So, one summer break when I was about 10yo, I was going to day camp. Now, father's day had already passed, and I was still reeling from my residual ""not getting him a ""real"" gift"" emotions (despite repeated assurances that it was perfectly alright). One day, one of the camp activities was woodburning. I decided that I ""could get dad a real present!"". Since he's a huge Denver Broncos fan, I found the right stencil to make him a horse. 

That thing *sucked ass*. The burning was uneven, and the lines were so thick that you could barely tell what it was. I tried to sign my name at the bottom, and it was so light that you couldn't read the last half. Nonetheless, I was proud of my first ""real gift"" (not a card), gave it to him after camp, and was content.

Fast forward a few years: it's father's day and I'm playing around with some ideas, maybe some Broncos merch... How about something for his car! I go to ask: ""Nope, I've already got something. Remember the Bronco you made me?"" I laugh about that crap thing, and ask if he would like some *real* merch. ""It *is* real"". 

To this day, the man won't budge. My mom and I have both bought him all sorts of team-related items, from all his favorite teams. But he won't accept anything for his car.

A few months ago he got a new car, and brought all his junk inside. He left it right on the counter- I thought he was finally gonna throw it out. Nope- the second he brought the new car home, he walked in, grabbed that horrible excuse for a horse, and proudly but it back where it had been in the old car.

TL;DR: My dad refuses to put any other team merch in his car- apperently, I've got it covered."
