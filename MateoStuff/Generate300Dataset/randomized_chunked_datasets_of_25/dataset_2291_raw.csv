"I like so many different drinks it's hard to decide and stick with one for the night, lol.

My favourites are:

* Früli (strawberry Belgian beer)
* Blonde Leffe (Belgian beer)
* Baileys Irish Cream (liqueur - I like it straight over ice)
* Honey Dew Golden Ale
* Strawberry and lime Kopparberg (Swedish cider)
* Prosecco
* Pinot grigio
* Strawberry Daiquiri"
"Pink came on holiday in 2010 to island I was living/working on. She came into the pub and just hung out like a regular person. People asked for autographs, she chatted with people as if they were new friends, played pool for about three hours. Three of my friends jokingly asked is she'd like to come to their party they were having in their room that night (thinking she would decline). She said she would love to hang out with some of the staff that work on the island. She turned up and stayed for about an hour. 

I don't personally like her music, but when she comes in and acts like a regular person with no stupid demands and even goes to a random party, she is alright by me."
"RPG has broadened its meaning lately so of you can customise a character with stats, outfits, weapons and that kind of thing then it's usually classed as an RPG. I know RPG's are usually used for fantasy world's and stuff like Witcher but I'd still say they fall under it as well since you role play as Spider-Man and Deacon in a zombie world."
"The antihistamine doesn't stop the draining, it stops the production of new mucus. Even after you stop new mucus, you need to get the existing gunk out. That's what the combo of anti-histamine + NSAID + decongestant does. It's commonly packaged together, for example, Claritin D is loratadine + pseudoephedrine (anti-histamine, decongestant). Advil allergy + congestion is chlorpheniramine + ibuprofen + phenylephrine (anti-histamine, NSAID, decongestant).  Some also include caffeine since that speeds up the effectiveness."
The Grand Canyon is amazing
"Oh yeah, I went through a lock picking phase.  It passed, but I still love watching [TheLockpickingLawyer](https://youtu.be/k9VewWKfH_0)."
Don't give out masturbations ok?

A large can of beef stew and a large bottle of [C-Boost.](http://leewochner.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cboost_back.jpg)  I'm better in less than 24hrs.
It's hard to press charges on your own Grandma.
"Depends when they were built. The only Intamin hyper in the chain(Superman the Ride) was still the best ride in the chain even like after El Toro and Tatsu were built...

But then the new restraints came and the ride isn't the award winner it used to be."
"Gotcha.  Good money in that industry, but sort of dangerous on the drilling rigs, no?"
Doubt it. Apocalypse has been closed. Saw they were doing some track work/inspections.
It is maintained by Offensive Security which is responsible for the most renowned certs in the field. That gives it the boost in popularity.
JotL has 25 scenarios versus Gloomhaven’s ~100 scenarios. It’s very much just a shorter campaign with the same gameplay/depth as Gloomhaven. I think it’s a perfect primer for Frosthaven.
"I think one of the guitars is probably easiest to learn (bass or acoustic guitar), but I think learning the piano first will teach you the most about music, theory wise and whatnot."
"The curse of Oldschool ""we wont hand you anything"" games is real."
"Not a fragrance expert but I did like it for a while - its definitely a strong woody smell but the thing is its a very synthetic wood smell. Many people still like it though so I would recommend getting a sample to at least try it.

I tried slumberhouse norne and I liked the earthy/mossy wood smell over wonderwood"
"Can you link me with a recommended cable, please?"
"I've always thought Tendulkar was overrated. Great batsman, sure, but he was outperformed by batsmen such as Kallis in my opinion, despite batting on a lot of Indian roads. He was a more exciting player than Kallis, who was a wall, which is why I think people rate him more highly than they should."
"I wish lists like this were broken down by era - classics, modern, new - to allow for more movement in the upper slots (getting away from Asimov, Bradbury, etc.)."
"I was wondering if people still read Georgette. She was my gateway drug as well - also via Friday's Child.  Still the best for quality romance, IMHO."
lol I can imagine but I don't wear as much perfume anymore. And when I do no one complains. My husband can smell it sometimes. I still don't think it's that powerful on me.
The last guy is looking up.
