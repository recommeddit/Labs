21952,best celebrity,"Really the only answer is the chin nod at that time of day. I used to see famous people in NYC when I lived there in my 20's. I made a point to use the chin nod all the time, I would never, ever say a word to them. That's until I saw Sean Penn piss on a fire hydrant and I had to yell out, ""Nice dick!"" At least I think it was him, the group I was in seemed to agree."

3112,best webcamera,"One reason among several: because COVID19. When you sell every single webcam in existence, at whatever price you want, and still can't cover most of the demand... why bother making them better?

Outside of this, the usual pretext is ""customers don't care about webcams"". Which is absolutely untrue, but the way they ask the question in studies/surveys is wrong and lead to this assumption."

I'm not?

> If you want to use Chrome and give Google the entirety of your information and online activity, go ahead.

I don't? I use Vivaldi.

> Just stop lying and creating problems you don't have to discredit Firefox. 

I'm actually telling the truth. I'm not trying to discredit Firefox. I love Firefox. It just has too many issues *for me personally* to use it as my daily driver.

This is an objectively false statement. 

Maybe don't go around assuming you know everything about everyone and every situation."
