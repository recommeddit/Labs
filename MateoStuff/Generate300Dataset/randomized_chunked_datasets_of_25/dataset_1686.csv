10276,best suitcase lock,"That's if they need to open them without you. Mine get opened very rarely, and when they have they've always just asked for a key."
70804,best movies with a cool twist,"Since the trailer for the remake just came out, how about 1990s Jacob's Ladder? 

Avoid all spoilers for that one, go in as blind as possible."
12896,best gifts for mom,">a day of whatever she wants just so she doesn't have to clean up after 2 grown men. She's very excited.

This is pretty sad. Maybe you need to have a chat with your brother and father about not taking advantage of her and acting like the grown-ass men that they are."

12888,best gifts for mom,"Yes. That's exactly right. Mother's Day is supposed to be about recognizing all the crap that we deal with 364 days of the year. The best way to recognize that is to get rid of it for us, if only or a day."

32592,best vacation resort,"Vacations to go agents are some of the most helpful and knowledgeable people to use.  Excellent down to earth people and pretty good rates.  www.funjet.com is an excellent source for resorts as well. 

Source: I work in the travel industry (not at vtg or funjet) 

Also, buy travel insurance!! Especially if you are leaving the country as your medical plan probably only covers you domestically."

I'd love to know what it was but it felt weird I was even talking to Steven Tyler, I couldn't imagine the awkwardness of asking why he smelled so yummy."
42452,movies like Inception,"Sucker punch is a giant piece of shit. A big idea director who can't execute a movie with depth on any level without making it boring, dry, and all around uninteresting disaster. Man of Steel too.

Tl:dr Snyder is a hack for babies"
64595,Best Nike running shoes,I posted on the Sunday question forum about the Pegasus turbos- I just got them for some speed work sessions and was nervous cause after my first little 30min interval my legs felt like they took the brunt. Lovely poster responded maybe I tied them off ? So gonna adjust that but now I’m weary about them - getting injured. My legs felt “shock” little pain in left toes. I usually wear cushioning brooks do you feel like it’s just a case of getting used to a different shoe? I was a little faster as a side note so they’re like a tease right now and I don’t know what to do! Just don’t want any injuries you know especially from wearing the wrong shoe ?
