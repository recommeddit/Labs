"No, but a left and a right can give you a decent average for the middle."
Perfectberry Rockstar... miss it to this day
"Default samsung? Ditch that shit man, that's what Android is for :D"
"Do you need ssd/hdd, ram, case and psu as well?"
I don't think I saw Eden Roc or Cap Estel here yet.
"I'd suspect that if you find a nice rug that you love first, it could really tie the whole room together."
Ukulele all the way!!!!!
"Here are a few extras for you to watch if you like these sorts of films:

1. Coherence.  A darling of the Reddit crowd, and it deserves the love.  A great and cheap little film.

2. The One I Love.  A great little known film shot almost exclusively at Ted Danson's house.

3. The Thomas Crown Affair.  The remake."
Do you have a recommendation?
Groot!
"That's what I ordered.  The clear one on my 11 Pro Max is just fine, only a minor crack near the bottom from me taking it off to clean it."
"I would recommend:

1. Persona 5 (Persona 5 Royal, if you can wait 1.5 months for its release)
2. Final Fantasy XII
3. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel trilogy"
I got the LG 27GN850. Itâ€™s the same IPS Panel as the Dell and was significantly cheaper as it was on sale at my local Best Buy. Iâ€™m overall happy with it

"**Trees:**

Cercis canadensis - pink or white flowers in spring, several have purple foliage, turns yellow in fall.

Acer rubrum - several cultivars have great shape, bright red/orange foliage in fall.

Ginkgo biloba - unique leaf shape that grows on entire stem, bright yellow in fall. ONLY BUY MALE PLANT, prolific female fruit smells like dog shit!

Liquidambar styraciflua - star-shaped leaves, turns bright red, purple, or yellow in fall.

_________________________

**Large Shrubs**

Cornus sericea - Several cultivars with white variegated foliage, bright red or yellow stems in winter.

Ilex verticillata - Covered in bright red or orange berries all winter, bird friendly. Requires 1 male per 3-5 female plants.

Sambucus nigra - almost black dissected foliage, white flowers in early summer.

Amelanchier canadensis - white flowers in early summer, edible berries mid-late summer (taste like blueberries, birds love them), excellent red/orange/yellow fall colour."
"As someone will surely bring up: the black suit gave Peter a new sense of confidence that led to unwarranted self-importance. This self-importance manifested itself in his cringey, emo interactions in that scene. The movie intentionally made him look like an idiot because he was being one.

Whether or not that's good or not is debatable. But some people didn't think the directors knew how awkward that scene came across. Of course they did. That was the intention."
"My mate watched it the night before and told me that the twist ending was amazing. Sat down and watched it with him and about 5 minuets before I clocked it, was sat there with my head in my hands just waiting, brilliant film."
"I would say itâ€™s good! Iâ€™ve dropped it several times and havenâ€™t had any issues. Maybe just some scratches to the screen but my phone has so many now that it doesnâ€™t bother me. It also isnâ€™t super grippy, it easily slides out of my hand so that could be something to keep in mind if youâ€™re more clumsy. I would like to get it again but itâ€™s not available on Amazon for me so Iâ€™m thinking of going with the rugged armor for now.

Edit: mine is for the 7 plus, looking at the newer ones it looks like theyâ€™ve added grip to the sides which mine doesnâ€™t have so Iâ€™d imagine it would be a bit better than what I currently have."
Nah bruh you gotta listen to billy woods in the gym if you wanna post on here
"As far as I could tell from interviews, Mef is the nicest man in the world. Nice to see that it's actually true."
Because they'll come out when you're old anyway
"If you ever drive a car, get polarized lenses. They will make driving during the day significantly safer as they will greatly reduce glare from the sun and reflections, making it easier to see the road and focus.

Don't even consider non-polarized lenses. They're not worth even the $5."
