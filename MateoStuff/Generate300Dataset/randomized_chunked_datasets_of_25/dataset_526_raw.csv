The Sinner Season 1 Netflix
Serial Experiments Lain. Not really a movie but a 13 episode anime.
my dumbass forgot WF and I was just playing it the other day lmao
"I'd also like to express my appreciation for the series.   I'm listening to the audiobooks, since I have precious little time for actual reading these days, and am eagerly awaiting my next audible credit to get the next book. Only have made it through the first book, and he two shorts ""Jester"" & ""Professional Integrity,"" but can already tell it's going to end up being one of my new favorite series. I might have to breakdown next payday and buy the next one outright!"
I agree he was an amazing actor and his character was so good
"Pretty sure this list should be nothing but Thunderstruck, over and over and over again. I'm even a little upset they picked Back in Black as #1 over Thunderstruck."
"> musk

A strong-smelling reddish-brown substance that is secreted by the male musk deer for scent-marking and is an important ingredient in perfumery."
"Some of my favorite albums this year are

* Tru Carr - Based On A TRU Story
* ALLBLACK - TY4FWM
* Drakeo The Ruler - The Truth Hurts
* The Alchemist - This Thing of Ours
* Shelly FKA DRAM - Self Titled

Favorite verse is Boldy James on TV Dinners

> Blew a fifty on a Dwele, with girly out in LA

> Tryna stick me, gotta get up earlier than Thebe

> Goyard skully, gazin' at the stars in the Culli'

> It's still Hell Block hully-gully

> Gift wrap them brickies then we kidnap them slippies

> Forties on deck like a six-pack of mickeys

> Name heavy in the street as a rose gold Phillipe

> Came fully AP'd, now I need a Richie

> Wasn't takin' 'til I hit it with the G-rizzy

> Watched it come together, full circle, did a 360

> Cut it with the lactose and get a free fifty

> Reekin' of second-hand crack smoke and cheap whiskey

> Ghost Glock on my waist, made a killin' off the noise

> Block so hot, got the paint peelin' off the walls

> Quarter, half brick, whole brick, I can move it all

> Auntie want it quick, gettin' sick, goin' through withdrawals

> Where we at?

Something about Boldy's delivery that I love. Last year he became my favorite member on Griselda and I guess it's going to keep continuing to be that way.

Edit: I lied. My favorite verse is Jay on 'What It Feels Like' 

> Scorpion bricks, way before Aubrey's double disc

> .40 on my lap, clap, sound like 40 did the mix

And 

> You let them crackers storm your Capitol, put they feet up on your desk

> And yet you talkin' tough to me, I lost all my little respect

Most disappointing albums this year?

Benny the Butcher & Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2. 

On paper it should be a classic, but it's forgettable for me. I've only gone back to it twice. Don't know why it didn't stick for me."
"I haven't read the series yet, I have two of them though & plan to get to them soon (my TBR is huge).
I hope your book club loves it! I recommended it to mine too when it was on sale last month and my BFF read it and liked it but nobody else has given feedback yet."
"They didnt forget, Peter was just being responsible and focusing on stopping the lizard, The pacing honest to god was not bad, I thought the pacing would be bad on my 2nd rewatch but for some reason it built up good, If only the deleted scenes wernt taken out"
"Ah yes I skipped over that sentence by accident because i was skimming, but generally speaking yeah I know what you mean, 90% of the twitch population shouldnt spend if you dont have any particular goal or the cash to spend on those parts."

Try liquid helium
"Wait, this has a name? I just used to say I was a monster hunter. When asked about it I would ask if they saw any monsters around and then say 'You're Fucking Welcome.' Not sure where I got it from."
Does Sensodyne really work?
I’m surprised to see Shoujo Kakumei Utena so high up since I never heard of it I’m probably going to watch it later
A clock that had pictures of all her children and grandchildren on the hours
"I don't know how I didn see this,  becaus I could actually but just needed the to hear the truth haha"
top man thank you legend!
"Noone's mentioned the *real* reputation for NZ -- the 'dibbly dobbly' bowler (eg. Gavin Larsen, early CZ Harris, I reckon G Elliot's up there too)."
Titanic
"Your ""fast food burger"" analogy was spot on. It was interesting and entertaining but not thought provoking like Dune or the Hyperion Cantos series.....at least in my opinion."
"box o' wine, pour tap directly into mouth

that's the way to do it"
"Idk about that, Cedar Point took their worst two rides and made one tolerable and the other one of the best rides on the planet while at the same time building two new shiny B&Ms and renovating entire areas of the park with them. That doesn't count the work on the resorts and water park they've put in."
"Yeah wide gamut is beneficial if you're doing real colour work and can calibrate it to actually properly display 100% srgb, otherwise at the very least you need a decent srgb mode on the monitor"
