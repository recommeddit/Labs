31337,best country to live in,"Long story short: I came to Fargo for a regular high school exchange program because the spots in Canada were already filled up, and (for a number of reasons) I ended up sticking around for a college degree afterwards. I'm graduating next month, and after one year of OPT (effectively a work visa), I'll finally be free again. [Free, free at last.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb0-Opnx4Kk)"

72249,best adblocker extension,Good to know. Ublock really is the best at blocking ads and even if some ads get thruogh u can just post it here on the subreddit or on github and ull find some solution or it will be fixed in the next update as gorhill is very active at making it better and u can also use the dev version of u block for some extra features tho i wouldnt recommend it as it is a dev vrsion and is prone to bugs so its better to use the normal stable release and just make sure its updated to the latest stable version

22606,best celebrity,"I have a similar story, my brother caddied for Jordan when he was in high school. Now I live in Chicago and this was during the mid to late 90's, a time when MJ could have pretty much killed someone during a live televised press conference and gotten away with it. Jordan never said a word to my brother, other than a direct order, and when he was finished he told my brother that his tip was caddying for him."
45472,best gaming system,"Easy way to get around region lock, just change your country or play offline. When the US had indie games I changed to US and if i wanted midnight releases back then I used to set to NZ"
16796,best pet for toddlers,"Personally, I wouldn't recommend getting a dog right now. *Any* dog, regardless of breed, will require at least sixty minutes of physical and mental exercise a day, and at least three more hours for training/socialization/management during the first few months at home. Most of the qualities that you are looking for are depend more on how well you train and socialize the dog than on breed. So I'd *highly* recommend waiting until you have done at least six more months of research before adopting a dog, but I'm sure you'll be overwhelmed by then (don't worry! I can be pretty lazy too!). Don't get me wrong, dog's are incredible animals, but I think a cat would be better suited for your situation. He/she would require less physical and mental stimulation, could be house trained indoors, and you could even take him/her for occasional walks on leash. 

I like the general rule of waiting to get a dog until you can look in the mirror and honestly say that you know everything there is to know about raising your new companion, because even then you aren't fully prepared. 

Best of luck!"
55164,best places to hike in the east coast,The spot where this photo was taken is called Indian Head. The peaks we did are Colvin & Blake. There are camping sites there (and all over the Adis) that I highly recommend. A good amount of campers (not too many nor too few) which makes it ideal.
