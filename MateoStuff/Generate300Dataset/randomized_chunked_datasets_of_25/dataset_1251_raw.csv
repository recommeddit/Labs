"Good advice for domestic travel, but far more trouble and expense for international."
"Scallop.  Only had it the once,but it was scrumptious!  Kind of like a mildly sweet, creamy, seafood soup, but cold and in a cone."
Do people shoot randomly in the street like in the news?
Mint chocolate chip. It's refreshing and delicious. Plus I crave it every month and it helps me feel less crappy.

"It's not just the ads. You can also customize/modify app features you don't like.

Example 1: I'm still using Yahoo webmail. Their current design hogs space on the right for ads and for icons for address book and calendar. Not too bad on a widescreen, but my favorite laptop has an old 1024x68, 4:3 screen. This left very little space for the actual email list or text. Using the simple point-and-click element picker made it easy to hide the screen hogs. (When I need to access the Address Book, I simply disable uBO.

Example 2: I have never been a Facebook subscriber, but I occasionally need to look at a Facebook page. A couple of clicks made the intrusive ""Join or Login"" overlay go away. This was a need that Facebook users would never ask for.

Example 3: This one does not apply to me. Facebook users often seem to request their specific preferences: Hide this feed or that news or whatever that other users would not wish to hide. There always seems to be a way to do it and satisfy that individual need."
"And just erroneous sometimes. Reading that little ""clarifications and corrections"" box inside the front page makes me wonder how they ever got away with printing it in the first place."
"I haven’t had the pleasure of visiting Santa Barbara recently given the ongoing apocalypse, but for me it’s definitely nostalgia. It was the place to hang out for the SBCC Computer Club in the ‘80s. Fun times. And yes, I’m an old geek."
"It doesn’t seem to be too popular in South Africa, but I guess it’s really popular overseas"
"Breaking someone's nose...

Maybe you could have explained how much it meant to you and they would have apologized as they realized what they said."

"This is true. Mint Oreo is delicious but I still just say MCC is my favorite. Though, you're right. Oreo is definitely the clear winner."
i hope ur joking
The reason turbo is not looked upon favorably is because it was basically tm2 but they removed the parts that the openess of PC would allow for. The reason is that they needed to consolify the experience for well... The consoles as no other trackmania game had been released on consoles before and they wanted to enter that market. So ya TM2 is where it's at with the community and leverages PC as a more open platform. Tho you will be missing out on lagoon environment.

"Yes, indentured labourers were introduced to Trinidad & Tobago over 200 centuries ago after slavery was abolished in 1834. Mostly low caste folks were taken and worked just as hard as slaves, but got their land, small money and had their freedom. 

Now in Trinidad, Indians are the majority at the last census count I believe. And we watch Bollywood films, celebrate Divali, perform poojas and created a twist to some of the indian cuisine, while still having traditional foods and snacks (barfi, kurma, jellaby). 

It's very interesting, though has also created race relation problems to those of African decent (aka former slaves). It doesn't go well with all the classism that occurs on the small island."

"I used to work in a cafe in a very small town in New Zealand around 10 years ago. Billy Connolly was doing a tour of New Zealand - his wife is a Kiwi and he's well documented as loving the place - and was around the town I was working in.

He strolls into my cafe ten minutes before closing, asking if we're still open. I stand there dumbfounded, and just about swore in his face, thinking ""Holy shit, you're Billy Connolly, of course we're open"".

He was an absolute delight; beyond polite, sat and chatted with a table of local ladies, and roared with laughter when they said he should've had his coffee for free (""I could buy the place if I wanted to, why wouldn't I pay for my coffee""). He is everything I aspire to be as a human - kind, jovial, hilarious, and clever."
