I would add trace minerals if you had one. Or get a Berkey.
"Yeah, that what I wanted to validate. It may be an unpopular opinion but I always wonder why Ann Leckie got so many awards, I thought it might be because of how she writes about genders. The trilogy is good but that many awards...?"
"Pel√©'s Santos only won two Libertadores, mind.

Pe√±arol won it three times in the sixties and beat Real Madrid and Benfica in the Intercontinental Cup back when european teams cared about it.

Independiente (Ag√ºero's childhood club) won it SEVEN times, and four of those were in consecutive years on the seventies.

South American football has a great history, sadly we started selling our best players to europe and then we never looked back... I would give anything to see the kind of teams that my dad told me about."
"there are literally 10 superchargers between Chicago and Detroit. That's a short stop to go to the bathroom, buy a snack, stretch your legs, and you are back at enough charge to not worry about it."

"I'm not a photographer / don't use these for anything other than my phone -- EDC I carry the Anker Powercore II 10000 upgraded Poweriq 2.0, for anything more than a day I carry that and the Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000, Portable Charger 5000mAh 2-in-1 with Dual USB Wall Charger, Foldable AC Plug and PowerIQ (copied the names from my Amazon orders list).

Neither have let me down; they've always gotten me through tight spots, but also to be honest I've very lightly used the second one / it's become more of a backup that stays in the hotel room. The first has gotten heavy heavy use in all settings in a bunch of countries. With COVID I also stopped traveling and forgot about them, found them in my bag recently and tested their battery levels, still held a charge."

"I totally 2nd this 

The floors are so dark it can be really easy to make the room dark as well, depending on the furniture. 

I‚Äôd stick with white and use artwork to make the walls interesting"

"5 of the lists had a single entry for ""Clannad"", but mentioned both seasons.  One list said ""Clannad"" but had a link to After Story.  There were also 2 polls that just said ""Clannad"" without specifying if they meant the franchise or the first season.

I thought it would be redundant to have 2 Clannad entries, when the original lists only had 1 Clannad entry, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for the first season.  Maybe I'll change it to After Story in the next update, but it won't make a big difference, because it'll still be close to the middle of the top 100."
"Yeah that was pretty much it. I mean it works, if you're not an  e-thot or hardcore streamer what more do you really need. Pretty sure it can work with most cameras as long as it has the HDMI output"
