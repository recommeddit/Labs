Can we use this while building chrome extensions? i.e make chrome extension UI call pages asynchronously with async/await?
"Open Your Eyes but that's in Spanish so if you can only watch movies spoken in English, watch Vanilla Sky."
I actually didn't steal it. I've been saying that since I was in high school. (7 yrs. ago)
"If you liked Lucifer's Hammer check out  
**Dies The Fire by SM Stirling** - start of a long series, becomes more fantasy later, but this book is a great look at what would happen if technology just stopped.  
**The Peshawar Lancers - also by Stirling** - a slightly steam punk exploration of what happens when a comet hits in the Victorian era and what results."

"Thank you, kind redditor!"
Wow... thatâ€™s a really high quality video for someone with such pants-crappingly insane theories.
"A Teaching Degree. I have always been great with kids, most of my childhood, I was always the oldest. and I like to help people"
"Noise cancelling headphones (Anker Soundcore Q20 from Amazon for about $70). I am so easily distracted by noise, it blocks out my neighbours using the leafblower for an hour, the central heating noise, mutes conversation so it's less distracting. Has made working from home infinitely better and would be great if I was sharing an office one day too. 

6ft unbreakable phone charger, so I can use my phone while it charges and I don't have to replace the cable every 3 months.

Chromecast ~$30. So easy to stream anything to my tv and I can still use my phone at the same time unlike Apple tv mirroring. I can even load a YouTube video for my cat and then leave the house.

A good pillow, and although it was a little over $100, a memory foam mattress topper. My body stopped hurting.

A fire alarm (free). In most developed countries, you can book your local fire department to come and install a new fire alarm for free. Previous tenants took it off for parties and my landlady isn't very responsive and I didn't want to pay for a new one myself but also I didn't want to burn to death in my sleep."
"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is good, but most all colleges use MS Windows to teach C++ and Java programming. The senior could be pulling your leg!  If you have plenty of room on your hard drive, read up on Ubuntu and then install it. Beware that when using Firefox in Windows it's 32 bit and may offer you the 32 bit iso even if you have a 64 bit processor. IF you have a 64 bit processor, get the 64 bit iso. 4 gb of ram is ok, 8 or 16 gigs of ram is better if you are going to compile programs - but that also depends on your hardware. Use the Ubuntu iso to create a bootable usb flash drive (stick) boot it up, do not install just to test and check it out first. Search and read about UEFI or EFI (if you have it, ck your BIOS) on the ubuntu site.  Good luck!"
This was my daily for a while. Pretty much all YSL are legit.
"I always hear younger blue collar workers say how they enjoy their jobs and are fulfilled by the work and pay. Then every 50-60 year old welder or plumber is the first to grab you by both your shoulders and give you an intense, grizzled look and say ""Son, don't do this for a living. Go to school and get paid to use your brain."""
Pegasus 36 can be found for about $70 on eastbay and Vomero 14 for $76 on nike.
"I've been to Six. Going to SFGAdv this Summer. 

1. SFOG - With the ride collection and quality of SFGAm, the theming, landscape, and beauty of SFOT, and having my favorite roller coaster Goliath, this one tops it all. 

2. SFOT - The theming, interconnected-ness with the environment and landscape, and just an overall beautiful park with plenty of rides.

3. SFFT - Beautiful park with fun themed areas and a unique setting, and Iron Rattler is amazing. 

4. SFGAm - So many rides, but it's the second most Six-Flags-y out of these. (First is SFMM) 

5. SFStL - Quaint, cute, hilly, and comfy. A great collection of woodies, friendly staff, and just a cozy park with fun rides. Just not as much to do as the other parks, hence its low placement. 

6. SFMM - Terrible experience at this park. If you wanna know the story, ask."

"Omg Chloe original was the greatest, along with Chloe Narcisse. I'm gutted they discontinued them, I'm still trying to find a replacement for them."
"Microsoft's Lifecams are a decent budget option, but the detail to look for is the webcam's resolution."
"I feel like a some of the problem with this list is that some of these reviewers might not have played the game and thus don't have a ranking? Its hard to tell from top 100s.

&#x200B;

Edit: I just realized it was you who made the list, what do you think of that problem?"

I bet for Vin it was probably refreshing to have a casual conversation with someone about a personal hobby that didn't center around his celebrity status.
"Yeah Roku's pretty flexible that way. I'm kinda starting to sound like a fanboy in this thread, but it just works really well for my tastes and needs. YMMV."

"I got my dad a bottle of port for $17. If he is a whiskey drinker I would recommend Woodford Reserve or maybe whiskey stones.

Get him something for his desk at work or home: business card holder, a handmade dish for keys or change, a framed photo.

For his car: a seat cushion?

For his workout: bluetooth headphones, a gym bag, a fast drying gym towel."
