"**The Pickleback**

Sounds disgusting, tastes amazing, the most dangerous drink on the planet due to how fast and thoughtlessly they can be consumed.  I haven't been as drunk the night I was shown it since before they banned all the fun energydrink booze; **you have been warned**.

**•1 shot Jameson Whiskey** (or any whiskey)
**•1 shot kosher dill pickle brine** (that's the juice in the jar)
**Drink them, in that order.**  The brine shot is like a MrClean magic eraser for your tongue.  
(Don't mess up the order or use the wrong pickles, it will be gross!)
I always have to do one with the person I show them to, they always think it's a trick."

The fact that he spoke for 5 minutes and for that alone kept Indianapolis from rioting when MLK was assassinated says all that needs to be said about him. Only major city to not do so I think. His death is my biggest realistic what if to American history.

Maxios.
"Same director, character artist, and studio. Madoka Magica is basically Hidamari Sketch + Urobuchi."

Well said. I personally enjoy the mixed environments the most. I use VS Code with their (excellent) Vim plugin.
I like to read The Independent on those long train journeys...
"David Hyde Pierce, the act who played Niles, does a lot of outstanding physical comedy on the show."
"I currently use a phillips electric brush that vibrates, is this more effective than my traditional manual brush?  What brushing techniques do you suggest?"
"Did they like that, when you beat them off, with a stick?"
Nah. I just want you to admit that you're a shitty person.
If I was to name a great scifi from recently I'd say Ancilliary Justice.
Shitrus. Mmm
"I love my DT990 pro.

But i think its not all about headphones. If you want to use them on a PC you definitley need a sound card or desk amp"
"I concur. I ran into Nick (former owner) in the dog park several years ago. We ended up chatting for a while bc our dogs got along. He is a very NY Italian man. When he told me he had a pizza place in town, that was all I needed to know. A little expensive but definitely the only NY pizza here."
"CTRL + F ""ABBA"" no results... Guess nobody else likes to lift to Dancing Queen at 5:30am"
