One can indeed bounce on their boy's dick for hours to it.
Put Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2 on PS2. Great RPG games.
Evidence that the south is better
"I sampled Philosykos and absolutely fell in love, but I don't have money for that lol. Got ea green tea and fig hoping it would be similar but it's not at all. GT and fig is sharp and sour to me and gave me a headache, had to return. Philosykos is fresh, green, milky sweet fig."
"Washington, DC has a lot of that. Food carts might not be ""on every block,"" but they are around (and well-known and loved by locals), and you can definitely find excellent cheap food from immigrant cultures.

Corner stores, not so much, though, certainly not in the way, say, Paris does. American cities tend to be much more forcefully divided between residential and commercial than European cities."
"The Helios 300 has better cooling + a better screen, which I think is worthwhile for most people. The extra storage is helpful."
"I knew Rose was the villain too, but I wanted a subversion. I wanted a light at the end of the tunnel, but what we got was worse."
Praise Jesus and so forth that you didn't die. Holy shit!
Fond memories of someone sticking the hose in their mouth and then turning it on full blast and making it come out their nose.
"I’ve just looked at Diablo 3, and I’m not too keen on them types of RPG, prefer the Witcher style. 

Would you say FF15 is closer to the Witcher style, or Diablo style? 

Also, people say ‘pre FF13’ - why? Is there a change"
Wish my wife knew how to run plumbing!
"I'm female, but this is me. I have a pile of nice scarves and jewelry-- some of it expensive-- just sitting in a dresser drawer, because it's not really my taste. People always say ""let me know if you don't like it"" but when my aunt hands me the fancy bracelet she bought on her trip to Italy I'm not gonna be like ""yo, fuck this!"" 

On the other hand I have a ton of kitschy bobble heads and bottle openers and mugs  that people have given me here and there, and I love them all."
"2 poached eggs, 1 piece of toast, quick, easy, healthy, and delicious!"
Could you specify what you liked about those films in a general statement?  Direction? Photography? Score? Atmosphere?  Otherwise you're going to end up with suggestions that only include a super cool plot twist and crazy damaged protagonist.
Is skydiving really where you want to pinch pennies?
"Gruel.

Iceland."
Kimpton on Grand Cayman is not one of those all inclusive places but worth a visit. I don't see the appeal of all inclusive anyway.
whaaaa?!?!? Tell me more. I was just thinking about how a briny taste could maybe work if paired with something else.
No you were saying that by implying that playing for a long time means that you will shatter numerous significant records. And Deberg may have broken the interception percentage record I'm not sure. Anyway my point was Jerry Rice broke those records because he was great. Not only because he played for a long time.
"it's usually not necessary to keep james bond out, but only to be a harder target than the next suitcase for some asshat looking for a free ipad."
"A friend of mine is a police officer and she's getting her B.S. in something criminology related from Kaplan.  As far as I know she's set to get promoted after getting her degree or something.

Good luck to you!  My suggestion would be to network with classmates/professors at Kaplan, see what they can do for you in your area in terms of getting real work experience or job placement.  Seriously, I wish you the best of luck, it's tough when you get shot down without even being given a chance."
