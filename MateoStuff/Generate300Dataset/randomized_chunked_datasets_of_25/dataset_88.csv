29835,best money managing app,"I've tried YNAB and thought it was a great app; however, I like the simplicity of the EveryDollar app.  I can link all my accounts and then the app pulls in transactions from those accounts.  Then I simply slide them over to the appropriate category.  You can also manually add cash transactions, add balances for your debts, track savings, and add goals.  It usually only takes me 5 mins a week to balance the budget."

26533,best board games,"My initial reaction was why a forbidden game when you put in Pandemic? I like em and all but they are just way to light to last. Especially when you want to play a coop you just bust out pandemic! 

I like the sushi go add and probably the dominion add, but what are your thoughts on Concordia and clank!?????

57284,best water brand,"Youâ€™re saying a lot of idiotic and inaccurate things, and have a terrible attitude about it, calm down.

Mildly acidic water is not as bad as youâ€™re making it out to be. Our stomach acid is way lower in pH, and our blood has plenty of buffers to neutralize any potential change in pH caused by that water. 

By your logic we should stop eating pretty much all fruits. Apples are between 3-5pH so we should stop eating those, huh? Blueberries should probably eradicated from the earth for their deadly pH of 3, right? Smh"
