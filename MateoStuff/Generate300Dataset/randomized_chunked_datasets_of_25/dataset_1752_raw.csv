Daytona USA is a classic. Team Sonic Racing and Racing Transformed are both quality titles. I have been playing Dirt 5 which is a lot of fun. Horizon 4 has spoilt us though!
"How am I being condescending?

Dude can take whatever sort of trip he/she fancies but this doesn't change the fact that such a property provides a far from ""real"" travel experience.

I love Taco Bell but I'm fully aware it's not real food."
"His music is rather personal at times. I get he is labeled a cornball online but some of his music hits the same way Mac's music does for me. But thats just me. Joe is also extremely talented with his pen, mans had beef with some of the greatest and went back and forth with them. Got included in the super group Slaughterhouse for a reason. Theres a millions reasons to like his music. His personality does his music no favors though lol"

"...except for post-2000 vacuums sold in North America, which are no longer made by [Aerus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus), and therefore, just plain suck. 

Basically, if it doesnâ€™t look like your grandma's [cannister vacuum](http://www.vacuumland.org/TD/JPEG/MODERN/2014/dysonman1++3-12-2014-15-55-55.jpg), it's not the Electrolux you think it is."
"1 and 2:  are kind of incompatible, in my experience. The smaller the dog, the nippier it is, and they tend to be twitchy around kids. But then, I'm biased against small dogs.

3 and 4: should be easy to manage.

5: you wanted a dog. They bark."
"Sonicare is the best. My dentist noticed. Like I went for a cleaning and she said ""your gums look great"" etc. 


Also my teeth feel dentist clean all the time. So good."

"I agree with everything but ""lots of symbology"" - In TM, literally every symbol is explained on that card. Yes there is symbols and lots of them, but it is never confusing."
"Yup, I can understand if it was based on the Vikings, but after seeing him come in and boss out with a QB that they were shitting on, I'm a little surprised."
"Sadly I need a wireless set. If I had the budget for the GSP's I'd grab them. I'd love to actually hear a set of the 670's before buying. 

Going from these reviews I preferred the [mic quality of the MH670's](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cooler-master-mh670/7.html) comapred to the [Cloud Flight](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/hyperx-cloud-flight/6.html)"
100% preference.
"Free, you say? My mom and mom-inlaw are too far away to visit; after the obligatory phone calls maybe  I can also get my husband to shut up by finally going to the Stone Zoo with him."
