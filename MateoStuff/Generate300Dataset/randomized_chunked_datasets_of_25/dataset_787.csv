12112,best gifts for dad,"Yeah, I'm a single guy with a pretty good job, so pretty much anything I want I can afford; if I can't afford it, I'd not be comfortable with someone else buying it for me instead. But I love getting knick-knacks and desk ornaments and stuff like that, things people buy when they're on trips or at flea markets or what-have-you that I wouldn't be able to find on my own."
42248,movies like Inception,"When you go in knowing a movie is a mindfuck movie, you spend the whole time looking for the turn. With that said, you won't see the turn coming, I promise."
35215,best alcoholic drink,"Huh, I always say ""whiskey ginger"" but just looked it up and I guess ""Irish Buck"" is a common name for it. Actually having one now."
56428,best desktop monitor,"The G7 doesn't have ""deep blacks"". The contrast is one of the worst when it comes to VA monitors.

What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve. It's around 2.4 and the blacks are even higher unless you lower the black equalizer (to lower the rest, set it to gamma mode 2). A properly calibrated G7 doesn't look as ""fun"" or special as a G7 with default settings. And yes, I own a G7 and a colorimeter."
44307,best items under $100,"Get llama or alpaca. Won't kill your trees, but it will keep them neatly trimmed at llama head height. And the lawn. And they communally poo.

38601,best newspapers to read,"if no one reads TOI, how and why it is world's #1 newspaper! Personally, I have stopped reading newspaper. Google.com/news and FirstPost.com keeps me updated. Business Standard and Mint for business stuff. Sometimes, Telegraph, if I am travelling and stuff."

Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson

Night Fall by Isaac Asimov

Out of the Silent Planet by C.S. Lewis"
6195,best Netflix documentary,"I second Flint Town to the highest degree. I‚Äôm a born and raised Michigander so it hits very close to home. 

Last Chance U and Cheer are both excellent. Greg Whiteley is honestly a creative genius."
16105,best sunglasses for fashion,The hardest thing to build is a brand. Every single time you buy something name brand the majority of the cost is royalties for the brand. Using the world royalties in an unorthodox business fashion here.
48497,best color to paint with,"Beige, off-white, light gray are all good choices. Your walls should be neutral and light. Colors and personality should come in your furniture and accessories. Most of your furniture should be neutral too, but darker colors are ok. A little color goes a long way."
35406,best alcoholic drink,"I‚Äôve also kept some of this brown sugar/cinnamon in a small bottle and use it in cocktails, especially rum based ones. If you‚Äôre feeling really lazy, use the leftover apple cider that didn‚Äôt fit in the jugs and do rum and cider with a little bit of that mixture. It‚Äôs really good and quick to whip up if you don‚Äôt want to drink the cider plain."
72011,best movies with a cool twist,"I knew you'd say that.

 - Dungeon of the Endless (ipad)
 - FF: Tactics
 - Minecraft

 - Super Hexagon

Note: Super Hexagon...took me like 2 years to beat (granted, that included a few sizable breaks), but dang was that satisfying. Anyone who plays it knows there‚Äôs no handholding in that game."
63467,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Yes, but it‚Äôs free üòÅ

I used SwipeExtenderX, what actually is a good tweak, but it didn‚Äòt get along with slide typing. FlicksForAll works quite well with slide typing, though not perfect."
45005,best items under $100,Period panties are the best! I used to love a DivaCup but after having an IUD (since removed) I can't use it without pain (for reasons I don't understand). But period panties are the absolute best.

As the world expanded Asia was called ""The Far East""...
