45209,best items under $100,"An Amazon Echo Dot. I didn't own a speaker, so that alone made it worth it"
47198,best state to visit in the United States,Mmmmm...Baxter....
36742,best alcoholic drink,Amaretto and coke.
36417,best alcoholic drink,Have you ever tried just the mixer?
10310,best suitcase lock,"Put a small gun in it.  You will have to check it, and it will be visibly marked as a package carrying a gun. I GUARANTEE that bag will not go missing. Guns do not go missing in the airport. They are handled differently and have different security measures. 

My friends fly with super expensive camera gear a lot, and when they do, they put a small shitty gun in the bag.  The check process is a bit longer (5-10 minutes)  but i promise you, that bag/case will make it to your destination safely and soundly."
37764,best Marvel movie,I agree with 1-10 tho
57994,best cologne,"That's because they mix with oils in your skin and some other things, so even if the brand is good, it might not be the best for you, that's why you must keep trying new things until you find the one you feel is the best for you, or at least decent"
64562,Best Nike running shoes,"I guess I've never really been that big into running and if something felt comfortable I'd end up just using it :o I play hockey and volleyball so most of my exercise just comes from playing and I'll throw in short runs at lunch time or something if I feel like my cardio is failing (it's been nice to get away while WFH during covid also).

I think the only place around me is Roadrunner but I usually buy my shoes on clearance (i.e. I'll buy last year's model when they're like 30% off or something when new versions come out) or in this case I'm just going to buy them online from Nike. I always felt kind of weird having someone watch me run then feeling obligated to buy a shoe when I don't really want to buy one from there..."
14523,best romantic novel,"One of my favourite books too! So fresh, so sweet and so amazing I read it in one sitting!"
43793,best items under $100,"No clue.  True story: we've never once used it for a frozen pizza.  But if it's like everything else we use it for, you just throw that bad boy on there for a while until its sizzing and then you look at it.  You can eyeball pretty much everything with it."
58669,best cologne,"I've been blown out by the smell. I have an older version, not sure about the newest. It lasts around 8 hours, projecting maybe 3 to 4 hours then it's subtle. So yeah, projection is not great."
37674,best Marvel movie,"no i know, but where's the actual list you're talking about"
43394,best ad service for mobile applications,"May I ask, which country is not supported by Google IAP?

5268,best home improvement store,i think it just hasnt been approved yet because it has a shit ton of links... the mods have a spam filter on that i probably activated with that post. :)
13899,best research paper archive,"Wow, I just used libgen minutes ago to get the full pdf of the new study that shows humans have 27 emotions. Worked like a charm."
8894,best toothpaste,">Baking soda is an abrasive.

5949,best programming language for web development,"I just want to add that PHP is a powerhouse language to know, especially if you are interested in building full-stack applications and need to know some sort of backend language.

Laravel/Lumen are **amazing** and take most of the good bits from Ruby on Rails. 

The latest version of Laravel comes with Vue.js builtin and makes developing frontend thin-clients with PHP backends super easy. The way that you can template out resources (JSON) for APIs is fan-fucking-tastic.

PHP gets its share of historical hate, but really v7 is just great."
66446,best soccer team in the world,"I'm a dumbass, I confused the match against Uruguay with the one against Colombia."
41073,best instrument to play,"I am also a bass player and I agree, but plenty of people ignorantly chalk up bass as just the ""easy guitar"" and give no credit to what it takes to actually *be* a bass player, not just *play the bass*."
31247,best country to live in,"If you have a decent net worth or good paying job, then America.

If you don't, then Canada."
33316,best electric car,In my case a 28kwh Ioniq had better value even if it was a little bit more expensive.
69006,best science fiction novel,"A Scanner Darkly by Philip K. Dyck

24388,best anime,"Thanks for going back and looking at it, I knew it was get fucked over xD

  


I would just count any mention of clannad as a vote for the whole thing. Whether you list that as clannad franchise or just clannad after story is up to you. Idk if you've seen clannad but there is no chance anyone would ever mention it on a list and not be meaning the whole thing. It's just often referred to as just clannad."
