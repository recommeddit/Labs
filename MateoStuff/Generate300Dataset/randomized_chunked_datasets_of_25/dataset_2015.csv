9545,best toothpaste,"I am outing myself as a Registered Dental Hygienist here: use whatever you want, unless you are having problems.  If you have a lot of canker sores, avoid products with SLS.  I don’t recommend whitening toothpastes because the abrasive particles are a bit harsh.  If you want to whiten, try Crest Whitestrips, or go for the professional bleach from your dental office. Definitely always use soft bristled toothbrushes!  I buy Colgate Total for my family.  Please use fluoride!  All these non-fluoride products, and filters are causing a ton of decay.  
EDIT: Flossing daily is extremely important for keeping your teeth for your whole life.  You do not have to lose them due to “old age”."
69852,best major to study in college,"Piggy backing on this comment. Some of your course work will be insane, but stay on top of it. Also, keep your nose clean and go after jobs that require a security clearance (any level). You will probably not be a millionaire in this field, but you should be very comfortable.

38283,best newspapers to read,"I read editorial pages almost exclusively, and *by far* the most balanced daily national is the *Washington Post*.  They strive for centrism and they pay for very good syndicated columnists on both sides -- not just ""token"" conservatives or liberals like at the NYT or WSJ.

Now, as it happens, I hold centrism (this is a non-neutral, personal opinion) in contempt, so I don't have very much respect for the WaPo editorial board. But they serve an essential role in their determination to ""ride the middle"", siding against extremists on both sides every time.  As an extremist, I can find this frustrating, but the value to the Republic as a whole is obvious.

Read the WaPo."

53370,best usb c charging cable,"> gen2 uses extra wires for data? 

Seems to use the same number of wires, just differently.  

> The USB 3.1 Gen 2 standard increases the maximum data signaling rate to 10 Gbit/s (1.25 GB/s), double that of SuperSpeed USB, and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b.[58] The first USB 3.1 Gen 2 implementation demonstrated real-world transfer speeds of 7.2 Gbit/s.[59]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0#USB_3.1

Oddly, haven't found any mention of the physical differences between gen 1 and gen 2 cables.  

> I'd have thought more thickness would come from 5A rated cables

Perhaps a thicker shroud or shielding."

57757,best cologne,"I've tried several colognes but mainly use one: Calvin Klein One. First smelled it on my dad when I was a kid and it stuck with me. My ex-girlfriend even asked to keep a bottle as it was running out so she could remember the smell. I feel that its scent is part of my identity now, so I'm reluctant to change or try anything else."
