I would keep it light. Something that compliments the cabinets and counters. Gray would be nice. Even white would be nice and then doing a colored glass tile backsplash
Tom is the best foh with this
"Well it's explained in the third(?) film I think, where he takes some sort of intense muscle relaxers and stuff to slow his heart rate."
"Many people had the same opinion at the time. I've always loved Ralph Waldo Emerson's pronouncement about the war:

""The United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as the man who swallows the arsenic which will bring him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.""

And it did, because the integration of Mexican territory into US states is what kicked off the series of crises that ultimately ended in the Civil War."
The muffin man? Who lives on Drury Lane?
If your campaign is facing attacks based on what you did when you were a teenager that must mean you did a pretty good job of adjusting to being a professional adult. I wouldn't really worry about this if you are looking to be a politician in the far future.
croissant french toast. Just make normal french toast batter but dip buttery and delicious croissants in it and cook them up. So good
Rambo First Blood.
"Raw garlic, it also protects against vampires and people in general."

"Dave East
Jim Jones
Fabolous
Griselda
Styles P

Are in my opinion the most consistent rappers the last couple of years (and I am not even from New York but Europe)"
I think it is absolutely absurd to clump every genre's greatest albums into a list of **five hundred albums.** At this point it just seems crucial to separate this many albums by genre.
I agree though I’d prefer Montana on that monument over Brady.
"I have had that in the past but it is really hard to manage if they don't have auto cpm and there are very few with auto cpm for natives. 

&#x200B;

I do have InMobi and Smaato as well but didn't mention them as they make a tiny fraction of what those other ones make."
No mention of Jared Allen?  Seems like a real prankster and would be a total bro to hang out with.
"Nice shoe, I have a pair, but feel the React is a little over-rated. Nice pop from the air unit though. I only use them at the track these days so I don't have to change shoes and they handle the transition from effort to float well. Chalk and cheese when I put my VF4s on for TTs though."
Just bought my osprey.  Found the suggestion on BIFL.  I'm a bike commuter and the momentum suited me.  This is seriously the most thought out and well engineered bad I've ever owned.  Lifetime warranty doesn't either.
Great city to visit. Maybe not the greatest city to live in (although their are some cool things about living their).
Just plain `bash` (plus a multiplexer and a dropdown terminal). I've never used a curses-based manager.
"We are anomalous.

We are a region.

Forgive and forget.

Expecto patronum."
"Ok, what is your concern? And is your definition of ""personal freedom"" one that is generally accepted world wide?"
"Every time I drink Nestle, I always get sick. I know there’s no possible correlation, but it’s happened enough times that I have a special kind of hate for Nestle."
"Have all of the above except for SinCast that does sound interesting, thanks for the rec. Have you tried twenty thousand herz? One of my favorites now that's fairly unknown."
"For Mexican food, Mony's is the way to go. Awesome tacos + burritos with a huge salsa bar. Los Agaves and Los Arroyos are also awesome, but are definitely more expensive. Mony's is only open for lunch M-Sat  unfortunately..."
