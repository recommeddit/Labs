28483,"My coffee is made in a French press so I boil a little extra water for oatmeal.

Once a week I prep my own oatmeal mix: instant oats, powdered milk, raisins, cinnamon, powdered vanilla, a pinch of salt, and a little sugar. Seal into a quart mason jar and shake--3 minutes for 7 days.

The homemade instant oatmeal started out as something I do for medical reasons, but it turns out to be both cheaper and better than the store bought packets: food manufacturers use fillers such as guar gum--a thickener with no nutritional value--so you don't realize you're getting shorted on the oats.",best breakfast foods

6438,"The happy people: a year in the Taiga.  Absolutely terribly named doc about Russian fur traders in remote Siberia.  A strong feeling of self sufficiency and isolation here (think a little bit the mood of Deadliest Catch or other Man v Nature) but with an interesting subtheme about whether to stick to a more traditional mindset or not.  Hard not to think how cushy modern life is after, but also appreciate some of the peace and the pace of this totally different, almost pre modern life.",best Netflix documentary

EDIT: for those of you looking for a source, you can find a blog post mentioning her going away party [here](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cantaloupe-jelly-for-claire). The Alaska thing is just something I saw in the Twizzlers video, so it's absolutely possible that's not true. I'll update this if I find a source",best YouTube video

56315,"Yes - and that would make that next release closer to 'holy grail' for the year with HDMI 2.1, but to be fair, even without 2.1, this one is still a fantastic choice for all platforms. 

The new PS5 update enabled the 120hz for 1080p so you can still get those fast frames on this monitor.

Same with Xbox Series X/S - you can run those at 1440p/120hz on this. 

For consoles, the few games that do target 120hz will probably be bumping the resolution down anyway. 

If you're on PC, you're already getting the best this monitor has to offer through DP.",best desktop monitor

32109,"The Fontainebleau Miami. The restaurants are to die for (Scarpetta for an upscale option, Pizza & Burger for something casual...best pizza ever). The outdoor area has pools, cabanas, a walk up to a private beach with drink service, tons of beautiful plants, bars, etc. It is amazing! The hotelâ€™s best kept secret is a pool on the 7th floorâ€“its always chill, more relaxed and has pretty views. Itâ€™s open to guests but not mentioned on the website. I didnâ€™t get to the nightclub but there were huge lines for it and notable DJs playing. The entire resort has a very lux feel to it, there is so much attention to detail and beautiful architecture throughout the lobby and other common areas. You could easily stay there for a week and never leave the resort, there is everything you could need and more. It has the feel of a nice all inclusive resort. And not to mention, the staff was truly incredible! So many kind, professional, accommodating people whether it was the front desk, poolside, or at the restaurants.",best hotel to live in
