Back to Sweden with you"
50480,best rap album,Dat badu
28483,best breakfast foods,"My coffee is made in a French press so I boil a little extra water for oatmeal.

Once a week I prep my own oatmeal mix: instant oats, powdered milk, raisins, cinnamon, powdered vanilla, a pinch of salt, and a little sugar. Seal into a quart mason jar and shake--3 minutes for 7 days.

The homemade instant oatmeal started out as something I do for medical reasons, but it turns out to be both cheaper and better than the store bought packets: food manufacturers use fillers such as guar gum--a thickener with no nutritional value--so you don't realize you're getting shorted on the oats."
21024,best workout music,"Diddy, BIG and Busta - Victory

6438,best Netflix documentary,"The happy people: a year in the Taiga.  Absolutely terribly named doc about Russian fur traders in remote Siberia.  A strong feeling of self sufficiency and isolation here (think a little bit the mood of Deadliest Catch or other Man v Nature) but with an interesting subtheme about whether to stick to a more traditional mindset or not.  Hard not to think how cushy modern life is after, but also appreciate some of the peace and the pace of this totally different, almost pre modern life."
72313,best adblocker extension,lmao if you are using Adblock Plus you are about 5-6 years behind.
45096,best items under $100,"I'd love to buy some really cool pens and stuff, but I'm afraid I'll lose them too easily"
51334,best iphone case,"Did you go Tough Armor or Tough Armor with Mag? Tough Armor looks more protective, but I went with Mag because itâ€™s a feature I donâ€™t want to necessarily write off coming from an XS Max."
18574,best YouTube video,"Yeah, I love those too. Sadly, Claire (the woman who makes the gourmet candy) has left BA. she's started her own pastry bakery in Alaska, though, so that's cool.

EDIT: for those of you looking for a source, you can find a blog post mentioning her going away party [here](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cantaloupe-jelly-for-claire). The Alaska thing is just something I saw in the Twizzlers video, so it's absolutely possible that's not true. I'll update this if I find a source"
49117,best gaming monitor,"LTT reviewed the new Samsung G9, but itâ€™s got a fairly aggressive curve, but it was 1440p 240hz with Qled...canâ€™t get much better than that I think, but itâ€™s like $1700, but you did say money was no object lol.  Iâ€™d say go with that if you can live with the curvieness."
40450,best midrange GPU,"The best GPU in 2020 is the Nvidia 3090.

Now to answer your question, 2060 ko or rx 5700. Or wait for the 3060 though it has not been announced yet. https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-release-date-price-news-and-features"
15377,best tree for the garden,Coconut tree ðŸŒ´
56315,best desktop monitor,"Yes - and that would make that next release closer to 'holy grail' for the year with HDMI 2.1, but to be fair, even without 2.1, this one is still a fantastic choice for all platforms. 

The new PS5 update enabled the 120hz for 1080p so you can still get those fast frames on this monitor.

Same with Xbox Series X/S - you can run those at 1440p/120hz on this. 

For consoles, the few games that do target 120hz will probably be bumping the resolution down anyway. 

If you're on PC, you're already getting the best this monitor has to offer through DP."
54162,best medicine for a cold,Same here.  Meth heads ruined it for all of us.  I feel like a criminal just asking for the medication.
32109,best hotel to live in,"The Fontainebleau Miami. The restaurants are to die for (Scarpetta for an upscale option, Pizza & Burger for something casual...best pizza ever). The outdoor area has pools, cabanas, a walk up to a private beach with drink service, tons of beautiful plants, bars, etc. It is amazing! The hotelâ€™s best kept secret is a pool on the 7th floorâ€“its always chill, more relaxed and has pretty views. Itâ€™s open to guests but not mentioned on the website. I didnâ€™t get to the nightclub but there were huge lines for it and notable DJs playing. The entire resort has a very lux feel to it, there is so much attention to detail and beautiful architecture throughout the lobby and other common areas. You could easily stay there for a week and never leave the resort, there is everything you could need and more. It has the feel of a nice all inclusive resort. And not to mention, the staff was truly incredible! So many kind, professional, accommodating people whether it was the front desk, poolside, or at the restaurants."
57159,best water brand,"Yep, many Reverse Osmosis water filters have a stage after the filtering where they add minerals back in to make it taste better."
34898,best NFL player,"The spread for Deshaun seems relatively wide for someone in the top 20. Some rankers, including myself, have him around the top 5, others not even in the top 30. I canâ€™t help but think some rankers may have let the allegations and legal issues bias them, because from a football perspective, he had an incredible season, with the worst supporting cast out of any QB on the list."
72022,best movies with a cool twist,Planet of the Apes or Memento.
58759,best cologne,People WILL start identifying you by your smell it's really interesting. I left my backpack in a room and someone brought it to me knowing it was mine purely because it smelled like me. That was nuts. At that point I knew how important scent was.
29951,best money managing app,Similar idea. Just better I think.
