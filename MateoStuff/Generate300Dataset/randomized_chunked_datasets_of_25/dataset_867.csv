66706,best soccer team in the world,"Yeah, I don't know why people like to so strongly exaggerate the size of emigration from Yugoslavia. Of course it exists, but in terms of national football teams it doesn't play some game-changing role. It's not some main reason why these countries have so many talented athletes.

The guy said ""often"", and then he gave two examples. One is RakitiÄ‡, true. The second one is VejlkoviÄ‡, who played like a few games for Serbia in 2018 (and adds 4,5 million in this table). There is a lot of ex-Yugo people raised in German countries, but it's not something completely changing their football team."

11273,best gifts for dad,"biggest problem really is that most dads can buy the shit they want, especially anything that's in the price range of a child/college student.

Handmade is something that he can't buy, so always shows some real thought/effort made"
40732,best instrument to play,"Guitar, you don't have to be advanced at all to make something cool. Like just learn three or four chord positions in whatever key you want, and suddenly you can play many pop songs, or create your own. It's awesome. You don't even have to know which notes you're playing, if you don't want to.

In my opinion, guitar's the most fun for beginners, but any instrument is fun after you put work into it."

34439,best NFL player,"no, i'm pretty sure you're missing the point here - Montana's plays are iconic to you because you're a 49ers fan. it's also why you give them undue weight.

when Brady has retired i don't think any non-biased fans are going to look back on those two and point to any discrepancy in iconic plays."

I work retail and am paid every 2 weeks, I'm still fighting my credit card debt so I haven't gotten to age my money as of tet, but with YNAB I am in a MUCH better financial place than I have ever been. Best impulse Steam Sale purchase ever."

6. Platinum

5. USUM

4. X&Y

3. BW2

2. HGSS

1. ORAS

To add to this, I have a different list for which regions I loved the most. Though this is more aesthetic of the world based and less mechanically inclined.

&#x200B;

1. Jhoto (admittingly, this is mostly nostalgia goggles here)
2. Unova
3. Hoenn
4. Kalos
5. Alola
6. Sinnoh
7. Kanto

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know its controversial but to be honest I never liked shinnoh as much.

I decided this year to play every game in order of release (yes every main title ever) just to put things in perspective for myself and give DPPL a solid second chance. While I can appreciate it more now that people aren't hammering it as the best pokemon game anymore I don't feel the need to fight against its positives, freeing myself from some of the bias I had. Ill probably make a post in the future about this. Anyway even though I like sinnoh more than I had in the past I still like it less than X & Y. 

&#x200B;

X & Y were when the games got easier but I think some of the best improvements of the series were made during its implementation. They eliminated a lot of the grind that made an entry barrier for those who would often be too busy to make a competitive team. Destiny Knot became a godsend for breeders and I really hope super training returns because it made the most boring part of training Pokemon fun. Not to mention the jump to 3d. X&Y did A LOT right and I think its too often its not given the credit it deserves. This is more of an aesthetic thing but I think X and Y have some definite charm to it as well.

42230,movies like Inception,"There was actually a movie called [Thr3e](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486028/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_32) that was almost identical to the one they made fun of in Adaptation.

It came out in 06, Adaptation came out in 02, so it's completely possible that Thr3e actually stole their plot from a joke in Adaptation.  It's fucking awful, by the way.  It was the first release from Fox Faith, which was Fox's Christian division.  

God it was bad.  It was SO bad."

33684,best electric car,"I doubt that will be true, but we'll see. The reason it looks like they are holding so well is because they have been discounted a few times now. 

If you bought a Model 3 Performance with the so called performance package, you'd pay $69,000 in August 2018. Today, that same vehicle with the package included is only $59,900. 

I doubt they will get discounted much from here on out, but if I bought mine before one of the huge price drops I'd be pretty upset."
