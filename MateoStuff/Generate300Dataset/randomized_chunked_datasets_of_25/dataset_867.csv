The guy said ""often"", and then he gave two examples. One is RakitiÄ‡, true. The second one is VejlkoviÄ‡, who played like a few games for Serbia in 2018 (and adds 4,5 million in this table).

Like just learn three or four chord positions in whatever key you want, and suddenly you can play many pop songs, or create your own. It's awesome.

I know its controversial but to be honest I never liked shinnoh as much.

I decided this year to play every game in order of release (yes every main title ever) just to put things in perspective for myself and give DPPL a solid second chance. While I can appreciate it more now that people aren't hammering it as the best pokemon game anymore I don't feel the need to fight against its positives, freeing myself from some of the bias I had. Ill probably make a post in the future about this. Anyway even though I like sinnoh more than I had in the past I still like it less than X & Y. 

&#x200B;

X & Y were when the games got easier but I think some of the best improvements of the series were made during its implementation. They eliminated a lot of the grind that made an entry barrier for those who would often be too busy to make a competitive team. Destiny Knot became a godsend for breeders and I really hope super training returns because it made the most boring part of training Pokemon fun. Not to mention the jump to 3d. X&Y did A LOT right and I think its too often its not given the credit it deserves. This is more of an aesthetic thing but I think X and Y have some definite charm to it as well.

It came out in 06, Adaptation came out in 02, so it's completely possible that Thr3e actually stole their plot from a joke in Adaptation.  It's fucking awful, by the way.  It was the first release from Fox Faith, which was Fox's Christian division.

If you bought a Model 3 Performance with the so called performance package, you'd pay $69,000 in August 2018. Today, that same vehicle with the package included is only $59,900.
