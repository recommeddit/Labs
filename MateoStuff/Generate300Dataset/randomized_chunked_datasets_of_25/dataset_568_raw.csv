"I live in Atlanta—the Home Depot Mecca— and I still find that the few Lowes around generally have a better selection. I *want* to use HD exclusively because theyre so convenient for me, but they just dont have the selection."

Any browser being actively developed will tick all these boxes. Also don't ask for information on browsers here. A lot of people are biased.
"Mint Mate is also an option, but I can't tell if it's modern or not. I used to put TWM on all my VNC desktops, so pretty much everything is both less clean and more modern to me. I don't really love desktops that try too hard to be clever, and they often eat CPU in a way that feels really unnecessary. Just put the stuff where I can get to it - no magic, no hidden interface so it looks like nothing is installed, etc. I haven't tried Cinnamon (wanted low overhead for VMs), is it similarly chill like Mate?"

I keep feeling like I'm one of the few in the world who actually *likes* Bit-o-Honeys...
I 100%  agree about Emily and Richard! They were by FAR my favorite part. And the reason I didn't include Sapranos or Deadwood is cause I haven't seem them :P  but I've heard good things and have always wanted to! Hopefully when HBO launches their streaming service I can get them (if it's not super pricey)
"I was coming in here to say Jimmy Fallon. They filmed Factory Girl in my home town. I saw him in a restaurant with Sienna Miller (who is very tiny). He couldn't have been a nicer person and in the middle of meeting him Heath Ledger called him.
 He answered the phone ""Heath, I wish I could quit you."""
"And our football team hasn’t lost a game since 1954. Whose side? R’side!

Edit: Apparently we did once have a football program, I misremembered the joke."
"Most of California's public colleges are top-notch.

Stay away from for-profits.

You should be good to go.  Apply for Berkeley, but don't count on it unless you have something to separate you from other applicants.  No, good grades and academics don't do it.  That said, if economics and CS are your interests, try to find a way to combine them.  Make a tool and put it online.  Do something you can demonstrate.  That is a good way to get a leg up with the EECs folks at Cal."
"They're native to central Oklahoma about 150 miles north of here, and they're supposed to be hardy all the way down to the gulf coast. Maybe they're healthier in colder climes, but they still produce a ridiculous amount of sprouts regardless."
No compliments yet...
I didn't know you weren't supposed to wash them. How do you get the excess food crap off them after cooking?
"Apparently Gosling's has a license on the name ""Dark n Stormy"" and will sue you if you use another rum in the drink.

"> I ended up regifting the card because just thinking about using it stressed me out.

ya know whats good for relieving stress? A massage."
Wait you're wearing a stability shoe. Why not go to a running store first and see if you actually require a stability shoe or a neutral shoe? This is a life changing step friend.
"Brown above Metcalf, the way it’s meant to be. Only person who can stop the Titans offense is Downing"
"Breakfast tacos, a tamale, a lime, salsa, black and kidney beans, black tea, shot of whiskey"
"this was a hilarious mental image for me, i'm sorry. just furiously pumping the immobile bike while this song is playing tickles me."
Divinity Original Sin 2 is a must play RPG
"It probably depends on the person. 
I can watch a movie even though I know it has a twist ending but still enjoy it, because I don't think about the fact it will end in an unexpected way."
Ignore this comment.  I meant to post this as a reply to another user.
