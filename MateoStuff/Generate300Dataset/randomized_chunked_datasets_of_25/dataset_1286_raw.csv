I'd say just a shower in silence would be nice. It seems like whenever I'm in the shower someone is having a meltdown.
"I'm going camping next week too. 

North of Lake Superior in Ontario, Canada. For just over a month.

Fingers crossed that new Kobo Libra H20 won't fail me."
Blindparts.com they have every part and detailed pictures of each item they carry.
So your bad teeth are a testament to flosspicks?
"`ranger` is the best!  Built to be easy to customize, with sensible defaults, and written in `python` (for further customization ease if you know python).  Beware that ranger can sometimes be a bit weird about error messages.

If you use `emacs -nw`, then `dired` is also a viable option."
I'm sorry for your loss.
"Volvic, by far. It has a slightly sweet taste to it which I like. Then again, it’s different for everyone."
"It seems the LG 34GP83 isn't available in EU, only the older 850-b (practically identical) which is $200 more expensive -.-"
"Thanks.  There's a store here in St Paul called Northern Brewer and they have start up kits that a bit more complex versus the amazon or groupon home brew kits.  
A box for $30 makes 48 bottles.  

Does that sound like more a reasonable buy? 

Edit: I meant the $30 ingredient box.  
The start up kit is $90 - $140.  

I think I'll go get it today while I have some time off"
Someone could give me this as their top 10 and I wouldn't really argue with it. Though Doctor Strange over Infinity War is hard to swallow. And I'd have BP around 4 or 5. One of the best movies in the MCU but not top 3.
"Planetes and Eureka Seven are right there

However omission of Tsuki ga Kirei is hurtful"
Listened to the first 2 tracks and shit this is fuckin hard. PDA is amazing. Imma check the rest of it out tomorrow. Checked out Paris Texas too and they were also good. Good year to be named Paris ig lmao
"My first exposure to SciFi was: 'Martian Chronicles' - by Ray Bradbury

Was hooked after that."
My kids are toddlers sooo this would most likely fall on my husband but I love to make cookies so maybe a cookie scoop? They're so efficient but I would never be able to justify spending $6+ to get myself one.
how are you liking the battery life on the 12 pro max?
"Mostly sugary stuff, although we like to kid ourselves that [Special K](https://www.google.com/search?q=special+k&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&authuser=0&ei=Qi8EUNuTH5C1hAeNmfHxBw&biw=1280&bih=644&sei=RS8EUPOWE8uJhQerl9T7Bw) is healthy."
"For angry/aggressive workouts, Rob Zombie's [Dragula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI) gets me pumped. That, and Rammstein (nearly half their albums are the right mix of rage and tempo)."
"Erik, is that you?"
and scripps are all girls high school grads
"Climbing up the topsails, I lost my leg!!!!"

"Same.  Exact.  Boat.  Studied accounting.  Went into investment banking, but don't see longevity from a happiness perspective.  Feel that engineering would have given me the happiness longevity."
I don't work out as hard at home as I do when I'm at the gym. I only work out at home if there's a bad storm out or the gym is closed.
My HTC One M9 I can't see in landscape at all and it's super annoying. I blame the phone not my glasses tho
"I’m with you. Uninstalled Sileo and Cydia after the last update,works perfectly."
