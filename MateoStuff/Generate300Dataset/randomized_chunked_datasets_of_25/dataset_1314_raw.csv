"- **Destiny's Road** by Larry Niven: I love the lower stakes, the more personal journey covering the main character's entire life against a sci-fi backdrop.

- **Consider Phlebas** by Iain M. Banks: Made me realize space operatic sci-fi could still be literary and the series influenced my outlook on life.

- **The Quantum Thief** by Hannu Rajaniemi: The first book to really challenge me in a really long time. Really interesting concepts and I love how imaginative he is.

- **Count Zero** by William Gibson: Better characters that Neuromancer and expands on that foundation.

- **Friday** by Robert Heinlein: I remember being so impressed by the book's descriptions of what is essentially Wikipedia in a story written in the early 80s."

"Don't feel guilty. As long as you are reading books you are enjoying, that's all that really matters. But thanks for the page."
"Yup, that’s my only annoyance now, it could be faster to access the package queue, but they said that will be fixed in a future update, so I’m patient."
"Whatever you choose to buy, I have a few recommendations. Firstly, don't buy new. Paying 1000+ for a device that's gonna last a few years isn't advisable imo. There's this website called BackMarket that I've used, where they sell you certified refurbished stuff at pretty good deals. I'm talking like, 200 dollars for a Samsung Galaxy S10, and pretty good quality too. I got my own phone (Oneplus 7 pro, 256gb) from the website a couple months ago for around 220 dollars, and honestly it feels like a brand new phone out of the box, aside from a few microscratches here and there on it. Not an advertisement or anything, just my personal advice for getting the best bang for your buck in terms of mobile devices. 

Also, charge your devices properly. Do you use 100-0% of your battery range? That's what desroys the battery quickly. I recommend keeping it 20-80% as the ideal sweet spot for the battery, it's the best range to keep any lithium ion batteries, and it more than doubles their lifespan from that alone. Also, keep it away from getting too hot. My old phone, I charged it that way for 5 years and by the time I replaced it, it felt like it still retained 90%+ of it's original battery capacity.

BIFL isn't all about buying a certain device, it's also how you maintain it. If you don't stress the battery, keep it in the ideal range, use a cover and a screen protector, you can easily extract 5+ years of service out of your mobile device. At that point, you'd be replacing it out of desire for something newer, rather than necessity. To replace out of desire rather than necessity, now that's what I like to call true BIFL quality."
"I'm poor so I can't afford the real stuff, but my go to daily perfume was a knock off of 'happy' by god knows who I can't remember >< but my all time favorite and most surprising to people is diors poison! My mom gave me a knocked off bottle she got (she stole her moms in the 80s, and I stole hers in the early '10s) and I recently found an almost exact replica, in an oil base compared to the normal bases. It's so deep and sexy!!"
Thanks for the links!

That right there alone should tell you that the script sucked. I'm all about shows that make you think long after you watch them... which every season and show did, except the final."

"> lying about it being a bad deal economically isn't the way to do it.

Where was I lying?  Even your inexpensive bottled water is massively more expensive than your tap water.  It's easy math.

>Fiji Water leaves a large negative environmental footprint, as well as negative economic consequences for the people of Fiji.

>In 1995, Fiji Water built a facility to extract the water from underground springs that was entirely run on diesel. In 2008, the Fijian government wanted to raise taxes on Fiji Water, which until that point had enjoyed tax-exempt status, and in response, Fiji Water laid off workers. In 2010, the Fijian government tried to raise taxes again, and Fiji shut down its plant for a short period of time. 

>Fiji Water works in Fiji to produce this beautifully packaged bottled water shipped all over the world. Meanwhile, 12 percent of Fiji residents do not have access to clean, safe drinking water, according to the Water Authority of Fiji (via Xinhuanet). While Fiji Water has access to underground springs, the Fijian people have to deal with rusty pipes and an only sometimes functional water system.

Or...

>Nestlé has never been a controversy-free corporate neighbor. Critics charge that Nestlé is unjustly exploiting a public resource, but Michigan law permits any private property owner to withdraw from the aquifer directly below for free, given they pay a nominal $200 paperwork fee each year. In the context of Detroit’s ongoing water shutoffs to poor residents and Flint’s continued billing for lead-poisoned water, Nestlé’s bargain deal has predictably sparked outrage across the state.

>But Nestlé isn’t alone. Industries, utilities, and farms all withdraw hundreds of billions of gallons each year from Michigan groundwater sources. Pfizer’s pharmaceutical manufacturing operation near Kalamazoo alone draws around 6.9 billion gallons annually. The difference? Pfizer returns over 97% of that water, unpolluted, to the ground. Nestlé ships most of its 1.7 billion bottles out of state and many of them outside the Great Lakes basin.

"That's hard to answer.  My close friends and I have had extensive discussions on the pros and cons.  It's definitely a double edged sword.  I'm lucky to have a job that pays for me to see other parts of the U.S. while allowing me not to have any bills and save money.  That is huge!  Also, I'm a minimalist so I do enjoy having a few things in a small place that is clean.  Most are the cons are obvious, no girlfriend, no hanging out with friends whenever you want.  There are many sacrifices.  Plus, something that gets overlooked is that when you are on the road for work you pretty much LIVE the job.  You work as the schedule demands and when you're ""off"" work, you're fielding calls and sending reports.  They don't send you out here to have a good time.  It would be hard to do this for more than 4-5 years.  I justify it by telling myself it's a means to save money quickly to jumpstart me into doing what I really want to do."
My town's tap water is better tasting than any brand of bottled water I've come accross
"When I started out I had a C270 aswell.
What disturbed me the most was the „Field of View“ because the camera had to be far away from you to get you on screen.
I have a C920 since some months now and I‘m happy. 

But for starting out its okay. :)"
