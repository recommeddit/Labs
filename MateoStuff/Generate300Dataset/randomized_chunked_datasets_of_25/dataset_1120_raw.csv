"Good engineering programs will have a gen-ed type intro to engineering class you should take in your first two semesters.  It should give you a chance to try out different types of engineering.  


I would recommend talking to professors that teach the higher level classes.  Let them know you are interested and see what they think about things that interest you.  i.e. job prospects, job security, grad school requirements for positions you want, pre-requisites for upper level classes, possible minors that wouldn't require a large extra load of classes, co-op positions, etc.  


Then if you still have the time, try to network with some actual practicing engineers in the fields you are interested in.  Go to some job fairs your first semester, even if you aren't graduating anytime soon and just go check out the prospective companies and talk to them.  Get a connection that could give you an in for a co-op in your second or third year.  Those damn things are worth their weight in gold when you get out.

Good luck!  It's a fun ride, but do your homework."
"Hi, great list. I'm overwhelmed by the choices. I'm looking for a reliable laptop that can last me for years, great battery and lightweight. My maximum budget is $1,300 but if it's not much better than say a $700 laptop, then that's a no brainer. Thank you for your help in advanced :)"

Has held up well.  Not gigantic either, will definitely work with your specs.  

There's other options too if you don't like the USB port thing (kinda detracts from the overall look IMO)."
"Jason brand is great! 

We had a little trouble finding a product to help with enamel erosion from orthodontic braces, but we finally settled on non-fluoride MI Paste (calcium phosphate) which should work just fine as an adjunct, because all the other fluorinated toothpastes had SLS."

Some people only class games where you make your own character an RPG. And I agree to some extent.

"Why are soft bristle's better than harder bristles? I've tried softer ones, but I've always felt that even though the bristles move around more, they can't get any grime off my teeth. Is the flexibility that important?"
"Ring holder by his computer keyboard. He lost about 4 wedding bands because he likes to take it off while typing (fingers swell, metal clicks against the keys), and mom was really getting frustrated that they just kept disappearing. Got him a simple little stone bowl that he leaves it in and problem solved. $15 solution to otherwise expensive problem."

"Hi, since screen size is very important, I'd go with the [**Lenovo IdeaPad S340 13""**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-ideapad-S340-13-3-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-10210U-Quad-Core-Processor-8GB-Memory-256GB-Solid-State-Drive%2F189037520). It isn't on my list since it is a bit niche. You get a 4-core i5-10210U processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS 300 nit display. It is fine for light video and photo editing, plus it is only 2.86lbs."

"USA today is too short to have a strong bias, although you can see their bias in what they exclude. Honestly, I suggest reading both the NYT and Economist, none are center but they complement each other decently. Al Jazeera is decent as well. 

Everything is biased, the key isn't avoiding it, just to be aware of it."
