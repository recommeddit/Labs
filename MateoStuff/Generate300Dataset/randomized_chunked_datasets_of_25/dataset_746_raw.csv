"u/GMkOz2MkLbs2MkPain gave me some great feedback on portable battery features and  options, including Anker and [RavPower](https://www.ravpower.com). I ended up getting a 20000mAh battery and a 30W GaN wall charger from RavPower. I know, 20000mAh is a lot.

"I feel really strongly about this. Not webcams specifically, but when people post things like ""Just starting out/thinking about streaming, what do I need?"" and people push them toward top end pcs and hundreds of dollars of tech like that's the minimum setup you need to stream. I don't know if people genuinely think someone just starting out needs a professional quality setup (obviously false,) or if they just enjoy pushing people to invest all their cash in a hobby they don't even know if they'll pursue longterm yet. But as a small streamer myself, it's not really my place to openly disagree when I see those posts."
"I work with a third party dev in work who keeps mentioning machine learning in planning meetings. Like, he just keeps saying it, but then talks about the reasons why he's not currently capable of implementing any 'machine learning' functionality to the application. There're some people who are just so full of it"
I wouldn't get any small pets for a younger child. It's too easy for a child to injure or kill them. A dog would be ideal but I agree that you can't leave them from 8-5. Maybe you could get her an adult cat from a foster rescue? Kittens are too small and high maintenance but an adult cat can avoid an overly physical kid and you can choose one based on personality. A good rescue should be able to identify a cat that is playful and likes kids and be willing to do a test run in case things don't work out. We have a 20 month old and a young cat (predates daughter). Our cat is just beginning to enjoy her company and we encourage our daughter to help take care of him (kitty treats) and play with him under our supervision.
