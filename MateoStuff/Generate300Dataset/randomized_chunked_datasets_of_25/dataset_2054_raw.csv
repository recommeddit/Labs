"The absolute best shower gift I got was from a couple of girlfriends of mine. They got me a gift certificate for a massage/soak at a local wellness center, and they both came over to the house, watched the baby, and gave my house a good cleaning. It was amazing. 17 years later, and that's the gift I remember the most. If she doesn't have anyone that she trusts with the baby, you can watch her/him while your wife goes out, and hire a housecleaner to come in for a couple of hours. If my husband did that for me, even today, as a full-time student and mom of teenagers and tweens, I would be over the moon!"
"Sleepaway camp really becomes a scary movie because the twist comes out of nowhere. It's a typical slasher movie with no scares until that ending. The last shot freaked me out so much I had to tell myself that it wasn't real. If you're going to watch it, watch it in the day."
I like edm like deep house so avicii is my fav. If you go to soundcloud and look up his 2015 concert at UMF is pretty good sampling of some good gym songs
"Someone recently expressed to me that Eastern European cities tend to be very clean, and it may be a cultural thing. I was surprised to hear it too, but maybe that's the reason?

Anyway, in the U.S. we have plenty of pee, trash, and homeless, so I'm curious to see how DK compares in that regard.

Before I went to Prague a couple of years ago I read a blog from a European visitor who called it dirty. Then I got there and it was vastly cleaner than anything we have in the U.S. So I did somewhat develop the idea that this concept is relative."
"If you ask almost any player listed here, they would say Tom Brady is the greatest of all time.  Right now, there's a bunch of fans who are going to have a hard time accepting it, and that's fine.  After he retires, I think almost everyone will admit it."

"Bruiser Brigade have been killing it this year! My brother's been tooting their horn for years and finally got me onto them this year. Will definitely try out the ones I haven't heard listed here, thanks!"
"Not mathematical, but Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119002257/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_WhB.AbRPZ14ET

Is a good start to communicating results and really easy to understand. Almost mind blowing how much I was missing previously."

"> Germany has quite the interesting and sordid past.

Understatement of the year, right there."
I second this! No other show has made me laugh more than Peep Show.
I’m usually into hip hop but I’m not opposed to it! Anyone specific? Excision would probably be good.
"And if the bottled water isn’t soft, it usually has waaaay too much bicarbonate."
"4ms and is real smooth and has nearly no noticable delay next to vg248qe 1ms tn display. I can't even feel a diffrence, but them colors and blacks."
Not me checking to make sure my dreamie isn't on this list because then I won't get in.
"I mean it's been up for a month.

You can't return it?"
"The Logitech G305 might work. It's great in fingertip and wireless. If you swap the AA battery for a AAA lithium with a converter you can get it to around 84 grams and still get around 2 months of play form one battery.   


I searched for G Pro Wireless prices in Aus and the lowest historical price I saw was around  $165 so that may be an option too. If you take out the bottom plate on that you can get it to 77g. 

Unless the Razer Viper Ultimate goes down in price, those are pretty much the only solid wireless options at the moment."
You can also refer to the period as Graeme Smith's captaincy.
"To which I'd respond by telling them to look at the past two decades of La Liga.



Annual Winnings: 

FC Barcelona: **8**  ('12-13, '10-11, '09-10, '08-09, '05-06, '04-05, '98-99, and '97-98)

Real Madrid: **7** ('11–12, '07–08, '06–07, '02–03, '00–01, '96–97, and 94'-95)

Atletico: **2** ('13–14, and '95–96) 

This pretty much knocks out Atletico. 



Obviously, Madrid and Barcelona are pretty much even, but for a newcomer to football, I'd say Barcelona has been more relevant in recent years."
"same, but its 70$ CAD. Had a hard time taping the Visa loll. But worth it imo."
The folks at Planet Fitness may have something to say about pillaging...
This game is great and the graphics still hold up.
"Travel to PA and go up to potter/Clinton county. Hop on any of those trails like the Black Forest trail, STS, quehanna trail. Beautiful state with beautiful trails if you are willing to drive."
