33830,"kanto and johto you should play the remakes instead. for hoenn they are different enough so you might want to play both. personally i go by release order:

firered/leafgreen -> emerald -> platinum -> heartgold/soulsilver -> black/white -> black2/white2 -> xy -> omega ruby/alpha sapphire -> (sun/moon optional) -> ultra sun/ultra moon -> sword/shield

ultra sun ultra moon are enhanced versions to sun moon similar to emerald and platinum. their story are 75% similar, but most agree sun moon has the better story but ultra sun ultra moon are better in every other way. if you really want to play sun moon for the ""different"" story, at least pick the opposite version so you can get the exclusive pokemon (sun then ultra moon or moon then ultra sun). if not just stick to ultra sun ultra moon.",best Pokemon game
