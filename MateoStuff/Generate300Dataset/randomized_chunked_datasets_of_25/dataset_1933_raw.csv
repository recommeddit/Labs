I'm actually one of those weirdos that doesn't mind the taste. xD
"Isn't Hypochlorite a component of bleach, and pool disinfectant?"
Her character definitely grates as much as she grows on you. I found it helpful to see it as the genius of the actor. Any episode where Moira winds up at the Herb Ertlinger winery is pure gold to me.
"Goat cheese honey and fig I can figure out what it taste like, and must be amazing. Crème caramel should taste very great too. Thanks for your answer!"
"Big Luda fan, Word of Mouf is that shit."
"Agreed with all of these for sure, but IMO New in Town >>> Come Back Kid when it comes to John’s work."
"I always loved computers, taught myself programming when I was 14, etc. Due to some not great advice and the recent (back then) dot-com crash, I ended up choosing mechanical engineering as a ""safer path"".

I still enjoy it. But with CS, I could enjoy it *and* make twice the salary."

"Maybe slightly atypical, but lots of people play their games more than once. Especially those that are in the reddit guild and contribute their rankings to this list."
"Anything by Georgette Heyer - they are so rereadable and satisfying, every detail is pitch perfect"
"The last line of Rendezvous with Rama gave me chills.

[spoiler](/s ""Not sure the way the series ended was that good though"")"
Scanner Darkly would be worth a shot.
Pimms and moscato.
"I don't understand why you're telling me this. The use of the console is for playing video games, as far as I know. Not garnering emotional support from strangers, or trying to gin up negative responses then be all butthurt. I'm poor, too. Congratulations."
"lol the mods I guess don't understand audiobooks...they hid this post.  Every time I post this site here for people to download the mods are like DERRRRRRRRRRRRP IT'S A PAY SITEEEEEE DERPPPPPPP YOU MIGHT BE ADVERTISING DERPPPPPPPPPPP.

Fucken a people are dumb.  It's essentially like audible being free and they have a lot of stuff that audiobookbay won't have."
"All I can tell you is that when I poured red Kool-aid into my Britta, it came back as pretty much clear water.  It did have a slightly pinkish tint."
"I'd be that shitty kid who emptied the bowls that some families left by their front door.

Those were pretty big hauls, usually."
"OBDII code reader if you have a car. $20-$50, used with a smartphone app over bluetooth.

Can instantly save you ~$100 for a mechanic to tell you what's wrong. Can save you from buying a money pit when shopping for a used car. 

Google the code + car model and the internet can usually tell you what to do. A lot of the time it can be ignored."
"Sprowston Manor in Norwich, England. My husband and I were living abroad for two years and he surprised me with a mini-getaway there for my 23rd birthday. 

The food, the spa, the room.... it was such an amazing experience."
"Stay in your house, nowhere is safe"
"Candy corn is great, until you eat the 6th one. It's just a sweet headache after that."
"obviously mileage will vary BUT these are the ones that I, personally, would think of as categorically good flicks on their own:

Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, 
Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther

i also love Age of Ultron but it is kind of a mess. Every other Marvel movie i have basically zero interest in rewatching most of the time. Infinity War and Endgame are ok but you have to have seen at least 80% of the MCU already to fully buy into it. (also Winter Soldier is extremely well-loved but it’s just not my thing i guess)"
Those (g)mail add-ons can be replaced by the rule: open your mail once or twice a day at set times.
"Griddle pan waffles with bacon, fried egg and maple syrup. Mmm..."
"It does, thank you!"
