47552,best state to visit in the United States,"To add to this, make sure you get up north. Shasta, lassen, Humboldt, the trinity alps. Northern California has mind boggling natural beauty without the crowds. There's a whole half of the state north of SF that people forget about.

ETA: Yosemite is otherworldly and absolutely worth going to, just try to hit it during the week and ideally not during summer vacation."

53356,best usb c charging cable,"I’m currently dealing with a loose iPhone 7 charging port that can still hold a charge, but there’s no “click” when inserting an Apple lightning cable, or a third party lightning.  When using a dongle while running, the dongle slips out & constantly pauses the music in my earbuds.  I found out at the apple store yesterday that some third party lightning cables can do some damage to your pins; I may have been guilty of this over the years with my phone.  They also said that they can’t replace the port.  I currently am doing the electrical tape method inside the port (YouTube).  

Any recommendations of legitimate cables for my next iPhone, besides apple’s cables?  Please & thank you!"

64428,Best Nike running shoes,"I wonder why shoe companies don't do something obvious like put a ""-C"" or a ""-S"" after their shoe names?  For instance, Vazee-C.  Now you immediately know it's a cushion shoe.  

Maybe that's too obvious or something.  I don't work in marketing."

46996,best hand santizer brand,"Cleaning your bathroom fixtures with diluted bleach solution is plenty, but you aren't killing everything, even if you use bleach and hydrogen peroxide. Diluted bleach will kill e coli, staph, salmonella, norovirus, basically all the potty viruses and bacteria you would expect to encounter if you licked a dirty toilet (probably don't lick a dirty toilet). Well, all the ones you can reach, anyway. 


But you don't need to worry about killing *everything* because you and your family are safely ensconced in a body. Keep the bathroom mostly clean, wash your hands with soap and hot water, and you'll be fine. If you're feeling neurotic, close the toilet lid before you flush. Seriously, why don't people do that? Thats why there is a lid.  


Not having children will probably go a long way in keeping your face uncontaminated, too. Kids are pretty gross."
