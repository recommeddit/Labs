best source of info i think is this forum:

52338,best hiphop album,No Jay-Z ? Whack list. Also this list seems like it was compiled by someone new to this sub.
42176,movies like Inception,Requiem for a dream is the best movie I'll never watch again.

65131,best phone service company,"I agree that it definitely depends on area.

I'm on Verizon and the service coverage in my area is nearly spotless* and I get 5G all over town.

^(Well, inside one particular Publix I can have trouble getting service.)"
18086,best Kardashian,">""he also said that when kim thought no one was looking, she went through jojo siwa’s kitchen counters lmao ((jojo’s mom saw this through their house cameras)""

But... Why?"
18291,best YouTube video,Leeroy Jenkins is older than YouTube.
70493,best major to study in college,"Theatre major (BA, not BFA/conservatory)

Best: 
- I love my classes
- it’s a small major so I get a lot more opportunity for one-on-one teaching
- I get to spend time with my friends
- I feel challenged both academically and creatively
- performing arts is one of the top 5 fastest growing job markets of 2018 according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Worst: 
- people assume it’s a super easy major and look down on me for it
- seniors take underclassmen major’s spots in classes just because they want an “easy” class to fill out their schedule
- all the professors don’t get along
- things get very dramatic during audition season
- we have no funding so all of our classes take place in the lobby of the theatre"

51242,best rap album,If you feel comfortable ranking ye's albums then you might not get it
31401,best country to live in,I've only ever lived in Australia. It's ok.
72288,best adblocker extension,"Because it wipes everything out. I'm lazy af, I like password and site history left intact. But, again, clearing that data does nothing since it's local only. The tracking is done remotely, and they aren't going to allow you to clear that data. Just do private browsing, it does the same thing and you can switch back and forth without messing with settings. Only real point in doing this is if you want to keep your significant other (or in some cases, mom) from seeing what you've been doing online."
51462,best iphone case,"Yeah, I see your model. It seems great but some test said the protection for dropping is too light."
38367,best newspapers to read,"The Atlantic is amazing and the magazine that reminded me how much I value good journalism and reporting. You've probably read it, but just in case (and for anyone else), it was coming across this article that did it for me.

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/.

I'll have to check out high country news. I know very little about the western US, and live in Ohio so its one of those things that either could be eye opening or unrelated to me. Regardless, its worth checking out."
5795,best programming language for web development,"> PHP is used by 82.0% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know.

Right, because only PHP broadcasts its use in the headers.  That's meaningless.  Besides that, a lot of Web sites are standard WordPress with no developer involvement which is not ""the market"" in the sense that it matters to us."
61599,Best RPG game on PS4,Yeah the term is definitely being stretched by some people. It's like trying to call pop music rock because there's a guitar somewhere in it.
22441,best celebrity,I didn’t expect to like that show as much as I did and am eagerly anticipating season 2. Horny for love...

42327,movies like Inception,"I agree with Cloud Atlas.  After a certain point, my brother and I paused the movie every ten minutes or so to discuss what was going on.  Trying to keep track of how everything was connected felt like solving a puzzle.  It was a blast."
73046,best Linux distro,What I mean is that software and hardware can go through extensive testing and receive a tick of approval guaranteeing it will work.

41568,best instrument to play,"Definitely. It's larger size requires a farther left hand stretch + more energy needed to keep the instrument upright. Also, the physical properties of the viola make tone production a big challenge."
