Also in an interview I believe Robinson cited ""Book of the Long Sun"" as one of his favorite Sci-fi books, not sure if that's part of the same series or what with Gene Wolfe, but I may have to give that a read too. Thanks for this post!",best science fiction novel

I thought it would be redundant to list Clannad twice, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for season 1, so it would be listed as ""Clannad"" in the top 100, because that's what the bloggers did.

I did the opposite for Aria, because more people specified ""Aria the Origination"" than ""Aria the Animation"", so I counted ""Aria"" as a vote for ""Aria the Origination"".",best anime
