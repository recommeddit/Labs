55038,best places to hike in the east coast,"North Carolina has so much great free stuff. 

I would check out the Linville Gorge. You can camp there and there are tons and tons of very challenging and rewarding hikes with astonishing views. [Table Rock](http://www.summitpost.org/table-rock/185534). [Hawksbill](http://www.summitpost.org/hawksbill-mountain/200592).  You can also hike down into the gorge and swim. And there's [Linville Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linville_Falls#/media/File:Great_Stone_Gorge.tif).

Panthertown Valley is pretty great. And, of course, there's Smokey Mountains National Park."

22546,best celebrity,"Met Michael Jordan while off work when I worked at Disney and just casually said ""Hey Michael."" Got a ""Go Away"" as a response which pretty much turned me off of MJ forever. Some celebrities that were absolute delights though are Robin Williams, Johnny Knoxville (who I ran into at a military surplus store in NYC where he bought the sailor outfit you see him wearing in the Jackass movies, even signed my bag ""see you in the showers"") and Michael Clarke Duncan who rode The Haunted Mansion with me after I greeted him with his full name, such a nice dude with a hilarious laugh."
30119,best Mexican war to study,"The French and Indian war is seen by many as the single event in history that led to the founding of the United States of America. It put a huge financial burden on England, who then attempted to make up that deficit by taxing the living hell out of the colonies. When they got sick of paying for england‚Äôs debt and announced their independence, England tried to send the military in to control them. That... didn‚Äôt end well for them."

11755,best gifts for dad,"You're right, teaching him how to use a computer would be much easier to do in person. You should definitely fly to him first, and *then* teach him.

68451,best science fiction novel,"I first read ""antarctica"" by Kim Stanley Robinson, after that I basically got sucked into months of reading the whole mars trilogy, then 2312 (doh, forgot the year), then Aurora. I haven't actually tried his historical fiction books, but I've heard great things.

Also in an interview I believe Robinson cited ""Book of the Long Sun"" as one of his favorite Sci-fi books, not sure if that's part of the same series or what with Gene Wolfe, but I may have to give that a read too. Thanks for this post!"

8946,best toothpaste,"the benefit from water fluoridation is mostly for children.  but the benefit stays with you your whole life. so adults who grew up in fluoridated communities still have the protection.

the same can be said for the harmful effects as well.  overfluoridation is also a much bigger concern for children than for adults.  the level of fluoridation is picked very carefully so as to minimize these effects while maximizing benefit."

24282,best anime,"Most of the bloggers (as well as 2 of the polls) listed ""Clannad"" to represent the entire franchise, and they didn't specify which season they like more.  I thought it would be redundant to list Clannad twice, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for season 1, so it would be listed as ""Clannad"" in the top 100, because that's what the bloggers did.

I did the opposite for Aria, because more people specified ""Aria the Origination"" than ""Aria the Animation"", so I counted ""Aria"" as a vote for ""Aria the Origination""."
