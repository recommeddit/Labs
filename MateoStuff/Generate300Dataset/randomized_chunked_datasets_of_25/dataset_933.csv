17515,"Money really only helps with horizontal progression, i.e. limited time characters and such. It's generally agreed that the rare 5-star characters are stronger, but it's akin to the difference between heroes in Overwatch's early poor-balance days, not to your typical gacha where rare characters are twice as good. 

If you doubt me, look up a few tier lists. You'll find that they are all over the place and almost never agree where someone belongs. Despite owning more than half the roster, I actually use the main starting character in my core team because he's fun to play and totally viable if you build it right.

There's even a community of people dedicated to soloing the game with Amber, the ""worst"" character (who is still fine).",best iOS game

5193,"Two things:

1 - Lowes, at least in my area, tends to be more consumer oriented. It's for people doing home repairs or wanting to semi-DIY things. They have tons of fixtures, pre-cut lumber in several different varieties, lots of cabinet hardware and door hardware, etc.. HomeDepot is geared towards professional contractors. The stores here tend to have less variety of things like pre-cut boards and lumber, trim, and hardware and more large volume items, cases of fasteners, etc. 

2 - My customer service experiences with Lowes have been horrific. I ordered some very expensive kitchen appliances from them two years ago and they screwed it up SO badly that it took me 2 months to get my appliances and 5 months to have a working stove - and that's only because I gave up on them and hired a private plumber to come in and fix the issues that they caused and wouldn't take responsibility for.  I still buy little stuff at Lowes because they have it in stock as compared to HD, but I will never ever ever ever again use them for a large purchase or an installation. It's their loss, really, cause I bought my house 2 years ago and I have a long list of expensive projects that they're going to miss out on. Oh well.",best home improvement store
