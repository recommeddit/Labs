Steve Jobs biography. Not joking.
"Honestly, even the French/Indian war gets glossed over as a step that lead to the revolution.   It‚Äôs mainly the reason my our constitution lays out things like we can‚Äôt be forced to give up our homes so soldiers can stay in them.  (Grossly oversimplified explanation I know).  Plus the whole taxation without representation thing."
Here to second Azzaro. Almost every time I wear it and go to the store I get asked what I‚Äôm wearing and most women respond with ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm getting that for my husband!‚Äù
"The biggest mindfuck I enjoyed this year was from the Swedish film Border. It might be a bit different from what you‚Äôre asking, but you‚Äôll definitely have some good ‚Äúholy shit what the fuck is happening right now‚Äù moments."

"BIG one up for nectar... great options, very VERY durable, and great staff support. I‚Äôve bought 5 pairs, only need replacements because I‚Äôve lost (2 of) them. Also most, if not all, are polarized which is very important for retinal health"

No.
"If you are cool with teen dramas, I actually love CW's Nancy Drew. It's got a paranormal aspect to it.

Psych was awesome too. And iZombie too."
"Than what?

You must keep in mind there are less middlemen in the process looking to make money, and there is availability of goods and competition- which drives prices down.

Compared to the domestic US market- where just about every accessory you can think of has wild profit margins."
*Footfall* started me on Niven/Pournelle. I prefer it to the Mote universe.
That's how my mama taught me to eat Corned Beef Hash. Damn skippy
Tom Holland. He fits the part so well and I really enjoy seeing him as Spider-man.
"I loved White Fang so much, honestly. It just felt like such a grand adventure, more so than any book I've ever read. I liked it so much because it didn't drag as much as a lot of adventure novels, it just enough to the imagination and never felt padded."
Great advice. For my two cents' worth: my wife loves my Bulgari Blu
Read this as ‚ÄúDark Pit‚Äù aaaand I‚Äôve been playing too much Smash Bros
"Skycity in Auckland New Zealand. I went to New Zealand two years back with my ex. We traveled both islands in a month. On the last three days we had plenty of money left, and hotels in New Zealand are really cheap so we stayed at SkyCity for two nights. Could never afford such nice hotel in Sweden."

"You are right! Just looked at some of his posts. ""No brand wars"" indeed."
"The video editing for It's Alive is incredibly entertaining, too."
