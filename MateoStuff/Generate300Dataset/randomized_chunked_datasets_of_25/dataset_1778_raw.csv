"Some of the characters are really cool! Ah, but the protagonist, I don't like how things played out. Just my opinion"
Hahaha Alaska and Hawaii so jealous.
I’m on 14.3 it’s working
I'm 16 and read the newspaper every morning. It smells good.

"Maybe ""old"" (2009) news now, but I found George Church's [MAGE paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7257/full/nature08187.html) a fascinating read when it came out."

Hey man thanks for the link. I’m new to PC components and looking to get a PC soon. Would either the 24’ or 27’ work with a 580 4gb + i5 8400? I wouldn’t mind turning settings down but I’m thinking it might not be enough. I’d want at least 40 frames on most games
"OpenSUSE Tumbleweed as the Linux distro with KDE Plasma as the desktop environment. Give it a shot!

Also consider giving Manjaro a shot. Both are nice, but I prefer openSUSE TW because if things get messed up, the way the file system works allows you to roll back to a previous snapshot. The snapshots are auto taken whenever you update."
"Best: iPhone 5/5S. The form, feel, and having a home button. Favorite iPhone to this day and I miss Touch ID.

Not sure about the worst.

Edit: the 5 didn’t have Touch ID."

"The depressed idiots who think they’re clever workaround this by using a clear case. It always ends up looking like a man child babying his expensive toy he saved up 4 years to buy, with a cheap gummy covering"
"For me the top 5 most complimented fragrances in order from my collection so far are: 

1. Armani Privé Bleu Turquoise 

2. Byredo Mojave Ghost

3. Le Labo Another 13 and I only had this for a month

4. Bvlgari Tygar

5. MFK Aqua Celestia 

Every time I wear any of them, there’s always at least one compliment."
but their starting XI can't win the title in their own?
"Artist: Fraunhofer Diffraction

(to the side) I start work at a paper tomorrow. Wut
Can’t go wrong with grey and white
Total football Ajax!
"You are using ""coagulant"", do you not ""flocculant""?"
"I would strongly recommend you read the 5th book, Urth of the New Sun. I think it's technically considered a sequel, but it's really more of an epilogue that revisits the events of the previous books and shines light on what really happened in key moments. It completely changed the way I saw the first four books and in my opinion, the story is not complete without it."
Tradeoffs tradeoffs; amazing display or better writing. Why can’t we have it all? :(
"Neil Gaiman once told me that he was proud of me and asked for a hug. Of course I said yes, and it's one of my fondest memories to this day. He smells like a wizard.

Edit: spelling"
"Truth be told, give me the pepsi challenge with holy pandas and properly lubed holy razers and I wouldn't be able to tell one from the other"
"I'll give you a hint:

It's Vitamin C. For all stages."
I think this is a cryptic code telling them she wants them to move out
