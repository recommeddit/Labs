31721,best hotel to live in,"I had the Sony when it first came out because it allowed PDFs.  I thought 'hey, I can save on clutter and on money by just downloading books.'  I don't really like them.  They are good for a vacation.  Since I like to read multiple books at one time it's great not to have my backpack overloaded when I'm on a trip.  But to me there is something about them that falls short over the long term.  I love having the book in my hand.  Also most of the stuff I read is non-fiction so I'm constantly dog-earing and re-referencing material.  It still is a battle though, especially if I get free wikipedia with the Kindle.  Tempting."

34588,best NFL player,Love all the threads recently about Jerry Rice being the GOAT when Tom Brady exists.
58865,best perfume,"I will! There is a local store that carries them. Sounds gorgeous... I really love myrrh, and rice is an ""unusual"" note that can be lovely and aromatic."
17150,best iOS game,"Definitely interested. But also anxious. Good or bad, I wouldn’t resent its presence, since I don’t have to play it, but I’m curious how it’ll play on the smaller screen. Subset didn’t spend time putting FTL on the iPhone. I’m not sure how much money that saved them, but I think it was a smart call. Making it playable on the phone seems like it would be a challenge. I feel like DotE might be in a similar category."
5209,best home improvement store,"Yep, the GE LEDs at Lowes are very low quality.  I’d much rather have my selection of Cree, Philips and even EcoSmart (made by Lighting Science, a reputable company) at HD."

45858,best trick or treating candy,I read that as penises.
5883,best programming language for web development,"So, for the web-side you'll definitely need HTML5 and CSS3 first, as many users have suggested.  Thankfully, those two languages are very easy to understand and can be learned effectively in a few hours.

After that, you'll need JavaScript.  With HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, you'll have a good foundation for making web-pages/websites (w/o a back-end language like C#).

Once you know these, you could actually probably already leap into the site you're thinking of.  If you're using Visual Studio as your IDE, you can use C# to create a pre-set MVC project that has the beginnings of user account signup and signin baked in for you to play with :)"
29225,best web hosting service,I recommend nexusbytes man. That's what I use
60808,Best comedy show on Netflix,"In such a way that I felt so safe crying with him. Seriously, felt like I was home for a minute or two."
44214,best items under $100,"Just going to highjack this for a moment and let anyone who is considering trying LSD know about nbomes:

https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nbome/

These are chemicals often sold as LSD but can be fatal if taken in even normal, recreational doses. Everyone should invest in a test kit if they want to buy and use illegal substances:

EDIT: I have nothing against using nbomes if you know what you're getting and choose to take them, knowing the inherent risks. However the safety profile of 25i in particular is just whack, you could take 2 tabs and be fine one day and die the next time you take 1."
6836,best iPhone,iphone 8 in gold color. The modern A11 chip and classic post-iphone 6 design makes it my favorite smartphone.
805,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,Sweet buttery asshole.
69374,best major to study in college,Did electrical engineering. Would have minored in nuclear engineering and pursued a master's in it as well. Nuclear is just fascinating to me and the department head made the material so understandable.
68336,best science fiction novel,much obliged.

43625,best items under $100,"We've bought 2-3 Kindle Fires on prime days since amazon started doing it, mostly for our kids.  The HD8 is a hell of a little tablet for <$60"

60120,best freezer brand,Upright tends to have the edge on efficiency - and more efficiency means greater longevity.
47648,best state to visit in the United States,Let's not forget The House on the Rock.  You can get in but you can't get out.
14734,best romantic novel,"I gotta go with my all-time fave, Pride and Prejudice."
60265,best freezer brand,"My partner hemmed and hawed about getting one (I said we're probably okay either way) and by the time he decided to get one they were all gone at Costco.

Turns out the in-laws have a 9 cu ft they aren't using. But it's a bit big for our space and they're 2 hrs away. We'll see.

I've hear chest freezers are better than uprights.  A midsize would probably be best."
