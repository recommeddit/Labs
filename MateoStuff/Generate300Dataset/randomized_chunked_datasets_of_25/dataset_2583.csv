31721,"I had the Sony when it first came out because it allowed PDFs.  I thought 'hey, I can save on clutter and on money by just downloading books.'  I don't really like them.  They are good for a vacation.  Since I like to read multiple books at one time it's great not to have my backpack overloaded when I'm on a trip.  But to me there is something about them that falls short over the long term.  I love having the book in my hand.  Also most of the stuff I read is non-fiction so I'm constantly dog-earing and re-referencing material.  It still is a battle though, especially if I get free wikipedia with the Kindle.

Subset didn’t spend time putting FTL on the iPhone. I’m not sure how much money that saved them, but I think it was a smart call. Making it playable on the phone seems like it would be a challenge. I feel like DotE might be in a similar category.",best iOS game

After that, you'll need JavaScript.  With HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, you'll have a good foundation for making web-pages/websites (w/o a back-end language like C#).

Once you know these, you could actually probably already leap into the site you're thinking of.  If you're using Visual Studio as your IDE, you can use C# to create a pre-set MVC project that has the beginnings of user account signup and signin baked in for you to play with :)",best programming language for web development

These are chemicals often sold as LSD but can be fatal if taken in even normal, recreational doses. Everyone should invest in a test kit if they want to buy and use illegal substances:

EDIT: I have nothing against using nbomes if you know what you're getting and choose to take them, knowing the inherent risks. However the safety profile of 25i in particular is just whack, you could take 2 tabs and be fine one day and die the next time you take 1.",best items under $100
