"Our best players are quite old so their value isn't high, whereas bunch of younger ones don't play for top clubs. Serbia has Vlahovic and SMS probably who raise value a lot."
Color theory is a scientifically studied and peer reviewed thing.
Thank you for the breakdown.
I like chicken fingers.
"I actually tried that before buying the blackout curtains.  I had two problems:

* It was hard to keep light from coming in through all the seams between the pieces of foil.
* There was a slight air flow even when the windows were closed, so the foil made a constant quiet crinkling sound.

I'm sure I could have made it work if I kept tinkering with it, but it seemed like it would be a big hassle.  That and it just looked cheap and messy."

"Fiesta Texas needs one or 2 more big coasters. I think a GCI woodie and a Hyper of some sort would give that park one of the best lineups in the nation. Over Texas needs a modern looper, like a floorless or new gen Vekoma, along with a modern multi-launch coaster."
"Yes, charcoal is pretty messy. But I like the depth that it adds."
"Tomb Raider was a decent adventure flick, but skip Cruise's Mummy *at all costs* and watch the Brendan Fraser ones instead."
"Datacamp has the most solid collection of absolute-beginner to mid-level-but-not-in-depth content Iâ€™ve seen on data science to date. A lot of courses are taught by the people who created the popular packages theyâ€™re teaching you about. I recommend Rosalind more for a comparable self-learning collection for bioinformatics specifically though. I pay for Datacamp because Iâ€™m a big fan of the format for efficient bursts of interactive learning, itâ€™s super easy and kinda fun to blaze through a 4 hour course on the weekend on a topic I feel Iâ€™m not quite solid on. Is it suitable for deep dives? Hell no. Can it help you think about common problems in your field and jump-start your problem-solving kit when youâ€™re not yet senior level? Yeah, I think so."
"This album imo defines ""front to back"" masterpiece.  Every song is interconnected with the theme and the crossreferences of lyrics among tracks is pure genius."
"Awesome. Follow up question: would it be possible to create two sets of rankings, one for home and one for away matches? There are some teams where I think there would be a large discrepancy between the two. 

Looking forward to the interactive rankings, it will be awesome to be able to manipulate the data yourself."

"Chem/bio labs use 95% ethanol all the time. above that and there's a good chance that there's benzene in it as a drying agent, so don't drink the 99.99% lab grade ethanol."
