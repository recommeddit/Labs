"BÃ¼rgenstock looks amazing, will give that a try. What would you recommend in Portugal?"
"There is nothing like the best browser. In my experience , Edge is snappier compared to other Chromium based browsers. Firefox has introduced a slew of privacy features in recent times. May be try Firefox

I use Vivaldi because I like the features it offers. But not the fastest one"
Aaaaagreed!!!!
">It does if you use an ad blocker. Brave promotes users to view ads by paying them. And it allows users to support sites without viewing ads via contributions. Is that correct

Exactly.  Ad blockers are not going away... 25% of people in the US use them and that number is only going to grow.  Brave gives users choice, added privacy, more targeted impressions for advertisers (to users who have actually agreed to seeing them and without sacrificing your private data), while maintaining an ecosystem that pays publishers a larger share of ad revenue.... It encourages users to give back to their favorite creators with either their own contributions (patreon-like) for those who wish to keep ads blocked, OR without even having to contribute their own money...rather their attention."
"I can handle both ways. I have a serious bag ðŸ¤£.
Actually it's kinda funny because I'm not a computer gamer but my current 8gb ram lenovo can't handle the pressure of programming in multiple languages simultaneously.
My main(and almost only) usage is programming, sometimes music or netflix."
"Out of state tuition here does suck, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming here from out of state. That being said out of state tuition is on par with the cost of a private school, and the UCs are better than all but the best private schools."
TPB is great but it definitely took me a few episodes to really get into it.  If it weren't for the effuse praise it gets online I probably would have given up 2 or 3 episodes in.  But once it gains its footing its a really hilarious Canadian comedy.
"I'm looking for a wireless gaming headset that allows simultaneous bluetooth.  It seems that means only the GSP670, the JBL Quantum 800, and the Arctis Pro Wireless.  I'd like at least decent mic quality and sound quality.  What would you recommend?"

"I just searched for [Classic Margarita Recipes](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/04/classic-margarita-recipe-tequila-cocktail.html) and found the linked one.  Would you say the one you drink is comparable?  What kind of tequila do you think would fall into the ""quality tequila"" stipulation mentioned in the note on the recipe?"
"Whatever you do make sure to add a blender ball or something to the vessel you store it in, this sort of smoothie will separate in a very unappetizing fashion if you wait longer than an hour to drink it."
The world absolutely needs more of people like you
One severely underrated feature of Imagus is the hold right click to keep the picture/video on screen. Great for videos especially.
A shot of dark rum and a lot of complaining
"Oh God, Romancing the Stone for sure."
Why for the love of all that's good sir did you not reveal yourself a week ago before I'd spent $200+ on an ill-advised venture.... Mixed emotions cause I'm happy to find this but inevitably remorseful from the  knowledge that I've learnt from it.
God damn those bastards are everywhere
