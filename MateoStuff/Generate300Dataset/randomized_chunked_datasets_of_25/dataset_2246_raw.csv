"They have an indoor pool???  It was raining when we were there, I would have loved their pool. The spa has a rain room where it rains warm rain that starts out slow and eventually becomes torrential. 
Did you see the Grandmother Clock?

I read Punk 57 last week and oh boy it was great! I have Birthday Girl on my list. I love all the angst! Thank you üíú
Digimon Cyber Slueth. They are turn based with depth.  Lots of talking but a very addicting jrpg
Fuck yeah?
"He does love his dad jokes! 

I think he might kill me if I get a mug because he says we have too many. I like collecting them. 

I've thought about just leaving him alone and getting him some beers."
Tenet. Its another Nolan movie and at multiple times reminded me of Inception
"Baking soda is not abrasive to tooth enamel, but is abrasive to a lot of the surface contamination you want to remove when you brush, so it's a fairly good in-between texture for brushing.  Another good thing about it is that it raises the pH in your mouth, which helps neutralize acidic etching of tooth enamel.

note:  I actually worked in the R&D lab that developed a popular baking soda tooth paste."
http://libgen.org/ has some as well
"Not trying to be a pedantic a-hole and I didn't downvote you, but these strike me as almost strictly ""action"" without the ""adventure"" aspect. When I think of adventure I think of a bigger quest like Indy, LOTR, The Mummy, etc."

But I think they only jump from 10000 ft - they are a small cessna dropzone.
I'd like to think this is true it makes the ending less sad
My father in law said the same thing when it opened.
"Because Santa Ana just ‚ÄúSanta Ana‚Äôd.‚Äù  

If he had listened to his generals, or at least been a little less of an arrogant asshat, he *would* have steam-rolled over the Texians. 

But he felt he knew best, and made a ton of stupid decisions while fighting the rebels.  

He was also more accustomed to the rebellions in Mexicans states in southern part of Mexico.  Those rebellions weren‚Äôt very well organized, and *way* more poorly armed than the Texians were.  

My *cat* could have probably led the Mexicans to victory in those states.   

Texians, on the other hand, were better armed, had some combat experience, and were comparatively well-organized.  

Santa Ana could have still crushed the Texians, of course.  But he picked a lot of tactics that he thought were ‚Äúcute‚Äù but not very sound in the situation he was in."
TY :) they look great
"There's an air bubble inside the egg at the top or bottom.  Wack the egg gently on the counter to crack the top- you can do both sides if you want.  When you find the air bubble, start peeling the egg under cool water coming from a faucet."
I love both of these and I am leaving for a trip to a cabin so this is getting a try.

"Apple trees. In case it's not obvious, it's because they make apples. Apples are delicious. Most other trees just sit there, maybe make lawnmower shrapnel (pinecones) at best..."
"They usually smell of semen, unicorns and kitties."
"See also [How To Make A Blockbuster Movie Trailer](https://youtu.be/KAOdjqyG37A).  It actually  manages to get me somewhat hype, which I guess proves their point."
