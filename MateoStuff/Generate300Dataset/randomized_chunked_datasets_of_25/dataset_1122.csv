I am treating a 404 as unexpected and as such, an error.

You are treating it as expected, and thus “another state”.",axios alternatives reddit

I am going to try Salick, Webmage, and Retrieval Artist and you might want to try—

My second favourite series is the Leary and Mundy series by David Drake.

Others I like-

Honor Harrington and Starfire and Dahak by David Weber.

Troy Rising by John Ringo

Lost Fleet by Jack Campbell. I love the Lost Stars spinoff, it is on my reread list.

Deathstalker by Simon R Green.

Star Voyager by William Forstchen

Prelude to Dune by Brian Herbert, despite not liking Dune by his father.

Star of the Guardians and Mag-Force by Margaret Weis.

Red Rising by Pierce Brown

If you don't have any other extensions, you MUST have this one. (I showed this to an old man at work one time and he called me a freeloader, so be careful)

[BitWarden](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb?hl=en) is another essential one. It is a password vault and it is open source. It does not require you to buy anything, it gives you access to all features for free, and it is encrypted with military-grade encryption. My preferred password-keeping app. You can easily import data from any other password-keeping app.
