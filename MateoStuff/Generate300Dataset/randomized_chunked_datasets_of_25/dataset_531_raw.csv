Aquafina is awful! Tastes like chlorine minus the water
"My favourite cheap perfume was Taylor Swift Enchanted Wonderstruck. Itâ€™s probably my favourite perfume Iâ€™ve ever owned. It got discontinued I think and now itâ€™s selling for $70-$100 :( 

If anyone knows a close dupe Iâ€™m all ears!"
"Hey thanks for sticking with the series and I'm glad you like how things wrapped up. IIRC The Crown Conspiracy (book #1 of that series was written in 2002, so yeah many moons ago. I hope I've improved and keep improving. That's part of what's great about writing there is always more to learn and do."
"Serious question: what about bidirectional charging is so appealing? Not only will the majority of infrastructure not support it, but the battery inside the vehicle wonâ€™t power much for long. Seems a little too gimmicky to meâ€¦something that sounds cool but really isnâ€™t practical and wonâ€™t be used."
"A hug.  

Not So Ninja edit: not one dad cares about 'presents', all we want is a 'gift', and there's a big difference !  
We just want what we want every day: a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

To me fathers day has no meaning, because it'd be sad if your kid would only think about you on that one day. Luckily, no kid ever does that, they love you all year around, so just give us a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

And they almost all do.  
That's what being a dad and your child is about.  

And, Michelle, if you read this: I love you too."
"A leaf sounds like a good option for you for commuting and general errand running. You probably can just make do with a regular outlet.

Oh and if your work is moving to just 2 miles over, have yo considered biking?"
The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) holds up so well...great swordplay.

"My mom went through a big rough patch when i was between 11 and 17. honestly, i was a little shit.  i'm 23 now and she is seriously my best friend.  not a day goes by that we don't talk on the phone and she knows pretty much everything. don't worry someday you'll get there ;)"

Are the cars in GT Sport had to handle?
"Social media can work to your advantage because, among other things, it can help extend your personal and professional network.

Twitter is generally pretty popular among the dev community as a broadcast and interaction medium.

I'd also suggest creating a github account. Having code samples easily available is generally quite helpful.

Linked in is also a good idea.

Facebook really depends on how you use it. I'd honestly suggest keeping it friends only for most of your content if you use it."

"Do you think that people are incapable of playing more complicated games or something?

My first modern hobby game was Agricola and I had no trouble with it. I had played Catan and Carcassonne before that, but nothing like Agricola.

Give people some more credit."
Yeah I steam my eggs in ~1cm of water and they peel easily
