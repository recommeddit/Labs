31274,best country to live in,"I've visited a couple countries, but honestly I'd still rather live in the US. The reason being that if I want to approximate the stuff I like about other countries, I can in the US. Mostly small stuff like food. But I can't transpose the things I like about the US to other countries. Like guns, classic cars, wide open spaces, relatively freer society and that other stereotypically American bullshit that I actually really like."

36179,best alcoholic drink,"Next time you do it, try ""fat-washing"" the whiskey.  It'll impart the bacon flavor but remove the unappealing greasiness of the residual fat.

In a mixing bowl or large jar, mix a cup of liquid bacon fat in a liter of whiskey.  Stir, cover, and let it sit at room temperature for at least 6 hours, but not more than 3 days; try making a couple batches to see how strong you like the flavor.  Put the covered vessel in the freezer.  The fat will solidify and you'll be able skim it.  Finally, strain it through a washed paper coffee filter.  ""Washed"" means rinse the paper with clean boiling water to avoid the paper flavor.

It's not a spur-of-the-moment thing, but you can make as much of it as you want, and it'll keep practically forever, so make a big batch and enjoy at your leisure."

72870,best Linux distro,"There is no such thing as ""the best distro"". There may be good or bad choices for a certain use case but since use cases and personal preferences can vary widely, the ideal distro is different depending on the person and what they want to do.

Example: I use Void, Linux Mint, Debian and Ubuntu Server. None of them are better than the other ones imo (okay, Ubuntu is worse but I have no favorite among the others).
- Void on my laptops because they have limited resources.
- Mint on my main PC and most other devices I happen to use because it has a nice user experience ootb so I don’t have to spend time on setting up everything.
- Debian and Ubuntu Server on my servers (switching away from Ubuntu soon)."
66048,best college in california,"The horrible people that attend lowly state schools don’t obtain the resources or connections to spread their awful and self-interested ideas. Besides, schools like Harvard overwhelmingly cater to the richest and most powerful of our country, it’s not like it’s a representative sample of our population. And it’s no surprise when children of multi-millionaires make careers out of keeping and expanding their wealth at the expense of so many others."
51533,best iphone case,"Caudabe Sheath.  Slimmest case that actually offers 6.6' drop protection.  Very slim and very grippy, without sticking in your pocket like silicone.  I tried a bunch of cases, and this and the Slik Kung-fu Grip are the only two I kept.  I use the Slik at my dirty shop because it's even grippier and has a bit more protection."

24533,best anime,"> it felt like a prologue to the actual story

That's basically what it is. The manga really, *really* opens up, and the story hits its stride not a couple chapters after where the anime leaves off."
