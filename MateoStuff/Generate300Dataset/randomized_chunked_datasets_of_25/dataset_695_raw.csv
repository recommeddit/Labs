"Dad joke book, or just a joke book?

If either, google 'man with no arms and no legs jokes'"

"I'm very good at convincing people of a particular cause as well as very good at understanding people's motivations.

I'm excellent in sales. I can practically sell anyone on any idea - if I try hard enough.

This is why I'm getting involved in Grant Writing - which I think I will enjoy more. I get to help people, without surrendering to political systems.. like you said."
Various different stypes of beer from IPAs to stouts and porters. Ale when I'm in the mood. Of course I'm also quite partial to a nice glass of scotch or bourbon but it's stronger so I wouldn't necessarily drink that as often. I do love a a good Manhattan though!
"Thank you! A lot of people have a hard time realizing this. After you get some experience under your belt, employers will look at that rather than your degree. 

I know a few people that have non-computer related degrees, but work in large data centers or are network admins, because they have tons of experience and know-how. The Computer field is definitely one of the biggest fields in which experience will trump a degree nine times out of ten."

"I picked up a pair of the lunar tempo 2s recently and I've been very impressed! They feel almost as nice to run in as my Zantes and Kinvaras, and I really love the feel of the upper."
">Expeditionary force was pretty interesting until Skippy ruined it. 

Damn, I'm just reading that now. Heh.

(I also could not get into Hyperion.)"
"Eh depends on the time of the year and day you go. Obviously rides like the dragster will pretty much always have long lines but if you go during down season and late at night its so much improved.  For instance on less busy days I can typically get on the millenium force in 45 minutes, raptor in 25-30 and wicked twister, power tower, gemini, max air, and magnum xl somewhere around 15. Ones like corkscrew, blue streak or matterhorn are obviously short. On the other hand rides like the dragster and maverick are always long (also weirdly some like iron dragon), and during halloweekends its so bad. Just depends on when you go"
I ordered the golden brown wallet for the same reason. I think it's the only leather color that matches the Sierra Blue nicely.
I second the vote for New Balance. I buy them pretty much exclusively and would like to know the difference between X and Y shoe.
Just wondering if it's practice to get one of these books as an audiobook?
Funny thing was that autotuned woodchipper was meant to shred autotuned woodchippers.
"It's not on Netflix, but there have been some great suggestions so far of ones that are so I'll toss it out there:  [Triangle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17XqBdCiHOI)"
Stage management major here. Every graduating stage manager in my program is already going into a kickass job. All of the graduating actors..... eh...
Agree and an overall very good movie.
"8-Bit Guy & Techmoan. Even if you're not interested in vintage computing or audio components, these two are so passionate and have such a laid back way of presenting their knowledge that it's enjoyable."
"And Tigger has ADHD, Rabbit is OCD, Piglet has social anxiety, Pooh is obese, Kanga is a single mother, and Christopher Robin is schizophrenic."
"Ashville,NC and Knoxville, TN. In appalachia. Great hiking biking in summer and skiing in winter. Both growing fast too."
That's been the case almost everywhere I go.
That only exacerbated the problem!
Was gonna say this aswell + riders of the storms
