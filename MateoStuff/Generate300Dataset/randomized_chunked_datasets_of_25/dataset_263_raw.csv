"Personally, I think an RPG is a game that has clear roots in table top RPGs like D&D, etc. Not just a fantasy setting, but some form of character attributes, stats and leveling up systems.

IMO."

Fashion design major here! Sometimes people tell me I should have done something more useful like merchandising haha
"Some good lists in here. I would say a good starter kit is **Codenames**, **Ethnos**, and **Forbidden Desert**. Accommodates a wide range of player counts, givers you a good entry point to several different genres that are still regularly enjoyed in my collection, and has a diversity of theme so you aren't playing the same thing over and over again."
Sea salt and caramel ftw
"but if youre well armed and a good shot, and people like to follow you, youve got a shot at running large parts of Somalia!! easy peasy!!"
I will always upvote a post with Skiing Yeti Mountain in it!
No more fingerprints or glare. Although I did mean to order tempered glass and wasn’t paying attention and talking and ended up with these.
Huh. Unexpected. Could I convince you otherwise? I mean maybe your man just isn't getting it done for you. Convincing you HD is better I mean.

"""Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom""

The PC version of this game is *COMPLETELY* different from the console versions. The Gamecube version was a solid platformer, and the PC version is a mediocre adventure game."
I have one of their Ultra impact cases on my 12 pro max and love it! Ordered another one for 13 but won’t be here til sometime in October ☹️ bought a cheap amazon one in the meantime cuz naked phones make me nervous
Oh this sounds good because I'm a videographer myself so a story with photographers I might be able to relate to. I'm excited.
Appreciate your in-depth reviews!

Terminator 2. Right from the get go it's non stop action. Basically a 2 and a half chase movie
"Thanks! Yeah I think my neighbors are really nice. I don't think they'll raise asshole kids. I'm not super worried about TP. Just want to make sure I'm a decent neighbor myself. I don't want kids growing up saying ""you know who gave out the worst candy? Famousmodel. His house sucked!"""
"I’m in Fargo. We put a ginkgo in our front yard that is doing really well. 

Our neighbors have a several year old birch clump that is also thriving. That’s a pretty common planting around here that grows quickly and looks good even while young.

Whatever you choose, I recommend rabbit protection. They ruin so much ornamental vegetation during the winter time. We have a sweet 16 (u of mn cultivar) apple tree that is finally recovering from being eaten nearly to the ground (but above the graft)"
