Oh yeah! Let me add that one also. Good suggestion!
"Some friends of mine (two different couples) have been to Excellence Resorts in Punta Cana more than once and really seem to love it. One of these couples can afford to go anywhere they please yet they go back to this place often. 

Unfortunately I can't tell you from personal experience how this resort is because my first trip there isn't until December. I used bookit.com and was able to secure 7 days with air from Atlanta and airport transfers for under $1400. Yes, it is a lot of money for sure but unlimited alcohol and non-motorized water sports are also included. Too, bookit.com offers the Bill Me Later payment plan if chunking out that much at once is a consideration."

"AppleCare+, i.e., none. 

Once you go caseless, you’ll never go back. It’s like not having to use a condom in a long-term relationship while on birth control."

Love Lettering by Kate Clayborn. I loved this book so damn much that I'm actually hesitant to recommend it sometimes lest someone dislike it! I can normally deal with someone not liking a fave but I loved it too much for that lol.

This is great and all but I cant sleep for shit when im sick.
"My current top 10 (whatever that’s worth). Have fun with all the lists. In no particular order. All of them are notable providing great experience throughout the years. 

1.	Codenames - A smart word game that’s sweet from 3-8 players in my experience. Vanilla and Pictures are solid. Skip the rest. 
2.	Monikers - Taboo meets Charades with some fun pop and internet references for cards
3.	Kingdomino - A fascinating quick tile placement game. 
4.	Secret Hitler - A great social deduction game for 5-10 players. 
5.	Camel Up - My favorite betting game with fascinating movements. 
6.	Android Netrunner Revised Core Set - This is a great complex 2 player cyber punk game. Lots of variety out of the box and balanced well after years of exploring this ruleset. Will also plug in Star Wars Destiny 2-player Game. Two copies will give some clashes beware the money pit of collecting this game. 
7.	Pandemic Iberia - one of the best versions of pandemic there is (next season 1, but only has a finite number of plays). More open ended options to prevent things and make things. A gorgeous game to look at with great art direction. 
8.	Ra - Has a similar feel to Camel Up but features a nice auction/push your luck mechanism that keeps everyone involved. Egyptian themed.  
9.	Samurai - A slick tile placement game where you capture pieces on the board. Has a japanese theme. Really gorgeous to look at in the end with an uniquely shaped board  
10. Rhino Hero Super Battle - Should add a dexterity game. This one is funny. You build a city of card houses and place small wooden figures on them.  I’ve considered Crokinole but too expensive. Other games I’ve considered is Loopin Louie, Flick Em Up, Junk Art, and the original Rhino Hero, but yeah. Going to go with the latest dexterity game that has my attention right now."
I came here to say this.  One of the strangest premises for a film I've ever seen.  I couldn't help but be distracted throughout the film though by that one guy's resemblance to The Rock.
"You should check online for some of the major cities near you. For example, I didn’t have a local library card but I found I could get a Houston library e-card online. And I have been able to use it for Overdrive and Hoopla to check out ebooks and media. You could even try Houston, I can’t remember if there was a state requirement or anything for it."
"A good neighbor will participate in a neighborhood watch program.

Put little notes in each trick-or-treaters basket that says 'come over any time. i'm always here from 8-3 in case you feel like skipping school.'

Then watch your neighbors."
"I was thinking the same. The title of article even says ""restaurants""!!! I think it's most likely a paid placement article... that or someone on the Eater staff shagged one of the bartenders at TP.

BTW - TP is owned by the group that owns Good Lion and Shaker Mill"
"Murder, She Wrote is easy.  It's always Jessica Fletcher.  You just need to work out who she's framed for it"
"Make a video of you packing the bag, then close it with a numbered seal similar to those used to seal semi truck trailers. Take a photo of you checking it into the airport and it going on the checked bag area, with the numbered seal clearly visible and readable on video. The seal will be removed by TSA and you will have video evidence that your item was in fact in the bag when it was taken into the checked bag area.


Huge pain in the ass though."
