6631,best iPhone,"Some weird responses here. If money is a concern then the iPhone 11 will meet all your criteria and will be officially supported by Apple for at least four more years, although will probably last you longer. If price isnâ€™t a concern then youâ€™ll want to wait until the new iPhone comes out next month and buy any one of those with the newest chip on day one. It will likely be officially supported for around 7 years, but you could probably squeeze 10 years if youâ€™re content with no security updates after ~7."
12025,best gifts for dad,"Man those kind of gifts can just destroy me emotionally. When I was younger I was a real nerd and I would help my classmates study because I just had a really good time making study packs and explaining what they needed to know and I felt like it also helped me study. I had a couple friends who really needed some help and I spent ages with them studying for their test.

One of the girls invited me over to hers to hang out so we got in the car but she said we needed to drop something off at the other girls house. She opened the door and they both just turned to me and said OK so we lied we just really wanted to give you this and she handed me a Xena warrior princess box set which I didn't even know they remembered I liked. Instantly started crying at the gesture, it was such a pretty box, too. Thing is I was also looking to buy it but I couldn't find it cheap enough to ship where I was! I'm still friends with those girls a decade later."

We met these people at the park and they said their son likes dogs and asked if he could meet Riley and I said sure.

She let him touch her nose and muzzle and ears, she definitely knew she needed to be gentle kind and patient with him, it was very sweet.
