I get why a lot of people like it but honestly I would probably put it in the middle at best. We all have different reasons why we like them and don’t like them, I guess.",best Marvel movie

32155,"The two best hotels I've ever stayed at:

1. Abbeyglen Castle Hotel in Connemara, Ireland. 

I was traveling by myself and found a great deal for $67/night in the off-season. The room was beautiful, common areas were cozy, owner was super welcoming, and the breakfast and afternoon tea were among the best I've had. It's not a ""luxury"" castle, but rather a warm, comfortable one. 

2. The Beach Club at Walt Disney World. 

I wish I could stay here every time I go to Disney! What makes this hotel amazing is the location; it's  on the Boardwalk, and it's walking distance to Epcot. Watching Illuminations and then strolling around the moonlit lake back to your room is the best feeling ever. It also has an incredible pool, and the rooms are really nice. I can't wait until I can afford to stay here again.",best hotel to live in

48388,"I've been looking for a gray for my new (EEEE) house! We close Monday and will (probably) start paint next week. This gray looks perfect!!

I have a small wall with a sliding glass door (can get a pic if needed) and was thinking about doing a darker gray to compliment. Do you have a dark gray that would go with this?

Also, I've been unsure about doing the WHOLE house in one color (the kitchen walls (few) and breakfast/eating nook are a navy, which I intend to keep), which would include bedrooms.... I like grays, but I also like colors. BUT this gray seems so faint enough that I could literally change textiles and patterns and it'd go with anything. Is that the same feeling you get?",best color to paint with

43104,"[A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283205/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39) is exactly what you're asking for. It stars a charming Tim Hutton and a cast that are mostly brand new characters from week to week. It's set in the late '40's (I think), so there's a bit of that film noir aspect and cool gargantuan cars. The stories do a nice job of taking you through the process of solving the case, with Hutton doing a lot of leg work to develop information as the show proceeds. IIRC, they never do the last-minute reveal like Agatha Christie often does.",best detective show

They also make clear tpu versions with very little front screen lip. Both of them are in the photo stash so see if they fit your needs. 

Ringke standard designs have raised fronts so that wouldn’t be a choice. Check them out if you change your mind",best iphone case
