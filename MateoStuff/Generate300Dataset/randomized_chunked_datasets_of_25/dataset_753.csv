38107,best Marvel movie,"This is pretty much my top. Idk why but I super hated infinity war. I’ve watched it a few times and I just felt like the pacing was poor and it felt so disorganized. I get why a lot of people like it but honestly I would probably put it in the middle at best. We all have different reasons why we like them and don’t like them, I guess."
35473,best alcoholic drink,"For real though, any vodka mixed roght with mountain dew is decent"
32897,best energy drink,Sugar free rockstar / sugar free Red Bull / cotton candy Rockstar
21097,best workout music,"I'm a big Kanye fan [Blood on the Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9os5qNv_RI) is perfect for a warm up. It starts off slow and then when the beat hits, I start lifting. I love that beat."
34460,best NFL player,Why the downvotes?
32155,best hotel to live in,"The two best hotels I've ever stayed at:

1. Abbeyglen Castle Hotel in Connemara, Ireland. 

I was traveling by myself and found a great deal for $67/night in the off-season. The room was beautiful, common areas were cozy, owner was super welcoming, and the breakfast and afternoon tea were among the best I've had. It's not a ""luxury"" castle, but rather a warm, comfortable one. 

2. The Beach Club at Walt Disney World. 

I wish I could stay here every time I go to Disney! What makes this hotel amazing is the location; it's  on the Boardwalk, and it's walking distance to Epcot. Watching Illuminations and then strolling around the moonlit lake back to your room is the best feeling ever. It also has an incredible pool, and the rooms are really nice. I can't wait until I can afford to stay here again."

28442,best breakfast foods,*the neighbors roll their eyes as they hear me screeching while downing a whole bottle of sriraha like I always do at 5:00 am*

48388,best color to paint with,"I've been looking for a gray for my new (EEEE) house! We close Monday and will (probably) start paint next week. This gray looks perfect!!

I have a small wall with a sliding glass door (can get a pic if needed) and was thinking about doing a darker gray to compliment. Do you have a dark gray that would go with this?

Also, I've been unsure about doing the WHOLE house in one color (the kitchen walls (few) and breakfast/eating nook are a navy, which I intend to keep), which would include bedrooms.... I like grays, but I also like colors. BUT this gray seems so faint enough that I could literally change textiles and patterns and it'd go with anything. Is that the same feeling you get?"
28402,best breakfast foods,"I mean cooking that much doesn't take as long as it seems, but it bothers me when that happens in a super clean kitchen with 1 pan. LIKE HOW THE FUCK YOU MAKE WAFFLES WITH NO MAKER? You mean to tell me you cooked all this shit to go with eggos?"
22402,best celebrity,"I saw Tom Hiddleston at LAX and I just froze like a deer in the headlights. He’s arguable the most regal human I’ve ever seen, he’s also way taller than I expected."
66794,best soccer team in the world,Sorry I meant defender not CB
43104,best detective show,"[A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283205/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39) is exactly what you're asking for. It stars a charming Tim Hutton and a cast that are mostly brand new characters from week to week. It's set in the late '40's (I think), so there's a bit of that film noir aspect and cool gargantuan cars. The stories do a nice job of taking you through the process of solving the case, with Hutton doing a lot of leg work to develop information as the show proceeds. IIRC, they never do the last-minute reveal like Agatha Christie often does."
61844,Best RPG game on PS4,"I've been playing it for almost two years and I did stop for a few months until the Morrowind DLC came out. Honestly I like it but I do not really do any PVP, just quests and leveling up and hoarding stuff. I enjoy it. But I think I will start playing Nier again. Only played it for 2 hours and dropped it."
33287,best electric car,"Isn't that the bare bones, commercial Lightning which starts at the lowest price?  Is that the one you plan on getting?

I think the battery backup feature is only for the highest end Lightning trim."
1108,best ice cream flavor,Pistachio ice cream made with whole cream and egg yolks.
8774,best toothpaste,"Waterpick ***FILLED WITH LISTERINE***? 

Someone's got a masochism fetish..."
54530,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Ok cool. Thanks a lot!
37615,best Marvel movie,It’s not possible for everyone to agree on an order
41324,best instrument to play,"Harp or a hang drum. 
Everyone knows the harp it's very peaceful. The hang drum is more exciting and new-age yet feels familiar."
30284,best Mexican war to study,It's not really talked about as much. It's mostly overshadowed by the Civil War.
51804,best iphone case,"Depending on your preference, the baseus offerings may meet your needs. The matte frosted version is as thin as totallee, with button cutouts, but also an ever so slight lip up front to make sure the case doesn’t come off too easily. 

They also make clear tpu versions with very little front screen lip. Both of them are in the photo stash so see if they fit your needs. 

Ringke standard designs have raised fronts so that wouldn’t be a choice. Check them out if you change your mind"
