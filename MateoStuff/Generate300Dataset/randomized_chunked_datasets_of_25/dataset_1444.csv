33934,"IMO, the creativity and fun spirit of Pokemon was gone after Gen 3. Pokemon became just another corporate moneymaker with orders to churn out content and make cash.

I played Fire Red as an adult, and found that it managed to hold my attention, even after years of my tastes in video games maturing.",best Pokemon game
