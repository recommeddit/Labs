"with an electric toothbrush you're not supposed to make circles. just slowly move it over the tooth surface.  


the engineering side of me says ""if it moves up and down 20,000 times a second... my moving it back and forth over my teeth at 1 time per second isn't going to affect the localized motion of the toothbrush tip."""
I don't know how well a bunny would do with a small child... from what I have heard it is surprisingly easy to overstress or mishandle a rabbit and cause its death.
"There are a lot more solutions people can choose from that the OP hasn’t listed. I agree that SiteGround is good and BlueHost is decent. DreamHost is another well-known one but it’s not one that I’d personally use. I’ve used GreenGeeks and BlueHost in the past, but these were only for ‘side hustle’ projects. For my main projects I use SiteGround. Now the thing with both BlueHost and GreenGeeks is that they’re good for those little side hustle projects you undertake for clients. You get unlimited subdomains and email accounts, they charge monthly AND you can lock yourself into a 3-year contract if you want to grab the discount (this is what I eventually did when I realised it was worth it). I also have a buddy who paid $150 for 2 years and got 1.5GB of ram. The only restriction was that his INODES were capped at - don’t quote me on this - 300k. Maybe a bit more. Anyhow, they also do 1-click installs of WP."
I'll get him something this year to show the amount of care he's put into being a part of my life: absolutely nothing. I'm glad people have good dads to celebrate on Father's Day but mine's a piece of shit who chose my step mom and her kids over my brother and me. I thought I was making things right with my relationship with him after not being in contact much for a long time. Then he refused to show up to my wedding. Done.

It's a shame, did you get any response from them?"
"[Lehman's](https://www.lehmans.com/) for old-school, working farmhouse stuff. [Townsend's](https://www.townsends.us/) is for American Colonial reenactment, but I wish I could build a small house and fill it with everything they sell."
"Make your breath smell nice, mostly. Some of them do contain other surfactants (foamy stuff - the main one in conventional toothpastes is sodium laureth sulfate or SLS). Surfactants help clean but they’re mostly there because we expect our toothpastes to lather up."
"Right now I'm a freshman and sharing your opinions, it's boring and demands hard working, so I will definetely switch, I like many fields, but yet this drained my energy, I've lost my spark, there's no longer any ambition. I feel lost and don't know where to switch. What are you doing now?"

"i strongly recommend dragon age: inquisition if you haven't played yet. it has lots of similarities with skyrim but with better gameplay and graphics. story is a mega banger too.
and if you are up for the challenge or rather change in gaming style definitely play bloodborne and dark souls 3.
and there is nioh1 and 2 which are the best souls clone games. 
recently I've played divinity: original sin2 and although it's painfully slow at first few hours but definitely on of the best rpg games ever made."
"I hope you find some interesting anime to watch!

I like most of what I've seen from the top 100."
"If someone just needs a laptop for streaming, browsing, and light office work (word processing, etc), then you don’t (really) need a dedicated graphics card or even a monster processor. You’ll find a lot of deals on here targeted to those things (dedicated gpus and newest cpus). 

The more important factors would probably be how this person wants to use the laptop. 

Will they be hooking it up to external monitors/tvs? If so, need to look at the ports to make sure that lines up with what they need. 

Will they be traveling with it a lot? If so, they may care about how thin it is and how much it weighs. 

Using it on the go? Battery life is likely to be important.

It’s hard to say without knowing the answers to those questions, but in all honesty you likely want to look at some thin, mobile, computers made by Asus, acer, or gateway. I would recommend Asus of those brands, but you can find good deals all over the place."
"Sandqvist back packs. It's a Swedish brand with nice looking bags, similar to Herschel in the design but with a higher quality."
"I'm gonna say probably a man, somewhere in your 30s, fairly well situated in your career which is something managerial. You live in a big city and you enjoy all of the many opportunities of the big city, like the night life, music, museums, etc."
My gf buys me and her bamboo toothbrushes that can be recycled of even composted if you pull the bristles out. Woot for no plastic waste!
harmonica. also known as the mouth organ.
Me too. I've never really seen any difference in them other than the color and location. I go to the one that's closest.
"Answer door naked, or atleast with your penis out. Invite children inside, offer to give them baths or help them shower, that's typical halloween etiquette."
