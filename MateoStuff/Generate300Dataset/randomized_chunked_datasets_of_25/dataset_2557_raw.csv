"Peter Parker: Tobey Maguire

Spider-Man: Andrew Garfield"
"Yep, the first series of the patreon was the MCU in its entirety from Iron Man to Spider-Man: Far From Home. They’re all fun listens! Especially the ones where I felt I had a different opinion on the movies."
Thanks.  You saved me some money.

"If their patch cycle for mobile and PC was exact then I’d find it better cause I liked moving my save between, but for one Dev and the quality, I have 0 complaints. Agree with you though, a bit better on PC."
"I watched the trailer of that, and the first comment I saw spoiled it. So sad :("
"The order changes often except for LLA, but:

A$AP Rocky - LIVE.LOVE.A$AP 

Travis Scott - Rodeo

Kanye West - Late Registration 

Freddie Gibbs & Madlib - Pinata 

Danny Brown - XXX

Honourable Mention: Playboi Carti's self titled, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World, Section.80 by Kendrick Lamar"
Otf x 4pf album of the year fasho. 1 2 3 4 5 got it locked up. Threads over bye
"1. None of them really, but I’ll say Tobey Maguire.  He felt the most accurate.

2. Tom Holland.  Love his jokes and enthusiasm as Spidey.  

3. Andrew Garfield.  Love his spider-like movements

4. Andrew Garfield, no question.  That opening to his second movie was great.

5. Toney Maguire. Harry, Jameson, Aunt May...all great.

6. Andrew Garfield.  His reactions to Uncle Ben / Gwen dying are so emotional.  

7. Tobey Maguire.  He had good character development each movie.

8.  Probably Maguire for Spider-Man 2, but I do have a lot of fun with Homecoming

9. Andrew Garfield, for the death of Gwen Stacy

10. Andrew Garfield for the ASM2 theme

11. Tom Holland.  I love his performances, just hate the writing for his movies.  He would make a perfect traditional Spider-Man."
"That's the reason I would pick Charmander, really. It sucks that later games didn't use the starters as a kind of in-world easy/medium/hard mode selection."
You could have a look at all the nominated ones to see if you’ve read all those?
"That almost happened to a friend's kid. Except it was mushroom tea. Buckle up, Tucker."
"Have you seen Hulk lately? I did a complete rewatch last year when I got onto the Patreon and I could not believe how piss-poor Hulk was. It really does not come across as a quality movie in any way. Dark World and Ultron have plenty of good parts. Hulk genuinely doesn't, IMO."
"Pandorum. That twist was really an ""oh shit"" moment."
"Stan Lee, that guy was just as awesome in person. Rest in peace Stan"
"iPhone 6, crazy thin and light (all the later ones gained in thickness and weight) and loved the all aluminum chassis."
You have option to do it inside Zebra ;)
"I currently have DT990 pro 250ohms with fiio k5 pro and want to upgrade my headphones because I have a problem when gunfire appears - i cant pinpoint any footsteps. Do you think 599 will be better than dt990 pro? Also consideting hd58x, hd6xx, hifimans"
"Depends on your skin type, but I personally use Clinique for men oily skin. Face wash 2x a day, and deep scrub 2x a week. Helped with my oily skin big time. I order it online when it’s on sale and it’s decent price for high quality stuff."
"Short Wave (NPR) and This Podcast Will Kill You (Exactly Right) are some of my favorites!

Edit: TPWKY would be better for an older group that can appreciate microbio,  and they have versions of their episodes where they don't mention the cocktails they make for each ep since they know educators have used them. Short Wave has had some awesome episodes for hooks/extensions in my lessons with 6th graders."
"Ah, yeah that one. I don't like those rides but I got a good look while I waited for my friend to ride it ;-)"
*Looks around shame-faced* They're my favorite type of lollipop... especially butterscotch.
"The best houses gave chip bags, king sized candy bars, or soda."
They're both incredible.
"The idea of indepth graphs for each country is also great, maybe I can create an example graph. Dare I ask what team you suggest I look at? Other than captaincy changes is there anything else you would like to look at?"
