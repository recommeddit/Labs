21216,"When it comes to this topic I always found it more interesting to think about the *why* more than the *what*. Sure, it's always nice to see specific examples of the playlists, but the purpose behind the track is way more interesting to me.
 
Are the lyrics uplifting/motivating you in a specific way? 
Is the beat/groove something that meshes well with the movement of the exercise? Maybe there's a breakdown or tempo-change that allow you to grind it out a hair harder for the last set? 
What kind of mindset does it give you? Some like their music to be a supportive pat on the back before going at it, others may want it more as a way to whip up some aggressiveness before, or do you just want to feel like you're in a workout montage?

As for me, I am another headbanger, my workout playlist can generally be described as ""angry men playing really fast on their instruments and singing/screaming words of righteous fury"". I generally prefer having my music portray the feeling of someone going *I fucking dare you to keep up* rather than *Go for it bro, we got this!*. There are of course exceptions to this, but they are by far a minority and are mostly of the sort that evoke the aforementioned cinematic montage-feelings.

Good examples of what I'm talking about:

56458,"And I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù should be used to describe anything under 240 Hz, and since it seems like you‚Äôre insinuating that 4K should be the holy grail, none of those would make the cut for me. I‚Äôd think the holy grail of all monitors would have to be one of the 1440p 240 Hz monitors. Since the 1080p 360 Hz monitor is not that great and can‚Äôt refresh the pixels in time for true 360 Hz, that will be the new holy grail for competitive players when they release a TN version.",best desktop monitor

69816,"Choosing a degree is about finding a balance between what you will enjoy and be able to do well, and what will bring you income.

Although you don't want to study something you hate just because it will help you earn a lot, if you study something that you love that brings you no income potential, you are likely to end up doing something you hate anyway, but for much less money.

The best case scenario is that you're passionate about something that has a high probability of leading you to a high income career (e.g., Computer Science today).  But for many people this isn't a reality.

What I would do is try to as much data about the earning potential of each degree, and then work your way through the list identifying the ones that you think strike the best balance between what you enjoy and are competent at, and what have the potential to bring you high income.

Also remember that college education is not the only way to secure a well-paying career.  If you are about to go into massive debt for it, it may be worth considering alternatives (e.g., electrical work, plumbing, etc...).  Personally, I am a big fan of higher education, but I was lucky enough to be in the group where my passion correlated well with a field with high earning potential.  Having watched many friends over the years, this is not always the case.

Oh, and all that other stuff about the degree not guaranteeing you anything, and it being just as much about you working hard, and having the right natural ability and skills, etc...",best major to study in college
