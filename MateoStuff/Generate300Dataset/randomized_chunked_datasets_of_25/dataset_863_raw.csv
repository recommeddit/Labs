An electric toothbrush. Never looking back!
"I like the Dutch, they're a laid back and eminently reasonable people, and Amsterdam is fun for a weekend, but one you've got that out of your system it is one of the most boring countries on God's green earth."
"PC, PS4 Slim and Switch.

PC is a good 99% for me. I can play on either my monitors or my LG C9 OLED. I choose PC because I can play using whatever controls I want, alter FOV and co, get both better visuals and framerate. Mods if I want and if there's any worth installing.

Last two games I played on PS4 were Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last of Us Part 2. I'm excited to see more games come to PC. I ordered Days Gone's Steam key on GMG already, actually.

Exclusivity sucks, and I dislike it even more when VR gets exclusivity like how RE7 is a PSVR exclusive or Resident Evil 4 is only on Oculus Quest 2 (which I do also own though)"
"Be yourselves in the photo, she will love it even more (I hope). I'd rather have a genuine photo of the people I love than a fake smile pic."
"I'm re-reading *Pandora's Star* just now, and while I agree it has several great action scenes, I don't know that I'd describe it as ""action packed."" It's a very long book, and there's a lot of chapters which are just dialogue and exploration. Whole chunks of it are basically police-procedural, a lot of it is devoted to politics and worldbuilding. And sex, too, quite a lot of sex."
"I have no job at all coming out of college here, so it might be a while until I have free time for a hobby again.  :P  But who knows?  

thanks for the kind words, though!  :)"
Today's my 21st birthday and I need some recommendations!
i bet it's taro... asian groceries should have them
Its all bout that Double vanilla with some hot fudge. mmmmmmmmm.
"Yeah, sorry for being a typical Asian."

"Pricing aside, I'm pretty sure a long-range Model S would handle that no problem. Especially with the new front motor and a Supercharger or two along the way."
"> Does Far let me SFTP to other sites and treat them like local drives?

I am not sure. It allows for regular FTP at least and the plugin system would certainly allow for such a feature, since the FTP client is a plugin itself.

> Also, I've not found a good way to bookmark directories in Far...

This is simple: Press [F2] to bring up the user menu and press [INS] to add an item.

**Hotkey**: As a hotkey, use any letter, digit or F... key you want. I simply try to default to the first letter of the command, so for the command to go into the bat file directory, I use `b`.

**Label**: This simply is the label that is shown on the menu

**Commands**: Lines of valid CMD commands to execute. You can press [F1] and select ""Special symbols"" for some interesting variables. This is useful for example to build yourself git commands together. To bookmark a folder, simply enter `CD /D C:\your\folder\name`

Save your changes. In the future to switch to that directory, simply press [F2] and then the hotkey you assigned."

"The [Tolomeo Table Lamp](http://www.ylighting.com/art-tol-cl-led.html) by Artemide (pronounced Ahr-tim-mid-dee) is seen in almost every movie. Here it is on the desk at [NCIS](http://i.imgur.com/u2LNa.png) (pronounced Cee-ess-eye-rip-off). It is beautifully balanced, pivots and can extend pretty much to full length without tipping over or needing to clamp to the desk. This allows you to use it as a task lamp with a compact head that won't obstruct your work, or can be brought up to full height to work as a flood. There is a similar lamp at Ikea called the [Husvik](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70140257/) but I cannot vouch for its quality. The Tolomeo has won multiple awards and is in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent design collection."
Will try them out. Thanks.

"Not sarcasm. Authentic curiosity, because i am aware there is functionality that excel has that the others don't; what are some of those examples? (And in my case for what I do there has been no difference, but it is fairly simple math, just handling very BIG data.)"
"Yeah I would suggest using Firefox though. Brave still promotes the Chromium monoculture and their ad policy is parasitic, hurting small creators, in my opinion. Tbh it is a bit mafia like. Good reskin though"
"Also fake pockets - all the looks of pockets, none of the convenience."
"Team GB, led by Steven Spielberg, taking notes there."
Good tip man. Thanks!
"That’s from 2013 and you left out the key part:
>	The voting period extended from late November 2012 through early April 2013.

It’s pretty clear these rankings are taking playoff stuff in to account with how the voting is going."
Chorizzo and eggs in a burrito is pretty good
"You have really trendy perfumes! You seem to like perfumes that are sweet and gourmand that are on the dark mysterious side (ex: Initio Side Effect, Kerosine) but you also like your florals and roses . You’re in your mid 20’s (maybe 27?), you are really independent and a hard worker. You speak your mind and don’t let anybody rain on your parade because everyday is a you day! You’re very loyal to your friends who you love to spend nights out clubbing with, and you probably work in the healthcare industry"
