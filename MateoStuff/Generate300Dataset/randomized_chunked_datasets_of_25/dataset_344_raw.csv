"I use Derwent because its the only open stock available where I live, but I haven't really seen much difference between brands aside from ultra-cheap pencils which I've noticed tend to be harder and almost waxy or something."
Thunderbird's my favorite wing coaster but unless Raven is running like crap I'll go Raven every day of the week.
"Where are you getting this idea that a Wrapper/HOC is something that has to be employed to npm for people to maintain? Just write the functionality that you want and use it in your own personal app.

"Adams and Kelce are locked in for top 10 as well. No one matches the stat production of Kelce among TEs, and Adams was the best WR in 2020."
"I was in the same place you were a few months ago.  [Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/Men/Accessories/Sunglasses%20&%20Eyewear)  proved to be the solution.  Went on their website and got $200 sunglasses from Electric California for $35.  They are worlds better than any other sunglasses I‚Äôve had, even my (now-broken) Ray-Bans.  Most of the stuff you find on the Rack is extremely high quality because it‚Äôs liquidated/out-of-season products that are originally from Nordstrom.  In other words, you can get these $200 designer, fully-polarized shades for <$40 shipped.  I recently suggested some from [Timberland](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/search?query=Timberland+sunglasses), who are known for quality products."
"There are definitely a few data compilation errors there. I'll try to clean it up if I can. Perhaps you'd be interested in the raw data, [here it is](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvrSMrZ-fr5pdDNsdDBJU0ptVmRORWhtUFd5SUtnOXc&usp=sharing) in spreadsheet format."
Love Chris Broad's humor and self-mockery!

"Lmao thank you, I did my best. Might‚Äôve gotten a little tired toward the end but it‚Äôs a solid overview of my experiences with the mice."
Dental experts: Any opinion on NovaMin? I heard it's a bioglass that's supposed to rebuild tooth enamel in a different way than fluoride. I'm currently using Sensodyne repair and protect with 5%w/w NovaMin and 0.104% w/w fluoride.
"You‚Äôre welcome! You can sort the list by ‚Äúfavorited‚Äù to see which movies are the most liked by the users of the site. You‚Äôll probably see a lot of your examples near the top, and then you can go from there!"
Bullshit. Firefox never uses less than 2GB of RAM on my PC whereas chromium based browsers always hover around 800MB-1.5GB with the same extensions and tabs open.
"Yeah, like a corporation."
">Certain spores and viruses are resistant to chlorination

Holy shit, what the hell are those? How can they possibly survive chlorination?"
"Be that as it may, you did ask who was best, not who was first."
"Sileo fucks up BigBoss and a lot of other repos that work fine on Cydia (*not* referring to piracy repos)

Faster does not mean better"
"It's been a while since I made this post. Since then, I've been using brave as my rare second browser. I use a very minimalistic clean setup and brave's UI doesn't seem polished enough. But the privacy features are the reason I still have it :))"
"""Arrival"" has a very good plot twist for having a first-contact premise it covers a lot of emotions and real life scenarios."

"Just watched the endless. Every five minutes there seems to be a ‚Äúwait, what?‚Äù Moment. Really good, might watch it again to see what I missed. 

Also The One I Love has really good twists, even if it‚Äôs not a thriller."
