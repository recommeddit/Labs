"Oh it isn’t canon at all, but it’s still around unfortunately, i personal don’t mind the story it tries to tell with the Baby arc..but that’s about all that’s good from a story perspective...music and art style is really nice though."
Please don't mention my past shame. Me from years ago is very sensitive.

Socom 1 & 2 were my favorite games ever.  Nice list.
I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??
"You can get up to Halo 4 on the 360, those are great games, Halo 3 and Reach are my favorites though 4 had some great multiplayer maps and game types as well.  Call of Duty Black Ops 1 & 2 are great games on the 360 as well.  Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel are good as well."
Don't forget dragons dogma for the ps3.
I’m particularly partial to French Lilac
Yes but that would be hard in the morning when you want to drink coffee ?
That flavour will always have a special meaning to me. Kind of upset its not in Canada :(
"Hey there, I havent shopped for a laptop since 2012, so I am long removed from the game. I had a dell, and bought a chromebook a couple of years ago and hate it. 

Do you have a good summary of each brand? Acer vs Asus vs Dell vs Lenovo etc?"
"Anything that’s not something you get all the time.  Halloween candy, for me, was all about getting the weird stuff."
What's your opinion on Oliver Goldsmith sunglasses?
"Culligan, because what size bottles do you get with aquafina or fiji?  1L?  And what does that cost you?  $2.50?  Rediculous!
    
I go with Culligan, 18.5L bottles for $5 or less."
"Because from everything I can see sound wise the flight s is the same as the flight the tuning shape is unchanged it just dropped a few dB making it a more listen able headset.

The white noise should be the same as the flight."
Do you think games kills the battery health ?
"I have a question, will apple leather case for iPhone 12 get me through 3+ years which is how much time I am planning to use this phone for?"
It turned out great. Almost like an apple cobbler but not as sweet. I forgot to add cinnamon but that or honey would be an awesome addition. It was a good dessert replacement.
I actually love clothes because I hate even spending time shopping for them.  Amazon has helped some of that but not all of it.
Nice edit.
Oh my god. I am extremely buying this.
This is the way
"In general, IMO the Forza Horizon series and Forza itself are the best racing games this generation, but that's Xbox. 

On PS4, GT Sport is gorgeous and fun to play racer, it has a good selection of cars as well. This is one is definitely one of the best racers out right now. 

Project Cars 1 & 2  is geared more towards simulation and it also features a ton of cars and realistic locations. 

The Crew 1 & 2 is more like Forza Horizon, an open world racer with a lot of variety and you can race against other players. The first game is story driven, while the second one focuses solely on racing.  

Driveclub is an older title, but it's still a beautiful game and one of my all-time favorites. It has the best dynamic weather system around and it's cheap. 

I could go on, I love racing games as well and own most, if not all of them between the two consoles."
"Anything by Brandon Sanderson....if you're not sure, you can check out Warbreaker for free on his website.

Robin Hobb's Farseer Series (I'm actually getting ready to re-read that)

Wheel of Time (Robert Jordan) is great but probably not the best to start with since it is so long.

Kingkiller Chronicles (Patrick Rothfuss) is awesome but unfinished

Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks...I enjoyed it but have read mixed reviews about it.

And you can always check out /r/fantasy for more suggestions!"
