67937,best science fiction novel,"Upvote for Ringworld (and several of the sequels).  I sometimes ask people if they've read ""The Luck of Teela Brown,"" to see of they have any idea what I'm talking about.  Some do, others do only do after I say, ""or Ringworld, as it's called here."""

26838,best board games,"I got overwhelmed with the sheer number of games when I first really dove into the hobby. Luckily I am now in a place where I have nearly ever single game I would ever want to own. Do I still want 3 more games? Yes. But I can now patiently wait for the reprints, because I have a completely sweet collection now. If anything, I need to thin out my collection."

59299,best perfume,"Apply a tiny amount of Vaseline on your throat and wrists and spray your perfume rather than rubbing your wrists, it will make the scent last long."
58654,best cologne,"I find it way too synthetic-sweet. I don’t mind, and sometimes even like, that stuff on others. But personally I can’t endure it the whole day on my own skin. Same with BdC"
12984,best gifts for mom,"Just as a plan B if your box isn't up to your ""gift to your mom"" quality and you want an alternative, check out etsy. Lots of really talented artists and tons of cool boxes for shrubberies. Just don't go there now and keep working on your box. Some artists on there make me feel like my attempts at creativity are trash. Hope your box turned out awesome!"

73630,best battery bank,Yeah it's just PD. The pixel needs it. Never had any issues with two pixels and PD. Can't speak to the others unfortunately!
61268,Best RPG game on PS4,Slightly misleading. You play through one ending. Chapter select the 2nd ending. And the 3rd is unlocked from doing the other 2. So one full playthrough and one 10min chapter select for 3 mandatory ending. Much easier than 3 playthrough.
10342,best suitcase lock,Put?  More like forcibly apply.
40986,best instrument to play,"Surprised nobody here has said euphonium (or baritone horn for those wondering, aka mini tuba).

Very forgiving, by far easiest brass instrument to sound good on and easy to produce sound because of the mouthpiece size."

Baie 19
Tuscan leather
Spice bazaar"
