Garfield played him at 18 or so. Thats a bit different than 15.
Huh...I will certainly try this next time. Thanks!
Yeah I’d put it in the Pizza Hut/ dominos category and say that it wins that fight. I’ll give it that.

"Alan Alda. I was at one of his book signings and I was so nervous to the point that all I could say was, “I love M* A* S* H!” And he took my hand for a second and made a joke about being surprised I knew about the show because I was young. Once I got past my absolute embarrassment, I realized he was so gracious and patient with me when he could have easily been a jerk. Great human being."

"Basically, this. Look at the places with the best ratings on TripAdvisor, and then read all of the negative reviews. If one review has a specific complaint, it can be ignored. But if the same thing keeps coming up, then you might have an issue."

"I purchased The Martian as a Kindle daily deal before there was even a mention of a movie. I sat on it and didn't read it.
When they announced the movie, I ended up reading it in one day."

I may be basic as fuck in saying this but Kinky Vodka is the tastiest Vodka I ever drank. (I really dont like the alcohol taste)
"Grew up with PlayStation... also got great memories with an Xbox 360, so I feel like I have a lot of love for both brands. 

Due to exclusives on the PS4 that are more to my taste, makes it my favorite over the one.  I could totally live with an Xbox if the exclusives start piling up!"
True detective is really good and if you haven’t you need to see breaking bad. Hannibal is true crime ish as well

"Honestly? Get a travel agent. In most cases, you don't pay them, they get a fee from various hotels and airlines that they recommend. Any place with a good reputation (Liberty's pretty decent, don't use AAA) will get you a great vacation. If anything goes wrong, instead of being stuck with whatever you booked online, you can call your agent and they'll fix it for you. You'll have a much better time if you get someone who's job it is to know these things to help you than if you try to get it done online. It surprisingly doesn't cost more than you would book for online, either."
[Binford's 1962 'Archaeology as Anthropology'](http://www.scribd.com/doc/30525496/Binford-1962-Archaeology-as-Anthropology) is one of the landmark articles for archaeology as a discipline.  I can name a bunch of other ones that are much more relevant to my specific research interests (Neutron Activation Analysis and Inka Administration in Coastal Peru) but this is the best archaeology article I can give you in terms of being broadly accessible and relavant.
"Yes, Beale Street in Memphis is great if you want a truly American cultural experience.  
You mentioned an appreciation of BBQ ribs.  There are several distinct styles in the US.  Do a bit of Googling, some are mustard based, some more vinegary, some more sweet, or hot.  They can be ""wet"", or ""dry"".  Someone else in the thread will know more, I'm sure.

I've been to every state except Alaska, and there's something great about every region.  Some of my favorites just off the top of my head are the Smithsonian, Mammoth Cave, Cedar Point Amusement Park, Yellowstone, the Rocky Mountains, and as you mentioned, Kentucky.  That region has beautiful scenery.  Chicago is often overlooked, but it is one of my favorite larger cities, as well as San Francisco.  

As for my specific advice, most tourists like the big cities, but I much prefer the trip itself.  I drive, and drive more.  See the US by driving.  Avoid the Interstates, or at least get off them and take the scenic route randomly.  This is the best way to see this country imo.  A week or two of driving and stopping wherever it looks interesting is my very favorite pastime."
