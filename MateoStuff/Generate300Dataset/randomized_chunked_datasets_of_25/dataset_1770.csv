33752,best electric car,Once the range improves on them and there is a wider variety of choices I'll probably get one. Right now they're a bit too expensive and limited range-wise for me to consider one in the near future.
65181,best phone service company,Verizon is the best. Actually works in the woods and mountains.
28598,best breakfast foods,College breakfast: wait until lunch
47505,best state to visit in the United States,"I was on a car trip from Anchorage, Alaska all the way to San Diego, California. It was awesome seeing all of the different climates and people on just the west coast. When you drive 500 or even 1500 miles and you are still inside of America, it really makes you appreciate its amazing, and beautiful scale."
52576,best hiphop album,A Piece Of Strange is amazing and imo miles ahead of Will Rap For Food.
15265,best tree for the garden,"My favorite willow in particular is the one at the Elms mansion in Rhode Island.

72991,best Linux distro,I've been using TW for about 2 years now and didnt have any major issues. And if something breaks for some reason you can always roll back pretty easily thanks to btrfs and snapper.
19463,best YouTube video,Just found this channel randomly when his D.B. Cooper video popped into my recommendations.
31516,best hotel to live in,"Completely agree on the Amans. 

Was in Amanfayun (Hangzhou) several years back and it was a very unique experience, especially contrasted against a crowded and noisy city. The experience of being in an oasis outside of time and space was so unique, and made all of the typical hotel amenities seem pedestrian."
66725,best soccer team in the world,Last 30 years*
14977,best romantic novel,"JR Ward is probably the only author where I don't want other plots.  I end up skipping entire chapters about the Lessers because I find it so boring.  The later Brotherhood books aren't as good as the first 6 and looking back aren't really worth reading beyond 6.  The Brotherhood Legacy books are okay, not great.  The most recent book, Blood Fury, I found myself way more invested and interested in the second romance involving Saxton than the recruits Peyton and Novo."
42347,movies like Inception,This conversation is *over*.
16677,best pet for toddlers,"Yep, she's fixed. She's just an adventurer, an outdoorsy cat."
17754,best Kardashian,".... wait say what, now?"
63213,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"May be a tweak conflict. Or a theme icon issue. Use iCleaner Pro to disable 50% of the Cydia Substrate Addons and try Zebra again. If ok, the cause is in one of the 50% you disabled, so work through until you find it.

If not, re-enable the 50% and turn off the other 50% - then follow above."
54527,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I have ac+ as well. It was the last pad I liked before taking the dive into artisans.

I'd say the hien is a good option for a touch more speed while still keeping control. Once you hit Raiden, you give up on the control more and forget any control on shidenkai. But if you're ready for crazy speed, feel free to try that tier ðŸ˜‰."
55353,best action and adventure novel series,No need to apologize! I'll definitely be checking some of these out.  Thanks!
71195,best movies with a cool twist,See this felt too predictable to me which makes me wonder if I've just watched too many of these movies lol
29501,best game console,"No, I've since played them. And the sudden change in mechanics and theme between the second and third games is certainly an understandable shock, especially while the fans were waiting and were promised a good, legitimate sequel for so many years.

But little old me, who picked it up without any of this hatred or pretense, decided that it was a good game by itself. In fact, I can probably guess at how the developers felt while developing it, ""This is so well polished, and such a nice departure from the usual shit! People will love it, and we can guarantee sales with this classic IP as well."" They may have lost track of the original idea through extended development, and underestimated the backlash they would receive, but It's a great game nonetheless, and I'm glad they published it as they did. Besides, collection platformers weren't in the popular spotlight at the time, and it wouldn't have done especially well anyway."
16528,best pet for toddlers,I wouldn't get a pet either.  What about taking her more places that have kids around or enrolling her in a play group or something like that?
64890,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Itâ€™s definitely the least-interesting burrito choice in Santa Barbara, a town which has many very good Mexican restaurants.

But, you know - sometimes you just want a bunch of chicken, rice, beans, and cheese as big as your head. And thatâ€™s why I go there sometimes."
61232,Best RPG game on PS4,"Great list! Since you recommended Bloodborne I will also recommend Dark Souls 3. It doesn't have the same great atmosphere as Bloodborne, but there's a lot more variety to weapons and builds. Compared to Bloodborne, the areas are a little tougher in DS 3, but I think the bosses are easier."
37502,best amusement park,"Definitely Six Flags America! Well, because it's close to me and actually it's a good park in spite of what you may have heard."
3307,best webcamera,"I got the c270, I bought it because it was so cheap. It's a great webcam for starting out."
44072,best items under $100,"Been watching all of these videos, theses kids are crazy, people are pulling guns on them and they don't even stand back."
