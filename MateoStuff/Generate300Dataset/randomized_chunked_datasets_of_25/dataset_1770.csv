31516,"Completely agree on the Amans. 

Was in Amanfayun (Hangzhou) several years back and it was a very unique experience, especially contrasted against a crowded and noisy city. The experience of being in an oasis outside of time and space was so unique, and made all of the typical hotel amenities seem pedestrian.",best hotel to live in

14977,"JR Ward is probably the only author where I don't want other plots.  I end up skipping entire chapters about the Lessers because I find it so boring.  The later Brotherhood books aren't as good as the first 6 and looking back aren't really worth reading beyond 6.  The Brotherhood Legacy books are okay, not great.  The most recent book, Blood Fury, I found myself way more invested and interested in the second romance involving Saxton than the recruits Peyton and Novo.",best romantic novel

I'd say the hien is a good option for a touch more speed while still keeping control. Once you hit Raiden, you give up on the control more and forget any control on shidenkai. But if you're ready for crazy speed, feel free to try that tier ðŸ˜‰.",best artisan mousepad alternatives

29501,"No, I've since played them. And the sudden change in mechanics and theme between the second and third games is certainly an understandable shock, especially while the fans were waiting and were promised a good, legitimate sequel for so many years.

But little old me, who picked it up without any of this hatred or pretense, decided that it was a good game by itself. In fact, I can probably guess at how the developers felt while developing it, ""This is so well polished, and such a nice departure from the usual shit! People will love it, and we can guarantee sales with this classic IP as well."" They may have lost track of the original idea through extended development, and underestimated the backlash they would receive, but It's a great game nonetheless, and I'm glad they published it as they did. Besides, collection platformers weren't in the popular spotlight at the time, and it wouldn't have done especially well anyway.",best game console
