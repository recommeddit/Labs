"Ronald Coase's ""The Problem of Social Cost"" is widely considered one of the most important social science papers ever written.  It deals with the economics topic of ""externalities.""  It has been massively cited in the social science literature and does not require advanced mathematical, legal or economics knowledge to understand (Coase was a lawyer turned economist).  

Interestingly, readers of ""The Problem of Social Cost"" seem to reach quite different conclusions about what what the paper means, with widely differing papers citing it in support of their conclusions.

Coase is considered to have earned his Nobel with this paper and his other classic ""The Nature of the Firm"" (about transactions costs). The papers are available on JSTOR and there are pdf copies around on the web (whose legal availability I cannot speak to)."
"You can ignore their suggestions you dislike while still using it to check the rest of your document for mistakes. It's not an ""all or nothing"" deal."

"I’ve been going through a few cases myself and have decided on Apple’s Silicon Case, Caseology’s Parallax, Bellroy’s Leather Case, and — my personal favorite going on 3x iPhone models now — Smartish’s Kung Fu Grip: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M21569G/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glc_fabc_Iy27FbZAW0D9K.

"I wouldn't say condoms **increase** your quality of life. They just prevent your quality of life from dropping.

edit: Condoms only prevent your quality of life from dropping *if* you are using them. You don't use condoms if you want to get pregnant - this doesn't apply to you."
