18668,best YouTube video,"Others have mentioned most of these in comments already, but my go-to music-related Youtube channels are [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/user/havic5), [Sideways](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw), [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch), [12 Tone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUtqcDkzw7bisadh6AOx5w), and [8-bit Music Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZLO2VgbZHeDcongKzzfOw). Getting a bit more niche, I enjoy most of [Samurai Guitarist's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/samuraiguit) and [Jens Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/user/jenslarsen02) does some neat Jazz music stuff. I was pretty big on [Music is Win](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshiNtfJ7Dj3nlh41a6M-kg), [Sean Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/user/seandaniel23), and [YourGuitarSage](https://www.youtube.com/user/yourguitarsage) in the past, but I haven't been keeping up with those three channels lately. Finally, [Dan Erlewine's videos for Stewart MacDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUUuMzxJ9h8) are amazing."

37741,best Marvel movie,I thought homecoming was a lot better than you did
20442,best workout music,"Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Van Halen"
47037,best hand santizer brand,"Good question!  Endospores are basically small, dormant, heavily protected copies of the bacteria that reside within the confines of the cell wall, alongside the bacteria itself.  Alcohol will absolutely kill the main bacterial cell but the endospore will often survive.  Under the right conditions the endospore can grow into another active bacterium.  

A common bug spread in hospitals, C.difficile, is known for having this mechanism.  That‚Äôs why hospital staff are told to specifically wash their hands after contact with patients suspected to have this; the alcohol won‚Äôt reliably kill the endospores."
19969,best workout music,I knew it was horseshit when I saw that Death From Above 1979 wasn't listed.

10672,best suitcase lock,"Been traveling internationally since the 70s. Visited about 25 countries. 15 of the years often with wife and kids. Not once anything stolen. Always followed three rules. First, never check anything worth stealing. Second, always ‚Äúlock‚Äùmy checked bag with twisty bag ties. I assumed a lock is no more secure than the tie, but the latter prevents accidental opening and is a signal there is nothing inside worth stealing. Third, carry anything valuable and keep it close.

Once or twice it looked like maybe somebody had opened a checked bag but nothing was missing."

11408,best gifts for dad,"You know what I want?  Mow the lawn without me having to remind you.  Do well in school.  Be motivated enough about your future that you *do* something other than waste your life on Reddit.  Damn it get passionate about something and master it.  Learn that accomplishment feels much better than something ""fun"".  Their success is best gift I can ever receive and that is not something that can be purchased to make *them* feel better that they got me some BS material possession.

Damn, you'd think my kids weren't doing well but, so far, I've gotten what I've wanted every year (minus the lawn mowing).

edit: some pronoun agreement stuff.  I was not passionate about grammar."
