What kind of work do you do?
"Brave Browser is a really solid browser that has built-in ad/tracker blocking, with an opt-in ad platform that pays you in crypto."
"Please dont start with PHP, you'll do yourself a favor. If you really wanna do web based stuff i'd advise JavaScript as in my opinion its easier than PHP, its more powerful and popular. PHP is very outdated and only alive cause of Wordpress.

&#x200B;

If you wanna do desktop apps or something of sorts i'd advise Pythion or C#. Java might be good as well but i havent had personal encounter yet. But out of Python and C# I personally enjoyed C# way more.  


Im kinda surprised PHP is higher than Javascript is haha, i'd wanna say PHP will be obsolete in 10 years but i know im wrong and that wont happen. Buy JavaScript will just get better and better as its getting new libraries,  updates and such sort of stuff quite often, like the release of things like TypeScript, Angular, React etc. etc. made JS much more powerful. You can pretty much do anything with JavaScript now days from front-end to back-end, windows apps, mobile apps and anything else.   


Fun fact: The discord app and Microsoft visual studio code are entirely built on JavaScript, and also if you actively use discord and learn JavaScript you could have fun by making your own discord bots, as those are made in JavaScript as well though im sure you can do that in python as well.  


Also about the 3rd place on your list: Its kinda invalid haha Html and CSS arent really programming languages, and PHP and JS are built around HTML so you must learn them anyways but just saying.  


TL;DRL: I'd suggest you start with either JavaScript for web or C# for apps."
"Nioh! Nioh 2 is all right, but the first one is absolutely amazing for combat mechanics. If the game seems too hard for you at first, level up magic. But please try to play through the game without using sloth talismans, it makes the bosses a LOT easier than the developers intended."
"I hope that they remake diamond and pearl too (and hopefully platinum as well), but I will always be reminiscent of the graphics from before generation 6."

"For employ-ability, engineering. Licensed engineers can work as engineers, public works professionals, consultants, computer tech, etc. Even if you don't work in a profession that requires a licensed engineer, a lot of the skills are transferable to other trades and people generally assume you are smart enough to learn a new job. If you are willing to move, it is hard to not find a job as an engineer.

However, I think business is the most useful. While it doesn't make you extremely employable, the skills you learn in management, accounting, and finance are used in almost every profession. You can be the best engineer, doctor, lawyer, architect, software developer, etc., but if you can run a business or make yours more profitable then you will not go far professionally."

"This is basically the only site I have found that is reliable. My only issue with audible is that once your account is gone, so are the books.  If OP wants to keep his/her audiobooks, you will have to convert them/save them to harddrive. 

If you cannot find it on audible, I would suggest going to theaudiobookbay. Its not legit, but its the only other place I know to get the rare audiobooks. 

Edit: If you are looking for classics, there are a lot of free audiobook sites with amateur readers. (As long as the copyright has expired)"
I use brown sugar and flax seed meal. Flax seed ads +1 health and a nutty taste which I like.
That's the power bank I use.l for my Android. I think it's ideal for regular USB phone as it has quick charge input and output. But OP has an iPhone X which uses USB-c so this won't work..
I've tried a couple of new providers last year and I particularly liked JustVps too. gave me 3 months plan with a 25% off too and I also saw they had promo codes for cloud but havent bothered to check their cloud yet
"I found this list a few months ago and started just going down it, checking out books from the library.  I was very proud that I had already read 7/10 of the top 10."
Either things have changed or portola is definitely not good
