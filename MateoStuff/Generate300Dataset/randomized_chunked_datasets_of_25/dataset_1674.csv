Additionally, you don't need to use antibacterial soap when washing your hands. Plain soap and warm water for 25 seconds is enough to remove most pathogens.

23804,"Depends what you're looking for, but there are loads of great games out there.  Some of the ones I have:


**iRacing/Assetto Corsa/rFactor 1/2**


These are the main games for realism - they go for as close to life as possible.  As such, they pretty much *need* a wheel; controllers just don't work well enough (though DiRT can get away with it).  Loads of setup options, real life cars/tracks etc... Don't look here for career modes though.  All but rFactor 1 have at least some laser-scanned tracks too.  


iRacing is the one for serious online play - join leagues and compete against other serious people .  Assetto and rFactor are the best for mods - literally thousands out there.  rFactor 2 is highly regarded as perhaps the most *realistic* (v. subjective tho) but afaik isn't being supported as much as it was.  Still incredible though.


If you want a specific car, rFactor 1 is still the way to go.  So many mods, and still great fun.  Nothing beats the DRM revival mod - still the benchmark for 70's/80's absurd cars.



Graphics (for me) Assetto > iracing > rFactor 2 > rFactor (but this is rarely important)

**Project Cars/F1 2015**


Both games go for realistic, but don't quite hit the mark.  F1 2015 is leagues ahead of the older f1 games in my opinion.  Loads of cars - decent career modes.  Good fun, but not so serious.  Pcars has absolutely loads of cars and tracks from various eras/competitions/parts of the world.  Graphics are gorgeous, and the career mode is comprehensive.  F1 2015 has the 2014 & 2015 seasons.


**DiRT 3/Next Car Game**


Both great arcade games.  DiRT 3 is the arcadey version of DiRT Rally - good fun but a bit annoying.  Next Car Game is still Early Access, but is the next thing in car destruction and is amazing entertainment.  Both good on controller also.


**Euro Truck 2/OMSI**


Both are Simulators instead of racing games, but are great fun if you like that kind of thing.  Euro Truck is literally running a haulage company and driving trucks around (not as easy as it sounds!).  Surprising amount of game there.  OMSI is a simulation of Buses being driven in Berlin in 1989 (iirc) and is strangely addictive...



**Grand Prix Legends/GT Legends/GTR 1+2**


Classic games that are still great.  If your pc isn't running newer stuff well, then these are fantastic.  Grand Prix Legends is ancient but still fun, all about F1 from the 1960's.  Gt Legends is cars from the 60's up to the 80's(?) - GTR 1+2 are made by the same company and were groundbreaking in their day - 00's touring cars.



With regards to a wheel, I personally would lean towards the Logitech G27 instead of the newer one - you get a gearstick included with the G27 out of the box, plus it's cheaper too.  It's not the quietest though - the helical gears can be very noisy compared to belt-driven wheels, but the G920 has the same so I doubt it's make too much difference here.  If you want something more expensive then I'd recommend either Fanatec or Thrustmaster.",best car racing video game

68944,"Only other work I've read by her is Broken Earth -- like another commenter says, this has a lighter attitude.

TCWB felt (to me) very lyrical. I found the prose style to be descriptive, emotionally evocative and insightful. She handles dialogue a bit more like Scalzi (fast-paced, a bit witty, but still with a brisk sense of sharpness fitting to a story about NYC).

The characters didn't just feel real, they felt lived in (when they needed to). 

BUT! There is social commentary (I mean, it's a science fiction book and social commentary is the whole purpose of the genre) and some find that to be not what they are looking for. Lots of thought about gentrification, lots of thought about identity and what it means to be your authentic self (with some of the layers that come with that for folks in different identities).",best science fiction novel
