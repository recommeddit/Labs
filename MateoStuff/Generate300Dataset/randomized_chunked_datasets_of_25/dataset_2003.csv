21964,best celebrity,"Jason Momoa. He’s an absolute treasure to be around. He’s genuine and loves his job. He wants his fans to have as much fun as he’s having. He can size up a fan and know how far to push/tease them to make them comfortable while not going too far. His personality is infectious, and I had a blast with him."

13170,best gifts for mom,"My husband got me an iPad for a combo Mother's Day/ birthday present when our daughter was a month old. If the iPad Mini had been available then, that would have actually have been better! It was a great gift. I loved reading on the Kindle app while I was nursing. Now that my daughter is 2.5, she actually uses it and it helps when I need to distract her and get something done. 

Even better than a cleaning service gift certificate is to actually book it. Sometimes it's the little things - like making a phone call to schedule a time to clean that can feel like a huge hurdle to get past in those early days of motherhood."
