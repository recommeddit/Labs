"Too damn expensive, and nowhere to recharge them where I live.


Personal issues: they are boring. Add a fake clutch pedal and a fake manual stick, add limiters to the electrical engine to make it behave depending on how I'm operating the stick and clutch (to mirror actual manual car driving behaviour), and make it make artifical engine sounds in speakers depending on the clutch and stick. And I'm in lol. Driving a stick is like 50% of the fun from car driving for me, I'm addicted to shifting.

And they're too complicated, I like my cars as simple as possible. Engine, AC, oldschool gauges, and go. Don't need any fancy AWD or infotaintment systems/reverse cameras."
Why is usmobile listed as not having wifi calling?  They even have a page for how to use it: https://www.usmobile.com/blog/what-is-wifi-calling/
BeamNg.Drive is pretty fun.

"I came to this thread to warn people about it too. Guys, it's not for everyone. It's A BUTTLOAD of work. You think you know how much is too much work? You don't know shit. In other jobs, work ends when you finish your work. In game dev, there is no finish lines. If you are good at your job and you complete your work fast, your reward is more work. There is always more work. The industry burns young minds like no other, so be very, VERY sure before going in. 

Edit: jeez ok people, I know there are other jobs with high hour demand, no need to keep pointing it out and getting all pissy about it. But a guy who goes into game dev isn't going in with the same mentality as someone who goes into science or medicine. Also most people already know science and medicine are a lot of work, and this is a warning thread, we're supposed to be telling them what they don't know."
"I have an [Urban Armor Gear case.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/URBAN-ARMOR-iPhone-Display-White/dp/B00LCAVWBI/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1423942095&sr=1-7&keywords=urban+armor+gear+iphone+6) It doesn't add a lot of bulk, its pretty damn solid but the only real problems I have with it are:  
  
1. It has these two holes in the back which I do think let some dust in between the case and the phone. And...  
2. I actually have no idea how to get the phone out of the case without breaking a nail (I feel like I'll bend my phone if I try too hard), it snapped in so damn tight and I haven't even tried taking it out in fear of bending my iPhone.  
All in all though, definitely prevents your screen from flat out hitting the ground if you drop it and it has nice protection around the corners in case you do drop it."
Red Dead Redemption still not on PC... (cries in pillow)
I'll second that!
"Kings Dominion for amazing coasters and good atmosphere. Busch Gardens Williamsburg for amazing atmosphere and good coasters.
I wouldn't recommend anything else. Except maybe Hersheypark."
What are the pros/cons of each?
depends. Lowes has higher quality lumber or perhaps fewer folks picking through it. HD has lower prices and more knowledgeable [if less attractive] folks working there
Her airbending is excellent

"For best budget right now, 8 Plus. Had it for a year before upgrading and had amazing battery and the screen is great... I at times thought it looked better then a friends Samsung OLED panel. Cameras are decent too even if you aren’t looking for that"

"There's a few schools of thought, his publication order and chronological order are totally different. _Legend_ was his first book, and is a decent starting point. HOWEVER that is more of a defence than an adventure, though it is very good. Maybe _Morningstar_ or _Waylander_ might be more in-theme.  

My favorite is _Knights of Dark Renown_, which just happens to be the first book chronologically in that world. However it's really quite odd, though it is an adventure... I suppose."
