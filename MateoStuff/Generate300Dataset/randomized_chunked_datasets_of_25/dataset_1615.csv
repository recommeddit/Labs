2129,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Sssssh don’t tell people about this gem, their Thai chicken pizza gives me life"
26601,best board games,"Disagree. While isle of sky may be the better game for gamers, you can teach literally anyone Carcassonne and keep their attention (especially if you take out farmers for the first game.) It's the perfect way to get hesitant people into games and is really good to have around because of that."
61889,Best RPG game on PS4,I just got into skyrim and I can't decide if I like it or not tbh. It's fun but to me it seems sort of grindy in the way that the quests are similar. Maybe I'm just new idk. There's a lot of fun too it though as well! I'm just saying I heard so many great things about skyrim it seems almost underwhelming now that I have it. I'll continue to play it and see if it gets more fun!

34344,best NFL player,"Yeah, other than Cmp% the most reliable thing year to year is PFF grade, you can argue there's some autocorrelation going on in QBs they just like, but I do think it says something about subjective views of QB play being very valuable."
