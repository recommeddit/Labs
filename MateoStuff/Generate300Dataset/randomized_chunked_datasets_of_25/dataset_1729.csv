33792,best electric car,"We're on our third one, so I guess we like them. I've sold two of our four ICE cars and I'm almost to the point of selling the other two. It's been nice having the MR2 for sporty driving, and the Highlander for road trips because they filled niches the Leaf and Bolt couldn't. Maybe I'll keep the Highlander for hauling messy shit, IDK. The Tesla was expensive but it's the first EV where I don't feel like we've had to make any more compromises. I feel like I'm almost at that point I was where I saw the LCD and plasma TV's coming and I yard-saled all our CRT televisions for decent money before you couldn't give them away.

I don't miss the ICE sounds. I don't miss the maintenance. I don't miss transmissions and laggy acceleration. I don't miss standing around freezing my ass off in the cold at gas pumps in the winter. I don't miss 20% daily price fluctuations in my fuel costs. I don't miss the part where the wife insists we sit in a line of cars at the fuel pumps at Costco for 20 minutes so we can save $0.10 a gallon. I don't miss those fucking TV's they have on gas pumps at so many places nowadays screaming ads you can't turn off no matter how many buttons you push. Really the whole paradigm.

I still have to tolerate all that shit with my company car, but when it comes to weekend driving we've pretty much exclusively used the EV's for years now.

I'd probably buy one of those Honda Urban EV's like OP."

790,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"I wonder who was the first person to put what outwardly seems like an odd combination of flavors together and yet the result somehow fits so perfectly. 

If not man, than surely it must have been Prometheus stealing the recipe from the Gods."
63832,best books for building better habits reddit,Not sure if it applies to you but Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking is probably the most effective quit smoking book ever made.  He even applied the same method to later books on losing weight and cutting alcohol.  Good Luck mate!
73232,best Linux distro,"I wouId say **1st Mint**, 2nd Debian, 3rd Ubuntu.

I used the three of them during my undergrad, and I would say that **Linux Mint** is a no nonsense version of Ubuntu, meaning that is quite beginner friendly but keeps a more conservative approach to package managing.
Further, the Cinnamon desktop is one of my favourites, also a no nonsense DE in my opinion.
**Debian** is great, but ugly out of the box with any DE, so you have to be up for some *ricing*, and although once installed it just works I remember running into some minor problems the first time I installed it.
**Ubuntu** is fine, my main concern is that they push *Snap* on you but you still need *apt* for lots of things. Not that I am against *Snap*, I only say that in order to have your system updated correctly you should use only one package manager or to be very mindful about how you install things.

At the end Debian is mom and she knows what to do, Ubuntu the older child that a lot of people like but is kind of a weirdo, and Mint is the favourite child that is an angel and everyone love.

Edit: Comas phrasing and *I use Arch btw*."
