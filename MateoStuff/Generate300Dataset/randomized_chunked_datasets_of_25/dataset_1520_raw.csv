Glossy was the word i was looking for! thank you.
You need to park in the White Zone for that.  The Red Zone is for loading and unloading only.
"Usually just shell, but sometime also lf. lf is similar to ranger but faster, lighter, and configurable with shell: https://github.com/gokcehan/lf"
"Oh, was I supposed to prepare a picnic lunch and sing a little song?  I didn't think I was 'unfriendly' or 'unhelpful' the first time.  

Americans, can't speak for Germans, fuck up apostrophes CONSTANTLY these days.  Almost everyone under 30 puts an apostrophe on a plural s, where there should be none.  It is a stupid basic mistake that contributes to making us look like a country of idiots.  As an English teacher, rather than killing them, I simply point it out.

So maybe you should avoid butting in (or in German, being a Besserwisser) in a situation that doesn't involve you (or Germans).  You are not the OP."
"I mean, if you're just visiting it should be okay, it's not horrible everywhere, but I wouldn't recommend anyone who lives here switch over.  It is pretty congested for sure, depending on where you are."
"Pretty sure it voids the warranty as well, just like when people use their Volts as a gas generator"
Do you consider UMUC a good school?
"Always loved Taylor's face when Zaius had Cornellius read the scroll out on the beach. He doesn't even try to argue.

For all Taylor's antagonism towards Zaius, he has pretty much the same opinion of man. The whole reason he was on the mission in the first place was because he'd become disillusioned with humanity. He expresses the sames views as Zaius does at the beginning of the film."
Knuckleball. Not a sports fan but found this thoroughly interesting.
"A tent. Go get out there, enjoy nature"
"I would also like to add that, if you are a JRPG fan, the PS3 is key for that genre."
"I just could not get into King of Dragon pass. What am I doing wrong? 

I just could not get a feel for the consequences of actions or a sense of building anything so it all felt aimless to me."
"That Final Destination 5 kill count was the greatest thing.

Guitar is tricky with the mixed tuning. But you could absolutely make an argument that scales and intervals are easier to learn on bass (which is all 4ths) than piano.
droppin plates is like the ultimate lifting song and not just because it has a badass name
"No real surprise, the CSU system has always been looked down upon because they're not ""prestigious"" , likely because they're not research schools. Cal poly is leagues ahead of all the other CSUs (and many of the UCs IMO) at teaching actually usable skills and getting people into well paying jobs, but it still isn't well known outside of California.

LOTR is more of a long walk than an adventure
"I drink one low carb monster or zero carb rockstar every morning. I drink one because I really don't like coffee. Also, I exercise and sleep enough but the caffeine is supposed to be good for my liver, since I drink too much alcohol."
I like how it shows the week in 2 columns. Think aCal does it too. Thanks for the suggestion.
"Do you ever stay at a hotel while staying at a hotel, xzibit style? (i.e. staying in hotel in town X but have to make a couple day trip to town Y a few towns over and get a hotel there too)"
"Whoa, ordering one now. My husband has insanely thick, wavy hair and he gets so frustrated with it. This might buy me a few more years of a long-haired husband before he gets fed up and shaves it all off."
"Another one for piano here. Imo it is laid out the most logically and is the easiest way to really dig in to the theory part of things. Once you get some of the basics you can always use your piano knowledge as a reference to learn other instruments.

I've seen very good multi instrumentalists go back to the piano time and again to work out melodies, rhythms, etc. and apply that knowledge to all sorts of different instruments. 

Once you start getting a grasp of some of the basic patterns it is a magical thing and really fun. Music is the language of the universe. Start today and you will be surprised how quickly you can pick it up. Have fun and good luck!"

"i read my local weekly.  not cover to cover, but it's always got something worth reading in there.  mostly just reports of local wildlife and athletes, but still not something i'm going to find online."
