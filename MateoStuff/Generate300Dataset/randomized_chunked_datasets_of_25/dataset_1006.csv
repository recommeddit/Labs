22325,best celebrity,Samuel L. Jackson at the Calgary stampede in Canada. He was super nice. My family went up for it because my uncle is part of the committee that organizes the stampede every year and he got us VIP seating. I was a kid at the time and I was like does your wallet really say OBAMF? He laughed and said he left that one at home. Of course when I told the story at school I told everyone his wallet did in fact say that.

6343,best Netflix documentary,"- Don’t F!ck with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer (I couldn’t even watch this at times bc the videos were SO upsetting, so I legit would cover my eyes like a child. But everything else? Super intriguing!)
- Evil Genius: History’s most diabolical bank heist
- American murder- Family next door (on Chris and Shannan Watts, and their children. Just...yikes. Pretty horrific)
- Going Clear- A study of the church of Scientology (THIS is HBO, but I rly wanted to include it bc it dives so deeply into the toxic world of Scientology, and the effect it has in its members. Truly powerful)

Still finishing The Cecil Hotel rn, I’ll let u know lol. Everything else- SO good! EDIT- I forgot to include “Fyre” however there’s like 5 of these man so idk which one I actually watched but- dude has issues and he’s still robbing ppl to this day. Pretty fked, sparked a lively debate in my household anyway."

Are you looking for something that protects it from drops too? Or just something for very basic protection like on a table or in a bag etc?"

5021,best home improvement store,"If you're buying things like actual hardware, HD has a much better selection, particularly metric. It's nowhere near as good as Ace/True Value type hardware stores of course, but it's certainly better stocked than Lowe's is in that regard."
4812,best home improvement store,I've found that Lowes staff know a lot less than Home Depot. When I say know less I mean something as general as knowing where something in the store is. Pricing there the same. Products Like Home Depot better. I used to prefer Lowes simple because it's closer to my house. Now I drive a bit further because I'd rather buy from Home Depot.
