"Definitely Gino’s. Big floppy slices and perfectly chewy dough. Simple and delicious. 

Woodstock’s tastes like marinara sauce and breadsticks. You can ask for “thin crust” but it just means they don’t fold the crust over to make that disgusting sauce pocket. I actually think their gluten free crust is decent - it’s more like a thin crust pizza.  But overall Woodstock’s would be my last choice other than Pizza Hut."
"Whatever you choose avoid PCmobile.at all costs (PCmobiletalktous@loblaw.ca). They are the worst. Terrible service. Terrible customer service. They double bill, suspend service for unknown reasons and you'll spend hours on the phone trying to fight for what you paid for. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid"
"That is why I love it so much. I think Mark Twain had it right: ""If you've got something good to say, it shouldn't take you very long to say it"""
"While probably not as mind-blowing as most of the films listed here, this plot twist is still one of my favourites.

So from which cultural interpretations and influences on color does this guide draw?
"Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice, or lightning..."
Dear Zachary.... will break your soul. Wonderfully told
"*Mistborn*, Brandon Sanderson

*Codex Alera*, Jim Butcher

*Memory, Sorrow and Thorn*, Tad Williams

I really, *really* enjoyed all of these. (Which is not the same as saying they're good, as I'm very much aware.) They all feature their own big fantasy world to explore and lose yourself in, suitably epic stories and stakes and an enjoyable (and sizeable!) cast of characters to follow along and come to care about. I'd rank them as firmly high fantasy, like Lord of the Rings."
for general use firefox is best because it is very private and doesnt use chromium

"my asshole friend told me, as a spoiler, that Coca Cola takes over the world...the whole time until the last minute I kept looking for a bottle (or can) to show up, not the brand mascot. he also told me the blonde is a ghost in 6 sense, thought the kid was dead until the end"
"We also have a really horrible case of tall poppy syndrome and poorly handled foreign relationships.

Oh, tall poppy syndrome means cutting people down to size whenever they seem to be getting ahead."
I TOOK IT . . .
"If you like Wendover, you will love [Polymatter](https://youtube.com/polymatter)! Similar videos but more focused on topics like strange economics or why something isn't how it seems (eg his video on why Bing ISNT a failure)."
I liked Parasite as well! It def had those unexpected moments in it.
"If A Tree Falls- An interesting look at the Earth Liberation Front and an examination of what constitutes terrorism.

The Big Fix- A look at the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon explosion."
"I'm glad you enjoyed FT - it doesn't seem like it would be a great one on paper, but it's just a damn fun coaster!"

">replayability

It's one of it's flaws actually, there isn't really any big replayability factor you can obviously pick different cars and upgrade them differently but there isn't much to it since it's very linear, it also has a weak endgame


>multiplayer

It's there for the people that like it, i really couldn't tell you much about it sorry because i never played NFS for the multiplayer."
I am actually going to the store to get some. Fuck this...
