"Carbon filters will take out the chlorine in the water, they may also have some multimedia (sand, gravel, etc) in there as well to catch some of the suspended solids in the water as well.

What the filters won't do is 1.) Soften the water (removal of calcium and magnesium) 2.) Filter out TDS (Total Dissolved Solids- minerals, chemicals, etc) or 3.) Deionization/add resisitivity."

Currently using a Shakespeare collected edition and The Wise Man's Fear :p
"Another vote for pc38x, I've had them since they came out. I think they're super comfortable, personally I like open ear headphones for gaming because I still like to hear what's going on around me while I play games."
"whenever I hear someone say ""go fuck yourself"" I always think of Predestination"
"If Jerry, Terrell and Marvin were erased from history yeah maybe"
No tears for Yueh.
"It's absolutely a tour de force. A first contact story, a space opera, a mystery story, a thriller; it is so tightly plotted most SF screenwriters should commit *seppuku* in front of a copy. I'm a little unenthusiastic about the romance thread, but it doesn't detract from the main story.

I would so watch a movie made of the book (always provided, of course, that they keep Ridley Scott away from it) and that would now be possible, as was demonstrated by *District 9*.

It would just wipe the floor with utter bullshit like *Avatar*."
gedit because what more could you need other than a notepad with syntax highlighting and tabs?
"I thought I read somewhere that they put gin in tonic water to make the tonic taste better. 

Edit: [if Wikipedia says it, it has to be true](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_tonic)"
"A natty ice has 157 calories. 4-5 of those isn't going to help you cut at all. That's 600-750+ calories, which is the same as 2-3 bombers of something really good. If you have good taste in beer, why do you do that to yourself?"

Yeah I went with a VA monitor just for that 3000:1 contrast ratio and it's worth it to me.

"So using hydrogen peroxide on my bathroom fixtures instead of, or after bleach would kill more germs? Or is bleach good enough, even though the peroxide is technically stronger, the bleach is killing everything anyways?"
Residential architect here. We use this site often in my office when selecting finishes. Site is super easy to navigate. Saves alot of time.
"It was a hostel in India. It is called Dreams Hostel in Goa India, check it out if you're in that area! The owner is amazing and I made so many friends in that place."

I was also going to suggest Happy Face. So good. It's a nice change of pace from all the other ones listed (although the other ones are really good too)!
I had more luck getting Double Commander to be like TotalCommander. But I also had a very customized tcmd setup so my needs may be different than yours.
"I used to get a copy of my audiobooks here [Think and Grow Rich Audiobook](https://www.wiaudiobooks.com/product/think-and-grow-rich-audiobook/) , this may not be about what you are looking for but this may be a good source for you where you can start."
