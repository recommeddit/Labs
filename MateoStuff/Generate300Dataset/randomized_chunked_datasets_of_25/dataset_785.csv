22591,best celebrity,"Ugh, I remember a story on here a few months ago about him. The person's friend, this small asian woman, was a huge fan of his. She saw him in Vegas taking pictures with all of these hot women and walked up to ask for an autograph. Completely ignoring her is dickish enough, but on top of that he put his hand on her face, pushed her out of his way and walked off."
12461,best gifts for mom,"It was a gift I gave her almost as an afterthought. A small candid Polaroid picture of myself laughing at some dumb joke on set. I had it framed and tossed it into her stocking. Out of all of her presents that year, she loves that one the most. She keeps it on her desk to remind her that even though she worries about me being so far away, I'm doing what I love and having a great time doing it."

40934,best instrument to play,"I can go on and on about this lol ill try and real it in.  Tabs show you how, but not why.  They enable you to learn songs without knowing things like what notes you're playing, what key you are in, or possibly without even understanding what I mean by ""key"".  

Over time, your guitar playing skills out-develop your overall understanding of what's going on, which is fine its not like this is some sort of established rule.  But if you're looking to take the next step particularly in a theory direction, then you need to start looking at tabs as cheating.  Sometimes you gotta cheat, dont get me wrong, but you get the idea.    

Now I'm no demon studio guitarist over here, but I can hold my own improvise-wise and I like to come up with my own progressions and riffs.  When I do that sort of stuff I'm thinking about things like rhythm, scales, key, what I just played, what I'm about to play... EVERYTHING, but certainly not the fret numbers.  

If you're looking for suggestions, id say wrap your head around what a key is.  If you enjoy sight reading, run with that, but I do not.  What helped me was I took one key signature: G major.  That's my key.  Learn that key.  learn the notes, learn where they are on the guitar, and then learn what chords go with those notes.  Id be happy to talk you through that, but only if you are interested."
