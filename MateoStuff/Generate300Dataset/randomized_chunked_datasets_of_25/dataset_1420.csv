30463,best Mexican war to study,"I imagine part of it is the fact that the war is can be a bit confusing. Keeping track of all the differing participants and, in some cases, what side they happened to be fighting for isn't easy. On top of that, there were so many motives for fighting. One has to accept that this wasn't just a religious war or a spat between empires, a power-grab &c. I found, when reading about the war, that I needed to read as if the book were a novel - keeping track of multiple plots and characters - rather than just a retelling of the facts. 

That being said, I do find the war an interesting one, precisely because of its esoteric nature - though not the most interesting, for me that would probably be WWI, largely because of the literature during and after the war by those actually fighting, I'm a sucker for knowing about how people experienced wars."

You don't need an account (unless you want to create one). All torrents listed there have their torrent hash displayed. Treat torrent hashes like magnet links & copy/paste the hash into your torrent client to download the torrent."

33972,best Pokemon game,"Anything from Gen 5 and Gen 6 are both good starting points due to their polish and just abundance of content (in Gen 6 thatâ€™s mainly in regards to ORAS). My personal pick for a newcomer would be X and Y, even though I much prefer Black and White"

26971,best board games,"Quick thought experiment: What if instead, you ranked the worst game 1, and best game 96,409?

The difference for TM would then be 1.00013 times.

That's why when doing percentiles, you don't use multiplication, you use standard deviation."
41827,movies like Inception,"I'd add ""Arrival"" to the list as well. Language - nonlinear orthography as a means to understanding time as nonlinear and being able to see into the future."
55866,best action and adventure movie,"should've mentioned *National Treasure 2*. that came out twelve years ago

18035,best Kardashian,Do we know for sure it was Bella Thorne?
23087,best celebrity,"I've heard Ian can be nice or not nice. I have witnessed, in person, him go from very nice to impatient when people are mucking about or delaying him.

It's worth remembering he is an elderly man, so his reserves of patience may be a little thin. Also he is not at all like his public persona - he is not proper and gentlemanly, he is like either an excitable teenage boy or a grumpy old man.

Side story: he has quite the conveyer belt of young males companions while filming LOTR here in NZ (not dodgy young). His favourite he ended up flying all over the world for a few years.

Also, Elijah pissed in a fountain and Orlando walked down the street, drunk, yelling ""I'm about to be famous, who wants to suck my dick!"""
36997,best roller coaster at six flags,"I have a tough time ranking X2, Full Throttle, and Tatsu.  All three are awesome in different ways.   Twisted Colossus is on another level, however."
3174,best webcamera,"I use the Logitech C920. It's pretty pricey but widescreen, hd, 15 megapixels, and a glass lense. I love it."
13069,best gifts for mom,"More like ""nothing says happy holidays like 'here's something to clean your house with.'"""
25173,best spiderman actor,"When I was a younger  Spider-Man was my favorite. Spider-Man 2 the game is still the best spidey game because of the swinging mechanics, open world, etc. 

As Iâ€™ve grown Iâ€™ve moved on from him. When youâ€™re young heâ€™s an awesome guy to follow. When you mature heâ€™s still exciting but the connection passes and now I find other characters interesting because I can relate better.

Heâ€™ll always be my nostalgic #1 though. And thank god for just cause 3 because those grappling hooks remind me of spidey back in the day."
32095,best hotel to live in,The Haymarket Hotel in London. Just gorgeous.
25009,best spiderman actor,"The main problem with the Toby movies was that Spider-Man never actually produced webbing from his body (along with other jumps in the lore). At least now the story is accurate with the webbing coming from the wrist attachments that Peter Park made himself, etc."
