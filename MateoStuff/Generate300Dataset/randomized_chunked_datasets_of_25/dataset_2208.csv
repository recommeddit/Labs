38725,best newspapers to read,"Daily mail is specifically targeted toward over 50s and the only paper to be angled towards a women demographic. Hence xenophobia and very bitchy articles about other women.   I would say the Independent supposed to be the most neutrally respected paper, surprisingly the free newspaper the Metro is free of any political leanings due to its advertising base. Have to disagree with the Guardian as being free of bias, that newspaper is to the left to what the tabloids are for the right, written for teachers and retired public servants."

20774,best workout music,Malaguena by Stan Kenton
68142,best science fiction novel,"I love the book because he's putting the new society on Earth, where I could believe it a little more.  In fact, in parts it reads more like an adventure from a strange land than science fiction.  But I do believe Antarctica came after the Mars Trilogy.

One other overreaching theme I first noticed in this book was his ideal woman type - tall, strong, athletic, independent in actions.  I've seen those also in his later books (don't know yet whether Freya in Aurora falls into this category; I'm only about a third through the book), but KSR was on top of his game in writing about such a woman.  In Science in the Capital (individual books; didn't read the shorter collection) he was just swooning over softball players, without much subtlety."
