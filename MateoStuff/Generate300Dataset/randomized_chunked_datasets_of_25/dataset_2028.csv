Additional films that would fit here are ""The Princess Bride"" (1987); ""Spartacus"" (1960); and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). All three of these have plenty of action and adventure.",best action and adventure movie

68162,"In no particular order, I sort of like them all the same:

* **The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers = The world\-building is incredible and I just really like the way the unique and wonderful characters on board the ship all work so well together to keep the ship running \(kind of like 'FTL: Faster Than Light' in novel form, that's the best way I can describe it\).
* **Neuromance**r by William Gibson = The imagery is right up my ally, the cyberpunk noir genre is amazing and this is simply one of the best books I've ever read.
* **Forever War** by Joe Haldeman = I don't even remember much about the actual storyline of this book other than that I enjoyed every page, and the Starship Troopers\-esque battle scenes are brilliant. Very fine military sci\-fi.
* **Ninefox Gambit** by Yoon Ha Lee = Just insanely good. I love the harsh, military world and the epic space battles have some the best imagery I've ever read. Might not be something people agree with but I find it reminiscent of Warhammer 40K, at least what I've experienced of that universe.
* **Dune** by Frank Herbert = It's just a classic, really, and while I didn't enjoy it in the same way as some others, it stands the test of time and is a really enjoyable read despite its length. The dialogue really is incredible, and the book is honestly entirely driven by the fantastic characterisation in my opinion.",best science fiction novel
