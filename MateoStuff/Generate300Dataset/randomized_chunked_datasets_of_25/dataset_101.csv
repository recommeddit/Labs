36682,best alcoholic drink,"My favourites are cherry vodka and lemonade, passion fruit gin and lemonade and pink/raspberry gin and lemonade. It’s all about experimenting. I love trying new cocktails and don’t always like them, but it’s just about finding out what you like and don’t like. I can’t drink whiskey/bourbon alone or with mixers, but I love them in certain cocktails if the balance is right."

35196,best alcoholic drink,"Shitty bottom shelf vodka with lemonade

One time I actually got nice vodka and mixed it, but I felt myself missing the shitty acetone taste"
4906,best home improvement store,"Actually yes. You see my significant other is unreasonable when it comes to home improvement stores. We debate on this topic at great length, but alas we have not yet come to agreement. It might end up being a deal breaker for sure. How do you resolve these issues?"
68338,best science fiction novel,It was alright.
4650,best text editor,"Well, keybindings?"
7558,best laptop for general use,"Hi, what is your budget? Does battery life or weight matter to you?"
38630,best newspapers to read,I don't buy it every day but when I do I read it cover-to-cover. Agree with your point that most people don't need to know the ins and outs of everything they cover; however I do find their comment section especially a cut above other newspapers
44498,best items under $100,"As someone who has tried that... they are _absolutely_ good as mini-pizzas, and I absolutely recommend you try it."
60229,best freezer brand,Alas no wood stove for me.  Thanks for the tip though!
31027,best country to live in,"Spain is FIRE friendly.  Your biggest issue is going to be the immigration/VISA issue. Find a list of countries where you can be an expat and then ask your question about those countries. For example, New Zealand is great, but you either need to be a citizen, have a specific skill and want to work, or have many millions to buy your way in."
31077,best country to live in,I thought about it too
19032,best YouTube video,"I would add Numberphile and Objectivity to these lists, especially since you have Stand-up Maths (Matt Parker is a regular on Numberphile)."
9250,best toothpaste,Crest Gum Detoxify has been my go-to lately
73276,best Linux distro,"No problem! We are always here to help. As for the app difference, not all distros share the same code. That's why some apps that are on Arch Linux, won't work on debian, it is a different format. Most windows apps you'll find alternatives to. For example: Microsoft to do, you have planner for that. Windows Store, most distros have their own custom Store(though it always is recommended that you use the terminal to install stuff since that way you'll get used to using it).

&#x200B;

Edit: As you are looking at three options which are all Debian based, you'll basically find every app you need. Debian is the most popular ""dad"" of distros, so that's why almost all stuff is packaged for it by default."
53891,best medicine for a cold,"i work for a doctor who also told me it was allergies.. but i have this happen a few times during the winter and it goes away in a few days, and i developed the symptoms for this while i was in london so i really don't think it's allergies. however i'm not going to argue with a doctor and am going to go try allergy medicine."

60234,best freezer brand,"Cool story: I was working security for a big estate auction back last fall. Auction started at lunch but wasn't over until almost 1am. Not many people left at that point and they were wrapping up and alot of stuff was getting passed over because no one was bidding. The auctioneer wouldn't take any less than a $5.00 bid. Well this midsize chest freezer came up. She wasn't the prettiest girl at the ball with her slightly rusty top and a couple rust spots on side but she worked. NO ONE BID! They passed it over and moved on. I went straight to the office and got a bidder number and after fees I paid $6.15 for a chest freezer that has been working since last fall and has a TON of meat chillin' out inside.

EPIC WIN!"

64088,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"That is actually a good enough answer. For audiobooks ABB and Mobilism are the best, if its not too obscure chances are you find them here. They are really really good"
73494,best battery bank,"Hmm, interesting - looks like just about 50% more weight for 50% more capacity, plus bonus charging port.

I sort of assumed of jumping to a 20,000 size... but might have to think about this! :)"
56705,best desktop monitor,Personally I have never noticed that my desk doesnt move at all. OP if you have a desk that moves a lot make sure you are okay with this problem.
