36682,"My favourites are cherry vodka and lemonade, passion fruit gin and lemonade and pink/raspberry gin and lemonade. It’s all about experimenting. I love trying new cocktails and don’t always like them, but it’s just about finding out what you like and don’t like. I can’t drink whiskey/bourbon alone or with mixers, but I love them in certain cocktails if the balance is right.",best alcoholic drink

For example, New Zealand is great, but you either need to be a citizen, have a specific skill and want to work, or have many millions to buy your way in.",best country to live in

73276,"No problem! We are always here to help. As for the app difference, not all distros share the same code. That's why some apps that are on Arch Linux, won't work on debian, it is a different format. Most windows apps you'll find alternatives to. For example: Microsoft to do, you have planner for that. Windows Store, most distros have their own custom Store(though it always is recommended that you use the terminal to install stuff since that way you'll get used to using it).

Edit: As you are looking at three options which are all Debian based, you'll basically find every app you need. Debian is the most popular ""dad"" of distros, so that's why almost all stuff is packaged for it by default.",best Linux distro

60234,"Cool story: I was working security for a big estate auction back last fall. Auction started at lunch but wasn't over until almost 1am. Not many people left at that point and they were wrapping up and alot of stuff was getting passed over because no one was bidding. The auctioneer wouldn't take any less than a $5.00 bid. Well this midsize chest freezer came up. She wasn't the prettiest girl at the ball with her slightly rusty top and a couple rust spots on side but she worked. NO ONE BID! They passed it over and moved on. I went straight to the office and got a bidder number and after fees I paid $6.15 for a chest freezer that has been working since last fall and has a TON of meat chillin' out inside.

EPIC WIN!",best freezer brand
