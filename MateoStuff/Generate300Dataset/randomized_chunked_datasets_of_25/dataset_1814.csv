2. Aventus (120ml bottle days, not anymore)

3. Noir de Noir (this is what a deep & intense perfume should smell like)

4. Soleil Blanc (this is what light & easy to wear perfume should smell like)

26811,best board games,"I played through 90 or so scenarios with my wife. It was a hoot! Dungeon delving, new scenarios, skin of your teeth wins and losses, what’s not to love?

I would never try to play it with 3 other non family members. I could never trust that kind of commitment."
4140,best online college,"Yeah, he’s an idiot. I have a college degree from prior to the Army from a state school. I’m applying to green to gold to earn my masters and commission because I’m sick of Intel. 

The board of Officers that select Soldiers for this program put in their AAR last year, “brick and mortar schools held more weight than those who went to online schools.” So it isn’t just a check the box like some people say. You will be judged, ESPECIALLY in the civilian world."
65499,best phone service company,"Ain't that the truth. But when I showed up was when SoftBank, and only SoftBank had the iPhone so everyone was going there. I didn't know any better and it was where my sponsor took me. 

When I went back stateside I kept forgetting I didn't need to go outside to use my phone- it was strange."

44304,best items under $100,"Goats are browsers, not grazers.  They don't eat grass unless there's nothing else; they much prefer leaves, flowers, bark and such.  What you want is a sheep."
69260,best major to study in college,"I agree with /u/HarbisonCarnegie. I just graduated with a degree in finance from a highly ranked school and still, more accounting courses would have been the ideal supplement. In hindsight, there are a few problems with studying finance. 

Finance is largely a soft skill in the sense that it gives you an understanding of market participants, investment strategies and financial concepts. This is fine and all but when you graduate, you'll want hard, marketable skills, ie accounting.

Second, finance is a somewhat saturated field. It's more glamorous than accounting and attracts more students. Unfortunately, there is much stronger demand for accountants than financial analysts. In my opinion, by adding an accounting concentration/minor, you'll be setting yourself up for success.

I'm not too familiar with supply chain management although I've heard that it's a growing, in demand field. Law is a SUPER saturated field."
