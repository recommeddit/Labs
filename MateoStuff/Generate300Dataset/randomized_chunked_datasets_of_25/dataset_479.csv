22845,best celebrity,"""I wish I could tell you that fultron fought the good fight, and the trolls let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but Reddit is no fairy-tale world. 

He never said who did it, but we all knew. Things went on like that for awhile - commenting on reddit consists of routine, and then more routine. Every so often, fultron would show up with fresh downvotes. 

The trolls kept at him - sometimes he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not. And that's how it went for fultron - that was his routine. 

I do believe those first two years were the worst for him, and I also believe that if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. """
30638,best Mexican war to study,"I dont remember hearing that the zimmerman telegram said ""if"" the US joins.  Not saying it isnt true, I just dont think I have ever heard that.  I always heard it was more of hey if you declare war, you get your old territory back if we win."

28201,best breakfast foods,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon- sue me- and since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that."
36623,best alcoholic drink,I like the Johnnie Walker - Blue Label.
33624,best electric car,"Hey OP, we have a 2016 Leaf SV (with the 30kwh battery) and have daily driven it since April 2016. It has about 28000 miles.

It gets driven to work daily, 22 miles round trip, with about 2/3 of that being freeway (60+ mph). When it gets home it is at about 77% battery left.

We used the included ""Level 1"" trickle charger that came with the car for about six months, before getting a 220v outlet put in so we could use a Level 2 charger. We use a Siemens EVSE, which I'll not review since it belongs to and features are managed by my electric utility (as part of a study).

We have charged to 100% every day, and our range has not been degrading, or at least we haven't noticed. At full charge, the guessometer still says about 110 miles. We are not missing any bars yet.

City driving will maximize that range.  Hills use the battery charge faster (no, you won't get all of it back going down the other side, but some).  Freeway speeds also eat up battery charge compared to City driving. 

Day trips 50 miles away by highway are a coin flip whether it will make it back for the return leg without charging.  We use our ICE for those or we plan to charge if it's more than 30 miles away. The level 1 charger is fine for overnight charging at a hotel or campground, but you'll want to get permission first.

Road trips are not what this car was made for. I'm in Washington state, and going cross state is still pretty tedious thanks to the rate of expenditure at highway speeds. We use our ICE for those trips too.

Maintenance is excellent. I replaced the cabin air filter this Spring, and we have purchased one set of tires.  I recommend staying on top of tire rotations, because the torquey front wheels have worn through a lot faster than the rears.

Our lease is up in April, and we are planning to buy the car out for residual. We love it. I hope you do too!"
38169,best Marvel movie,"Love Infinity War! This isn’t the sole reason but to keep it brief, I was completely shocked by the ending as I think most were. I don’t agree with “we know they’re not really dead” as a criticism because the characters don’t know that! And in the interim before Endgame came out, I could actually kinda see (like 10% possible) how every character that vanished was either replaceable or wouldn’t really be missed. 

And if nothing else, it feels like a $300 million production of kids smashing their superhero action figures together"

57649,best cologne,"I really like Eau Sauvage (not to be confused with Dior Sauvage), one of the all time classics. My other favorite is Caswell Massey Lime, which has been discontinued and has left me heartbroken. If anyone's familiar with this scent specifically and can offer a recommendation of something that's similar, please feel free to chime in (but please don't suggest Royall Lyme, not even close)!"
41459,best instrument to play,Well that's just not true. I love piano but I made a special point of learning smaller instruments because I love to play music while camping and backpacking. Piano can't do that.
21923,best celebrity,"Gene Wilder, but there’s a story behind this...

I worked at a pharmacy in the ‘80s and was asked to deliver medicine to Gilda Radner (Gene’s wife) during her cancer battle.  After a long delay to make the delivery due to issues related to the getting in touch with her doctor, I was finally given the prescription and drove up to their house to make the delivery.  During my drive, I was excited at meeting one of the brightest comedy stars of the time...

When I arrived, I rang the doorbell and Gilda answered.  I knew she was sick, but even I was surprised at her gaunt appearance - she did not look well at all.  Immediately, I realized she was very angry because of the long delay in getting the medicine to her.  Unfortunately, she let loose all that anger at me.  I apologized many times (even though I had nothing to do with the delays).

After she finished and I gave her the prescription, she closed the door on me.  I was not upset at her, though - indeed, I was very sad - that this brilliant comedienne was sick and was going through such an absolutely awful ordeal...  This was an awful situation and not at all as I had hoped my encounter would go.

As I turned around to walk away from the door, I went several steps before I felt someone tap my shoulder.  I turned around and it was Gene, letting me know that his wife was very sick and he apologized many times for her behavior.  He then gave me a nice tip for the delivery service and shared his gratitude for the weekend delivery and work by my pharmacy.

I'll never forget the encounter and appreciate that I got to meet both of them, even for a brief time, under difficult circumstances..."
