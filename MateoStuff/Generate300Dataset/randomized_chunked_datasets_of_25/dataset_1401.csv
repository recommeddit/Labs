59091,best perfume,"Friendly warning - be careful it isn't just a case of you having [olfactory fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue), aka ""nose blindness""   
Our senses tend to tune out constant stimuli so we don't miss any other potentially important stimuli.  It's the same reason we generally can't smell our own homes.  
  
This happens to a lot of people who regularly wear fragrances and they wind up unknowingly wearing way too much... don't be that person, nobody likes them  :("

I was 90% certain I knew who the killer was upon the limbo dance sequence -- the killer needed to get access to Giles' phone.

I was right.  The only thing that made me doubt myself was perhaps the killer was using a stooge to get the access."

13072,best gifts for mom,My mom moved to North Carolina 4 years ago (I'm im California) This summer was the first time I saw her in two years and 3 years since all of my sisters and mom and I were together. Her boyfriend had a training in LA so I got my sisters together and my mom and recreated an old glamor shot we took in the early to mid 90's. I'm a cosmetologist so I did everyone's makeup and hair and I'm having my roommate photoshop it. I haven't posted any version of it on social media so I'm hoping she forgot about it. I'm sending it to her in a nice frame and trying to get my older sister to send her the original for Christmas as well :).
