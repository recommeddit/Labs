44820,"* Organic Basics SilverTech Tee (\~$70) - I'll concede, that's quite expensive for what is in essence just a basic black t-shirt, but that's pretty much all I wear year round anyways. odourless / crease resistant / pretty well insulated. I have about a week's supply and cycle through them.
* Klean Kanteen Insulated Bottle (\~$25) - Used roughly every day for 5-6 years, this kinda feels like a BIFL purchase at this point. given how well it has withstood a good amount of falls / bumps",best items under $100

While not bifl, apple provides software and hardware support for it's handsets far longer than most Android phones.

There are two Android phones going the user replaceable components; fairphone and teracube with hopefully more to follow just so you are aware of alternatives.

Iphone 12 mini should be at a really good price once the 13 comes out in September supposedly.

The SE2 is probably the best option currently.",best iPhone

How do you rate the [Deuter Giga](http://www.deuter.com/de_DE/rucksack-details.php?category=72&artnr=80419&title=Giga)? I've had one for just half a year now and the inner side of the staps is starting to fray a little, otherwise it looks fine. If it's likely to develop more defects with the years, I'd like to know about them.

I have searched the previous backpack threads, and Deuter has been mentioned four times, thrice without much details and neither time relating to this model.",best backpack for college

58544,"If you have a LUSH in your area, my favourite scent is Breath of God. It's unisex, and the notes I particularly love are quite masculine. It starts off smelling really weird/bad, but when it warms to your skin maybe half an hour later it smells like sexy magic sexytimes. I use it myself, as I tend to prefer most masculine scents over feminine ones. But if I smelled it on a guy I'd definitely think it was sexy, and also points for going to LUSH.",best cologne
