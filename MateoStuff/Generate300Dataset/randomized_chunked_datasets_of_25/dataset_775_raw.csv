"I was surprised too. Maybe because they're only found in a relatively small corner of the Earth. People also often get them confused with giant sequoias. Anyway, they're my favorite. Redwood National Park is straight up magical."
Emacs dired-mode. And I use emacs for almost everything except browser and some graphical suites like gimp or ardour.
"Currently going through the program right now. Struggling with grades, social life, money, and doing my laundry but nothing is more satisfying than finishing a project"
"++ On the repair - I sent mine in with a cracked lens - and got a new pair.

They're either on croakies or they're on my bag (still on croakies). I'm fucking terrible with losing things, so unless they're literally strapped to me, I'll lose it.

You can take the boy out of the frat, but you can't the the frat out of the boy."
"It's an alternative history book about what the world would look like if there was magic, more or less. It's set in 19th century England, and follows the lives of two magicians as they attempt to re-introduce magic into day-to-day society in England. As others have said, it's fantastic, you just have to make it through the first little bit first (which is somewhat dry) before you get to the really great stuff."
"Agreed, the Economist doesn't slot neatly into either political persuasion in the U.S. and a lot of Americans perceive that as unbiased - they are a strongly pro-free market, pro-western, pro-Value Added news organization."
You sound fun.
Straight Jack Daniels only has like 60 calories. Take three and chase with water and you should be fine for < 200 calories.

"I literally use a ""Note"" on my phone which has every single bill I pay.
Everytime I am paid, I look into my bank account through online banking, and subtract my ""Bill total"" from that amount, I now know EXACTLY how much money I have to start planning shopping with and any other potential expenses such as petrol etc.
I then have that figure listed under all of my bills, along with any potential outgoings listed underneath that I wouldn't classify as bill i.e food, petrol, savings etc. 
I normally spend around the same each month on food etc, so allow myself say £30 a week for food shopping, x4, and I have £120 to take away from my ""total figure"" after all of my bills have come out, under all of the expenses, I then have listed my ""me money"" as it were, that I can either spend or save, without fear of missing a bill or not having food covered. It can be a pain to type and set up at first, but at the click of a few buttons I can clearly see at any time how much money I have free, after all bills and expenses. Really does help you see and save as well in my opinion, you feel a lot more in control of your money."
"If you like romantic suspense, read the LOST Series by [Cynthia Eden](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/author/ref=dbs_P_W_auth?_encoding=UTF8&author=Cynthia%20Eden&searchAlias=digital-text&asin=B001IU0Q46)  (really anything by Cynthia Eden). 

If you like vampires, Black Dagger Brotherhood by [J.R. Ward](https://www.amazon.com/J.-R.-Ward/e/B001H6OGQA). 

Contemporary two of my favorites were [The Boy I Hate](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-I-Hate-Taylor-Sullivan-ebook/dp/B0745JT2M5)  and [Hooked On You](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-You-Brittany-Anne-ebook/dp/B07B3ZRXH4/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) . 

I’m not much of a paranormal romance person, but the Bad Things Series is AMAZING, by Cynthia Eden. Sooooo good. 

Historical Romance, I adore Julie Garwood’s [The Bride](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004XFYWNY/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524498104&sr=1-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=the+bride+julie+garwood) . 

And if you want something drama-filled and totally chaotic but still somehow satisfying (eventually), checkout [Lovers and Gamblers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B018HM9OLI/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524498250&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=lovers+and+gamblers+by+jackie+collins)  by Jackie Collins. This book made me very mad but it ended up worth it, lol."

">I can't find any information whatsoever regarding your first claim.

As you can imagine, it's very hard to find the search string involving mention of a ""tour of pearl harbor"" that doesn't refer to people touring the tourist attraction. I don't have an article handy but this is a rarely discussed historical event, seen variously as embarrassing or telling. 

>I'm not sure why you think they were ""dregs""? What gives you the impression that numerous battleships (including Admiral Kimmel's flagship), cruises, and destroyers are the dregs?

I may be mistaken, but I was of the impression that these were mostly old wooden deck ships, and the modern ships were out to sea at the time. 

>That doesn't make them any more useful than the ships at Pearl Harbor. Eight of the nine battleships that made up the strength of the Pacific Fleet were sunk.

Old, outdated, outmoded ships. Sacrificial cows to cajole the public into accepting war."
"Is it possible to brush your teeth too hard? My SO sounds like he's trying to sand his teeth off and it makes me uncomfortable. Not sure if it's just misophonia or if maybe he is brushing too hard.

*sometimes it is really surprising what things generate a whole bunch of discussion. I never would have expected so many people were so interested in talking about how hard you should brush your teeth"

"PSPad is very good (and free). Ultraedit is good as a paid solution, though the only reason I like it beter than PSPad is because it supports SFTP transfer to remote hosts."

An air compressor to air up your tires. Got one off Amazon for 30 bucks.
"Hi, working with the budget, I'd go for the Gateway 14.1"" on my list. i5-1135G7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14.1"" display. It should be fine for general use and light video editing."
"Easy to pick up and play? Harmonica or Ukulele. Harmonica always stays in key and you can play a lot of songs off ear right off the bat. The technique isn't incredibly difficult to learn off the internet and pretty much no music theory is needed. Ukulele is a very calming instrument, and the fact that its pretty small means you don't need to stretch too far to hit some chords like with a guitar (although it can get quite cramped). Tabs are relatively easy to learn, the harder part would be chord transitions and strum patterns which just take a little practice.  
  
Most fun to learn overtime and dedicate yourself to? Id go with a couple here. Vocals pays off very well, and results in some pretty instant relief from the musical urge. Piano and Guitar are classic, because of their versatility and wide, rich range. Computer Programs like Fruity Loops and DJ software are really interesting if you like tech. Drums, are probably one of my favourites because its one of my first instruments. You can play it without sheet music and it's more repetitive than the other instruments. Ukulele again, because its got an amazing sound. And ill have to finish it off with Saxophone, because its always fun recreating the Careless Whisper solo."
RO will get rid of pretty much everything. Our RO water tests at 9ppm compared to the tap water which sits at 300ppm of dissolved solids.

(Although get out of this thread if your worried about spoilers)

I guessed this twist for the same reason I guessed the sixth sense twist.
A seemingly unrelated scene at the start of the film that leaves you thinking ""what was the point in that?"""
