21026,best workout music,Look alive remix with a handful of rappers on youtube. Gets me really energetic
68287,best science fiction novel,"I love Rendezvous with Rama. It's not just a book about sciencey things like spaceships and robots. It's a book about people actually doing science. The characters aren't being attacked by aliens or trying to save the world. They're just walking around looking at stuff, making measurements, and taking notes. Nobody goes space crazy and tries to push anyone out an airlock. Everyone is reasonable and professional. It's the closest thing to a realistic depiction of a first encounter I've ever read."
54714,best water filter,"I've been using the same filters for two+ years. When it slows down you can clean it with an abrasive pad. See the instructions.

Best water filter ever."
53980,best medicine for a cold,"Indeed. When I go to the doctor for my colds, as required by my work, my doctor always tells me, ""There's nothing quite like the curative properties of a good night's rest when you have a cold."" He then writes me a note for an additional 2 days off of work and a prescription for prescription strength NyQuil to ,""knock me out.""  It's basically the original green death flavor NyQuil one could buy before psuedoephedereine was taken off the OTC list."
31706,best hotel to live in,"Ah, another good question.  I know the area extremely well since I get bored easily and constantly try new things.  I go out about 3-4 times a week to bars but mostly on the weekdays since I hate crowds.  I have found it hard to start seeing women when on the road.  For starters, they always tell me that going back to a hotel makes them feel like a whore.  Secondly, they know you're there temporarily and regardless of how easy going they seem after two weeks they want to know ""where is this going?"".  I like meeting new people, but nothing ever lasts.  Sometimes that's upsetting because I've met some really cool girls."

28246,best breakfast foods,"No time: parfait. Granola, yogurt, fruit. Sometimes some honey depending on the fruit, sometimes some nuts depending on the granola. 

Time: grilled cheese with tomato and bacon, grits, eggs, slice of cantaloupe if I have it, OJ. Honestly any combination of meat, eggs, cheese, and toasted bread, with some fruit on the side."
22376,best celebrity,The fact that he remembered her after doing the event and then singled her out when others were mobbing him speaks volumes. Must be hard keeping track of so many things going on like that
45720,best trick or treating candy,I'm with you. Peanut butter is the devil's paste.
63552,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"My only problem with zebra is that I ignored the upgrades for a tweak then deleted it after some time and now it still appears in the app as ignored upgrades and when I press on it zebra crashes, other than that it’s better than sileo/Cydia for me.


Edit: whenever i copy a yt link even after 10-20 mins when opening zebra it asks me if I want to add the repo with that url, if that gets fixed it would be one of the best package manager ever."

58613,best cologne,"Ultramale or Eros? I want a sweet fragrance.

61338,Best RPG game on PS4,"I'm on my 3rd ps4 playthrough right now (and beat the first one twice) and I can say with certainty that it plays very well on controller.

The only thing that's a moderate pain in the ass is inventory management towards the end of the game"

33118,best energy drink,i love me some amphetamine salts
24370,best anime,"What a labor of love, hard favorite. It's nice to see some data aggregation being put to use to balance out top lists that, as you say, will usually skew hard on one genre. I'll be working my way down, thank you."
21602,best winnie the pooh comic,I was expecting [this](http://www.transformer-ivan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/poo_bear.jpg) lol. He really is a jerk.
