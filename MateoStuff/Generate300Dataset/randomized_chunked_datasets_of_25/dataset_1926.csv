68287,"I love Rendezvous with Rama. It's not just a book about sciencey things like spaceships and robots. It's a book about people actually doing science. The characters aren't being attacked by aliens or trying to save the world. They're just walking around looking at stuff, making measurements, and taking notes. Nobody goes space crazy and tries to push anyone out an airlock. Everyone is reasonable and professional. It's the closest thing to a realistic depiction of a first encounter I've ever read.",best science fiction novel

31706,"Ah, another good question.  I know the area extremely well since I get bored easily and constantly try new things.  I go out about 3-4 times a week to bars but mostly on the weekdays since I hate crowds.  I have found it hard to start seeing women when on the road.  For starters, they always tell me that going back to a hotel makes them feel like a whore.  Secondly, they know you're there temporarily and regardless of how easy going they seem after two weeks they want to know ""where is this going?"".  I like meeting new people, but nothing ever lasts.  Sometimes that's upsetting because I've met some really cool girls.",best hotel to live in
