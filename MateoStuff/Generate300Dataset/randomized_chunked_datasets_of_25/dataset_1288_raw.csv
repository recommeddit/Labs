Do you warm them up before eating them? If so how?
"How does someone ""do your own research"" without including reviews? Are you suggesting that no review sites are credible? 

There are dozens of VPN services. Are you advising people to use free trials to assess them all before buying? Assuming some VPN services are unsafe, unreliable or malware, your advice would include an unnecessary exposure to risk. 

Independent audits aren't a panacea or guarantee. They are better than no audits and unfounded claims of privacy and security. Are you suggesting that a level playing field exists for all VPNs? I ask because you've implied reviews, word of mouth and audits are redundant. 

I'm willing to bet you're using a well known VPN - Mullvad or Top 10 equivalent. You chose it from a limited number of higher profile VPNs with positive reviews and word of mouth."
"Ps4 because it has the most games,exclusive and diverse in category, as well as the most stable software. I have all three and just find the xbox way to buggy and annoying. Ps. I was a xbox 360 guy"

Canada in a nutshell.
Love Wellstone too but Russ voted against DOMA.
That does not sound good.
Check out the Mini SE. Perfect for your commute.
A true journey of self discovery
"Wow nobody rembers the classics ?
The great escape. Steve McQueen
 Where eagles dare Clint Eastwood
 The guns of Navaron. Gregory Peck
I know that they are all war movies
 But they grab your attention from the start
And don't let go"
"No matte screen protectors for me! I do only tempered glass screen protectors with oleophobic coating. I have switched to silicone tip covers to add a little texture, drag and quiet the tapping noise of the pencil on glass though. ;)

Why use a matte screen protector that dulls the gorgeous screen when you can just put a silicon tip on your Apple Pencil and accomplish the same thing without compromising screen clarity??"
"Very true. The only thing that will cure it is time.

You can make yourself more comfortable though. Plenty of fluids (hot, steamy preferably and some decongestants.)

Try some chicken noodle soup with hot sauce in it. That's as a good as any store-bought decongestant."
I buy all my vent covers from [SupplyHouse.com](supplyhouse.com) but they have tons of supplies!
Man i wish racing games with decent story and career modes
"I really like Nike running shoes.  I have a heavy foot fall and at 190 lbs my ankles and knees do not like a minimal shoe at all.  I like the Lunarlon quite a bit.  I wear out the outside of my shoes fairly quickly and they keep my ankles from hurting too.  

I have a thick foot with a high arch.  I have owned Brooks, Nike, Asics, Adidas, and New Balance.  I like Nike the best, with New Balance coming in a close second and preferred for trail/hiking shoes.  

It all depends on what you are using them for and how they fit your foot.  Just comes down to what feels best for you."
"CamelCamelCamel extension for Amazon price tracking. 

Many a times Amazon ""discounted"" prices are higher then regular and the extension gives you a price history of the product with the ability to send you a notification when it reaches a desirable price."
"Super rangy, ballhawk type of FS who has become a very aggressive and sound run sender as well. Itâ€™s nice to finally see him get his recognition."
"My suggestions:

- NOLA: I didn't see this mentioned, but New Orleans, Louisiana may be of interest to you. They have a top notch football team (Saints) and some of the best food in the country. NOLA is known for the creole/cajun style food, but you can also find some pretty awesome BBQ places... For your girl, there is PLENTY of nightlife and drinking. Shopping around the city is also very *unique*. Not any theme parks though, however there is a Casino... There is really no other city in America like New Orleans. 

- Tennessee, as suggested by others. Memphis and Nashville are a few hours apart, but between the two, you will find some of THE BEST BBQ in the country. You will also have the Tennessee Titans in Nashville for your Football. As for nightlife/clubs/drinking, you should be able to find some places in both of those cities. I don't know about any extraordinary shopping, but I'm sure there are some nice malls... Also, if you like the outdoors, consider going further east (almost into North Carolina) to the Great Smoky Mountains. There is some great hiking and camping. 

- New York City. Of course I'm going to mention NYC. You have two football teams to choose from, the Giants or the Jets. If you go in September, you'll also have baseball, with either the Yankees or the Mets (though I'd choose to see the Yankees).... NYC definitely has plenty of nightlife and the best shopping in the US for your girlfriend... and while NYC isn't a BBQ mecca like the SouthEast, they have a place called *Dinosaur Bar-B-Que* which has the best BBQ you'll find in the North... There is so much to see and do in NYC, I promise you won't get bored!

- Off to the west coast, Los Angeles and San Diego California. The two cities are a few hours apart, but both are worth a visit. You have the San Diego Chargers for football. Both have excellent shopping and nightlife, and you also have some of the nicest beaches in the entire country! The food is excellent, though I cant comment on BBQ in particular... and as for theme parks, you have the original, iconic Disney Land. 

- San Francisco. There is no city like it. The weather is almost always cool and breezy. There is excellent shopping and great food (but again, no comment on BBQ). With a few hours of driving, you could be at the beautiful Yosemite National Park, which is definitely worth visiting. You also have the pacific coast which is nice, though it wont be as warm as LA or San Diego... For football you have a choice between the 49er's or the Raiders over in Oakland (I'd choose the 49er's).

- Denver, Colorado. I LOVE DENVER. You have the Denver Broncos for football, decent nightlife in the city, and some decent shopping. Denver isn't as well known for their cuisine, but they do have some excellent food! This is the city for you if you're an outdoorsy person because you have the Rocky Mountains near by for camping and hiking!"
Pathology had a great surprise ending.
No Lamar Jackson is blasphemous.
Now that's a fair point
"Tough choice.  I'm gonna go with the ones I didn't just meet, but got to spend some time with.

Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul, and Mary fame) is one of the nicest *people* I've ever met.  Plus, he gave us ""Puff, the Magic Dragon.""  He told me ""hey man, I really think we're brothers of the spirit.""  So I got that going for me.

Next up, Kenny Rogers.  RIP.  Got to spend an hour with him a little over 20 years ago.  Gracious, funny, and self-deprecating.

Finally, I got to spend an hour with Bob Uecker (the ""just a bit outside"" guy from the Major League movies) a couple times.  An encyclopedia of baseball knowledge, a fountain of old Hollywood stories (he told me about how he got on the Tonight Show with Carson and what it was like to do the old Friar's Roasts with Sinatra, Dean, and Sammy) and just all around a cool person."
Boobs......usually any girls boobs.
I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York several years ago.  That was pretty nice.
