27902,"For me my perfect breakfast goes a little something like this... 

I start off with 2 slices of fresh pagnotta bread, then I trot over to the BBQ cue and fire that lovely machine up! Now that the barby has reached a fiery heat I gently place the slices of bred onto the grill. After the first minute I flip each slice in order to get a nice crosshatch grill mark. A few more seconds go by and it is time to start the party. 

I gather some extra virgin olive oil, place my finger tip onto its tap leaving only a slight opening and then I begin to slowly drizzle drazzle this golden liquid onto the canvas that is the bread. As the party starts to get rockin I then add a slibba slabba of fresh ricotta (my nonna knows a guy, none of that store bought crap) and spread each slice with a block of cheese, going from Iqaluit to Havana then back up to the great North. Now that the guests have settled in, I take a teaspoon and scoop up some sugar and like a snowfall on a sunny winter day in Montreal, I sprinkle sprankle it on top of the ricotta. 

As I am doing this, the whistle of my 2 cup cafetiere begins to sing. The espresso is finally coming to completion and it is then that I take that cafetiere and gently let the bitter yet delicious nectar cascade into my espresso cup. 

Then in a matter of seconds, I scarf the who fucking thing down and return to life as it was.",best breakfast foods
31877,"Most high-end luxury hotels definitely will do this as well, plus it is usually not hard to get what are normally crazy expensive options (like laundry) tossed in.  I recommend asking for laundry, club lounge (if this is an option at the hotel), breakfast, and percentage off of hotel dining/room service.  My experience is maybe 10% of luxury hotels don't feel the need to discount long term stays.  I would add, be sure and do your research first, certainly one big reason ""high-end luxury hotels"" discount is that they are lacking compared to the competition.

It is also the case that brand loyalty can matter, if I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for three months and then switch to the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, this usually helps a lot.

I'd also recommend though that what is usually the best deal for the month are serviced apartments.  Most people are there for extended stays, and the standard pricing is often monthly.

70482,"Best: it's an extremely versatile path, with virtually no cap on upward mobility. Business majors are never ""tied down"" to one path and you can bounce around from different careers quite a bit and still keep all of your experience as relevant-- like if I wanted to go from say, advertising to product development, market research, or even something totally left field like event manager, I can do that without raising any eyebrows (which is a *really* good thing for job security and for all that money you lose by not changing jobs somewhat regularly).

Worst: stereotyping. People tend to simultaneously think business degrees are easy/business majors can't hack it in other fields, yet also think business majors have some weird like ""evil mega corporation"" thing going on.
