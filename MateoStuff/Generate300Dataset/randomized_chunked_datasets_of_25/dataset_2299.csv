54404,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"That's what I'm sayin. Get something that's of good build quality, looks good on your desk and your skin appreciates. Nothing wrong with that.

All this friction force and grams bullshit is just too much. I felt like I had to say my two cents lol"

31189,best country to live in,"I'm a 30yo software engineer with ~10 years industry experience and a fair few accomplishments under my belt.  I _know_ that the premier place to live and work for my profession is around the bay area, but I just can't bring myself to relocate my family to the US.  Even looking past my healthcare concerns, guns scare the shit out of me and every time I've visited the US I have been on edge whenever I saw cop walking around with a firearm, knowing that he could kill or main me in a second"
70256,best major to study in college,">It's a bit of a bummer that so many people look down on English 

People definitely treat English as an underwater basket weaving degree but honestly the unemployment rate for English majors is pretty much on par with most other majors give or take 1-2%. Most of the people I know that haven't found gainful employment after college didn't try to get internships or anything beyond their degree and their resume ends up looking like they worked summers in their local grocery store, went to college and graduated with nothing in between. 

I love reading and writing but the reading aspect can be very tedious, it's not fun for me to read 17th century british literature but I stomach it. My school also has 3-4 different pairings with English where there's Creative Writing, Teaching, English Lit and Professional Writing. I took the Professional Writing pairing because it gives a lot of classes on marketing, business and technical writing which is my end goal."
7820,best laptop for general use,"I'm hoping someone here can help me? I'm trying to buy a laptop to replace my outdated chromebook and my struggling Dell laptop, I study programming but admittedly hardware is not my strong suit.

My biggest problem with my Dell is that it struggles with multitasking. When I'm working on projects I like having open web browser, software like VSC or Eclipse, Word, etc open concurrently. It lags to load things, and certain webpages will trigger it to stutter. I don't need anything fancy, just something powerful enough to run the above programs and be able to handle some multitasking without making the experience maddeningly sluggish. 

Everything else is sort of secondary, I just want a laptop that can keep up, preferably for under $500. Any advice?"

30388,best Mexican war to study,"When he was 30, Caesar saw a statue of Alexander the Great and wept, lamenting that Alexander had accomplished more than he yet at a younger age.

Then Caesar went on to conquer France, invade Britain, and then win a civil war against the combined armies of the Senate of Rome. I would argue that he is in fact more famous, and has had a more lasting impact, than Alexander.

So do not feel lazy, my friend, before these prodigies who at earlier ages had already acquired fame and fortune, but think rather on Caesar, who stood in your shoes and wept, and then went on to conquer the world."
23414,best car racing video game,"Forza Horizon 2 - that is the best racing game on xbox one.  I loved it, much more engaging than 3 and 4 because it is more about racing and the scenery is awesome.
