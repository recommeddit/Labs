73688,best matte screen protector for ipad,No I have never bought paperlike. Wayyyy too expensive for what the function is. I bought the 2 pack iCarez for half the price and I still have the original one I put on 4 months ago. Still looks brand new and I usually wipe it down lightly once a week for hand oils.

37222,best amusement park,I always see people crap on Magic Mountain for not having much besides their coasters but I never see that complaint about Cedar Point. SFMM could definitely use more but Cedar Point has some even bigger gaps (like a dark ride) but no one ever talks about that.
67857,best science fiction novel,Speaker for the Dead over Enderâ€™s Game?  I read both long ago in high school but Enderâ€™s Game had the impact on me for being the start of the series.  I liked the series in general but my memories vague.  Liked the philosophical nature of them even though the plot advancement was painfully slow for my high school mind.  The Enderâ€™s Shadow branch of the series appears largely silly to me now despite being more action packed.  Think that branch got more silly with each subsequent book.
