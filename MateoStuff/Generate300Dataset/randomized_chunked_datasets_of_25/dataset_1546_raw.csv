Mostly Vim. Started out due to availability and working a lot through SSH on servers but eventually I got faster with it than with regular editors.
"Yeah, it's called The Barkley Marathons. Crazy race indeed, very inspiring :)"
"I just got this one this weekend and set it up yesterday, it's great. no complaints! definitely a huge steal for only $299"
How do you make mullvad fast? Its slowing my internet a lot. Pls help
I saw a decent tedx talk on finding your life purpose. Something with asking 5 questions or it only taking 5 minutes in the title. Not sure whether it works as I already know my life purpose but might give some info.
I recommend using Mathematica for graphing in calc 3.  Physics 2 won't need anything beyond your ti83.
"This might not be what you are looking for and depending on how you feel about subtitles but just in case- ""Caliphate"" (Kalifat original title) Drama/Thriller 8.2/10 on imbd. Still a new series but so far rottentomatoes says Fresh with an average rating of 4.63"

"The Dispossessed, Left Hand of Darkness, and Dune, probably, it's hard to pick."
"I got the 128gb iPhone 11 because the 256GB 11 Pro Max (11 Pro is too small for me) is a solid $800 more expensive here in Canada and I can't justify that price, as much as I love OLED having used Samsung phones in the past.
