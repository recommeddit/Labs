22974,"Rory McCann (The Hound from Game of Thrones). He was in Sydney, and I figured I never get this opportunity any other time, so I went up to him. He was very nice and shook my hand. He didn't want a photo, but not a big deal, was just cool to meet him! 

And this was like a few days right after his chicken episode where he was like ""I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room""",best celebrity

68155,"More of a combination of individual books and series:

* Dune by Frank Herbert- I like the entire series but the original book is best.
* Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.
* Ringword Series by Larry Niven - in fact most of his Known Space collection is good.
* Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement.
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey - started watching the show and read the books and they have really revived my love of reading which I have to admit has dwindled in the past while.

There are many more I hold in equal esteem but I will limit to the original request of 5.",best science fiction novel

34261,">PFF basically says that Mack consistently wins his 1-1 matchups and that matters more to them and their rankings than raw sack numbers.

As it should. Sacks happen 5-15 times a year for most. Why in the world would we limit our evaluation to maybe 10 reps a year over the other 600 times they were on the field? Give me someone with no sacks winning 25% of the time over someone like Jarran Reed having 7 sacks as a DT while being fucking awful on the rest of his reps",best NFL player
