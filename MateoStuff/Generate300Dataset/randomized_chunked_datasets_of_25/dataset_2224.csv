69550,"Yeah, PhDs are way too specialized.  With a bachelor's, you have the flexibility to make lattes at Starbucks one year, and then call back on your college experience once something better paying opens up.  With a PhD, everyone assumes you have no interest in anything but your field of study and wouldn't want to throw your degree away doing something unrelated.",best major to study in college

69873,"College does help, but don't waste your money going to any big shot art institute. Really look at what your college options are what kind of program they offer, I'd say their web classes are a good indications of how up to date they are with current trends and development.

My college had a decent design program but shitty web classes, pretty much had to teach myself web after I graduated.

In the end though what really matters is the quality of your work. So try to find inspiration from everything. Also finding a job right out of college can be a real bitch unless you have excellent talent and networking skills. But don't expect to get the job your looking for right away.

Also I wouldn't limit yourself to just UI design. Yes UI design is getting huge, but that's just a small portion of what most employers look for. There's print, web, identity, illustration, etc... I have heard it's good to focus, but don't ignore these other areas.",best major to study in college

33543,"I own this car. I have the Pro S version. It's my 4th EV and by far my favorite. My husband has a Model 3 LR. The ID.4 doesn't charge as fast as the Model 3, but it does 10-80% in about 38 min, which is SO much faster than the Bolt I owned. Although, I normally just charge at home on our L2 so it's not a huge deal. When on trips it takes a good bit of time to go in to use the bathroom, order food and eat so the 38 min is no big deal either. The ride is so much more comfortable, especially with passengers in the back. I've been getting about 3.6 kWh but I've also been driving in B Eco mode and have been driving EVs since 2011 and have learned how to maximize efficiency. I will say in my previous EVs I didn't use the heat and air as much to get this rate, but I have the air on in the ID.4. To date I'm getting about 280 miles when charged to 100%. Although I typically don't charge over 80% unless I'm going on a trip. I also don't drive over 70mph on the highway. I can't say enough great things about this car. The one negative is the Car-Net App is certainly lacking compared to the Bolt and the Tesla Apps, but I hear they are working on that.",best electric car
