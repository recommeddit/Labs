I bought everclear for the first time the other day and I’m usually a rum/whiskey/scotch drinker... I was taken aback by how strong it was omg
"*Whose Land is This?*

FEEL THE POWER OF THE LION AS HE ROARS LIKE LIKE THUN-DEEEEEEEER!!!

Not a great weight lifting song but a fantastic jogging song."
Fourth vote for cat.
"“Hmm... this mannequin has human flesh and bone inside... Wait a second...

uh oh.

Do you have a good recipe? My husband loves corn beef hash. Thank you!
"Really the only answer is the chin nod at that time of day. I used to see famous people in NYC when I lived there in my 20's. I made a point to use the chin nod all the time, I would never, ever say a word to them. That's until I saw Sean Penn piss on a fire hydrant and I had to yell out, ""Nice dick!"" At least I think it was him, the group I was in seemed to agree."
I meant stock valuation is cheaper
Name of the company by chance? I live on the east coast but that sounds like an awesome idea
"One reason among several: because COVID19. When you sell every single webcam in existence, at whatever price you want, and still can't cover most of the demand... why bother making them better?

Outside of this, the usual pretext is ""customers don't care about webcams"". Which is absolutely untrue, but the way they ask the question in studies/surveys is wrong and lead to this assumption."
"DiRT 2 is fun* 

DiRT 3 was the one with all the impossible gymkhana shit that you could never get gold medals in. It drove my OCD up the fucking wall"
"That too, of course. But that is not the case for most of us. Hell, knowing the right person in general helps. I've scored jobs from professors, peers, family, old co-workers... I mean, the options are endless as long as you're not a total SAP or asshole."
We sure don’t perform like the 11th most valuable team
"Oh, no i completely agree with this discussion. I meant nothing by that comment. I only said it as a random piece of information. I didn't mean it to come off as rude."
Yup. I'd dump my IR degree and change to a nursing degree in a heartbeat.

I'm actually telling the truth. I'm not trying to discredit Firefox. I love Firefox. It just has too many issues *for me personally* to use it as my daily driver.

This is an objectively false statement. 

Maybe don't go around assuming you know everything about everyone and every situation."
"Thanks mate, much appreciated"
I'm not really much of a History person but I enjoyed the World War II documentary series. I would also recommend Inside Bill's Brain and The Story of Diana if you want to understand more of Bill Gates and Princess Diana.
The absolute size of shrek
Believe... When I say
Yes indeed!
"Don't forget social commentary, specifically discussion on the burden of reproduction."
Right? I learned so much in this video. This story is quite mysterious. I didn't know about the random banknotes that they found on the river bank.
I made this [maple ice cream](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/maple-ice-cream-recipe.html) for Thanksgiving and it was terrific.
"1.) Tom Holland - Best without a doubt

2.) Toby Maguire - Great in Spider-Man 1 and 2, but not what I think of Peter Parker

3.) Andrew Garfield - Great Spider-Man and older Peter Parker, but not a good young High School age Peter Parker."
Thanks changed
