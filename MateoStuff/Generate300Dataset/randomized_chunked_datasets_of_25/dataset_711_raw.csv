Is touchscreen important?
Exactly. Great for their time but dont age well. Look like pure cheese now. This new one is awesome.
"Yep, I paid $1100 CDN for my Acer Predator 144hz 1440p gsync monitor in 2016. The technology is only just catching up now."

The googlers [advise](https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/) aiming for 170 kB at the most. I don't think I've ever met this target :-)"
No there was a salt tree planted right next to the mango tree.
"While they physics aren't realistic, they sure are fun... always feel like you're holding on to the wheel for life at the edge of grip.  Also has one of the most realistic single player career progressions out there... and I love how you can choose your path (eg, stick with open wheel from bottom to top) and not be forced in to unwanted events."

"It's also perhaps worth noting that the author of this list is [a regular contributor to Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/author/andrew-liptak/) (publisher of 3 of the titles recommended in the main list in that article, plus another 2 if you include the parent/sibling Tor Books line), and [has a non-fiction book about cosplay coming out from Saga Press this year](https://www.andrewliptak.com/blog/cosplay-book-saga-press-science-fiction-star-wars-costuming-announcement) (publisher of 3 of the books in the main list).

This isn't intended as a Puppyish or GG-esque ""ethics in book recommendations"" conspiracy theory; rather, I think it's fair to say that we all have our own bubbles and interests, and both Tor.com and Saga Press are pretty progressive (or whatever term you prefer) - the senior editor of Tor.com was reported [in an interview](https://sffdirect.com/report-science-fiction-convention-ytterbium-eastercon-2019#fifth) as saying ""Tor.com Publishing is pretty left wing anyway.""

*(EDIT 'cos Reddit crapped out on me before I finished)* As such, the make-up of the list isn't that surprising, in the same way you'd expect a set of recommendations from, say [an academic who's also an SF writer, writing in a left-ish British newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/28/best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-books-of-2020) to come up with a fairly different list based on their biases/interests/cultural background."

"I'm not saying that that Milan team isn't worthy, 3x European Cups (champions league) in 5 years is something that's almost impossible to do, Barca is close with 2x Cups in 3 years.

But in my honest opinion 2009-2011 Barca would break any team 

Xavi Iniesta in their prime, that was just scary"
"Holland's Spider-Man doesn't really feel like Spider-Man to me. He feels like an entirely different character. Not necessarily a bad thing because the MCU is vastly different to the main universe, but he just doesn't feel like Spider-Man to me."
