"idk if there's any hard data out there but anecdotally Edge seems to use significantly less RAM than Chrome, even with all the same extensions and tabs open."

When he died, it was a few months before Father's Day. I put a package of socks on his tombstone when Father's Day came."

"The only time I read a physhical newspaper is when I read the free commuter news paper [Metro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_International), otherwise I check out the news online."
Never even heard of Knoebels...
Lol. I actually sent this to my husband and told him that these in physical book form would make a perfect Christmas present. I am taking an internet hiatus from Dec 24-Jan 1 and was planning to re-read some caveman erotica but this would be better
"Only when I get it free on my way to university or when entering an airplane. Otherwise I don't.

It's a waste of money and ressources. All the trees that fall for newspapers and all the lasting things I don't buy for the money I save... no thank you, there is more and more detailed information to be found in the internet AND it's much faster available."
"Because you are here, I believe it is safe for me to assume that you spend an assload of time in front of your computer.  

You *need* a good chair. You can get a very nice office chair for under $100. I got mine at Staples, and that is far from the cheapest place to get one. Your butt, back, and legs will thank you. You may also consider a standing desk or an exercise ball to keep yourself from being too sedentary.  

Consider a mechanical keyboard. They are sturdy as hell and usually come with nice stuff like removable/replaceable keys to dvorak it up, put special colored keys on you WASD, whatever you want. You also have a lot of choices in switch type - I use Cherry Blacks because I got the keyboard on sale, but Blues are probably the best choice. There are also Browns, Reds, Whites, Clears, and others. Do research and get the best keyboard for YOUR hands. I spend more time typing than walking, it's even more important than my shoes.  

Mouse too. Figure out how you hold your mouse, estimate the size of your hand, and then find a really good mouse of a style that will make you most comfortable. Don't skimp on the mousepad either.  

This will probably be over $100, but a second/third monitor can make a bigger difference than you might expect. I spend the majority of my life sitting in front of a computer, as I suspect many Redditors do, so it is important to make this experience as comfortable, healthy, and enjoyable as possible."
"If you guys don't want a pet, don't get one. It's pretty simple. She's 8 and yeah, she wants a dog, but I wanted a pony and didn't get one. She can have a dog when she's older and lives on her own, or when you guys are more ready for the task.

*If* you really want to scratch this itch, you guys do have the option to foster a dog through a rescue or shelter in your area. The benefits to fostering is many-fold, but here are some highlights:

* The dog is temporary and if things escalate beyond your capabilities, the rescue and shelter will always take them back, that's their job.

* The dog's needs are often paid for by the organization, including medications, food, etc.

* You actually save 2 lives in one go because you house the dog you're fostering and make space in the rescue or shelter for another dog to also be saved.

* Your daughter gets to experience the joy of a dog, helping the dog adjust to ""family life"", and gets to unite this animal with their forever family, which can be a sad, but rewarding experience.

* You can do it repeatedly or just once, without feeling like you're living in a zoo 24/7."
Thanks! I sure will do!

Agree. These are my favorite shoes to run in.

"Just so you know you don't need to wrap the axios promise chain in an explicit Promise, even to drill down into the response. You can just return the axios call itself which will end up returning whatever you returned from the last .then() call. That should simplify your code a bit.

&#x200B;

So something like (sorry for no formatting): return [axios.post](https://axios.post)(<stuff>).then(res => return [res.data](https://res.data)). The last thing you return from the last .then() is what will be returned from the promise chain.

you don't even need to add the .catch() part in the method if you don't need to do anything with it at that point. You can instead add a .catch() to the method outside when you call it.

&#x200B;

Also: If you like Promises make sure you take the time to learn how to do async/await instead. It transforms promises into a much much cleaner paradigm and can be used anywhere promises are. It might seem daunting at first glance but I promise you won't look back."

"I just got sick of the ads and other things. Under Intuit I think the ads have gotten more numerous. When I login the last thing I want to see is half a page of ads in my face. The $50 annual fee for YNAB is worth it just for no ads. 

Also Mint would miscategorize a lot of things so I would have to go back and correct them. Might as well do it myself upfront(YNAB) to start with. 

I also found I prefer the YNAB system more. It is the envelope system of budgeting. While Mint is more trying to forecast everything."
Yes. Can't recommend enough. I binged it this weekend.

"XS Max truly feels like it could be ‘future-proof’. Performance has held up, multitasking is smooth, design like a modernized take on my old favorite black iPhone 4, and iOS keeps getting more polished as time goes on. 

Plus it came at a crossroads as the first Max sized display, with added battery life from Plus line, and the last iPhone with 3D Touch. Haptic Touch is alright, but compared to LIDAR and a 3rd camera, it is part of what I use throughout the day, daily."
