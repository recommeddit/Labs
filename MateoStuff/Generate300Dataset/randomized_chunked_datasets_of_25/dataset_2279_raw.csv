"I started with java, and got stuck on arrays/classes, then i went to python, with i found way more easy to understand more complex stuff, and now i am studying JavaScript, that has a lot of similarity with java on the latest releases, I have no experience with PHP, so I don't know if is good for a first language, but i know that is focused on back-end"
I always wondered why eeyore is so miserable...
">Ace Combat Zero 

Fuck yes. I love the Ace Combat games on PS2. It pisses me off to no end that the latest one moved from the fictional universe of Strangereal to the real world. The new plot couldn't have been more generic. I actually haven't played it yet (waiting til I can find it for like ten bucks) but I've been reading up on it. It's just another Call of Duty ""Russian separatists have taken over the government"" plot and I hate it because the old AC games had amazing storylines. Ace Combat 4's plotline was awesome, what with Yellow Squadron and such. 5's story was great as well, and Zero's replayability can't be beaten.

I've been thinking recently about unpacking my old PS2 and playing the old AC games because I loved them so much."
"If that's a serious issue, learn shit on your own. I graduated in Political Science, and learn still almost as much about politics now as I do in school. Classes just teach you how to learn - all the information is (relatively) freely available now."
European checking in. Can't get enough peanut butter.
"A lot of people think cities, but the natural beauty of the west is truly breathtaking. The Rockies, Grand Canyon, Arches national park, Redwoods, the deserts of Arizona. I grew up in the foothills of Appalachia and it’s absolutely nothing compared to the scenery out west."
"Nightlife ending at 2AM... well Northern and central Europe are out of the question for you haha, thats when it really picks up!"
Everyones meant to be here....  but you.
We can make a religion out of this.

"I don't have a direct answer to this question as I was born in 96 and therefore missed a load of great teams. But I want to question Barca's place as the 'best club team ever'. What they do was amazing, I cannot deny but their longevity wasn't all there. 

In their 2009-2010 season they didn't win any other major award except for la liga title. And their reign in the league and europe ended after the 2012 season. So it was a Barca team from 2008-2011, where as you can compare that to Milan from 89-94 who got to FIVE european finals, where as Barca *only* got to two.

Imo if their span lasted a while longer they would have a bigger case, but I see the main reason of them popping up in these type of threads and and as a answer to the question is that they are the best team in recent times."

"It’s been a long time since I was in elementary or secondary school, but I don’t recall learning much about the Mexican-American War. I think that’s probably in large part because the Civil War sucks up all the air in the room. We spent a lot more time learning about that than other events in the 1800s."
"Thanks a lot for clarifying, Max! :)))"
Green Lantern is actually a fun ride. Viper is painful. I would even take Green Lantern over Goliath \+ Gold Rusher.
Glossier You. Good shit
Oh my gosh what a thorough reply! What should I plant in my very sunny yard in New Hampshire? Please and thank you.
"The Dutch national team has so many good players though, Virgil, De Ligt, Dumfries, Wijnaldum, Memphis, Bergwijn, De Vrij, Frenkie De Jong.."
"His most recent video is on Kony 2012, and released just yesterday. I’d say it’s a pretty good starting point, but really all of his content is quite accessible and enjoyable."
Depends on whose handwriting it is. If it's mine it'd pretty much ruin the gift.
"Hi, the Acer Swift X on my list is a very cost effective option. Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3050 Ti graphics, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display for $1,099. It should be viable for your uses."
