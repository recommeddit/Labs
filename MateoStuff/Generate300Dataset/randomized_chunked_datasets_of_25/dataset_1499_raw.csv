Cant find it here either just these weird off brands.
I've never seen AI fuck up so similarly to human players in any other game. Wreckfest is really on another level

"I first went to Chico (hated it, my entire high school practically went there and everything was greek) so I transferred to Long Beach and absolutely looooved it. So take advantage of the transfer system if you find one campus just doesn’t feel right for you. :)"

"[From the page about Brita filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brita), it says that they are not meant to truly purfiy water, but to remove the halogen compounds, like chlorine, that cause your tap water to smell and have a bad taste. They also soften your water. Your tap water quality is highly dependent on your municipality and the age/material of your pipes, but due to federal regulations, should always be potable."
"I'm gonna go ahead and give a probably unpopular opinion...

I think PHP is awesome, at the very least for beginners. The platforms required to make a PHP site work are incredibly easy to install. The language itself is very forgiving \(I would even call it fun\) and I wholeheartedly disagree that it encourages developers to become lazy or ""not learn the right way to do things"".

Also if you're thinking about learning the language to use it later, it powers a lot of projects out there and I personally don't think it's going anywhere for now. C#, Java and .NET are popular right now, but trends come and go, I'm sure PHP will regain some popularity eventually.  \<bracing for arguments that C#\-Java\-.NET are powerfully established and THEY're not going anywhere\>

That being said, Java and C# are perfectly good for backend, so maybe you'll want to invest time in HTML, CSS/SASS/LESS, and Javascript before trying something else for the backend."
"My lifetime is keyword. His last 2 seasons were what I remember.  I didn’t get to see Walter in the 70s,early 80s"
"Henry Rollins, totally awesome, totally down to Earth. Can say the same for Iggy Pop. 

Most other musicians I've met have been total dicks."

"Homologation rules in FM7 means you can’t actually “build” a crazy car and go race. 

I remember in Forza 3 or 4... swapping in a Ford 5.0L modular motor (before the coyote engines) into a Ford Focus, making it AWD, and giving it like 1000hp. Good god that car was silly. In forza 7, you swap in some upgraded brake lines and a clutch, you increase class and break homologation rules and can’t run the car. Hell, some cars even need to be downgraded to play. I still haven’t finished the main career because it got so boring I just keep going back to Horizon so I can just fuck around with cars. 

Homologation and class rules are not bad; having them for a few races would be cool but having them for the whole game is dog shit."
"Curious, would you say you could break into supply chain work (with growth opportunity) without the masters? I'm a CPA currently working for a Big 4 firm doing audit, and I'm strongly considering trying to break into more operational roles when I'm done here (probably in a year or so)."
This looks really interesting. Do these stay on pretty well?
Still the top for me!
"so what's worse than most cookie warnings?

California's CCPA law means that every other site pops up not just a cookie warning, but a whole fucking set of dialogs to allow me (annoy me) to set all my cookie preferences."
Does buying the calculator offer any advantage over the free alternatives?
"Of course, I always try to recognize that they're doing all this on their own effort/time and it's by no means a given."

My super cheap Insignia (Best Buy) case has this.

"Not only that, but Source Code is an incredibly underrated film. And it's also done by the same director. Now, I don't technically considered time traveling sense the main characters are still proceeding forward in time and it's more like them reimagining his consciousness before the explosion on the train, but regardless, it's a great film."
There's a reason like 90% of men wear it. It's the best selling cologne in history.
"Huh, wow. This was part of the reason I was considering [`node-libcurl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-libcurl) since dropping out to C is probably worth the data marshaling cost."
