11428,best gifts for dad,"Growing up, I never really knew why, but all my father wanted on Father's Day was to watch the US Open. It always fell on Father's Day.... and my dad just wanted to watch the finish instead we always dragged him out to lunch and what not...

it wasn't until I was older and loved watching golf and realized that the US Open is one of the best of the majors because they consistently make it difficult for the professionals... so now, all I want to do on Father's Day is watch the US Open."
11145,best backpack for college,"I used a backpack through college and graduate school, and got used to having to replace it every year or two.  Now I use a messenger bag from [Timbuk2](http://www.timbuk2.com) instead.  I've had it six years now and carry about 20 lbs in it on my daily commute.  It totally rocks, and comes with a lifetime guarantee."

5415,best home improvement store,"I prefer Home Depot. I have both near me, and *my experience* at the two locations *I go to* (not general opinions of the chains, or saying they're all the same) I find the quality of the products at HD to be superior and the employees to be more friendly and knowledgeable on average. That said, I'll still go to Lowes sometimes. They're both fine stores."

22350,best celebrity,"A few years ago Helen Mirren came to my job. I worked as a weekend hostess at a Ukrainian diner in NYC's the East Village, and very famous for its pierogis. I didn't know who Helen Mirren was at the time, and as it was a busy Saturday brunch, I asked for her name, put it on the wait list and let her know it would be 20 minutes. She just stood off to the side and talked with her two other companions. Never bothered me. Never demanded to be seated sooner. Never brought up her celebrity status. Customers kept coming up and asked if that was THE Helen Mirren. My boss eventually made me seat her before everyone else. Helen looked at her watch and remarked it hadn't been 20 minutes! All in all, Hellen Mirren 10/10 lovely person."

11306,best gifts for dad,"I'm letting my daughter stay with her dad. I grew up without having my dad in my household so I know how important it is for a father to be in their child's life.

61072,Best comedy show on Netflix,I wish Phil and Lem were still on TV.
62174,Best RPG game on PS4,"Ughh, that part sucked so much. Camera was so much more difficult than any enemy encountered in the whole damned zone. And again, the idea of >!having noct alone and without access to his powers was great but the execution was fucking terrible!<. You honestly didn't miss much as I hated everything after that gameplay-wise and was left confused story-wise so good call and giving up."
