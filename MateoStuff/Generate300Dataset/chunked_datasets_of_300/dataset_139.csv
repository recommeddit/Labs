44570,"I misread that as ""used"" and was immediately disgusted."
44571,"Electric teakettle, especially if you’re just starting out in your own place. Super versatile appliance."
44572,It's weird to see this as something different. Electric kettles are the more commonly used kettles in the UK. Not many people use hob kettles any more
44573,"In Australia, too, electric kettles are a basic home appliance. Everyone has one. I saw this comment and was really confused as I regularly forget it's not normal in the US"
44574,Swimming goggles with a prescription degree. It really is life changing after swimming blindly for so many years.
44575,Curved shower curtain rod.
44576,They've got curved shower rods. Curved. Shower rods.
44577,I need to ask you to stop. That... showering... is making people nervous.
44578,Don’t suppose you can enchant my shower? Dull old pipes can barely melt butter.
44580,"A meat thermometer, take all the guess work out of your internal temperatures. No more assuming and possibly eating undercooked meat or eating dried out chicken."
44581,"I will try this, thank you!"
44582,"yes but don't get one of the many shitty offbrand ones on Amazon.. takes forever to register the heat. Go with the Weber. It's ~$10 and is as close to instant as you can get.

Edit: Weber 6750 Instant Read Meat Thermometer"
44583,One of those battery packs to jumpstart your car. I bought one a few years back and keep it in the car. Have used it to not only jump my own car but several other folks in need of help. Also bought one for my son for peace if mind. He also has used his numerous times. It can also charge phones and other small devices.
44584,"A new hobby. Most have super low barriers to entry. I started playing music, my ukelele and kalimba cost me $60 total. I also started making miniatures for d&d, the foam core, paints, amd other bits cost me $20. Find something cool that you've always wanted to try and do it!"
44585,"I got ordained online like 5 1/2 years ago and have since done around 15 weddings. I'm not sure why, but people just started asking me to officiate their weddings and it kind of took off. Not ""life changing"" per se, but it has opened some doors for a side hustle, and i fucking love going to weddings. 

Also it's free"
44586,Everyone already got the good stuff so....a triple AAA membership comes in pretty handy!
44587,How does one join the AAAAAAAAA?
44588,"The All American Association Against Acronym And Abbreviation Abuse Anonymous group is not a group that you join, it's more of a collective of like-minded individuals."
44589,A poop stool for ergonomic shitting. I'm buying one for everyone in my family for Christmas.
44590,So that would be a stool stool?
44593,Where can you get a duck for so cheap? And why ducks? And why two? Genuinely curious
44594,The Park.
44595,"The elite don't want you to know that, but the ducks at the park are free, you can take them home. I have 458 ducks."
44596,A cast iron skillet. It’s a super versatile piece of cookware that if taken care of properly will last a lifetime.
44597,I now have $1200 of purchases I need to make immediately
44598,Box cutter. As a kid I had no idea I'd spend so much of my adult life breaking down boxes for recycling.
44599,"A defensive driving class. Please, some of y'all need to take one."
44600,"Did one in high school cause it gave my mom an insurance break (I was already a good/safe driver, so it wasn't for that). It was a ton of fun. The one in my city used old cop cars so you got to swerve around in a police cruiser for a day."
44601,"Tub Shroom. It’s a rubber plug type thing with holes in it that you put in the tub drain (kind of shaped like a mushroom, hence the name). It catches probably 95% of hair and gunk while still allowing the water to flow down. After your shower, just remove from the drain and pull off the hair (this part can maybe be a little gross, but hey, it’s your hair) and toss in the garbage. 

They’re maybe $15-$20, and will save you heaps of time, money, and frustration by keeping your drain clear."
44602,A Brita ( for all my college students having to drink nasty water)
44603,"[Tongue scraper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064JGBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is my first choice. The gunk I get off my tongue is so satisfying.

Also, any sort of physical fitness stuff. Jump rope, dumbells, wrist rollers, hand grips."
44604,Affordable:  Have you seen the prices that people are selling dumbbells for...  Covid has turned the fitness market into a gouging market..
44605,My grandmother threw out about 500lbs of my grandfather's old olympic plates in March and it made me so sad when I found out. Those wouldve gone for like $1500+ back then.
44606,Your grandma must be ripped
44607,"An iFixIt kit.  It’s $70, but it has the tool for just about any electronic/gadget you need to fix or wanna build.  The amount of stuff I’m able to do with this one organized kit is insane"
44608,Sole inserts for clunky work boots.
44609,Blindfold and ear plugs.
44610,Also recommend some fuzzy handcuffs and a spreader bar.
44611,"an instant pot. completely changed my attitude towards cooking. also, the meals i make are very tasty and last for days. so great investment, saves money, i eat healthier, but still enjoy restaurant quality meals"
44612,a waterfall shower head. Even if your water pressure is on the lower side it works really well and you wont have most of the water dripping down in a big mess while one overzealous stream is stinging you
44613,Windshield wipers. It’s rather annoying when they leave streaks and it’s so nice to turn them on an see a streak free windshield.
44614,"Crockpot/ slow cooker.

I honestly thought it would be another kitchen gadget that I'd never use.  It gets used a couple of times a week. I do my Sunday roast joint in it and the meat falls off the bone.  Great for casseroles/soups /  sauces"
44615,"It’s kinda specific, but a wet pallet does wonders if you do acrylic painting (This includes miniature painting). Also a heat pad or electric blanket is amazing for those cold days/nights."
44616,for some reason i read that as pet wallet
44617,"A really good, sturdy can opener."
44618,Cast iron skillet.
44619,Silicone cooking utensils. Hands down way better than a metal utensil. The scraping power of them is outstanding! Plus I don’t have to worry about scraping the Teflon on the pots and pans
44620,"I have a big ass chef's knife, a Victorinox.  Cost me like $35 at the time, and I'm sure it is still well under $100.  It is a beast.  That became my workhorse, fast."
44621,A Kindle and nice over-ear headphones
44622,a bidet. they are like $30 on amazon
44623,"Full-spectrum lightbulbs, or at least very bright ones. My motivation and energy levels hit rock bottom in winter and faking some extra daylight makes a HUGE difference to my ability to function."
44624,"Better than shit kitchen utensils. Upgrading from Ikea to Oxo is a night and day difference and saves time in meal prep. 

A SAD light...if anything it wakes you up well in the am as you start working. 

Monitor risers, if you don't have height adjustable monitors these help a lot

10ft phone charging cable. 

Over $100:

A good winter jacket changed my shit forever. I bought a top line Helly Hansen winter jack and I now take way more walks no matter the -20 or -30 days. 

A deluxe pillow. They last longer and change your sleep forever."
44625,">Monitor risers, if you don't have height adjustable monitors these help a lot

I use a $700 textbook 🥲"
44626,Currently using a Shakespeare collected edition and The Wise Man's Fear :p
44627,why torture yourself with the constant reminder of the third?
44628,"This comment reminded me, and briefly tortured me."
44629,"I ask myself the every day haha. Come to think of it, it might be why I've slowly stopped using it and just use the shakespeare :p"
44630,"$250 Machine Design textbook for me, at least it's holding its value"
44631,"A Rubbermaid container the exact height needed for zoom calls, when it is not being used for muffins."
44632,Get a 75$ laptop riser and a keyboard and mouse. Night and day.
44633,Came here today a nice Kitchen knife
44634,Yeah might need to go over $100 but a really good chef’s knife is the best/most useful present my wife and I got for our wedding 11 years ago and still gets used everyday
44635,"I picked up a Victorinox 8"" chefs knife on Amazon for about $50 a couple years ago and it's been amazing. Definitely don't need to spend over $100 unless you're really into knives or use them to make a living."
44636,There’s not even a point to owning a cheap can opener... gotta go right for the good ones.
44637,I use my 1970s electric GE can opener I got at a church sale brand new for $5. Love it!
44638,Which pillow?
44639,Also looking for pillow suggestions!
44640,Novaform Sleep Deep Memory Foam Pillow from Costco
44641,"I love my Costco novaform pillow! Got it like 8 years ago and still doing fine. I know you're supposed to change them every couple years or whatever, but I've heard the new versions of the novaform are terrible so I'm hesitant to even try a new one."
44642,[this pillow](https://www.sleepcountry.ca/bio-soy-pillow/product/14BIOSFTPIL) gives me a great sleep every night and I’ve had it for years. Over $100 but they usually have this but one get one free promo on
44643,"I can agree with the jacket, I have had a Canada Goose for over 10 years, upper body never colds in a solid winter jacket. One aspect ill never cheap out again is a winter coat can be well worth $1,000 with the right insulation."
44644,I live in Edmonton and my Canada Goose jacket is worth every penny. I've never felt cold and the quality is great.
44645,i get that they are nice but I'm also never cold in my $200 North Face jacket. Canada Goose jackets are overkill for 99% of the people that buy them and are really just a status symbol
44646,"As someone who had a CG for ten years (and then sold it for $250), I went with a north face and while it's not $1000, the $400 Gotham jacket has kept me warm even when feel like drops below 20 Celsius. From the warmth standpoint, they both perform very closely.

The quality of stitching and the zipper is what could fail on the north face versus CG which uses large sturdy zippers and in ten years I did not have a single rip. Let's not kid ourselves, ones made in Canada and ones made in China.. I'm still a strong believer that products made in North America or Europe are of superior quality. The price difference though I couldn't convince myself to get a CG again, so I'm hoping I'm wrong about north face and that it will last long."
44647,"I'm just saying, I live in middle of nowhere farm land Alberta and I don't know a single person who owns a Canada Goose jacket yet they're all outside working hard no matter the weather. You can get some awesome jackets that are warm AF without dropping $1,000 on the status symbol of Canada Goose. That being said, cheap is cheap. I own one nice branded jacket for city errands and the rest of my stuff is more ""farmer Gucci"", so I look homeless but I don't die when I'm outside in - 40."
44648,"> so I look homeless but I don't die when I'm outside in - 40.

This describes me so perfectly I should tattoo it"
44649,"Exactly this. 

Appropriate layering is cheap and warm. When you work hard and need to cool down to prevent sweating and becoming cold, you can do that.

It might not be a status symbol, but you are warm and your wallet is fat."
44650,"I had a North Face jacket before I bought my Canada Goose and the Canada Goose is noticeably warmer. I don't need to layer like I did with my North Face. 

But I live in Edmonton where it actually gets cold. When I see people walking around Vancouver in a Canada Goose when it's +12, yeah I agree it's just for show and a status symbol."
44651,"Sonicare tooth brush - like getting a cleaning done every time I brush my teeth. Also whitened my smile.

Bidet - I honestly don’t know how people can live without one of these. The rest of the world has these built in

Good skin care routine - started in my late 20s, and wish I started sooner 

A good knife - makes my life much easier. I got a good knife set for under $100 when it was a deep sale 

Performance underwear (Saxx) - much more comfortable, holds my junk in place, and durable. 

High quality bed sheets - I love rubbing my feet on them before I sleep.

I mostly buy all these when they are on a great sale, thanks to redflagdeals"
44652,Could you recommend a good skincare routine that's beginner friendly? I tried using aveno but the cream feels really thick and I don't like it.
44653,Try r/skincareaddiction
44654,"Every skin care routine should include a wash, moisturizer and exfoliate.
Cerave is good and budget conscious, as well as The Ordinary. 
ALWAYS use an SPF in the morning even if it is cloudy. Make sure it is 30+. Mineral sunscreens are preferable as natural and not bad for the Ocean Reefs.
Exfoliate a few times a week, preferably with a chemical exfoliant like Salicylic Acid or Lactic Acid. Physical exfoliants for your skin, like that garbage St. Ives, just damage your skin more than it does do what an exfoliant is supposed to do. Do this only in the evening as it makes your skin more prone to sun damage.

Lots of YouTube videos out there. Check out Hyram"
44655,"I use Cerave and The Ordinary as well!!

- La Roche Posay Face Sunscreen in the morning
- Then at night, clean with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
- Swap between The Ordinary Lactic Acid/The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid/The Ordinary Squalene Oil using each once a week
- Finish with Cerave PM Moisturizer"
44656,"Depends on your skin type, but I personally use Clinique for men oily skin. Face wash 2x a day, and deep scrub 2x a week. Helped with my oily skin big time. I order it online when it’s on sale and it’s decent price for high quality stuff."
44657,Oh my God I even use Clinique.  Now that's creepy. I'm considering switching to rivasol moisturizer tho so... Are you?
44658,After trying so many techniques to clear my skin I finally realized that my skin is super sensitive and can’t handle any rubbing or cleansers. Just a good diet and VERY light cleansing and then complex 15 cream. In hindsight I should have realized this was obvious but I was so sold on cleansing routines for so long I got caught up in the marketing. The cleansers were harsh on my skin and my skin would compensate by producing more oil. After a few rough weeks getting off the cleanser routine my skin calmed right down.
44659,"If you’re interested in trying something, I just started using The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser because of my sensitive skin. It goes on dry and you massage it into an oil then rinse off with water. Very interesting and doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin at all."
44660,"> Sonicare tooth brush - like getting a cleaning done every time I brush my teeth. Also whitened my smile.

Most of them are so expensive when people are better off with the lowest model. No need for Bluetooth or ""smart"" gimmicks. 

Oral-B is even more affordable and the rounded head is easier for plaque removal."
44661,"The only fancy feature you might want is it ""beeping"" every 30 seconds so you evenly brush each quadrant over the 2 minute total brush time, but I'm pretty sure that's on every model now"
44662,Which bidet do you use? Looking at the Luxe Bidet Neo 120 on Amazon but heard it can be hard to install
44663,I recently got the Tushy. It’s a game changer and really sleek design.
44664,I love the Tushy. Just used it while reading this comment.
44665,"I think you might be me, except I'm a girl.  I do buy my partner saxx so our lists really line up.  Also RFD for the win."
44666,Chromecast
44667,"+1, but Chromecast with Google TV is amazing. $70 for regular price."
44668,Menstrual cup
44669,Best decision hands down 🙌
44670,Menstrual cup was truly life changing! Way more convenient and zero waste swap.
44671,29 ladies giving you the thumbs up while the lads on this subreddit stay away lol (am lady myself)
44672,I grew up wearing pads. I once tried using tampon but can never get it in there. Is menstrual cup better you think?
44673,"Were you trying a tampon with an applicator? 

I would recommend getting comfortable with a tampon first before trying a menstrual cup; I've used a cup for 7 years or so and I still find it a bit awkward at times."
44674,You should check out r/menstrualcups
48421,This!
44676,"AMEN. Never going back, this is so easy and comfortable and cheap and eco-friendly and hygienic. I wish I had it growing up."
44677,"Best purchase I've made was a weighted blanket ($70).

No more waking up swimming in sweat. Instead of stacking large and bulky blankets until I feel comfortable enough, I just fold the weighted blanket in half over my torso and fall asleep like a baby."
44678,What brand did you buy? I’m looking to get one too
44679,"Costco has pretty nice ones every now and then. I got an, I think 15lbs one for about $70 from there. Has a nice soft removable cover so you can wash it. Was a good purchase."
44680,Underrated: Metal tongue scraper.
44682,Use a teaspoon
44683,I like Orabrush.

Am I ever going to get $10 worth of toothpaste out of this?  Probably not.  Does it make me happy?  Every time I finish a tube of toothpaste."
44686,"Awesome, this is happiness for a lifetime under $10.."
44687,I use an ikea chip clip / bag clip. Works like a charm on the toothpaste tube. Already had a bunch in the cupboard.
44688,My parents used to have one of these. It was my favourite thing. Didn’t know they still made them :)
44689,3 month membership to E-Harmony (online dating website) in 2010. Met my wife there and never looked back :)
44690,This cost you substantially more than 100.
44691,She has a boyfriend ?
44692,"Carbon steel/cast iron pans. 

Super thin iPhone case. 

Japanese paring knife. 

Merino wool base layers."
44693,Which paring knife? I really like my victorinox 3.5 paring knife which was 8$
44694,"Do you have any recommendations, for a warm merino wool upper base layer or even trousers. I ski often and looking to replace my Uniqlo base layer at the moment."
44695,Icebreaker Merino. You can often find them at 30% off.
44696,The best is almost universally recognized as the Patagonia capilene air. It’s a wool blend with blown fibres that have a hollow core. Very dreamy and warm.
44697,Right now sport check has Helly Hansen merino wool base layers on sale. Mark’s work warehouse has the socks on for half price as well.
44698,"Platinum- Fleece-lined jeans. They make going outside in winter soooo much better.

Gold-good quality paint brushes. The difference between a Dollar Store brush and a $16 Home Depot brush when you are painting a wall is night and day."
44699,"First off, I love these posts. I get some inspiration from them, so thank you for posing your question.

Now for my answer. I got a 5 pack of phone chargers that were 6 and 10 foot long. I liked having so many because then I wouldn't have to compromise and had multiple charging locations throughout my home/ at work. It was like 30 bucks on Amazon, and it has made my life so much better!"
44700,I spent $60-70 on a Bidet attachment for my toilet last July. I haven't used paper since. It's been great and I'll never look back. Both my wife and I use it (no kids) and we now only have to buy paper for guests. I'd say it's worth every penny and will continue to pay for itself.
44701,"Let me add on to this. This was hands down the best buy under 100 dollars for me as well. Also, the hot and cold water makes no difference. I have mine hooked up to just the cold water line. You wash for 10 to 20 seconds max. You will barely feel any chill by the time you are done. So, save yourselves the pain of drawing hot water line and go cold!! I bought mine from home depot here in Canada."
44702,"Put one on about a week ago.. why did I wait so long?  Ordered a Luxe from Amazon.  All 4 of us are happy with it, so I'll be ordering for the other two toilets in the house soon.  As you mentioned, and as most reviews I read said, don't bother with the hot water option.

Remember, the ""cold"" water is going to be room temperature water for most of us.  The water in your lines that's been in the house for hours, is not the cold water entering the house.  None of us have complained about temperature yet.

Installation was easy.  I did have to replace a solid line with a flexible hose.  I \*might\* have been able to bend the solid line enough, but the braided steel lines are so much better anyways, so it was worth it to grab one and install it."
44703,For sure this is great.  We originally purchased one to clean our cloth diapers for our kids but now I use it as a proper bidet attachment.  Work great.
44704,You don’t dry?
44705,"Can you post a link for the Bidet attachment. I have always been interested in one, but never knew you can purchase one for <$100. I know top tear ones can be over $1000. Ill buy one today if it only costs $70"
44706,"[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00OXPZ8WS/ref=ppx\_od\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00OXPZ8WS/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Comes with everything you need for Cold and Hot water. I had to buy a longer Hot Water line as the one provided was too short, but was able to get that at Home Depot."
44707,"Thanks, hopefully ill be trying the bidet out this weekend!"
44708,Costco.ca has some brondel ones. Very easy to instLl
44709,"I have the lowest tier bidet from Costco and it is amazing! It’s just a cold line, but the water needs to run for a while until you get water that is actually cold enough to be uncomfortable."
44710,"Kobo mini e-reader: bought it in 2013 on sales for £30, so I guess around $50. Took me a while to adapt from physical books, but now I read 20-30 books a year and all of them are for free from the digital public library. The size of the reader is very tiny and I can put it in the pocket of my jacket and take it with me when I go out for walks. Also very useful for when I (used to) travel and go to holidays as I can pack a lot of books."
44711,"I never heard of a mini ereader but I have the libra h20. I made the switch last summer and I love it. It was an adjustment but i save so much money. I buy my books of kobo and they are so much cheaper,( I love owning the book and keeping it in the library for life). And plus I can go book shopping lying in bed instead of getting in my car and going to the store."
44712,"I think they discontinued the mini not long after I bought it, which is a pity because I love its size.

I definitely replace going to the bookstore with browsing the digital catalogue of the public library (Vancouver). I can risk reading books that I may not like without waisting money."
44713,"*  Menstrual cup - has probably saved me $100s at this point
* Safety Razor - I can't believe I used to spend $25 on 6 Venus blades that would last like a week when a 100 pack of these blades are better and $5. 
* Heavy duty reusable grocery bags - No need to worry about carrying too much crap and ripping plastic/paper bags, never get charged 5c for bags again
* CBD oil - I have annoying sinus pain now and then, this stuff helps for the times that advil doesn't. Was also great when I pulled a muscle in my back a few wks ago.
* Spotify subscription - So cheap for how much I use it. I know it's not an object but it replaces all the CDs I used to have to buy in the olde times
* Metal pilot pen that fits their refills - These pen refills are magic, I take notes for work every day and send letters to people and this current refill has somehow been going for a year? Basically a never ending pen."

44725,"A corded DeWalt drill, I think I paid $40 almost 20 years ago and I was never particularly careful with it, and I use it all the time around the house or when helping friends. Because it is corded it will not die when batteries are too expensive to replace or discontinued.

And a good soldering station, although under $100 was because it was used. The number of times you can solder something back or replace a cheap component instead of throwing it away, it pays for itself."
44726,"Quality tools in general. Buy once, cry once.

Or, cus I'm still a cheap bastard, or might not know how much I'll use it. Buy a cheap one, and it will either do just fine, or when it breaks or gets thrown off a roof in frustration, you know the good one is worth it,  and what features to look for."
44727,Are you a tradesman? If so cordless tools are a necessity
44728,"No, if I was it would be a completely different story and I would definitely use them enough to justify the cost and use them to their full potential."

44730,"[Leifheit clothes drying rack](https://www.amazon.ca/Leifheit-Varioline-Winged-Clothes-Adjustable/dp/B00MEXLU3C). Saw my sister using one (she lives in EU). She's super picky about her housewares so I figure this one, while pricier than most, is probably gonna be buy for life kinda thing. I used to dry my clothes on hangers on a garment rack. The Leifheit I feel is better for hanging all sorts of things where you don't want that ""hanger bump"" like tees and sweaters. I only use my dryer once a week now, for towels. Everything else gets dried on the LH rack. 

Alterations on blazers, coats or pants done by a tailor. I'm short so it's really hard to find clothes that fit off the rack. So worth the time and money to make those sleeves and pant legs fit properly. 

Athleta work out leggings. Comes in lengths (petites, regular, talls, crops, 7/8, full) so it's easy to find one that works for you. Good fit & quality, customer service. It's a B corp. Lots of the products are made from recycled content. They only ship in the US. In the before times I'd ship to a mailbox just south of our border, and pick up, so save the silly brokerage/customs charges. 

A properly fitted and constructed pair of work out shoes. My current pair is NB Minimus. I don't understand people who work out in Converse or fashion sneakers. 

Good cold weather accessories. Like a good merino beanie. Mine's from MEC. I use a sweater de-piller to freshen it up every now and then. Also Smart Wool gloves. Oh! and wool socks from Darn Tuff. Can't say enough good things about them. Life time guarantee.

Organizers of any kind, for drawers, for the medicine cabinet, closet, pantry, laundry room. Matching within the whole house is hard, as I usually snag sets when on sale, but within one closet or drawer, a set makes it look more $."
44731,It was difficult to take the plunge but I have several DT socks now. No more worrying! Do you use a de-pilling stone or electric?
44732,I haven't had to depill the socks yet but I have a cheapy electric depiller that I use on all my woolens. A fellow DT lover. I blame my SO who's into high quality active/outdoor gear. My first pair of DT was from a liquidation sale so 50% off reg. retail. My subsequent pairs were all full priced.
44733,"Converse actually *are* properly constructed for heavy weightlifting. They have a wide solid base with minimal interference between your feet and the floor - aside from sock feet, which many places don't allow, converse are often the next best option."

44735,"A lot of my favorite purchases were already mentioned but I think it's still worth it to drill the point

* Bidet attachment
* Electric toothbrush
* 10 ft USB Type C cable
* Used headphones on kijiji (got Astro A40 and Audio Technica's)
* Bought a Blue Yeti and Stand off Kijiji for $100"
44736,I'm not very handy. Is the Bidet attachment easy to install?
44737,Took me about 20 mins from box open to working. Trick is to make sure it fits your type of toilet seat and the rest is pretty straightforward.
44738,Yes just unscrewing fittings and screwing the back together in the correct order.

44742,"Not so novelty for teens or pre-teens.  We put some RGB lights in my kid's room, and we have the controller on our phone.  One flash means 1/2 hour warning for dinner, two flashes means it's dinnertime, red means BE QUIET WE ARE TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP."
44744,"Replying to this cause it's related, but a safety razor. It was $12 and came with a pack of 100 blades. I've had it for like 5 years and am not even halfway through the blades.

44745,"This! I’m a dude, my first 100 blades lasted me 4 years of shaving my face year-round. I also use old-style shaving soap. 10$ of soap lasts me 4-5 years. So much better than buying cartridges."
44746,"Some recent ones that come to mind:

- **A good shower head**: Makes a world of difference. 
- **Motion sensing night lights**: Don't step on things at night, don't wake up my partner by turning on the lights
- Honeywell **humidifiers**: Sleep much better
- **Remote case for Apple TV remote**: Protects the device, red colour to make it easy to find, magnetic so I can attack it to side of coffee table
- **Kitchen torch**: Creme brulee away!
- **Waterproof bluetooth speaker**: Attach it to the wall, listen to podcasts and music in the shower.
- **Quality umbrella**: Got tired of buying $15 ones that barely last a season. 
- **Inexpensive souvenirs** from travels: Photos are nice but we love having small things around the house that remind us of the memories we had is priceless."

Basically switching to online grocery for 75% of my shopping has saved me sooo much time. The shopping experience isn’t always perfect but the time it saves me makes up for it. The key is to use it at No Frills so that you don’t have to wait for them to bring it out to your car. 

If you shop even once a week, the free pickup and amount of points you get back more than makes up for the membership fee."

I like carbonated water - it’s about all I drink. High end soda stream from value village was $15, bottles and canisters have paid for themselves a dozen times over.

2) cloth diapers for my 2 month old son. Turns out he hates being wet, and we can easily go through 20 diapers a day. I’m sure we saved hundreds on disposables already.

44765,"It's the $400 kettle, $800 in kegs and CO2 tanks, and multiple fridges that realllly extend the ROI on that one.

The plus side, the more I brew the more I save...... right?"
44766,"Do you really need a separate kettle to homebrew, or is mainly to deal with the volume you're producing?"
44767,"Volume, pretty much.

I'll first clarify since this isn't a brewing sub, ""kettle"" in brewing means a pot, basically. You can absolutely make beer with whatever pot you've got lying around, it's just for heating mash water and boiling the beer with the hops. But a ""typical"" batch size is 5 gallons into the fermentor, which means about 6 gallons before you start boiling, and it foams up so you need space above that. Many people start out with a Canadian Tire turkey fryer pot/propane burner.  I eventually upgraded from that to a 10 gallon kettle from Spike - stainless steel, welded-in ports for valve and thermometer, thick 3 ply bottom. Some people buy 15 or 20 gallon kettles to produce 10 gallons at a time. Above that you're starting to look at professional equipment."

Warm Buddy microwave teddy bear $45 - I have PTSD and it helps me fall asleep. Because the warming beanbag is in a stuffy it doesn't overheat/burn you.

44787,"Noise cancelling headphones (Anker Soundcore Q20 from Amazon for about $70). I am so easily distracted by noise, it blocks out my neighbours using the leafblower for an hour, the central heating noise, mutes conversation so it's less distracting. Has made working from home infinitely better and would be great if I was sharing an office one day too. 

6ft unbreakable phone charger, so I can use my phone while it charges and I don't have to replace the cable every 3 months.

Chromecast ~$30. So easy to stream anything to my tv and I can still use my phone at the same time unlike Apple tv mirroring. I can even load a YouTube video for my cat and then leave the house.

A good pillow, and although it was a little over $100, a memory foam mattress topper. My body stopped hurting.

A fire alarm (free). In most developed countries, you can book your local fire department to come and install a new fire alarm for free.

44832,This!! I work nights and it’s the only thing that could get me to sleep even after melatonin
44833,"A good pillow. Granted, bedding can be unreasonably overpriced, but $20 pillows at Target are not awesome. Invest in a good pillow. You spend 1/3 of your life on it."

44842,"Spending the extra $3 on each wiper really makes a huge difference I didn't think it would, but it do."
44843,PIAA has wiper blades and refills that contain silicone. Found them in the early 2000 and every time someone I know gets a new car I get them some. They leave a little bit of silicone on the windshield and then after a bit the water just beads and rolls off. Best wipers ever
44844,I use rainex wiper fluid. Leaves behind a film that water beads off. Same result and it’s incredible!
44845,Rain-x is a life saver
44846,"Careful with this stuff though. If you don't prepare the windshield properly and apply it properly, it'll show up with nasty streaking which is annoying but especially dangerous driving at night in the rain."
44847,Ohhh...... Is that why my windshield is streaky.
44848,"Same goes for the wax that they use in car washes (the automatic ones anyway). It never works as it should and it always leaves streaks because the windshield is never prepared in advance.

What I mean here by preparing your windshield is that at the very minimum it should be 100% clean, dry and fat-free (preferably smooth as well, i.e. polished). Then apply Rain-X or wax, make sure it has time to cure, then buff it out completely. Add a little bit to your windshield wipers for good measure (these should always be clean anyway, to prevent scratching). This way you never get streaking, you always have crystal clear vision and the Rain-X stuff works like magic. For like a few months, anyway.

Considering the windshield is the part of the car you look at / through 95% of the time, I would think it well worth the effort."
44849,"If you cook regularly, a large wooden chopping block and a decent quality chefs knife. Takes so much effort and time out of food prep in a way that transforms your will and ability to take on more complex recipes. So often I see people trying to prepare food with crappy little blunt knives on those tiny polythene chopping boards that slide around all over the place and I can barely watch."
44851,I came to say 4-5 decent cutting boards. I have some  1/2 inch thick boards that get used daily and have held up for the last 15 years. Cooking is so much better with the right tools.
44852,And as nice as wood is to cut on... plastic can go in the dishwasher. Having options is nice.
44853,"Some plastic ones can lol, I made that mistake once and the only thing it was good for a soft shell taco form after that. So hey still a win for me"
44854,"A decent pair of shoes on clearance. Nice shoes, like Eccos, that are good for your feet. You might not think about it, but your feet and how you treat them are crucial for the health of you ankles, knees, hips and back. You're standing on those mfs all the time. They work hard for you, so get good shoes! 

I'm not talking about designer bullshit or whatever is trendy."
44855,"Construction worker here and can confirm, your feet are your most valuable tool. Treat them well and buy good boots, shoes and socks."
44856,">socks.

This especially. I think most people who work on their feet realize good boots/shoes are worth it, but the socks make a world of difference as well. I don't care if they're $15 for a three pack, they're fucking worth it."
44858,"As a fat footed woman, have you ever tried Brookes sneakers because they changed my fucking life. I have brick shaped feet,  and by that I mean have EEE feet combined with a high foot bone and shallow ankle. Brookes are the only ones that did it.

For dress shoes, legit Crocs. They make more than clogs and my only heels and flats are from there because the default widths there are significantly wider"
44859,"If it wasn't for the fact that I know my mum doesn't have reddit, I'd say this was her lol. Except she likes Asics sneakers. And has a ""slipper crocs (croc with lambs wool lining, a crocasin if you will), yard crocs and going out crocs"" and she has converted me too. 

My fiancee likes to pretend I end at the knees, then she doesn't have to look at my camouflage crocs."
44860,"Almost all shoes are to narrow.

We have almost an entire civilisation where people walk around in shoes that hurt them, or are uncomfortable. Just ask around and you start to realise almost everyone has this problem, some don't even know about it. People even get deformed toes and nail problems and they still don't think their shoes are too narrow.

Just look at sandals, as soon as there is no back support to squeeze our foot into the tips the whole design of the sole has to be changed.

Shoe designers are the first to be lined up when the revolution comes. Some will be spared, but not many."
44861,"I grew up homeschooled, so no one forced me to wear shoes on a daily basis, and my feet resemble those you'd see on some bushman far from civilization. I'm female but wear a men's size 11 (US sizes), and I have a thumb-sized gap between my big toe and second toe, plus visible space between my little toes. I'm a control group to prove that modern shoes absolutely deform our feet."
44862,"Please tell me you're like 5'1"" because i have this really comical imagine in my mind right now"
44863,{**Stares at the floor making sad hobbit sounds**}
44864,"ME TOO 

Not the homeschool part, but I was barefoot a lot of my childhood. I have size 11 shoes and a big gap between my first and second toe! 

I just wear birkenstocks all the time, even with socks. Fuck fashion."
44865,"I can’t agree with this more. I was a CP cast member at WDW and we have to buy our shoes and they have to fit “Disney look”. Most of the oldies had expensive Timberlands that I couldn’t afford as a broke college kid so I bought these cheap boots because I thought that would suffice. Turns out, walking around Disney constantly combined with driving the old Safari trucks (the floorboards would heat up and helped to melt your shoes) meant that the boots I bought barely lasted a month. Ended up calling my parents for money to buy a good set of boots and they last the rest of my program. Don’t underestimate a good pair of work boots. 

Same can be said for character shoes (a type of dance shoe usually preferred by directors and choreographers in theater). A good pair of character shoes can last years and be the difference between being able to walk the next day after a performance or having to soak your feet in Epsom salts to bring down swelling and just general pain."
44866,"Just wait, someone will quote Terry Pratchett for you very soon. Sam Vimes' boot theory is perfect for this."
44868,And airline tickets. Avoid Spirit & Frontier
44869,"Ecco have a huge range of choice so there should be something for everyone.

Also decent insoles can make a world of difference too."
44870,"tbqh, as someone who has been flat broke and homeless before, just a budget mobile phone is quite life changing. not having access to basic modern technology and the information and resources it provides totally cuts people off from almost every aspect of modern society"
44871,Safelink is a program to give free smartphones and plans to the homeless or just poor in general.    All you need to qualify to get one is food stamps.or any other government aid I believe
44872,I had one of these for a good 5+ years. Even when i was paying for a ohkne that one sat In a drawer if anyone in my family needed to take a phone and didn't have one for whatever reason.
44873,Absolutely. Most places require you have internet access to even apply for a job.
44874,dude same. homeless+no phone= public libraries are now your hangout spot
44875,">  homeless+no phone= public libraries are now your hangout spot

My local library was literally the #1 thing that helped me stop being homeless years ago."
44876,"My library always had quite a handful of homeless people either reading or just chilling, never bothered anyone. There was an older homeless man in particular I think about very often, he was always reading or always typing on a computer whenever I'd visit, and once I was looking at the books behind him while he was on a computer and saw that he was printing out and filling job applications. I saw him very constantly for a couple of years, but at some point I just didn't see him again. I hope he was able to get employed and is living a good life now."
44877,"Ladies... get a shower stool. I have a teak Japanese style one.. Shaving is infinitely easier without having to do shower yoga. Also, I no longer almost fall and die while switching legs. And it's easier to dissociate under the water.

Edit: dissociate vs disassociate"
44878,"I’m 1000% with you. I’ve had a chair in my shower for only a couple months and it makes everything easier. I also feel like I can sit in the shower and really REALLY tend to my feet without fear of slipping, falling, and dying lol

Edit: missed a word :)"
44879,"I'm no lady, but bending over to get at my feet is getting harder with time and my in-progress dad bod. I'll be looking into these. Thanks, internet friend!"
44880,"I mean you don't have to be a lady... you can use the stool to sit on while crying in the shower or imagining complex arguments whilst doing the ""The Thinker"" pose."
