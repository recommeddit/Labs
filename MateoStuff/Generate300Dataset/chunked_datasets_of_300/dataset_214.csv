70568,"Depends on where you live a bit, but internet related technologies. So information technology, computer science, networking, etc. A CS grad w a couple decent internships under their belt typically lands a healthy salary in any tech friendly city. Bay area most likely 100k on day 1."
70569,"Thanks, I have been looking into a CS degree but am worried because there seems to be a lot of high level math involved, unless I'm wrong. Do you think perhaps a computer information technology degree would be easier but just as beneficial to me?"
70570,"There are zillions of online resources for this that will give you good exposure to various technologies, from 101 and advanced. Spend some time w some basic tutorials, get a feel for what might interest you, then dig deeper. 

In the end, you're going to have to work hard, there are no shortcuts, only better routes. No one is a natural and just nails math, or anything else, they work at it. Get some late night focus sessions going, make it important to you, find your growth mindset. It's all up to you, no one else is going to make it happen. Want your 6 figures? Go get 'em."
70571,"That seriously motivated me a lot more, I might just do it. Thanks man"
70572,"CS major about to graduate here. Math and science needed in the major are the basics (up to calc 3 and electricty/magnetism/1 chem class). Any other math you do is specifically tailored for the major (numerical methods, algorithms, lambda calculus) and that's the extent of those subjects I've had to deal with. Each university is different but I feel it shouldn't stray too far from this."
70573,Thanks for your input. Unfortunately I barely passed algebra 2 so I doubt it is for me :(
70574,Systems administrator 🔥
70575,Thanks dude
70576,"I mean, depends on what you consider ""soon"" after graduating and what you consider ""too many years"" in school. It depends greatly on the area and cost of living, too. I have several friends who are accountants who bank six figures and graduated in 2014. However, they work in public accounting, which is very hectic work schedules for about a third of the year and are great at what they do in big firms.

Then again, you need 150 hours to qualify to sit for the CPA exams, which public accounting will probably require to hire you, so...again, depends on your expectations."
70577,Within 5 years or so would be nice. As for school...the most I wanna spend in college is 8
70578,"They do offer 5-years Masters programs at some schools, so you can get your bachelor's and Masters degree in Accounting within 5 years. But then you'll have to study for the CPA exam after that for up to a year while working, so it's up to you. Depending on your state, too, they may count some of your upper level psychology credits towards the 150 limit (that's what they're doing for me with my old biology credits since I used to be a biology major, now accounting major)."
70579,I don't mind that kind of timeline but the bottom line is accounting is pretty math heavy isn't it? I could be wrong though
70580,"Nah, speaking as a senior accounting student, it's just addition/subtraction, basic algebra stuff. The harder part of accounting is remembering all the rules and exceptions."
70581,No way. Wasn't expecting that at all. My school offers accounting with concentrations in either information systems or professional accountancy. What do you think is better?
70582,"Professional accountancy is a weird term; I'm guessing that means they maybe focus on more accounting electives so you have enough accounting credits to sit for the CPA exams. Information systems is really hot in the accounting world because a lot of accounting majors also perform IT audits. I would just speak to an adviser and research the requirements of the CPA exam for your specific state (every state is different unfortunately). 

Yeah, math is a big misconception for accounting. We did have to complete business calculus and a couple stats classes, though, but after that, smooth sailing lmao"
70583,"So I think a lot of good suggestions here. If you have good people skills, then sales is probably a decent way. 

If you have enough grit and you’re willing to put in the effort, you can get good at math and go through engineering school. If you’re not interested in engineering, then don’t do it. You will be disappointed. 

If you don’t care about the type of work and just willing to bust your ass, get into accounting or finance. Can easily make 6 figures there. But again, this is number heavy (maybe not calculus heavy)

If you don’t want to learn math and don’t mind working with your hands, you can go to welding school for 2 years and come out making 6 figures. This is one of the highest ROI’s due to low cost. (Student debt is expensive). 

There are also hospital tech jobs such as radiology technicians who make bank after 2 year training. And that’s a seriously recession-proof job. 

I donno, it’s not really that hard, but it might not sound like a dream job or be what you’re interested in. No matter what, you will need some schooling, you will need to work hard."
70584,"All good suggestions, thank you"
70585,I’m a nurse started at 80 k out of 2 year community college. It’s under grad. The math is basic algebra and the science went up to micro biology. Harder sciences but not that hard
70605,Counter: what are some of the least popular majors?
70606,BS Gerontology
70607,Classics
70608,The whole undergraduate archaeology program (majors and minors) has about 35 students in it so…
70609,"Have you ever heard of Non-governmental organizations and Social Change? Me neither, up until I met someone literally last week with that major"
70610,Global Studies has about 50 people. Also Comedy (in SDA)  apparently has like 1 person.
70611,As a comedy person I can confirm we have 4 people.
70612,Geology/ earth sciences (technically two separate majors) have like 20 undergrads total
70613,"Perhaps linguistics. When I was a student, we had about 70 students in the entire department. My specific major (computational linguistics) had about 6 or 7 students. I was the only comp ling major the year I graduated and even other graduating linguistics students had no idea what my major was. Somebody even looked at my sash and thought my major was called ""confrontational linguistics"". Pre-pandemic, I believe the department wanted to do a little series called ling-what-stics as a lot of people seem to have no idea what linguistics is and assume it means we all speak like 10 languages."
70614,Ling is so cool! I took an intro class a loved it (even though it took a lot of effort). Can I ask what you do with a comp ling degree?
70615,"The intro class here at USC was very hard. It had me questioning my major. A lot of comp ling people go into natural language processing or speech technology/recognition type work. Just about all of those positions require at least a graduate degree in computational linguistics though, so that's why grad school at UW was the next step for me. We had a guest lecturer in USC's LING 285 and apparently she worked at Disney doing some kind of sentiment analysis job, so I guess we can wind up just about anywhere tasks need to be performed on language. I personally would want to work at like Amazon (Alexa stuff). I am finishing up my thesis project over the summer, so fingers crossed I land somewhere cool. I'm so done with school for the time being, haha."
70616,"That sounds really cool! Congrats, and good luck on your thesis :)"
70617,Chem and physics lol. Jk I'm trolling
70618,"Business, a lot of people may be in it but they are all hated"
70619,"Dornsife posted on their instagram story a few months back that the top 5 most popular Dornsife majors are Economics, Psychology, Human Biology, Political Science,  and Biological Sciences. Don't know about the rest of the school though."
70620,"Here I can even provide a top 10 list:

1. Business Administration   
2. Computer Science   
3. Economics   
4. Computer Science Business Administration   
5. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Studies   
6. Biological Sciences   
7. Communication   
8. Applied and Computational Mathematics  
9. Psychology   
10. Electrical and Computer Engineering  
  
This list is just based on my opinions and observations, there are most certainly subtle differences to what they really are, but I'd say most of them on the list are accurate."
70621,"I’m pretty sure  Economics is the most common major at USC. I’d probably guess that HPDP isn’t that common, and replace it with either Human Bio or Political Science from my personal experience. Otherwise I agree with this list"
70622,Computer Science is probably one of the most popular majors in any college these days.
70623,I see way more Human Bio than Biological Sciences people.
70624,"*Psycho*

It starts out being about a woman on the run with a suitcase full of money and then turns into *a completely different movie* a third of the way in."
70625,From Dusk till Dawn is another left turn out of no where.
70626,"I was so fucking confused by this one, I went in thinking one thing and it was SO different."
70627,"3/4ths of the movie it’s a family getting their vacation hijacked, the last 1/4...well, don’t wanna ruin it if someone takes this recommendation."
70628,It seems like the granddaddy film for shocking twists like this  - can't think of an earlier one off the top of my head.
70629,"They kill the ‘main character’, it was completely unheard of at the time. She’s kind of just a vehicle for the plot to get to the real main character."
70630,That's not really the primary twist.
70631,This is the correct answer!  Please upvote this to the top.
70632,There's no correct answer. There's a variety of answers.
70633,Wrong. It's Moon.
70634,I haven't seen the movie.  What does it turn into?
70635,You could just watch one of the greatest films of all time. Something which changed the genre and art form itself ever since. Or we could explain it to you? Up to you.
70636,Not to give too much away but it starts as a crime thriller and then takes a hard turn into something completely else.
70637,Still the top for me!
70638,The game. Had me constantly guessing till the end. Now I'm devastated I know what happens so I can't be surprised again.
70639,"Even if I know what's coming, the final ""stage"" of the twist never fails to be hilarious"
70640,"I’ve always heard about the twist in the movie so I was super curious when I watched it. When it came, I was so surprised and WTF’d that I still don’t know how to feel about it"
70641,"I agree. I went from extremely tense, to extremely confused, to extremely funny in such a short span of seconds. The rest of the film was, as with the entire re-watching experience, never to be intense again."
70642,"Oldboy

The Secret in Their Eyes 

Mother (2009) 

Moon"
70643,Up vote for Moon. Highly underrated.
70645,An older meme but it checks out
70646,Moon is a must see for every moviefanatic
70647,For anyone who likes movies. Great film.
70648,/r/moviescirclejerk
70649,"Oldboy is one of my favorites, but a lot of people I recommend it to just don’t understand it or are a little disturbed by the recommendation. They don’t understand that it’s suppose to make you hate the villain, not the movie. Yes it’s sick and twisted, but it was all orchestrated by a man."
70650,I just watched Oldboy. Oh my good I didn't see that one coming ^^
70651,Nothing can prepare you for the second half of Sorry To Bother You
70652,"Not to beat a dead horse, but def the hardest left turn I’ve ever seen in a movie."
70653,Okay this is gonna make me seen the movie now damn
70654,You most certainly not gonna referent that one tbh. Amazing film
70655,Iunderstoodthatreference.gif
70656,"Did the movie really have a plot twist though? From what I remember, it just went really really off the rails in a huge ""wtf"" way for the entire last act lol"
70657,"Yes, I would call it a plot twist. It wasn't an ""everything you thought you knew is wrong"" kind of plot twist, but it was a plot twist"
70658,"Ok, I am really intrigued now !"
70659,I expect a follow up
70660,"Okay I just watched it... I was getting some black mirror / get out / mr robot vibes but I really could not guess what the fuck was about to happen. Ahah I really don't know if there is something to understand about this movie, like a third or a fourth layer or something... But I liked it, it was entertaining to say the least ! Not your casual monday movie ahah"
70661,"this is legitimately the weirdest movie i have ever seen, pretty sure i enjoyed it, not entirely positive due to weirdness"
70662,That’s exactly how I felt. I felt like I was having a fever dream the entire time and it just felt so incredibly weird that I’m not actually sure if I enjoyed it or not (I think I did..?)
70663,RemindMe! 24 hours
70664,Shutter Island is definitely what you are looking for.
70665,Especially helps if you have zero expectations.
70666,"Unfortunately they literally marketed the movie as having ""THE BIGGEST TWIST IN YEARS"" and it wasn't hard to see coming from literally the first scene if you were expecting it."
70667,That’s interesting. I heard nothing about the movie when I watched it so my mind was blown when the reveal happened!
70668,"The prestige has one of my favourite twists.

Also Donnie Darko has like 3-4 different twists"
70669,Donnie Darko is the exact exemple of a movie I watched while expecting twists and it kinda ruined it for me. Still enjoyed it though but need a rewatch.
70670,"I watched Fight Club and Donnie Darko on the same night, both for the first time. I think I stayed up all night reading theories/plot explanations"
70671,"I loved the plot twist in The Prestige so much, I saw it in theaters three times. Any time I see it on TV I need to watch it, and it is easily one of my top 10 favorite movies. WAY better than the illusionist, IMO."
70672,"I watched the prestige for the first time at college during finals week with a group of people. We finished the movie, I looked at everyone and said “I’m going to start it over from the beginning if that’s okay with everyone.” And we immediately rewatched it"
70673,The Prestige is amazing...I'm still arguing with the people I watched it with about >!(what we think actually happened in)!< the ending though
70674,"what do you mean? i'm not sure there's really an argument.

is there?"
70675,"It's a bit of a stretch and I haven't recently re-watched but basically:

>!You never actually see the cloning machine work. The argument is that he killed off his look alike for real the time he noticed the other guy in the crowd, and everything else is misdirection. You see the multiple hats (something not hard to get a lot of) but never the machine actually working in the same shot. Basically the cloning machine is an extension of the 'light show' of the machine from earlier in the film (lots of fancy effects and then have someone walk out of a different room having been ""teleported""). Plus the flashback shown in the last confrontation isn't set up as a regular flashback, but rather a retelling from an unreliable narrator. And in that hallway you only ever see the one dead man in the tank, when it would have been trivial to show the 'others' to remove doubt.!<

>!In a movie that's explicitly telling you to not fall for the trick and be critical of what's presented to you, it all feels a little suspicious; especially with how they're deliberately not showing you things that would make it absolutely clear. Do you believe the final trick is a literal 1:1 with the birds shown earlier, or that the final trick is being pulled on the audience? (I don't remember exact scenes, but at the time these both made about equal thematic sense)!<

>!And while in the book cloning is actually 100% shown to work, the movie never takes it that far while having a much more grounded story for the first 99% of the run time.!<

>!Basically the whole thing is just that a Nolan movie has an arguably open ended conclusion (\*shocker\*)!<"
70676,This is the most retarded fan theory I have ever read.
70677,"You see not only multiple hats, but multiple Angiers. It’s the closing shot, even, I think — rows and rows of dead angiers in glass cages. 

That’s also why they hired the blind men to clean the place. 

Anyhow I think the cloning wasn’t a “maybe” type of thing.

The spinning top in inception being, of course, an entirely different matter.."
70678,">!No that's the thing, you see covered glass cages that would have been used as the bait but you only ever see the one ""Angier"" during the close up (final shot).!<

>!The theory is based much more on what's not shown rather than what is. That's why it's a bit of a stretch.!<"
70679,"I’m all for fan theories, but this one is just not seeming like it could be true in any way."
70680,"> The theory is based much more on what's not shown rather than what is. That's why it's a bit of a stretch

This theory is downright stupid lol.

He had no way of predicting Borden would be in attendance that particular night to kill the actual stand in."
70681,The Prestige!! My favorite work from Nolan tbh. Highly underrated. The twist was crafted so well. Didn't expect it at all. What a ride!
70682,"""[2001] The Others"" was my first, loved it"
70683,I didnt love the film but the twist was great.
70684,Not many people seem to remember that Movie. LOVED it!
70685,French teacher played that for us in class back in high school. We all loved it for everything it was.
70686,Source Code had a pretty killer twist.
72075,Primal Fear
70688,"Usual Suspects. 

Villeneuve movies are worth looking into, I won't say which ones since they're all worth watching, but there's some definitely unexpected twists in his movies."
70689,I think my jaw actually dropped when I saw the twist in Usual Suspects. There are so many clues but I didn’t put it all together until it happened. So well done.
70690,Good shout for usual suspects
70691,"""Arrival"" has a very good plot twist for having a first-contact premise it covers a lot of emotions and real life scenarios."
70692,"such a good movie. I love the art-style of the movie and the actors ar so good. 

i was so deep in the movie and the story, the twist hit me hart and i could almost hear my brain makes click :D"
70694,"I absolutely loved that film. Best thing I've seen in years.

Everything is set up beautifully."
70695,Watched this the other night and agree. Also sexy as hell so that's a win/win.
70696,The original book (*Fingersmith* by Sarah Waters) had even more twists.
70697,That movie was the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme folded into itself twice.
70698,and tongue twists too
70699,I loved how [Coherence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360) (2013) played out.
70700,"Watch this film without reading ANYTHING about it.

Then after you've watched it go read literally EVERYTHING you can about it. The stories behind the production make that film even better."
70701,That's one you start watching again immediately because there's stuff right from the start to be noticing with a new perspective.
70702,"Can't believe ""Sixth Sense"" hasn't been mentioned yet!"
70703,Who knew the guy in the hairpiece was Bruce Willis the whole time?
70704,This was culturally massive at the time. Absolutely everyone was talking about it!
70705,which sucked if you didn't watch it right away like me. the twist was parodied so much you couldn't avoid it.
70706,Couldn’t make that movie now - internet/social media would have ruined it.
70707,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""massive,"" but the Dutch/French film The Vanishing has a pretty satisfying twist in it."
70708,Amazing film. Just stay away from the American remake.
70709,"one of the great endings. simple and massively effective. and of course, completely predictable yet inevitable for the protagonist."
70710,Don't really see what the 'twist' is in that one.
70711,"Oh yeah, great goddamn film."
70712,Everyone suggesting classic thrillers and there's me thinking my favourite twist will always be in Crazy Stupid Love. Who expects a twist in a rom com and it starts one of my favourite scenes.
70713,"Is it really a ""twist"" than it is a funny crossover?"
71753,Crying Game
70716,Go fuck yourself
70717,better not watch Dark then
70718,This movie has so many twists that it twists itself into an infinite loop.
71141,Arlington Road
70720,"> Arlington Road

Tim Robbins plays a great villain. His character really makes me judge my new neighbors."
70721,"Fight club. It is pretty well known now, but it caught me COMPLETELY off guard. And was masterful."
70722,"I started reading Roger Ebert's review of Fight Club the day I went to see it in theatre. I noticed that Edward Norton's character was simply called ""Narrator"", which struck me as weird (English Lit major), and thus during the film I kept trying to figure out what his actual name was. I figured out the twist, but only a few moments before it was revealed."
70723,Honestly the movie Us directed by Jordan Peele is one hell of a movie with a twist
70724,For me the biggest twist is when they go to the friends house
70725,Damn right
70726,I really adore Us - it might still be my favorite movie of the year - but I saw the twist coming from miles away. It still raises a lot of interesting questions and it's a very compelling plot point but it wasn't very surprising.
70727,That’s why the twist shouldn’t have been revealed. I think the movie would have been better open ended
70728,"The Girl on the Train (2016)

Gone Girl (2014)"
70729,"The twists were better in the books, but the movies built up the suspense well"
70730,"The clock reaches 6:00, ending the time limit. >!Zep and Alison fight over a gun while Det. Tapp rushes to save her. The fight turns into a chase as Det. Tapp tries to catch Zep before he can get to the room. Believing that his wife and daughter are still in danger, Gordon finally saws off his own foot thinking that it is the only way to save his family, while Adam cries out unsuccessfully, trying to tell Dr. Gordon to stop.!<

>!Det. Tapp nearly emerges victorious, but is shot by Zep, who rushes to the washroom and leaves him to die. Free of his shackle after sawing off his foot, Gordon shoots Adam. Very soon after, Zep reaches the washroom and is tackled by Adam, who is injured but still alive and beats Zep to death with the toilet lid. After a tearful goodbye, Gordon leaves, saying he has to get help, or he'll bleed to death.!<

>!Adam, however, is still shackled to the wall. He searches Zep’s pockets for a key,!< >!but instead finds another cassette. Zep was manipulated by Jigsaw all along. He was being forced to kidnap Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter, or be killed by a poison coursing through his system.!<

John rises up and tells him the key to his chains is in the bathtub, but had been swept away when Adam first awoke. John has been making people kill themselves to make them learn life lessons, as he himself is bitter from his approaching death from an inoperable brain tumor. Adam is shocked by the moment and John abandons him, turning off the lights and locking him in the room. “Game over,” he says, ending the film with Adam trapped in the pitch-black washroom, screaming into the credits.!<

&#x200B;

SAW (2004) - A James Wan Classic & my personal favorite plot twist in a movie."
70731,"It never worked for me, partly because I didn't believe they wouldn't realise the dead body wasn't dead over so many hours. Also because the way the black guy (Zep?) was menacing the wife and child with a gun went beyond anything he was forced to do, so the film was a bait and switch for me.

I preferred the later films. For example, Saw II:  >!the footage we thought was live was actually recorded days earlier!<."
70732,"Zep was the guy from Lost and Person of Interest watching over them from behind the glass,  not the black guy ( Danny Glover)"
70733,"I’m a HUGE mystery/thriller/suspense fanatic and I hear the first Saw actually wasn’t that bad. I was able to resist it at first, but i’m starting to really feel like I should check it out. Does it REALLY not have a lot of gore, torture and people cuttung themselves. I KNOW there is one scene that deals with cutting a foot, but for someone who has never seen a torture porn and has no desire too, is this film too much? I would say the most violent film i’ve seen is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and I was easily able to handle that. How does this one compare?"
70734,"The Perfection. It's a new Netflix movie and you should go in knowing nothing. Read the log line if you want, but don't watch the trailer."
70735,I loved every crazy minute of that movie.
70736,"Hoooooooo leeeeeeee shit.  Best fucking suggestion I ever took a leap of faith on ever.  DO NOT watch the trailer, just watch the film.  It is.....a ride.  >!I feel like this film is the perfect nonlinear sequel to Sucker Punch!<"
70737,I thought the twist in Memento was good. Such a unique film. I cant think of anything else quite like it.
70738,You should definitely check out Dark on Netflix.
70739,Surprised there's no mention of the original Saw in here tbh.
70740,"The first Saw movie is utterly incredible, and unfortunately got overshadowed by the quick decline in its sequels' quality."
70741,The third one was really clutch imo. Fourth onward definitely lost its jazz.
70742,"the first Saw was shocking, and it was pre social media still so no one knew about it.  The series was ok until like the 4th or 5th one when everyone else was doing torture porn"
70743,"The twist in the second is sort of interesting, but not nearly as much as the first. On the other hand the second film is where we first get to really meet Jigsaw, and Tobin Bell fucking slays that role, even in the subsequent films where he's really the only competent part anymore."
70744,"Ah yeah, that was a really good one!"
70745,The life of David Gale
70746,Mother from Bong Joon-ho
70747,Awesome movie !
70748,"The Village was probably the most ""out of left field"" twist I can remember. That twist could have literally been anything -"
70749,"Unfortunately while the twist is fairly interesting, this is around when M.Knight started focusing on that more than the actual film. The rest of the movie is really forgettable and even annoying in how forcefully we are shown that this town is ""totally actually in colonial times guys."""
70750,"White Bird in a Blizzard, Gone Girl and Orphan got me as far as modern plot twists go.
Love movies that screw with the head - the best!"
70751,"Old Boy is one of those movies. Watched it about 10 years ago for the first time, still gets me everytime I show that movie to someone."
70752,"It's one of those movies that completely blew me away the first time I watched it, but simultaneously also made me never want to watch it again. The twist is just so fucked up lol. I haven't watched it since I first saw it six years ago, maybe I should revisit it sometime."
70753,"I must say I was afraid to watch it again but it worked out great, the plot is not the only good thing about the movie. I loved the emotions, the action and also some of the funny moments. I will definitely watch it again in a few years."

Oh yeah, I liked the idea but I found the storytelling really bad. Like they could have sold it much better !"

there quite more, but for now, that´s all i remember."

70761,"thanks for the advice, have never heard of those"

70769,"I'll get destroyed but, The Matrix. The advertising campaign leading up to that movie was unprecedented. Even today. The biggest mouth would not tell you what the matrix was. You had to see it for yourself."
70770,"The Guilty is a movie I’d definitely recommend if you like plot twists. Won’t say anymore than that, plus it’s just an overall great film."
71122,Angel Heart
71094,Sleepaway Camp
70773,"Oh man, I watched Sleepaway Camp for the first time during last years Joe Bob Briggs Last Drive In Marathon.  I had no clue what it was about and spent most the movie wondering why I was watching an even campier Friday The 13th.  AND THEN THE ENDING HAPPENED, and it shook me for days."
70774,The ending of The Mist.
70775,"Fight Club, Primal Fear, The others, Sixth Sense"
70776,Nothing will ever top 13 year old me in 2003 watching fight club for the first time when my friends mom rented it at blockbuster for us.
70777,"Jacob's Ladder

&#x200B;

Cautiously optimistic about the remake, too.  :)"
70778,Can't go wrong with most of Villeneuve's work but I just watched *Incendies* and yeah. It's a good one.
70779,That broke me.
70780,*Us* and *Get Out*
70781,"Get Out wasn't really a twist. That was a bulk of the plot.

Us is a solid one for recent movies."
70782,"Red Lights (2012) is a pretty shit movie but  my god the twist commes out of nowhere.

If you watch it for a second time you can spot the hints but i garantie you won't guesse the twist when you first watch it."
70783,High Tension and Diabolique...both blindsided me.
70784,Try [Heist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAKwrYxHhfY) with Gene Hackman. The movie has to many twists that you'll get tired at the end. It also has fantastic dialogue.
70785,"Dark City, Planet of the Apes, Diabolique, The Double Hour, Cabin the Woods"
70786,The Sixth Sense. Easy.
70787,"If you don't mind an anime film, Your Name's twist is pretty good."
70788,"Let the Right One In

It had a great, subtle twist that if you miss it results in a still decent film.  But if caught really changes the weight of entire story.  Was totally left out of the American remake."
70789,"> subtle twist that if you miss it results in a still decent film

was it the her being a boy?"
70790,"Didn't want to spoil but yes.

Changed the whole movie IMO - from a question to a definite answer.  Most other movies they would blatantly have said character make a dastardly smile over a shoulder or something to tell the audience how really they were bad.  I liked how this film didn't force feed it, hell, it barely let you know.  That and the changes the twist makes to the story are small yet definite."
70791,More of a twist ending than a plot twist but I will always love The Mist for how it ended despite how average it was.
70792,*Lone Star* (1996)
70793,Children of Men has a major plot twist and a shocking death
70794,"Incoherence,

Skeleton Key,

Saw."
70795,Identity (2003) for me. My 13-year-old mind was not prepared for that ending.
70796,"you look for Mindfuck movies

here a great list:

https://trakt.tv/users/oya-kesh/lists/collection-mindfuck?sort=popularity,asc"
70797,I’m recommending this on everything because I watched it a day ago and I loved it so much that I literally can’t shut the fuck up about it. Check out Arlington Road
70798,The 2016 presidential election.
70799,Hide and Seek (2005) got me pretty suprised
70800,"Festen.

Also, as a TV series I have found Dead To Me really well plotted, and able to find multiple surprise endings throughout the series."
70801,The Salton Sea has a pretty good twist.  Plus Vincent Dinofrio putting people’s dongs in a badger cage
70802,The Brazilian film Good Manners has a pretty wild halfway twist that blew me away the first time I saw it. Really one if the few movies where there's actually a lot to gain by going in blind
70803,Stonehearst Asylum
70804,"Since the trailer for the remake just came out, how about 1990s Jacob's Ladder? 

Avoid all spoilers for that one, go in as blind as possible."
70805,The Ninth Configuration (1980) deserves a mention.
70806,The Spanish Prisoner. Didn't see that coming.
70807,"From Dusk to Dawn is a pretty big plot twist, as in the plot completely changes into a new movie halfway through."
70808,House of Games (1987)
70809,"This may be an off hand suggestion buy *the girl with the dragon tattoo* has a bit if a twist to it (the 2011 version directed by David Fincher but the Swedish versions as well since they strayed from the books). 

Imagine being hired by a man to find out a killed his niece only to find out...... *spoilers ahead*










That she wasn't dead in the first place but managed to escape the killer"
70810,"Get Out. You had a bad feeling, but you convince yourself that it can't be. Then, when Rose reveals herself to be the ultimate villain and baited Chris to his death, we felt the disgust and betrayed. Then the second twist, when Chris sees the cop car and we think it's the police, only for it to be his friend--- the twist was great."
70811,"Most the theater saw Rose as the villain right away.

The original ending was a very grim one for Chris.

It was going to be a Sheriff and he was going to shoot Chris while he was strangling Rose."
70812,"I knew Rose was the villain too, but I wanted a subversion. I wanted a light at the end of the tunnel, but what we got was worse."
70813,"The movie has great horror elements. But Peele's writing and tone capture leaves a lot to be desired.

Which greatly improved in Us."
70963,Titanic
70815,Gone Baby Gone
70816,Prisoners.
70817,"For me the only thing that beats Slevin is Oldboy.

Unbreakable and Sixth Sense is up there too.

Fight Club knocked me off the chair."
70818,"The best part about discovering a movie with a twist is not knowing it has a twist, tho."
70819,Yeah I feel like telling someone a movie has a twist kinda ruins it.
70820,"This! And then you’re like “that was the twist?! that’s so dumb” because you were expecting something crazy. I was doing what OP is trying to do earlier this year, went through a bunch of twist movies and I didn’t enjoy any of the twist because of my pre knowledge of a possible one"
70822,"Yes, This one"
70823,"Waking Life

A Scanner Darkly

Requiem for a Dream

Mr. Nobody 

Pulp Fiction

The Wall 

Enter the Void 

Irreversible

Mulholland Drive 

Memento

Slacker

Black Mirror 

Electric Dreams 

Altered Carbon

Maniac

Twin Peaks"
70824,"I saw The Wall! Apparently it didn’t do very well at box office, and is underrated as per me. A great watch! 
Plus, thanks for compiling the list!"
70825,"No problem, man. Cheers!"
70826,The German movie?
70827,How does requiem for a dream have a twist ending? I disagree
70828,Coherence (2013). It’s a fantastic story with what you’re looking for.
70829,Awesome recommendation. For some reason this movie is more unsettling than many horror movies.
70830,"so glad to find this here, was about to recommend it. quite impressive for a low-budget film."
70831,"So damn good, does so much with so little. Wish the director had upcoming projects."
70833,Christopher Nolan’s second best movie after Inception imho
70834,This is the ultimate mind fuck
70835,Or was it?
70836,"Total Mind Fucks:

Mulholland Drive
 
Memento

———————————————————————

Plot Twists But You Might See Them Coming: 

Primal Fear

Fight Club"
70837,Great to see some love for Mulholland Drive. David Lynch is a fucking genius.
70838,"Yea Eraserhead could go on the list, and for tv shows Twin Peaks for sure. I also forgot to mention Synecdoche, New York for some of that Charlie Kaufman love."
70839,"I must not have watched enough of Twin Peaks, but the several seasons I watched seemed pretty droll."
70840,There's only 3 seasons if you count the return so you can't have watched anywhere near several.
70841,The new season is fucky. Basically ditches all the soap operay stuff of the other seasons and focuses on the crazy Lynch stuff.
70842,Lol. That movie did not turn out to be about what I thought it would be about...
70843,Primal Fear caught me completely off guard.
70844,"Dark on Netflix is a huge mind fuck of a show, it’s about time travel and multiverses and how no matter what you do to change the past everything is already predetermined"
70845,"Excellent show. I can't even comprehend how detailed of a diagram the writers had to draw for themselves just to be able to figure out how to tell a story like this.

I do have to say, though, that your comment includes some *massive* spoilers that will *completely* ruin this show for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, since it includes a non-obvious description of events that is revealed in the final 60 seconds of the last episode of the most recent season (and knowing about it upfront completely undercuts the drama!!). You may want to edit your comment to make your summary more vague."
70846,Please remove this or cut down on the spoilers. It isn’t fair to someone who hasn’t seen this great series. Wouldn’t want to ruin it for anyone.
70847,Looper
70848,The mindfuck is that people believed that was a good movie
70850,The village
70851,I freaking love that movie. The score was amazing.
70852,"Oldboy (original, not the remake)

Predestination

Arrival"
70853,I second Predestination
70854,"The most incredible bit about ""Predestination"" is that it's such a faithful adaptation of the original short story, even though the original story was nothing more than one scene consisting of characters having a conversation in a bar."
70855,Awhile ago I saw an insane chart on reddit trying to explain what the fuck was happening.
70856,I'll second Oldboy ( the Korean version) an all time great film for me.
70857,"whenever I hear someone say ""go fuck yourself"" I always think of Predestination"
70858,Black Mirror.  Netflix.
70859,"Jacob's Ladder.  (Original, not the remake)

El Topo.  

Perfect Blue.  (Japanese anime.)"
70860,Chinatown (1974) -- plot
70861,"The biggest mindfuck I enjoyed this year was from the Swedish film Border. It might be a bit different from what you’re asking, but you’ll definitely have some good “holy shit what the fuck is happening right now” moments."
70862,Best sex scene in movie history
70863,Most definitely!
70864,"Must be on pornhub by now. That’s for the suggestion.

Edit: can’t find"
70865,"Upstream color
Triangle
Compliance"
70866,"Arrival, Predestination, Memento. I think Memento is the best one out of the three for a nice fucking of the mind."
70867,"It's so gentle and charming when it does it, though"
70868,"Repo men.

A Scanner Darkly. 

Shutter Island.

Identity

Donnie darko.

Blade runner (in the book).

The Ring

Shrooms (not good, just qualifies)

The Ninth Gate

The Others

We are still Here"
70869,"I know it's been mentioned but Memento is great.

Vanilla sky is good as well. Haven't seen the spanish original.

Wild things has several plot twists.

Old Boy (korean) is definitely a mindfuck."
70870,Primer. Some engineers build a machine & things get...weird. Same guy that made Upstream Color.
70871,Loved that movie I liked it more than Upstream Color something about the dialogue makes it so real. Plus to see some engineers make a time machine by accident and it’s not some chrome cover aesthetically pleasing machine made it very realistic.
70872,Side Effects
70873,"Check out 'The Departed' came out in the mid 2000s I'd say 2006 or so. It's got Leonardo DiCaprio (One of his best performances in my opinion), Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg for the lead cast. It seems to fit the bill with what you're looking for it definitely has it's fair share of plot twists."
70874,"Or watch the original Hong kong version instead titled ""Infernal Affairs""."
70875,Actually don't think I've seen that one I'll have to check it out.
70876,"Please do so, I personally rated infernal affairs better than the departed."
70877,"TIME CRIMES

12 MONKEYS

Both are pretty mind bending! Enjoy"
70878,"Dude! I forgot about Time Crimes, but it was sooo good!"
72006,Inception
70880,You beat me to it.  Or am I dreaming?
70881,Let me roll the die and see
70882,"What's the twist? There's no mindfuck, it's just (absurdly) complicated."
70883,complicated? Everything is explained so much to the point that your hand is held the entire movie. The only thing kinda up for debate is the ending but even that I disagree is worth a real discussion.
70884,"Yes. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream...

And what's the twist?"
70885,"there is none. it's actually pretty linear story-wise. Everything just progresses and unfolds, even the stuff with the wife. But you already know something bad happened with her."
70886,There's no twist but the whole thing is mind fucky.
70888,The OP also asked for mind fucky movies.
70889,"An old one but it does keep surprising you: *Deathtrap* with Michael Caine, Dyan Cannon, and Christopher Reeve!"
70890,"If you liked this movie, check out **The Last of Sheila** and **Dead of Winter**.  Both are similarly brisk, nasty fun."
70891,"The Visit 

My all time favorite."
70892,Cabin in the Woods!
70893,"I will just throw in my suggestion of ENEMY. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Slow burner of a film with great cinematography, score and a fantastic mind fuck of a story."
70894,"Arrival, gets you to think a lot"
