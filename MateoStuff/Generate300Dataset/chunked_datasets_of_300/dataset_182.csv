59736,Have you tried Hypnotic Poison? I find it to be a nice wintertime scent :)
59737,"No isn't that the one with the play- dough note. It's not for me but it may work for you, give it a try."
59738,"Not all that familiar with Play-Doh, but I still like HP anyway :)"
59739,"Great collection! I love oriental, warm scents too. Out of these, which one is your favorite?"
59740,"I got Tom Ford - Black Orchid for Christmas, and it‚Äôs really really lovely. It‚Äôs sultry & mysterious. I love the patchouli notes. I feel luxurious wearing it, like I should be wearing it for special occasions or date nights. Definitely my favorite right now!"
59741,"I definitely agree with Black Orchid having a sultry, mysterious vibe. It‚Äôs such a unique scent. I‚Äôve never smelled anything similar to it. Great choice!"
59742,D&G The One and YSL Libre are two of my favourite fragrances! What a lovely collection you have
59743,Thank you! Libre is new to me but I love it! It‚Äôs the perfect sweet musk
59744,Need to try libre.. been hearing great things about it
59745,The black opium I was expecting it to smell so bomb but idk I had mixed feelings about it when smelled the fragrance in the store. It has a warm scent or maybe a little strong I don't exactly remember but it wasn't anything that had me amazed Idk
59746,"It‚Äôs definitely warm & strong - not for every day wear. I feel it‚Äôs truly different on everyone though. It smells too sweet on my sister in law, but it smells strong and spicy on me."
59747,"Great selection, specialty Libre, pffff that‚Äôs an elegant and sexy scent 10/10"
59748,"I love my Libre. And I still have Mon Paris on my wish list, but based off my samples of it it‚Äôs delicious! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
59749,"I have Mon Paris, love it. I had a rollerball first and I wonder if it‚Äôs been reformulated because my bottle is less spicy and more like a body spray.  It used to give me a horrible headache in the beginning and I‚Äôm not sure how I got used to it but it doesn‚Äôt do it anymore."
59750,YSL makes some good frags
59751,I'm curious about black orchid and Black opium. Should these be on my list?
59752,"I love both personally, but I think Black Opium is spicy in comparison to Black Orchid. Black Orchid is velvety. Depends on your preferences!"
59753,"Libre and The One are too thick and creamy for me.  I liked the opening of The One.

I love Black Opium (only for cool weather nights for me) and Black Orchid is amazing I love it but will probably never own it.  I have Mon Paris and am still trying to find my poison but I think this one is on my short list."
59754,I loved The One when I first got it but now it has a powdery scent to me. I have to be in the mood to wear it
59755,Wow I'm stupid I was gonna ask why your black opium is clear.... took me a minute
59756,Haha it‚Äôs definitely on its last leg! Almost empty
59757,I have libre and i just bought dior pure poison for a spring/summer scent and i so badly want to keep it but i feel like the dry down is almost exactly the same as libre. Only difference is libre is slightly more warm.
59758,"[This person](https://www.parfumo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=52043#52043) did a meta analysis of reviews on Fragrantica and Parfumo and came up with a ‚Äúbest of‚Äù list. Of course scent is subjective, so someone‚Äôs favorite smell can be someone else‚Äôs least favorite."
59759,"That‚Äôs a really fascinating list for a number of reasons, including that there are only four women‚Äôs perfumes in the top 20. It seems very unlikely that male-leaning fragrances are subjectively ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. I mean, Chanel no 5 has been the pre-eminent cultural touchstone for fine fragrance for almost exactly a century, compared to which Aventus‚Äôs prominence is a blink of an eye. 

I realise that maybe it‚Äôs my own biases at play here, but my sense is that women have a much greater diversity of perfume available and acceptable to wear in a variety of situations and are much less likely to obsess over batch codes and subtle (non-existent?) variations in performance. And are perhaps more likely to review both male and female scents?"
59760,"I think it's that men are more likely to sit around categorizing & rating & ranking fragrances than women are, so men's fragrances end up being disproportionately rated."
59761,"Possibly selection biases. But I‚Äôve seen quite a few women reviewers basically say they gravitate over time to masculine fragrances because they‚Äôre more varied, rich, and creative. 

Now I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true because I haven‚Äôt smelled much womens at all but I have heard it."
59762,"Really? I've heard the opposite, like LT and TS's description of men's perfume as ""The Wasteland"" and ""a men's fragrance is a women's fragrance made entirely of top notes""."
59763,"Yeah I‚Äôve also heard that. 

I think maybe everyone starts with their own gender and then when they‚Äôve explored almost everything the other gender suddenly becomes more exotic and interesting. 

Personally I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm terms of gender I just smell everything haha."
59764,"But I don‚Äôt see how the quote would make sense. I feel like men‚Äôs are not too notes at all. What makes them masculine is the rich basenotes. 

Maybe they‚Äôre talking about the mass market designer men‚Äôs releases."
59765,Doesn't exist. Subjective.
59766,"Says King Kouros ;) Kidding, I agree with you, the perfect perfume doesn‚Äôt exist."
59767,Best food ever ? Best drink ever ? ...
59769,Water!
59770,Can't live without it!
59771,"Oh, there are many of them throughout the decades. It's impossible to say that there's one greatest, because they're all so different: it's like trying to choose the one best painting out of every painting that has ever been made, or the one best TV show or novel or symphony.

Shalimar is considered one of the greats, but I don't care for it:¬†I can see its greatness, but it leaves me a little queasy. I think Mitsouko is one of the greatest scents ever made, but I know people ‚Äî smart, knowledgeable, experienced-in-perfumery people ‚Äî¬†who just don't get it. And what's more, Mitsouko has, as have all scents, been reformulated repeatedly over the years, and further, there are perfume and eau de parfum and eau de toilette and eau de cologne versions of the same scent that are all different from one another: how would you choose one version of all these possible versions to the be standard-bearer? Early '90s Mitsouko EDT is the greatest of all Mitsoukos in my limited experience: I never tried anything from the sixties, and I bet that was great, and no doubt the 1919 original was a real barn-burner, but I have tried a nineties EDP which was very good, and the EDP and the parfum from the 2010s I didn't care for at all ‚Äî too modern, too tinkered-with.

Too many variables is what I'm saying. There can never be one greatest because there are just too many variables."
59772,Probably the one created by The Perfumer. Although his methods might be controversial
59773,"The Little Book of Perfumes narrows it down further to the top 100 out of the first book.  Iris Gris is the rarest, though maybe not the GOAT.  It probably depends who you ask."
59774,"It‚Äôs so subjective that I don‚Äôt bother with the lists. Samsara was one of my first real perfumes. It agrees with my chemistry, gets me compliments from men and women alike, and I love how it smells on my clothes the next day. That‚Äôs my personal Best Perfume Ever."
59775,"Subjective, but the two fragrances that I wouldn't debate against even though I don't use them anymore are Dior Homme intense 2011 & Terre D'Hermes EDT"
59776,"Yes. Without a doubt Bandit by Robert Piguet is the greatest perfume ever created. I've smelled and tried virtually all that is to be smelled out there, including discontinued expensive rarities such as Bal a Versailles, and while many are great, nothing even comes close to the olfactory masterpiece that is Bandit."
59777,Office for Men
59778,Eau Sauvage
59779,Drakkar Noir
59780,Pegasus by parfums de marly!!
59781,"I don't really agree but I still upvoted, downvoting honest opinions is wrong.

About pegasus, it is probably the best PDM that I've tried.

To me the best perfume is naxos"
59782,"I appreciate you!! ü§üüòé

My experience with it was in Ariana and Evans soap and aftershave. Before I had to go back to go back to work (active duty Navy) i shaved my stubble and my GF at the time loved it too! Couldn't keep her out of my face üòÖ"
59783,I think pegasus is so awesome but not many ppl seem to agree. Herod and Layton / Layton exclucif sucks imo
59784,"I don't get Pegasus or Herod. But Layton Exclusif? Daaaamn, that's a banger."
59785,I loved Layton exclucif at first. Bought a bottle then I realized it has a menthol bengay smell
59786,"I see what you mean, but the menthol bengay I've smelled doesn't unfortunately quite match it in intensity."
59787,At the moment: [Black Opium](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-25324.html) by YSL.
59788,"My girlfriend wears this, and I think it‚Äôs one of the best perfumes I‚Äôve smelled (perhaps a limited number, but whatever).  
Anyway, I was in a class last semester and for whatever reason, my captain was always standing at attention if you catch my drift... it doesn‚Äôt happen in other classes really, so I didn‚Äôt know what was up.  
Then after a while it hit me.  The girl next to me wore the exact same perfume as my girlfriend every day.  I had literally been classically conditioned to get a boner in response to this smell."
59789,"The dude I'm dating is pretty fond of it as well. I sprayed some on the pillow I had used before I left his house, and the same night he texted me about how good the pillow smelt and that ""It was very hard falling asleep"" so I'm assuming he had a similar reaction as yours. Nice."
59790,"This, Coco Chanel, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, Jimmy Choo....they all have that comforting chocolatey cedar smell that I love. If anyone has other recommendations, please share."
59791,I got a sample of this from Sephora and am seriously considering buying it! It smells amazing
59792,"Do it, you won't regret it."
59793,Obsessed
59794,"A couple years ago I bought my mom a YSL Parisienne gift set.

The problem is that I really, really like it...

If another woman wore it I would feel so confused because it would remind me of my mom."
59795,I‚Äôve been indecisive about what perfume to get but this one sounds like a winner to me! :) I‚Äôm gonna try it out.
59796,Viktor & Rolf; Flowerbomb.
59797,Oh god yes. I wish it weren‚Äôt so expensive. I use it incredibly sparingly. Anyone have any cheaper recommendations similar to it?
59798,"Same here. Try out Flower by Kenzo. Has the similar sweet, flowery scent and somehow I got it for 40$ at Costco."
59799,Oh I'll check it out too! Especially for those in between days - I am obsessed with Flowerbomb but it is a expensive to use everyday!
59800,It truly is amazing I love it. I just wish it was at Ulta so I can restock on it
59802,My favorite of all time.
59804,This is the only scent I've personally bought a full-sized bottle of and used up completely. Every other perfume I have lingers for decades on my shelf. Light Blue is the best and I would always get compliments when I wore it!
59805,I got a free sample from Sephora and fell in love. Can‚Äôt wait to buy a full size bottle
59806,I love this perfume.  It‚Äôs my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù scent and always get compliments on it.
59807,"This is my work perfume, it's just a lovely refreshing citrus smell"
59808,"My collection is getting a little out of hand (when I get into something I end up diving head-first down the rabbit-hole) but my two favorites are Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream (blackberry, wisteria, jasmine, musk) and Chloe Love Story (orange blossom, jasmine, cedarwood).

I've been wearing Daisy Dream as my everyday scent and can't wait for the blasts of nostalgia I'll get later on."
59809,The notes in Daisy Dream sound appealing. Will have to sample.
59810,"Oooooh, I wear Daisy Dream almost everyday as well. It's so pretty!"
59811,I really want to get Daisy. Smells so good!
59812,Is it weird that I still like the lucky perfume (you know the pink stuff from middle school)?
59813,If it makes you happy it makes you happy!
59814,"I still have a bottle that I wear occasionally. I'll be 30 this year and I don't care, ha!"
59815,I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs not weird. I think it smells really good.
59816,Guerlain Shalimar. Zoologist Hummingbird. Maison Margiela Jazz Club. L‚ÄôArtisan Tea for Two.
59817,"These ones sound cool from the names alone, lol"
59818,My boyfriend and I both share a bottle of jazz club. It‚Äôs amazing
59819,My SO loves it too!
59820,"I love Shalimar! Shame my bottle is nearly empty because all I get is compliments about it. Ah well, this is what I get for having champagne tastes on a beer budget haha"
59821,I bought my bottle with Sephora gift cards. I hoard it and only ration it out for special days.
59822,I have a bottle of shalimar I‚Äôm looking to give up; it‚Äôs just a little too strong for me. Interested?
59823,Is it Eau de Parfum?
59824,Yup
59825,Sent you a pm :)

59827,This this this!!!! I have been going into sephora and smelling it for months now.  For Christmas I got myself the rollerball and my husband got me the bottle.  It's so light and amazing
59829,That's my current go to. So pretty.
59830,"Chanel Chance. (Pink bottle) it does well on my body. 
Also, Daisy by Marc Jacobs"
59831,"So I got these as samples but I'm really enjoying them right now: Midnight Romance by Ralph Lauren and Good Girl by Carolina Herrera. I'm not great at describing scents but these are more mature-smelling; good for a date night or feeling a bit sexy.  

As for all time favorites, Daisy Eau So Fresh by Marc Jacobs is wonderful. I also like Ralph by Ralph Lauren."
59832,"> I also like Ralph by Ralph Lauren

Love this one too. It was the first fragrance I asked for in middle school."
59833,"I like Prada Candy.


Givency Dahlia Noir


And YSL black opium is on my wishlist"
59834,I just got a sample of Prada Candy and it smells so goood !
59835,Love Prada Candy & Prada Candy Kiss.
59836,"Don‚Äôt judge but right now I love viva la juicy, the mix of jasmine and vanilla is so wonderful!"
59837,I don't really like perfume. I like body spray. Bath and Body Works fall scents are probably my favorite. Wild Madagascar Vanilla and Twilight Woods are good too
59838,Moonlight Path!!
59839,"I love Bath and Body Works ""Sea Island Cotton"". Best scent."
59840,I like those too!
59841,I love twilight woods
59842,"I still love Bombshell by Victoria's Secret. It's what I get the most compliments on by far. That, and Moschino Funny or Hippy Fizz."
59843,"The entire Miss Dior lineup. I need the snag the newest one. 

Burberry Brit: my first high end perfume 

Flowerbomb: my wedding scent 


On a day to day basis though I usually wear a body spray from Victoria's Secret. Pure seduction and love spell are the two I have, I think."
59844,"Over Christmas I finally got a chance to try out new scents, and I'm in love with Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet. So much so that two family members and the boyfriend went out individuallly and purchased it for me üòÇ"
59845,Light Blue - D&G is my go to scent!

Especially Escada

59850,Cleopatra is my favourite! Such a beautiful scent!
59851,It's amazing yes! I have a roller ball and a regular spray perfume :)
59852,giorgio armani si ‚Äî sooo lovely on
59853,Currently it‚Äôs truly dazzling by Kate Spade. J‚Äôadore by Dior is lovely too.
59854,Even Horizon from BPAL. Most of my perfumes come from them.
59855,"I love BPAL too. For some reason, most commercial perfumes smell very astringent to me. Lately I'm wearing Sin, Lust, Crowley and Lemon Scented Sticky Bat. Yum."
59856,"Versace Bright Crystal, because it smells like grapefruit."
59857,"Daisy Dream by Marc Jacobs. Used to always wear it. Now I've switched to Kenzo Intense, but still go back to that Daisy from time to time because it's so nice and light."
59858,"Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt. It was my wedding perfume, and it's one of my favourite scents hands down. I wish it would last a bit longer, but I've never smelled anything like it. 

Another I like is Chanel chance. This one is nostalgic for me, and just reminds me of holidays, and special events. It's much stronger than the Jo Malone one, so it's not an everyday scent for me, and I use it sparingly. It's the kind of perfume you'll still smell on your wrists or clothes the next day.

Viktor and Rolf flowerbomb is another favourite. It's floral and vanilla-y, but with just enough musk to make it really sophisticated and sexy. Very addicting smell!

Last one I promise, Giorgio Armani Si. I can't put my finger on what this smells like...it's floral, but sweet, but not in a candy way. Maybe a tiny bit of citrus? It's just such an unusual scent, super interesting."
59859,"Alien by Theirry Mugler, Candy by Prada, and Elipsis by Derek Lam 10 Crosby."
59861,"ugh omg Narciso rodriguez her is amazing, i got it as a sample at sephora and i immediately had to buy it. idk the other two tho"
59862,"Guerlain Gourmand Coquin 
Herm√®s Rhubarbe Ecarlate
Herm√®s Un Jardin Sur Le Toit"
59863,Marc Jacobs Daisy Dreams is my favourite! It smells so clean and fresh but not overpowering.
59864,Daisy - Marc Jacobs. Plus bombshell- Victoria secret but daisy is my daily
59865,"Calvin Klein Truth for men- 
> fresh, squeaky, green, professional, like cut grass, a whisper of sweetness. Pretty unisex in my opinion and great for work especially since it doesn't project wildly but stays close to the skin.

Crabtree and Evelyn Summer Hill- 
> white field flowers!! Sunshine and linen!! Peach!! Wildflowers! Bright and joyful without being screechy. Smells like a childhood lotion to me for some reason, smells like safety and home and mothers. A more feminine choice"
59866,Anything by Victoria‚Äôs Secret is typically really good and relatively inexpensive. I also like Michael Kors Sexy Amber.
59867,Replay girls
59868,"My collection is a little excessive, but my favorite ever is ‚ÄúLaila‚Äù by Geir Ness. 

...I actually really like Pitbull‚Äôs perfume, too. Like, the rapper Pitbull."
59869,"I actually really like Avril Lavigne's Black Star, I used it a lot a few years ago but haven't used perfume in general in a good while"
59870,"Gucci - Rush 2

Byredo - Gypsy Water

Both incredible. The Gucci one not quite as long-lasting as I'd want it to be but I've been wearing it for 10+ years and still love it to bits as my every day perfume."
59871,I absolutely love [1954 by Fossil](https://fimgs.net/images/perfume/375x500.27057.jpg).
59872,Fantasy by Britney Spears
59873,Philosophy - Ballet Rose
59874,"Dang! I cannot believe how many folks like Viktor and Rolf Flowerbomb!!! That is my go-to as well. Applied with roller is the way to go, imo. 

Right now, I am Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille. Smells so good but is quite expensive."
59875,Marshmallow by MOR
59876,"Year round:
The Body Shop British Rose is a great rose note. I wear it all year practically. 

Winter/Fall:
[My Burberry Black](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Burberry/My-Burberry-Black-32566.html) ‚Äî surprisingly gourmand, but not overpowering or gross (definitely not BBW-let‚Äôs-spray-vanilla-on-everything). Very sophisticated peach with amber. 

[Coco Chanel](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Coco-Eau-de-Parfum-609.html) ‚Äî to quote my little just-for-me review: ‚ÄúDries down to fresh baked, strong gingerbread but there‚Äôs also powdery floral undertones‚Äù

IÔ∏è still don‚Äôt have anything for Spring/Summer. I‚Äôm looking at an indie perfume like [TheLittleBookEater‚Äôs Anna Karenina](http://etsy.me/2DpBuoL) but who knows. IÔ∏è didn‚Äôt expect Burberry or Coco Chanel to woo me."

59878,"Midnight fantasy by Britney Spears 

Pink sugar by aquolina 

Gucci Guilty"
59879,Tender Romance by Ralph Lauren
59880,"My all-time favorite is CK Eternity Moment. I've been using it for over 10 years. It's not as heady as the original Eternity and it's a little fruitier because of the lychee note and the peony is just lovely. I've received the most compliments while wearing this one.

A close second is Lancome Miracle, which is a spicier version of the above. It's a wonderful fruity-floral scent.

A new top favorite is Jennifer Lopez's Still. I'm not a loyal fan of hers, but I was curious about this perfume because of the Earl Grey note. It's great if you want something light to wear that has some dimension."
59881,Joie Folle de Joie!
59882,Jimmy choo eau de parfum!
59883,"I rotate between three: Clean Skin Reserve Blend, Philosophy Amazing Grace, and Tory Burch (her first fragrance). That way I don‚Äôt become ‚Äúscent blind‚Äù to them and they last longer!

I also really liked Jimmy Choo Illicit Flower but I won‚Äôt repurchase it because it‚Äôs an eau de toilette and wore off so quickly."
59884,I love all of the Elizabeth and James perfumes (except for the Rose one)!
59885,"oooh ive got 4 currently. all are relatively cheap, with the most expensive around 80$ (but half price if you buy two)

* absolute fuchsia diamond paris
* princess marina de bourbon paris marina blue
* scandalous from Victoria's secret
* i am happy from maurices

absolute fuchsia has a distinct scent, hard to describe, sweet with a strong tinge of the alcohol

marina blue is a very light, fresh scent, it reminds me of the ocean a bit even though it isnt at all salty.

scandalous is the ""heaviest"" scent i own. its the sort of thing i would wear on a date where i planned to do more than kiss :P

i am happy is a light, fruityish scent, it has the least smell of the alcohol, and lasts the shortest period of time (it was only 18$) Its the sort of thing i put on in the morning, or marina blue, rather than fuchsia or scandalous, which strike me as more evening scents :)"

I was actually disappointed when I first smiled philosykos because I wanted It to be more complex... it's beautiful but ~~not worth buying when the Pacifica version is like $10 and the same~~ RIP it was discontinued :'((((

Edit: :((((("
59928,UGH why must you torture me?? I've been wanting to try some nice fig scents lately.
59929,"I loved California Star Jasmine, which of course means it was discontinued."
59930,"Yes. I am also one of the Tibetan Mountain Temple mourners, forever seeking a dupe. I‚Äôve tried several indie fragrances mentioned as similar, but none are TMT. I have maybe 2.5 ml left in my last bottle. Sigh."
59931,wow what does it smell like??
59932,"Sweet and spicy. Peaceful. Ginger and frankincense, with a touch of orange, patchouli,  vetiver, and the littlest bit of violet. It gives the sense of vanilla, cinnamon, and anise, despite not including those elements. It‚Äôs a very comforting scent. 

In my desperation, I actually bought half ounces of each of the 6 component notes from Demeter. (Demeter has a whole bunch of single note fragrances, some way better than others).  They also sell a blending kit with an empty perfume bottle, little pipettes, etc. 

I experimented with blending the notes, trying to capture an impression of TMT. I found that the ginger and frankincense notes were the main players (to my nose), with the other notes blending to provide accompaniment. 

At first I was really excited with my result, but then I compared it to my last drops of real TMT. If real TMT is a 10 in complexity and intensity, my concoction was maybe a 4-5. I just couldn‚Äôt manage the strength and blend with the tools at hand. Demeter‚Äôs sprays are famously short lived with poor longevity, although some are exceptions. And some just smell amazing, so you don‚Äôt mind that they are short lived (Ginger Ale, Angel Food, Wet Garden, imho). 

I‚Äôve read reviews here and in the indiemakeupandmore sub, following the recommendations of others searching for their TMT fix. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab makes Shub Niggurath, which touches upon some of the notes. (BPAL‚Äôs Plunder is also in the neighborhood.) Someone mentioned Hexennacht‚Äôs Inferno (now also discontinued!) as a cousin, and I do indeed like it as a cinnamonny relative of TMT. I have yet to try Poesie‚Äôs Shy Ghost, which I also read was similar. But so far, nothing has really captured the TMT essence, which is weird to me, as it is so nice. I would think it would be repeated somewhere!

The search continues, though."
59933,wow what a description haha i wish i got to smell it & best of luck on ur search :‚Äô)
59934,"Sounds like a similar vibe to L'Artisan Parfumeur Tea for Two, but if course, that shiz is expensive :("
59935,I will check that one out!
59936,I‚Äôm particularly partial to French Lilac
59937,"I second the Pacifica scents! Dream moon is great and I just bought Blue moon. I also like their French lilac, and BBW's Rose"
59938,"Second Pacifica. One of my favorites has been Sugared Amber, I also like Tahitian Gardenia by them. Silver Moon is a hypnotic poison dupe. Kindred Spirits is a really interesting rose + palo santo scent, it reminds me of incense.

I also like Jessica Simpson Vintage Bloom, it's like a delicate lemon cake. Rihanna Reb'l Fleur is a cozy pineapple scent. Adam Levine for her is quite unisex, it's a spicy sandalwood. Britney Spears Private Show is a dulche de leche latte scent.

As far as body mists, I LOVE the ones by Sol De Janeiro. Cheirosa 71 is the best, it's like a warm cookie out of the oven.

Tea Rose is another great cheapie. It's a very strong and realistic rose.

I have a rollerball of Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely You and it's a super nice musky scent. I think you can get it at Kohl's for around $20."
59939,Second Tea Rose. Every so often I have to buy a bottle.
59940,"Outremer can be found for very little.  Great scents, some are even EDP's and extraits.  Most generally under 20US dollars.  Hard to find in stores (Anthropologie has a limited amount)

\+1 on Pacifica.  

Zum has some very interesting scents.   My favorite Myrrh and Frankincense

And while this did not start off life as a cheapy, Alfred Sung Shi, Pure, and Sung are generally very cheap.

&#x200B;

Also, everyone should try SJP Covet.    Def. not your average celeb scent."
59941,Yes on outremer. You can get it at Anthropologie. I like oceane the best. Smells good and has staying power on me.
59942,I love Covet.
59943,"Outreamer Cola, doesn't last long, but it's fun. 

You of course do smell like a can of cola exploded on you earlier in the day though"
59944,"Agree with the others about Pacifica. 

Mix Bar at Target has some good ones. 

Good Chemistry North Sky 

B&BW In the Stars

Outremer Vanille and Ocean are great, excellent performance. I want to try Bergamot too. 

Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and the flankers. Especially Green Tea and Fig 

Perfumer‚Äôs Workshop Tea Rose 

Zara Cardamom and A Mochi Atelier in Tokyo 

I‚Äôm curious about the Urban Outfitters perfumes, though I think performance might vary among the line based on my testing. Pistachio sounds amazing but my nose can‚Äôt find it when I spray."
59945,Ooh I second BBW‚Äôs In the Stars
59946,"EA Green Tea and Fig is so lush. I‚Äôm yet to try Diptyque Philosykos and L‚ÄôArtisan Parfumeur Premier Figuier, I wonder how it compares to them."
59947,"I sampled Philosykos and absolutely fell in love, but I don't have money for that lol. Got ea green tea and fig hoping it would be similar but it's not at all. GT and fig is sharp and sour to me and gave me a headache, had to return. Philosykos is fresh, green, milky sweet fig."
59948,"Zino Davidoff, Cool Water"
59949,"Or the green version via Aspen.

(Edit:Spelling)"
59950,"I have both, cant get enough of either them"
59951,"Jenny Glow. Does a lot of Jo Malone dupes which smell exactly the same and cost peanuts. As a fan of Jo Malone I don't think I will ever go back. So far from Jenny Glow I have sandalwood and rose and they both smell so good, just like the real deal. Also has a lot of my other favorites like Myrrh and Tonka, Wood Sage and Sea Salt and Mimosa and Cardamom. I'm delighted, bit annoyed I didn't find out sooner because I could have saved so much money but definitely better late than never."
59952,Is Jenny Glow in the US?
59953,It appears they are in Ireland but do not ship to the US.
59954,Do they have the same longevity as Jo Malone? So many of her scents i love but just disappear pretty quickly
59955,Rihanna Reb‚Äôl Fleur
59956,"Encre Noire A L'Extreme. Repeating what has been said a million times, at this price point, you really can't beat what it delivers in terms of potency and character."
59957,very aromatic and intensely woody. my dad gifted it to me a while ago and its still in me closet. love it
59958,"* Pacifica Tuscan Blood Orange. Roller balls are cheap. I think they are around $10-15.


* Florida Water. It‚Äôs stupid cheap.  Like $5/7 oz.  Both of these are faves for summer.


* Still by Jennifer Lopez. Soft sweet tea scent.  ~$12 online.


* Cloud. Reasonably nice dupe of BR540. Deals for the perfume online are good. I grabbed the body spray for when I want a smidgen of BR540 without the time commitment."

59961,Nautica voyage always have to keep a bottle
59962,"The Body Shop British Rose - I only have the body cream but I wouldn't mind getting the fragrance spray, it's really nice. I also want to try BBW Rose.

White Shoulders is pretty cheap and a total classic, very clean and floral.

CK One can be found incredibly cheap through discounters, I wore it in high school (yes the 90s) and I've been thinking about picking up a small bottle again for old times' sake."
59963,Same and same on the CK One. Spotted a bottle at TJ Maxx the other day for about 20 bucks and I was \*thisclose\* to grabbing it for nostalgia's sake but I changed my mind last minute. I need to slow my roll...
59964,"Fun fact, White Shoulder turns into baby vomit on my skin. Really pisses me off too..."
59965,Urban Outfitters Oud Sahara. So warm and comforting with a touch of spice
59966,This looks like something I want to try.

59970,"SJP Lovely, CK Euphoria, Cacharel LouLou, Aquolina Pink Sugar, D&G Light Blue can all be found for v reasonable prices and are very pretty! I like Dana Tabu as well but it‚Äôs probably more divisive"
59971,"LouLou is such a classic and amazing scent. My mom used to wear it and stopped a while ago so I decided to take it off her hands!üòÖ I was very happy as it‚Äôs a vintage one from like 1998ish. As a man, I love it!"
59972,"I smelled someone wearing Pink Sugar the other day! I chased her down to tell her how good she smelled and to ask if it was, in fact, Pink sugar. It‚Äôs one of those scents that make me want to give the wearer a big hug!"
59973,"I love LouLou, and Cacharel in general. I also enjoy Anais Anais and the controversial Eden."
59974,"Aqualina Pink Sugar is good for the price, however,worth noting that for a few dollars more you can easily get Reb'l Fleur, Fantasy or Purr, which are somewhat in similar ballpark but all smell of higher quality."
59975,"Eau de Gaga. Found it for 20$ on Amazon. Lime, violets, and leather :)"
59976,"I bought a 50 ml tester for $7 and I couldn't resist. It smells much more expensive than it is, but the sharp lime opening can be a little off-putting. Loveee the dry down tho"
59977,"I recently bought G.Bellini Homme Paris from Lidl for ‚Ç¨4.99. The bottle is very similar to Dior Sauvage and I read on some forums that the perfume is infact a cheap dupe of Dior Sauvage. I have only smelled Dior Sauvage once when I gifted a bottle to my brother but I really like the smell and performance of the Lidl fragrance.

 I've been meaning to ask this in the Newbie tread but has anyone tried the other Lidl fragrances and can give a recommendation for a Summer fragrance in their line. I saw another fragrance which looked to be a dupe of Bleu de Chanel."
59978,"Burberry London, Lattafa Raghba and Lattafa Qaa‚Äôed are all great cheapies."
59979,Cool Water and Aspen
59980,"I just sampled Burberry Brit for Men/Him recently which prompted me to get a bottle ('vintage'), good stuff. Also, Grey Flannel, Versace L'Homme, Caron Pour un Homme."
59981,"Burberry Brit is one of those that I used to always have on hand. I haven't bought a bottle in a year or two, but I might have to go pick one up in the next cpl days. It is a very nice scent. I'm a pretty big fan of Grey Flannel too. I picked it up one day just for the hell of it. I figured for $10, if I didn't like it, I could give it away or find some use for it. But I was pretty happy with it"
59982,"What else do you like? If we click on the Burberry and Grey Flannel, I wonder if there's others :)"
59983,"The list is so long. But some of my absolute favorites are Virgin Island Water, Dior Homme, MMM Replica Jazz Club, MMM At the Barber, Clive Christian Rock Rose. For more affordable stuff Armani Code, John Varvatos, JPG Le Male, Clinique Happy, Monte Blanc Explorer, Vercase Baby Blue Jeans"
59984,"B&BW Gingham is a wonderful scent! I enjoy that one. 

Some of my other favorite ‚Äúcheapies‚Äù, as it were, are:

Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Nectarine Blossom, Jennifer Aniston Beachscapes, and From Wilds Brilliant Bloom (mimosa). The From Wilds is from Target: $18 for 1 oz!"
59985,"Puig's Quorum. Fantastic.  


Honourable mentions: the Arami--Amaris, Devin, Havana, 900, and Tuscany."
59986,"Hanae by Hanae Mori, I can‚Äôt believe how good it is- I‚Äôm so damn picky especially with hyper feminine fragrances and this one is just beyond delicious and intoxicating! To me it‚Äôs basically flowerbomb but so much better and smoother."
59987,Oooh i like this one a lot
59988,"Many of the Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea line. I've only disliked one of the several I've tried, Green Tea Mimosa. The rest have all been likable to one degree or another. And they're really inexpensive."
59989,"I tried Spiced Green Tea, it was a dud for me."
59990,"My favorite cheapies are Sofia by Sofia Vergara ($20), guess seductive noir ($15-20), banana republic 90 ($20), and mix bar vanilla bourbon ($18)"
59991,"I can only afford cheapie so most of my perfumes are cheapie XD

Antonio Banderas Seduction In Black is my cheapest and used to be my daily wear in the evening. On a hot day, FCUK Friction or Nautica Voyage do the job for me."
59992,Perry ellis red 360
59993,This right here. Big compliment getter for me during the summer months. Bummer they discontinued Perry Ellis M. Can't find it anymore and I wanted to try it so bad as well. Do you have that one too?
59994,"I love Ciara by Revlon but I don't think anyone around me does very much! It is the resiny-est of glorious resiny incense! 

I got Kristin Ess The One in the mail today and OMG I really love it! Scored it off  eBay for $12. I've seen twice now that it might be a good dupe for Mojave Ghost but I cannot personally confirm."
59995,"You just reminded me that I used to really like Revlon's Fire & Ice. I don't know if they still make it, but I haven't seen it in years and years and years."
59996,I've definitely seen it on discount sites!
59997,I haven‚Äôt smelled Ciara in years...I wore it in high school in the 90‚Äôs.

60000,I believe I paid under 30$usd for each.  The E & J's are small rollerball versions.
60001,I read Lancome and was like.... uh... LOL
60002,"Nautica voyage, jordan legend, davidoff cool water, st barts, tommy by tommy hilfiger, montblanc legend night. Id rank them jordan legend first in terms of scent, cool water or tommy in terms of versatility. I love the coffee in legend and its has commendable longevity and projection. Unfortunately its mostly a winter and fall scent. Cool water is in fact close to green irish tweed and they are both good for most anything, if a little more of a mainstream green fresh scent. Tommy by tommy is a new one i tried and liked, its decently unique and usable. Voyage and st barts are mostly warm weather scents, id put voyage above st barts tbh, i like the musk and its stronger. Ive gotten a lot of sunscreen comments on st barts, but its still good, although weak. Montblanc legend night is a great gourmand scent, deep, dark, and syrupy is how i describe it. Performance and projection isnt great though admittedly, and i prefer jordan legend which i think serves around the same purpose, so im giving away the Montblanc to my friend."
60003,"Oui √Ä L‚ÄôAmour by Yves Rocher. It was on sale when I got it. I mostly wear it indoors, but I love it so much."
60004,Why indoors? Is it a bee attactor?
60005,"Because to me, it‚Äôs a really cozy, comforting fragrance, so I find myself reaching for it when I‚Äôm just lazing around :)."
60006,Sunshine Mimosa from bath body works. I got it for less than $5 and I love it! It smells so juicy on me and actually last 4 hours which is decent considering the price. I also picked up Gingham for $5.50 and I do not know what it is about that one but I like it. It‚Äôs VERY different from anything I‚Äôve ever smelled but I really like the smell. Don‚Äôt know how to describe it.
60007,"I can't describe Gingham, either, except that it makes my eyes cross in euphoria. Only one other perfume ever did that to me, but it's so weak and it's long been discontinued."
60008,H&M perfumes - ‚Äúlipstick‚Äù and ‚Äú way past midnight .
60009,Pacifica Sugared Amber Dreams is really great and I think it was about $20.00

60013,Al-Rehab perfume oils are great.  My favorite is Choco-Musk.
60014,Not sure if Ariana Grande‚Äôs perfumes count as they range from 22-60 ish? But I got Sweet Like Candy as a gift and it‚Äôs been growing on me. I know a lot of people say it smells immature and childlike but it gives me middle/high school nostalgia vibes. I feel like if I was 15 and owned it at the time I would‚Äôve been obsessed.

5) Calvin Klein - CK One Shock"
60017,"For someone who rarely pays more than ¬£40 for perfume these days, I've barely explored cheapies. Getting a good deal on something pricey must be more satisfying üòú

Les Senteurs Gourmandes Vanille de la Reunion is my cheapest fave. It was ¬£23/100ml.

ETA do celeb scents count? They're cheap by default but if so, Rihanna Reb'l Fleur and Rihanna Rogue."
60018,"I was just at tjmaxx and picked up Tru Fragrace Element Edition Pearl. I couldn't find it on fragrantica, it was $19.99 at TJX and $24 on Amazon for 3.4 oz. It's such a lovely second skin scent. Most second skin scents on me are too warm and ambery but this one is more neutral and fresh, it still has a coziness but is overall such a 'you but better' perfume. I found a blog that describes it as ""This particular scent ‚ÄòPearl‚Äô is inspired by its calming effects, which will leave you feeling relaxed in this chaotic world. Just like a unique gem, the notes Peach, Rosewater, and Skin Musk won‚Äôt go unnoticed.

Top Notes: Peach, Osmathus

Mid Notes: Orchid, Honeysuckle

Base Notes: Skin Musk, Tonka Bean"""

60031,"There are tons, but some of the one's I have now are English Laundry Oxford Bleu( it is like a toned down Eros with the slightest touch of BDC), Clinique Happy(One of my all-time fav summer scents), Ferragamo Black, English Laundry Arrogant(it smells like a cross between Le Male and something else familiar. Can't quite put my finger on it), John Varvatos(all except one or two are great), Grey Flannel, and last but not least JPG Le Male( I got my 3.4 bottle for something like 25. I got two seperate English Laundry sets, both with 4 bottles 1 oz each. Most of them are great for just a quick grab for something different. There was only one or two I didn't care for. Tahitian Waters my daughter loved. I HATED it. Smelled like chemical and feet with some other nasty smell mixed in. The two listed above were pretty great. The other's were take or leave, but were overall pretty well made, just not really my cup o' tea."

60035,I loved that scent as well. I‚Äôve been looking for another bottle. The longevity and projection on me was so good.. but I had it while I was with my first bf so not sure lmao
60036,"I guess ""discontinued"" is a repeating theme in this post, but I'm babying the last bit of my Coty *Raw Vanilla*, after clumsily spilling like half the bottle on the floor.

Same for my St Charles Shave Co one-off *Santalum Album*, and *Sandalwood From Wood*. Discontinued, and of course I stupidly dropped one of my bottles of Sandalwood From Wood to shatter on the floor. The one-off Santalum Album is something I treasure, but at least I haven't spilled it yet.

Lalique *Encre Noir* smells nice and is pretty cheap.

Edit: Stirling Soap now makes an EdT of one of my favorite vetiver ""blending"" scents, *Port au Prince!* It's vetiver and lemongrass, great for brightening up Encre Noir or deepening Terre de Hermes. I've long loved the aftershave, but now there's perfume juice! Next paycheck, Port au Prince, you are mine!

Speaking of Terre de Hermes, Yardley *Citrus and Wood* gets most of the way there, sans Iso E Super. But is it discontinued now? Ack!"
