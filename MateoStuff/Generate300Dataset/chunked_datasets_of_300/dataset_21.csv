6817,For me personally it is my current XR. It's just such a solid phone in every way that I care enough to notice.
6818,The 7 Plus. Was really the best iPhone I’ve ever used
6819,7 Plus Jet black for durability but that 11 pro Max battery is god tier and pretty solid so this one takes it
6820,iPhone 11 Pro Max lol my first iPhone and been in love with it since I got it when it first came out.
6821,"Iphone 11, X before that and android before X(i never looked back)"
6822,"I’m loving my 11 Pro. I know it’s new and all that, but it feels just perfect to me. I’m very spoilt by it."
6823,"Never owned an iPhone, but the iPhone 5 in Slate Black with the classic home button is my absolute favorite design of all time. The 4/4s is the runner up. 6 onwards are just ugly, but I’ve accustomed by its design by now."
6824,11 pro
6825,"8+, the one i have now lol"
6826,Iphone 6 . Was my first smartphone after i finished my schooling so yep
6827,"XS max for me. it was the first year since 2013 that I didn’t do a yearly upgrade and although the battery is starting to run down, this phone is a beast. great screen, super snappy, camera still holds up. so much to like here"
6828,"The iPhone 5 in Slate black. First phone bought at launch, the design, performance and camera was absolutely incredible in comparison to the bulky 3GS I had before. iOS 6’s aesthetic complemented the design so well I haven’t seen a single iPhone since that has such uniformity between hardware and software."
6829,6s best iPhone ever released
6830,iPhone 11.
6831,"Iphone SE 2016, that thing lasted throughout almost anything I could throw at it. Getting lost on ski hills, flipped over canoes etc etc

Loved the design, form factor and 3.5 mm AUX. Still best phone I think they ever released based on value per dollar."
6832,"I had the 4s, 5s, 6s, 7 Plus, and now the X.  The 5s and the X so far are my favorites. I love the size of the 5, 5s, and first SE, it feels perfect. I've had my X for almost 3 years now and performance wise, its the best phone I've ever owned and honestly I could probably go another year with it because its still having zero performance problems. My dream is a full screen iPhone like the X in a 5s body. I would throw so much money at that."
6833,iPhone 5 was awesome
6834,"7 Plus because of the battery life and camera, with my XS Max at a close second

most exciting always gonna be my iphone 4 tho"
6835,"7 Plus was really cool. I started with a 4, moved up to 5, and then held out a few years. The leap from 5 to 7 Plus in terms of design and features seemed the biggest."
6836,iphone 8 in gold color. The modern A11 chip and classic post-iphone 6 design makes it my favorite smartphone.
6837,iPhone 8 rose gold. Will update to 12 pro max whenever it comes out.
6838,"After having several variations since my first 3GS, my XS Max is actually my first iPhone where I’ve felt the least likely to upgrade.  Fast, sleek and I love Face ID more than the fingerprint sensor.  Sure the current mask situation has made it a bit more difficult, but I still love it.  Apple is going to have to really wow me to upgrade from this one."
6839,4S was the perfect size and an all around great phone. I wish they had kept that form factor.
6840,7
6842,"iPhone 3G, the feel in your hand was unmatched. Can’t believe I’ve used every one since now I’m on the 11"
6843,"I absolutely adored my six and I got it on release day, but my 11 is wonderful"
6844,iPhone 5 space grey was tight
6845,"I have a soft spot for my iPhone 3G but it was quite buggy and the camera was early 2000s webcam quality but the experience was like no other at the time. The iPhone 4 was probably the one I think of the most, amazing camera, decent battery life, beautiful screen, loved YouTube and other streaming apps over 3G with that device. The camera on the 4 is STILL good after all these years"
6846,Favorite design wise the 4. However antenna gate sucked. In terms of functionality the 11 pro max.
6847,"IPhone 7 , still going strong"
6848,"Honestly form factor and experience, iPhone 4S! Maybe because that was my very first iPhone too and it all felt new to me."
6849,"the 11 Pro is the first phone where i don’t feel like i need the newer model. it’s the first time i’ve felt like there’s nothing wrong with it. amazing display, cameras, build, battery life, speakers are pretty good, plus i’m jailbroken so i have all that extra stuff. instead of an iPhone 12 i’m buying applecare+ and i’ll get the iPhone 13."
6850,Definitely SE 1gen :)
6851,iPhone 4 was the best one ever...
6852,"iPhone 6, crazy thin and light (all the later ones gained in thickness and weight) and loved the all aluminum chassis."
6854,The iPhone 4 was my first true smartphone that I truly enjoyed using (the Samsung Continuum was buggy and slow). Then I moved to the iPhone 6 which is still my favorite phone. Currently using a Pixel 2 XL since 18' but I'm super excited for the iPhone 12.
6855,"iPhone X the best and the worst for me.

Used to own 4s, 6 and 7 then got myself the X.
Screen, Face ID, camera, wireless charging & fast charging are just amazing. The best iPhone for sure.

But the model I got had problems ever since.. at start it had terrible internet connectivity. My provider blamed Apple and Apple point towards my provider. 
Then out of nowhere it stopped working with my computer, iMac and MacBook. Apple said it was a problem with my MacBook (diagnostics) but it was with my iPhone.. they did replace it but the connectivity still wasn’t resolved.
Battery is not bad but far from great, I own this device for 1,5-2 years now and battery is down to 84% health.

Now waiting for the new iPhones to buy a new one. Preferably iPhone 12 pro, or might go for the smaller size (if those rumors are true)."
6856,I have to say the iPhone XR
6857,XS Max.
6858,My iPhone 5 is still in my heart.
6859,"8+ by a long way, worst iphone i’ve had is the XS by a long way. 
Honourable mention goes to the iphone 4"
6860,6S from last 4 years
6861,"5s hands down. Best battery out of them all, photos always looked crisp and clear, the speakers never weakened. All around good phone. 6s plus was the worst. My X is second best I’ve had."
6862,Why did you find the 6s plus the worst if I may ask?
6863,"Straight out of the box it would never switch to LTE that lasted for months until one day it finally kicked in. Could not hear on it AT ALL had to always use speaker and the battery life was absolutely terrible. Phone signal was poor too, my husband and I both had same carrier and his 5s at the time would have signal in places my 6s plus wouldn’t."
6864,"The XR I have now I guess.

I was late to the party. I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old, but when the iPhone came out, I was still into my Blackberry. I experimented with Android breifly (ugh) and then Windows Phone, which I loved for 3-4 years. I would have honestly stayed with Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it's UI ideas tbh, but it tanked.

I finally jumped ship and got a 5S. After that a 6S plus, 8 plus and now the XR. It wasn't until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones. It took me some time to warm up to iOS, but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it. 

My XR is my favorite so far, but it has a few limitations. Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus, which was too big for me and the XS didn't have the battery life I wanted. The XR's cheap price made it an easy decision and it's been great. I think I'll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par."
6865,i’ve got an iPhone 11 and a 11 Pro Max. love them both
6866,"Are you a fan of cases? In this case (hehe) I’d recommend the 12-line since Apple’s cases, especially the silicone ones, got much better in terms of feeling and looks."
6867,I have the 11 and I’m really disappointed in the camera. My husband best friend has the 11 as well and same thing with his camera. Like I thought it was just my phone but nope. My husband has the 11 pro and has no issues with it though!
6868,"The 11 is a solid purchase. 
Bought mine 3 months ago and loving it so far."
6869,"I’m a big apple user but I’m still on the iPhone 8 as the newer phone features aren’t things I’m into although the new iTags or an telephoto type camera will likely get me upgrading.    
See what features you want to use and check which phones have them."
6870,"Depends on what characteristics are important to you. If screen size is important, then you're looking at a standard iPhone 11 or 12, or one of the Pro Max sizes. If premium 4k video options, a premium camera, Dolby Vision, Apple's new ProRaw format, or very fast processing speed are all important to you, then you'll want to consider the Pro line. Though I have to admit the standard 11 and 12 are still very good in all categories.

Our whole fam has recently upgraded to iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Everyone seems very happy with their phone. I came from an old Google Pixel to the 12 Pro Max after being with Android for 10+ years.

Of course, there are some things I miss about Android, but the transition was pretty easy and I'm still glad I did 2 months later!"
6871,"Hard desicion between the 11 and the extra cost for the minor upgrades on the 12. Just the Design ist pretty awesome. But is it worth 200€ idk. 

Thanks for your reply"
6872,"2 of our 5 phones are the 12 Pro Max. I needed one, because I was interested in recording 4k video with Dolby Vision, and the 12 Pro Max has 1x more optical zoom than the standard 11 or 12 (I record soccer games from a distance, so that matters a lot to me). One of my daughters got the other 12 Pro Max, but mainly for one simple reason....it was free! I found a BOGO (buy one get one) that forced her to get a new number through Verizon. She was young enough and didn't care about a new number, so that worked out well!

Of course, the 12 models have better low-light camera performance and a slightly better sensor, but the 11 is still pretty good by today's standards. If you don't really need any of the slight upgrades the 12 brings to the table, you'll be happy settling for the 11, or might want to consider waiting for the 13 (or whatever Apple decides to name it).

6873,how are you liking the battery life on the 12 pro max?
6874,"I love it! If I fully charge the phone, I easily make it through the day without needing to recharge, and I'm using it constantly. On days where I'm using it a little below average, I even make it through the night without recharging. I've had the phone 8 months now, and no change in battery life whatsoever!

Also love the fact that if I plug it into a fast-charging adapter, I only need about 15-20 min to get it up past 60%. This is easily the best battery I've ever had in a smartphone.

The one activity that drains it fast is recording 4k video at 60fps. I can get about 2.5 - 3 hrs of record time before dropping below 15%. That's still impressive to me, considering the screen is on that entire time and it's processor is working hard. If I'm just watching video with bluetooth headphones (like on a trip), the battery lasts forever. After a few hours of binge watching a Netflix show the other day, I noticed the battery barely drained. Think I started with about 90% and still had like 65%. That's just amazing to me."
6875,"If you tend to keep your phones for several years, the extra $200 is fine."
6876,iPhone XS
6877,"iPhone 6s.

The leap from 6 to 6s was astronomical even to this day."
6878,"True,the 6 was not good enough,from bendgate issue and the 1gb ram is also the case why the 6 dint get ios 13 and above."
6879,"Touch Disease was the worst

It was more common on the 6+ but still an issue on the 6"
6880,could you elaborate on that? just asking out of curiosity
6881,"The 6s has new features like:

-	Stronger aluminum chasis
-	4k video capture 
-	3D Touch
-	2nd gen. TouchID
-	Stronger glass
-	4 microphones

The 4k video and 3D touch alone is what makes the 6s upgrades the best one yet in terms of hardware.

Nowadays the upgrade from iPhone to iPhone involves mainly just the camera and battery improvements."
6882,"* It also introduced a much faster processor - the A9 was one of the biggest CPU and GPU jumps ever in an iPhone, with 70% and 90% gains over the A8.

* 2GB RAM, which made a massive difference.

* The modem was upgraded to LTE Advanced.

* Gaskets were added to make the phone water resistant. It wasn’t marketed that way until the following year’s iPhone 7, but it was the 6S when the iPhone first gained water resistance.

* The Taptic Engine. Just like above, it wasn’t really marketed that way until it was improved with the iPhone 7, but it was actually the 6S when Apple switched from the old rumble to the precise Taptic Engine using a linear actuator.

* “Hey Siri”. This was the first phone that allowed you to activate Siri with your voice.


The iPhone 6S truly was a gem. It’s insane how many improvements it provided.

Apple typically has camera years, performance years, new hardware feature years, new hardware UI input years, case redesign years, new display years, and improved connectivity years. Usually a new iPhone will focus on maybe 2-3 of those 7 categories, and then the next year they’ll focus on 2 more. The iPhone 6S got 5 of the 7 categories. It was truly a *massive* upgrade.

Perhaps that explains why the iPhone 6 was such a small upgrade. It’s like the new tech wasn’t quite ready, so it got pushed back, and then the 6S ended up getting two years worth of upgrades in one phone."
6883,"Very nice summary. Typing from a 6S, I agree with everything you said.

Nonetheless, you got the “Hey Siri” thing wrong. The 6S was the first iPhone to be able to listen continuously for the “Hey Siri” command even while unplugged. Other iOS devices could use “Hey Siri” too, but only while using the charger.

I would also say that even if iOS 13 (and presumably iOS 14) is really fluid on the 5 year old 6S, you can feel it really isn’t optimized for it because of the heating and battery problems that it suffers since iOS 11. But still, it is astonishing how well it runs it."
6884,"Just got SE 2020 to upgrade from my 6s, since then i reset my 6s into factory settings and oh boiiii it was buttery smooth than the iOS 14 beta on my SE!

I’m planning to replace my 6s battery and home button so i could actually use it as a second phone."
6885,"Same situation here. I waited about a year after the 6s release to pick it up and has been my very reliable daily driver until the new SE 2020 came out. I bought it immediately and did as you did and did a factory reset on the 6s and had the carrier unlock it. Now I use it as a remote for just about everything in my house. Gonna keep it handy in case a second phone is needed. As long as it’s getting OS updates, it’s worth keeping around."
6886,"You’re correct, perhaps I should have specified that it’s the first device that can use “Hey Siri” wirelessly. But as far as I’m concerned, that makes it the first device with “Hey Siri” because phones are meant to be wireless. I only have my phone plugged in when I’m going to bed or if I’ve run out of battery. The vast majority of the time I’m using the phone and the vast majority of the time I need Siri, the phone is not plugged in, so that makes the 6S the first phone with “Hey Siri” functionality that serves a purpose for me."
6887,"I think that just applies to your use case. I frequently use “Hey Siri” at bed while plugged to set the alarm for the next morning or to check the weather when I don’t really want to move a single muscle anymore. And I have done it since “Hey Siri” was a thing, even before owning the 6S. Maybe that’s just me, idk.

I was just pointing the fact out, though."
6888,"And that's not even it!! The 6S also got a 5MP front facing camera which was a huge improvement. Another feature the phone got was dual band 10.2.11ac WiFi which allowed it to get double the WiFi speed of the 6 (which had single band ac WiFi) under some conditions. The 6s also has NVMe based storage (1800mbps read speeds!!) unlike the 6.

Also, not only was there 2GB of RAM, but they changed to LPDDR4 starting with the 6S, unlike the 6 and iPad Air 2 which used LPDDR3."
6889,Isn’t the 6 had the Taptic (Haptic) engine too?
6890,"No, 6s was the first one with it"
6891,also the jump to 2GB or ram which makes a huge difference in IOS speed to this day
6892,I own both 6 and 6s and to be honest the camera on 6s is way much better than the 6 especially on night photos the 6s look way much clearer.
6893,"And that’s all on top of the huge improvements the A9 brought over the A8. Huge. Same with the ram, it was twice the amount and at a faster frequency"
6894,The iPhone 6S was a champ! I’ve moved on now to a newer iPhone model but I still look back at the 6S fondly.
6895,"Back then there was also a compromise available for the people who didn’t want the large chassis. You could get the SE, with the power and most of the features of the 6s, but in the right-sized formfactor and beautiful chassis of the 5s"
6896,"Oh yes, that was the best Year ever. 

The spec of an 6s with a chassis of 5s. Just like the current SE 2020 i’m using. Thing is pretty darn powerful."
6897,"I now use the 2020 SE aswell, but it just made me realize how little I care about processor specs, etc. these days. Barely use my phone for anything more than typical PDA functionality, listening to music, typing messages and, well, calling people."
6898,"I had the iPhone 4s. It was a great phone when it came out, but I feel Apple pushed the software updates too far. By the time I upgraded, the iPhone 4s was slow to the point of unusable. 

The best iPhone in my opinion is the iPhone 11. It mixes good specs and a good price."
6899,"They sort of put themselves in that position. Half of the reason it supported iOS 9 was because the device was still sold in developing countries the year prior.  At the time they were proud of supporting their phones for at least two years from the shelf. Now because the processors are so much more powerful they don’t have a problem with that, but it played a large role in why it received the support"
6900,"I feel exactly the same way. I was amazed back then when they switched to iOS 9 and the clean, mature new-school interface design. But it wasn’t really a good user experience anymore"
6901,Serious question: what was the point of the 5c? I can’t remember at the time.
6902,"Because Apple didn’t want to sell the iPhone 5 for $100 with 2 year contract with the same exact design as the new 5S. 

Ditching the aluminum for plastic saved them about $26/phone. Everything else from the board to the cameras is almost the same as the 5. 

If Apple had kept selling the original iPhone 5 they would’ve sold far fewer 5Ss. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/iphone-5s-cost-make-199-iphone-5c-173-8C11256386"
6907,"**The 5C had a lot of changes and improvements over the 5!**

I saved this from several years ago:

-----


Really? Is this stuff now a secret? **The 5C was an improved, upgraded 5.**

* Compared to the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5C has an improved LTE radio and can support more bands.

iPhone 5: 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 17, 25

iPhone 5C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 38, 39, 40

* Compared to the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5C has an improved front-facing camera.

iPhone 5: 1.75µm pixel size

iPhone 5C: 1.9µm pixel size


* Compared to the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5C has a more durable body that is less likely to bend.

iPhone 5: aluminum

iPhone 5C: polycarbonate and steel


* Compared to the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5C has a larger battery - and even works with the iPhone 5S battery.

iPhone 5: 1440 mAh

iPhone 5C: 1510 mAh (supports up to 1560 mAh)

Also, the iPhone 5 was revised in mid-production.

The original iPhone 5 had a recall due to bad batteries, the iPhone 5C didn't.

The original iPhone 5 had a recall due to bad lock buttons, the iPhone 5C didn't.

The original iPhone 5 did not support all the frequencies used by T-Mobile (such as 1700 MHz), the iPhone 5C did.

The original iPhone 5 model was sold from September 2012 to April 2013.

The revised iPhone 5 model (serial number ending with FH19, FH1C, FH1D, FH1F, FH1G, FH1H) was released in April 2013. This one did not suffer from lock button issues, battery issues, and supported 1700 MHz.


If someone is buying a used iPhone 5, which model will they get?


If you go for the iPhone 5C, you don't have to worry about the lock button, battery, or frequency support."
6904,I loved the 5c and never had any issues with it. I’d stick longer with it but my model was only 16gb at the time.
6905,It was the iPhone SE of its time.  It filled the niche at the 'cheaper' end of the market.
6906,"Its actually worse than it, for the SE, it uses new specs but old design.

The 5C just uses the 5 internals, which is a gen older, plus they removed the aluminium frame for the colorful plastic."
6908,"It was also only $100usd cheaper than the 5s at the time, if I'm remembering correctly."
6909,"But normally the older generation is already $100 off.

So instead of getting the chamfered edges aluminium 5, I get the 5C for the same price, I think it’s a worse deal."
6910,"It's *because* the 5c was supposed to replace the 5. Almost the same exact internals, just with a cheaper looking shell.

I always thought it had something to do with the easily chipped slate color on the iPhone 5, but obviously that can't be true because there was also a white color that didn't chip as easily. Another commenter above mentioned that Apple just didn't want to sell the same exact looking device for $100 cheaper than the latest and greatest that was the 5S, so they ripped the guts out of an iPhone 5 and stuck it in a colorful plastic shell.

Edit: Also, as far as I know, they discontinued the iPhone 5 after the 5c was released."
6911,"I was a sales rep at T-Mobile when those came out and as far as I could tell, the c stood for children. Parents would always buy that one for their kids because of the price and then they got to choose some ugly colors.


Also I’ll vote for the iPhone 6 which I just replaced the other week for the new SE. that phone had the best value I’ve ever known in a phone given the years I had it."
6912,"I actually liked the colours. Now, a few years later, the XR and 11 have both been offered in a variety of fun colours. I was disappointed that they don’t offer that on their top end flagship the same way Android manufacturers have been doing. I wouldn’t have minded getting a white or blue XS Max."
6913,Best was the OG SE.
6914,SE was my first iPhone and it served me well for about three years until I got the 2020 SE. Battery started to fade (says 90% but barely makes it through the day) but otherwise great compact phone.
6915,Battery barely started to fade? Must have been lucky. I had my SE for 3 years aswell and in the end it would barely last me for the day. But now after switching to the SE 2 I realize how much I liked the SE.
6916,"Best: iPhone 4. It basically perfected the smartphone concept and took it from a slapdash, unrefined new thing and turned it into something we all can't live without. Other than antennagate it is the best phone ever made, period.

Worst: tough call between the 5c and the 6 / 6 Plus."
6917,Why not 4s? If I remember it had the widest band support at the time and came bundled with siri.
6918,Siri is trash right now with years of updates. With the 4S it was just a gimmick.
6919,"iPhone 6s for sure. It is still fast and zippy today and still being supported by Apple. 

The worst one would be the iPhone 6 and 6 plus. The bendgate issue really killed them. I replaced my iPhone 6 plus that time twice and it would still give me the ghost touch."
6920,"iPhone X is my favorite iPhone of al time, I love the silver on it and just the general design of it, I currently have the 11 and miss my X. 

Least favorite would probably be the 2016 SE. The Iphone 5 body is way too small for a 2016 phone"
6921,"Technically wouldn't the XS be the perfect distillation of everything you loved about the X, only with better innards and camera?"
6922,Wouldn’t the 11 pro be the same too? I mean the only different thing about the look of it is the camera but that doesn’t change the feel of the phone.
6923,No 3D Touch though
6924,"I’m glad to see the 6S is getting some love in this thread. It was one of the greatest iPhones ever and easily the most underrated. It was especially interesting because it came right after the iPhone 6, which was the worst iPhone ever. The 6S was visually the same, but boy was it ever different on the inside.


If I had to rank the flagship iPhones from best to worst, in terms of how impressive they were at the time of release, I’d go something like this:

**Tier 1:** iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone X

**Tier 2:** iPhone 5, iPhone 6S

**Tier 3:** iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, iPhone 7

**Tier 4:** iPhone 3GS, iPhone XS, iPhone 3G

**Tier 5:** iPhone 6

Those are also roughly in order of best to worst within each tier. I’m excluding the Max/Plus sizes as well as all the non-flagship models."
6926,"Keep in mind we’re speaking in relative terms, not absolute terms. It’s about how the phone was at the time of its release.

The iPhone X was a massive improvement over the previous year’s iPhone 7, in everything from design (full screen, Face ID, new gesture system) to the display (OLED) to the materials used (stainless steel rather than aluminum). It was also a big camera upgrade, a decent performance upgrade, and a nice improvement in battery life.

The XS offered none of that. It was the same design, the performance boost was minuscule (ie. the CPU gain was 15%, which is the smallest ever for an iPhone), and even the RAM felt limited. It increased from 3GB to 4GB, but it sure didn’t feel like it. If you compare the X and XS, the list of improvements is pretty paltry. Some of the ‘headline’ upgrades are the fact that it went from IP67 to IP68, and the fact that the Neural Engine was improved. Pretty minor stuff from a user’s point of view.

Also, the battery actually got *worse*, and in many ways, so did the camera. If you read the camera reviews, the XS wasn’t some incremental upgrade, but rather, the camera system was completely redesigned. And while this redesign helped a bit with low light photos, it also made everything flatter and more washed out. So even in absolute terms, it was worse in some ways.

Basically, the XS had two things going against it. Firstly, the improvements over the X were very minor, and secondly, in some cases, it actually got *worse* (battery life and daytime photography).

Taken together, owning an iPhone XS in 2018 was nowhere near as good an experience as owning an iPhone X in 2017. I’ve owned every flagship iPhone since the 4S in 2011, and the XS was the first and only time I actually regretted buying the new one. Looking back, I would have rather saved my money and gone another year with the X until picking up the 11 Pro.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a good phone (after all, it’s an iPhone), but if we’re ranking iPhones from best to worse, it’s definitely one of the least impressive releases."

Do you happen to know article/s which specifically point this out? I'd love to read more."
6928,"The controversy was largely around the new SmartHDR feature that was introduced with the XS. It had a tendency to create less natural images due to aggressive shadow brightening. This was especially bad on human skin since it flattened the texture by removing the shadows from your pores, giving a sort of skin smoothing effect."
6929,"Off the top of my head, I recall The Verge being particularly harsh on the camera. Nilay Patel was underwhelmed by it. Even though his review was okay, he had some fairly harsh words to say on podcasts and in interviews.

The general impression I got at the time from tech reviews was that the X’s camera was very good and well-rounded, but disappointing in that the iPhone lost the crown of best camera to the Pixel. And then the XS tried to regain that crown by pushing to offer better low light performance, but then it sacrificed other aspects in the process, like color and vibrancy. So the XS camera was less well-rounded than the X camera was.

That’s the subjective impression I got from reading several reviews in 2017 and 2018. The Verge was one of them, but there were several others with similar views (off hand, I don’t remember which)."
6930,I think the iPhone 7 Plus deserve to be in tiers 2 because it has introduced the portrait mode and the water resistance
6931,"For me it’s the 11 Pro simply because of the battery. 

I had the X, and Xs and this phones battery life is almost double. 

It was a game changer for how much I use my phone."
6932,"My fav is everything with 5 chassis. Never liked any of the 6/6S/7/8/SE2. Only got replacement for 5S last year, when i replaced it with X."
6933,"Worst was the 6. I know everyone had one, but they just weren’t very good. The best one was probably the X, although I personally liked the 5c even if it wasn’t technically that good."
6934,The 5C is the worst iPhone ever made. The cheap plastic made it just a re-skinned iPhone 5. Wasn’t a fan of it.
6935,"If I've learned anything from this thread, it's that everyone has their own opinion, and no two are alike."
6936,"The best is both the iPhone 4 and iPhone X, as I do think both set a lot of standards for what we think of as a “smartphone”, both in terms of design and performance. 

Both are packed to the brim with features that while not exactly new, were the catalyst for becoming main stays, as well as new technological innovations that remain unmatched for years. Both also set the standard for the next decade of design (the 5 and 6-8 all build upon the original design of the 4, just how the 11 and 12 (and future iPhones) are evolutions of the X).

The worst is the XS because, I mean, it’s the XS."
6938,"You’ve pretty much got it right. 

My fav iPhone though is definitely the iPhone 6."
6939,iPhone 6 series sucked! Has bend gate etc! Anything from the iPhone X up I’d say is a great phone and will last you years! The iPhone XS series is a amazing series just as the 11 the iPhone 11 series will be supported alittle longer than them all and the A13 will last longer!
6941,"My favourites: iPhone 4, 5, 6s, X, 11/Pro

My contenders for worst: iPhone 5c and iPhone 6/6+"
6942,"my worst is 5-5s has so manny quality issues that not worth the price for me...

the best is 7 i rock now and up versions..."
6943,"The 6 series was the absolute worst and it isn't even close (imo of course). The 5c was a phone I wanted to like. If only it didn't have the outdated innards.

I wish we had more plastic phones."
6944,"Best: iPhone X

Worst: iPhone 5C"
6945,People seem to hate the 5c. I had one for 2 and a half years and it's been one of my favourite iphones I've had.
6946,Any home button iPhone 6-8 that’s not the plus feels weak
6947,"Best: 6S. I’m a fan headphones jacks and 3D touch. 

Worst: Probably the 3G."
6948,"Why the 3G? For its time it brought so much like 3G networking, faster speeds and a new design. Probably the 5C was the worst. Basically a skinned iPhone 5."
6949,"For me, 3G, faster speed and a new design were not “so much”. The plastic case was a bug let down and I wanted GPS. Seemed like a step back to me. 

Although the loss of headphone jack and 3D touch were much bigger steps backward IMO."
6950,"Best: iPhone 5/5S. The form, feel, and having a home button. Favorite iPhone to this day and I miss Touch ID.

Not sure about the worst.

Edit: the 5 didn’t have Touch ID."
6951,(iPhone 5 didn’t have Touch ID)
6952,You’re right. Typo.
6953,"Best is probably the newest one but for me it’s my current iPhone X because I don’t have the iPhone 11 Pro Max 😕

I don’t have a worst iPhone as they have all be great at that point in time when I had them."
6954,iPhone X is the best iPhone
6955,I agree with you on the worst. I had three 5c phones and each of them had to be returned for an expanding battery.
6956,"Best: SE (1. Gen)
Worst: 7

The SE had that beautifully industrial, angled, premium feeling glass and aluminium design with the perfect sized chassis. 

The 7 on the other hand is too big and the chassis has a boring rounded design and cheap feeling plastic on the outside. Also it’s missing an actual tactile home button and a headphone jack. Basically the same criticism can be applied to all generations that came afterwards. 

I don’t really care about the processor specs and so on since I don’t use my phone to play games and such. I just want an iPhone that COMFORTABLY fits into my pants pockets."
6957,"Best - iPhone 7 

Worst - iPhone 5c"
6958,"6S plus is by far the best iphone, i changed the battery of my 6S plus last year and it’s performing like a champ"
6959,"Best iphone: 6/6s 

Worst iphone: 5c

Even tho i’ve never owned an 6/6s they seemed like such massive changes and leaps forward."
6960,"Best for it’s time either the original iPhone  ( game changing ) or the iPhone 4 ( better design imo and display than anything else at the time ).

Worst... I’d say iPhone 7 due to sub par battery life even when it was new, it became dire after a year or so."
6961,"I kinda liked the 5C since my first iPhone was the 3G and it kinda made me feel nostalgic. Other than that, it was a pretty bad miss. 

For me the worst iPhone was the iPhone 7. It didn’t had the headphone jack, no real upgrades compared to the 6S and they did the planned obsolescence thing on that device. 

The best iPhone IMO is the iPhone XS, since it checked all boxes for me:

-	Smaller design
-	Modern look (Face ID, notchless)
-	OLED display
-	Affordable during 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max release
-	Decent battery life
-	Second (and more improved) generation X device"
6962,">they did the planned obsolescence thing on that device.

How, exactly? The current base iPad is using the same processor as the 7 (A10) and the T2 coprocessors in Macs use cores that were derived from the A10 as well. 

>no real upgrades compared to the 6S

The 7+ was the first iPhone to feature a telephoto lens. This was big at the time because every iPhone before it had only featured a single lens.

How exactly was the 7 ""bad""?"
6963,"The whole battery thing on the older devices, if I’m correct they crippled the iPhone 7 too and only offered cheap replacements when they were caught. I’m not buying the official statement on that.

I’m talking about the 7, not 7 Plus. It basically only had a new Taptic Engine. Everything else was just same old (and of course a new A-chip but that happens yearly)."
6965,"The whole “battery gate” issue is way overblown. Apple introduced that feature in iOS 10 because they were getting increased reports of older iPhone batteries failing in some manner. Instead of having to issue a mass recall (which would have cost Apple hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially damaged their brand) Apple instead opted to fix the issue through software by throttling older iPhones down to the point where the power issues were resolved and the phones were still more than useable. After blowback, Apple gave users the ability to flip a switch and turn this feature off. I personally think it was a smart move by Apple in order for them to avoid a Note 7 disaster on a potentially larger scale.

Or, we can go with the oft repeated theory that Apple is intentionally trying to force people to upgrade their phones. Personally, one of these sounds plausible while the others sounds more like a bunch of disgruntled customers coming up with their own ideas."
6966,"I've been echoing this exact thought for years. ""Apple is slowing down my phone for no reason... And it's weird my phone hasn't shut down at 30% battery, but my battery health is still at 64% I don't need an upgrade!"""
6967,"Dunno about the worst, but my favourite is probably the iPhone 5S."
6968,"Best: iPhone SE

Worst: 3G"
6969,"Best: iPhone 11 Pro. Great design, best battery life. 

Worst: iPhone SE 2020. Gets too much credit than deserved. I’m not fond of its battery life."
6970,"Honestly the SE 2020 Is a great device for parents to get their kids for a first phone. If parents have an iPhone, they'd want their kids to probably stay in the same OS as well"
6971,First Iphone worst. Latest best 😂😂😂😂😂.
25959,r/technicallythetruth
6974,"Everyone hating here on the 5c, but it‘s seriously the best work phone for 30€ I have bought. If I‘m stressed I can throw it across the room and it‘ll still work!"
6975,">If I‘m stressed I can throw it across the room and it‘ll still work!

Maybe, but I'd count yourself very lucky if that was the case. Facts are that plastic is an inherently weaker material than aluminum or stainless steel, which made the iPhone 5c one of the weakest iPhones built to date. I severely doubt that most people could just chuck a plastic phone across a room and *not* have it crack somewhere."
6976,and happy cake day!!!
6977,"I would just put that on the manufacturing (process) of the 5c. Outside of the old school Blackberries, the most durable (and best feeling) phone that I've ever used was the Nokia Lumia 1520. That things has been dropped so many times from different heights and the only thing it has to show for it is a few scuffs here and there. I wish Apple would use the same manufacturing process that Nokia used for the 1520. One could wish"
6978,"I‘ve done it like 4 times and that happened was the screen popping out a bit and some dents in the plastic. Still works fine for everything that it has to do. So that would be checking mail and getting calls.
I mean, you can‘t go wrong with it for 30€"
6979,"worst: iPhone 3G and iPhone 6 Plus (both got super slow and crashy after about a year)

best: every iPhone since 6S. Long lasting, durable devices that are simply in a league of their own"
6980,"Best: 6S

Worst: 6 and 7

6 because it's so underpowered and imo 6S specs should be inside it,

7 because of real home button and 3,5mm jack removal while not adding any good features"
6981,"I wanted to buy the iPhone 11 but I bought the 11 Pro because of the size, oled, and thinner bezels."
6982,OLED is like crack. Never going back
6983,OLED doesn’t play nice with my eyes. I prefer LCD. I’ve got an iPhone 11 and a Xiaomi Mi 9T(OLED) and I prefer the iPhone display.
6984,What do you mean? Is it like that weird irritation some people get with black lights?
6985,Some people are affected by the frequency oled screens flash in comparison to lcd.
6986,"I think it's because OLED usually uses PWM dimming and it can irritate some people, but his phone can also do DC dimming so we will see if it helps him."
6987,"There's also some inconsistencies in quality, my X panel is slightly dimmer along the right edge. I think the removal of 3D touch also gave the bottom flex cables and batteries more space."
6988,"This has nothing to do with his post.

But yes, all X models had this issue. It's only there when you actually bother to notice it though. OCD always fucks me on things like that too, so I know exactly why this irritates you.

What hurts even more is that my OnePlus 7 Pro cost £300 less, but has the first OLED screen I've seen thats close to perfect as I'll ever get when it comes to evenness.... BUT I had to go through 3 devices, all for various faults, to get this.

Apple devices have never been known for consistent screen quality though."
6989,"I have the Mi 9T Pro version, but for this they are the same - LCD displays have DC dimming which hasn't been available on OLED until now, and the Mi 9T has it as well.

Go into Settings > Display > Anti-Flicker mode = ON

This will likely fix your problem if it was irritating your eyes before."
6990,"I don’t have that option sadly, I even tried searching it. 

Thank you for your suggestion anyhow!"
6991,"Are you on MIUI 11? 

Actually I just read that some people don't have it yet on the K20, which is essentially the same phone - but stay on the lookout because all models *should get it soon*!"
6992,"I am indeed, still waiting for Android 10 as well. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. 

Thanks again :)"
6993,only Mi 9T Pro has DC dimming option in settings
6994,"OLED and eye strain greatly depends on the PWM controller. This year’s iPhone Pro models have a better controller than the XS models, which already were like three solid generations ahead of top end Android flagships of today (Note 10 is eye strain hell).

I’d be surprised if a fucking Xiaomi had a better PWM controller than a Note 10, and that already has an atrocious controller

I’ve had my Pro Max for more than a month now and whenever I look at a Note 10 my eyes instantly hurt, it’s safe to say you’re comparing lobster thermidor to a five year old mcdonald’s hamburger"
6995,"As others have said though, newer Xiaomi phones have DC dimming on their OLED devices, and OnePlus has it on their 7 and 7T series."
6996,"I love OLED, but the screen on my iPad Pro (10.5 inch, haven't seen any newer ones in person) is the best display I've ever seen. I would buy a ProMotion LCD iPhone over an OLED one"
6997,"OnePlus 7 Pro's 90hz OLED screen, the ASUS ROG's 120hz OLED screen, are the only devices with a better screen that I've found so far.

The iPad Pro 11"" my OH owns has a gorgeous display too, but even at 120hz the slow response times of IPS screens are very obvious.

Its the same on my 144hz IPS monitor, ghosting and trails when scrolling or fast moving content is on screen. Like I can scroll fast on the OnePlus and text is still solid and readable, but on the iPad and my monitor it turns into a blurry fluid mess."
6998,I prefer white performance on the iPhone LCD.
6999,"Same, even the best LCD screen seems washed out after using OLED."
7000,"Not really. I've used X for a year, then Xs Max for another, now im using a normal 11, and I have absolutely no problems with the LCD."
7001,"I disagree. While OLED on my Xs Max looks pretty darn good, the black smearing is there, and, for me it has been increasingly annoying. At first it was the Apple Watch app, and now it’s the whole OS with Dark Mode.

I know you can deactivate Dark Mode but that kinda defeats the purpose of OLED. At first I thought it was a bug with my specific unit but can’t unsee that smearing anymore, going as far as having thoughts about switching to an LCD iPhone when this one retires, but that telephoto would have me on the fence.

edit: typo"
7002,"I got the 128gb iPhone 11 because the 256GB 11 Pro Max (11 Pro is too small for me) is a solid $800 more expensive here in Canada and I can't justify that price, as much as I love OLED having used Samsung phones in the past. For me it's not about affording it, but justifying paying that much more for it.

I've gotten used to the bezels at this point."
7003,"Literally exactly what I did, for the same reasons. And in the same currency... but not the part about being able to afford it. 

Coming from a 7, it’s a gigantic upgrade anyway. Really happy with it so far!"
7004,"I want the 11 Pro something fierce and could—with slight difficulty—probably manage to make the base model work cost wise with trading in my current phone. But I’d be in for $1200 because Apple insists on making 64GB the new standard and 128 is the sweet spot for me. 

The price delta between the 11 128 and the 11 Pro 256 just hurts. If Apple had made the 11 Pro 128/256/512 then goodness I’d be all over it."
7005,If you have a membership with Costco you can get $100 off and get the pro for $1050 I believe
7006,"I’d consider this but after selling both my XR and Note 9 I was going to put the leftover balance on my credit card and I don’t think Costco takes anything but Visa and my card’s a MasterCard. :/

Maybe I’ll just wait for prices on the secondhand market to come down a wee bit. I know T-Mobile has decent deals too but the idea of shackling myself to them for another two years is something I’d rather not do."
7007,I would have gone with Xs Max in your case. That's what I did when I was deciding to upgrade to X.
7008,"True, but the camera and battery upgrades were a big factor for me."
7009,Me too. I love this phone. Coming from a pixel 2
7010,"Finally sucked it up and let go of my little iPhone SE: can confirm, I fucking love this phone."
7011,"I’m using the iPhone 11. As much as I like it, the size is a little too big for me. Often have hard times reaching for the bottom left of the screen…"
7012,The pro is smaller.
7013,I know. Much more expensive though. But if you let me choose again I would probably go for the Pro.
7014,I did buy the 11 because I didn’t care about any of those things and it was fine - but I also exchanged it for the 11 Pro because I found I missed the tele lens.
7015,"I don’t understand the big deal regarding OLED when the Macs and iPads we use all day aren’t OLED either. It’d be one thing if every Apple product was OLED, THEN it would be weird to buy an LCD iPhone, but most screens are LCD."
7016,"Why would it be weird? OLED screens at the size of the iPad & Macs are waaaaay more expensive than LCD relative to the jump between phone screens to OLED from LCD.

If Apple had a supplier that could make enough OLED panels for Mac/iPad at the same price jump that they went with for the iPhone, both products would have OLED options."
7018,"I mean the side bezels are a little much, but look at the forehead and chin combo on the new pixels. THOSE are bezels."
7019,"The chin is the same size as the iPhone 11's, but the side bezels are a fraction of the width, even slimmer than the Pro's."
7020,First I’ve realised the 11 Pro was slightly smaller than the 11! Bezels should’ve been a clue..
7022,I’m betting it’s mostly because of the name change
7023,"Yep. The iPhone 11 is seen as the iPhone for everyone and anyone. 

The iPhone XR was seen as a budget iPhone. 

The name can have a significant effect on the product, especially for Apple where it relies on its name so much."
7024,Kinda funny though since the launch price of XR was higher than the 11.
7025,"The bashing was mainly about the display. Once report came out of how well the XR was the best selling phone of 2019, critics just said the display didn’t matter much to buyers. 

Now that the 11 came with 4GB-RAM, extra cam, slightly better water resistant, slightly bigger battery to the XR left very little room for hate. Plus the 11 launch price is $50 cheaper than the XR launch price."
7026,isn't it at $699? That's a $50 drop.
7027,"Yeah, you’re right. I thought of the XR being $100 cheaper right now."
7029,That too
7030,"Who cares what idiots say?  I use an XR and get all my shit done all day with battery life to spare.  Text is readable and smooth.  If I had an OLED screen, I would STILL use my phone to get shit done, not ""play on"".  People say they ""can't live"" without OLED.  I go between my iPad Pro 10.5 with 120 hz screen and incredible color, and my 60hz iPhone XR and you know how much my days suffers? Exactly zero.

Anyone who thinks they ""can't go back"" to LCD is a goddamn snowflake.  If your phone is not a tool for you, your phoning wrong.

I'm not some gamer kid on a bus.  I use it to navigate to jobs, provide internet to my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, and listen to podcasts and the other regular phone stuff like communicating and scheduling etc

People are idiots.  Any next gen phone these days is a hair split from the previous."
7031,In my opinion people shit on the 11’s display way too much. It’s still very good.
7032,I can’t even tell the difference. I guess my eyes are getting blurry.
7033,"Blurry is one thing, but can you not see the difference between grey and black?"
7034,"Tech media and tech Youtubers couldn’t bash the 11 after the XR became the best selling iPhone of 2019 Q1, Q2 and Q3. The XR shut a lot people up who were trashing the display but the sales showed people didn’t care. Plus the XR battery life won people over too.

The 11 has an extra RAM, extra cam, slightly better battery and launched $50 cheaper than the XR launch price. Critics couldn’t really bash the 11 cuz they know it’ll sell like crazy."
7035,$50 cheaper.
7036,"You’re correct, I think I got it confused with the XR being $100 cheaper now."
7037,"The 11 has a comparable camera and launched at a lower price than the XR.. so yeah, of course they do."
7038,"The XR had the same main camera as the XS, like the 11 from the 11 Pro. But it's just a 50$ difference really."
7039,I personally think that the current lineup with their pricing is really well balanced. Last year felt like more of a clusterfuck to me. The XR fits in better now than it did last year IMO.
7040,I went for the 11 because of price based what you get.  Its cheaper then the pro and almost there in functionality.
7041,"My mother and wife got the 11 and love it. It really is the best phone for most people. Unless size, screen, or an extra camera is something you need, the 11 is an amazing phone.

And for reference, my mother had an iPhone 6, my wife an iPhone 6s Plus."
7042,"Don‘t forget space. For some reason there isn‘t a 512 GB version of the non-Pro iPhone. I like to have my whole music collection with me and use the iPhone as an audio player / DAP and that was the only reason I had to opt for the Pro version. Well, I also preferred the smaller size."
7043,"If that is the amount of music you save on your phone, why don’t you just get spotify or apple music? I’ve had a 64GB phone for over 2 years now and i’m not even at 50% yet."
7044,"Because there‘s lots of music, particularly rare and old releases, not available on streaming services."
7045,You can upload I guess 100000 songs on Apple Music.
7047,"God forbid people add details that don‘t match your particular experience. You may as well replace music with other media like photos or video. A requirement of up to 512 GB is certainly not the norm, but also not unreasonable in 2019."
7048,If it had an OLED display I'd buy it. That's a feature I absolutely can't live without after being on Android the last couple of years.
7049,Meanwhile I hope they never stop making non-OLED phones.
7050,Why? Rumour recently suggests the successor to 11 will be oled in 2020. Probably inaccurate though.
7051,The smearing (at least on the XS) was very noticeable in low-light situations. I’ll take greyish blacks over smearing while scrolling any day of the week.
7052,"As an owner of a Kuro, who is aware it won't last forever, what is this smearing you speak of? In 2019 OLED has issues like this?"
7053,"Don't ask, once you see it you might never unsee it."
7054,"I’ve made short films and things, so I’d probably notice if I owned one. Might get me of off my phone late at night, haha. Or can this also be seen in daylight?"
7055,"Smearing can be seen by reducing brightness and using a dark theme. Scrolling on Reddit right now clauses smearing. In sunlight it's fine 

Not a massive issue but it's not great."
7056,I see what you mean now. Is this an oled limitation or a display driver engine programming issue?
7057,It must be the time limitation of the oleds turning on once white is detected. Maybe 120hz screens will fix it or most likely MicroLED
7059,I’ve swapped from OLED to LCD back and forth since 2014 and still don’t mind it. I’m starting to realize I’m more of the typical consumer than I’d like to admit. Even downgrading from “Very High” quality to “Normal” on Spotify I can’t hear a distinct difference.
7060,"Regarding Spotify audio quality, pretty much no one can unless they’re wearing high end headphones listening to music they are very familiar with

inb4 “but i can totally hear the difference with my $5 earbuds listening to k-pop”"
7061,"I noticed a difference when I first switched to the Xr last year, but quickly adjusted. Still a nice panel, despite the lower resolution."
7063,">	I switched from the Note 8 to the 11 and can't tell much of a difference between the screens.

Big LOL from me on that, bud."
7064,"Me too. I went for the Pro *primarily* because the iPhone 11 is just too big for me (though I recognise there's a huge market for big phones anyway), but the screen quality is also an issue given I was coming from the 1440p OLED display on the Galaxy S8. I *could* notice the drop in quality from that. The stainless steel frame, frosted back, and telephoto lens are also cool."
7065,Fuck me I just bought an  11 Pro and didn't even look at the 11. How much bigger are they? I went with the pro mainly because of the OLED and the camera for when I travel.
7066,"Pro is 5.8 inches, 11 is 6.1, and the Pro Max is 6.4 or 6.5."
7067,I get headaches with oled
7069,"Crap, I’m real sensitive to flicker- I can SEE it with any monitor under 70hz."
7070,"How do you manage with phones then? Till very recently nothing went above 60Hz, and it's all a lot closer to your eyes..."
7071,"Well, most have persistency of image. In a CRT and some lcds you have the light actually going on and off very fast. So it really depends and is less and less of an issue because modern tech doesn’t strobe (change light levels)."
7072,Can I ask why? I use both an 11 pro max and an 8+ daily and don’t see the big hoopla over the oled
7073,"Much higher contrast ratio, pure blacks, better viewing angles, incredible HDR content viewing. And that’s just a few."
7074,"I guess I just don’t notice it making that big of a difference. Yeah the true blacks are nice for watching video but outside of that, it doesn’t really wow me over the lcd. Its definitely not the huge difference like when looking at a big lcd to oled tv. At least for me"
7075,I’m with you. Upgraded from the 8+ to an 11 Pro Max and don’t really notice any benefit from the OLED screen.
7076,The bezels are a benefit you notice every time though..
7077,Also the response time of the pixels it way faster than any LCD on any device.
7079,"\> PWM flicker

Which doesn't affect everyone.

\> black smearing

Yup, 100% an issue.

\> poor low brightness colour accuracy (especially greys)

Yup.

\> muddy-looking bright colours

Absolutely no idea what you're talking about

\> image retention and burn-in

Honest question: have there been many cases of image retention or burn-in on the X/Xs/11 Pro? I'd imagine Reddit of all places would be swamped with complaints, but I can't remember seeing any complaints and I, personally, haven't seen these issues."
7080,"I’m sure Apple has included some software trickery to minimize the amount of time display elements are kept in the same spot, considering the status bar at the top, etc. 

Also, Apple sources high quality displays for their iPhones, both in terms of LCDs and OLEDs. I imagine the higher end screens are a bit less susceptible to burn in.

Source: replaced a screen on my old iPhone 5s with a third party. That screen was *very* inferior."
7081,"You can do DC dimming on OLED, Apple just doesn't.. just like they don't do Always On Display, despite doing it on the watch."
7082,"blacks are actually black, not dark grey."
7083,"The added contrast and ""true"" black is something I don't really want to live without.  Especially with dark mode.  It's much more significant than a trivial upgrade IMO."
7084,Legit no one can tell the difference outside of Reddit.
7085,And people with eyes..
7086,"Got the iPhone 11 Pro. Didn’t even know it had an OLED, coming from other Apple devices. 

You and I have very different priorities."
7087,What are your priorities that made you go for the Pro then? The telephoto?
7088,"Honestly? I hadn’t upgraded in awhile and I’d never had a “top of the line” iPhone. However, my largest “excitements” were the larger battery/better battery life (this has been huge) as well as the improvements to the camera(s). The wideangle is more exciting that the telephoto, honestly. Just wish it had RAW support."
7089,Lol at the comments treating you like an outsider when like 90% of iPhone customers are in the same boat and not peeping specs like we do on this sub
7090,"I think more importantly for the Telephoto would be night mode, and also they should have night mode on the XS models.. but that would get less people to upgrade.

I'm guessing they don't allow RAW on the ultrawide because they want to be the ones to do the distortion correction.

Although I shoot all the images in RAW+JPG on my android, I don't edit them as much as I do with my Mirrorless, but it is nice to know that I can fix things in post if it is an important photo. Also, I guess it is nice that an Android RAW isn't really the same as a standard RAW because it still uses the HDR+ median blend image (smart HDR on Apple) and gives you that without the extra corrections to color / noise / sharpness."
7092,"I said my “excitements,” I didn’t say “the reason I chose the Pro over the standard.” 

Also, another one, the green glass. I love that."
7093,"Have a X, but planning on getting the 11 in the next couple weeks. While I like the OLED display the old display is high quality, and I when I scroll the OLED screen can’t keep up as much as the older tech. Once the refresh rate increases I will give OLED a try again!"
7094,They are the same refresh rate and OLED has much faster pixel switching.. so I don't see how that's possible.
7095,I don’t even care about the OLED to be honest. If the 11 came with a high res display I would have gotten it over the 11PM that I ended up with.
7096,"You could live without it, you just choose not to."
7097,"Wow that's very helpful insight, thanks."
7098,"Trying to decide between the iPhone 11 and Pro right now. Not sure how I feel about OLED I wouldn't say I need it, but the extra battery life from it would be nice and my main reason for upgrading. Don't really need the extra camera, and the smaller size would be nice since i'm upgrading to get rid of the 6s+ size I have right now, but i've also heard it's ""too small"" as well. Seems to be bigger than my relatives iPhone 6 tho and that's what i'd consider too small these days."
7099,If you have the money and will keep it for many years go for the pro
7100,The 11/XR strike an excellent balance with the size. It’s bigger than the plus size screens but smaller overall because of the bezel and chin reduction. I’d say go for the 11 and use the extra money you save to get either Apple Watch or AirPods.
7101,"I still get a thrill thinking about when Verge rated the Note 7 higher than the iPhone for the first time, right before it exploded"
7102,"I mean, except for exploding, it was probably the best phone of that time."
7103,"While true, they rated it the best phone so long as it didn't explode."
7105,"Don’t know what you’re talking about, getting eaten by a crocodile is the best part"
7106,"“The garden is beautiful but the walls grow ever higher” lol. I actually like the walled garden and see it as a plus in my opinion. Less fragmentation, a unified ecosystem. All of Apples products work seamlessly together. I don’t get the criticism against Apples closed system."
7107,The walls have shrunk massively especially with Siri Shortcuts.
7108,I swear they say that in every review
7109,"If only the macbooks were priced more reasonably I would’ve had a full apple lineup right now, but the base 13 inch without discrete graphics (which i need) was 600 euros more expensive than the huawei matebook 13 I ended up getting. For that extra 600 I got myself an awesome pair of Bose QC 35 headphones and a trip to italy."
7110,"I mean, the iPhone 11 is $400 more than the Mi 9T Pro too.. which is a far larger relative difference in price."
7111,"Yes but i really don’t enjoy the android experience, while i can survive windows. Also the dedicated gpu, the 1440p 4:3 aspect ratio is a big in my book and a normal keyboard are a big win."
7112,"Matebook are not available everywhere and don’t have tb3 for those who needs it. 

Also, sluggish windows + telemetry + breaking updates

Upcoming MacBook 13 update (likely back to school) would be interesting - possibly 13.9 like mxp and double storage"
7113,">also sluggish windows

Windows has been sluggish and laggy on every device i’ve tried. I currently need to do a bunch of cad work so I’m tied to windows. Once i can uninstall solidworks i’ll probably dual boot linux again."
7114,"I think the biggest con is that apple can just delete a bunch of apps from the app store because they ""didn't fit their regulations"" or some bullshit (like the vaping apps recently) and you can't do shit about it"
7115,"All of Apples products could *still* work seamlessly together, there would just be competition.

The criticism is that no competition in the ecosystem is why the phones are priced so high, why 128Gb of storage costs a hundred and so on."
7116,"But there is competition, it’s called Android!"
7117,I thought the jump from 64gb to 128gb was $50
7118,"That is indeed how math works.

64 to 128 = 64Gb for $50

128 to 256 = 128Gb for $100

Except even worse, for the Pros it is $150 for 128Gb"
7119,They decided you can’t use vape apps randomly so now you can’t control them using your iPhone
7120,"I’ve always looked around the walled garden and shrugged, even over a decade ago. Why? Everything I needed was inside and most of what I wanted was inside also. 

I still recall getting to know Apple when I bought my first PowerBook back in 2002. As I started gathering apps I had fear about the walled garden I had heard of and indeed I saw the options were limited where Windows seemed endless... then as I found the bits I needed and located most of what I wanted, the fear eased."
7121,Start using iOS 13. You'll know.
7122,Know what?
7123,How unstable iOS now is. Bugs are all around. Every gesture brings forth a potential bug.
7125,"I'm currently typing on a OnePlus 7T with an iPhone right next to me. I can say this unequivocally because I use both devices, Android 10 is way, way more stable than iOS 13. Oxygen OS (a skin of Android 10 which runs on all OnePlus devices), reminds me of iOS 6. It's that good. It's ridiculous how quickly the standards have fallen for Apple."
7126,"I currently have an X but want to change to something newer. The 11 feels heavy and the bezels really stick out to me for some reason. I tried the 11 Pro but couldn't stand the different material on the back, it was like a bar of soap, and I never use cases. It also felt too heavy compared to the X.

I'll either stick to my X or try an 11, the ""SE 2"" is also appealing to me for next year, I really prefer Touch ID."
7127,"Problem for me is there just wasn’t enough of a difference really (and my X still works well). I really, really want a Pro motion display. I’m really hope the rumors for the 12 are true, cause that will make me upgrade."
7128,"yeah the 11 pro felt identical to my X, except heavier, more difficult to grip because of the backside frosted glass, and a better camera, with a big price tag. The camera isn't very important to me. So I returned it."
7129,Battery life from my X to 11 Pro was so nice of an upgrade
7130,"Yeah can understand that for sure. For my use, the X still lasts me all day (and more, most days), unless I'm working out of pocket which is usually several times a year to be honest - and always near power."
7131,I’d actually love to see them take the exact form factor of the SE and make it an all-screen LED display. That would be basically the ideal tiny phone imo
7132,"LED, LCD or OLED?"
7133,"""I currently have an 10"" man that's so weird to read."
7134,"I have the exact opposite experience with the 11 pro. I think the back finish has way more grip

It felt too heavy too. I got used to it, but the battery life is just so worth it"
7135,"Interesting. I felt like at certain times of the day it was easier to grip, depending on the 'condition' of my hands lol like right after a shower or washing my hands I couldn't hold the damn thing at all. When my hands were more clammy during the day it was easier. The heaviness I didn't like but I probably could have learned to live with. Glad you're enjoying it though!"
