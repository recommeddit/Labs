39131,It is using a modified version of uBlock actually
39134,"Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of suggestions for Edge, which took me by surprise considering I've been avoiding it like the plague since the system started shoving it into all the built-in systems.
Kind of interesting how many suggestions there are eventhough so far I haven't gotten anything concrete aside from Edge and ""Brave"" (Which I never heard of before)"
39135,"I use Opera and Brave. Opera is like a mix from chrome and firefox it's fast like chrome and cool loking like Firefox. They updated it. It looks completely different than it used to. I haven't used Brave much, but it's a privacy browser and it looks cool"
39136,Opera GX has a RAM and CPU limiter feature afaik. Maybe that could be interesting to you.
39137,Edge and Brave Browser.
39138,As far as I know is vanilla de-googled Chromium.
39139,I use Firefox. It does not eat up too much Ram and from what I have experienced they are focused on user privacy and don't scam all your info.
39140,IIRC google donated 500 mil to the mozilla foundation. I wouldn't be so sure they aren't ganking your info. That being said...superior browser
39141,"I love firefox, I have all my shortcut on it and it syncs on my phone and my other computers automatically, can also send link between a lot of device including my phone. It's a pleasure to use, privacy focused, fast enough for me, and can do a lot of stuff, still keep Chrome in the side for really specific usage (Netflix and Google Earth Studio) but if you don't care about those, don't hesitate, use Firefox. It feels like an apple ecosystem."
39142,"I use Firefox most the time, but I also have a copy of [Falkon](https://www.falkon.org/). It is built on the Qt WebEngine which is a wrapper for the Chromium browser core. Built by KDE for Windows and Linux. It's lightweight and fast."
39143,"I Use Firefox have been for years, in my opinion its allot better then Chrome or any chrome Clone.

Good thing about Firefox is it 100% open Source and always Updated they fix Security issues fast."
39144,"Brave or Degoogled Chromium, maybe Edge."
39145,"I was using only Chrome for about 4+ years but some months ago i decided to switch to opera gx cause of the ads.... And now i am stuck with it, cant change back, it has exactly what i needed in a  browser..... 
Also lately i got into VMs so i have been using some TOR & Firefox, they make me feel uncomfortable going back and forth but privacy comes first"
39146,I am using Chrome from more than 6 years now it's good if you are using windows try Edge it's best option with windows and work smother than chrome..try it for a week you will see the difference
39147,"If you want chromium based browsers go for the new edge or brave( they are a more polished faster, more optimized, more privacy, more modern, and more feature rich browser than shitty chrome.) If you want an open source browser go for firefox its great. Im currently using a dual browser set up and use edge when im just surfing the web and firefox when im gaming."
39148,Brave. Never had any issues and runs smooth.
39149,"According to this, its chromium edge (yeah I didnt expect that either)

[https://www.pcworld.com/article/3213031/best-web-browsers.html?page=2](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3213031/best-web-browsers.html?page=2)

but ... eeew :(

Honestly you're better off just biting the bullet on a new battery. You probably know this already though: Cheapest place is ebay. They are usually easy to fit. Messing about with software can only give you diminishing gains."
39151,microsoft browsers have always been so far behind the development curve its not funny. Amazingly bad by comparison with alternatives for many many years. Nice to see they are pulling their fingers out with this offering.
39152,Lmao all those browsers except for Firefox are based on chromium; they won't consume less ram. The only thing you can really do is use ublock origin to block resource-hogging ads and maybe even disable javascript on some sites
39153,"I already do that, it works to a certain extent but it’s not cutting it anymore. So the main issue is with Chromium? Even if they are supposedly lightweight options?"
39154,"Brave Browser is a really solid browser that has built-in ad/tracker blocking, with an opt-in ad platform that pays you in crypto."
39155,"Brave browser + DuckDuckGo for a search engine.  They also have a partnership.  Very privacy focused, both teams with really great missions and ideals."
39156,Brave Browser + DuckDuckGo ;)
39157,Thanks man.. DuckDuckGo is surely a good search engine
39158,"I started to use it some months ago.
Really nice!"
39159,have you subsribe to their paid service? is it worth getting the 3 years subs rather than the monthly?
39160,"I was not aware about a subscription...
Advantages?"
39161,"well they have three options for their subs: Basic, Standard and the Professional.

39162,Thx I will take a look at it 😉
39163,Using Opera + DuckDuckGo on my laptop and phone for the past two years.
39164,"Opera, I've been testing for a while Vivaldi but it's some kind of buggy.

Opera for me it's the fastest, open quickly, browse quickly and I'm using a lot of extensions so its the right in my opinion"
39165,how about the privacy on it? does it also do the thing like google chrome or other browsers out there?
39166,"I think we can not avoid that we use ""free"" products and the coin exchange it's our data (personal behavior) but we can decide -setup what settings we can let them see and what other they mustn't have from us.

Every website have tracking cookies: Google analytics cookies, comScore cookies, omniture cookies, Adobe analytics cookies, double click ad cookies...... So you're afraid of the browser but every page you visit it's collecting info from us.

In other hand, you don't use chrome but you use Gmail...it's the same thing.. you're part of their third party data for ads.

You don't use chrome but you use extension from chrome webstore or extensions from Firefox store. It's the same, you let them collect some information within the extension

I think you need to search / decide what browser let you work fluently smooth with your browsing habits. That it doesn't kill your computer/laptop from a lack of memory or high cpu process because of the amount of tabs.

I was a big a fan of Firefox but it started to kill every machine I used because it was a great consumer of resources

I've tried Vivaldi, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave

Vivaldi it's my personal hope  that they can  fix  the buggy and slow issues they have to become my default browser. The custom GUI, the web panels ( a floating version of a Mwebsite in the side bar of the browser) and the extension handle from both stores chrome and opera are my motivation to move to this browser.

Opera in other hand it's right now my default browser. I use a lot of extensions and alot of tabs for office and personal projects. It has also the option to install extensions from chrome store and opera store. The GUI it's not bad but it's faster vs other browsers with all the stuffs mentioned before.

I don't know man, we can not hide to prevent the privacy stole of our personal data at all. In that case disconnect from internet. Become an island we no internet. As I mentioned before just check / manage what settings you let them see, also in extensions there's a extension that it's called police extension and guide you to know if your personal data it's save or not"
39167,thank you for the explanation. yeah indeed you are right.. it's about the preference of the user on how he or she protects his/her data to the internet. all browsers have the same purpose it is just a matter on how they are built in terms of security and such. i will have a look and mostly going to customize my browser to make it much secure moving forward.
39168,"Hey, spdy, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
39169,"Thanks for the spelling  grammar suggestion/ correction, I'm doing my best to express the idea. I'm not English native speaker. Thanks and have great day"
39170,"Another vote for Opera from me. :) Use with uBlock Origin and DuckDuckGo. Can even install Chrome extensions if that's your cup of tea. No issues on my end for the past couple of years - privacy or otherwise. It's better than Vivaldi in terms of stability (it was very buggy for me when I gave it a trial, but you may like it! Give it a whirl!), and for me, personally, it's been faster and less taxing on my machine than Firefox."
39171,cool. thanks for your input.. Opera seems to be the mostly used browser by many.
39172,Firefox is the only one I would trust.
39173,"i see.. me as well.. but duckduckgo is suggesting other privacy browsers like Brave, Vivaldi as alternatives. Do you think they are also good?"
39174,I don't trust Google so I don't use chromium based browsers
39175,I agree. so firefox is the only safe browser at the moment.
39176,Brave strips chromium of anything that reports back to Google
39177,"Safety:

On phones: Duck Duck Go (legit browser)

And on PC:  Opera + UBlock

Speed:

On Phones: UC Browser (personaly my favourite because of its features)

On PC: Chrome (fast but really not the safest...)"
39178,gotcha... opera is safe to use? no issue about their privacy?
39179,"Better than firefox, in terms of speed at least...

I could fall asleep sometimes until firefox opens even on a fast pc. Earlier (arround 2013 or even earlier) firefox was ok performance wise but now...

I dont like it personally...

But can you really be ""save"" on the internet? Not really I think"
39180,"Always used Chrome, felt like it was the most user friendly out of them all (i've been using it since its release in 2008), and I spent the last hour setting up Firefox. Gonna use it for a couple of days and see if it feels better than Chrome.

Did this cause I was inspired by people comments, I'll keep you updated."
39182,"I'll try to be as specific as I can:

* **Browsing**: feels faster. I don't know if it's just a feeling, but it feels a little faster than Chrome, both when launching it and when I browse websites. I jump from like Facebook to Twitter, to Twitch and so on and I don't feel like it has troubles making this operations. This doesn't mean that Chrome is slower, but Firefox feels smoother, which is probably the best word to describe it.
* **Addons and Extensions**: same story as Chrome but with few exceptions: a couple of extensions I had on chrome are not available in the Addons section of Firefox, but it's not really a downside. I'd say it could be better, cause the browser itself it's lighter this way, not having to load a lot of addons. Right now I have 7 addons on Firefox and 9 on Chrome. 
* **Possibility to change the way Firefox looks**: now this is something that I like, but never actually used. You can change stuff like button placements within Firefox itself to your liking, but it's something I haven't done cause I think it looks fine the way they programmed it, tho it's definitely a +1 for Firefox. Also there's a standard dark theme in Firefox, which I've never seen in Chrome, there if you want to have a dark theme you have to download it through the Chrome Web store app.
* **UI**: at first it's really messy, and you understand little to nothing. After 10/20 minutes of looking stuff throughout the option panel I figured it out, but it wasn't that easy of a task: Chrome has a more user-friendly option panel. 
* **Tabs in explorer**: now this is something purely subjective (and I can probably fix it but again I can't find anything in the option panel), but I hate that when I click on the Firefox icon in Windows it prompts all the tabs I have open within Firefox. While it could be useful from a certain point of view I just don't like it. When I click on something it has to do what it is supposed to do: open it, not telling me which one I want to open. Sure this can be fixed by navigating through different apps with Alt+Tab, but sometimes I like to use my mouse to navigate. Considering also that I like to navigate through tabs with ctrl+#, having the application to ask me which one I want to open it's stupid: it's obvious I want the last one I checked.
* **Shortctus**: This is neither a +1 or an issue, just something you have to get used to. Both share a couple of them, while others are not.

* **Conclusion**: absolutely you **have** to give Firefox a shot. It's a really well built browser, and I have the feeling that if you get used to it you'll switch to it with no problems whatsoever. Right now I still have Chrome as my default Browser, but I'm finding myself using Firefox more and more. It's just a matter of time. 

Hope that I've explained myself :)"
39183,Brave.
39184,"I'd say Firefox. I used it a few years ago, switched to Chrome and now switched back because of the quantum update. Firefox' scrolling is way smoother imo and you can also use most Chrome extension with the help of an addon. The mobile version is great because you can use most of the desktop add-ons. Also: more privacy than Chrome."
39185,"I always install Firefox but I never use it, do you feel it better or smoother than chrome?"
39186,Yes. The animations are very fluid and with its new engines websites load as fast as in chrome. I don't even have chrome installed anymore since a few weeks
39187,"Currently use chrome mainly, but since it's become a massive resource hog, I've been trialing Firefox quantum on my htpc and am so far liking it. May switch to that for my main browser."
39188,"I'm using Opera although not a complete fan of it, but its integreated adblock and screenshot tool are pretty neat."
39189,Vivaldi is pretty decent these days
39190,What does Vivaldi offer against chrome or opera?
39191,I find it is way faster than chrome and is not all kitchen sinky like chrome has become. It has some built in Adblock features and customizable settings. I have not used opera.
39192,Chrome and Firefox are the highest rated of the mainstream browsers. Personally always used Firefox since I got my own pc back in 2005
39193,Vivaldi if you're a power user
39194,What are the adventages over chrome?
39195,"privacy, features like tab stacking, web panels, etc... It's also highly customizable, there are a huge variety of options to tune it to your needs."
39196,"Firefox because of Quantum, plus the user face is more user-friendly and there are plenty of add-ons and, more importantly, themes."
39197,"I demand a traditional interface, and Firefox has it (after you restore the title and menu bars). Can't stand Chrome's weird design."
39198,What do you find weird about chrome dude?
39199,"It has its own style, no title bar, no menu bar. Programs should not have non-standard interfaces, that's bad design."
39200,I swear firefox looks more like chrome now in those exact ways.
39201,With better and cleaner design. Google chrome felt clunky because of the .net framework. But with google chrome redesign I bet they're both gonna be awesome.
39202,"So you like old designs? You might wanna try Windows 95, you might just like it."
39203,Chrome. Doesn't suck
39204,"no such thing as best browser exist

nothing is simply best no matter what you ask for"
39205,Vivaldi it's got great customization like theme schedule and tab placement plus it can use all chrome extensions
39206,Chrome if you have more than 16 gigs of ram. But for real I use chrome just cuz i have always used it and don’t feel like dealing with Microsoft stuff. Honestly edge and chrome are probably equivalent though
39207,"There is no best browser.

I can say however that Chrome that used to be the best, is no longer. 

For my personal use, Firefox \-\> Edge \-\> Vivaldi, most of the time i use Edge because it's faster to respond, it does lack for some compatibility because it's new, in those cases Firefox. Vivaldi is also nice."
39208,luakit.
39210,Just saying: Fuck Opera. Get away from that.
39211,"Opera sells your data
A shame cuz its a really solid browser especially their Opera GX version"
39212,"Yes,very sad that a good browser do that but is chinese,so,what i was expecting?"
39213,"Opera's privacy is bad, but the browser itself it amazing. Especially on Android."
39214,"There is nothing called best.. If you want privacy then it's firefox.. It uses less resources too.. If you like chrome, then it should be edge as it is very fast and uses less resources"
39215,"I've noticed that lately Chrome seems to like to freeze up on Reddit. Edge hasn't had that problem so far, thankfully."
39216,I would say the same probably. If you like chromium try edge or brave. Brave if you want an inbuilt ad blocker and BAT.
39217,"But I can't trust brave... For everything I use firefox.. The sites, which can't b opened in firefox(which is negligible) I use edge.."
39218,"Vivaldi. Packed with features and very customisable. Mouse gestures, sync, ad and tracker blocker. It’s the shizzle! 👌🏻"
39219,"Firefox has extensions on Android, and has end to end encrypted sync across desktop and mobile. It also has exclusive features like containers (login to the same site with different credentials)."
39220,"Vivaldi has caught up with Opera and surpassed it: not only is it up to spec, all the things that made Opera great originally and were scrapped during their transition have been restored. No reason anymore to use Opera except the built-in VPN I suppose."
39221,"Try Vivaldi, has its own adblocker engine with custom filters support and this days it's quite fast (Android and Desktop). Its adblocker isn't as complete as uBlock but it works reasonably well.

Pretty much... These days there isn't a best browser. Try all of them and stick with the one you feel it fits you the most."
39222,Go for firefox.
39223,So what about browsers like brave and vivaldi?
39224,"Vivaldi has a ton of features like tab stacking, notes, tab tiling and it is very customizable. Also they are a small team in Iceland so don't harvest your data."
39225,Brave has privacy feautures but I like it for earning BATs and supporting the crypto space
39226,I never really understood this. How does this work? What are bats?
39227,"BAT is a cryptocurrency. You get BAT by opting in to Brave Rewards and by seeing ""privacy respecting ads"" you gain BAT. You can use it to donate to websites and content creators. I hear they will also let you use it to buy Brave's built in vpn in the future"
39229,"There you don't find a best browser it's depends on your requirements
If you want privacy and security then it's Firefox
If you want low memory and battery consumption then it's Microsoft Edge......"
39230,"As of right now, I'd say Edge."
39231,"im using it,and i can say,for me its the best browser"
39232,I use brave and it's the best I can't go back to other browsers
39233,For cross platform efficiency I would recommend firefox. For efficiency in windows 10 I would recommend edge.
39234,I'd say firefox but just yesterday I installed brave in both my laptop and mobile and feeling good about it.. Haven't tried the bookmarks sync and etc... But it gives me bat tokens for watching ads. Give it a try.
39235,Edge
39236,"For general purposes, use MS edge. It's fast and easy on memory and battery usage. If you're a power user who spends most of his/her time in the browser, use Vivaldi. It has some much features, and the recent versions have very acceptable performance too."
39237,"Android/IOS  ; -

2. Soul browser . filter [abp.oisd.nl](https://abp.oisd.nl)

39238,"There is nothing like the best browser. In my experience , Edge is snappier compared to other Chromium based browsers. Firefox has introduced a slew of privacy features in recent times. May be try Firefox

I use Vivaldi because I like the features it offers. But not the fastest one"
39239,"There's tons of comparisons online, for example here: [https://maps-and-tables.neocities.org/browser\_comparison.htm](https://maps-and-tables.neocities.org/browser_comparison.htm) 

I'd say all of them are more or less the same nowadays. But don't use Chrome, that browser spies on you and sends your whole browsing history to Google, and doesnt even offer anything other browsers don't. There's really no reason to use Chrome except that it's preinstalled."
39240,"if you want to maximize anonimity and privacy i would use 2 browsers. one for logging into personal accounts and sensitive info, and one for only browsing and then wiping your data after you close it (duckduckgo is made for this). But if you dont care about privacy at all, test different ones, check out reviews, forums about certain browsers and just stick to the one you like. firefox and brave seem to be the best for privacy, but brave recently had a scandal with data selling which is obviously something to consider. opera is a cool web browser but dont use it they sell your data lol. vivaldi seems to have cool features and they dont sell your data since they are a very small team. ive never searched/used edge enough to tell you about it."
39241,"I use Gener8 browser > seems faster than Chrome and allows you to make money from the ads shown to you whilst browsing the web.

39251,last version came in 2017 and they abandoned the project moving to chrome wannabe
39252,"The latest version of Firefox at the moment which is [88.0.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/88.0.1/releasenotes/) was released on May 5, 2021, that's a long way from 2017, don't you think? By the way, looking at the [Firefox (and Gecko) repo](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/), there are still a lot of changes, it doesn't seem to me to be an abandoned project."
39253,"Firefox is abandoned, they just keep the hard fork in the same repo, but Quantum is different product with different goals, it's not Firefox"
39254,"Firefox is not an abandoned project, I gave you two pieces of evidence that Firefox is still maintained and was not killed in 2017 as you say, which is obviously false. Your various comments where you said that have downvoted. Am I supposed to take you seriously?"
39255,"if you can't see a difference between reality and marketing bs that's your problem, Firefox was abandoned, everything that made it superior was removed, there is no Firefox anymore

Quantum is different product, as limited as chromium, if they had a bit of decency they wouldn't be using the same repo and name but properly indicate that it's a hard fork

it's not new version of Firefox, it's much worse product built on ruins of Firefox' greatness"
39256,"> if you can't see a difference between reality and marketing bs that's your problem

I can tell the difference between the two.

Again, I repeat myself for the umpteenth time, Firefox has not been abandoned. Well, if that's the case, is it possible that you give sources?

39500,"There are substantial privacy and civil liberty issues with DuckDuckGo.  Tor Project accepted a $25k contribution from DDG, so you'll find that DDG problems are down-played.  Here they are spot-lighted:

* DDG promotes CloudFlare sites and gives them high rankings, which consequently compromises privacy, net neutrality, and anonymity:
   * Anonymity: CloudFlare DoS attacks Tor users, causing substantial damage to the Tor network.
   * Privacy: All CloudFlare sites are surreptitiously MitM'd by design.
   * Net neutrality: CloudFlare's attack on Tor users causes access inequality, the centerpiece to net neutrality.
   * (2019) DDG T-shirts are sold using [CloudFlare site](https://duckduckgo.merchmadeeasy.com/products/duckduckgo-t-shirta), thus surreptitiously sharing all order information (name, address, credit card, etc) with CloudFlare despite their statement at the bottom of the page saying ""DuckDuckGo is an Internet privacy company that empowers you to seamlessly take control of your personal information online, without any tradeoffs.""
* DDG is partnered with Yahoo (+Verizon and AOL by extension). These three corporations (same ownership) are evil in many ways:
   * Yahoo, Verizon, and AOL all supported CISPA (unwarranted surveillance bills)
   * Yahoo, Verizon, and AOL all use DNSBLs to block individuals from running their own mail servers, thus forcing an over-share of e-mail metadata with a relay.
   * Verizon and AOL both drug test their employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside of the workplace.
   * ~~Verizon is an ALEC member (a powerful superpac designed to put corporate political interests ahead of human beings).~~ (edit: Verizon dropped ALEC membership in 2018)
   * Verizon supports the TTP treaty.
   * Yahoo voluntarily ratted out a human rights journalist (Shi Tao) to the Chinese gov w/out warrant, leading to his incarceration.
   * Yahoo recently recovered ""deleted"" e-mail to convict a criminal. The deleted e-mail was not expected to be recoverable per the Yahoo Privacy Policy.

39501,Chromium != privacy
39502,"How do you figure?  


Chromium is open-source and can be self built with Google's analytics removed.   


Chromium != Chrome"
39504,"Either you're contradicting yourself or you're supporting u/darknetj's claim.  If you don't mind, would you describe what information Ungoogled Chromium leaks to Google under what circumstance?"
39506,So it doesn't. Differentiating between Chromium which is forked by Ungoogle Chromium ([a self-built Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)) and the [official Chromium downloads](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) is important here.
39507,"You need to come up with some supporting evidence.  The official story is of course that raw stock Chromium feeds Google and U/G mitigates that.  Your attempt to imply that U/G's mitigating countermeasures have failed to stop the leaks need some references.

Even a conspiracy theory carries more weight than what you've given because a conspiracy theory at least describes an unproven but plausible scenario.  You've not even hinted at what you believe U/G is leaking or why, much less supported it."
39508,**POST UPDATED** 11.09 - Thank you for the suggestions and additional info. I'd like to keep updating it more and adding new and interesting options.
39509,"1. Firefox needs to be configured to be actually private.
2. Brave has been noticed to whitelist Facebook and , I think, other big tech spies. Also, the browser calls back to Brave without your permission, and you can't turn off automatic updates.
3. Yes, it's good.
4. Pale moon has bad compatibility with modern security standards. But besides that it's like Firefox. You need to configure it to make it private, otherwise it connects to Google Analytics by default.
5. Waterfox is horrible. When you first start it, it sends traffic to multiple places, Google included. I checked this myself, Waterfox is trash.
6. Don't know.
7. Don't know.
8. Vivaldi doesn't show all of its source code.
 
A really good option is Iridium. It's not regularly updated, but it's safe Chromium based browser that is fully compatible with all the best privacy extensions. Ungoogled Chromium is more outdated, Iridium is basically the same thing, but newer, and it's easy to install. Just don't log in with a Google account, of course."
39510,"Good post!  I did want to put out a few corrections because not everything on this list is privacy friendly.

Brave - They're an ad company with a browser that essentially bribes people to use it with their own cryptocurrency BAT, [which you can't actually cash out](https://old.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/csdtr8/the_tokens_are_not_refundable_and_are_not/).  There's a bunch of other things ""wrong"" with it, but that's for another post.

Vivaldi -  They're a closed source browser.  They say they're open source but you can't view all their code and you definitely can't build from source. With a plethora of open source browsers in different engines, there's no reason to take a chance on a closed source one.

Esocia - [I made a post all about them fairly recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/cvhfyw/noble_goals_but_ecosia_falls_short_in_their) over in /r/privacy.  Escosia was actually tagged in one of the comments but never came around to correct or defend anything, so I assume everything I said was accurate.

Everything else looks good though!  Some people will poop all over some of those options, but they are still very valid options regardless of how popular they are.  Thanks for spreading the information!"
39511,"Also add Firefox Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container to the list that keeps different data differently which also helps in privacy.

Epic is a privacy-centric web browser. It was developed by Hidden Reflex (a software product company founded by Alok Bhardwaj, based in Washington DC and Bangalore, India) from Chromium source code.

39519,"> Mozilla Firefox - I think Firefox doesn't need any special introduction. :)

Of course it doesn't.

> Brave - Built on Chromium engine so it's compatible with all extensions from the Google Web Store.

The one reason I would never recommend this browser to anyone. It's basically a ""flavor"" of Google, meaning you're still supporting the tech giant and it's browser monopoly, which is bad because it gives Google too much power and complete control of the internet. There will be no more freedom, no more choice, and no more privacy.

> Tor - the big daddy of private browsing. Also your gate to the deep web.

But there's no built-in adblock (except on Tails), and you can't install an addon because that would ruin your anonymity. Just use Tails and all your problems will go away.

> Pale Moon - open source, very lightweight

I should probably remain silent before I end up starting another FFox vs PM war against the ptio staff.

> WaterFox - the ""old"" ""pre-Quantum"" Firefox, with new features and updates.

Also had some privacy issues so I don't recommend.

> Midori - open source, lightweight browser

That nobody ever uses and won't ever use since compared to other browsers, this one is useless.

> Falkon - this is a simple, open source, lightweight browser + it's a KDE project. No privacy concerns here.

Never tried it

> Vivaldi - for those who really like customization! They claim to collect no user data, only what you explicitly decide to share with them.

That claim is a lie, and Vivaldi does spy on you (though not as much as Firefox), and it doesn't even let you disable all the spyware features. It's essentially Chrome with customization. Vivaldi was created because some Opera devs didn't like the switch from Presto to Chromium and some other things, but Vivaldi uses the Chromium engine itself instead of using Firefox's engine or their own custom one. It's customization and features do make it a somewhat decent choice, but still not recommended.

GNU IceCat isn't allowed yet somehow Midori, Falkon, and Vivaldi all make the cut.

Now let's take a look at your search engines:

> DuckDuckGo - my default search engine for over an year now. Very powerful, efficient and user friendly.

Which is also based in the United States and runs on Amazon servers. DuckDuckGo has also violated it's privacy policy before. [Don't believe me?](https://archive.is/qntuk) And the best thing about this proprietary search engine is it's founder, Gabriel Weinberg, used to run a social network (names database) designed to collect lots of personal data from users. Still think DDG is safe?

> SearX - combined power of many search engines, just without collecting your data

And unlike the other search engines you listed, this one is completely open source, and many instances exist. Neocities has an interesting one that redirects you to a random instance known to work, while not using any instances that spy on you or use cloudflare. Privacytools.io's instance uses Matomo for user tracking and analytics. Let's see what kind of data so-called ""privacy""tools is collecting from us.

*top keywords and search engines, websites, social media websites, top page URLs, page titles, user countries, providers, operating system, browser marketshare, screen resolution, desktop VS mobile, engagement (time on site, pages per visit, repeated visits), top campaigns, custom variables, top entry/exit pages, downloaded files, and many more*

A full list of instances can be found [here](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Searx-instances).

> Ecosia - search and help plant trees. Very interesting project.

but doesn't really offer much in terms of privacy.

> StartPage - basically Google search with only the good stuff, without trackers or collecting private data.

Which is why I don't recommend it. Google runs a massive censorship campaign, aiming to remove all ""fake news"" or ""extremist"" content from their search. Don't believe me? Search for some alt-right conspiracy theory on Google, then search the exact same thing on Bing. Compare the results."
39520,"Waterfox is a fork of firefox with delayed updates. I don't know how many XUL add-ons are still maintained.

Palemoon is one of the worsest choices. It has a very small user count so any website could fingerprint it easily by user-agent. Its only use case should be legacy websites"
39521,"This ought to get you started.

39523,I’d like to add “Immune” and “Meet the Microbiologists”.  The American Society for Microbiology has quite a good podcast network.
39524,I love Sapolsky's lectures. He makes complex concepts understandable with simplified examples. He also has a a nice soothing teaching voice. You can check what he wrote on the whiteboard from time to time but his lectures can work well with just audio.
39525,I have them in audio form and have listened many times. I think it should be a prominent part of what we learn in high school.

-There's a handful of French ones whose names I can't remember right now. I'd look them up, but I only ever open up iTunes about once a month to reload, because it's such a piece of garbage (though if it ran at a decent speed I would only notice how well it facilitates organization)."
39582,Science Talk from Scientific American is another great one.
39583,"You already have This Week in Virology up there, but This Week in Microbiology just started back in February and is just as interesting."
39584,"I am by no means a astrophysics major, but I love Star Talk at www.startalkradio.net
You can't go wrong with Neil De'Grasse Tyson!"
39585,"BBC 4: Best of Natural History

Not hardcore but enjoyable"
39586,I would also love to hear this podcast. I haven't been able to find one like it yet.
39587,"pm me ideas of topic if you have any, we're starting to have a serious think about what to start reading - got some ideas"
39588,"You might like the [microbe.tv](http://www.microbe.tv/science-shows/) family of podcasts (This Week in Virology/Evolution/Microbiology etc.). They generally require more background knowledge than Hardcore History as their format tends to be a discussion of recent academic papers, but they’re more accessible than reading the papers themselves and go into a high level of detail on the particular subject."
39589,This. Sometimes I have to listen to parts of the TWIX podcasts more than once to comprehend them. That's when you know you've got the good stuff.
39590,"Sawbones {https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sawbones-podcast/sawbones} is more Hardcore Medicine than biology but may scratch your itch of what youre looking for. 

They explore the history of ailments and early methods of treatments. There's 2 hosts, a husband and wife. The wife is very knowledgeable and a doctor while the husband tries to interject with humor. The humor didnt work for me; I wished he would shutup and just let his wife talk, but thats their dynamic. 

Topical podcasts (Stuff You Should Know/Caustic Soda(defunct)) often cover the history certain diseases and how it shaped the ancient and modern world in detail. 

Also, philosopher Nick Bostrom has done a few podcasts. Hes actually the opposite of what youre looking for: he doesnt focus on the history of biology, rather the future of it and how the human race will become extinct, whether be from asteroid to AI to a superbug. Hes very interesting and may pique your interest."
39591,"I actually happen to like Bostrom's writings on germline genome editing quite a bit, could you provide a link?"
39592,"I'll check those out actually, cheers"
39593,"I did a series on sex in the ocean called ""ocean lovin"""
39594,"link plz, that sounds amazing"
39595,"It is part of my podcast [Ocean Science Radio](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio) but the ""Ocean Lovin"" series was a 6 part series that starts with [Lobsters and Seahorses](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-part-1) and ended with [Whales, Sharks and Dolphins](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-6) (though my personal favorite are the [Osedax worms](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-3).)"
39596,Did you get a chance to listen? Would love feedback.
39597,"Not yet, finishing a series atm, but this will be next - I'll let you know my thoughts"
39598,That would be a great thing if it existed. There are podcasts like [Cell's](http://www.cell.com/podcast) but they are... dry.
39599,Sounds like a great idea. two dongs way up
39600,"We'll give it a go, and don't worry - we won't be Russian"
39601,"I'm not aware of any show like that, but I would definitely listen if someone wanted to make it!"
39602,This Podcast Will Kill You  is a pretty good one about diseases
39603,"Depends on what exact area of biology you're talking about, but there aren't many I know of that you'd really call 'hardcore'. Closest might be:

Common Descent podcast which does fairly deep dives on topics that combine evolution, paleontology and a bit of light taxonomy.

Tetzoo podcast, which is a bit random and semi-chaotic but I like it. Covers aspects of tetrapod zoology, with occasional addition of cryptozoology, monster movie reviews, all sorts of odds and ends."
39604,"I’m not aware of a show that is exactly Hardcore Biology— but I’ve looked around quite a bit for science podcasts and these are some of my favorites:

Generation Anthropocene
Somewhat radiolab-esque show from Stanford 

Past Time 
Small, amazing paleontology show!!

Podship Earth 
New and very promising!

In Our Time
science stream at least—this is a big BBC show that interviews experts on a wide variety of topics 

Radio Ecoshock
Obviously, pretty depressing to listen to a lot 

Resistance Radio
Small show that needs better audio quality. He gets the best guests and is an amazing interviewer, this just isn’t one to listen to anywhere with background noise 

For The Wild
Some episodes are amazing, some just too hippy. Very compassionate host



None of these are exactly what you want, but they all have had episodes you’ll find interesting. We need more good biology podcasts out there!!  If you end up doing a new show, definitely let us know!"
39605,This Week in Virology http://www.twiv.tv/
39606,"Their other podcasts are excellent as well:
http://www.microbeworld.org/podcasts/this-week-in-microbiology
http://www.microbeworld.org/podcasts/this-week-in-parasitism

Kudos to Dr. Racaniello for putting these out each week for a number of years now!"
39607,Don't forget his others- this week is micro and parasitology!
39608,"Naked Genetics is good. ACS synthetic biology is a monthly interview podcast with paper authors, but it's just as technical and narrow as it sounds."
39609,is this something a google search will yield results ?
39610,Naked Genetics is a great find. Thanks!
39611,They have a more general one called Naked Science that is really good too
39612,/r/SuggestMeAPodcast as well 😁
39613,I like the eLife podcast. This week in virology is also really awesome.
39614,"I don't really listen to pure biology podcasts. Most of mine are more general sciency, that cover Biology here and there.

Top ones of those would probably be:
Nature Podcasts.
Skeptics Guide to the Universe.
Naked Scientists."
39615,"Bioscience is only once a month, but it's good."
39616,"I LOVE both the Adaptors and Origin Stories. Both are very high quality podcast and have interesting subjects. 

You might also like A Scientist Walk Into A Bar. It's all on the name."
39617,This Week In Virology: www.twiv.tv/
39618,"I just wanted to tack on, that some of the people involved with these podcast also do two other podcast. This week in Microbiology and This week in Parasitism. Unfortunately, they are not done on an actual weekly basis, as twiv is."
39619,"You're not going to find many strictly general biology podcasts, but there are plenty of great general science podcasts. Examples: Nature podcast, Guardian science podcast, Science Friday, etc. Just go to iTunes and search the science and medicine podcast page for interesting stuff. Sounds like you are pretty early in your science career so keep your mind open. You'll get the specific biology knowledge from your classes when it comes, but if you are super eager to get a jumpstart on the topics you mentioned above, you might want to check out some of these [open Yale lectures](http://oyc.yale.edu/). They have some specific advanced biology courses that might interest you."
39620,"Ooh this is brilliant, thank you!"
39621,This made my day.
39622,I don't think it's exactly what you're looking for but you might want to check out [Futures in Biotech.](http://twit.tv/show/futures-in-biotech)
39623,http://www.thenakedscientists.com/
39624,Maybe we should start one /r/biology. That would be pretty cool.
39625,That would be amazing!
39626,"Not sure if you're interested in development and the like, but I used to listen to a pretty cool embryology podcast. I can try and find it if you're interested. 

If you just want some supplemental information or a refresher on stuff like DNA rep, cell division, etc, Khan Academy has videos."
39627,"Ah I'd forgotten all about Kahn Academy, I used those for my A-levels!

And I'm willing to try any podcast really :) I mainly want them just for information in addition to revising etc, because I've found learning audibly to be quite useful, so it'd be nice to have something to stick on when playing video games etc :p"
39628,What is the name of this embryology podcast?
39629,"I can't remember for sure, as I used to listen to them years ago. I think [this](http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Podcast/podcast.htm) might be the one, though. Looks like they have some other interesting stuff....might be gone for a while :-)"
39630,"[Henry Stewart Talks](http://hstalks.com/main/index_category.php?id=252).  Not a podcast, but tons of great lectures."
39631,I wish more podcasts spent a second or two recapping methods used.  I feel they don't in most of the podcasts and feel like recapping methods would really reinforce the tools used for discovery.
39632,Nature's website has really good ones that come out weekly and cover a variety of topics.
39633,"I enjoy ""This Week in Microbiology"" along with virology and parasitology (TWiM, TWiV and TWiP respectively).  TWiP does some guess-the-diagnosis stuff that's pretty cool.  I just started listening to them and my only complaint is that they could be more streamlined.  The episodes can be as long as 2 hours and can go off into some conversational tangents (albeit useful tangents)."
39634,"TWiV and TWiM might be a bit hard to get into unless you have read a few primary research papers in your studies. It's basically a journal club format and, even though they have a lot of listeners who are non-scientists, I think you'd have to have a solid foundation in these topics to justify putting so much time into listening to them. TWiP is a bit more layperson-friendly, and their diagnosis game is great, so I would perhaps start with that. That's also the most medicine-oriented one since one of the hosts is a practicing physician, while all the hosts on TWiV and TWiM are research scientists, so I'd say TWiP is the best one to start with for someone looking to be a Physician's Assistant. I would just start at the beginning, but if you don't have that much time, you can start with episode 80 which is when the physician (Daniel Griffin) joined the podcast and they started doing the diagnosis game thing.

I haven't missed an episode of any of these podcasts in 3-4 years. I recently (actually, almost 2 months ago) wrote in to TWiV but my email hasn't been read out yet - anyone else had this experience? Not sure what to think of it, I'm sure they are getting tons of email especially now with the Zika hubbub."
39635,"TWiP is the only one of the tetrad (you forgot TWiEVO!) that I haven't listened much to. I've always felt that TWiM was more accessible than TWiV. In the latter I feel like the podcasters throw out a lot more jargon, which might just be because of immunology (for real, immunology has the *worst* jargon).

I've had a couple emails read on TWiV in the past usually within a week but I'd be willing to bet that Zika is delaying your's."
39636,"Just in the past two years, I started listening to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe.  It's not specifically a biology podcast- it hits all science topics but if you want to become a PA, they talk a LOT about fraudulent alternative medicine practices.  I'm an optometrist and have learned a great deal.  Not too much of it specifically applies to my field but when someone brings up a pseudoscientific treatment, I'm much more confident and successful at talking them out of it."
39637,Second this!  Fantastic podcast in general.  Also really helps cultivate your BS detector and trains your critical thinking skills.
39638,Third - this is the only podcast I make sure I listen to every week. I love it.
39639,"* Story Collider - Personal stories from scientists or people affected by science. (Think *The Moth* but for science/health) 
* Science Vs - Examines the science of new trends or conflicts (Paleo Diet, genetics of Homosexuality, E- Cigs) First season was on ABC but the next season should be coming out of Gimlet Media soon. 
* Flash Forward - Imagines a future with some new technology or innovation and explores the implications/likelihood with current experts and fiction
* Radiolab - Some of the science journalism out there. This American Life meets science. Not always biology but often so with usually a big dose of ethics. 
* Transistor - solid science journalism podcast that often has interesting biology stories (last one I remember was history of birth control) 
* White Coat, Black Art - Current topics in healthcare from a Canadian EM doc"
39640,"BBC's Inside Science podcast is a fantastic way to keep up with news on any kind of science. It has a bit of a bioscience slant because the host is a geneticist but they branch out to almost any topic, and they've done entire episodes all about physics, or ecology, or even the issue of women in science. Really great podcast and very succinct and well-produced too (which is really important to me).

Edit: All that said, their latest episode where they discussed gain-of-function research was rather awful. Very one-sided and factually inaccurate. I'll still listen, but that was very disappointing."
39641,"For studying, try Crash Course on YouTube. They have some really informative and easy to understand videos. They've sorted most of them by topic into playlists. Here are some you may find useful. 
Biology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF
Anatomy and Physiology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8
Chemistry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPHzzYuWy6fYEaX9mQQ8oGr
Psychology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOPRKzVLY0jJY-uHOH9KVU6"
39642,Yea I try and watch relevant Crash Course episodes before exams. Love that guy.
39643,"Sawbones is a pretty funny medical history podcast. Maybe not for studying, but it could be interesting for you nontheless."
39644,"Beepcast is great for behavioral ecology, but hasn't been updated in quite a long time."
39645,"Semi relevant, picmonics is currently helping my girlfriend memorize everything for nursing. They're animations but I can imagine listening to the audio alone"
39646,If you're interested in exploring careers/lives of scientists that took 'the path less traveled' then the [Jobs In Science Podcast](www.JobsInScience.ca) is worth a listen. I'd start with Ep3.
39647,"It sounds like you want more of a study aid. All of the bio podcasts I'm aware of are more popular science types of things. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any that I'd recommend for educational purposes. So really, use podcasts to inspire yourself, but don't use them to educate yourself."
39649,"I'm sorry but those guys are completely ignorant, especially when it comes to anything science-related. Really hard to listen to for me because of how wrong they get so many things."
39650,They're getting better.
39651,"[Skeptics' Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) - A weekly podcast kind of in the format of an unscripted radio show.  They've been around for more than a decade at this point.  They read science news and discuss it plus have segments where they play weird noises and the audience sends in their guess or where Steve presents the other hosts with 3 science new items and they have to figure out which one he made up.  The show focuses on critical thinking and they have an older (now abandoned) spinoff podcast called [5x5](https://legacy.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/5x5) which were 5 minute mini episodes about one particular science or critical thinking topic, 100+ episodes of that spinoff and the info is still good.  The SGU also host and attend science and skepticism conferences.

[Skeptoid](https://skeptoid.com/) - A weekly essay on a particular pseudoscience topic be it a ghost sighting, missing ship, unexplained light, conspiracy, etc.  The host does a good job providing sources on all the transcripts and puts out correction episodes any time he gets something wrong.  Educators can get a free premium subscription to get the podcast without ads and get the full podcast archive (free one is only the latest 50 episodes).  They also have a [teacher's toolkit](https://skeptoid.com/teachers) and 2 documentaries available on Youtube: [Principles of Curiosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKY6jJbyCo0) and the much older [Here Be Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=752V173e31o), with a third documentary (Science Friction) supposedly coming soon.  Some episodes of the podcast also make it onto [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8s6jngYwoGTFCnKyknOT6g) which can make it easy to share in class.

[Mindscape](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) - Hosted by physicist Sean Carroll this is a more standard interview style podcast with scientists and philosophers, sometimes he has episodes where it's just him talking about a particular topic in physics."
39652,I came here to say Skeptoid.
39653,Big fan of Skeptics' Guide to the Universe
39654,Thank you for suggesting these!
39655,Just what I was iso! Would you say these podcast are pg-13 school safe? I am looking for something I can put on in the background during our catch up days.
39656,Came to ask the same thing. I teach 7th grade
39657,>Tai Asks Why and Science Rules! with Bill Nye would be the safest ones to put on without listening yourself beforehand. Tai Asks Why even has a 7th Grader as one of the hosts.
39658,"Ologies is (unfortunately) not pg-13, though it is amazing. I can't speak to the others on the list."
39659,Wow in the World is an NPR science podcast for kids. Really good
39660,"A little dry but Science Friday can be informative.  

Some but not all episodes of Radiolab are great too.  The episode they did on shrimp vision stands out in my mind."
39661,The Radiolab and Fritz Haber is standard listening material when I teach chemistry. The episode title is something about evil.
39662,I also recommend This Podcast Will Kill You
39663,Always loved hidden brain
39664,"Hi, I’m Shankar Vedantam... such a unique voice. I can’t read “hidden brain” without hearing him say it in my head."
39665,"Short Wave (NPR) and This Podcast Will Kill You (Exactly Right) are some of my favorites!

Edit: TPWKY would be better for an older group that can appreciate microbio,  and they have versions of their episodes where they don't mention the cocktails they make for each ep since they know educators have used them. Short Wave has had some awesome episodes for hooks/extensions in my lessons with 6th graders."
39666,"The disappearing spoon is great if you  like science history. Hosted by Sam Keene who wrote the book of the same name (highly recommend) 
The episodes are short and nicely produced."
39667,"Whattt, where is This Podcast Will Kill You? That show is A-MAZ-ING."
39668,"Great list thank you.  13 Minutes to the Moon is pretty great right now, I'd check that out if you haven't yet!"
