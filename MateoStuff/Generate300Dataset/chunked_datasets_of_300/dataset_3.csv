937,"Go to Ikea, buy a LACK shelf and then use the metal ""feet"" they sell for cabinets to make stands. They come in 3 sizes. I made 2 for my last office and I took em home when I left the job. They give you so much space."
938,Since you replied to me... I want a picture!
939,"Let me see if I can dig one up. The stands are currently in my basement lol since i got to keep 'em since I paid for the materials. (Total cost $20)

I have a pic somewhere though. 

Here we go. Apologies for the mess lol.

940,"Cool, thanks for the pic. 

And no worries, my desk is usually packed with stuff too."
941,"Was my old office. :) I have a better one somewhere if I find it I'll post, it shows the 2 in a very clean office when I first moved in there."
942,"Here's the other 2 I could find. Much cleaner. It's a simple wall shelf, black, Lack I think it was. And the legs I forget the name, but they make rectangular ones, I opted for the cylindrical ones with padded feet, the second (middle) length. I think they were 4-5"". Enough room to fit a laptop or docking station underneath plus whatever else I needed. 

They were so cheap to make I made one for the other side of the room for my direct report as well when I had him. Love those shelves, can't wait to move and be able to use them again.

943,"That's actually really cool. I was thinking about building a section on my desk where I can stand. Also using stuff from IKEA, there was this blog post a while ago: http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html

I probably will do this the next time I make a trip to IKEA.

Here is a pic of my desk with the monitor stand. It's still clean as I recently moved it from one room to another. http://i.imgur.com/wOai0kr.jpg"
944,"Read up on Lifehacker about standing desks, there is a lot against them although I know they were all the rave a few years ago and at my last office a ton of people got them. They can be bad for you, just research it a bit.

I'd say make a nice desk with a great chair and make sure to take frequent breaks :)"
945,"I have a Humanscale Diffrient that I got on eBay for $100, it looks like [they still have some more](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Diffrient-Task-Light-ll-desklamp-by-Humanscale-/130517551693?pt=US_Desks_and_Home_Office_Furniture&hash=item1e6373ca4d).  Humanscale makes a desk clamp, but I haven't found one for cheap.  I think that it [looks pretty good on my desk](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadtillekeratne/8441897395/in/photostream/)."
946,"My roommate last year had this fucking rad desk lamp. I wish I had one too. It's basically a lamp that keeps the light where it should be, it doesn't light up the room at all, just the desk. 

EDIT: My roommate had what OP posted."
947,"[THIS] (http://i.imgur.com/kxrWjz6.jpg) is mine. Slick as shit. Allows you to move it anywhere, can point it upwards to avoid glare and only 8 euro in Ikea."
948,"After searching for something decent at second hand stores I finally broke down and got [this](http://www.staples.ca/en/Catalina-Lighting-Vision-Max-Swing-Arm-Magnifier-Lamp-22W-Black/product_802639_2-CA_1_20001)

It's got a magnifying glass in the center so it's great if you do any sort of hands-on work, but the lamp itself is also quite nice."
949,Butter Pecan as far as traditional flavors go but Phish food by Ben and Jerrys is better.
950,"I was expecting to have to ctrl-f to find the correct answer, Butter Pecan. I am so happy right now and proud of Reddit"
951,I came here just to make sure Phish Food was at the top of the list. That flavour is life-changing.
952,"I had Butter Almond once at a place in Denver, I will never go back to pecans"
953,"Just tried Phish Food for the first time last night, can confirm"
954,"I went to Hawaii once for a family trip and the dole plantation had a fresh pineapple ice cream that was phenomenal. I'd almost go back just for that...

Almost."
955,"As far as I know you can still get Dole whip at Disneyland, though it’s been a while since I’ve been there so I’m not positive."
956,"You can get Dole Whip at both Disney Land and Disney World. But, as an added bonus, if you go to the Polynesian resort at Disney World, you can get a adult version with booze."
957,They also serve this in Animal Kingdom now. Dole whip with your choice of light or dark rum.
958,Was there Sunday and I can report that they still have it.
959,I had a snow cone that had a scoop of pineapple ice cream on the bottom and I've been looking for pineapple flavored ice cream ever since. Still haven't found it yet.
960,"Bluebell Cookie Two Step.

It's a mix of cookies & cream and cookie dough... it's the best. However, it's almost ALWAYS sold out at my grocery stores :("
961,"OMG blue Bell ice cream. Im vocal about my strong opinions on ice cream (it's my kryptonite) and about 10 years ago I was in Texas training for a job driving in the remote areas between Austin and Houston.  Randomly, my trainer asked me if I've ever had Blue Bell ice cream. I said no and mumbled some rebuttal on how my Yankee ass (WNY represent!) is very aware that Ben and Jerry's has the lockdown on good readily available ice cream. My trainer pulled over and ran into a gas station to return with two small individual tubs of blue bell, vanilla of course, so you can focus on the foundation of what these crazy ass texans THINK they know about what makes a good cold dairy product. I pulled back the lid and shoved that wooden tongue depressor in there and tried a bite. Damn, I still remember that day. Ben and Jerry's was dethroned as my grocery store go to. It was Been and Jerry's to me now. I sulked back to yankeeland, tail between my legs dreaming of when I might be able to travel South enough and cross the Mason Dixon line to the land of milk and honey and whatever else blue Bell puts in there. I confide to my wife about this discovery and moan every few months. God bless her, she tried but she never did understand that blue bunny ice cream is not blue Bell. Thankfully, I finally moved out of that second rate ice cream area and down to the good ol South. Grits are on the menu and I graduated to a DAMN Yankee. After getting a hankering I go down to the local grocery and start looking. Not at that one, go to another.. Nope. Go to the website and find out that my sorry ass moved to a rural damn area outside of their distributed zone. So I vow, one of these days I'm just going to get in the car and drive until I can go to a H.E.B. and pick up a case of shiner Bock and give myself diabetes by way of fucking ice cream."
962,"That was beautiful. As a native Texan, I am much more appreciative of my readily available Blue Bell after reading your story. The only thing that happened to me was when they had to recall all their ice cream for some health issues. People lost it and the moment the ice cream came back on store shelves they were bought up so fast. Shiner is also great, I really like the light blonde!"
963,"blue bell, a shiner and a porch. that's really all you need."
964,It’s just that good.
966,My favorite is just plain blue bell vanilla or cookie dough but I definitely need to try this.
967,"Whelp, I know what I'm grabbing from HEB tomorrow."
968,"Beat me to it

I think it was recalled for a while though due to people getting sick from the cookie dough"
969,All blue bell was recalled for a while due to listeria to be fair.
970,Those were dark days...
972,Omg yesssss. My bf is from Italy and one time he took me to an authentic gelato place owned by Italians and we got stracciatella and hazelnut and it was sooooo good.
973,"peanut butter and chocolate, not with peanut butter cups, but with salty peanut butter chunks in rich chocolate ice cream"
974,"TILLLAMOOOOOOOOOKKKKK. 


Um, I mean... yeah, I agree."
975,It's a damn shame this post is so low.
976,Moose Tracks
977,Extreme Moose Tracks.
978,"Wait a minute, there’s a fucking extreme version?! You just helped me discover my new goal in life."
979,Yes you have to kill a moose and grind the hooves into your ice cream.
980,"Oh man, I forgot about this. Need to go buy some immediately"
981,"Went to America when I was 13, still haven't found an ice cream even in the same league. Omg Moose tracks. Yes."
982,Chocolate moose tracks
983,Fucking YES all night long
984,Highly under rated! Good work
985,It's supposedly the most popular ice cream flavour in the States.
986,**HIGHLY UNDERRATED**
987,Ben and Jerry's #1 selling flavor is Half Baked. It is also my favorite and can't believe not mentioned yet.
988,"yes half baked is amazing, it seems you either get cookie dough or fudge brownie in every bite. also s'mores is really good from them too"
989,I'd say that phish food is slightly better but half baked is also very good
990,"Home made vanilla. 

I'm a boring person."
991,"Do not apologize. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. It's made from the fruit of an orchid indigenous to Mexico. Natural pollinators don't live anywhere else, so every commercial flower is pollinated by hand using a technique developed by an ingenious 12-year-old. The pods are picked by hand at the peak of ripeness, processed, dried, bundled, aged for months, and finally combined with fresh eggs, milk, and pure white sugar, churned and frozen using technology which was invented just in time to take advantage of the marvelous new flavor. Every bite of vanilla is a journey across three continents and a testament to ingenuity."
992,"I read a Doomsday prep guide that said to stock up on saffron, vanilla and cinnamon as they will be extremely valuable commodities in a post-international-trade market. I found it interesting, but can't really imagine that I personally would ever accept it in trade for anything valuable (gas, guns/bullets, canned goods, etc)"
993,I don't know what kind of doomsday that is where people are still fancy enough to put fucking saffron on their food.
994,"I don't use it currently, I just know it's rare. Now if you had a case of chef boyardee cans..."
995,"People were certainly willing to pay a lot for spices in the past, and they made a lot of people wealthy and powerful...I've heard that one supposed reason that spices were so valuable was that in a world without refrigeration, people tended to eat a lot of meat that would be considered rotten by modern standards, so having spices to cover up the taste was a pretty desirable thing.  

Now me, if I'm thinking about what would be good to stock up on for barter in a post-industrial society, I'm going to go with drugs.  Or even better, the equipment and precursors to make them.  Stuff like antibiotics and opiates would be incredibly valuable.  Even something basic like Imodium could be life-or-death in some circumstances.  If we're talking apocalyptic wasteland levels of societal breakdown, stimulants like meth or even caffeine would be pretty valuable too."
996,"No officer, I bought this meth to trade with other survivors in the event doomsday scenario."
997,"Hm... Stock fake cinnamon, fake saffron and fake vanilla, they are cheap. If you want to get influence the real shit is better, the Saudi Arabia king will contact you for real saffron in the Doomsday."
998,"I'm not even sure why people stock up on gold  for similar scenarios. I would much prefer to be sitting on a mountain of stored food and medicine, fertile land with a stream, and security enhancing tools such as firearms, reloading presses and fences."
999,"Woah. TIL. I'm gonna feel soo fuckin' fancy the next time I eat ice cream.. 

""Caviar? Psshhh, nah. That's for plebs. Check out my *vanilla extract*."""
1000,Vanilla bean is the shit!
1001,"I ended up getting my wisdom teeth taken out this year and ate a ton of ice cream. I've always preferred vanilla but was convinced I wouldn't be eating mostly soft-solids and liquids for long so I just bought small containers of vanilla. I ended up going through a bunch of brands, most of whom had several types of vanilla each and I found my favorite one of all time. It's Your Churn - Vanilla Bean. If I ever get to choose my last meal for whatever reason, it will consist solely of that fucking ice cream."
1002,"But there's also fake vanilla that gets extracted out of wood (correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that it was wood)

Edit: vanillin (at least it's called that in German) can be extracted out of wood and even be made with cow manure.. At least a scientist in Japan managed to do it, it even requires less energy to get the aroma extracted out of three than it does to get it out of wood. So yeah.. the ""all natural"" on your vanilla icecream is true, but it doesn't have to be actual vanilla."
1003,"I make my own vanilla ice cream and have used vanilla beans from around the world. I buy them online from Beanilla and they are shipped three per test tube. When I got the first batch I was surprised how different they smelled and tasted from each other. For instance, Indian has a rich, chocolate scent while Tahitian is light and smells the most like what we associate with vanilla. There is also vanilla from Madagascar, Mexico, Indonesia, and Tonga."
1004,"This is the best flavor.  You can do anything with this.  Anything.  It has the most potential.  And it's pure, like the first snowfall of winter."
1005,"if you're truly an ""ice cream enthusiast"" and you're making it yourself, i bet it's not boring."
1006,"This with fresh fruit on top, mainly strawberries, is my personal favorite."
1007,"Yup! Any type of fruit on top is fair game for me: bananas, blueberries, peaches, hell even canteloupe that is cut in half and used as the bowl. Soo good."
1008,"Vanilla is great and complex. Fuck people who say vanilla is boring, they’re just regurgitating opinions they hear around them"
1009,"Have to agree, I like very strong vanilla or vanilla bean. It's so refreshing and cleansing."
1010,Cookies and cream. You can never fail with cookies and cream
1011,You *can* fail if your my local ice cream shop and used to serve ***chocolate chips*** instead of Oreos.
1012,That's... That's not *cookies* and cream. Did they label it as such or were you just eating chocolate chip ice cream?
1013,That’s just chocolate chip ice cream
1014,Thank you for being intelligent and having good taste buds
1015,"If you like cookies and cream, Ben n Jerry's ""milk and cookies"" flavor is an absolute must try. I didn't think cookies and cream could get any better, and this flavor proved me wrong.

Sucks though, because it doesn't come in a size any larger than a pint, afaik."
1016,"My dude, mint choco chip is where it's at! Coffee chip is also good!"
1017,I feel like coffee ice cream in general is underrated. It’s so good! It tastes like it was *meant* to be an ice cream flavor.
1018,Mint Oreo is the bomb.
1019,"Mint chocolate chip 


I'm just some guy I have zero qualifications"
1020,If you like to eat ice cream you are already an ice cream enthusiast
1021,Mint Oreo though...
1022,"No you are very correct. Not too crazy, not too simple. The perfect balance."
1023,How can I choose a favorite child??? All flavors are beautiful in their own unique way 😭
1732,Pistachio
1025,Pistachio gelato is where it's at.
1026,Talenti makes really nice pistachio gelato.
1027,Talenti pistachio is delicious.
1028,"If you ever find yourself in NYC or LA (or one of the European cities where they have them), visit Grom.  Their pistachio gelato is astoundingly good."
1029,real ones recognize
1030,"Finally, I found the right answer!"
1031,"Great by itself, but even better as part of spumoni as long as you can find a good cherry ice cream and a nice dark chocolate ice cream that’s not too sweet."
1032,im glad this is up on the list becuase even low cost pistachio ice cream is very good. making it yourself with well selected ingredients is a bucket list worthy endeavor
1033,Coffee 110%
1034,The Häagen-Dazs brand coffee flavor is the freakin bomb. My favorite ice cream since forever.
1035,"It's the best. The coffee flavour is SO strong, I love it."
1036,Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz!
1037,"Coffee flavored ice cream, coffee beans in ice cream, or coffee on ice cream?"
1038,I’m going to go with all 3. Coffee on icecream is more frappe but I still love it.  Coffee gelato is where it’s at.
1039,"Coffee flavored ice cream, but then you pour an espresso on top of it. (this heavenly experience is called an Affogato)

I make them at the airports on long layovers by buying a scoop of icecream, heading down to starbucks and getting a double espresso, then pouring that over my icecream bowl."
1040,"I had ""earl gray tea and cardamom"" ice cream in a trendy shop in Boston.  It was incredible."
1041,Green Tea ice cream is the bomb
1042,"I love green tea ice cream. The flavor is relatively subtle, but so pleasing."
1043,Fuck yes. Matcha ice cream is the *SHIT*
1044,"In high school, I worked at a certain ice cream shop with dozens of flavors. I gave myself literal cavities gaining this experience, eating quarts of that stuff for years*

*during the summer.

Mint chocolate chip is the best flavor. It's science."
1045,Mint chocolate chip is the best for me because I love mint and because it's not kinda boring the same way vanilla or chocolate are but it's not over the top like some weird Ben and Jerry's flavors. It's right in that sweet spot with like cookie dough or cookies and cream.
1046,"There's one thing I love about mint chocolate chip ice cream which is kind of weird. I forget which brand has the thin rectangular chunks of chocolate in the ice cream but I love taking a bite, spitting out the chocolate pieces, and when I'm done with my ice cream I then have a small hill of vaguely minty chocolate to enjoy.  It's probably the same enjoyment as eating a Rice Krispy treat kernel by kernel"
1047,Cheesecake ice cream forever
1049,"Only rocky road with real marshmallows, not the marshmallow cream!"
1050,Black Raspberry / Blackberry. Idk if those two berries are different but they’re both bangers
1052,Yup Graeters is famous for their black raspberry chip ice cream. You can get it shipped to you if you don't live in the Cincinnati area.
1053,Kawartha - black raspberry thunder
1054,"Yes, black raspberry, not some big corporate brands...the small homemade gourmet creamery's in MA...oh so good!"
1055,"They are different. We called them black caps. I didn't know they were raspberries, I just knew they were good. They got ripe just as summer vacation was starting. What a way to start the day!"
1056,"Ben & Jerry's - The Tonight Dough

CARAMEL & CHOCOLATE ICE CREAMS WITH CHOCOLATE COOKIE SWIRLS & GOBS OF CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH & PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE DOUGH."
1057,"this is the correct answer, tonight dough is like crack to me"
1058,"It's so many things! You can't get a boring bite!

And it comes in pints, so I don't have to share it."
1059,"I work at Baskin robbins so this might be heavily biased, but my favorites are love potion, trick Oreo treat, winter white chocolate and cotton candy!"
1060,"Cookie Dough, every other answer is wrong"
1061,The cookie dough has to be good though. The little cheap bites don’t cut it. Ben and Jerry’s cookie dough is a godsend
1062,"Agreed, I can just eat vanilla ice cream, the dough has to ADD something"
1064,"I've never had ben and jerry's cookie dough, is it really that good?"
1065,"Lavender. 

I used to hate the hell out of flower flavored things - made me feel like I was eating soap but one day I decided to go for it and suddenly Lavender Ice Cream has changed my life forever."
1066,"Licorice or Oregon Blackberry.

I am ready to be thrown into the fires of Reddit Hell for this."
1067,licorice ice cream ? Where has this been all of my life ?
1068,Haagen Dazs dulce de leche hands down
1069,mint chocolate chip
1070,Turkey Hill Mint Choco chip is the best.
1071,"Omg the shaved chocolate chips, why do no other major brands do this?????"
1072,"I sorted by controversial and I can't say I'm surprised to see this as the top comment.

It's my favorite too. Stay strong, brother. There are dozens of us out there."
1073,A person of fine taste I see!
1074,I had to scroll down pretty far to find the correct answer. To celebrate I am going to eat a Klondyke mint chocolate chip bar.
1075,"There's a store near me whose mint chocolate chip is spearmint flavored. To me, it tastes like you're eating toothpaste-flavored ice cream, but my kid loves it and prefers it over the ""traditional"" mint chocolate chip flavor."
1077,Mint Chocolate Chip by far! I do love a good Vanilla Bean too
1078,Cake batter
1079,"I worked at a Coldstone for a few years. Mix cake batter with chocolate ice cream, then add in cookie dough and brownie. Trust me.

Or if you’re a fruity person take cake batter, yellow cake, whipped cream and strawberries. Strawberry shortcake ice cream.

I could go all day."
1080,Call me basic but vanilla
1081,Mint Chocolate Chip. No exceptions
1083,What is stracciatella?
1084,"Imagine Chocolate chip, but the chocolate is drizzled into the ice cream, so it like like elongated drops.  It's a wonderful flavor of gelato (which is not ice cream)."
1250,Cherry Garcia
1086,"Got it as a joke

Has been my favorite ice cream for years"
1087,Spumoni!
1088,"Congratulations, you win."

Also, earl grey."
1107,Fuck off with your fancy pants ice cream! This is war
1108,Pistachio ice cream made with whole cream and egg yolks.
1109,"Tried and true chocolate chip mint.

Or, molasses crinkles cookie doh."
1110,"I use mint chocolate chip as my barometer flavor whenever I try out a new ice cream place. At its best it is the most refreshing desert out there.

My favorite place for mint chocolate chip is a dairy farm with an ice creamery on site.  They have the richest, creamiest mint chocolate chip out there and I compare every future cone to that place's."
1111,Blueberry cheesecake
1112,Vanilla.
1113,"Vanilla with just a tad Hersey's syrup.  Then stirred.   Little pools form melt, mix a spoonful of melt with stirred I've cream.   Yes, that whole statement is a flavor."
1114,Bittersweet sinphony...coffee ice cream with bittersweet chocolate swirls and chunks. I worked at a restaurant with a very popular seasonal ice cream shop for 12 years. Ice cream is life.
1115,There is a Kroger select brand flavor called brown butter bourbon truffle. It is amazing.
1116,Rite Aid's Chocolate Malted Crunch
1117,"Damn, so many possible answers. A really good black cherry or black raspberry is the best. But I love shiso leaf and multigrain flavored ice cream too. You can also never go wrong with classics like grasshopper pie/mint chocolate chip and strawberry cheesecake."
1118,Butter brickle. It’s ice cream flavored ice cream.
1119,Cinnamon. Surprisingly good.

1123,Ben n Jerry's chunky monkey. Banana ice cream with chocolate Chunks and walnuts
1124,Nice to see there’s one person with intelligence around here.
1125,"There's a local ice cream shop near me that makes their own ice cream from scratch and my wallet and waistline have suffered. They have a standard list of daily flavors (chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip, \[local coffee shop\] coffee, etc.), a list of ""daily"" (seasonal) flavors (they've have snickerdoodle (with chunks of snickerdoodle cookie in it!), almond poppy seed, huckleberry, peanut butter and jelly, lavender, and earl gray), and sorbets as well. Usually coconut or fruit flavored, but I don't go for that. Their snickerdoodle and earl gray are fucking amazing. I'm pretty sure they steeped the milk/cream in earl gray leaves before making the ice cream, because there weren't leaves in the scoop I had and I didn't see any in the tub. Their chocolate brownie was pretty bomb too. I think my favorite would be the earl gray though. It was so mild and unassuming, but still rich and delicious. 

Side note, lavender should not be an ice cream flavor. It tasted like eating perfume :("
1126,I’m a big fan of Earl Grey tea; I drink it pretty much every day. Found a gelato place on vacation that had an Earl Grey flavor and I can still taste how wonderful it was.
1127,Thai Tea
1128,"Honey butter. 

It’s basically vanilla ice cream with peanut butter and honey mixed in. It’s so delish. My local ice cream shop always changes their flavors either every week or every month."

1136,"In Switzerland - Movenpick’s Espresso Croquant

In the USA - Publix store brand Banana Split"

1139,"Green tea or red bean hands down.  Unfortunately they’re a pain in the ass to find here, so I can’t get them regularly."
1140,"Late to the party, but here in Sweden we have a small ice cream maker called Lejonet & Björnen. 

Their ice cream are bit pricier, but tastes like heaven. Their ""thing"" is to have whats says on the package in the ice cream.

For example, if it says ""Organic Banana"", the ice cream has real, organic banana in it. And the ice cream isn't yellow, it's brown. 


My favorite is Honey and saffron. It's bloody amazing!"

You're crazy"
1147,I can't help it if I think you're funny when you're mad.
1148,Vanilla is great because it's good by itself and with most add-ons. A lot of flavors don't mix as well as good ol' vanilla.
1149,You know what? I love vanilla. That shit is delicious and all these orange mocha Frappuccino assholes with their fancy ice cream flavors can go fuck themselves.
1150,"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.

It was always a treat for me, because the one ice cream place in my town growing up has the most fake stupid fucking ass hole bitch fucker cookie dough ice cream there was. It was 'cookie dough flavored'. No chunks of cookie dough, it was a tub of ice cream flavored like cookie dough with chocolate chips. FUCK.THAT.

On the occasion that I got real cookie dough with chunks of heaven in it, I would reach nirvana."
1151,"I can truly feel your pain with a description like that, man"
1153,"Man, it's so hard to find this these days. But when I do find it, I always try to buy it."
