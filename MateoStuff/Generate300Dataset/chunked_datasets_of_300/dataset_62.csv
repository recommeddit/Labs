19892,"Can highly recommend Shakewell, Pouya and Fat Nick (oh the irony)"
19893,I really enjoy a lot of Maxo Kream and JID when I workout. Maxo‚Äôs music is a hard hitter too.
19894,"first off, I recommend everyone to get a premium streaming service, got one a couple of days ago and the way I work out changed completely, it's so incredibly fun! Also, it works perfectly if what you are looking for is new songs in the same style you like to work out or whatever.

In any case I knew a few rap and trap songs that got me pumped but it was through browsing other people's playlists on the app that I got to know random songs that I find awesome to work out.

Some artists like A$ap Ferg, Desiigner or 2pac have a lot of songs that will make you feel great. Try also stuff like ""bitch better have my money"" by Rihanna, or songs by hardwell or kshmr if you're into EDM and it gets you pumped. Also, in rock, I find slipknot, mudvayne and rammstein extremely effective"

That last one was a lil Jon track but he has shit to get your blood going.

Many may be unfamiliar but old school Pitbull is undeniable. Forget any of the new stuff. Like seriously.

Digital Underground has fun energetic shit too.

MOP- ante up (you‚Äôll get pumped and someone might end up bleeding)

Wu tang- gravel pit

Cool breeze- watch for the hook

OutKast- skew it on the Bar-b, Rosa parks, B.O.B., ghettomusick

19917,"I recommend expanding your taste in music. hip hop is good, and there is SOME stuff bumping enough to trance you during workouts, but it's mostly leisure music, like stuff you roll down the street bumping or do homework to. 

Every type of music has its place

If you really prefer hip hop tho, I recommend Eminem, Jay rock, skepta, big Sean, or any hype rapper like that.

But the energy sustain effects aren't gonna be as good as it would if you bumped heavy metal or something, so don't expect that.

But it doesn't really matter if you donors slow paced stuff."

Sorry I got bored at some point. Might finish this later. Is it actually even that useful without youtube links on all of them (I'm sure they are on youtube just couldn't be bothered).

Plus by the look of it people have created spotify links so all my work looks pretty silly right about now.

EDIT: Will try and add more youtube links tomorrow, too tired right now. I would just like to point out I don't agree with all the choices on here, or even that it's a good set of songs, I'm just listing them. If nothing else a lot of these songs seem to appeal to very different musical tastes."
19936,... There must be an error here.  I don't see [Macho Man by The Village People](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO43p2Wqc08) on the list.  Definitely an error somewhere.
19937,"Nor do I see ""It's raining men"" - The Weather girls. I think the data is faulty."
19938,Not even [Physical by Olivia Newton-John](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz9VN40nCA). It's as if they've done absolutely no research for this at all!
19939,"Hmmm, quite."
19940,God's work.
19941,What good man will put all these songs together and distribute it legally for free for all of us? Will a hero rise up to this challenge?
19942,"Considering that I do not have a spotify account and will not because it sounds like you get 10 hours a month or you pay for it, your effort is worth much more kudos than everyone who linked to spotify combined.  True, the kudos are worthless, but you can have them anyway... and a hug, always a hug."
19943,"No, Spotify's free so long as you don't mind the obnoxious ads. It's like you have a private radio station where you pick out every song yourself."
19944,Wikipedia said after 6 months that you only get 10 hours per month.  Currently I love Pandora because it recently became unlimited listening (again) so I am not going to make another account which would mean another password to remember.
19945,"Ah fuck, seriously? Well, Pandora's not that great either. I'm constantly skipping through songs I hate because it associates the bands I like with bands I despise for reasons unknown and unfathomable."
19946,"Yea, being able to have 10 stations helps because you only get like 7 skips an hour, once you use the skips just start changing stations until you get something you like.  Not perfect, but compared with either paying for it or actual radio it seems awesome to me."
19947,"For now, though, Spotify seems like mush less of a hassle than constantly having to shift through stations and skipping. I think I've gone over six months on my Spotify account... No signs of timing just yet. Guess we'll just have to wait and see."
19948,Is possible wiki was wrong or I read it wrong * shrug * still not worth the hassle of another password haha.
19949,"Pleasantly surprised, I love many of these songs.

Anyway, you're the hero reddit deserves, and we need you right now. A thousand thanks."
19950,"IMO for Daft Punk, I'd do Harder Better Faster Stronger over One More Time, but that's just me :)"
19951,I would have to agree.
19952,This is bullshit because the Judas Priest song is not Painkiller.
19953,"And woulda gone with the title track offa Vengeance. We're purists, you and I."
19954,Except where I woulda put the title track of Chinese Democracy over Jungle as well because Jungle is so played out and I like Chinese Democracy so shut up.
19955,I so disagree with this list
19956,It should at least be an option to view it that way... The formatting of this list is terrible.
19957,"Just leave your mouse over the Load Track Info button, then use your scroll wheel or the right arrow key and click for each album."
19958,"Yes, it's like the worst representation of a list ever."
19959,"Christ, I was already irritable today and then I found this fucking link."
19960,This so much. Fuck this list.
19962,I fourth the motion. The list can get fucked. The motion is passed.
19963,There was never even a motion on the floor.
19964,Yeah what this guy said.
19965,This is why I workout at home.
19966,Why isn't this list 'Raining Blood' 100 times?
19967,"because you have to leave room for ""Angel of Death"""
19968,Some truly shitty tracks on this list
19969,I knew it was horseshit when I saw that Death From Above 1979 wasn't listed.
19970,Andrew W.K. x 100
19971,At least three of these should be Girls Own Love.
19972,"Okay, where's the torrent for it?"
19973,At the very least a full youtube playlist of all of this. Come on internet.
19974,yeah i love tracks that are in the guitar hero series too.
19975,"I wouldn't call it the best workout songs...

19976,The patient by tool is one of my favorites
19977,bleh. best 100 songs are the songs you like
19978,"Pantera's *Far Beyond Driven* is the greatest workout album of all time, I mean ""Strength Beyond Strength"", ""5 Minutes Alone"", ""Planet Caravan"", and ""Shedding Skin"" just to start with. Not one song made it?

Wait, not even one non-*FBD* Pantera song? Like ""A New Level"", ""Mouth For War"", or ""Revolution Is My Name""? What a horrible list."
19979,"Try to workout to the beat of ""Domination"", you would be dead before the end of the song"

19989,"Remenissions by Avenged Sevenfold
And
Electric Head (Part 1) by White Zombie 

Two of my all time favorites."
19990,I wish I could give you more than one upvote.
19991,FEAR FACTORY - SELF BIAS RESISTOR
19992,Pandora Radio and then I just type Grendel or Roter Sand and I go from there.
19993,Karma for Grendel!

also, i'm lazy."
19995,"Hah, i don't workout"
19996,[That is why you fail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLrpBLDWyCI)
19997,"Bill Conti - Gonna Fly Now (Rocky Theme), gets me pumped like no other"
19998,I want to add [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCJJhy7ek5Y)
19999,No Woodkid - Iron? Or did I miss it? Love that track towards the end of a workout to keep me pushing.
20000,The only people who have ever heard of that song are AC fans.
20001,Disappointed because of lack of Bangarang. That song will literally boost your squat by 20 pounds.
20002,[Riot Maker](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPC58B23I40) by Tech N9ne
20003,I would add [Lex by Ratatat.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VAkPjrnWM) That whole album is a great work out album
20004,Pro-tip (at least for the 30-40 y/o male crowd here): Pandora + Welcome to the Jungle station = Win.
20005,"My favorite workout song of all time:

Daft Punk Alive 2007 - Around the World/Better, Better, Faster, Stronger

You'll thank me later."
20006,My favorite to run to was always Revolution deathsquad by dragonforce.
20007,We should make our own list. This list isn't very good.
20008,They clearly forgot Guile's Theme.
20009,here's the playlist on Spotify: http://sharemyplaylists.com/men-s-health-best-workout-songs
20010,"Lose Yourself is higher than Eye of the Tiger.

Eye of the fucking tiger."
20012,"Lose Yourself isn't a bad workout song.  But it's even better when [mashed up with the Kill Bill theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWNZyPSOjs0).

I agree with you, though, it's nowhere near as good as Eye of the Tiger.  (And who the hell thinks Back in Black is the best?!?)."
20013,"[Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/pr%c3%b6lle/playlist/4Gsru178qIdERFjpIMVyNw)

All the 100 songs (almost)."
20014,"I added all the missing songs.

100 songs full playlist on spotify :)

http://open.spotify.com/user/rdorigo/playlist/6xyCvVbMi9esgWr4qbr9uu"
20015,most of those dont make sense to me tho but a lot of cool songs in there
20016,"[Edwin Starr - War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoRxD1oBWTU&feature=related)  for me, love it when that comes up in the gym"
20017,http://lifehacker.com/5622382/creating-the-ultimate-exercise-playlist
20018,Particle- Triple Threat. The ultimate song for running long distances.
20019,"I've always looked at lists like this and I honestly don't think specific lists of songs can determine the best workout songs. 

Personally, I wouldn't listen to any of those songs for my workouts. It depends on my mood and mentality on the day. Sometimes I play metal from my favourite band, other times its dubstep and sometimes its rap.

Don't think Another One Bites The Dust or Smoke on the Water would really pump me up for a soccer game."
20020,"I think most of these are pretty good, however, I think they should have separate lists for lifting and cardio. I could see nearly all of these being good, but some inappropriate for my situation."
20021,"Meh. They missed A LOT.

This is just a start:

[General Luna - Red Heaven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg1L6mJIUqM)

[Public Enemy - Prophets Of Rage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcv3McUVyAo#t=30s)

[The Crystal Method - Name of the Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4fgGZEggxE)

[The Wiseguys - Start the commotion ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMclGDkhDn0)

[Notorious B.I.G. / Jay - Z - Brooklyn's Finest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_DLD7OMUns#t=19s)

Their list is about 30 good songs and 70 *shrugs*."
20022,You can listen to clips of every song EXCEPT #1..?
20023,I have most of those songs and i listen to them while i run.
20024,Maybe because I am a bit of a metal head this list slightly disappoints me. I always find Slipknot awesome to work out to. Pulse of the Maggots is awesome before doing a huge squat set.
20025,Only thing on the list should be Eye of the Tiger on repeat.
20026,"Sorry, this is the number one workout song.


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW6_z9e0EfU"
20027,"Not only does the formatting suck, but the content fails as well. 0/10"
20028,Three or four good tunes in there.
20029,"How is there so much soft, low-tempo music in that list? Are they working out or going for a slow stroll through the mall?"
20030,"How did ""fuck the pain away"" by the peaches not make this list?"
20031,"This list sort of sucks.  It's more ""songs with workout themes"" than ""songs to workout to"".  Anyone got a good jogging playlist?  I've been using pandora and it usually fails me."
20032,"Depending on whether you need intensity or to zone out, I imagine the selections would change drastically.

If I were to run really long distances and needed a song for the journey, it would be

""Halcyon (On and On)"" by Orbital"
20033,Sent them an email telling them their interface is clunky and unusable. Hopefully they do something about it.
20034,"STAND THE FUCK BACK

I GOT THIS

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZY2mRG5mzg&t=1m7s"
20035,"There is no such thing as the ""best"" workout songs, whatever makes you pumped is your best workout song, be it mozart or whatever"
20036,"I usually workout to movie soundtracks.

[The Last of the Mohicans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1ryJDVuZ6k)

[Gladiator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFpZPZ_g4Hw)

[Rudy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-09ayPX_KVs)

If I had to go with a Rocky song, I would say this is the better song to work out to than Eye of the Tiger.

[Vince Dicola-Rocky IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lb3MTlIrC4)"
20037,"sorry, but this is the best rocky song to work out to, for running anyway.
[bill conti - going the distance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQkl7qa6RQ)"
20038,I was just pointing out there are better Rocky songs than the typical Tiger song. Distance is a great song.
20039,"When I do my speed workout, a bunch of the songs that I listen to are on here:  Wolf Like Me, Till I collapse, Lose Yourself, Enter Sandman.  However, many of these songs are terrible for working out.  Another One Bites the Dust?  Remember the Name?  Ugh.

I like that there are two songs from Rocky on the list, but my favorite one to work out to is missing... ""No Easy Way Out"""
20040,How do you not have Godsmack- alive???
20041,"I'd pick ""I Stand Alone"""
20042,I'm surprised Higher Ground by the Red Hot Chili Peppers wasn't on here
20043,"Pretty sure this list should be nothing but Thunderstruck, over and over and over again. I'm even a little upset they picked Back in Black as #1 over Thunderstruck."
20044,bacdafucup
20045,Yeah this is just a random collection of songs. I think the best stuff for working out is dance and electronica since most of the songs are 120bpm or higher which helps keep your heart rate up so you burn calories more efficiently with less work.
20046,"wtb torrent link , :P"
20047,"Check out ""Running Three"" from the Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) soundtrack. You will NOT be dissapointed!

Link for anyone interested: 

[I wish I was a heartbeat that never comes to rest!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYnTAbwhkVE)"
20048,Teeth like God's Shoeshine

20059,Slayer - Raining Blood
20060,"When I was in high school, some guy brought a CD in the weight room that had 13 tracks of Scorpions' Rock You Like A Hurricane. I thought that was pretty hilarious."
20061,"Maybe a bit late for the thread, but [Let it Burn by Stic.man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEKDozT0lNQ)"
20062,"I would not be able to workout to that terrible list. Lately, I've been listening to [Kvelertak](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9cBmmKPFvM) but when I'm being a little more lazy, I listen to my electronic playlist, which includes [Siriusmo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB_bO9upWXs), [Mord Fustang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrB0igo709E), [Wolfgang Gartner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc), [Bassnectar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOfEtjBjhdc) to name a few."
