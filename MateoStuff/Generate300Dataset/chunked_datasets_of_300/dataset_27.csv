8735,"I like your analogy, but nah it's nothing like that. Its simply that the work bacteria do to drill into your enamel takes time. Like, a lot of time. Its enzymatic and chemical reactions that break down the enamel, and if you're wiping these biofilms (bacterial masses, AKA. tartar) off your teeth each day, you're doing 95% of what's needed to avoid cavities, as the bacteria simply don't have the time to ""set up shop"", as it were. 

The spaces IN BETWEEN your teeth, however... well they simply don't get reached by a toothbrush. So, if you're only brushing your teeth, you're leaving all the bacteria between them there to just work away. They can set up shop, get to work, and destroy your enamel a little bit each second, minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day, because you're never removing them.

It's like if police only ever patrolled major roads. Would that eliminate all crime? Of course not, the criminals would simply move to and harass the areas that AREN'T being patrolled.

This is why most cavities start between the teeth -- that's just where the bacteria are the most protected, and can do their work undisturbed."
8736,"That makes a lot more sense, too."
8737,Well that would be an interesting marketing strategy
8738,We are just happy that you are making the effort to floss as well as brush.  We don’t care what order you do it in!
8739,"I've been told by about a million people who have had dental issues:  Take really good care of your teeth.  It's one of the first things most people notice about you, has a lot to do with your health, and means you won't need dentures or other costly operations later in life."
8740,Amen!
8741,"Not a dentist or hygienist. But I did go through an extensive period of tooth/mouth-care as result of bad choices in my younger years.

I had reconstruction done in Cancun and had extensive consultations with dentist/hygienists that weren't biased by North American ""marketing"". Avoid abrasive toothpastes, get yourself a good ultrasonic toothbrush, floss once or even twice a day.  

My particular problem was that my mouth goes dry at night due to the way I sleep. Once I started using dental appliances at night my gum health increased drastically so much so that when I stopped using those appliances I started using a mouthguard at night."
8742,I've heard that mouth going dry at night is the reason for morning breath. does the mouth guard/ appliances help to alleviate some of it?
8743,"Absolutely. I use a rinse at night after I brush called Biotine it leaves a little bit of a residue in your mouth but it's not unpleasant, just takes a little to get used to. The mouth guard keeps you from grinding, also keeps your teeth and gums moist. Definitely notice the difference in the morning, now it's just routine."
8744,"Biotine didnt work for me, and Ive use a mouth guard in an attempt to help with my TMJ... turns out I just mouth breathe at night and dont grind or clench, so dry mouth is life."
8745,"Using a vented mouth guard? I have the same habits biotene with the mouth guard/dental appliances when I was using them made a huge difference.

Plus like things like brushing your tongue and stuff that my dentist here recommended."
8746,"Naa, mines just a mouth guard that fits on the top teeth only, to level out my bite and to stop grinding my teeth. Tbh, I think my mouth breathing habit comes from the fact that I also have a deviated septum and quite my nose will clog up enough where I can't comfortably breathe through it. Also doesn't help that I've become minorly allergic to cats... and own a cat. 

I brush my tongue the best I can (super sensitive gag reflex. Seriously sticking my tongue out too far makes me gag -.-) and I have a sonicare tooth brush. So I try my best."
8747,"Hygienist—The biggest benefit of toothpaste is fluoride and fresh breath. As long as it has the ADA seal of approval, it has the proper amount of fluoride.  If you have sensitivity. Get a formula that contains potassium nitrate (should be listed with fluoride as an active ingredient on the back of the box).
Otherwise, use a TP that you like the flavor of.  If you force yourself to  use one that you hate, you won’t brush long enough.  
Invest in a good electric toothbrush—one that plugs into an outlet and sits on a charger (NOT a cheapy battery one). Oral-B and Sonicare are good quality choices.
Obviously, floss once daily and consider using  “Soft Picks” for wider spaces"
8749,"You're the first person to recommend Sensodyne for the average person, regardless of whether or not they experience tooth sensitivity. Most of the comments have said to use it IF you're sensitive, but I don't understand why you would wait to become sensitive before switching to it.... why not just use it all the time to avoid becoming sensitive in the first place??"
8750,There is nothing special about sensodyne other than it contains an added ingredient called potassium nitrate for sensitivity.  It still contains fluoride and can be used as your daily toothpaste.  The only reason they put the warning on the label to discontinue use and call your dentist if sensitivity continues is because there are ppl out there who are “sensitive” because they have a huge cavity or abscess that cannot be cured with any toothpaste. I’m a hygienist and I use sensodyne every day because I like the light mint flavor. Lol
8751,"Dental nightmare here, almost got everything fixed after a year of almost weekly appointments. 

Asked my dentist this question. He said if it’s got flouride, it’s good. Doesn’t matter how expensive or cheap.

Flossing of some type is important. You will get cavities around your gum line and between your teeth eventually if you don’t. If real floss bugs you, invest in a water flosser."
8752,"Toothpaste is clearly a lie. They damage your teeth, that's why dentists recommend them, because they get paid for fixing your teeth. Trust me, I'm an Anti-Mask-Flatearther who wasn't brushed his teeth in 21 years."
54051,Dad?
8754,"No joke, but years back i really have seen a conspiracy vid on youtube claiming that flouride will damage your teeth."
8755,My city is trying to kill me they add fluoride in their water
8756,Yak
8757,Hygienist—Disregard this person.  He clearly needs psychological help.
8759,Why does this have upvotes?

8768,"Thank you to everyone who has posted! The turnout on this has been far better than I expected! 

I've been browsing the dentistry subreddit (and posted this question here as well), and found some useful information on the abrasiveness of different toothpastes. 

[As you can see here](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0), some toothpastes (mostly those branded as ""whitening"" pastes) are so abrasive that the FDA actually considers them harmful to teeth, as they simply do too much damage to the enamel. Most of the users in the dentistry sub recommended toothpastes in the blue category, or the first half of the green category. Colgate Total was an often-recommended one, as it's low in abrasiveness, and uses Stannous Fluoride instead of Sodium Fluoride, which is better for the teeth in a few ways (but sometimes tastes a bit weirder to people)"
8769,I am told that brushing with the *Close Up* brand of toothpaste is in fact worse than not brushing at all. Is there anyone with a professional opinion who can confirm or deny?
8770,"Not a dental professional, but after browsing the dentistry subreddit, I came across some discussions on abrasive toothpastes and the like, and you should take a look at [This Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0). Pretty much every dentist in the forum said to avoid anything that's more abrasive than midway through the green section. You'll also note that pastes in the red section are actually considered to be actively harmful to the teeth. Close Up with Baking Soda is halfway through the yellow section -- It's just far too abrasive."
8771,I haven’t heard of this rumor and I’ve been a hygienist for 30 years
8772,"“Crest has been shown to be an effective decay-preventing dentifrice when used is a conscientiously-applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care.”

Many of us boomers still remember that a guy in a lab coat told us this in multiple Crest commercials of the 1950’s and 1960’s. It sounded impressive. It was also on the back of all their toothpaste tubes.

Our elementary school teacher told us that it means if you brush your teeth and go to the dentist regularly, Crest is okay.

I’m not a dentist or dental hygienist and this doesn’t come anywhere near answering your question, sorry."
8773,"Obligatory not a dentist, but I cannot stress how well the waterpik works, especially when filled with listerine. Use twice a day or whenever something feels stuck in my teeth. Went from lots of pockets in my gums and random soreness to none and no bleeding during cleanings. Can definitely tell the difference if I go away on vacation for a week without it... So I got a portable one as well.

My hygienist says no toothpaste with baking soda in it, the abrasive destroys your teeth. I used to use whitening toothpaste and gave myself cavities."
8774,"Waterpick ***FILLED WITH LISTERINE***? 

Someone's got a masochism fetish..."
8775,"It says in the manual that you can do that. I tried diluting 5:1 with water, but found 1:1 works great and keeps itself sterile."
8776,"So what you're saying is it hurts so good? Kinky. 

(I'm just teasing, it's just... I cant NOT imagine the stinging feeling :P)"
8777,"Hygienist—water piks are gaining in popularity again and the newer ones are very effective ion removing food around braces, implants, bridges and larger gaps. I generally don’t recommend Listerine as a rinse unless it’s the Zero, meaning it’s alcohol free.  Listerine has the most alcohol of any of the rinses and tt not only kills the bad bacteria, but it also kills the good bacteria that helps neutralize acids and bad breath."
8778,"I've had a thought about this recently, myself.  I'd be curious to know if any dentists think baking soda toothpaste is superior for daily cleaning.  Lately I've been using baking soda to clean baked on food from pots and pans, and that stuff works miracles.  Contrary to what you might think, it's superpowers don't come from letting dishes soak in it, or at least, it isn't *only* from letting dishes soak in it.  I'm not sure if that does anything or not.  In my experience, baking soda works because it is surprisingly abrasive.  I imagine it must be sharp but fine like moon dust.  I'm definitely rethinking baking soda toothpaste based on that experience.  I'd love to know if 4 out of if 5 dentists agree."
8779,No. Baking soda will grind your teeth away slowly and that tissue never grows back. Wouldn’t use it on my own teeth. (Dentist)
8780,"You can see this effect taken to a ridiculous extreme in dogs that play with tennis balls lifelong.  Every time the ball hits the ground  the fuzz collects fine grit and sand, essentially turning the outer surface into fine grit sandpaper.  Over years of chewing, dogs will wear their teeth down to nubs."
8781,"Wow, that's fascinating, and sad. Wouldn't have thought of that, but it makes perfect sense."
8782,"It's way too abrasive for day to day brushing. It's like taking a steelwire brush to your car paint to clean it. Sure it will get the dirt off, but damages your paint in the process."
8783,The mental image of someone scouring their car with steel wool just sent a shiver down my spine.
8784,"On my other copy of this post, on the dentistry subreddit, every single person who commented on baking soda said to avoid it, all citing the same damage caused from its abrasiveness.

I can totally understand the idea of ""well it cleans my dishes, surely it will clean my teeth"", but the thing we all forget is that our teeth ***are not made of stainless steel having food baked on at 400 degrees***."
8785,"There isn’t enough baking soda in a tube toothpaste to do much damage to your teeth.  The fluoride will help rebuild lost microns of enamel from brushing. A little bit of abrasiveness will help remove surface stains.  If you like the taste of it then great, use it. Just don’t dip your toothbrush into a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda and brush like a maniac every day."
8787,"Gargling actually doesn't expose any part of your mouth to the fluid -- its all in your throat when you gargle. Just swish it around inside your mouth. 

But also, ***NO***. Christ no, you might as well clean your mouth with bleach. This sort of advice comes from people who just thing bacteria of any kind = bad, not realizing that the only reason we're ***alive*** is because of the bacteria keeping us alive in our bodies. 

Yes, there are harmful bacteria that cause cavities. There are also helpful ones that heal mouth damage. Hydrogen peroxide doesn't distinguish between these -- it just kills everything. Mouthwash obviously does the same, but is fortified with fluoride and other things to help offset that, and can be useful in certain cases."
8789,"Unfortunately, I am not a dentist, and cannot recommend mouth cleaning products, as I don't use them. My original comment was just repeating what I have been told from dental professionals, though."
8790,"A 50/50 combo of water and hydrogen peroxide is great for gingivitis for  short term use. As long as you don’t swallow it, it won’t hurt you."
8791,\*All toothpaste brands accounts activate\*
8792,Is charcoal toothpaste good for teeth or is it bad in the long run?
8793,"No idea why this is being downvoted, it's a valid question.

The real answer though, is that regardless of whether its good or bad, what it certainly is is ***useless***. Charcoal does not work the way people think it does, and the way marketing teams want people to think it does. What it can do, if implemented incorrectly, though, is act as an abrasive, and damage your teeth. As such, I would recommend you avoid it, along with any whitening toothpaste, [which are far TOO abrasive](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0)."
8794,No.  Stay away from it.  It’s way too abrasive for your teeth.  We hygienists hate cleaning black charcoal particulates out from under your gums!
8795,Bad
8796,"lol i love american doctors XD  
when i asked mine, he instead shrugged and said ""they're pretty much the same thing""."
8797,Okay but what about mouth wash? Alcohol or non alcohol?
8798,What about toothbrush? Is there any better than others? Are the electric ones better?
8799,"I have sonicare and a regular brush as well. The regular brush is bigger and makes more suds and it feels good to do that one every now and again.  Gets my gums better. Feels like a whole mouth clean.

But the sonicare like.. polishes my teeth. It's very nice."
8800,"Hygienist—I find that electric ones are superior to manual.  Especially for kids and people with dexterity issues.  I do NOT recommend cheapo battery operated ones.  Invest in an Oral B or Sonicare that plugs into an outlet and sits on a charger.  I find that patients who use battery TBs look worse because they let the batteries run down and they become ineffective. I would have your hygienist demonstrate how to use one properly as well because they won’t work effectively with improper technique.  That being said, I have patients who do an excellent job with a manual toothbrush.  Your dental professional can help you determine if you should consider an alternative."
8801,"Hygienist here. Honestly, manual or electric both are fine. The thing that is important is brushing technique. Also, soft bristles. Also, changing your gross, old, bacteria infested toothbrush heads. I like using a sonicare because it has a two minute timer built in and the colored bristles fade to white as they wear out so you know to replace them. They’re expensive though, a manual works just as well."
8803,"I typically wreck my toothbrushes, which I know is bad (I go through a toothbrush every month, easily).  Do you know if an electric toothbrush will help me no wear my brush out as bad?"
8804,"If you're doing that, it just means you're brushing ***far*** too hard. You're almost certainly scarring your gums and wearing micro-fissures into your enamel. You need to just focus your mind on being more gentle when you brush. A typical ***Soft-bristled*** brush head should last you 3-4 months. You should not use anything more stiff than soft bristles. 

An electric toothbrush will probably help you, though, simply because you don't need to do any brushing motion at all when using one. You just hold it against your teeth and let its movement do the cleaning for you, taking care to reach all the different parts and sides of your mouth and teeth.

I would personally recommend that, when you buy an electric toothbrush, you bring it with you to your dentist and ask them to show you how to use it properly. If you're still holding it too forcefully against your teeth, it will do damage."
8805,"That’s some really good advice.  I’m just a dumbass, I guess.  “Ask the professional tooth brusher how to brush your teeth?  No, your way is better.”"
8806,"Lol. By the way, I'm not a dentist, but what I typed out is what three separate dentists and dental hygienicists have told me, pretty much verbatim. They've all explained it the same way each time, too, which makes it far more credible than if they all had different reasonings."
8807,"You didn't need to be!  That should have been the first thought, to ask the professional for help."
8808,Oral B makes an electric brush with a red light that lights up in your peripheral vision when it senses you are pressing too hard.  It trains you to ease up.  I would recommend that one for you.
8809,I'll take a look.  That sounds like a life-saver for me.
8810,"I can’t remember the exact model name, but I used to have one."
8811,"Not a dentist, but work for a large teeth whitening and toothpaste manufacturer. Echo what many dentists have said, look for the fluoride content. As for whitening toothpaste, you are not going to see dramatic differences through whitening toothpaste. The hydrogen peroxide content is so small that there is not much whitening that can occur - in general hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide should not touch the gums/tongue for an extended amount of time (this is one of the many causes sensitivity when whitening). For this reason the amount of whitening agents contained in toothpaste is minimal. Honestly you are better off getting total plaque control toothpastes and just use whitening products, rather that expect that using whitening toothpaste is going to change your tooth shade in a dramatic way. 

Important thing to note, many whitening toothpastes are not meant to be used daily, multiple times a day. In fact, you can have a lot of abrasion if you are brushing a lot with toothpastes contacting whitening agents in it."
8812,Hygienist—this is correct.
35361,Cocaine
8815,That's harssh
8816,"If you’ve got tooth pain, there is literally no better medicine, I will say that much."
8817,"If you’ve got tooth pain, there is literally no better ~~medicine~~ **painkiller**, I will say that much.  
  
FTFY"
8818,All the same. It’s chalk and Fluoride with the exception of whitening ones which add something abrasive
8819,"If you really want chalk, get Vicco from India. It’s an herbal one and actually contains real chalk. I have several towels with permanent stains from wiping my mouth after brushing with it."
8820,"According to the information I've been getting from every dentist on this sub, and on the dentistry sub, I would personally recommend you discontinue your use of a chalk-bearing toothpaste, and instead switch to one without abrasives, and with fluoride."
8821,"Nooo I don’t use that anymore, I just did in the past. Love the taste, hate the issues that come with it."
8822,*Permanent* stains?  That's... interesting.  I think I'll pass though.
8823,"i use that everyday, havent had any canker sores or tooth issues since. Pretty wonderful stuff"
8824,"Obligatory not a dentist.

My dentist recommends Parodontax in general. I fucking hate it, because some sadist decided to make pink salty toothpaste, but I trust her professional medical opinion."
8825,"I don't know why your comment is being downvoted without explanation. 

From what I could find online, though, it appears that Pardontax is exactly the same as any other decent toothpaste like Colgate Total, with the same set of active ingredients. If you hate the taste, id recommend switching to something you like. Enjoying the activity will make you far more likely to brush for longer, and more often, and that will make a far larger difference than the toothpaste you use."
8826,"Hygienist—Paradontax  isn’t special.  It’s active ingredient is Stannous fluoride, which is beneficial because it not only prevents decay, but it is also bacteriocidal, meaning it kills bacteria, unlike sodium fluoride which does not. Crests Pro Health formula and several other brand name formulas are the exact same thing.  The downside of stannous fluoride is that it is very irritating to the gums long term.  It has been available for years in prescription rinses for people who have had oral surgeries to keep bacteria levels down so they can heal faster.  Only in the last several years did it pop up in OTC toothpastes.  Be warned that if your gums start burning and sloughing and you are using a formula containing stannous fluoride, you should discontinue use and switch to one with sodium fluoride."
8827,I ain't a dentist but I can say no. No toothpaste can be the best. Each one specializes for something- some for sensitivity and some for whiteness. Choose the one which you feel will give you maximum benefits
8828,"Hygienist—The only “special” thing about toothpaste is fluoride and fresh breath. Also sensitive brands that contain potassium nitrate.
Otherwise, just use one you like the flavor of."
8829,My dentist who is awesome and recognized in his field doesn't use any tooth paste.  He just flosses and uses mouthwash
8830,"The periodontist that I saw while stationed in the Pentagon told me that of the two parts of dental hygiene, flossing is actually more important than brushing."
8831,"Also, why do different toothpastes advertise to be good at different things (""whitening"", ""cavity protection"", ""gum protection"", etc.) when most/all of them seem to have the same active ingredient (Floride)?"
8832,"It's about shelf coverage. the more varieties a brand has, the more of a supermarket shelf they can cover, so the more likely you are to see their brand and buy it."
8834,So they're equally good at all those things?
8835,"Brushing well matters much, much more than the toothpaste you use.  Largely the toothpaste's function is as a bit of an abrasive to aid cleaning, to provide flouride and for taste/smell.

I'm sure that if you brushed well never using toothpaste there wouldn't be a huge difference compared to if you used it."
8836,"Both my dentist and my orthodontist have told me this too. They said in the end isn't necessary or as important as good brushing. My orthodontist said he doesn't use toothpaste, and going by his breath, I'd say he's telling the truth. His teeth are still very white."
8837,"Thirded, many years ago my dentist told me that toothpaste is unnecessary for properly cleaning the teeth--what matters is the brushing motion.  Toothpaste is ""mostly for breath"".

I asked him what he thought of whitening toothpastes, and he said ""They have very good advertising."""
8838,Source for proper brushing technique?
8839,"I once asked a dentist if toothpastes are good. His answer was - ""yes, they are good. For the people that produce and sell them"""
8840,"I can state with some experience that 2 years without brushing my teeth did not reduce the whiteness of my teeth, nor did I get any holes. I did not do anything with my teeth for that 2 year period other than brushing them with water on a toothbrush. Right now I floss and brush them, to see if there's any difference."
8841,"Whiteness and tooth health are not one and the same, mind."
8842,"this is true, your teeth naturally have a yellowish tint, we use additives to make them as white as we believe they should be."
8843,"Isn't this relevant to OP's question? Some whitening toothpastes actually do contain things that alter the color of your teeth. The fluoride in toothpaste is there to help your enamel, is it not? Wouldn't that make an actual difference between toothpastes, and give regular toothpaste a purpose?"
8845,"This is common in other products. Take a look at all the different varieties of Dove shampoo for example, and compare the ingredients list. They're identical, except sometimes the positions of the last two items is swapped."
8846,Fluoride.
8847,"The gum protection portion of a toothpaste is in reference to an anti-gingivitis chemical called triclosan. 

Personally, I use a toothpaste that has both flouride and triclosan, and I brush for nearly 3 minutes instead of two every time I brush. I don't use toothpastes with the ""extra whitening"" because I have nice teeth already brushing the way I do, and eating as well as I do."
8848,"Also, do whitening toothpastes actually work?"
8849,"Mythbusters tried to do a segment on it but weren't allowed by the network (or something like that) big you google it, you'll find a video of Adam talking about the fact that only what a dentist does to whiten teeth actually works."
8851,"That mentioned nothing about toothpaste, just who had the whitest teeth within a group.  During that entire clip they never once mentioned anything about toothpaste or its whitening powers."
8852,I wish I had read this comment before watching that whole damned thing.
8853,Glad my memory didn't fail me!
8854,Well combine that with the above post about how whitening agents in toothpaste are abrasive and damage enamel and that's a pretty decent reason to avoid those pastes.
8856,My dentist said that there's such a tiny amount of hydrogen peroxide (if any at all) and you brush for teeth for such a small amount of time that it wont do anything. Unless maybe you leave it on your teeth for an hour or something.
8858,This is especially true(at least according to the instructions) on things like fluoride rinse.
8859,"But that's the directions on fluoride rinses. I can't recall ever reading ""do not rinse or drink for 30 minutes following use"" on toothpaste 
Edit: proof reading"
8860,"I skip the whitening toothpaste and use peroxide itself after brushing.  I let my teeth go for a long time because I'm a retard.  While they're still not movie-star white, they are back to the point of not being an embarrassment."
8861,"I use prescription fluoride toothpaste, because my dentist wants me to use a rinse but the rinses make me gag and vomit. The instructions on the toothpaste and in the literature from my pharmacy both go through the ""expectorate but do not rinse"" routine, and advise not to eat or drink for 30 min."
8862,"huh maybe that's because your toothpaste is prescription. I pulled my tube out and it says

**Directions**
Supervise children as necessary until capable of using without supervision
 Adults and children 6 years of age and older: brush teeth thoroughly, preferably after each meal or at least twice a day, or as directed by a dentist or a physician
Children under 12 years: instruct in good brushing and rinsing habits (to minimize swallowing)
Children under 6 years: Do not use unless directed by a dentist or a physician. Antiplaque and antiginigvitis use not proven in children"
8863,USE A PEA SIZED AMOUNT!
8864,Spread the knowledge! I swear if you used the amount shown in commercials you'd be buying a new tube once a month or sooner
8865,"Commercials lie. No one should ever follow what commercials do. Misleading consumer information. Charmin leaves ""Dingle berries"" I swear."
8866,Once a week I brush with hydrogen peroxide
8867,"Usually not hydrogen peroxide, *SOMETIMES* carbamide peroxide, and often a lesser oxide (that is more shelf stable). 

Basically hydrogen peroxide is about 3x as potent as carbamide peroxide, and (I apologize it's been 5 years since I worked with them) the lesser oxide is about 1/20th as potent as H2O2. Basically it lets them claim it's got whitening capability on the box, but it really doesn't do much

The amount of oxidation they provide is so insignificant that you won't see a difference. The whitening strips *kinda* work, but to get timely results, you really need to speak to a dentist and get something a bit more powerful.

As of 6 years ago, the highest H2O2 offered was 35% gel for use in dental offices, and 35% carbamide peroxide for in home tray use. don't know what they use now, I never want to see another dental picture again.

(I worked at DenMat, the company that created Rembrandt Toothpaste and also makes some fairly good dental products)"
8868,"Whitening toothpastes do work somewhat, but all they are is an abrasive. So, they take off part of your enamel (very slowly, but it can happen especially after drinking an acid like soda).

There is a difference between high end toothpastes. Some will have Stannous Flouride, which is much more superior to normal flouride and it is more expensive: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin%28II%29_fluoride"
8869,"I can't offer any definite answers other than for the brief period of time I used whitening toothpaste, my parents noticed a difference when I visited them and my dentist told me to stop because it would only make my cold/hot sensitivity worse.  Since I hate my teeth's sensitivity I stopped."
8870,"i use ecodent, no fluoride and my teeth are brighter than b4 and no fluoride is used"
8871,"This study suggests that toothpaste actually does not enhance the effect of brushing.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20657090"
8872,"It's also important to remember that if your municipality does not fluoridate your water, tooth paste is an important source of fluoride, even if it doesn't help with the mechanical cleaning of the teeth."
8873,Why do you need fluoride?
8874,"Proven to greatly reduce the occurrence of dental carries (cavities). You can get too much, in which case you get fluorosis."
8875,"there's a chemical process going on in your mouth at all times that replenishes the enamel on your teeth. this process normally binds calcium as part of the enamel. Fluoride can take calcium's place in this process, resulting in a more resistant enamel. Thus ensuring that your mouth is a fluoride-rich (in relative terms...) environment will result in stronger and healthier teeth.

Letting this process run its course uninterrupted is also one reason why you shouldn't snack between meals. 

source: my dentist told me."
8876,"Denist here. I don't are what toothpaste someone uses as long as it has fluoride in it. But watch out for the abrasive toothpastes, you will lose layers of enamel over time and that is what make your teeth strong and white!"
8877,Q: How do I know what toothpastes are abrasive?
8878,"Abrasive toothpastes are ones that contain Silicon Dioxide (aka quartz sand), hydroxyapatite, aluminium hydroxide or calcium carbonate. Pretty much all toothpastes contain some of these (although gels tend to have lower levels than chalky white toothpastes)."
8879,Why do they put that stuff in it if its bad for your teeth??
8880,"According to this link:

http://www.colgate.com/app/CP/US/EN/OC/Information/Articles/Cosmetic-Dentistry/Tooth-Whitening/Tooth-Whitening-Basics/article/Tooth-Whitening.cvsp#How_Its_Done

abrasives are the key component in whitening toothpastes that actually whiten teeth. And teeth whitening sells."
8881,"I'm using Colgate MaxWhite One Active (A whitening toothpaste) with the following ingredients:
Aqua, Hydrated Silica, Sorbitol, Glycerin, PEG-12, Pentasodium Triphosphate, Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Aroma, Cellulose Gum, Cocamidopropyl, Betaine, Sodium Fluoride, Sodium Saccharin, Xanthan Gum, Polyethylene, Sodium Hydroxide, Cinnamal, Limonene, CI 42090, CI 77891.

Is that one abrasive? And if yes: Will it damage my teeth when I use it daily? (It says to use it three times a day… I brush twice)."
8882,">**Hydrated Silica**

That's the abrasive."
8883,So how damaging is it? (See second part of my post)
8884,"Silica is the same thing as silicon dioxide, see above posts."
8885,"Doh, I guess I'll have to stop using it :-("
8886,Yes. Silica.
8887,"In that case, is peroxide abrasive? Since that's also a key component in teeth whitening."
8888,"No, peroxide is not an abrasive. it is an oxidizer."
8889,"NO, peroxide is not abrasive whatsoever."
8891,"Baking soda is not abrasive to tooth enamel, but is abrasive to a lot of the surface contamination you want to remove when you brush, so it's a fairly good in-between texture for brushing.  Another good thing about it is that it raises the pH in your mouth, which helps neutralize acidic etching of tooth enamel.

note:  I actually worked in the R&D lab that developed a popular baking soda tooth paste."
8892,">Neither Hydrogen Peroxide nor Baking Soda are abrasives in toothpaste.

-gilgoomesh said that down below"
8893,"No. Most dentists recommend that a toothpaste contain fluoride, but nothing abrasive.

If you examine the material used in abrasive toothpastes using something called the Charpy hardness test, you will find that these materials have a very high Charpy hardness rating; much higher than the rating of tooth enamel. Anything with a higher hardness rating will easily cause damage to something with a lower hardness rating."
8894,">Baking soda is an abrasive.

Posted by: **nallen** Synthetic Organic/Organometallic Chemistry"
8895,"So that means the more expensive, organic kinds are better for you?  I use Tom's of Maine, it doesn't appear to have aluminum or other whitening agents...for example, this one:

http://www.tomsofmaine.com/products/toothpaste/product-details/whole-care-toothpaste-gel"
8896,"What about hydrated silica, is that a problem?"
8897,I've used arm and hammer advanced whitening for as long as I can remember (told I have healthy teeth). Is the baking soda in this not considered abrasive?
8898,"Sometimes, enamel is yellowish. Whiteness doesn't correlate much with healthiness of teeth.

There'd a stereotype about British people having terrible teeth, but in truth they have a great dental system. But since they have public healthcare, dentists fix only what actually harms your health, and yellow or slightly jumbled teeth don't harm your health."
8899,"dentist here.  it is abrasive.  in fact, its very abrasive.  i usually recommend against it for that reason.  but do whatever YOUR dentist says, he's seen your teeth and i havent."
8900,"Okay, other people have said baking soda is not abrasive at all. Can someone clear this up?"
8901,"This is where the whole ""4 out of 5 dentists"" saying comes into play."
8902,Baking soda is abrasive. Some people use it in the kitchen not just for baking but also as a scouring powder.
8903,Baking soda is an abrasive.
8904,"Right, but the question in this context is whether it is an abrasive that is hard enough to damage enamel, which others have said it is not... It is 2.4 mohs, while enamel is 5 mohs - so (as far as I understand) it won't harm your enamel if your aren't pressure blasting your teeth."
8905,What about hydrogen peroxide?
8906,"Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidant and acts as a bleaching agent, but it is not an abrasive."
8907,Can you provide me with the name of a non abrasive toothpaste. This is kind of a ridiculous r/science thread where the people saying arm & hammer toothpaste isnt abrasive and getting upvoted
8908,"Outside of toothpaste uses, it's an abrasive. So why would this be different when combined with a toothpaste? I don't see how people claim it is not. Personally when i use baking soda toothpaste for a period of time my gums and mouth overall feel pretty scratched up and rough. This is enough evidence for me."
8909,">So why would this be different when combined with a toothpaste?

Enamel is pretty hard, it is possible that something less hard than tooth enamel is used as an abrasive in certain applications. That being said, it looks as though the consensus is that baking soda is abrasive to tooth enamel."
8910,What brand of toothpaste do you recommend?  What about any pharmacy products like SF 5000?
8911,"oh, and prescription fluoride rinses and toothpastes are useful in certain situations. definitely not for permanent use though."
8912,which toothpaste you use doesnt matter very much.  as long as it has fluoride.  i'd probably stick with one of the bigger brands though.  their products have a long documented history of effectiveness. happy cake day!
8913,"Some folks above seem to disagree with this, saying baking soda is abrasive to surface contaminants, but not enamel."
8914,"is this even possible? enamel is definitely more resistant to abrasion than surface contaminants.  but if a substance is abrasive, then its abrasive to everything, no?"
8916,"While I'm thinking about it this is a question I've had for a long time.

On the front of toothpaste (in the USA) it says ""Fluoride Toothpaste"" but if you look at the back it says a different active ingredient which I can't quite remember but I'm sure you know.  ~~I think it's sodium pyrophosphate from a quick google search.~~  Edit: It's Sodium Monoflourophosphate.

Why, if Fluoride is the most important thing, does it not show the active ingredient as Fluoride?"
8917,"This might be partially because there is no such chemical as 'Fluoride' on its own, it refers to the F^- ion in chemicals such as Sodium Fluoride, which is often found in toothpaste and mouthwash."
8918,"Ahh that makes sense.  I just got the tube and it says Sodium Monoflourophosphate.  I assume the flouro part of that is the flouride, right?"
8919,"Ya, the fl**uo**ro part is the fl**uo**ride."
8920,"Yes, that's correct, perfect."
8921,Are you thinking of sodium fluoride (NaF)?
8922,"Potassium Nitrate

They put it in toothpastes for sensitive teeth along with higher amounts of sodium fluoride.  From Sensodyne: Potassium Nitrate 5% (for antihypersensitivity), Sodium fluoride 0.13% w/v fluoride ion (for anticavity)."
8923,"So if one desires whiter teeth but doesn't want to wear down their enamel with abrasives, would you recommend getting teeth bleached?"
8924,"dentist here.  depends how much whitening you're looking for.  if its just a little, maybe try crest whitestrips or similar product over the counter.  if its more than a little, i'd recommend seeing your dentist and getting trays made, then tx with carbamide peroxide overnight for a week."
8925,"For someone that has sensitive teeth (the over the counter whiteners actually made my teeth HURT), how will the carbamide peroxide affect me?"
8926,"well it depends on the reason your teeth are sensitive. many people have sensitive teeth because they have had some gum recession and some of the root surface is exposed.  if OTC whiteners get on the root surface, that would be very sensitive.  but carbamide peroxide can be placed more carefully to avoid these areas.

if your teeth are just sensitive through the enamel, then carbamide peroxide will be cause more sensitivity than OTC whiteners.  everyone experiences some amount of sensitivity from whitening, thats normal.  but sensitivity isnt a sign of damage occuring.  my point is, if you think you can handle the sensitivity, then go for it.  but if you would rather not go through that, then dont.  it will probably be around twice as bad as the OTC sensitivity."
8927,I've never used the strips before - is the sensitivity persistent or does it subside after a while?
8928,"its temporary, maybe a couple days."
8929,"As a side not to thebageler's comment, I would also like to add that it can help to use a sensitivity toothpaste for 2 weeks before, during, and 2 weeks after tooth bleaching to curb the discomfort."
38718,Thanks for the info!
8931,I have dental fluorosis and it's embarrassing.  What you recommend the same thing for whitening in my case?  I need some pretty strong whitening.
8932,"fluorosis is tough to treat. even if you were able to whiten the rest of your teeth to the level of the fluorosis spots, that might be too white.  but thats pretty subjective.

you also have restorative options.  depending on how bad the fluorosis is, a dentist might either restore just the spots in composite resin, or the entire front of the teeth in question with porcelain veneers.  but whitening is the more conservative treatment."
8933,"Thanks a lot for responding.  In looking at pictures, I would say mine is considered ""mild"", but is visible on the front of many teeth.  I have avoided the composite route because I hear they only last a few years and will need to be capped or replaced with porcelain veneers.  I usually think it's going to be too troublesome or costly and just deal with it."
8934,Have you heard of the compound [NovaMin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NovaMin) and does it really work as intended?
8935,"I was under the impression that enamel makes your teeth strong and slightly yellow, which is the norm?"
8936,"Actually, enamel is the outer coating of the tooth (the white part). Why our dentist here says to watch out for abrasive toothpastes (and I'm sure he/she will agree when I say don't brush too hard) is that the enamel wears off and then the dentin shows which is yellow in color. 
The fluoride is used to protect from something called Dental Carries, which is basically bacteria in your teeth that digest sugar (from soda to bread) and produce an acid byproduct that erodes through the enamel, past the dentin, and to the sensitive nerve tissue (hence toothaches/cavities). 

http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/BHDTwo.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"
8937,"""The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white.""
Sorry for the wiki reference... :S , but I just think the cultural norm should be ""your teeth look best when they're natural!"""
8938,caries*
8940,"Sorry, my expertise ends at knowing how to spell 'caries'.

FWIW, from what I've heard from my dentists regarding a pretty fucked up tooth I have, the answer seems to be 'no'."
8941,"You can not ever get your lost enamel back. The dentin (yellow inner layer of your tooth) can be redeposited, but once the enamel is gone, it's gone. If your teeth are abraded, I recommend asking your dentist for a fluoride varnish to protect or remineralize the remaining enamel. Also, fluoride varnish seals your dentinal tubules which reach into your pulp (nerve portion of your tooth) and cause sensitivity. Here is an illustration of a [tooth](http://www.intelligentdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/P1.gif) structure to help you understand."
8942,"Lost enamel cannot be regenerated. Enamel that has begun to demineralize, but has not yet cavitated, can be remineralized with fluoride therapy, good oral hygiene, and a non-cariogenic diet."
8944,"yes it is necessary.  these two fluoride sources work by different mechanisms.  water fluoridation is most effective by incorporating fluoride into teeth while they are developing, before they erupt into your mouth.  fluoride in toothpaste then concentrates fluoride on the surface of the tooth, where cavities start."
8945,I was told (by a water treatment plant worker who adds fluoride) that adults do not benefit from fluoride and it is useless to them.  But that children most definitely do.  Any truth to that?
8946,"the benefit from water fluoridation is mostly for children.  but the benefit stays with you your whole life. so adults who grew up in fluoridated communities still have the protection.

the same can be said for the harmful effects as well.  overfluoridation is also a much bigger concern for children than for adults.  the level of fluoridation is picked very carefully so as to minimize these effects while maximizing benefit."
8947,"Is there a link to a study or anything of that sort to support this?

TL;DR - Citation Please."
8948,"Is it 'necessary'? It's not like a mineral that you ingest or anything, it helps by direct contact with teeth, in the mouth. After it is swallowed, it has 'minimal effect' according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_therapy .
So this means that 'every little bit counts' I suppose. Both toothpaste and fluoridated water will help, and the more contact time, the better."
8949,"Fluoride in water is mainly for children. It helps integrate fluoride in the teeth before they erupt into the mouth, resulting in a more decay-resistant tooth from the get-go."
8950,Have you heard of MI Paste? Father is a highly regarded cosmetic dentist and absolutely swears by the stuff.
8951,What happens when you get your teeth whitened?
8953,"Many dollar store toothpastes and kids toothpastes are loaded with sugar as well, so that's something to look out for."
8955,"No. In fact, the trend has been to continue professional fluoride treatments in-office for people who are high risk.

The teeth are in a constant cycle of either demineralization or remineralization. Tooth enamel is mostly made up of a crystal structure called hydroxyapatite. When the calcium is dissolved out of the structure, fluoride molecules bind the calcium present in your saliva and assist in re-integrating them into a new structure called fluorapatite, which is natually more resistant to future breakdown."
8956,"I read through like every comment in this thread an came up with this:

* Baking soda is an abrasive

* Fluoride is what makes a toothpaste any good

* Brushing without toothpaste is fine if you don't need the fluoride

* Pretty much all toothpastes other than those used to fight sensitive teeth are the same in terms of quality.

* Most effective way to whiten teeth by far is through a dentist.

* My Colgate Total probably doesn't really shield my teeth for 12 hours. (damn...)"
8958,"Baking soda is a very mild abrasive, compared to the silica/diatomaceous earth found in many tooth pastes.

It will keep your mouth basic for a long time though. Brush with it before bed, lightly.

Tooth Enamel has a mohs hardness of 5. Baking soda has a mohs hardness of 3. Its also water soluble."
8959,"In this age of ""ask your doctor if medication blah blah blah is right for you"", I'm amazed that people aren't a bit more skeptical of product claims. About 15 years ago suddenly almost all toothpastes claimed to whiten your teeth and control tartar and reduce gingivitis and freshen your breath and fight decay, all in one tube. I'm a dentist and I'm sure there are studies supporting these claims, but remember that manufacturers will exaggerate even the slightest purported benefit, however small, to get you to buy their product. Drug manufacturers have no problem massaging the data on something like statins to make them appear more effective, so it isn't a stretch to think that some data massaging is going on with toothpastes. Toothpastes help, but the action of the bristles is much more significant. The whitening claims are largely nonsense. The product is diluted with water right off the bat and it simply isn't on your enamel for a long enough period to have a whitening effect. If you hold a gun to my head, I guess I can look up some supporting studies, since this is r/science, but dental studies about toothpastes (dentrifices) are mind numbingly boring and I can hardly bring myself to even do a search. Sorry."
8960,"Okay, between this and other posts I'll buy that whitening doesn't work and that toothpastes stretch the magnitude of their effects as a selling point.

What about toothpaste for sensitive teeth?  My teeth are pretty sensitive, and whitening toothpaste actually gives me headaches after using it.  Because of this, I switched to a toothpaste for sensitivity.  Is there anything in these that could reasonably impact either immediate (as you're brushing) or longer-term (throughout the day, week, etc) sensitivity?  Or is it all a placebo?"
8961,"No, they help. The effect isn't immediate though. Whitening toothpastes can exacerbate sensitivity so set them aside and use a desensitizing toothpaste exclusively. Use them consistently for at least several weeks to a month. It takes awhile for the ingredient to build up in the tiny tubules (holes) that you have in root structure. If you haven't been to a dentist in a bit, make sure there isn't decay that is causing the sensitivity."
8963,"Yes, brushing with only water is quite effective and the difference between expensive vs cheap toothpaste is quite small to nonexistent. Fluoride in toothpaste is helpful at reducing decay, but for people who rarely or never get decay, because of a low sugar, non-cariogenic diet, it probably isn't essential. Toothpastes aren't useless, they help, some may reduce calculus accumulation a tad, but it is the action of either manual or sonic toothbrush bristles that physically breaks up plaque accumulation that is most important."
8964,"Yeah you could even just use a bar of soap to clean you teeth (or if you want a better tasting product you could use ToothSoap)

I've done it plenty of times when I didn't have toothpaste and I always found that it was more effective than toothpaste."
8966,Oh God.  I just pictured you taking a bath and washing your ass then brushing your teeth with that same bar of soap.
8967,"All One is liquid soap, thankfully."
8968,"That's an important distinction, it seems."
8969,I use it too. The Doggies smell like mint!
8970,"Are sonic toothbrushes more effective than manual toothbrushes? If so, to what degree?"
8971,"Degree would be hard to quantify, but I definitely think Sonicaire is better than a manual for most people. The sonic action extends beyond reach of bristles and blasts plaque out of hard to reach areas."
8972,this sounds like an ad for sonicare
8973,"A manual brush *can* be just as good as a powered brush, but the technique is hard to master for many people. Powered brushes are better because they eliminate a lot of the technique required to do a good job brushing."
8974,"So if I were to use mouthwash and floss, but brush with a sonic toothbrush and water I'd probably get the same (if not better) results than with brushing with toothpaste alone? Do people just expect that toothpaste is required because we've always been told to have it?"
8975,"My impression was along the lines of ""toothpastes are helpful"", but that manufacturers like to exaggerate to throw a half dozen benefits on the label"
8976,"Apart from fluoride which helps a bit, my understanding has always been that toothpaste is mostly useless. I've asked a couple dentists which ummed and aahed for a while before mumbling that all things considered, it might be better to use toothpaste. They didn't elaborate though."
8977,They control the acidic mouth Ph as well.
8979,"I would have to say it is a distinct possibility. [With this kind of thing going on, deliberate obfuscation doesn't seem like much of a stretch](http://www.nature.com/news/the-time-is-right-to-confront-misconduct-1.11085)"
8980,"""Toothpastes help, but the action of the bristles is much more significant.""

Maybe this is stretching too far beyond this thread's topic but...from this I gather that the toothbrush might be a better place to focus our Teeth Money. Is there something specific to look for when grabbing a brush, rather then looking at the toothpaste ingredients?

Personally, I find myself in the morning not using paste but just water as it makes my teeth ""feel"" more clean, but that surely is just personal preference."
8981,"Again, lots of marketing going on. I stopped trying to keep up with every new toothbrush 'innovation'. It seems that every few months there are all kinds of wacky handle and head shapes, bristle configurations and colors. I remember a time when a toothbrush was pretty standard fair with a garden variety design that didn't change much. I can't pinpoint the date when things went apeshit, but it was sometime in the 90's. Anyway, Oral B, Crest, Colgate, Reach all make effective manual brushes, but I personally use a Sonicaire electric, which I think is more effective for most people. Not that you can't get the job done with a manual. If your dentist likes your gum health and you've been using a manual, stick with it, but if your gum health could improve, I would consider the Sonicaire."
8982,Isn't Novamin the important ingredient to look for in toothpaste?
8983,"What about mouth wash? If toothpaste make little difference, one wonders if mouthwash isn't a total scam."
8984,"Mouthwash has the advantage of being liquid, which means it can reach areas that may be impossible to brush, such as when you have braces."
8985,Claims by mouthwash are mostly cosmetic (Gives you fresh breath!)
8986,"The Australian magazine Choice is quite good for this sort of thing.

8987,"There seems to be a few dentists here so I would like to present a question.  

My dentist suggested to me that toothpaste makes little difference.  The manual action of the bristles is what dislodges plaque and tartar.  Toothpaste is there for breathfreshening and contributes very little to actual cleaning.  Moreover he stated that flossing is much much more important.

Is there any merit in this?"
8988,"Look for one that uses Xylitol as its sweetener, it cannot be broken down by the bacteria, like others, and as such is antimicrobial. It is also low calorie!"
8989,As a related note: Don't swallow the toothpaste.
73043,Why not?
8991,This is why: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002745.htm
8993,"Also, too much fluoride when young can cause fluorosis. This can lead to severe staining on teeth. Which is a good reason not to swallow toothpaste, also for children not to take fluoride supplements. Too much fluoride can be as bad as too little."
8994,"""This article discusses the effects of swallowing a lot of toothpaste."" I'm guessing the amount you brush your teeth with doesn't qualify as a lot?"
8995,"A quick [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_poisoning) search reports:

>Referring to a common salt of fluoride, sodium fluoride (NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).

Equating sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate for convenience, and considering the 0.76% concentration of the latter in one commercial toothpaste, you'd have to swallow a little over 650 mL of the stuff at the low end to reach toxic levels (I know I'm mixing volume and mass here, but this is just really quick and dirty). That's 6 and a half regular-sized tubes. That's a *lot* of toothpaste, and considering that fluoride often produces stomach pains at a 15th or a 20th of toxic levels, it seems pretty unlikely that this is something you'd do by accident.

Basically, swallowing toothpaste is probably a bad idea generally, just because it's not really meant to be swallowed and you don't seem to gain by the act. However, it seems to be exceedingly unlikely that you'll end up with more than a tummyache or diarrhea, unless you're downing the stuff like spray-cheese."
8996,"Might be. Unfortunately I can't find a clear answer on that.

There are however examples of people suffering brain damage because their kidney's where unable to dispose of fluoride which resulted into a buildup on the long term.

My point is that it is definitely safer to spit out toothpaste. It was never designed to be consumed and it could be dangerous. Although clearly you are not in any immediate danger if you do so, otherwise a lot of people would be in trouble already."
8997,"The tubes themselves typically indicate that if you swallow more than what you would use to brush, to contact a poison control center or see a physician (2 pea sizes for adults, 1 pea size for kids typically).  Thus, I imagine if 3 pea sizes in one sitting is potentially harmful, that 2 pea sizes every day is likely to be if the substance isn't simply passed in its entirety, which it isn't."
8998,"Be really careful with Xylitol containing products if you have dogs, it is very poisonous to them. 

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol#Dogs"
8999,why would not being broken down cause it to be antimicrobial? That doesn't make much sense to me.
9000,"It eats the Xylitol, because its a sugar alcohol, and can't process or expel it. So they starve and die.

It is like when animals or small children eat lots of plastic, and can't expel it from their body."
9001,"I have to buy SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free toothpaste due to the fact that I have canker sores that are exacerbated by the detergents found in most toothpaste. I have to spend a bit more as a result.  

I dont really see another reason to spend more than a buck per tube on toothpaste, though. That ultra-brite stuff at walmart is just as good as colgate."
9003,"As much as I understand your desire to spread information. I have a hard time listening to dental-hygiene recommendations from someone whose mouth was in such poor shape.

I have some hands on experince in the dental world (as well as a familial connection to a renowned practice in the NYC area), and some of what you said is either A)common sense or B) partially correct.

There is a paste called GC MI Paste Plus... it contains a milk derived complex of casein phosphopeptides (CPP) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). As well as flouride. 

The MI Paste aids in maintaining the pH in your mouth, in the re-mineralizaton of the teeth and presents a reservoir of ionic calcium and phosphate at the tooth surface, among other things."
9004,"The active ingredients can differ. Stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride. [PDF source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1951625/pdf/pubhealthreporig00021-0087.pdf). Other toothpastes use sodium monofluorophosphate as their fluoride providing ingredient. You may notice some correlation between price and active ingredient, but it seems it mostly comes down to the marketing of the inactive ingredients. 

Here's a short list of some popular products and their active ingredient:

**Sodium Fluoride**: (most common)

* Aquafresh Ultimate White, Extreme Clean, etc.
* Rembrandt Intense Stain
* Crest (regular), Tartar protection, Crest Complete
* Colgate Triple Action, Colgate Total (also has triclosan)
* Aim
* Gleem
* Arm & Hammer
* Mentadent
* Sensodyne (also has Potassium Nitrate)

**Stannous Fluoride**:

* Crest ProHealth

**Sodium Monofluorophosphate**:

* Tom's of Maine Whole Care, Clean & Gentle, etc.
* Rembrandt Deeply White
* Aquafresh Cavity Protection
* Colgate Cavity Protection, Colgate Whitening Baking Soda

Note: I'm not a dentist nor toothpaste specialist or anything like that. I don't work for or have any affiliation with any company that does anything with teeth or toothpaste. Active ingredients were pulled from the listings on drugstore.com."
9005,"Does anyone have any good info on novamin (calcium sodium phosphosilicate)? I know it's got something to do with re-building enamel.

Also where might one get toothpaste containing it? best I could find in the store was burt's bees toothpaste, but novamin is only one of the inactive ingredients..."
9006,"just because it's listed as inactive doesn't mean it doesn't so anything.  they just aren't making any claims to its effectiveness.  I've been using Burt's Bees whitening for a few weeks and my sensitivity is way, way down.  Better than any sensitivity toothpaste i've ever tried in that respect."
9007,You can always check the active ingredients on the back of the box.  This works for comparing generic brand medications as well.
9008,There was a study published awhile ago (I'll find when I'm not on my phone) that found that brushing without toothpaste was more effective.

9018,"I use sensitivity toothpaste and I can tell a huge difference in the sensitivity of them when I use it versus when I use cheap regular shit like Aim. My orthodontist even recommended it to me so there has to be some truth in that, right?!"
9019,one thing I dont cheap out on is toothpaste. Never ever buy it from a dollar store
9020,"Dentist here. I suggest you brush with a fluoride toothpaste for two minutes at least twice a day using a soft bristled toothbrush. Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.  The mechanical action employed using the proper brushing technique is more important than the brand of toothpaste you purchase.
Contrary to what toothpaste commercials show, the amount of toothpaste or gel needed on your brush for effective cleaning should only be pea-sized. Flossing at least once a day is also very important because it removes food and plaque from between teeth where even the best toothbrush and toothpaste are ineffective. Studies show that plaque regrow on clean teeth about four hours after brushing."
9021,"Flossing saves your gums.  You'll notice this later in life if you haven't flossed.

One quick test is if you floss and you smell the floss and any part of it smells like death, that's kinda obvious.  If you floss just a few times a week, or up to once a day, parts of your mouth will no longer smell like death.

And they smell like death due to the stuff decaying in there between your teeth and gums as the bacteria lay down some nice cement and start to build their homes.  

FLOSS, DAMN YOU!

**EDIT:** plaque bacteria are like coral.  The plaque hardens to the calculus/tartar and the bacteria make their homes in there.  You're got a nice budding coral reef starting under your gums.  After your gums die off, the fish and eels can finally start moving in.  But really, the bacterial plaque hardens up due to the calcium ions in your salivia and forms a home for the bacteria to live in.  And this pushes away your gums and ligaments and then bone.  And the bone doesn't come back.

So, FLOSS DAMN YOU!"
9022,"Goddamnit, you have scared me into flossing. I should probably go buy some floss."
9023,"My dental hygienist also explained it thus:

it's not only the *visible* chunks of meat and crap that you get rid of by flossing, but also microscopic chunks of stuff that gets in between your teeth and can cause problems that you wouldn't even know about."
9024,"They are like coral.  The hardened plaque (calculus/tartar) is their home.  Built by them.  On your teeth and under your gums.

Pretty soon, the fish and eels will move in."
9025,"I'm just...I don't...do you...

Are you sure *calculus* builds up in your teeth?"
9026,"1. Let a and b be equal non-zero quantities

    a = b \,

2. Multiply through by a

    a^2 = ab \,

3. Subtract b^2 \,

    a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2 \,

4. Factor both sides

    (a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b) \,

5. Divide out (a - b) \,

    a + b = b \,

6. Observing that a = b \,

    b + b = b \,

7. Combine like terms on the left

    2b = b \,

8. Divide by the non-zero b

    2 = 1 \, 

Do you *really* want this shit in your gums? FLOSS."
9027,"FALSE. Dividing by (a-b) gives a divide by zero error.   a=b up top, so (a-b) = 0"
9028,That would be an interesting phenomenon.
9029,"When it stinks, don't let that stop you from continuing. And yes, it will smell like death.


Now imagine having to do it with braces."
9030,Having braces and no real motivation kept me from flossing :(
9031,Enjoy saving up for the thousands of dollars you will spend on your teeth later.
9032,Braces are the biggest pain to floss around
9033,"I recommend the floss picks.

These things are amazing!

9034,**I HAVE MICROSCOPIC EELS AND SHIT LIVING MA MOUTH!!!**
9035,I floss regularly and you still scared me.
9036,I have a way with people.
9037,I just flossed because of this. Actually.
9038,I'm going to right...now.
9039,I am actually going to the store to get some. Fuck this...
9040,"I didn't floss, I paid the price.

Seriously folks, you think dentists are scary?  Try periodontal surgery.  [Have someone cut your gum away from the jawbone, peel it back, grind down the decayed and rotten *bone* then sew your gums back on again.(NSFL)](http://i.imgur.com/pdVy7.jpg)"
9041,"FINE, I'LL FUCKING FLOSS. FUCK YOU."
9042,Just think of all the dragon breath you won't have when you are trying to score with a hot chick.
9043,"Married, so I found a hot chick that is into gum disease...which means she'll dump me if I floss.  

Woohoo! I found a reason not to floss!"
9044,Not sure if blatant lie or so ridiculous it's true...
9045,Had this done.. Sadist of a dentist held a mirror in front of my face to show me what i had done mid-surgery and while i was a little loopy from the opiates it still burned an image in my mind. Never went back to that guy....
9046,Picture 2 actually looks like someone has flossed for an hour as hard as possible. Just ripped apart the gums
9047,"Also, if you don't floss, all the gum disease will destroy your gums and leave gaping holes in between your teeth. The tissue will never grow back."
9048,"This is why I'm really scared. Why won't it grow back!? I have minor gum loss from brushing too hard, and now there are gaps between my teeth that were never there before. Now I'm scared to brush my teeth (do it anyway), but trying to floss every day."
9049,"Those individual plastic flossers turned me back into an avid flosser after not doing so for over 15 years. 

Highly recommended, would floss again."
9050,">Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.

Dude

What

I have the exact opposite problem. I sort of lose track of time and go ""hmmm i don't feel like I brushed this tooth enough"" and I end up brushing my teeth for like 8 minutes"
9051,You're probably going to be causing more harm than good with that method.
9052,"it's not a constant thing, although I don't time myself most days, it's *probably* close to 2-3 mins, maybe more in the mornings because with each stroke I am cursing the gods and wishing I was still asleep

you know regular stuff"
9053,"This is why I love using an electronic toothbrush, because it has a timer on it. Some days it feels like I have been brushing for ages, yet it will be quite a while before the timer goes! So I know I would have 'cheated' if I was using a manual brush in that case."
9054,"I brush my teeth while high, too."
9055,"> Flossing at least once a day is also very important because....

[What's that?](http://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/667.jpg)"
9056,"I never used to floss.  At age 35 or so my gums started receding and my teeth became incredibly sensitive to anything hot or cold, like tap water or coffee.  It took me a good five years of flossing every day to get my gums back in order.

Five years of agony every day because I didn't floss for 20 seconds daily.  Stupid me."
9058,6 months! He's good.
