31936,"OPKS is soul crushing, all of the East Coast SPG hotels I've stayed in have been awesome."
31938,"Better elite status recognition, breakfast (actual breakfast not continental breakfast), upgraded suites etc. Often with fewer hurdles to go through than Marriott.  I think Marriott Platinum is something like 75 nights a year whereas starwood platinum is 25 stays or 50 nights.  Amex Platinum gives you Starwood Gold status for having the card.

Starwood lifetime gold status is 250 nights total (including award stays) and 5 years of having gold status (which you can get from the amex card or 30k spend per year), so it's easily attainable from any business traveler whereas Platinum is 500 nights."
31939,"If you get the ritz card and spend 10k a year you got gold status which is normally 50 nights. If you add the Marriott card you get an extra 15 nights towards platinum, plus you get an extra night for each 3k you spend on the card. Most ppl can do 10 nights or less to get platinum. Gold gets you free breakfast and internet plus late checkout"
31940,"It also has a $395 annual fee (200 for airline reimbursement) compared to the $95 citi reserve, which comes with hilton gold for free.  It's 40k to diamond compared to 75k for Marriott Diamond for the Ritz Carlton.  Where are you getting that it's only 10 nights for platinum?  15 nights towards platinum for the card, and then 3k for each elite night.  If you're implying that the Ritz Carlton counts as 50 nights right off the bat, I seriously doubt that happens as most of the other hotel programs don't operate this way.

Also the SPG comes with 5 nights/2 stays towards elite status, if you have both business and personal that's 10 nights/2 stays and still cheaper than the Ritz Carlton Card."
31941,"The Ritz Reimbursement for airline incidentals is now $300. You also get unlimited lounge club access. You also get 3 club level upgrades at the Ritz each year. If you get the Ritz card it gives you gold status at both Ritz and Marriott. If you then apply for the Marriott card and write down your Marriott number you get an extra 15 elite qualifying nights. Gold status is normally 50 nights at Marriott. Platinum status is normally 75 night at Marriott. 

You will get gold status at both Marriott and Ritz every year you spend 10k on your Ritz Card."
31942,"So you're saying that with Ritz Carlton card you hit 10k spend, which equals gold = 50 nights.  Then the Marriott Card adds 15 nights, so 65 elite qualifying nights.  Have you done this before or are you speculating because I can't think of any other hotel program that counts status in this way."
31943,"Well I called Chase and they suggested that is how it would happen since it shares the same Marriott account number. If you have other data points let us know. It makes sense it would happen this way since you can have a Marriott rewards account without any credit cards 

Also, the difference between platinum and gold are not great in terms of perks. Even if you had Ritz Card Gold status and no Marriott card you would get platinum at Marriott after 25 nights I think"
31944,"I'd call up Marriott directly.  Chase reps don't know how the cards work or the loyalty programs, they're not educated on the cards like we are.  A lot of times when they asked why you want this card, many people would tell the chase reps something new they didn't know.  Their job frankly, is to push the machine to manually approve you if you're a risk.

Most other hotel programs for example, Hilton give you gold, but require you to start at the bottom if you want Diamond through stays.  Same with starwood, the only program that doesn't do this is club carlson, where if you already have status they will give you 10 nights towards keeping it.  


https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/club-carlson-rewards-visa-signature-credit-card.html

On my hilton account, it shows I have hilton gold, but my stays this year have so far been 0 this year so it shows 0 stays, 0 nights, not 40 as I would have with gold.

Also, you can have status programs without a credit card.  I have Hyatt and Club Carlson accounts, most people who aren't churners earn points/status through stays and not spending."
31945,"You might be right, I do not know a lot about hotel programs. I think that Ritz gold status is good enough for me though. Gold status gets you free breakfast or club lounge access at Marriott. Most of the Marriotts seem to have the lounges. If you bill everything to your room it is not too hard to spend on the Ritz card at the 5x bonus rate. Spending 10k a year on the Ritz card to keep gold status does not seem that hard. You also get free internet at Marriott. You also get free room upgrades where available"
31946,Perhaps you can make sense of this explanation http://viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2013/07/11/you-have-to-pick-just-one-should-you-be-a-marriott-rewards-or-ritz-carlton-member/
31947,"The Marriott Platinum Challenge is pretty easy to do http://loyaltylobby.com/2014/03/13/marriott-rewards-taste-of-gold-platinum-elite-status-fast-track-offers-2014/

Nine nights in three months, get platinum to 2016"
31948,"I am a former Starwood Platinum...  While I have never had Hyatt or Marriott status, I have had HHonors Diamond and am currently IHG Platinum. I find that SPG's Platinum bests Hilton and IHG top-tiers for perks and recognition.  SPG has also added new perks for high-volume plats like anytime check-in and a few confirmable suite upgrades, as well as lifetime gold and platinum tiers.

I am currently going for lifetime gold but it taking longer than I had hoped, partially due to less travel than anticipated but also the miniscule number of SPG properties compared to other chains. It seems like most markets have a tons of IHG, Marriott, and Hilton properties with a couple SPG hotels and even fewer Hyatts."
31949,"Starwood is almost exclusively premium hotels.  They have much nicer but fewer hotels than hilton or Marriott.  

I do a lot of business travel and if I went to more major metros rather than Podunk little towns, I would absolutely go with Starwood."
31950,"Hilton quality varies wildly, and doesn't seem to correlate with price. The cheapest Hilton I've been in has been really nice, and the most expensive was the shittiest hotel I've ever been in."
31951,"Starwood has some damn nice hotels, and their points transfer nicely to other things if you end up with tons of them. Its my understanding that you can transfer them 1:1 to a lot of airlines (although I haven't), and they also have some good promos."
31952,"> Its my understanding that you can transfer them 1:1 to a lot of airlines (although I haven't), and they also have some good promos.

I believe you can transfer them 4:5 to Delta (4 starwood points = 5 delta points)"
31953,"What airline do you use, consultant here too (though only ~30% of the time traveling) and doing delta/hilton so far but looking to change."
31954,"Hyatt has some really nice properties, especially the Park Hyatts. Most Hilton's are pretty basic, but the Waldorfs and Conrads are nice. Starwood also has some great properties. Fairmont has some REALLY nice properties but there aren't very many of them."
31955,"If you are talking about which has the best high-end hotels, they've nearly all got some good ones.

Marriott has a ton of great category 9 hotels which are amazing.  These are typically 'JW' properties.  They also partner with Ritz Carlton so you can stay there with marriott points.

SPG has very nice properties imo.  Some of the W locations in big cities are excellent, although I haven't stayed at many (i usually transfer SPG points).

Hyatt has a lot of great high end stuff, especially the various Grand and Park Hyatts.

Hilton has the 'Conrad' hotels which are typically very, very nice.

Fairmont is a niche brand but they probably have the best average hotel, as everything they do is basically luxury."
31956,"There is no best. Every city has a wide variety of hotels in different locations. One chain does not have a monopoly on the nicest hotels, the best value hotels, or the nicest locations. Each location is generally independently owned and operated. And generally the platinum/elite hotel perks aren't enough to merit exclusivity (unlike airlines).

I prefer Marriott's because they offer good value (especially with the corporate discount codes available) at courtyards and marriotts. JWs internationally are nice and generally affordable. Starwoods are often over priced and offer diminishing returns in terms of value, but offer many more high end options (Westin, W, St. Regis). ICH varies widely-- there are some amazing ICs, but some abysmal holiday inns."
31957,"Depends on what you mean by best. I have had the best, most luxurious experience at a Four Seasons (Lanai, Hawaii). I dont think they have a rewards program, though.

I have heard that for overseas, IHG and Club Carlson have a lot of properties and good reward program redemption rates.

For domestic US hotels it really depends on whether you value quality (i.e. luxury) or quantity (i.e. cheap redemption values)."
31958,"I don't know if Marriott is the best, but I've never been disappointed in one. For me it's really about meeting a basic level of cleanliness and professionalism, then everything else is bonus. About 7 years ago all the mid-tier Marriots (Springhill, Courtyard, etc) seemed to have been revamped to pretty cool modern designs too.

I'm probably out of date since it's been nearly 10 years since I did regular business travel, but back then I actually jumped from Hilton to Marriott as the mid-tier Hilton chain near my project was always dirty. Discovering that I earned free nights from Marriott at more than twice the rate per stay was just an added bonus. (Again that was 10 years ago, the rewards part may have changed)"
31959,"I swear to god, I'm not singling you out or anything but every single person that talks about Marriott talks about its consistency and always mentions something along the lines of ""its never disappointed me.""  This is the 3rd time now, if I was more paranoid I'd cry that it's a corporate shill, but I'm content to say that it's just a weird coincidence.  Marriott has some diehard fans."
31960,"Good point... I haven't had status with Marriott but I used to deliver training at a Marriott conference center. Marriott handled the catering, a/v, and on-site student housing.  Employees were nearly always on the ball, and of the Marriott properties I have stayed at, none of them have been dirty or have had poor service."
31961,"Totally not a corporate shill. 

If this helps prove it, I'll give my only major Marriott complaint. I eventually accumulated over a million Marriott points. Used them to pay for my wife and I and another couple to get 2 rooms at a Costa Rican Marriot resort, and get $1000 in ""Marriot Cash"". Our other friends paid for a 3 day eco-lodge and the airfare and we considered the cost about equal. American Airlines was terrible and almost ruined our trip (unrelated, I just fucking hate AA). The eco-lodge was *amazing* perhaps the best 3 days I've had in my life. The Marriott Resort was crappy. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it, but I flew 2000 miles to hang out with douchey Americans in a walled off beach resort. Totally soured me for aspiring to get massive future Marriott points. I stopped major business travel soon after, so it was something of a moot point.

To this day I still probably have 100K points, which is great, any time I'm on a road trip near a Marriott I can stay free, which is great. But the higher Tier Marriott resorts just aren't worth it IMO, you'd be better off paying cash for a non-branded place to stay.

TL;DR All Marriott's are good enough. Mid-tier Marriots are awesome, but high tier Marriott's just aren't worth the money/points."
31962,"What's the name of the eco lodge if you don't mind me asking?  It's funny how it seems opposite with Hilton now.  Their mid level hotels are terribly priced, like 60k points for a 200 dollar room, yet 95k points for a $1000 dollar room in Koh Samui or Conrad Tokyo.  

When you compare to Hyatt which earns about 1x on its credit card and caps at 30k and Hilton which earns at 3x but caps at 95k, Hilton is still good for the expensive hotels, but is terrible for redeeming at mid levels."
31963,"La Paloma http://www.lapalomalodge.com/
When we went 8 years ago, I think it was $100/person/night all inclusive off-season. Seemed kinda expensive (esp compared to free for the Marriott), but given that it was about 50 times better it was really a bargain.

Edit: Looks like their rates have more than doubled. Still probably awesome though."
31964,"oh man, I really have to disagree.  You must have stayed at a really shitty place, but the high tier Marriott properties are BETTER than just about anything else.

Firstly, Costa Rica.  Come on.  You aren't getting their best hotel in Costa Rica. Try the category nine hotels in europe like the Grosvenor House in london, or the Champs-Elysees Marriott in paris.  Those are 600-700 bucks a night hotels and they're amazing.  And if you REALLY hate the marriott brand, you can use marriott points to stay at Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide, which are also typically stunning.

Marriott has some extremely good high end properties."
31965,"That's fair, I've never stayed above a Cat V and my complaint is probably more one of preference than quality (I'm just not a resorty kinda guy). I did feel like that Costa Rican resort was just there so entitled business travels could burn their extra points on a beach vacation (i.e. they were going to get the customers either way, so why try too hard)."
31966,Many would argue that south/central american properties for any hotel chain are not worth redeeming at (for high end).  SE asia DESTROYS in this regard
31967,I love marriott. I have a huge travel perk with them though by getting rooms at employee prices. Spent a week in Hawaii in a two bedroom suite for $104 a night instead of 349. Started churning to take advantage of it more often. I agree that marriotts are always clean and comfortable. Never had a bad experience with them.
31968,"I like Hilton, the perks I get for being Gold are pretty nice (free breakfast and/or bonus points depending on the brand, free upgrades, free internet) and there are Hiltons all over the place. Plus they have an app where you can check in ahead of time and choose your room and whatever amenities you'd like to have waiting in your room when you get there. And the points-plus-$$ options are great. 

We stayed at a resort in Scotland a few weeks ago, that I originally booked for 20k points, but then decided to go with the 8k points plus approx. $45 to save the extra 12k points for a later date. Between the free upgrade, breakfast, internet, and the kids eat free (dinner and breakfast), we ended up saving around $400 over what we would have paid for it all. For one frickin night. That was definitely worth the 8k points and $45."
31969,"Best, as in nicest? Probably a toss up between Hilton and Hyatt I guess."
31970,Do they offer a free anniversary night?
31971,"Hyatt offers cat 1-4 every year.  Hilton offers gold status with its card (free internet, free breakfast for 2, room upgrades etc.  Everyone always underestimates the breakfast benefit, in many places they're full breakfast buffets or restaurants, saving you probably at least 30-50 dollars each morning) whereas Hyatt offers lower tier status.  Hilton Reserve offers any weekend night (Fri, Sat, Sun) if you spend 10k on its card.  The coupon expires within 1 year.  If you sign up now, they're running a $100 statement credit, making the first year freeish.

Hyatt only has about 500 hotels to IHG, Marriott or Hilton's 5000 each though, so if you want a hotel that's almost everywhere, pick one of those.  IHG, Marriott also offer free nights, though IHG is on any hotel and Marriott is cat. 1-5, though Marriott has significantly less hotels in 1-5 range than Hyatt does with 1-4."
31973,"Uh.... ok... Or you can just got IHG, Club Carlson, Marriott and Hyatt and get one free night cert. every year. The Club Carlson is just points, but it's nearly enough for one free night at a Category 5 hotel. 

To clarify, I'm sure OP was referencing anniversary night associated with the credit card....as this is the churning subreddit. Jesus christ is this subreddit still that bad?"
31974,Those are all the ones that give you a free night every year?
31975,"I agree with strawboy that OP meant anniversary of his card, not his wedding."
31976,"I think Sheraton is also consistently good. For whatever reason, Marriott never appealed to me though."
31977,"Yea. Marriott is good for having a ton of choices here in the US, but rarely are their properties aspirational."
31978,"Ritz Carlton has the nicest hotels, but there is no free anniversary night. The Ritz card is good for getting gold status though both at the Ritz and Marriott chains"
31979,"Ah, never stayed in a Ritz so I wasn't familiar."
31981,I think you are thinking about Club Carlson. Ritz only does a percentage annual points bonus
31982,You know what - you are right my bad.
31983,"It depends on what you want to do with your hotel points. After just under two years with Marriott, I have 3/4 points to get a Harley - Davidson. That's without a Marriott rewards credit card."
31984,"Mostly agree, but the ones you listed as upper class are not really upper class, they’re like higher middle class- 3 star max. Upper class would be like 4 & 5 star hotels."
31985,"Yeah, I’d only call them upper class motels.  The distinction isn’t the easiest to make, but you’re gonna find an embassy suites in a ton of places including smaller towns while you’ve never gonna find a JW Marriott on a road trip unless you’re driving through downtown."
31986,"Best Westerns have different categories (Plus, Premier, etc.) Amenities and service levels vary a lot depending on the type of property."
31987,"They're also almost all individually owned and brand under Best Western mainly as advertising.  Huge, huge variance in the properties."
31988,Oh did not know that
31989,"Usually works best staying at one chain to build up status.  I’m a fan of the Marriott chain. Fairfield / Springhill for economy, Residence Inn is great with kids, bigger rooms.  Marriott / Renaissance for a nice stay.  All there luxury hotels are pretty nice."
31991,+1. Marriott is usually where I stay for work. I had one issue during a recent stay and they fixed with with no hassle asap.
31992,"Most of these are franchise chains, and the quality is only as good as the franchisee.

While I usually stay at Hampton Inn on road trips, I've been to a number of the others as well.  I like Hilton's program that 5th night a stay is free.

I've never had a bad experience at a Comfort Inn or a La Quinta.

My most recent stay was at a Hilton Garden Inn, and it was fine.  The room was no smaller than most."
31993,I’ll give you an upvote for spending 40 minutes on a Reddit post. What’s your definition for upper class though? Premium?
31994,I have low standards for hotels. So my definition is basically the more expensive out of the 3 star variety
31995,"Thank you for posting this with affordable chains. I see a lot of ""should I pick ABC luxury hotel or XYZ waterfront Airbnb?"" on travel forums so it's nice to see the other side."
31996,"Motel 6 is generally my go to on the road, especially when I traveled with my dog. It's simple and not expensive. Im there to sleep thats it."
31997,"The simply Sonesta i stayed in Utah was great. It had a stove with plenty of pots and pans. A full sized fridge. A king size bed. Clean shower. A free laundry room with a little convenience store sort of thing they called the cupboard. There was a gym as well.

It was $58 a night but felt like it should have been twice that."
31998,"Thanks for the list.  I agree with most of your choices.  Knights Inn is the worst.  I naively booked one on a business trip and immediately checked out after getting a room with a cracked window, saggy bed, and reeking of patchouli.   The hoopties in the parking lot should have been a clue that I was in a sketchy place.   I drove around in my rental car until I found a decent hotel.  I would have slept in my car if necessary over staying at that Knights Inn.

I’m a fan of Embassy Suites.  I have had many good experiences there."
31999,"BONUS: Extended stay hotels ranked:

Economy:

InTowne Suites. 2/10. Dirty. The knights inn of extended stay hotels.

Woodspring suites. 4/10. basically travelodge of extended stay hotels.  


Extended Stay America 6/10 Basically the motel 6 of extended stay hotels

Middle Class:

Sonesta ES Suites. 7/10. Good extended stay properties.

Hyatt House. 7.5/10 Good extended stay hotels especially for families but not as good as residence inn. 

Residence inn. 8/10. good hotels for families."
32000,"I don’t have much experience in the budget category, but I like your recommendations on the upper end.

Drury Inn and Embassy Suites in particular are my go-tos."
32002,"I tend to avoid the low budget hotels.  My typicak go-tos are Hyatt Place (esp if they have 5000 point award rate), HIEX or Fairfields.

If going internationally, I like ibis hotels."
32003,"I've stayed at most of those and I think I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. Hampton used to be our go-to, but now it's becoming Hyatt Place. As chains go, I love staying at Embassy the most."
32005,I consider those upper class. but I kind of have low standards. So that’s probably why.
32006,What do you consider upper class?? And middle class isn’t quality inn/Comfort inn That’s lower class
32007,"Comfort Inn to me was always a little better and cleaner, than a Quality Inn. For sure they were similar to say like a Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn, to me. OTOH you're right about Quality Inn sadly, where with them you never know if you'll run into a good or not so good ran one.

Some people have said Comfort Suites(also same parent company as Comfort Inn, Quality Inn, etc, which I think is Choice) is supposedly a slight bit better than Comfort Inn, but I've never stayed at one for myself."
32008,"Ashford Castle in Ireland.

I mean, it’s a literal castle. What’s not to like? 

It had the most beautiful pool and spa area. The tea service was excellent. I felt like I was a lady in Downton Abbey. I took a falconry lesson on the grounds. Overall amazing experience. It was like living out my girlhood fantasy."
32009,Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun! How was Ireland when you visited?
32010,"Answering as another Ireland visitor. The best way to do it is to stay somewhere new every night at B&Bs. The best places to go are Dublin to Glendalough, to the ring of Carrey, to cahergill ring fort, to newgrange

It's amazing"
32011,I stayed at the Intercontinental in Dublin and it was divine! Changing accommodations every night sounds like a big hassle.
32012,It's easy if you book ahead. It also let's you see the countryside and meet more people
32013,I'd include Killarney National Park to that list. Unworldly beautiful.
32014,I love Killarney. Definitely worth the trip. The city of Kilkenny is also beautiful.
32015,"I’m not OP, but Ireland was the best! I’ve traveled all over the world and it remains in my top 3 trips!"
32016,That sounds amazing. I’ve always wanted to visit Ireland.
32017,Ireland does a great job in tourism!
32018,I stayed there too. Enjoyed it so much I changed my flight time back to England just to make the most out of relaxing. Totally worth getting a flexi ticket.
32019,I stayed there as well! It was fantastic. A favourite was seeing the Irish wolfhounds they had in the lobby in the morning.
32020,Is Ashford castle a hotel built purposely to imitate a castle or a hotel built on an old castle
32021,"Medieval castle, turned into a hotel"
32022,This is my dream
32023,I *love* the LINE Hotel in DC. My husband and I stayed there for our anniversary. It's in an old restored church and the rooms are very unique - plus it had a claw foot tub. The customer service was also wonderful. It's definitely one of the more unique hotels I've ever stayed in.
32024,"This is very European. In the south of France they’ve turned a lot of monasteries and former convents into high end hotels. My favorite was one in Lyon because it was the most aesthetically pleasing hotel I’ve ever been in, clean clean clean and so symmetrical, perfection! And the food was amazing."
32025,"It is very common in Europe. And old buildings in general obviously. 
There is also a lovely former monastery turned hotel in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
32026,Talked about going to DC with my bf yesterday and looked up that hotel and will probably stay there next year because if you! Looks beautiful!
32027,Thank you for asking! Reading through all the comments shows me I need to travel more!
32028,Four seasons in HK. Watched the new years fireworks from the infinity pool. Truly a once in a lifetime kinda thing
32029,"I was going to say the Four Seasons in Budapest. The building itself is a work of art, and I'm a big fan of art nouveau in general but the building was on a whole level of it's own in terms of artistry and quality.
The rooms were spacious and had ~12' ceilings (I'm not great at estimating height but they seemed higher than what most people call ""high ceilings""). Each room had it's own doorbell which was novel.
 And the rooms looked over the Danube onto the other side of the city with the castle and historical district. My aunt's room had a balcony with the view and my room had a wide stone ""windowsill"" with windows that opened like French doors so I could sit on the windowsill while admiring the view."
32030,You’re making me want to go to Budapest just to experience this!
32031,Go anyway and stay anywhere because it’s amazing!
32032,"Go, seriously. It’s awesome. Also spend a day in one of the Roman baths. Soooo relaxing!"
32033,That sounds like fun! How was Hong Kong?
32034,HK is such a cool city!
32035,I love that hotel so much. My husband and I had our first date there <3
32037,"Nothing fancy or exotic, but I will always love the Home Hotel in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho. The rooms are very nice and reasonably priced, and it’s right across the bridge from some public hot springs. Even better - the hotel rooms have their own jacuzzi style bath tubs (large enough for two people) that are connected to the hot spring system. 

The two times I’ve stayed there, the service has been incredible, and the owners surprised the guests with homemade baked goods each morning, even though they don’t offer a continental breakfast or whatever. For a little middle-of-nowhere tourist trap of a town, this hotel is what keeps me coming back.

Edit: I forgot one of the best features! Each room is themed after a famous artist! My favorite room is the Gustav Klimt room."
32038,"This is so wholesome, thank you for the info!"
32039,Lava Hot Springs is also a fun place to spend the 4th of July. I grew up in southern Idaho and my friends and I would go there for the fireworks and the Thai restaurant.
32040,Oh I love going to that place! Haven't been there since I was a teenager but I remember having a lot of fun :)
32041,"Probably a once and a lifetime opportunity, I was invited on a trip by a female friend to the Caribbean and this little resort called Anse Chastanet, you can only get to it via helicopter or sea plane as the roads are awful. I'm used to hotels like best western which are normal, but this place was super posh. I think the best part was how peaceful it was, it was so removed from busy society, also the fact that I didn't have to pay for it as my friend had pretty much begged me to come, and is pretty loaded.

I highly doubt ill be able to go to another place that posh again with my own finances."
32042,"hey! not to be rude or insult your intelligence, but the phrase you're looking for is ""once in a lifetime""! i always get phrases like this wrong (comes from having parents who are non-native english speakers), too"
32043,"Hotel Xcaret in Mexico. It was listed in Times Magazine as one the top 100 placed to travel in 2018. It also has the only Michelin star chef in Mexico. We liked it so much, we just booked our second trip."
32044,"Nice, I'm taking my family there in a couple of weeks!"
32045,You’re going to love it!!!!
32046,I love Xcaret! Thanks for bringing it up
32047,Where in Mexico is it?
32048,Playa Del Carmen
32050,I hope you get a chance to stay somewhere just as nice soon.
32051,I always wanted to stay there or at the Contemporary.
32052,Ritz Carlton in Battery Park.. wowee that was fancy.
32053,"Ooh I bet! I’ve always heard the Ritz Carlton hotels were on another level, practically a 6 star hotel, if you will"
32054,"The level of service is incredible. My parents are kind of bougie and stay there when they travel places, on one of their anniversaries a few years ago, my sisters and I got them tickets to a Show. We knew they were going out for dinner and wanted the hotel people to have the tickets waiting for them when they come back. When I called the hotel to ask, the greeted me ""hello Mr samwise141 how can we help"" I have no idea to this day how they knew my name."
32055,"My sister works in the (separately chef owned) restaurant of the ritz in our city. The kind of stuff they learn during the hiring process is insane, there’s a whole bunch of stuff they aren’t allowed to say (probably not super accurate example: “ I will access that for you” instead of “let me look that up for you”) and the staff of the ritz consider themselves “ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.” 

Still couldn’t justify staying at one even with her employee discount though."
56457,How so?
32057,"The decadent interior design, the quality of the food... I had a steak and it was cooked to perfection - I still remember it nine years later!"
32058,Unfortunately no longer a Ritz-Carlton hotel. Same owners as the Central Park hotel and it was loosing tons of money.
32059,"The Brando, in Tahiti. I went there several times for work. Although I wouldn't really call it a hotel...more like a luxe resort.

We had a butler, private beach, the food was incredible, etc. It was amazing."
32060,Ok we gotta know what you do for work.
32061,I was the marketing director for a company that took their top salespeople there every year :)
32062,"Hah, named after Marlon Brando. He filmed a movie in Tahiti and he loved it there, so it doesn’t surprise me."
32063,Tahiti is a magical place

32065,Marina Bay sands in Singapore. The infinity pool and the city view from the room are amazing
32066,"I prefer The Fullerton, and even the Shangri La in Singapore as hotels. Can't beat the pool at the Marina Bay Sands though!"
32067,That place is on my bucket list!
32068,"The Mira Hotel in Hong Kong. 

Apart from the basic amenities they have (e.g.: mini bar, complimentary water, coffee and tea, hairdryer, bath tub, etc), what I loved about it is their Pillow Menu. And they're all complimentary. You can request for a full body pillow, a lavender or rose-infused pillow, a hypoallergenic pillow and others. They have like around 6 kinds of pillows to choose from besides the two regular pillows included. I asked for a lavender-infused pillow and a full body pillow and they are glorious to use.

I know one of my coworkers tried to request for 6 pillows and her bed started to look and feel like a coffin lol. But she says she had the most amazing sleep."
32069,"When I was roughly 13 or so years old, my parents went to a silent auction that was being held by the company my father worked at. This company is a subsidiary of Warren Buffet’s so many, very wealthy people are employed.

Anyway, one of the items up for bid, was a trip where the winners would stay at a private villa on the Mediterranean Sea somewhere on the coast of Italy (can’t remember exactly where) my parents bid on the trip and ended up winning. I don’t remember exactly who the man was that owned the villa, but obviously someone stupid rich. 

This was a magnificent villa, straight out of the movies type of shit. Complete with a live in staff of 3 and a private beach/cove down from a cliff that you accessed via golf cart. We spent our days swimming in our own private  Mediterranean beach....what. 

The woman staff member, Angela, was the cook. An incredibly kind hearted woman. On that trip I ate some of the best food of my entire life and drank homemade limoncello every night. These meals were marathons. Course after course of the best Italian food I have ever had. Nothing I’ve had either in the states OR Italy for that matter has come even remotely close. 

Definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity, that I am eternally thankful that my parents were able to provide for me. I’ve had some other incredible travel experiences, but nothing that even comes remotely close. I think my brother still has the limoncello recipe written down somewhere, definitely need to find that one."
32070,"Top 3:

1) Shangri-La in Mactan, Philippines -- oh my God this place was amazing.

2) Sheraton-Moana Surfrider in Oahu, HI-- I believe it's now the Westin? It definitely changed names since I've been there. It's a BEAUTIFUL old hotel, amazing history and just a great hotel.

3) Sheridan Beach Resort and Spa, Palawan, Philippines-- it takes so long to get there (travel to the Philippines, plane from Cebu, hours long drive), but it is SO WORTH IT."
32071,My #2 choice is the Makati Peninsula!
32073,"Upvote for the Moana. Have afternoon tea there, it's a beautiful experience."
32074,"ITC Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad, India. Breath taking experience.  Some highlights: 

1. Best hospitality I have seen, even for Indian standards.
2. Rich culture and Nizam heritage to the palace.  The hotel(Palace) is filled with opulence. The richest person in the world for most of 19th century lived there.
3. Amazing food !!! You think you know about Indian food? Think again!
4. A+ list in the dinner guest list. You will be surprised with the guests in your adjacent dinner table. 

This was sponsored to me by a family member. Best experience of my life :)"
32075,"You went to India??!! How was it?

How was the hospitality and food good? How did the food there differ from Indian food in the USA?

Are you Indian? Do you have family there?"
32076,"Not the poster you replied to but I'm American and been to India lots of times to visit. The opulence in India is off the charts. There is very little middle ground: hotels and restaurants are typically either ridiculously fancy and expensive or they are completely basic and somewhat questionable. I stayed in a beach hut literally on the sand in Goa for less than $5USD/night and the Taj hotel in Hyderabad which was closer to $500. 
People are so nice and helpful all throughout the country. It's really easy as a foreigner to fuck up one of the local customs (e.g. walk into a shrine with shorts, ordering beer during a holy day) but locals laugh it off and help inform you in a polite way. 
Absolutely recommend visiting India especially the jungles of Kerala and the magical city of Varanasi."
32077,"Oberoi amarvillas in Agra, India... all the rooms overlook the Taj Mahal plus it’s super fancy"
32078,Charleston place in Charleston sc
32079,One of the best hotel pools ever and the best location.
32080,"Art Hotel in Barcelona. I was the hostess on a 2 day city trip some pharma sales people had won. I was so stressed I didn't fully enjoy it (these were high profile people of a very important client, I also adored them they were really good people and I wanted things to be perfect for them) but: the pool was amazing, the breakfast buffet was delicious, the bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. They have candies and chocolates all over the place for free.

One day, I will go back."
32081,"[Ololo Lodge](https://www.olololodge.com/) in Nairobi, Kenya. It's located right at the edge of the national park and it's *incredible*. From the airport, I was driven through the park itself and saw almost everything on my bucket list *before even arriving*. I stayed in one of their ""tents"" for a few days, started safari with my amazing guide every morning before sunrise (who is so knowledgeable, it's insane... he could see things hundreds of yards away I never would have been able to by myself). At one point, we got stuck in mud surrounded by a pride of lions, and he got us out like a champ. The lodge itself is eco-friendly, grows most of its own food (chefs are FANTASTIC), and is staffed by incredibly kind people. At night, you hear the sounds of the savanna, and you can even watch wild animals (giraffes, monkeys, etc) while eating outside. I absolutely cannot stress how amazing this place is, and I can't wait to go back.

I also stayed in [Giraffe Manor](https://www.thesafaricollection.com/properties/giraffe-manor/) right after Ololo Lodge. It's the hotel you always see on Facebook where the giraffes eat breakfast with you, etc. It was a different type of experience (much more laid back, no safari, etc.), but also tops my hotel list. Breakfast and afternoon tea with giraffes, plus it's located on AFEW grounds (African Fund for Endangered Wildlife). You have to REALLY love giraffes though, as everything is geared around them. It's the most expensive hotel I've stayed in at over $1200 USD/night for one of the smaller rooms and I only got in because of a cancellation; otherwise, the hotel is booked out over a year in advance -- but you're not just paying for the room, it's the entire experience they offer. I plan on going back in 2021, staying with all four hotels under their brand."
32082,"Hotel Chinzanso in Tokyo. It was my first 5 star hotel. The tub fit both me and my boyfriend comfortably and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The waiter at breakfast was hilarious and tried so hard to interact with us in English and even laughed at our jokes. I wish I could talk about the spa, but as a tattooed woman, I wasn't allowed in unless I wore a body suit or bandaged all my tattoos.... But I bet it was awesome..."
32083,Why weren’t you allowed in with tattoos?
32084,"Tattoos in Japan are usually a sign of the mafia Yakuza. It's pretty taboo in spas. Some are accepting of tattoos, but most make you cover up.

""This is because there is recognition in Japan from historical background that tattoo, so-called Irezumi in Japan, is “something anti-social people get” or “something members of illegal organization such as gangsters get.” ""

""I think that the main reasons why it changed into dirty image are because criminals got Irezumi as a sentence in the same Edo period, Irezumi was outlawed in the Meiji era and later, and gangster members have got Irezumi as a mean to show their power.

In this way, the image is very intensive in Japanese society that people with tattoo = members of anti-social forces, thus there is not a little possibility that customers tend to avoid the public bath if they see a person with tattoo there. ""

32085,That always blows my mind because foreign tourists with butterflies on their ankles are VERY CLEARLY NOT YAKUZA.

32087,Was this recent?
32088,Ritz Carleton club level in New Orleans.
32089,Wynn Las Vegas
32090,"Adrift in Long Beach Wa. It’s seriously nothing fancy, but it was just remodeled before we went and is super nice! We went in April and it was cheap. I guess it’s sort of fancy because you can’t take your bathroom soap or you get charged hahaha(some fancy organic specialty made soap) 

I’ve been to more expensive places, like hotels on Mackinac Island or on the water in Seattle that are $400 a night, but I like the Adrift better."
32091,"The Cove, Atlantis, The Bahamas. Not only was it really nice, it was completely FREE! My sister was a top five salesperson during a competition where she worked and I was her plus one for an all-expenses paid trip. Corporate jet and everything."
32092,I’m going there in a little over 2 weeks! Can’t wait!
32093,"The Ambassador in Milwaukee. We drove up on a snowy evening last year, to see a concert (Silverstein & Hawthorne Heights) - and ended up booking a hotel stay for one night because there was an awful blizzard assaulting the midwest, and we didn't want to have to drive home that night.

Turns out the Ambassador was the hotel where Jeffrey Dahmer's first murder took place. Legend has it, he cut up a boy's body, stuffed it in a duffel bag, and took it downstairs to the bar where he drank an old fashioned. So naturally, we had to have a drink down there and take all sorts of pictures to commemorate the fact that we were in such a landmark location ;)"
32094,Jealous you got to go to that show...
32095,The Haymarket Hotel in London. Just gorgeous.
32096,"A couple.  The Ritz on Maui was the most formally nice.  The coolest is an Air BNB in Wisconsin called,  Adeline’s House of Cool."
32097,"Burj Al Arab, Dubai, UAE. You’ve probably seen photos. It’s subtly shaped like a ship’s sail out in the water [(photo)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Al_Arab#/media/File%3ABurj_Al_Arab%2C_Dubai%2C_by_Joi_Ito_Dec2007.jpg)  and is said to be the only 7-star hotel in the world. Of course, I think they gave themselves that designation, but it doesn’t take away from the amazing 8-room suites. (Living room, kitchen, dining room, bar, 2 bedrooms, sitting area and these incredible bathrooms.) These are the smallest accommodations they have. It just gets bigger and more insane from there.
The food was similarly incredible. The hallways even were stunning, open all the way to the roof and designed in bright splashed of color, also found in the hand-tiled elaborate mosaics. Was seriously breathtaking."
32098,"omg, how did you afford it?"
32099,"Qasr Al Sarab in Abu Dhabi.

It's a 7 Star hotel that it's in the middle of nowhere in the desert. It's about a 3-hour drive from the main 'hub' of Abu Dhabi.

I've been fortunate to stay there twice now. The first time was with my ex-boyfriend, his birthday was in early February, his parents gave him some money for his birthday and because it was close to Valentine's Day they had offers on rooms.

The only word to describe it is oppulent. It just feels like going to a whole other world. Because it's so far from the city you can see the stars if you go out into the desert, and the breakfast was to DIE for. It just oozes luxury.

The second time I went was for work - we were shooting a video for Etihad Airways so we got to stay FOC, we watched a falcon show and Saluki racing. Because we were there in a 'work' capacity we got to speak to the staff and I was relieved to learn the people working with the animals were really passionate about them and cared for their well-being.

I was upset to see the Saluki dogs had muzzles on -- apparently, they didn't have them before but one of the dogs spotted a deer and went for the kill, horrifying the holiday-makers who were there and traumatising a young child."
32100,"AD here, can't wait to go when it cools down again. Everyone I've talked to has LOVED this place."
32101,Yeah deffo go during cooler months. It won't disappoint.
32102,"MONA museum of old and new art in Tasmania, Australia. 

First of all it’s the most incredible museum, after travelling in Europe and visiting many world renown museums I can confidently say that this place is miles ahead of the game. 
It also has a small number of architecturally designed standalone apartments on the grounds, each completely different from the next.
We arrived via the MONA Catamaran and were escorted to our apartment via golf cart, with a tour of the grounds on the way. Our apartment was the “Walter” and was a 2 story block, which basically looked liked a square had been tipped up on its edge (kind of hard to explain).
It featured the biggest beds I have ever seen, with what might as well be 10billion thread count sheets, a tv that came out of the roof via remote, a climate controlled wine fridge full of beautiful wine, stacks of art books and a view over the river. Not to mention an infinity pool, breakfast at the on site restaurant and early access to the museum the following morning.

This was the fanciest thing I have ever done."
32103,"Best hotel in terms of luxury? Either the Four Seasons in Vegas or the Savoy in London. 

However. The best hotel for experience? The Intercontinental Hotel in New York City. 

TL;DR When I went there for New Year's as a teenager I was incredibly sick. They got me an emergency appointment with a doctor, and the next day after calling up to check on me they gave me a free plate of about 15 warm and gooey chocolate chip cookies because they were happy I was feeling better. 

I went there with my mom when I was a teenager. Our flight got in late, so we had to check in late and they were absolutely fine with that. Thing is - I looked awful. And I felt awful too. Somehow my ever so slight cold had blown up into something much worse on the short flight from Toronto to New York. 

They noticed I looked ill, and the woman at the desk asked if I was alright. My mom just said I was tired (she didn't know). We got up to the room and I collapsed on the bed. I was freezing yet sweating buckets, and I felt like a sumo wrestler was sitting on my chest. 

The front desk called up and asked again if I was okay (I guess I really did look horrible). My mom told them I wasn't feeling well and asked if there was a walk-in clinic I could go to tomorrow. The hotel ended up making us an appointment to see a doctor the next day (but had asked if we wanted a ""house call""). 

I should mention that this was for New Year's, and the next day was New Year's Eve. Getting me an appointment with a doctor on New Years eve really was going the extra mile. 

So the next night, after I was full of meds (bad case of bronchitis), they called again to ask if I was feeling better. My mom told them I was and thanked then for what they did. 

Five minutes later there was a knock in our door. She opened it, and it was a hotel worker with a tray. She told him we didn't order any food, but he walked passed her and set it beside me on the bed. He lifted the dome and under it was a plate of about 15 chocolate chip cookies. They were still hot and gooey too. He said they were happy to hear I was feeling better, so they wanted to give me a free plate of cookies. 

No hotel has ever gone that far for me since, so because of that they'll always be my favourite."
32104,"The St.Regis in Bali, and The Upper House in Hong Kong."
32105,"lol ok hear me out

The Marriott in Baltimore. The one right on the water. 

I grew up...well, we weren't quite poor, but we were one overdraft fee away from screwed thanks to my mom's credit card issues, so this is bar far the nicest hotel I've ever seen. 

It was so cool - room service is real! So are bellhops and wine in the attached restaurant and weddings walked by on their way to ballrooms and there were double digit floors numbers starting with a three!

It basically blew my mind. My husband still likes to think about it jut because it was so, so new to me and my reactions were apparently priceless lol"
32106,"Not a woman, but I have to chime in on this one...

Back when I was a kid, my family used to stay in Atlantic City a lot. My grandparents were pretty regular gamblers, and so they always got the invitations to come back ""for free"" and obviously spend more money ha. One of their favorites was Caesar's.

But one time, we were running many hours late and told them about it on the way. ""Sure, no problem, we'll hold your room!""

So we get there, and they had given it away. With absolutely zero normal rooms, or even suites left to give us, they only had *one* option. The emperor's suite. Holy crap, it was awesome... There was a small gym, a big fancy glass table, less of a dining table and more of a ""small conference table"", two (or three?) large rooms. The damn thing was practically a luxury apartment on its own!

And all because they mistakenly gave our regular room away! It was epic.

I actually just looked up some videos of it on YouTube, and I'm not sure how many of them they have. I distinctly remember the layout being different than in the videos, and the whole suite much larger. Maybe I was just a lot smaller? :)"
32107,"The [Tickle Pink Inn in Carmel Highlands](https://www.ticklepinkinn.com/).  

We stayed in the [Senator's Cottage](https://www.ticklepinkinn.com/senators-cottage-34.htm).  It had a tree growing up through the living room.  

Perched up overlooking the Big Sur coastline, the view was breathtaking."
32108,Waldorf Astoria in Versailles. It’s a little old but absolutely gorgeous. Right next to the palace. The breakfast buffet is to die for. If I could live there I would.
32109,"The Fontainebleau Miami. The restaurants are to die for (Scarpetta for an upscale option, Pizza & Burger for something casual...best pizza ever). The outdoor area has pools, cabanas, a walk up to a private beach with drink service, tons of beautiful plants, bars, etc. It is amazing! The hotel’s best kept secret is a pool on the 7th floor–its always chill, more relaxed and has pretty views. It’s open to guests but not mentioned on the website. I didn’t get to the nightclub but there were huge lines for it and notable DJs playing. The entire resort has a very lux feel to it, there is so much attention to detail and beautiful architecture throughout the lobby and other common areas. You could easily stay there for a week and never leave the resort, there is everything you could need and more. It has the feel of a nice all inclusive resort. And not to mention, the staff was truly incredible! So many kind, professional, accommodating people whether it was the front desk, poolside, or at the restaurants."
32110,"They have an indoor pool???  It was raining when we were there, I would have loved their pool. The spa has a rain room where it rains warm rain that starts out slow and eventually becomes torrential. 
Did you see the Grandmother Clock?
https://youtu.be/YUVWrGTDdHo"
32111,"It’s actually not indoor, it’s outside on a rooftop type of setting! But omg that spa sounds incredible. I am a sucker for rainy weather and storms so that rain room is on my list if I ever go back! I didn’t see that clock either but it is amazing 😂"
32112,"I only get to go to places like this because of my husband getting rewarded for achievements at his tech job. If I could go back, I would... but only for the rain room. I also love rain and storms. 
The Midwest and plains states have had rain every day for the last 12 days. Many of them have been stormy. Bring me overcast over sun ☀️"
32113,"My top 3:

1. Park Hyatt, Sydney: this is my favourite hotel (and in my own city.) The level of service is exceptional. The Australian hospitality industry leaves a lot to be desired in general, but the Park Hyatt gets almost everything right. Plus, almost every room has a view of the Opera House. Every time I check in here, I feel like my blood pressure drops by half.
2. Aman, Tokyo: absolute bliss. The staff are incredible and the hotel itself is a work of art.
3. Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat: Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is one of my favourite places to visit. Like everyone else on the planet, I wish I owned a house there, but staying at the Grand-Hotel is a nice compromise! The hotel itself is huge, but somehow still feels intimate. My favourite thing to do is swim in the *crique de la Causinière* ocean pool attached to the hotel. It's always quiet, unlike other similar places on the French riviera  (like Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, etc)"
32114,"Disney’s Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida. It’s so fancy and the monorail passes through it (no, it’s not loud). You also get a view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks! There are fun pools and restaurants and gift shops and spas and honestly you could spend a whole day there just exploring!"
32115,We were just there in February! It was wonderful.
32116,That was my dream hotel when I was little.
32117,The fanciest hotel I've ever been at is the Hilton suites and its because I work there 😩 can't wait to travel and see what all these hotels people are coming are about!
32118,CitizenM hotel in Amsterdam (though they have them in a bunch of other cities). The hotel is designed to be super functionally minimalistic in that they get rid of everything guests probably won’t use/need and make everything they would use/need exponentially better & cooler.
32119,"We stayed at a CitizenM in Paris a couple of years ago! It was fun, and they had an awesome cocktail lounge on the top floor where you could see the Eiffel Tower."
32120,"Fiordland Lodge in Te’Aneau, New Zealand.   I could write a wall of text about how awesome it was.  Look it up and go if you’re planning on a NZ trip. 

Also, The Sacher Hotel in Salzburg, Germany."
32121,"It was actually a tiny Air B&B in Yachats OR, I highly recommend. There is nothing like being right on the ocean and living for a few days with access to a firepit, a little grocery store, and a million quiet, touristy shops. Plus, the best coffee shop I've ever been to right down the street. I desperately want to go back someday!"
32122,"This is such a tough question because hotels can be qualified so differently. Service vs food vs atmosphere etc. The most luxurious was the [Palace Old Town](https://images.app.goo.gl/aB941gU2ScaRVPRS6) at the foot of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Insanely nice place with unbelievable service. The most enjoyable was [Sala Phuket](https://images.app.goo.gl/Pu58Qaswd3uyzEJk7) in Thailand. I don’t even like the beach, but I still have dreams about the resort and the private pool suite."
32123,"Bakuba eco-hotel in Toliara, on the west coast of Madagascar. 

Eco hotel off the beaten track on a remote beach near local fishing villages. You could walk down from the hotel to the sea and completely pure white sand beaches. 

Designed by a french architect and his wife with gorgeous uniquely themed rooms using African furniture and textiles. The whole building was sculpted like a rock garden/the Flintstones, and ran off renewable power. There were only three guest rooms. The patio looked out onto the strait of Mozambique and I watched the sunset over the ocean from the pool on the deck. Also, French-trained chef. Also, spa and massage tower."
32124,"The Mandarin Oriental in Malaysia. Everything is so fancy, the rooms are gorgeous, they have a lovely spa and outdoor infinity pool. The staff are all super professional and tidy the rooms immaculately. The best thing was the food though, they had a huge buffet breakfast every morning. I'm used to a buffet table but this was a buffet room!"
32125,"Nayara Spring in Costa Rica. Individual huts in the middle of the jungle with views of a volcano. And an outdoor shower. This changed my life
 No shower will ever compare."
32126,Cant remember the hotel name but it was in Osaka japan. it was so nice the beds where very comfy and right a cross the street there was a 7/11 and Mosbuger so if i got hungry at night i would just walk down stares and get some food now lets talk about the bath room now when i went to japan it was winter there so the bath room floor so heated that right heated floor man it was so nice and the toilet seat was heated the toilet was really nice it let me play any song i wanted on the toilet man that was nice and the bath there was nice and big with a huge shower there as well
32127,"The Cullen Hotel in Melbourne Australia.

Nothing fancy, and actually really affordable, just a really pretty artsy hotel with the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in to this day. They even sell their mattresses, I was tempted. Still am. Stayed there for a work conference for a few days."
32128,"i mean probably The Altanis Hotel in Dubai..
they even got rooms with an Aquarium as a wall.
i mean u could watch fishes having sex while u fall asleep.. that the best thing i can imagine.

ps. 4 real this reeaaally great!"

32134,The Royal in Cancun
32135,"Wasn’t a hotel. My family rented a beach house for a week for Spring Breaks. They usually were a block from the Destin Florida beach and had a pool. Great memories.

One year we stayed at my Aunt and Uncle’s company rental  in Panama Beach (Uncle had a hand in a massive business on his side of the family, and let us stay at this humongous house on a country club. Oh yeah it had a dock and a small boat too)
They even let us use their private jet + crew! 

Otherwise there was a nice place in Nashville that had THE BEST shower and breakfast. It was great because my sisters, mom, and I had been out all night for New Year’s."
32136,"Sprowston Manor in Norwich, England. My husband and I were living abroad for two years and he surprised me with a mini-getaway there for my 23rd birthday. 

The food, the spa, the room.... it was such an amazing experience."
32137,"Hotel Sant Francesc in Mallorca. It used to be the mansion of a rich Spanish family, and it was converted into a hotel. 

Everything was minimalist yet decadent and beautiful. We got upgraded to a suite, and honestly I still dream about it."
32139,"I used to live next door to the space that is now the Hyde. It’s fairly new, and I’m glad I moved because it blocked my apartment’s ocean view. The restaurant at the Hyde has a lovely charcuterie board, but the parking is a nightmare. If you’re ever in South Florida again, message me, and I’ll give you a list of hotels you’ll love."
32140,I’ll def remember that!
32141,"I stayed at a beautiful mountain resort north of Guilin in China. We were on the river and it was so beautiful. We got massages and had beers and peanuts on the patio, and it was the most beautiful place I’ve ever visited."
32142,How did you like China? Did you visit any other part of it?
32143,Skyrise apartment turned Airbnb. It's not a hotel technically but I'm counting it. 87 floors up and we could see all of West Kowloon up there.
32144,"The Peninsula, Hong Kong  may not be the best but most certainly it’s the most elegant."
32145,I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York several years ago.  That was pretty nice.
32146,"My dad is an accountant and when I was younger he had a client who lived in LA but owned  some time shares in Whistler, BC and never used them. We are from Vancouver and because my dad was really the only person he knew here he would let use these places when it was his turn. The nicest place we stayed was a house that at the time was worth over $3 million. It was incredible. The floors were heated and I remember not even knowing that was a thing. For years after that place was my motivation to do well in school because I wanted to be able to afford a place like it one day.  My dad started working for another firm  shortly after so unfortunately he doesn't get those perks anymore."
32147,"The Marriott in Chepstow, Wales, was pretty cool. It's more of a golf resort built around a castle. I enjoyed it there!"
32148,"Germany, a tiny YHA just off the autobahn. We were doing a lot of driving that day and just pick the closest one, it was a beautiful wooden cottage with a little old lady running the place, we gave them about 40 minutes warning at 8-9 at night, we took up to get but it was amazing. In the morning I was the most fantastic breakfast we had ever had in Germany so far. We forgot to circle it in the book and never found it again despite looking over and over again when we were doing the same route (airport to where my brother was living for 9 years)"
32149,"Ayana Resort in Bali! We usually stay at smaller and cheaper accommodations for holidays, but that time my Dad allowed us to splurge a bit. Money well spent!"
32150,"I can’t choose but probably Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. My partner and I went back to Singapore just for the hotel. The pool really lives up to the photos.

Other places I really enjoyed were the Grand Hyatt in Dubai, Mira Moon in Hong Kong and The Sofitel in Vienna."
32151,"I've stayed in Pennyhill Park in Surrey, Essex twice and it's the nicest and most luxurious hotel I've experienced. It's more like a spa/country club but it's very traditional British, every room has completely different decor and is named after a type of tree, which I find adorable. The first time I stayed there I was gobsmacked by the size of my room and the four poster bed and the bathroom. The second time I stayed there I was in a completely different room which seemed smaller until I noticed the STAIRCASE up to the second floor of my room hosting just a bath with a built-in television and a round sofa. Bear in mind I was staying in this room alone. 

In the morning I looked out of my window and there were deer grazing on the grounds. For someone who is not used to anything like this I was in awe of the whole place."
32152,"Cabin right on Lake Superior in the Upper Peninsula. The owner was a very sweet lady and the views are simply devine!

Petoskey stone drawer pulls did me in :)

12/10 would recommend!

32153,"The Hilton in Chicago.  It was lovely, the staff was considerate, professional and accommodating.  It may very well be a small thing but for the first time in my life I sent out dry cleaning. I received the item back first thing the next morning and I felt extremely spoiled.  I might be confusing two hotels but I think they gave us cookies at the front desk also. I was traveling a great deal between Dallas, Chicago and New York at the time so I may have the cookies confused.  Either way I felt like a queen."
32154,"It was a hostel in India. It is called Dreams Hostel in Goa India, check it out if you're in that area! The owner is amazing and I made so many friends in that place."
32155,"The two best hotels I've ever stayed at:

1. Abbeyglen Castle Hotel in Connemara, Ireland. 

I was traveling by myself and found a great deal for $67/night in the off-season. The room was beautiful, common areas were cozy, owner was super welcoming, and the breakfast and afternoon tea were among the best I've had. It's not a ""luxury"" castle, but rather a warm, comfortable one. 

2. The Beach Club at Walt Disney World. 

I wish I could stay here every time I go to Disney! What makes this hotel amazing is the location; it's  on the Boardwalk, and it's walking distance to Epcot. Watching Illuminations and then strolling around the moonlit lake back to your room is the best feeling ever. It also has an incredible pool, and the rooms are really nice. I can't wait until I can afford to stay here again."
32156,"It's a toss up between the Villa Dubrovnik and the Hoshinoya Karuizawa.

The Villa Dubrovnik sits on the cliffs overlooking the city of Dubrovnik and you can see the harbour and walls of the old city from the hotel. The service is top notch, the infinity pool is lovely, there's a private cliffside area to swim from, and there is a boat shuttle that will run you into the city and back so you can visit it anytime you choose. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are on the terrace where you have a view of the Old Town and Lokrum Island.  We had some of the best meals of our trip there. Favourite memory: sitting on the terrace in the morning having croissants slathered in jam, a cup of really good coffee, surrounded by the smell of the cedars, and seeing the sparkling water and the walls of Dubrovnik just across the bay. sigh.

The Hoshinoya Karuizawa is a mountainside ryokan (hot spring resort) an hour and a half out of Tokyo, and it's magical. The whole resort is surrounded by forest, mountain and water, and there are waterfalls throughout so you are never far from the sound of running water. Chalets with floor to ceiling windows, each with its own private deck, sit alongside the river, and every evening a boat comes to light lanterns that float on the water. It has two hot spring baths - there's the Meditation Bath where an enclosed hot pool leads through a tunnel into the quiet room, a room lit only by a single green light under the water, and the Tombo-no-yu baths, the open air hot spring baths with mountain views. Nearby there are woodland trails, a bird sanctuary and an ice rink for winter skating. again, sigh."
32157,"Depressingly, that was the Cinnamon Grand in Sri Lanka for a work trip in February. It was blown up in the Easter terrorist attacks :(."
32158,Hyatt hotel in Paris. Their coffee was so. Fucking. Good.
32159,Upvoting for excellent coffee recommendation.
32160,"I'm making notes of all of these for future travel.

A girl can dream."
32161,The cosmopolitan in Vegas! I always loved that hotel but what made it better is my husband upgraded it to where we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain from our balcony and a Japanese jacuzzi tub as well. Definitely was hard to even leave the room.
32162,"The Culver Hotel! It’s where a ton of golden age Hollywood stars stayed during filming, and it’s full of history, mystique and ghost stories (supposedly one of the Dwarfs from Wizard of Oz died there). The rooms are gorgeous, there’s live jazz in the dining area and don’t even get me started on the food and drinks. Love this place so much we stayed there when we got married!"
32163,I'd say my best hotel experience was at the Hilton on the gold coast in Australia. My friends and I decided to go all out and go 5 star for a holiday the year out of school. Our amazing stay started off rocky though and what really made it great was their problem solving.  We booked our holiday the week after schoolies and when we got there the schoolies had damaged the room and stretched a used condom over the smoke detector. We called the reception and let them know. Asking if they can give us a different room. The manager himself came to our rescue and was very apologetic. We got VIP treatment and a room upgrade. From a normal room straight up to the top floor penthouse at no extra charge. We got all the extras you get when you actually pay for that room. Essentially got 6 days free since we didn't get charged for the difference so that was the best hotel experience ever for a bunch of 18yr old.
32164,"Best and not so good at the same time. 

The Livingstone hotel in Zambia. 

Awesome high tea, cocktail lounge next to Victoria Falls with day beds you can just fall asleep in. 

Luxurious rooms that you need to keep doors closed to prevent monkeys coming in and butler service. Zebras grazing through the grounds.

Not so good because the minute you walk out and see the poverty the average citizens are dealing with makes you really not want to stay there out of guilt. Also, butler service makes me uncomfortable. I also don't like how it's really keeping the colonial design, feel and service. It just.....doesn't sit well with me. 

So maybe, the actual best hotel is Nottens at Kruger National park. 

It's a small Safari Camp with awesome food, unlimited bar tab and great guides taking you out everyday to spot animals. Just make sure you don't get drunk there and forget to lock the door. A staff of theirs got eaten by hyenas because of that.

And maybe another one is Matsunoyama Tamakiya onsen hotel. Honestly, the best organic kaiseki meal I've ever had coupled with Niigata sake, private onsen bath with snow falling around you. The only downside is it's a hassle to get there.

Finally, my other favourite one would be Pangkor Laut resort and Seven Terraces in Penang. Pangkor Laut because you get to experience those cabins on stilts in the middle of the sea for a fraction of the price with great Malaysian food. Seven Terraces for the old time charm, afternoon tea and kuehs and great service."
32165,"About 7 or 8 years ago, I was dating a guy who had formerly been the general manager at an upscale boutique hotel in Rome that was converted from a gorgeous neoclassical bank. We traveled to Rome on holiday and stayed in the hotel where my boyfriend was ""Papà!"", he had hired literally everyone who worked at the hotel, we were treated like family. It was amazing."
32166,"Ritz Carlton. My dad had been booked in one of their rooms by his new company for a training seminar when I was a kid. Our family went on the trip and we pulled in about 11pm after driving for hours.  The concierge checked the computer, blanched and started apologizing profusely, saying our room had been double booked and the other people were already there.  He went away for a few minutes, then the manager came back and said ""we only have one room left tonight, if you'll come with me I will show it to you and you may have it for free if you approve.""  

We figured it was gonna be a broom closet in the basement, and would've been happy to take it, but instead the elevator went up and up and when we reached the top floor, he led us all the way down the hall.  When we got to the end, we saw two gorgeous wooden and brass doors.  I remember my parents looking at each other with big eyes, but just then he opened the doors and flipped the lights, and we gazed upon a Steinway concert grand parked under a crystal chandelier, in the living room of the Presidential Penthouse Suite.  There was also a dining room, breakfast room, full kitchen, separate bedroom and two bathrooms. The only downside was the very faint whiff of fresh paint, since Motley Crue had stayed there the previous week (this was the 80s, in their guitar-smashing heyday.)

&#x200B;

The service was really impeccable though, 10/10 would stay again if I could afford it.  They treated us ragamuffins from the sticks like we were royalty. Also, I loved playing the piano so it was super-fun to attack my practice sessions on a) a baroque-style Steinway and b) the same piano Elton John and a bunch of others had played on."

32168,I forget the name of it but it was a hotel (timeshare?) in Hawaii. My uncle oversaw some construction happening there so he got some discount.  I was a teenager at the time there wasn't really anything for me but I remember it being a really nice room and place in general.

32182,"When i was in Ireland i stayed in this place called the Killarney Guest House. Super cute place. They were situated like houses but had an area where you could eat breakfast.. you also had your own private room, with a private bathroom. The breakfast was so good, a full breakfast, and the people that ran it were super nice. Our beds were always made, the rooms were clean.

The location was great too. Right across from Cork college and about a mile walk from the town where there were tons of bars and shopping.

It was a nice place to stay that wasnt exactly a “hotel” type place

Only downfall was no elevators and we had to climb three flights of stairs with our luggage"

As a shakespeare nerd I had a lot of fun staying someplace that felt so exclusive and having access to the tiny courtyard after hours. Even though Juliet's house is so touristy and it was kind of annoying having to fight the tourists, it was a cute place. 

The rooms themselves were phenomenal. My boyfriend and I could each lay out on the bed and starfish without touching each other. I've never slept in such a nice bed in my life. Then there were the jacuzzi tubs, the smart system set up in the rooms, the excellent in room breakfast.

32197,Hotel Des Indes The Hague! A-maz-ing!
32198,"A friend of mine works for a small luxurious hotel in London.  
He told me the  concerge system there is absolutely absurd. Money buys everything.

Anything the clients want, clients get. They are told never to say no, worst case they say ""I don't think this is really appropriate""

Obviously drugs and escorts are a classic. He showed me 20 phone numbers of drug dealers in his phone to be able to get whatever drugs to the customers (he never buys  though, only gets people in contact).

And for harder tasks, he goes through professional concierges who charge A LOT.

\- You want a new Prada dress at 2AM for the party you are about to  attend? Sure thing, let's wake a few people up, charge triple the price and split the benefit between people involved. Have a good night madam.

\- You want tickets for the Wimbledon final that takes place tomorrow? You have £20k? Enjoy the game, sir.

But in some cases, they can't satisfy the customer. So when a couple of clients came back drunk asking him to have sex with the wife while the husband was watching and filming, he felt like it was a good time to say     ""I don't think this is really appropriate""."
32199,That sentence also sounds much better with a British accent.
32200,"My husband worked at several luxury hotels and residences (rich people who live at the hotels) and besides how absolutely disgusting everything inside the rooms actually is...I was most shocked by the behavior of the ultra rich. 

I’m not talking businessmen and doctors. I’m talking Saudi Princes and Heirs to Dynasty families. The level of comfort and technology these people have come to expect is things we cannot imagine. 

“What do you mean there isn’t there access to intercoms next to the bathroom for when I need services while going potty?” “The television inside the shower is only a 40 inch and there is no gold in this room I need a better suite”. “I’m gonna need you to go out, buy me better bedding, remake my bed, and then do it again tomorrow because I won’t sleep on the same bedding twice”.

32202,I want more stories of the ultra rich
32203,"Used to work in one two summers ago in a remote-ish place where we lived in accommodations across the street from the hotel. A lot of us have slept with each other (not me, had a gf at the time). And the busiest days are weekends, so we usually have Mondays off. Sundays were called Sunday Funday, where we would go to town or other people's ""dorms"", and do way too much coke."
32204,"I spent 10 years in the boutique and 5 star hotel world. Got stories for days. But here is my favorite that sums up hospitality (former anyways).

Our concierge was Les Clefs D'or, had all the connections, this dude could get you into the French Laundry same day. He would often greet guests with sangria and sprigs of mint from his garden. Sometimes he had lemon slices from his tree too! He loved to tell guests all about his garden and they ate it up. 

Yeah that's all bullshit. Mint, lemon, and any other garnish we got from the local grocery store. The sangria? Cheapest boxed stuff we could find. But he sold the story like no other. At the end of the day, it worked."
32205,"I'm convinced most people don't know the difference between good and shitty liquor. I did wine sampling at stores and people would enjoy a wine until you told them it was $6. Or the opposite, it was gross until they found out it was $30"
32206,"Honestly same. I would often send people to smaller ""mom and pop"" vineyards, but it had to be sold as this boutique-y experience. If you told someone ""So there's this little farm down the road that sells some great wine, you literally just drive up and meet the farmer/owners since they don't do reservations"", they wouldn't go. But if you said ""I personally know the so-and-so's, they have this micro-vineyard tucked away from the main road where they make some of the BEST pinot in the insertnamehere valley, I highly recommend it. They are so small they don't even take reservations, otherwise they would book up and I'd never be able to get you in!"" the guests would coo and bolt for it. 

Best wine I've had has been cheapo stuff, and I've tasted a looooot of wine back in my hotelier days."
32207,"Corporate intern events where the kids would get plied with alcohol. Infuriating. We had one company annually bring 80 interns as part of a site visit tour, and it was a nightmare.

I was sure someone would die every year. One year there were three hospitalizations though, and one of the boys sent the hospital bill to the hotel. To be clear, the entire F&B team knew about the event and were very vigilant about refusing service. We were not involved or liable in his medical issue. The audacity.

Particularly because he and all of his intern colleagues trashed everything. We had to prepare the lobby by removing sculptures and porcelain plant pots. One year we started always removing a kind of sharp-cornered bookcase because too many drunk interns had hurt themselves on it. There were bodily fluids everywhere and linens destroyed beyond continued use. Plumbing broke daily. There was always smoking damage in some rooms. 

But all the adults were useless, of course. And all adults were culpable in providing alcohol to the underage people. The company accepted the bill for the damage every year, and always came back. And we would add literally everything we could. We would tack weeks worth of room nights onto their bill because we had to keep dozens of rooms out of service while damage was repaired. The company paid for everything we comped for complaining guests too. They also paid for anything we had to replace, and they were so used to the damage fees we would just throw things in there sometimes. Like a treadmill finally broke during their residence. But did one of their guests break it? Don't know, didn't care, they bought us a new treadmill.

We were one of three hotels on this annual tour."
32208,"Omg another internship story. Different company would send us groups of students and trainees a few times a year. If their founder was in town too he would always try to get keys to one of the girl's rooms. Because ""they're really my rooms"". No, sir. Absolutely not. He tried every time. We would have to staff additional night audit to be stationed on the group floor all night because the GM was afraid somebody would eventually be worn down or scared into complying. Or worse, totally okay with it and not seeing the problem at all.

Don't go on trips for your internships my guys."
32209,This is scary shit. I once attended a youth conference which involved staying at a hotel for a week and the organizers were so stringent about this that they had special security placed on the girls’ floors right in front of the elevator doors and stairs so that no guy could sneak there
32210,"Here's one taken from the opposite end. I'm really bad at rolling joints. I left the shitty joint with my stash and papers on the dresser. I come back to a nicely rolled joint. I don't know if any was missing .

But thank you Hard Rock LV staff."
32211,"Ha, a ""joint effort""."
32212,I’m reading these while laying in a hotel bed and I don’t like this.
32213,"I have worked at two.  Hotels that are rated by Forbes (formerly Mobil) and randomly “inspected” frequently, and there is a very specific checklist of things the hotel/restaurants must do/offer in order to keep their rating.  We always had to be suspicious of any single diners because they could possibly be inspectors.  So you could be a regular Joe Schmoe but if you are dining alone you are going to get the 5 star treatment.  Once we had a particular woman staying at the hotel and somehow management figured out and confirmed she was an inspector.  They literally took security cam stills and printed them out to give to all employees so we would know who she was.  I still remember her name was Katrina 😂


Something else interesting - one of the (5 star) restaurants I worked at (in a 5 star hotel) would frequently be closed for private events. There was usually a contract written beforehand stating the group must spend a minimum amount of money.  We got automatic gratuity on whatever that minimum was but the goal was to go over so we would make more money.  The people at the events usually didn’t know these details (they weren’t the ones paying) and towards the end of the night if they hadn’t reached the minimum we would have to start pouring the most expensive wine and liquors to meet the goal.  Who wants a few rounds of McAllen 25 doubles etc.  And people still tipped cash on the open bars so it was easy to walk away with $500 a night in tips after those parties.  It was the easiest money I ever made.


ETA - MACALLAN!  Ha, please forgive me I am a lowly tequila drinker"
32214,"If I've ever go to one of those hotels, I'll act suspicious then. Thanks for the tip."
32215,"I worked at one of the premier hotels at a ski resort in the country; top 10. Met celebrities, royalty, politicians, athletes. 

Hockey players are the nicest athletes by a wide margin. Royalty is great or more likely, awful. A list celebrities want to be left alone or treated as just another person. Politicians are bigger assholes when they’re with their families. Saw lots of sex, drugs, underaged drinking, escorts, the usual. 

I was most amazed by how nice staff were to guests when management continually made our lives harder and shittier. We’d just let it roll off our backs and keep smiling until we just quit. We were paid so little and respected so little by management. If you weren’t thick skinned then you quit by week’s end. 

Best thing I saw was the hotel dog (think alpine dog that people can pet, kids can get woken up by him in the morning, plays on the ski slopes, etc)...well he escaped his pen, made straight for the high end restaurant and went hog wild. Jumped on a few tables and scarfed $100 steaks like they were M&Ms. Me and another guy saw it (we worked during the ski day and cleaned up into the evening so it was just him and I finishing up in our department at the time which was by the dog’s kennel)...we both saw he was going to escape and we could have stopped it but we just wanted to watch the world burn. Greatest day of work there by far."
32216,"Best story on this thread- doesn’t involve jizz, poop, murder or suicide.

32217,Probably for the hotel dog as well!
32218,"I worked at a Ritz Carlton a few years back, its literally the same as anywhere else. The hotel staff is amazing at their job, but on their personal time they're just as fucked as everyone else. 

The kitchen staff had a few folks with drug issues and had to be sent home a couple times because of it. In my time there I saw 2 waiters get fired due to embezzlement. The turnover rate for management was very high because they didn't pay enough for the area. The staff parties were WILD to say the least.

We weren't allowed to greet celebrities by name since they wanted to be anonymous, so we would use their alias that day. Some were greeted by prostitutes or ""escorts"" who were always super nice to everyone. A regular would rent out a room for a day, once a month, and make 30-40k that day from clients. Celebrities, business guys, you name it. Crazy."
32219,"I’ve always wanted to know: how does a celebrity’s alias for a booking get advised to the hotel?  Does their assistant or whoever makes the reservation say that the booking is for JeffMegaStar (or whatever the celeb’s name is), but they will be travelling under “Phil McCracken” or whatever?

And how does the person doing the check-in know that the person standing in front of them (who they may or may not recognise) is going to be under “McCracken”?"
32220,"I once worked for a hotel booking sort of call centre company. We had Shaq book the Ritz for himself once, under his own name. AJ Mclean booked once under his name, and I also personally booked Andrea Martin and Bonnie Hunt on separate occasions, both under their own names.

The Shaq call was hilarious, we all listened to the recording.

""OK, can I get a first name for the booking?""

""Shaquille.""

""Oh, you're in good company! And the last name?""

""O'Neal.""

""OK Mr. O-... Sh... Shaq?"""
32221,"Lol, the way they ask “Shaq?” makes me imagine that Shaq’s an old buddy of theirs and they just realized they were talking to their homie, in a “Sh... Shaq? That you, man?” kinda way."
32222,"I've worked with a few celebrities and athletes in the past, in a different capacity than hospitality. The ones I worked with *always* used fake names, plus their room was actually reserved and paid for by their assistants so their name never showed on paperwork. However, since they were listed as staying in the room, their name was added to the card, and that's where the fake name comes in.

One guy, the late author Tom Clancy, always used the name of his lead character, Jack Ryan when getting a room."
32224,So that's why I got the free upgrade at Motel 6 when I checked in as Jack Ryan.
32225,TIL Motel 6 has upgrades
32226,"NEVER EVER EVER (I REPEAT!!) USE A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN FROM A HOTEL OR BANQUET HALL!!!

Picture this: it’s an expensive ass Sunday brunch. Well little Timmy just double fisted strawberries directly into that chocolate, bit into both strawberries then triple dipped into the chocolate AGAIN! And some old rich lady just sneezed on it. And somebody else just dropped their snack into it. The best part: that chocolate gets strained and saved for the next weeks brunch. Chocolate is waaay too expensive to throw away.

Chocolate also does this thing where it’ll seize if it has the wrong moisture content (from people dipping fruit, and the juices going into the chocolate.) So it’ll get so thick it won’t run through the machine. Wanna know how they fix that? They add canola oil until it’s smooth again.

So, yeah, next time you’re at a wedding and they have a chocolate fountain, think of this post. Think of this post when you dip into that dirty ass watered down with oil chocolate.

Edit: word

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the awards and upvotes! I’m glad I was able to save atleast 3.2K of you lol"
32227,"I think the oil is needed in general to make a chocolate fountain run smoothly, but rest of that is gross lol."
32228,Bedbugs. Every single hotel from run down motels to 5-star resorts has dealt with bedbugs.
32229,And I've never seen one. How do they deal with them so quickly and effectively?
32230,"Massively exterminate them by cleaning the entire room.

Hotels have a protocol for dealing with a bedbug infestation because it can destroy the hotel/corp reputation and even bankrupt the company. Bad news travels fast. So if it gets out it's incredibly bad for years. 

So they go scorched Earth on the room. Steam cleaning, massive chemical cleaning, bagging everything up etc. Cleaning companies come in etc. 

They take it as serious as anything else bad that can happen. It's a terrible issue PR-wise."
32231,"My SO worked for a fancy hotel. The building owners (not the chain, the actual building itself) came to visit. He was on the Forbes billionaire list. 

He was a nice man who had buffet lunches everyday and tipped every staff members he saw a crisp $100, every time he saw them. 

House keeper walking past? $100. Bar tender setting up? $100 

Shift swap? 100 on the way in and out."
32232,This is how you billionaire
32233,"Seriously. It means little to nothing to him, will *at the very least* make someone else's day and probably make him the favorite guest of all time to the staff.

- Husbands who will say hello to staff with their mistress on their arm on Thursday night and their wife on Friday night
- Famous teen celebrity left a room full of needles and various drug paraphernalia behind for housekeeping to clean up
- Middle eastern royalty ships in multiple Ferraris and Lamborghinis to the hotel from their home country to drive for the week; caught drag racing later that night by the cops in the neighborhoods of Beverly Hills
- Largest checkout bill I’ve ever seen was roughly $2 million for guest who rented out an entire floor of suites for three weeks, promptly paid via wire transfer
- Had to procure $100k cash for a guest whose wife wanted to shop on Rodeo Drive the next morning, the local bank doesn’t even have that much. Had to get an armored car from the central LA bank branch to deliver

The list goes on.."
32235,Are credit cards not a thing in the last one?
32236,Think of the Southwest points they’re missing out on!!
32237,How exactly do you just get an armored car to come make a delivery? That seems like a lot of money to just be picking up and driving around impromptu. Or do you send the bill for the truck to the client who wanted the money?
32238,A lot of lonely people going on vacation to end their life. Happens a lot but is never mentioned on the news.
32239,"I've left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door all day because I wanted a quiet day alone, and around 4PM housekeeping plus a manager came and knocked to do a welfare check for this exact reason. 

Note that I've spent a lot of time in hotels and have only had that happen once, but it makes sense I guess."
32240,"Ohhhh......I'm very private and travel alone. My first thing is to stick the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up. I was in and out (B-and-B) would have breakfast, talk with the staff and other guests, hit my festival, etc.

I was SUPER annoyed when I came back the fourth day to my room being cleaned and the sign ignored. It never occurred to me that maybe they were just ""checking up""."
32241,In most states there is an actual law for this. Theyre REQUIRED to check after the 3rd day almost always.
32243,"Chinese guy in the apartment across from me was cooking some fish dish that smelled so strong someone reported a body. I came home just as the police were taking position on either side of the door. They thought it smelled like a body, too, and could hear someone moving around in there, lol."
32244,"Wife and I used to have a noisy neighbour, and then all of a sudden the loud music and noise in the evenings stopped.  A few days later every time we went in the hall we joked that it ""smelled like death in here"".

A few days after that we come home and find our landlord hauling stuff out and asked him what happened.

""He died."""
32245,"Well, at least he died with the music off."
32246,"I’ve honestly never thought of this, but it makes total sense."
32247,Yup. The worst is you being the last person they talk to. They don’t confess about taking their life only complain about family not supporting them for whatever reason. Londoners are the highest risk in the hotel my friend works at. Some companies hold events for their workers and don’t allow them to get rooms beyond the 3rd floor.
32248,"I live near Niagara Falls NY and unfortunately this is a true fact. Before the modern era it was a really popular spot for travelers to take their lives and the only evidence that it happened were abandoned cars (and carriages as it was a really popular suicide site in the late 1800s)

It's a horrible way to go (you drown at the Horseshoe Falls or you get bashed against rocks at the American Falls) and an unknown but likely large percentage of bodies are never recovered.  Back in pre- Border Patrol days people used to jump off the Rainbow Bridge that connects the US & Canada and either die from the impact with the Niagara River or were swept into the Rapids and Whirlpool to drown. 

It's always sad to hear of someone going missing because of the possibility of suicide and just a couple weeks ago it happened with a young college student from NYC who did it over a breakup. They only know it happened because the police dogs traced her right to the waters edge. I only wish someone had seen her and could have persuaded her not to do it, especially when she had so much life left to live and no relationship is worth dying over."
