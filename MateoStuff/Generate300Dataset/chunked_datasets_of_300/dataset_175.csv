57540,Yup! Tygar is it! Women just love the scent though I’ve gotten compliments from gay men too. lol
57541,"Wow. Now it's making me contemplate on what I should get for my next fragrance in my line-up. Was thinking of getting Creed Aventus, which will be my biggest buy for a fragrance. But now I'm giving Tygar a consideration."
57542,If you can try to get a sample but I highly recommend it. It’s a feel good fragrance definitely that’s why I think it’s such a compliment getter.
57543,"Just curious how many sprays you usually wear? I sprayed it on my forearm twice from the tester and smells great but unless I put my arm to my nose I don't smell it, not sure if olfactory"
57544,"Around 4 sprays, each side of the neck, my chest and my wrist and I just dab the other one. This fragrance is actually very loud. It projects and lasts minimum 8 hours on my skin."
57545,">Burberry London For Men

This is a fab deal for a great smelling perfume.  Can also find this at Marshalls or Ross."
57546,"Indeed. Truly a sleeper cologne. Maybe a coincidence, but all of the compliment I get from this cologne are from Asian women."
57547,"1. YSL La Nuit
2. CDNIM
3. Armani Code Absolu
4. Versace Eros
5. John varvatos vintage"
57548,"I have a few different colognes for different occasions.

* 1. Dior Sauvage - Safe scent, need to go easy on the trigger with this one. It's extremely popular and if you're at an event/wedding you'll probably notice it on other people.
* 2. Prada L'Homme - the cologne I wear when I'm on the job. Very clean and inoffensive. Smells like expensive soap with the prominent iris note.
* 3. La Nuit de L'Homme - This one is for dates/close encounters, it doesn't last the longest or project too far, but that's not the point, it's sensual and soft yet masculine.
* 4. Dior Fahrenheit - This one is a classic from the 80's, it has a unique gasoline-type of note that comes from the leather/violet leaf, this one works on cold winter days.
* 5. Creed Aventus - I only wear this one on special occasions, I lucked out and got a bottle at Costco for around $70. You'll see a lot of hype online for it, but it's definitely not worth the high price tag of $300+ in my opinion.

Best advice I can give is to go to your local department store and get some samples and see what jumps out at you. Don't get too sucked into what you see online or what girls say is their favourite, in reality as long as you apply the right amount (1-2 sprays) and the cologne works with your body chemistry, you're going to smell good regardless of what you choose."
57549,"Listen to this guy. He knows what he is talking about. 

If the Aventus does interest you, Armaf Club De Nuit Intense Man is a cheap knock off that’s really close. Might be worth trying out."
57551,"I want to provide a counter argument to this as about a year ago I bought about 7 perfumes all at once from never having bought my own perfume in my life.

I got some of the top recommended cheap and expensive perfumes but didn't want to shell out for Aventus and the ridiculous price but saw people recommend the knockoff Armaf version so tried it.
I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the only perfume that I ever got a compliment and random people asking what the smell was, at a cash register and i was dressed in sweatpants at the time.

It smells like lemon fresh when you put it on and I didn't see the appeal, but when the initial smell goes away and you forget about it, men and women both really like the smell although I have no idea if it smells like Aventus."
57552,"> It smells like lemon fresh when you put it on and I didn't see the appeal, but when the initial smell goes away and you forget about it, men and women both really like the smell although I have no idea if it smells like Aventus.

It's very close. Aventus has a stronger pineapple on the opening compared to CDNIM's blast of artificial lemon, but within half an hour they're really difficult to tell apart unless you're smelling them next to each other."
57553,Why do you keep wearing it
57558,"Lmaooo, grammar advice for a successful Reddit experience"
57559,"Hmm, I’m not sure you used the prober verb tense there."
57560,"I'm not sure why you've been downvoted but tbf when I read your first post I just assumed you'd used ""not done"" instead of ""done"", because why would any one wear a cologne for a year that they don't like. Reads a bit like an oxymoron."
57561,How is he gonna go to the store and see what jumps out at him if he doesn't have a sense of smell!?
57562,"Just want to point out that Sephora carries men's fragrances and they will give you little samples to take home with you if you ask. Last time I was there I walked out with 4 Tom Ford samples. They just spray from the tester into small little spray vials. The Bloomingdale's near me was very pushy and would not give my anything to take home, so this was a blessing."
57563,"Sephora also sells little bags with 12 samples for like 60 bucks, and there's a coupon inside for a free bottle of one of those colognes. So you try them out, pick your favorite, and then go back to get a full bottle.

My girlfriend and I have been going through samples and trying to decide on our favorite. It's been a fun experience for the two of us."
57564,A free bottle of cologne for $60?? Sign me up!

57567,Most likely.
57568,"To add to this, OP needs to understand that those fragrance types (woodsy, floral, etc) *can* (but not always) correspond to a season.  Floral scents are out of place in a cold winter and better suited for spring and summer weather, for example.  This is, of course not a hard rule.

I’d also recommend finding a decanting service that will sell better functional samples (1oz bottles usually) to get a better feel for a scent than a department store or speciality store’s samples.  

Oh, and find a good scent-neutral deodorant.  You don’t want to rock your Old Spice or whatever when you’re wearing a lovely scent."
57569,"I’ll second the ysl la nuit d’homme. I get more compliments on that than any other cologne. 

Also creed aventus is great but overhyped for the money. I don’t agree that the knockoff from armauf is the same."
57570,"Following this thread for awhile now, can someone explain the difference to me between Yves L'Homme and Yves La Nuit L'Homme? They seemed some of the most mentioned, is one markedly better?"
57571,"I’ve worn both for like a decade now, the La Nuit is a warmer and “moodier” version of the standard YSL. I made a mistake last year and got the new “Y” and it’s just not as good as the L’Homme base scent.

Neither is better, they’re just suited to different scenarios. I find I can wear the regular fragrance all the time however with La Nuit more... intimate situations?

Get some samplers. Never buy fragrance based on reddit text descriptions or you end up dropping mad dollar on Aventus, when the best Creed fragrance is actually Green Irish Tweed."
57572,"Thank you! Now Im looking for an inoffensive cologne for work. Theres someone I really want to think I smell good, but I dont want to annoy anyone in the office. Would YSl L'Homme be more appropriate than La Nuit? Or would Aventus/Green Irish Tweed be better?"
57573,"L'Homme is what you would wear when visiting in-laws.

La Nuit de L'Homme is what you would wear on a date.

L'Homme: safe

La Nuit: sexy"
57574,"Dior Homme is my favorite during the colder seasons. Smells thick, sweet and woody. The smell is quite strong so I advice to keep down the doses to the minimum"
57575,"I use only Dior Homme, who has tile for 5 different bottles ? I can't believe he prefers Sauvage or Fahrenheit to the regular one."
57576,Is it normal to find fragrances at Costco? I can't remember ever seeing any there.
57577,How did you find it at Costco?  Was it a sale or special mark down only in your area?
57578,They sold it not too long ago (summer I believe) and it’s marked down significantly from retail.
57579,Good list. Hits the safe scents that IMO work on most people. I'll reinforce going to a department store. Spray it - go holiday shopping - see how you like it on your skin.
57580,This guy smells
57581,"I have never worn cologne before. How do you usually apply it to yourself?

1-2 sprays how far away from body? what areas ect."
57582,Not a fan of aventus. Green irish tweed is where it is at. Check out /r/fragsplits to try it some of these high dollar colognes for cheap.
57583,Dior Sauvage is an addicting scent.
57584,What are my chances of finding Dior Sauvage & Creed Aventus at Costco?
57585,What’s the safest inexpensive scent? I’ve never used any purely because I prefer to smell of nothing (how you smell after a shower). Maybe I should try incorporating some scents.
57586,"Margiela’s fragrance line, Replica, has some really nice scents. My personal favorite is Jazz Club. Travel sizes are available at $28 (which has lasted me a year so far) and a larger bottle at around $120."
57587,Can confirm. Was in Sephora the other day looking for gifts; ended up smelling like over 10 colognes but Margiela’s was one of my favourites. They also describe the scent on the label of each one in classic MM fashion so that’s also pretty cool (I was looking at the 3-pack one).
57588,"Came here to second any recommendations of Margiela’s Replica scents. I had been wearing Pac Sun for ages since a high school girlfriend got it for me. Tried Dior’s sauvage as a daily driver but it was too distractingly strong for me and I kept noticing when other guys would wear it around me and feel unoriginal. 

Finally took my girlfriend to Sephora this summer with some time to spare and had her pick out her favorite Margiela scents and a few others to try on me to see how she thought they would wear on me. Jazz club had caught my eye and she loved the idea of the Barber shop Replica but the one that won out was Music Festival Replica. It’s been my favorite daily driver for all of fall now. Check out the Margiela Replica line of scents. They hold their own."
57589,"What type of situation, and season, would you recommend these for? How strong are they?"
57590,"I can't speak for all 16 of the Replica scents because I don't remember all of them off the top of my head and didn't even see the Replica Fantasies when I was in the store but for the three that I mentioned, Jazz Club, Barber Shop, and Music Festival, here's my impressions.   


Jazz Club is the darker, and strongest of the three. It's suited for date nights, dinner outings, and other evening outings. Compared to other brands, it's a comparatively medium strength scent.   


Barber Shop has a very clean and professional, almost soap-ey scent. It's the least imposing of the three scents here and I could see it being good for a suit-and-tie office/morning interview setting.   


Music Festival is the sweetest of these three by a bit and definitely can leave a bit of a ghost of a scent on T-shirts worn over it. It's not so strong that it would be out of place for a brunch get-together, coffee-shop interview, or open house but it's not the first thing I would reach for when getting ready for a formal interview.   


Hope these were answering the questions you asked sufficiently."
57591,just got the travel size of this one! how often do you use it?
57592,"Yep, it’s 10 mL. I’ve used it basically 5 or 6 days out of the week since last December and still have some to spare."
57593,10ml? Over that time period used that frequently and you still have some??? How?
57594,"Well, there are some days where I don’t really do anything so I don’t use any. And when I do it’s only one spritz. I actually just checked and I still have a fourth left lol"
57595,"Smell is a memory trigger.  Think of the age group you want to make an impression with, find the #1 cologne seller in a 5 year window of when they were 21 on either side..  Wear that."
57596,This guy fucks
57597,"Sex Panther by Odeon, illegal in nine countries."
57598,Am 21. Need halp.
57599,Time to re-up on the Axe bby
57600,"Now, I don't have much experience with cologne... But even deployed I don't wear that god forsaken crap that is Axe in a can."
57601,yeah it was a joke
57602,"Honestly axe isn't bad, just gets a bad rap from teens over spraying. The company employs some top noses when making those formulations.

Dark Temptation is an A*Men clone, while Bond No. 9 copied Axe Peace when creating Scent of Peace."
57603,"Cold blooded, savagely calculated. Kudos."
57604,I smell Hollister on a random stranger and think of malls and a dick college roommate.
57605,This is why Tommy Boy is my daily.
57606,How would you find something like that?
57607,How do you even find those stats? Top 5 seller for 25-30 year old?
57608,Probably google like “best selling cologne of 2003”
57609,"Bro forreal, you know how many times I’ll find some cologne I used to wear years back and the instant I take a whiff I get a rush of memories"
57610,Daaamn. Pretty genius
57611,"Creed Green Irish Tweed was an MFA favorite for several years, but at over $200 a bottle a bit out of my price range. Someone made an off-hand comment that Armaf Tres Nuit was an Irish Tweed knock-off available on Amazon for less than $30 so I decided to try that. I've gotten more compliments on my cologne in the past two years then in the previous 30 combined. Definitely a ""go to"" cologne for me."
57612,Stirling Soap's Sharp Dressed Man is an affordable alternative to Green Irish Tweed
57613,+1. I get complimented constantly on how good I smell with Armaf. Really good value.
57614,"I tried looking for it on Amazon, there's a lot of mixed reviews saying it has been reformulated and lasts maybe half an hour, or smells overwhelmingly like alcohol, so I'm skeptical. Would you mind including a link that had worked for you recently?"
57615,"Buy a cologne sample kit from Sephora. Comes with 15 common ones, you can try them out, decide which you like, and use a voucher for $65 off whatever you pick. Have other people smell them and buy the one that you and everyone else likes!"
57616,"I second this recommendation, it's perfect for people like OP."
57617,I’ll probably get voted down for this but...the cologne I get the most compliments on is Bath and Bodyworks blue color. I swear I wear everything from it to Tom Ford Costa Azzura and Tobacco Vanille and I get at least one daily compliment on it and it’s about $30.
57618,I was seeing this guy once and I thought he smelled really good and really unique. The cologne he was using was a Bath and Bodyworks peach thing
57619,I feel the same about Adidas moves for guys. It's the cheapest cologne I've bought and have received by far the most compliments on it
57620,I’ve tried that one but it smells a bit too soapy for me and somehow more athletic than I ever feel.
57621,Same. Great cologne.
57622,I’ve been wearing their mahogany one for prob 4-5 years and love it too
57624,L’Occitane is always amazing
57625,You fragrant man marry that lady immediately if not sooner
57626,"I can help!

Margeiella Replica has some great scents - Fireplace is one of my daily scents. It’s very sweet and Smokey. It’s genderless, but male dominant. Jazz Club is definitely date night material and it sticks to you which is cool. I have two more Margellas but I just got them and don’t know them that well. One is basically coconut and smells like tanning oil, and one is tanning oil and oud. They’re interesting but I’m not in love with either one, pretty much a summer wedding day and summer wedding night occasion. Maybe some beach days or workouts with a “friend”.

Tom Ford is the next brand I wear a lot of. The regular and extreme noir are both great but the showstopper is the oud wood. It’s basically male pheromones and sophistication in a bottle. It’s definitely strong and overpowers you while you’re getting ready, but it’ll fade on your way to a spot, and then stick. Don’t worry too much about that initial strong smell. They have a new one Tobacco Vanilla, which isn’t like a Home Goods candle, it legit smells like a sweet Cuban and freshly ground up vanilla paste.

I also like YSL - they have two scents, I think just called L’Homme and the L’Homme intense. The regular one is like a summer or spring scent you can go nuts and it won’t overpower anyone. The intense is definitely an evening scent but nothing crazy, just a nice spice and cinnamon hint.


Another couple honorable mentions are Ralph Loren Oud and Ralph Loren Leather. Both dark and heavy but good. 

To be honest tho, go with a friend with a good nose and try a few of these out. Your skin will react to them differently. I actually get a bit itchy with a few of mine and have to careful where to spray. My neck is pretty sensitive and I have to do shoulders, back of the head, and chest instead sometimes. 

I’m not a baller, my wife just works at L’Oreal and she gets a free bottle basically every other month or we can buy em for 60% off any time.  She picks them out (except for the Tom Ford, that’s just me). 

My favorite smells are scotch, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, wood, coconut, raisins, and leather. I don’t like herbal, floral scents. I have a pretty shit nose."
57627,"do you have any idea what the general opinion on that paco rabanne One Million is? i havent see. it thus far. i like it, i dont know how to explain it, nor am i very well studied in colognes haha, but its not an.. assaulting smell like others can be. its smooth and almost natural. 

if youre catching my flow, do you know any others that are like that?"
57628,"The general opinion of the original 1 Million in the fragrance community is it's played out. I recently got a 50ml bottle of it's latest flanker, Lucky, for about $50. I'd recommend checking out others in the line or stick with what you like."
57629,Bleu De Chanel is a classic and I’ve never had any complaints.
57630,I'm wearing the same. The Eu de toilette variant (sp?)
57631,This is my go to for an evening - platinum egoiste is also nice.
57632,This is my current go to. Great scent. I went with the weaker concentration
57633,"You have to go try them on yourself, and maybe get a friend to come with you. Different scents work for different people.

People have said they like floral & fresh on me. I've tried the oriental fragrances and they smell like aged piss on me. I use Giorgio Armani ""Acqua di Gio"" simply because I can buy it at Macy's for like 50% off with coupons. Call me basic, it's ok. I like it and it's not offensive to people."
57634,"> I use Giorgio Armani ""Acqua di Gio"" simply because I can buy it at Macy's for like 50% off with coupons. Call me basic, it's ok. I like it and it's not offensive to people.

Same. It's extremely safe, and at the right time of the year, you can get it on deep discount. I don't love it personally, but it's an easy 'go to' option for a lot of us."
57635,I use Acqua do Gioa (sp?). I love it. Worn it for years. I didn't know you could get those great deals. What time of year do you get deep discounts? Please say Christmas! 😊
57636,Where have you been getting your coupons from? I've been meaning to buy a bottle.
57637,"My top five-ish would be as follows.

1.	⁠Creed Aventus
2.	⁠YSL L'Homme (original version and La Nuit are good)
3.	⁠Hermes Terre d'Hermes (EDT works better for me than EDP)
4.	⁠Penhaligon Sartorial (Endymion is a close second)
5.	⁠Frederic Malle Geranium Pour Monsieur

Bonus: Amouage Jubilation XXV"
57638,The YSL has been my go to for a long time. Love it. Very classy smell.
57639,Terre d'Hermes is my goto. Works well.
57641,They both share a very similar earthy-citrus scent. The EDP is just more potent than the EDT.
57642,I wear Aventus and get compliments all the time.
57643,"Jubilation XXV is my special occasion frag, good call. Thoughts on Penhaligon overall?"
57644,"In general I like the scents from Penhaligon. Sartorial and Endymion are the only two that wow'd me enough to make the purchases. I think their line may be getting a little too saturated with the Portrait line.

On a side note after a lengthy discussion with a Penhaligon rep there is actually a narrative that goes along with the Portrait line and how all the ""characters"" relate and interact with one another."
57645,Excellent choices
57646,Prada Luna Rossa Carbon
57647,You like the Carbon? I was much more fond of the Black myself
57648,"Yes, carbon's scent is very similar to Dior Sauvage, but without the harshness from the ambroxan."
57649,"I really like Eau Sauvage (not to be confused with Dior Sauvage), one of the all time classics. My other favorite is Caswell Massey Lime, which has been discontinued and has left me heartbroken. If anyone's familiar with this scent specifically and can offer a recommendation of something that's similar, please feel free to chime in (but please don't suggest Royall Lyme, not even close)!"
57650,"Armani Code
Acqua De Gio
Desert Eau De Toilette"
57651,From a woman’s perspective....YSL L’Homme ALL THE WAY!
57652,"Do you guys wear  cologne to work?

Edit : I haven't worn cologne in like 10 years. Givenchy pi."
57653,Chanel egoíst platinum
57654,Great one
57655,Givenchy Gentleman
57656,"A patchouli-bomb from another era. Try before you buy, it's not for all, but they never are, are they?"
57657,"I will add a +1 for YSL La Nuit De L'homme which I wear for dates or more serious events in colder temperatures. 

I personally prefer a lighter and a more fruity scent for warmer temperatures and my go to is Bvlgari Pour L'homme and Voyage by Nautica

Other more options I've tried and liked (and gotten compliments for) include: Dior Homme Intense, A&F Fierce, Jo Malone London Wood Sage and Sea Salt (this is very strong stuff but great for the cooler temps), Versace Eros (probably too citrus-y for your taste)

But ultimately trying samples at a sephora or department store is a great way to try out different smells. But be careful! Trying too many at once will convolute the scent!"
57658,"Having somebody pitch brands at you probably won’t help much.  The tricky thing about fragrances is how they interact with your own chemistry.  What smells awesome on one person might smell like bug spray on another.  Some people can make most anything smell cheap or like baby powder.  Smelling it off a sample card, or even immediately after spritzing yourself, could be misleading.  I don’t trust my impression of anything until it’s been on me for fifteen minutes or so.  Feel free to try what people are recommending (last thing I found I really liked on me was Frédéric Malle’s Bois d’Orage), but if you have trouble smelling it yourself, I don’t see any way around it but to enlist a face-to-face person whose opinion you trust."
57659,"Plenty of advice has been given but I'm just gonna give my two cents.

First of all, fragrance is something subjective and there's no guide on which fragrances are right and wrong. Asking which fragrances are ""the best"" is like asking which food is the best. Different people like different things. But, like with food, there are certain fragrances that are universally loved. Like how pretty much everyone loves pizza or ice cream.

So, what I would recommend:

**The all-rounder**  
Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme - If you just want 1 fragrance, this is the one I'd recommend. Works everywhere. Class? Yes. Clubs? Yes. Warm or cold temperature? Doesn't matter.

**The sexy fragrance**  
YSL La Nuit De L'Homme - When it comes to scent solely, this one probably garners the best female reactions. Smells seductive, sensual and masculine.

**The ""night out"" fragrance**  
Jean-Paul Gaultier Ultra Male (or: Versace Eros) - For clubbing you want something sweet and sexy, but a bit louder.

I think those 3 fragrance types make a great foundation: one ""day-to-day"" fragrance, one ""date"" fragrance and one ""night out"" fragrance.

If you however want to go even beyond 3, there are plenty of other fragrances that I can recommend for different situations.

For example:

**The upscale fragrance**  
Prada L'Homme (or: YSL L'Homme) - Whenever you're in a formal or business situation and want to smell nice, but don't want to risk coming of as inappropriate.

**The ""hot weather"" fragrance**  
Dior Sauvage - Nice, fresh smell which can pretty much be worn to any occasion, as long as it's quite warm.

**The ""cold weather"" fragrance**  
Viktor&Rolf Spicebomb Extreme - Nice, sweet and spicy smell which can pretty much be worn to any occasion, as long as it's quite cold.

Once you have those 6 categories filled in, you should be knowledgable enough to make your own decisions when it comes to fragrances, because you've pretty much had a taste of everything on the fragrance spectrum.

Also, I'm 20 so you don't have to worry about me recommending any ""old man"" scents. And I hang out at r/fragrance quite often."
57660,This is really helpful! Can you please tell me what the difference is between Prada L'Homme and YSL L'Homme?
57661,"Prada L'Homme smells a bit more mature and luxurious than YSL L'Homme. What they have in common is that they both have this clean and inoffensive vibe.

YSL L'Homme is what you would wear when visiting your in-laws or your grandparents. Prada L'Homme is what you would wear to your job.

I would personally recommend Prada L'Homme, because I think Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme can be worn in the same situations that one would wear YSL L'Homme, but it's also more versatile."
57662,"Gucci Guilty Black (intense version is nice too), jimmy Choo “Man”"
57664,r/fragsplits can really help with finding which frags you do/don't like on the (relatively) cheap. Only trusted guys doing the selling/splitting.
57665,/r/FragDecants  is also a great resource for buying smaller quantities of fragrances. I've bought small bottles of a bunch of Creeds which I never would have bought at full retail.
57666,I’m surprised the classic PUA answer of “no cologne” hasn’t shown up here.
57667,"Maybe it's just me but is cologne really all that common in under 40s?

The only times I smell cologne is on older men.

The only time I am aware of men's smell is if they are clean (bath soap smell) or really dirty."
57668,"None, or a lot less than you think you should be wearing. I shouldn’t have to smell (or taste!) your cologne when you’re not even in the room anymore."
57669,"Yeah I'm really not a fan of manufactured scents, I thought about leaving that comment but it seemed unhelpful lol. I'm a sensitive nose boy."
57670,wearing cologne is like playing music out loud in public
57671,"Bvlgari Aqva is the scent that gets me the most compliments. Never really see anyone talk about it, but i love it for a night out (and it's little brother Aqva Marine for a daytime scent)!"
57672,Tauerville makes some unique scents that I enjoy. Particularly this one: http://tauerperfumes.com/l-air-du-desert-marocain.html
57673,"L'air du Désert is an absolute masterpiece of a fragrance! I'm sad I've run out, its pretty unisex too which I love."
57674,"People recommending one scent or another aren't really answering your question. You need to pick a scent that matches your personal body chemistry. 

How do you do that? Take a shower using unscented soap the night before. The next day, don't do anything to get yourself dirty or sweaty, then go in to a department store and ask for help in the perfume section. They will let you test some scents on paper slips. Narrow it down to 3-4 scents, then pick one and spray some on a clean body part such as the crook of your elbow or whatever - NOT YOUR WRIST or anywhere near your hands because they will get dirty through your day even if you try to avoid it. Walk around the store for a half an hour to let the scent ""mature"" and then sniff that spot. 

If you like it, go for it. If not, spray something else that you liked somewhere else, walk around for 30 minutes, and see how it goes. You need to let the scent sit on your skin for a while before you know if it's ""for you"" or not. Someone else's recommendation might not work for you so don't just go buy the most popular thing in this thread. Cologne is very personal and there's no ""wrong"" or ""right"" choice."
57675,Yves St Laurent L'Homme. Get compliments from everyone.
57676,"Givenchy play, you really need to smell it"
57677,"Just go into a shop and don't come out until you find one you really like. Listening to random other people is a total waste of time, because you could pick 'the best one in the world' as recommended by many people, but it's just as likely someone like me would think you smell gross.... Pick something neutral if you don't want to be bold, or just whatever the hell you like if you do. You're the one who has to smell it all day after all."
57678,"As others have suggested, La Nuit de L’Homme (by Yves Saint Laurent)

* Great for the cold season
* A main note is cedar (matching your 'woody' preference)

My other suggestion is Guerlain Homme Intense (by Guerlain)

* Perfect for for Fall/Spring
* Has a fresh mojito vibe, has cedar base
* Also works well during the Summer

If you want to switch it up for summer, then I'd suggest L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme (by Issey Miyake)

* Bright as a summer day; don't overspray
* Fresh citrus opening, somewhat 'herby', cedar base

If you can swing it, Oud Wood (by Tom Ford) or Grey Vetiver (by Tom Ford)

* Never-go-wrong year-round
* Very clean, very masculine

If you want to buy the hype, Creed Aventus

* Super overhyped
* But is a very good scent, depending on the batch
* Try to buy batch 18B11, other formulations may disappoint

If you can, try on at a mall Sephora. To buy, check out fragrancenet.com (the site frequently has 30% off 'coupons')"
57679,"Anecdote, but when I used my credit card on fragrancenet.com, I immediately had fraudulent charges posted the next day. Not sure how they're storing the credit card numbers, but that site isn't secure *in my experience*."
57680,"If you’re just making your foray into fragrance, I definitely recommend starting small/cheap to find what scent you like. I did this, and here’s a couple that I like:

1.	Reyane Insurrection II Pure: Pretty fruity and sweet. Lots of compliments. 
2.	BVLGARI BVLGARI BLACK: Smells like leather and vanilla. I like to wear this at night when I go out. 
3.	Encore Noir: if you want woody and aromatic, try this one. Some say it smells a little synthetic though. Very strong in my experience. 

I recently just picked up testers for YSL L’Homme after hearing about it for so long, and it’s great. Pretty inoffensive and got a lot of compliments on my first time wearing it. 

I also picked up a tester for Prada L’Homme which smells great too. Quite powdery but slightly woody as well."
57681,"I have gotten the most compliments from Hanae Mori. Don't seem to find others with it, so you should be good on that front."
57682,"Ditto on Hanae Mori, I use HM in the summer and HiM year round. Great for us college kids on a budget, though I should have gone with the EDP. Will next time!"
57683,"Just for a point of reference but using the term ""cologne"" is misleading and factually incorrect. Yes men like to use the word cologne when it comes to what they wear because it is deemed masculine but in reality a cologne is different from what they or you are most likely wearing. Like all of these suggestions down below, none of them are actually colognes. 

This is a ""the more you know"" kinda post"
57684,"To add to this, fragrance is typically the term that should be used instead."
57685,Check out le labo’s Santal 33.
57686,Personal favorite. Wear it everyday and I love it.
57689,Seconded. Walked into class with this on and I had 4 girls stop me before I got to my seat and demand to smell me. Never had this before
57690,"This, I love Dylan Blue. Get plenty of compliments on it."
57691,THIS
57692,What about Eau fraiche? Is that any good?
57693,Smells so good. Always get compliments with this one.
57694,Very Sexy For Him by Victoria secret. It's amazing and you'll probably be the only guy you know wearing it. Don't get VS2 though
57695,John Varvatos Classic. I'm surprise not that many people mention it.
57696,"May I suggest you use 1/4 the amount you think you need. A little goes a long way, and you want women to come closer for a better whiff. If your cooking announces your arrival, you are wearing too much.  Seriously!!! A little goes a very long way."
57697,I use Tom Ford champaca absolute.
57698,"Anyone else still spritz on the Express cologne? 

...maybe I need to upgrade"
57699,"Creed Aventus if you can afford it.  


Dior also has a nice line up as well ($325 range)."
57700,For a subtle scent (that will only be noticeable when someone gets close to you) I recommend Burberry Touch.
57701,"Trust me when I say this:

Comme Des Garcons - Amazingreen

Best cologne I've ever had, and the only one I use since I've gotten it."
57702,Yo there's a whooooooole subreddit for this with a weekly suggestions thread: r/fragrance. Good luck!
57703,Gucci guilty
57704,"I know you’re looking for a cologne suggestion, but you might want to consider just not wearing cologne at all. Of course it’s nice to smell nice, but “nice” is very subjective. Smelling like nothing (or maybe like your soap or laundry detergent) is always the least offensive to the most people. 

Edit: And, wearing no cologne will never be a deal breaker. Wearing [cologne name] might be a turn off."
57705,"Currently using
- Ermenegildo Zegna Javanese Patchouli
- Mancera Wind Wood
- Dior Homme Intense"
57706,I'm a Burberry London kinda guy.
57707,"I prefer no cologne and actively avoid people wearing it . Just fyi that's something that happens. I have a sensitive nose, but I know recovering alcoholics also avoid cologne in cases."
57708,For all of you wanting to try these expensive smells check out /r/fragsplits
57709,The important part to remember: smells should be discovered not announced.
57710,I'm a big fan of Versace Eau Fraiche. definitely a strong fresh smell.
57711,Personal favorite: Jake from Hollister. About $40 a bottle and well worth it. Been wearing it for about 10 years now
57712,"I think it’s most important to establish the reason you want to wear cologne. You say you don’t have much of a sense of smell, so I would imagine it’s because you want others to like the way you smell. Specifically, it seems you want a smell to attract the opposite sex. In my experience women tend to like blue, and spicy scents. 

I see a lot of people recommending creed on here, but I really can’t stand the smell of any of their scents personally, but I’d definitely consider at least checking them out if you’re willing to drop a lot of money. 

For blue/water scents I’d recommend these for each category:

Budget: *Cool Water for Men by Davidoff Coolwater*

Classic blue scent, wears lightly on the skin, and is super inoffensive even to people who dislike colognes. Light lavender notes and some mint but really heavy on the water.

Average: *Issey Miyake L’eau D’Issey Pour Homme*

Still the classic blue scent but with a bit more depth. Nice citrus notes and some spice come through with a fairly woodsy finish.

High End: *Byredo Gypsy Water*

The most complex of any blue scent I’ve come across. Very peppery with nice citrus notes. Loads of juniper with a slightly sweet base of vanilla and sandalwood. 

(I’ll note that I prefer almost any other scent to blue scents but they’re super inoffensive and women in my experience *really* love them) 

For Spicier Scents I’d just go with *Royall Lyme Bermuda’s* stuff

It’s classic spice depending on the style you get. Each one as good as the other.  Loads of warm and fresh spice albeit extremely palatable. It’s inexpensive and it’s what many would call “timeless”. 

My personal favorite cologne of all time, however, is Tom Ford’s Oud Wood. Tons of compliments every time I wear it, but unfortunately expensive and heavy. Great for winter with tons of Oud and pepperiness. I wouldn’t recommend this one to you because you mentioned your sense of smell isn’t that great. It’s super easy to go overboard when applying it and no one wants to be around the guy who’s cologne is going to nauseate them. 

Best of luck buying cologne. I hope this was helpful."
57713,"For me, the best resource for fragrance info and recomendations have been Jeremy Fragrance https://www.youtube.com/user/Jeremyfragrance His top 10 lists are very good."
57714,"I like YSL - la nuit de l’homme for winter/fall

Polo blue for an all year round scent

Armani - Aqua di gio EDP, and Davidoff coolwater in the summer

Your best bet is to go to a store, try a scent on your wrist and see how you like it over the following few hours.

Some good reviews in youtune might give you an idea of what to try"
57715,YSL L’Homme original gets me a lot of compliments. On par with Creed Aventus believe it or not.
57716,"My top 3

1. TF Fucking Fabulous 
2. TF Tuscan Leather
3. Kilian Oud"
57717,I used to go with Polo Red but then an old girlfriend got me to wear CK Dark Obsession and I've been wearing that ever since. They're both more on the musty/woodsy side of cologne. i would suggest going to like a Sephora or Macys and trying a bunch of samples. I also like Lacoste Yellow as a summer scent.
57718,How do people here feel about drakkar noir
57720,"I definitely recommend Spicebomb as well. I bought it when I was specifically looking for something a bit more unique and memorable. Even though it stands out, I've never had anyone tell me that it bothers them. Just don't try to bring the bottle on an airplane; it looks like a grenade.

As an added plus, my partner wears Flowerbomb (also by V&R) so when we go out, she and I can even wear matching fragrances"
57722,"Heck you are 24 and seem to be single. Might be 8 years late but there is always room on the Paco Rabanne 1 Million club. 

Prob will get hate but the ladies like it.

Just don't get Sauvage. That shit is for old malt whiskey sipping dudes. 

Also if you want to start cheaper look into Ed Hardy Skulls and Roses. It smells pretty much like Montblanc Legend Spirit for alot less."
57723,"Try Naughtica Voyage, it's a nice mild smell that lasts a good time, not over powering."
57724,"Chanel Allure sport is light, clean and fresh. 

La Nuit de L’ homme from YSL. Can’t go wrong."
57725,"I really like Bottega Veneta, sort of a woody, peppery scent. Personally, I hate really sweet smells, and opt for more of a woody smelling cologne. Give it a try! About 100 bucks a bottle."
57726,"I'm always a little hesitant, but something that caught my eye was a subscription service, every month you get sent a months worth and that month you could ask the ladies/opinions you value, what there thought is.

Here is a YouTube video that has tips on choosing new cologne. I know that I had heard about new subscription  service on cologne scents....but I can't find it.

[https://youtu.be/2eLWPFKouec](https://youtu.be/2eLWPFKouec)"
57727,I know Scentbird is a subscription service like you describe.  I haven't tried it because I'm Canadian though so I can't comment on it.
57728,saint rita parlor's rose whiskey tobacco scent is my favorite.  It's a small company and the owner is really nice.  I met him at a shop in Brooklyn last month.  Definitely a company worth supporting.
57729,Made to Measure by Gucci smells heavenly on a man.
57730,"Ultimate go-to for me is Perry Ellis red. Most of their stuff isn't amazing,  but that one is awesome.  It's a great,  inexpensive aqua di gio clone that works in almost any day time situation.  Very fresh and bright. I have about 30 colognes and I've used half a bottle of that stuff.  Another good one I wear a lot is Unpredictable Adventure,  which is an Aventus clone. I've heard there is an even better clone out there,  but I haven't tried it.  It smells great though, can be worn almost any time. These are both very inexpensive and very high quality for the price. If you haven't bought cologne before, I don't recommend dropping 300 bucks on one bottle when you don't even know what you like,  and there are many many high quality inexpensive brands/ clones/ testers out there. 

Also:  love love love Noble Fig by Ferrari. I wear it all the time in the summer.  I've heard their bergamot one is great too."
57731,Places like /r/fragsplits really helped me get a variety of different high end fragrances.
57732,Versace Dylan Blue is one of my favorites to wear and i get TONS of compliments.
57733,I’m fond of [Bawston & Tucker](https://bawstonandtucker.com/) solid cologne. You can get a sample set of their different scents for fairly cheap and find one or a few that you like.
57734,"Mont Blanc Legend is my sort and I also love Gucci Guilty. As other mentionned, a perfume is a memory trigger. Go around and smell them, you can even ask for little sample bottles which last for a few nights, it really gives you the experience !"
57735,"My go-to scent is Guerlain's L'Homme Ideal, because strangers (including women) have told me I smell good, whenever I wear it out."
57736,"YSL, Dior sport."
57737,"Ive always loves One Million by Paco Rabanne, and Versace Eros always gets a lot of compliments. Also Jean Claude Gaultiers signature cologne Le Male is incredible. Ive always loved vanilla inspired sandalwood type scents, and they always worked well for me. But that guys right, you have to see what works for you"
57738,Acqua di Gio by Armani. Never received as many compliments as this fragrance
57739,"Yes, came here to say this. My girlfriend thinks its orgasmic."
57740,"I was in Sephora with an ex and she pointed it out to me and said ""if you wear this I'll have sex with you anytime"" as she kept walking with her back to me I doused myself in it with a few sprays. She had a good laugh. It's since been my favorite."
57741,There's a reason like 90% of men wear it. It's the best selling cologne in history.
57742,"Agreed,  it's not super pungent and has a nice floral smell to it."
57743,"To anyone reading this: don't buy this unless you want to smell like 95% of all other men out there. It's a great scent, but holy cow everyone and their father wears it."
57744,Check out [Acqua di Gio Profumo](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Giorgio-Armani/Acqua-di-Gio-Profumo-29727.html). It's tied for my favorite cologne of all time. I appreciate it MUCH more than the original.
57745,"Ah yes the ""dark aquatic"" they came out with a while back. Stellar scent."
57746,"Gonna piggyback off this comment since I also use Acqua di Gio:

Compliments on fragrance are as much about the person and their relationship to you as it is about the smell.

Ever had someone say ""Oh that's a nice shirt"" despite it being one you've worn dozens of times before? Or ""Hey I like your haircut"" even though it's the same style you always get?

People who are close to you (or friendly strangers) will decide first (maybe subconsciously) that they want to pay you a compliment, and then will pick up on something noticeable. That shirt, your hair, how you smell.

Despite all the comments I read on here and countless other websites about being complimented by total strangers on how you smell, I have never had a single unsolicited compliment on any of my fragrances. 

I have AdG, 1 Million, Le Male, all the top 'compliment getters'. I don't own them for that reason, but IMO there's no such thing as a fragrance that will get you compliments. It's a combination of your personality, the other person's personality, and the social situation you're in. Your fragrance just happens to stand out more as a 'thing to be complimented on' compared to your shirt or your haircut etc."
57747,"I think there's a lot of truth to what you're saying, although I still believe people when they say they're getting unsolicited compliments. 

I haven't received too many compliments from people that I wasn't close to, like you're suggesting, but I have noticed that women are often a lot friendlier to me when I'm wearing a fragrance. I don't wear fragrances often so I notice out of trend behavior, although that's an ambiguous situation and there could be something else going on (confidence, or whatever)."
57748,I have this as well along with 2 others. This is definitely my go to.
57750,Dillard's
57751,"Which one of these is that:
http://www.boots.com/armani/armani-acquai-di-gio"
57752,Is it the acqua di gio pou homme? Because thats what i get up when sesrching hm
57753,"> For me it's probably La Nuit De L'Homme, I've had girls give me a 'hug' for 3 or 4 minutes with their face buried into my neck smelling me.

*adds to shopping cart*"
57754,"Granted she was quite drunk but that happened haha, it's great because while others think it's played out l, where I'm from I'm the only one wearing it and I've to buy it online, so when guys here girls compliment it they ask me what it is and I tell them, they ask where they can get it and I say 'oh it's online, not in shops around here' so that kinda puts them off and keeps it scarce."
57755,"> Creed Aventus

They sell it at the largest chainstores all over Denmark. I was actually surprised, I figured I'd have to buy it on Amazon."
57756,What sites online are reputable that carry it?
57757,"I've tried several colognes but mainly use one: Calvin Klein One. First smelled it on my dad when I was a kid and it stuck with me. My ex-girlfriend even asked to keep a bottle as it was running out so she could remember the smell. I feel that its scent is part of my identity now, so I'm reluctant to change or try anything else."
57758,"My ex gf had this, it's the unisex one right? Anytime I got ready in hers I'd use that instead of my own, great fragrance."
57759,"Yeah, it's considered unisex. Nice to know that others like it too!"
57760,"For me it's CK Obsession. He still manages to find it in stores somehow and it's just one of those smells I strongly associate with dad and is one I really like, too. His closet just smells faintly of it - it's awesome. 

I'm still looking for such a signature scent of my own. :c"
57761,"I received a CK fragrance gift set and Obsession was part of it. Might have it in a drawer somewhere. It smells pretty good if I remember correctly! Haven't been to a Macy's in awhile, but their stores have a fragrance section with all kinds of samples. That might help you find your signature scent if you have one near you!"
57762,"Alas, I'm not in the US and where I am right now, most of the testers are nicked by the staff themselves and they deny giving it out :c

I'm trying to finish off whatever craptastic ones I got gifted (some floral smelling garbage from Banana Republic called Classic and some sickly sweet thing from Burberry that makes me sneeze) and then I'll buy a new fragrance. Currently high on my list are:

a) Acqua Di Gio

b) CK One

c) L'eau D'Issey

d) Paco Rabanne (I was really surprised by this - it smelled a lot nicer than I expected it to be and it lasted *ages*)"
57763,"Colognes are an interesting subject because we all have a different idea of what we like or what we think smells good. I'm not a cologne expert, but I don't think I've smelled the same cologne on two different people, which I think speaks volumes about personal taste. If I were to buy a new cologne, it would be Acqua di Gio. I smelled it on a friend once and also in stores. Great from what I remember. Unfamiliar with the last two."
57764,*screenshots*
57765,"Realistically I would say the usual, Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier. It is considered a classic panty dropper for good reason. 

I really enjoy Burburry Brit and I get compliments on that but probably more because of how much I wear it."
57767,O fuk Yea I have this shit it smells fresh as hell
57768,Bought this as my first cologne a couple weeks ago. Love it
57769,Burberry Touch
57770,"Got a compliment from a dude on this one (it is one of his favorites) lol.

Compliments from women? I've gotten them for Prada Luna Rossa Sport, Hugo Boss Bottled, Ferrari Leather Essence, Burberry London, I think there may be another one or two I am missing.

Ninja edit: Mont Blanc Legend, Kenneth Cole Mankind Hero... I think that is it."
57771,When do you wear Burberry London? I like it a lot but I can't see myself wearing it except for special occasions or certain fall days.
57772,Whenever I dang well please. Colder days it always seems to work.
57773,"Ha yeah, I usually don't really care either but for this one it seems to have a time and place. Maybe I need to revisit it."
57774,"Creed Aventus, Dior Sauvage, and Bleu de Chanel EDT have been good compliment getters for me. Personally, I wear the fragrances for myself, but the compliments are just icing on the cake."
57775,"I'm with you on creed, I've literally had woman run up and stop me asking what I am wearing. It's insane. Well worth the price."
57776,Dior Sauvage and Bleu de Chanel represent! Those are my two favorites! I've also repeatedly heard good things about Creed Aventus. What does that actually smell like?
57777,"Like a smokey pineapple. The description probably doesn't sound good, but it smells heavenly."
57778,"I've only heard good things about Creed Aventus, not sure how I could pull it off.

My friends and girls seem to agree that La Nuit just suits me. I asked my brothers opinion of Black Orchid when I got home and he said 'oh yeah nice, it would suit you' 

I wear it for myself because I catch a whif every now and then and I remember how good it smells, but knowing the opposite sex likes it helps."
57779,"""I wear it for myself because I catch a whif every now and then and I remember how good it smells, but knowing the opposite sex likes it helps.""

That's exactly how I feel. As for Aventus, I think any guy can pull it off. It's just that good."
57780,"You can wear Aventus anytime, anywhere. I would wear it casually and feel like a badass, on a date, in a suit, in jeans, whatever. It's very versatile."
57781,"Head on over to /r/fragsplits - Aventus gets offered all the time.  

It's also my #1 with La Nuit at #2 and Dior Sauvage #3."
57782,"I wore Cooper Square by Bond No. 9 to work one day and a coworker told me that her uterus almost leapt out of her body and strangled me.

My girlfriend damn near raped me when I put on Scent of Peace for Men by the same parfumier,"
57783,Really want to try some of the Bond No. 9 fragrances but I can't find anywhere that has a tester/demo
57784,I think you can order testers from them...
57785,"I might do that actually, I hadn't actually checked the website ahah thanks"
57786,"Bond No 9 is one of my favorite houses. I feel that most of their fragrances are quite unique and last forever. I love West Side, New Harlem, I ♥️ New York for All, and Montauk."
57788,Polo red is good too.
57789,"oddly enough, this one. https://www.etsy.com/listing/196292061/the-rhymers-club-perfume-oil-absinthe?ga_search_query=rhymers&ref=shop_items_search_1"
57790,"Wow, that's cool. What else do you recommend from that seller? I never thought about fragrances on etsy."
57791,My favorite is called leaves of grass. It is very floral though so it might not be for everyone.
57792,These look really unique! Might have to check them out.
57793,Compliments?? Lol
57794,I get compliments on my hair practically every day. Although I have a sweet mullet and they're all compliments from other men... But still.
57795,"Dude, if you smell good, girls will compliment you on it regularly."
57796,Cool Waters
57797,"Honestly... Ed Hardy. 

My dad bought it for me when I was maybe 23 not knowing what douchey connotations the brand has, turns out chicks dig it."
57798,"Chrome azarro! SOOOO many women say various things to the tune of ""wow you smell good""."
57799,Can confirm. Purchased this for my husband after giving a similar compliment :)
57800,Armani Code Black
57801,Nautica. Surprisingly not a pricey cologne.
57802,Invictus by Paco Rabane
57803,"I used to have one that was just called *Cuban Gold*, it came in a tin and was shaped like a cigar. Very nice scent, very masculine and according to my exes and wife, very swell day. Not too strong, but not weak either. Always got compliments from the ladies"
57804,"Best part of the whole Cuba lineup: it is dirt dirt cheap! Find them on fragrancenet or something, you can find like 3-packs of different scents for 20-30 bucks."
57966,Joop!
57806,Joop! Do a fragrance called Black King that smells of leather and I can't decide if its cool or weird.
57807,"The Navy's official cologne, Liberty, or something."
57808,"Really, never knew that they had one! Where you get it from?"
57809,The local army navy store has it but I'm pretty sure it's available on Amazon for $20-30!
57810,"30 bucks. ""The American Line"" is the brand name. They have one for each branch and a majority of the proceeds go to benefit veterans!

My friend I would gild you if I wasn't off work with a broken ankle right now. This is absolutely in my ""to-buy"" list."
57811,"Hey, no problem! I personally really like the Navy but the Air Force is better if you like strong scents."
57812,So is the marine one just mud and crayon wax?
57813,It also includes the entire arsenal of the Marine Corps.
57814,Mmmmmm. The smell of the range....
57815,Polo Ralph Lauren Blue
57816,Guilty by Gucci seems to be popular
57817,Armani Mania.
57818,Curve crush has been the main one that people comment on for better and worse.
57819,"Mont Blanc - One Legend. 
Almost always get compliments on this one when going out."
57820,"Paco Rabanne Invictus, Bath and Body Works(yes them) Midnight, and believe it or not Aqua Velva Classic Ice Blue which is just an aftershave."
57821,Fierce by Abercrombie & Fitch.
57822,Old spice.  They say it smells like their uncle...then usually start crying and twitching.  It's all good though.
57823,I recently bought old sprice because i heard it was good. Oh nooo
57824,"> Old spice.

I mean, yeah. 

If you're in seventh grade."
57825,"Reading all of these, where would I go locally to try different samples?"
57826,"Depends where you live, pharmacy chains tend to carry some samples, other than that big department stores, usually higher priced ones carry a fragrance department with testers, that's your best bet and where I usually go"
57827,"Department stores like Macy's, Kohl's or a fragrance store in a mall."
57828,deodorant
57829,Le Male Terrible by Gauthier
57830,"Lomani - Ab Spirit Millionaire, I just got it. Smells so damn good. Previously, Aqua Di Gio."
57831,That red Bod spray.  No joke.  It's my go to.
57832,I think it's called Really Ripped Abs? Pretty much all the Bod collection is a take on a more-famous scent (for example most in the fragrance community say 24k is their take on Paco Rabanne One Million). Can't remember offhand what the red one is formulated after but might try looking it up and getting yourself a bottle.
57833,Nirvana Bourbon by Elizabeth & James. Smells like sex

57839,"My girlfriend got me some Rogue by Rhianna which smells great, but the one I wear that never fails to get a compliment or a question as to what I'm wearing is Caesar Man.  Every time."
57840,"I picked up some Rogue Man a while back too. Strange thing it smells like a mix between a ""dirty vanilla"" with a dash of La Nuit De L'Homme in it. Smells good and very reasonable price, but it does suffer the ""celeb"" flaw in that the longevity could be better."
57841,From women? None.
57842,twilight woods for men.
57843,Sauvage by Dior
57844,I've set the bar low so all of them.
57845,"Frankincense oil, just on its own. I had a colleague walk up, sniff me and tell me it was sexy. It's not overly strong so it doesn't hit you until you're close, and I like that."
57846,I get quite a lot of compliments when I wear Blue Jean's man.
57847,"Crazy that this hasn't been mentioned, but Diesel Only The Brave."
57848,I've had some good results from 'Truth' for Men by CK. I got several variations of 'you smell really good' from girls who got close enough to smell it on my neck (including my ex).
57849,My fiance loves the smell of 3-in-1 multi-purpose oil. I've used it as cologne at least once since then to fantastic effect.

57853,Dreamer by Versace.
