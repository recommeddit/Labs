41741,"Nice, let me know what you think of it... I've watched it 4 or 5 times now and notice small things each time that I missed prior."
41742,"Watched it a couple of hours ago and the behind the scenes stuff. I really liked it, great story, great effects and very well shot. Can't get over Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff from RHPS) and Bruce Spence (The gyro captain from The Road Warrior) are in it! For sure the voice over they put in would have really been a major spoiler. The director and a couple of other people in the special features have really hilarious comments about that voice over even needing to be put in at all."
41743,"Glad you liked it, I remembered Richard O'Brien from The Crystal Maze so it was quite a surprise to see him acting in a serious film. 
It's a shame they have the voice over at the start at all, known a few people that have seen the normal version with it in and as a result lost interest in the film because they could guess how it was all going to play out. 
Now I've been talking about it, I may just watch it again... Help pass this night shift I'm on."
41744,Will do. I will hopefully get to it tomorrow depending on when I get out of work.
41745,"If you get the chance, try to see the Mexican film, The Incident, directed by Isaac Ezban. I just watched it at the Busan International Film Festival, and it definitely blew my mind.

41763,"I'm still not sure if it's as smart as it appears to be, but I can't be bothered to watch it again.  One of the better attempts at time travel, but I feel like it's missing useful information that would make it a lot simpler (like Donnie darko)."
41764,"I would have to say that there is so much going on, multiple views is a must. Also, I agree that not all can be revealed,  less the movie lose its magic. I think that the physicists that wrote the movie, did a great job of making an interesting film while keeping a budget under $100,000. Almost unheard-of when talking about time travel."

41777,[Relevant XKCD.](https://xkcd.com/657/)
41778,I FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Thanks for the reminder; rewatching.
41779,"> Shutter Island

that movie is almost 10 years old now and people on /r/movies still routinely criticize it because they didnt like the twist, because it was too easy to figure out, even though they dont actually seem to know what the twist is

spoiler: [its not that DiCaprio is really a patient and not a cop, he's fully aware of that too. the twist is the very last line of the movie, its the final 10 seconds that changes everything. he wants the lobotomy to forget, because the pain of what his wife did is too much to live with, and he simply wants that to end](/spoiler)"
41780,"[Well, I think the last 10 seconds is really compelling evidence that he knows he's a patient, but at the same time, it doesn't make sense that they would willingly allow a mental patient to cause havoc on the facility, including blowing up the doctor's car.  Seems like if that was the case, they should have drugged him up and lobotomized him anyway.](/spoiler)

[Also, the last 10 seconds of the movie isn't him deciding to get the lobotomy.  It's actually a fade to black of the light tower where the proposed lobotomies take place.](/spoiler)

I think I REALLY like this movie because the ending is STILL left ambiguous with very compelling arguments on both sides.  In the end, it doesn't take away from the overall movie either."
41781,This movie is so cool! I think I’m gonna rewatch it tonight ahah
41782,"Also, the third cube movie (I believe Cube Zero) is really good. Second one is just mehhhhh."
41783,"Second one is shit. Cube Zero is good, and I almost included it, but felt the original was the best of the 3."
41784,Feel that. Plus you can watch cube zero without having to watch the second one which is cool.
41785,"Not really ""mind-melting"" as far as not being able to understand it but amazing psychological adventures: Memento and The Machinist. Both were on Netflix at one point, hopefully still are."

Jesus Christ. It's one of those movies where when it ends, you just sit there trying to process what the fuck just happened. Amazing film"

41807,I was hoping someone was going to mention the Thirteenth Floor.
41808,Such a fantastic movie that no one has heard of!
41809,I know.  Loved it. Haven't seen it since I seen it in the theater when it first came out but it's always one of those movies I tell people about still today.

41815,"If you're anything like me (these are all in my ""favorites"") you'll love most or all of them!"

Memento

Primer"
41817,Add Memento to this. Maybe Being John Malcovich and Adaptation?
41818,"Oh hmm. Being John Malkovich... That's an amazing movie. Definitely a head trip for the characters. Not sure it's a mind bending movie though. 

Memento, definitely. I originally didn't add it because it's mentioned by OP. I've since added it since people keep suggesting it."
41819,"Fair enough, didn’t read OPs point as Memento (typo threw me, didn’t register it).

Have you seen Adaptation? One of my favourite metanarrative films. 

Oh, and Stranger than Fiction is pretty good too."
41820,"I love both *Adaptation.* and *Stranger Than Fiction.* so much! (And I love that both of them are stylized with the period!)

Stranger Than Fiction is such a feel good movie for me. It always makes me smile and in a better mood."
41821,“I brought you flours” is one of my favourite lines. 😢
41822,"+1 for Moon, The Thirteenth Floor and Ex Machina. Those will seriously get you thinking.

As much as I enjoyed the eye candy in Ex Machina, I wish they hadn't sexualised it as much because a lot of people just either love or hate that part, focus on that and miss the main message.

Adding one to the list:

* Source Code

Not as mind blowing / applicable as the others, but none the less very interesting."
41823,The Game is one of my favourite movies. Watching it the 2nd time is almost better than the first.
41824,"Interstellar should be added to the not on Netflix category...Nolan directed it as well, and nothing will bend your mind like Interstellar"
41825,"I strongly disagree. Great movie, but not at all mind bending in my opinion. It seemed like a very straightforward story to me. 

Edit: then again, I felt the same way about Inception. Mind you I am a huge Nolan fan."
41826,">very straightforward

Did we watch the same movie?? It’s literally about the manipulation of space time from the 5th dimension...how in the mother of god does that not qualify as a mind bender?"
41827,"I'd add ""Arrival"" to the list as well. Language - nonlinear orthography as a means to understanding time as nonlinear and being able to see into the future."
41828,What you said sounded so much better than what I said
41829,"GREAT movie. One of my favorites. Ending is a bit of a head trip, but I don't personally feel like it was a mind fuck."
41830,I'd put it in the same category as Interstellar in that there were new concepts I had never thought of (probably more so). It's thought-provoking. Maybe not the exact definition of the main topic but similar
41833,Shutter island is on netflix
41834,Doesn't seem to be in the US.
41835,Prestige is on netflix
41836,"Either my Netflix is broken, or everyone who is telling me some of these movie are on Netflix are either in another country than the US, or aren't doing recent searches (remember things cycle out all the time).

Also, it seems Disney owned stuff is being pulled right now, in preparation for their new streaming service. 

Prestige is a Touchstone release, therefore under the Disney umbrella."
41837,"Not a movie but still a Netflix original - 

Dark

You'll definitely like it if you liked Donnie Darko"
41838,Dark was really excellent. One of my favourite series of last year for sure.
41839,"i really liked the song at the end of episode 9, and found it on youtube...

[Dan Deacon “When I Was Done Dying”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE)
 
and I thought it was a cool coincidence bc everything in Dark is based on a 33 year cycle, and theres a moment when the video shows [the number 33](https://i.imgur.com/cXJDpCV.png)...

for no apparent reason mind you, and its the only number you see in the entire video. 

but then the more I watched it the more I started to think that the entire show is actually inspired by this song and video, which predates their pitch to Netflix by 2 years. 

**NOTE: WHAT IM ABOUT TO WRITE IS MOSTLY WILD SPECULATION BUT THERE ARE SOME MILD SPOILERS AHEAD, SO TAP OUT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW** 

this doesn't even begin to cover everything, but the similarities literally start instantly, the very first thing you see or hear in the video and show is a rustling wind. after that both stories center around going into (and through) a cave, which sends you through time. 

at one point in the video he's returned back to now, but before that his face is ""wiped off"" and he says ""without ears I couldn't hear"", much like the kids with their eyes burned off and ear drums destroyed, and then it all ends with a massive explosion which essentially resets everything back to ""normal"". 

again, there's a lot more to it than what I listed here, its 3:17am on the west coast right now, I don't even know why Im awake and on here, but I think the producers actually wanted people to know this. 

if you just sorta mindlessly listen to the music, its pretty upbeat and fun imo, which does not fit the show AT ALL, especially not the scenes it was played over. its like they were practically begging people to notice it."
41840,You've just blown my mind with your crazy 3am trippy chat.
41841,"i mean, there has to be *something* to this, right? im not just getting messages from the TV again like when i shot President Reagan to impress Jodie Foster, am I?"
41842,"Not to rain on your parade but 33 has always had an occult meaning. Especially in Christianity - Jesus died at 33 for example. Many things appear in triplets as well - heaven, earth, hell. Past, present, future. And I guess in a Dan Brown novel 33 somehow leads to the meaning of life for what that's worth. 

<spoilers ahead>

That's not to say they weren't inspired by this song's lyrics somehow, even if it is about Dan Deacon tripping really hard. Writers can take influences from weird shit. Overall the show is heavily influenced by stuff like Twin Peaks and David Fincher but who knows how they thought up little details like missing ears. The whole dead birds thing for example reminded me of the game *Life is Strange* which is also heavily about time travel - going back in time causes much of the local wildlife to randomly drop dead just like in Dark. Whether they actually played the game or the dead animals thing is a reference to something else entirely I'm not sure though."
41843,"> Not to rain on your parade but 33 has always had an occult meaning. 

well, yeah, thats why i said it was just a cool coincidence. but that was just the start point. 

and just in case it wasn't clear, in no way am i implying that this is anything close to a plagiarism issue. i do suspect they took a few broad stroke ideas from it, but the fact that they then put the song in the show, for no apparent reason because it doesn't even fit, means (at least imo) that theyre not even pretending otherwise. they wanted people to know. 

and as you said, even that video feels influenced by [Malice in Wonderland](https://youtu.be/Lv8IezFbADc?t=36)

which Rick and Morty also [took from](https://youtu.be/TgqiSBxvdws?t=10)

and they seemingly went out of their way to copy it to a degree that you couldnt help but see the connection, as if they wanted no confusion as to where the idea came from"
41844,"AKA ""Hang on, which character is that? What year is this? Whose parents are they?"""
41845,Exactly!  I found myself walking a fine line by using the wikipedia episode summaries.  I wanted to ascertain exactly who I was watching without spoiling what they were going to do.  Still a great show.
41846,Well *I've* just added it to my watch list!
41848,"I put off watching this for a while just because it's in German and I worried I wouldn't catch all the subtitles since I'm usually doing other stuff while watching.

Turns out that even though I paid 100% attention, I still was confused for at least the first half of the series.  If you've seen it, you understand what I mean when I say it's hard to track who's who after a little while.

But ultimately, I loved it.  Sounds like Season 2 is going to be out next year. Can't wait."
41849,"Time Crimes (aka Los Chronocrimines)

Ignore the slightly crappy title and enjoy a brain-bending time travel movie that doesn't rely on special effects or fancy locations."
41850,Seconded... very good
41851,This isn't a movie but I definitely recommend Black Mirror as a TV show. Every single episode gives you that WTF IS GOING ON feeling like Inception
41852,"I can't get myself to watch Black Mirror.  It's so damn depressing.

I know there are a few feel good ones in there, but it makes me sad."
41853,San junipero and ~~kill~~ hang the dj are the least depressing.
41854,I know and I watched them but it still had a depressing mood about them as well.
41855,Hang the DJ. I correct you only because it’s a quote from a great 80’s song.
41856,Hell yes. VERY good show. Twilight Zone for the 21st century.
41857,"Highly Recommend:

- Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell (miniseries)
- Time Lapse"
41858,"Movies by Shane Carruth:
- Primer
- Upstream Color

Much smaller productions than Inception, but both are amazing. Fun fact, Shane Carruth not only directed these, but also produced, wrote, composed, and acted in them. The man is impressive."

41946,Mr Nobody 2009.
41947,"Dreamscape 
The dead zone"
41948,"Dark City, Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, Usual Suspects"
41949,+1 Dark City is incredible and very apt for a recommendation for movies like inception (those other recs are good watches as well if you have not seen them)
41950,"You want go crazy mind bender? How about time crimes
Primer
Mulholland drive
Memento
Triangle"
41951,"Gantz: O
The exam
La jetee probably isn't on Netflix but it's a short film and inspired 12 monkeys"
41952,"Visually, Dr Strange all the way. Can’t believe no one has suggested it..."
41953,"The Fountain
https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0414993/"
41956,Infinity chamber
41955,Dr Strange is pretty mind melty.
41957,"I dont know if these count. But I recently watched 2001: A Space Odysssey and 2010: First Contact.

Great to watch together IMO."
41958,"Otherlife. Low budget, not the best actors. But I liked the premise. Not Primer by any standards, but still good."
41959,"I also like the Discovery. Slow paced, better actors than Otherlife. And a real ambitious theme - What happens when you die."
41960,"Contact (1997, Jodie Foster)"
41961,Interstellar and Arrival both owe so much to Contact. really awesome movie.
41962,Interstellar and Contact are both Kip Thorne.
41963,"*Contact* is from Carl Sagan-he and Ann Druyan wrote it up a film treatment, but when it stalled up they made it a novel. It's a bummer that Sagan never got to see the film."
41964,“For Carl” get me every time. T.T
41965,Contact is by Sagan
41966,Thorne did help Sagan with the wormhole stuff.
41967,Obvious top post.  I remember seeing this in the cinema and feeling those uneasy chills as she approached the second gyrosphere which was on some secluded beachside on the other side of world.   What an incredible scene.   The tension as she gets in that pod and makes her final attempt is unreal.
41968,Incredible movie.  And once you've seen it definitely go read the book.
41969,"Sunshine. The first half is a true masterpiece. Still a great movie albeit a rough second half. This movie evokes so many emotions and tackles deep philosophical subjects while being fast paced, well acted, and unique."
41970,Garland said they'd written and filmed tons of dialogue for Pinbacker ranting about the Sun as he hunted them down. All that got cut in post. What might have been.....
41971,Not gonna lie. I still really liked the other half.
41972,Me too... it’s just that the first half is amazing. The Chris Evans (spoilers I guess) scene at the end to release the coolant is an all timer.
41973,I know the ending is stupid. I just love how creepy Mark Strong was. The fact they never showed him fully. I don’t know it just works for me.
41975,And Then The Prestige....Maybe Prestige first
41976,I felt pretty defeated by the end of memento

41978,"As much as I love the first two Cloverfield movies, The Cloverfield Paradox was one of the worst things I've ever seen."
41979,Drink every time you spot a plot hole. End up in hospital!
41981,"I Am Mother was pretty cool. Not the best, but it's like a discount Alex Garland movie. And the Mother character is exactly what the AI trope needed since Ex Machina."
41982,"Decent list. Blade Runner and Annihilation are in my top ten. Looper, and Shutter Island are pretty overrated. The cloverfield paradox is literally one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen."
41983,"This is the beauty of movies. Different people will have different opinions. I personally think Looper and Shutter Island are amazing, probably top 50, while Blade Runner and Annihilation bores me."
41984,"- The Fountain
- Oblivion
- Contact
- Gattaca"
41985,"I was scrolling through to see if anyone mentioned ""The Fountain."" I'll second it of course. I'd also throw in Ender's Game."
41986,"Ender’s Game the book?

Surely you can’t mean the movie"
41987,"Been planning on reading the book for like the last 2 years, but yes I meant the movie, I'm sure the book goes much deeper than the film ever could though."
41988,"I mean... the movie trashed the book; which is perhaps one of the greatest pieces of sci-fi ever written. The sequel “Speaker for the Dead” is another contender 

It’s a fast/easy read; or 8 hours book on tape. Give it a go you have some time"
41989,"The sequels are significantly deeper IMO and well worth a read, the author pretty much wrote Ender's game to introduce the character of Ender so he could use him in the sequels."
41990,"Ummm sort of? Enders Game started as a short story, which the author later expanded into a novel, partially because he wanted to do things with Ender's family that he didn't in the short story, partially to set up and expand on the speaker for the dead concept, and partly because he does that sometimes.  Ender himself is of minimal importance in the sequels. The story requires a human speaker for the dead, which doesn't need to be Ender, but instead could have been anyone to took up that pseudo-faith following the end of Enders Game."
41991,"From wikipedia:

>In a commentary track for the 20th Anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author's Definitive Edition, Card stated that Ender's Game was written specifically to establish the character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in Speaker for the Dead, the outline for which he had written before novelizing Ender's Game."
41992,"Oh, that's not a bad one either."
41993,[The Signal 2014](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910814/)
41994,This was a under appreciated little flick. Knowing almost nothing about it going in I definitely enjoyed. Not a masterpiece but definitely worthwhile.
41995,"I viewed the movie in exactly the same way!
 
Very impressed with the story and special effects; I loved the overall concept and I was shocked to see a low IMDB score. The trailer showed a bit too much and I understand if people mistook this movie as something else.
 
This also reminds me of two other films where the trailers try their damnedest to ruin the movie:
 
[Midnight Special, 2016](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2649554)
 
[Captive State, 2019](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968394/)"
41996,"I loved this one! Checked it out because of Lawrence Fishburne, as he’s just always great. Ended up being really impressed by everyone involved!"
41997,"I am surprised that this movie does not get more attention especially with the strength of the acting and special effects.
 
The ending has spoiled me on other *""edgy""* sci-fi stories (The remake of Twilight Zone for instance)."
41998,"I’d like to take this moment to say that The Signal 2007 is also really interesting.  This is not what the OP is looking for at all, but I just don’t get opportunities to talk about that movie."
41999,"> [The Signal 2007](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780607/)
 
I also enjoyed this movie! the technology infection concept always intrigued me and I believe this movie is the best in the genre. [Especially compared to [Cell, 2016](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775440/)]
 
Have you seen [Pontypool, 2008](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/)?

Edit: mixed up the date of Pontypool"
42000,"Nope, but I'll have to check it out.  Thanks!"

42004,YES! This film needs mentioned more.
42005,"It's my faouvrite movie, I must have watched it three times."
42006,I was going to say this and the newer Netflix one called I am Mother
42007,"The Prestige, Fight Club, Memento, Se7en"
42008,"Enemy (2015, Jake Gyllenhaal)"
42009,"Enemy is incredible, Anything by Denis Villeneuve is incredible tbh"
42011,Dark City! Classic. Way too underrated
42012,"You really cannot go wrong with any of Chris Nolans films. They arent all as deep as inception, but the worst he's ever done is Dark Knight Rises and that's a pretty entertaining movie, so literally anything from his filmography is a good starting point. Also check out Denis Villeneuve (he directed arrival), his films like Prisoners, Sicario, and especially Enemy will probably fit the bill of what you're looking for."

42016,Movie was incredible. Easily my favorite from last year. Nothing else I’ve seen recently is quite like it.
42017,"I don’t have a problem with the all female casts reboots of other popular movies. But I’m a little bummed that this original sci-fi movie with an almost all female cast that is AMAZING got so swept under the rug. 
I try to tell everyone I can to watch this."
42018,Funny you say that. One of my coworkers watched in on a flight and fucking loathes it.

42022,Is that the monster movie in space?
42023,No. It’s a hard sci-fi movie about an expedition to Europa one of Jupiter’s moons.
42024,You're probably thinking of Life with Ryan Reynolds
42025,Nah. Didnt  see that one. It was with some squid monster under the ice or something lame like that.
42026,"Under the ice? The Thing from 1982? Doesn't look like a squid tho, but I can't remember anything else close to your description."
42027,"> The first two are made by Christopher Nolan, and I haven’t seen his other movies. 

I think you know the answer"
42028,"> Movies like Arrival

May I interest you in *Close Encounters with the Third Kind*?"
42029,"Memento - The Christopher Nolan movie that put him on the map.

The Prestige - Inception and The Dark Knight are probably better movies, but this is definitely Nolan’s most mind-bending film for me. Jackman and Bale kill it. Will reel you in from moment one.

Fight Club - My 2nd favorite movie of all time. Very weird and perplexing. Whatever people’s thoughts are on Tyler Durden’s philosophy, there’s no denying that it’s super interesting. It has one of the best last 20 minutes of all time.

The Sixth Sense - A great psychological thriller with a dash of horror, if you for some reason haven’t gotten this movie spoiled or don’t know anything about it, watch it ASAP."

Edit: How has only one other person brought this movie up?"

42033,OP is already aware of Nolan.
42034,"> The first two are made by Christopher Nolan, and I haven’t seen his other movies."
42035,Which means they already know he's made other movies that they can check out. We don't need to tell them.
42036,Don't tell me way down here at the bottom. Find some courage and tell the person with the memento comment at the top.
42037,I'm telling you because you asked.
42039,Didn't sound rhetorical to me. I thought you were really wondering why people didn't mention it.
42040,I guess we need to start adding /r
42041,"Predestination. Based on the Robert A. Heinlein short story (and really sticks to it), directed by the Spierig Brothers and starring Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook. Mayor mindfuck. Highly recommended."

42047,I fucking love that movie
42048,"Gattaca - I wouldn't necessarily call it a mind-twister, but I do think it's a gorgeous (almost austere looking) piece of sci-fi that's really well done with strong performances from Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman."
42049,"If you like the deep cuts, I'd reiterate Contact, like others have said. I'd also add Gattaca (1997)"

Still waiting for Soderberghs to be released in 4k. Haven't seen Tarkovsky's (yet).

Still listening to Cliff Martinez's score almost 20 years later... Fuck me... I was 14 when that movie came out...   


Yeet."
42052,"It's a link to the 1972 listing on IMDB. (Maybe that doesn't show up in whatever way yer viewing the comment)

Didn't care for the Soderbergh version, but I probably will watch it again at some point."
