On a serious note, I'd say either [Grand Illusions](http://www.youtube.com/user/henders007), which has some really cool things, or [NBF](http://www.youtube.com/user/henders007), which is kinda stupid but really fun."

18875,Kyle Mooney is so great.  I was so happy to see him land a gig on SNL and still be able to do this kind of comedy.
18877,"I have considered ASMR to be somewhat of a strange phenomenon. From what I've seen earlier it was just cute girls with a soothing voice shaking and scratching random objects making it seem like a strange fetish to me, but this video right here makes me understand the appeal. They put a lot of effort into this one to really make it feel like you're submerged in a kind of futuristic world. Thanks for posting this."
18878,">They put a lot of effort into this one to really make it feel like you're submerged in a kind of futuristic world. Thanks for posting this.

That's not asmr in itself though. Asmr is triggered by sound or visuals. It has nothing to do with being submerged in anything or cute girls infront of a video camera, although it can help for some. The personal attention you get from such videos can also be very relaxing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjhTbePvyXc is a good example of a random video being triggering."
18879,That is an unbelievably cool video
18880,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHK__BafDmU

18910,"Just in case anybody wants to know, the title and the video are a German pun. ""Mischbrot"" is a type of bread made from mixed grains (it literally means 'mix-bread').

Also, in German, 'mixing' and 'shuffling' is the same word. So 'Mischbrot' can mean 'bread made from mixed grains' or 'shuffle-bread'."

18945,I love watching Kitboga mess up scammers. I read once that he was the only Twitch streamer that had to have security at Twitchcon. I think it’s cool when he enlists other streamers to help lol

18954,The recent mario kart 64 world record video was truly well done. What a dramatic story!
18955,That shit broke my heart lol. I wanted him to get that 32/32 so badly.
18956,The quality of his videos is blowing me away. The new mario kart video is better than a lot of professional documentaries that I've seen. Just gripping. And I don't care about speed running really at all otherwise.

18972,"He is, he's busy with school"

18997,Just watched the DB Cooper video. Awesome channel!!

19005,"He said in a Q&A video (the 3mil subscribers one I think) that he isn’t opposed to doing more top 10 style videos, but that he’s just enjoying the documentary style ones more for now. If he decides to do a topic that fits better as top 10, I don’t think he’d hesitate though."

19021,"The comment section is golden. I really like all the comments relating to either being so good at lock picking he just has to look at it, or the ones about him breaking into your house and hearing” 1 is binding, click out of two, ...”"
19022,I agree. Good to see when people send him locks and he spends more time ripping the packaging off then actually picking the lock.
19023,"That was gonna be my suggestion aswell.

It is fascinating how lost you can get in watching some dude narrating while he's picking locks."

19037,Add Tom Scott to your general explanation list.
19038,"I’d add Kyle Hill to the science list, he was the host of Because Science before he left in this year."
19039,"Smarter Every Day should be part of your science channel list

Other than that some really great recommendations!!!"

I have lost count of how many hours i have spent just watching Julian restore old paintings. It is so incredibly satisfyingly to watch a damaged art piece slowly coming together. The comments tend to be hilarious too."

19389,Tom Scott

A close second is CGP Grey.

Edit: corrected to CGP Grey.  Thanks u/idot-man"
19048,His game shows don't seem to get a lot of views but they're pretty well thought out games with interesting questions.
19049,"If you don't mind a darker sense of humor, Michael Reeves."
19050,"Absolutely. Sadly he doesn't have a ton of content, and posts very rarely. Then again, to get to a level of memery of science that he has, it must take a whole long time."
19051,"It is sad that its pretty rare, but it is always great when he does. He clearly takes his time with his videos to make sure they're done right. 

He does have a twitch, though from what I've heard, its a lot of minecraft and not the mad scientist stuff."
19052,"Drew Gooden, dudes got hours of hilarious content."
19053,That’s actually his second channel! His original is called Danny Gonzalez
19054,"Don't forget about the third channel, Kurtis Conner."

19058,Jim Browning is the closest thing we have to a real life super hero
19059,I was looking for code bullet baby
19060,Soviet womble
19061,Soviets bullshittery videos stand a notch above any other gameplay comedy I've seen
19062,and theres *so many*
19063,His use of subtitles is probably the best in youtube gaming
19064,"""You cannot have the call sign 'GAS CHAMBER'"""
19065,"I practically die every time Nevil shows up. I still remember I had to pause the video at one point I was laughing so hard when ""he even TYPES in broken english"""

19077,"Ive been watching for around for around 18 months and just recently finished the first campaign and started campaign 2, there's just so much content"
19078,"Some of my favorite channels that I can get lost in for hours, that aren't the ""big"" channels with subscriber counts measured in the millions, but smaller, usually more niche, but still very entertaining channels with smaller subscriber bases.

[Z Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XdYJjWliOdKuZMNaTiP8Q) \- Reviews of all sorts of audio gear, speakers, and headphones.  His presentation style and often colorful language make it supremely entertaining.

[Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uKrU_WqJ1R2HMTY3LIx5Q) \- Space, science, and everything you could possibly ever want to know about rockets.  Live launch coverage.

[Scott Manley](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg) \- Also space, science, and rockets.  He's got over a million subs, so kind of already popular.

[Junkball](https://www.youtube.com/c/JunkBallMedia/featured) \- All things sci-fi, with an emphasis on the Star Trek Universe.

[Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechnologyConnections/featured) \- Great in depth explorations of quirky technologies.

[Spacedock](https://www.youtube.com/c/Spacedock/featured) \- Another sci-fi channel with great breakdowns of in-universe tech for many sci-fi franchises.

[Isaac Arthur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g) \- Science and Futurism videos.  If you like Kurzgesagt, you'll like this.

[CinemaWins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8h3ri2WN_-IbviBlWtUcQ) \- CinemaSins, but in reverse.

[MAKE. ART. NOW.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRE4gvdeDkwf1oJrsabWWQ) \- Great channel for video and photo creatives.

[Gerald Undone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC09qASY4ixFS-KXIH6Nw0rg) \- Another great channel for photo and video creatives, with an emphasis on in depth equipment reviews and concept explanations.

[OverSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/user/Webzwithaz) \- Cheating here, since it is a pretty big channel with 4 million subs, but it's soo fantastic.  Absolutely amazing 20-40 min overview videos of major events and conflicts throughout history.

[Company Man](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQMyhrt92_8XM0KgZH6VnRg) \- The history and rise (and fall) of various companies.

[Mike Olbinski](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikeOlbinski/featured) \- Absolutely jaw dropping time lapse videos of various weather phenomenon. Just do yourself a favor and watch them all.

[RegularCars](https://www.youtube.com/user/RegularCars) \- Automotive reviews with a big helping of witty social commentary.

[savagegeese](https://www.youtube.com/user/savagegeese) \- Another very good automotive channel.

[TheStraightPipes](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheStraightPipes) \- Rounds out my trio of favorite automotive channels.

[Epic Light Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/EpicLightMedia/featured) \- Great practical photography/videography/lighting tutorials.

19091,Watching Fubuki's gambling addiction puts a smile on my face
19092,"If you like horror movies, Dead Meat. 

If you just like movies, Screen Rant’s Pitch Meetings. 

If you’re a guitar player, JHS Pedals. 

If you like philosophy or have a sociology degree, Wisecrack.

19099,With a *TITLE CAAAARD*
19100,Words you can hear
19101,"Pitch Meeting is so great, makes me stay subbed to the channel despite literally every other piece of media on there is pure stinking garbage. Really is one of the worst channels out there, just so intrusively stupid and so clickbaity they must think every watcher is a slobbering moron. 

Would be great if he got to move it all over to his own channel, which also has some neat stuff, but I guess they've got a contract he can't easily break."
19102,"Ah Ryan George's Pitch Meetings, the guy has such a great sense of humor. I'd also recommend those"
19103,They're super easy to watch. Barely an inconvenience.

19108,"All of the hermits on hermitcraft

Blameitonjorge

Whang"
19109,"LGR for his Thrift videos, his reviews of The Sims series and many other older games.  He also covers neat old tech and computer accessories.

LGR foods is also great."
19110,"Bald and Bankrupt is my personal favorite. He's a travel blogger that goes to areas that tourists particularly don't travel to - like former Soviet countries. He has a knack for hitting it off with locals, and he also loves traveling to old, forgotten soviet towns."
19111,"I like how in one city he heard gunshots and proceeded to run towards them out of curiosity. He’s also toured a South American ghetto, in suit and tie, alone, all while the locals are in the background telling him he’s gonna get killed. Dude’s got some serious balls"
19112,And half of the commentary is the word Soviet
19113,A lovely soviet sink
19114,RedLetterMedia
19115,I love red letter media. Every now and then I re-benge re:view or best of the worst. A good way to waste away a good 12 to 36 hours
19116,You mean you dont keep BotW constantly running in the background?
19117,"A Rich Evans laughing spree tends to interrupt whatever I might be doing. Also, I get lost in Mike’s soulful, dead eyes way too easily."
19118,"[Shiey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXwMqnXfJzazKS5fJ8nrVw) has no ads, clickbait, sponsored posts, and the vibe of his content is amazing. He mostly does train surfing, exploring abandoned military locations, and stuff like that. Each video is like a journal."
19119,Internet comment etiquette with erik
19121,Not many people can make an ad that is 3+ minutes long and be one of the most entertaining parts of the video.
19122,One can indeed bounce on their boy's dick for hours to it.
19123,Scott The Woz
19124,NakeyJakey is pretty good

19131,"Russian dash cam videos. They're both terrifying and hilarious.
It's like in Russia driver's ed consists of 2 hours of Grand Theft Auto and a bottle of vodka. 
Apologies to safe and considerate Russian drivers. I don't mean you.
P. S. Learn to tighten a freaking lug nut, will ya."
19132,Mark Rober...seriously check it out.
19133,"If you enjoy relatively long essay videos about film, Lindsay Ellis and Breadsword. 

The latter doesn't have so many videos out, they don't upload too often, but the ones they have are very good. Not the most commanding voice, but they clearly are very passionate about the subject matter, I particularly recommend their videos on Treasure Planet and, Dr Strangelove.

Lindsay Ellis did a whole series of videos on queer film theory among other subjects, using the Michael Bay Transformers films as the study, as well as a very good three part series on The Hobbit trilogy, a dissection of GoT season 8 and (assuming it hasn't been taken down, not sure) a funny examination of 'Dadaist masterpiece' Freddie Got Fingered."
19134,Oh my god the omegaverse scandal has been wild. I've watched a lot of her critiques of musicals turned movies so I flipped that one on thinking ya know what could this be.... bat shit crazy bonkers people
19135,"Chris flemings: gayle series is very rewatchable

*picture of utterly destroyed car*"
19157,"With an accident like that, it is possible he doesn't remember.  Good on Facebook to helpfully remind him."
19158,This one does it for me. I really love AI causing accidental humor. Is there a subreddit for that?
