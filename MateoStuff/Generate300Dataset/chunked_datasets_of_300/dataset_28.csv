9061,You read his pizza? I usually eat mine.

9064,I don't have you tagged because AlienBlue lacks that feature :<
9065,"I never flossed. Until I bought [this wonderful device.](https://www.google.com/search?q=waterpik+flosser&hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1C1AVSW_enUS373US373&prmd=imvns&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=w9WTT6qZAtPE2QXx2JGfBQ&ved=0COABEK0E) Now I don't feel guilty about not flossing. Spray water around your mouth for 30 seconds? Piece of cake.

Edit: Also I have a permanent retainer and it's a lifesaver in that regard as well."
9066,"I was given one of those as a present. It's awful and doesn't work at all. I did a test where I used it on my whole mouth twice over, then broke out the floss... There was still a ton of gross stuff stuck between my teeth that only the floss could reach. If it could leave that much behind, it's clearly ineffective which is a shame because I had high hopes for it. Plus there's a lot of gross blowback from it :( I would not recommend it to anyone who is serious about keeping their teeth in good shape."
9067,oh god I love my waterpik.
9068,Waterpik is dutch for 'water dick'. Do you really want to poke around your mouth with that?
9069,"[I'm not saying yes, but...](http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t267/jdmt37/1239704331_gina-carano.gif)"
9070,Faptastic
9071,Why a soft bristled toothbrush? Is firm too harsh?
9072,I believe firm bristles are too rough on your gums.
9073,"Plus if you brush too vigorously with a firm brush you can actually wear down your enamel, I had a dentist switch me to a softer brush for that reason."
9074,Then why do they even make the firm brushes?
9075,"My gums like it rough. I'm ok with that, it's the leather chaps that bother me."
9076,"Dental student here, generally its recommended for people to use soft bristles because its not only softer for the gums, but more so to avoid damage to the layer of enamel on teeth. 

You should look up ""Abrasion cavities"" on Google and check out the images. That sort of damage is exacerbated using a hard bristled-toothbrush."
9077,[Something tells me you got the memo.](http://i.imgur.com/dSsuc.png)
9078,"Thanks for the info! So, does the ""whitening"" toothpaste actually do anything?"
9080,"I hate flossing my teeth and gums, how close are they to using stem cells to regrow teeth?"
9081,"[Those are amazing!](http://i.imgur.com/929U5.jpg) It is so much faster, easier and cleaner to floss with them and they are quite cheap too! Not cheaper than regular floss but hell, you will use them at least! Sold at every drug store, wall*mart and so on nowadays for 3$ a 100pack."
9082,"From personal experience, I gotta admit, what comes out to maybe 20 seconds of circular hand-motion beats fucking around with a string."
9083,Not just good advice for flossing...
9085,"The brand I use (Plackers) doesn't have this problem, and I go out of my way to find it. I think there's kevlar in the floss part."
9086,"There are like 20 brands out there, some even like I said are a ""band"" not even floss. Some are re-usable, you just change the roll of floss so the handle is a lot sturdier than the disposable version. Shop around a bit! Or eat celery after each meal, whatever!"
9087,"Coincidentally I saw a dental hygienist just this week, and she said that these are ok, but traditional dental floss is better because it's thicker. Whether that's fact or just her opinion I couldn't say. (I use the ones in your picture too)"
9088,"I currently use a phillips electric brush that vibrates, is this more effective than my traditional manual brush?  What brushing techniques do you suggest?"
9090,"This is 100% anecdotal and coming from someone whose teeth have always been in good shape (no cavities). But I also hate flossing, and never have, just put up with my dentist yelling at me for not doing it every time I go for my cleaning. However ever since I started using a Sonicare I got for Xmas 2 years ago, my dentist now congratulates me for my newfound dedication to flossing. Ha!"
9091,my dentist recommended a sonicare because i was brushing too hard with a regular brush. it does make my teeth feel extra squeaky clean! plus i love that it times my toothbrushing for me.
9092,">Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.

Holy shit. Are you serious? My parents programmed me to go for 5 minutes. I thank them.

Edit: by programmed I mean they had a 2.5 minute sand timer and I had to brush for the length of the timer on tops and then flip the timer over for bottoms. After years, I didn't really need the timer and by muscle memory it just felt ""right"" after so long. It stills feels odd if I have to rush and don't brush long enough."
9093,You should probably cut that down to 2 minutes total. I've worn down my gums from brushing too hard and/or too long.
9094,"So how should I brush my teeth? I brush around the 5 minutes, but the dentists keep bitchen about me not brushing good enough."
9095,are you using a tooth brush or a hair brush?
9096,"Not a dentist, but was recently told this by mine:

It's not only about how long you brush your teeth, but also how. She told me the brush should be angled to touch the top of the gums as well as the bottom of your teeth. Also to brush in circular motions if you're using a traditional toothbrush (as opposed to an electric one). What else... also to brush behind your teeth by angling the brush."
9097,I've read that brushing without toothpaste actually removes substantially more plaque. Do you suggest toothpaste for the fluoride itself?
9098,"Floss, then brush or brush, then floss? Or iterate?"
9099,"My dentist recommended flossing first, then brushing. She said that the floss loosens up gunk which your toothbrush then removes."
9100,Are there any adverse effects from *only* using a toothpaste like sensodyne?
9101,It doesn't have to be fluoride based though? i'm just asking because I use a baking soda based toothpaste and my teeth have improved and plaque has been reduced.
9102,fluoride is a poison ><
9103,"My mom has been a dental hygienist for over three decades, and she told me they're pretty much all the same (provided they contain fluoride). One exception is if you have sensitivity- then you should use Sensodyne."
9104,"Not a dentist, or related to anyone in dentistry, but as a person with very sensitive teeth, I was skeptical of Sensodyne. Not anymore. It works. Use it."
9105,"I remember when I was in high school, there was this stupid kid who told everyone he rubbed sensodyne on his penis before he got ""blowjobs"" from his ""girlfriend"" because it made his penis more sensitive, thereby making his ""blowjobs"" feel better.  I shit you not."
9106,"I believe it. It was high school. We all did, said and tried stupid things, just remember it's not his fault you're missing out on some Sensodynamite blow jobs."
9107,Upvote for Sensodynamite
9109,Really? Because I feel like my sensitivity got worse after I started using it. I don't know....maybe I just got lazy when brushing..
9110,You didn't buy the whitening kind did you? Because someone I know was told by her dentist that the whitening ingredients weaken the enamel. Why they would put those things into a toothpaste intended to strengthen enamel beats me.
9111,"no I just bought regular. I think my mind was like ""oh it will make my teeth less sensitive, so I don't have to brush as long (??)"". My mind is stupid."
9112,"Oh my god Sensodyne. One night I fell asleep with a pair of those teeth whitening strips on for a few hours. The pain the next morning was indescribable.  

You know that feeling of pain you get when you bite into a huge scoop of ice cream? That horrible cold, electric discomfort? Amp that up by 10. I couldn't talk because when I would suck in a breath the pain intensified. I was pretty much in tears at work.

I took a co worker's advice and got Sensodyne and was basically brushing my teeth every 30 minutes. and spitting into a trashcan by my desk.

 It temporarily took away the pain. It was amazing."
9113,Oh sweet baby Jesus...I have done the same thing. It was like every nerve in every tooth was exposed at the same time. I could not even talk because the air hitting my raw teeth made me want to cry. My dentist told me to rinse with flouride rinse and I got many strange looks from the people in the grocery store when I tore open the flouride seal and started swishing and whimpering in the check-out line.
9114,"I was an intern at a telecommunications company.

I basically got to lay my head down on my desk all day and the mother hen of the office kept everyone away from me. 

I would have rather ran payroll and expense reports."
9115,"My mom always bought sensodyne for the last couple years I lived at home, but I noticed my breath would just start getting awful like halfway through the day and my mouth didn't really feel super clean to begin with. I couldn't do it. I much prefer the stupidly minty, breath-annihilating toothpastes."
9116,why the fuck have i been reading about toothpaste for half an hour at 3 am?... good night reddit.
9117,"Well, you wont forget to brush your teeth before you go to bed."
9118,"Holy crap, thank you for being my voice of reason, you flipped me out of my toothpaste trance, Iv'e even been getting closer to the computer to read this shit."
9119,Most toothpaste brands are recommended by 4 out of 5 dentists.  That fifth one holds the secret.
9121,The fifth one knows he profits by not endorsing good teeth care products.
9122,The fifth one is high on Fentanyl and nitrous.
9124,AMA Request: the fifth dentist.
9125,The fifth one *also* recommended it because all 5 are employed by the toothpaste company.  But it's still technically legal (and less suspicious) to say 4 out of 5 recommended it.
9126,"what about when it is 9/10 dentists recommend it? is the fifth one just saying ""ehhhh.... its okay""?"
9127,TIL there are no Dentists on reddit
9128,"There was a post asking a Dentist's opinion on something... oh, it was about teeth whitening. Later, like 2 months later, I found the thread again because I needed to read what the dentist wrote in his response. Guess what? His post and his entire username was deleted. 

Dental Conspiracy? Think about it."
9129,Or maybe reddit is run by a bunch of anti-dentites

9137,"That must be why all Dentists are depressed, they don't have time to be on reddit!"
9138,"I am not a dentist, but I have something to say about toothpaste.

APPARENTLY, if you suffer from canker sores, there's something in almost all toothpastes (but not all) that makes them waaaay more likely to occur. It's not even an active ingredient, it's [just the stuff that makes it foamy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lauryl_sulfate#Aphthous_ulcers).

*Why did no one tell me this shit before??*"
9139,"I currently have 3 canker sores. They're such a bitch. I really need to switch toothpastes and see if that helps.

Edit: Thanks for all your suggestions, I'll definitely check them out."
9140,use arm and hammer. works really well
9141,"Fun fact: The guy who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network is named Armand Hammer. Real name. Comes from a long line of Armand Hammers, the first of which was actually named after the American Socialist Labor party's arm and hammer symbol."
9142,I don't think an arm and a hammer are good things to use to clean teeth
9143,That's the trick. Use a hammer and you'll never have to clean them again.
9144,Arm and Hammer has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it. That would be a terrible thing for him to switch to.
9145,"I've read that baking soda promotes healing, and I've tried it myself to positive results.  Usually I just dump some baking soda right on there, maybe mixed with some water.  Pretty painful, but it makes the canker sore go away after a day or two.  I guess the question is whether the preventative/healing benefits of having baking soda in the toothpaste outweighs the harm of the sodium lauryl sulfate."
9146,My dad has used Arm and Hammer for as long as I can remember and it's all I've ever used.
9147,"**How to fix canker sores**: Using mouthwash a few times a day not only numbs the pain, but it disinfects the sores so they heal faster. 

**Warning:** this can be quite painful while you have the mouthwash in but go for the whole 30 seconds anyways. Once you spit it out the pain will be gone. 

**Pro-tip:** In a pinch, vodka works almost as well as mouthwash."
9148,">vodka works almost as well as mouthwash.

hmm. I wonder if that's why I've never had a canker sore...?"
9149,"what I normally do when I have canker sores is to dab a salt on them. It will burn like a bitch for a few minutes, but then you'd be so numb to it and it helps it heal faster."
9150,"Sensodine helped me with these. They hurt like a bitch, sorry you have 3."
9151,"I've suffered from horrible canker sores my whole life. I've also suffered from IBS as well. It was about 5 years ago I was prescribed a medication to treat the IBS, something called hyoscyamine. I take it twice a day every day. I now only get a canker sore if I miss taking the medication for a week or so.  I've actually gone a couple of years without getting one but then I get lazy about refiling the medication and one will start to form. This shit is a miracle drug and I've always wanted to tell people about it because canker sores are the worst."
9152,"This is how I feel about Milk of Magnesia.

For those who don't know, Milk of Magnesia is a white, chalky liquid that comes in a blue bottle that you're supposed to drink as a laxative. But if you rub it on your face, it gets rid of your acne. When NOTHING ELSE WILL.

When I was in high school, I had terrible, stubborn acne, and no amount of prescription drugs or proactiv worked. I tried everything and it was so frustrating. Then my mom saw somewhere on line that Milk of Magnesia helps if you rub it on your face.

It worked like a dream. In like two weeks my acne was gone. I would suggest acne-ridden Redditors to try it out.

Sidenote: DO NOT rub the cherry-flavored MOM on your face. The sugar will just make you break out more. PLAIN ONLY."
9153,"Thank you for this.

Switching from my whitening toothpaste seriously decreased the number of canker sores I developed (which was A LOT), but I hadn't a clue what to look for in toothpastes to prevent it."
9154,"I've had them for years, I can back this up. I switched to a toothpaste without SLS and they're MUCH smaller, less painful, and I get them much more infrequently."
9155,What toothpaste should I use then?
9156,"Question: ""Dentist of Reddit please tell me.....""
Answer: (Every man woman and child with a keyboard)""I got this"""
9158,upvote for Colgate Total. Some time I did a bit of reading rounding around on the net and Colgate came out best.
9159,Should be noted that Colgate total with triclosan is slightly better but may disrupt ecosystems as it is an antibacterial. Most important is brush technique.
9160,"I'm actually a dentist.  My personal recommendation as well as what I always use at home is Colgate Total.  Behoove was correct in that it contains Triclosan, which is an antibacterial agent. Colgate currently has a patent on it in toothpaste form.

There was a time when Colgate Total's FDA approval was still pending in the US, and dentists would drive across the border to Canada to bring back this toothpaste. Really.

I get inundated with samples of Crest Pro-Health.  I'll buy the Colgate instead.

On the other hand, the best toothpaste is the one you'll use most!  If its disgusting, or makes you feel like the first layer of skin cells on your cheeks  are sloughing off, you won't use it, therefore it won't work as well.

Hope that helps...."
9161,"I asked this above, but doesn't the constant use of an antibiotic increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria in your mouth (and digestive system)?"
9162,"Yes,it does. You shouldn't unnecessarily expose yourself to antibiotics or antibacterial agents like Triclosan. If you want to kill the bacteria in your mouth, use a mouthwash like Listerine. 

Additionally, you don't need to use antibacterial soap when washing your hands. Plain soap and warm water for 25 seconds is enough to remove most pathogens. 

Source: I'm a 4th year PhD student researching infectious disease control"
9163,"and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the scrubbing action/friction that removes pathogens when you wash your hands isn't it, not so much the use of soap?"
9165,"Some types of antibacterials, you don't need to worry about so much about resistant strains developing, because the mechanism of action. Soap, for example."
9166,What about the thyroid triclosan link? or its reaction with chlorine in water? would you say those are negligable in toothpaste?
9167,This man is not a dentist.  This man is a Colgate shill.  Do not listen.
9168,I met a guy who thought toothpaste was a dental conspiracy and gave you more cavities. So he brushes his teeth with regular soap. Must taste pretty bad
9170,I am so *disappointed* in reddit right now.
9171,"Redditor's logic: Make fun of Kesha and her lack of talent, know the lyrics to her song.

9184,"REDDIT, YOU HAVE CONVINCED ME TO START FLOSSING. IF ANYBODY READS THIS AND CARES, MESSAGE ME IN A MONTH AND SEE IF IM STILL FLOSSING. NAGGING IS ALLOWED AT THAT POINT."
9185,Is any one else hoping that 4 dentist agree on one and a fifth disagrees
9186,"What's the opinon on natural toothpaste like [Tom's](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/76304/300.jpg)?

Now I know what everyone's thinking but I have zero inclination towards things simply because of a ""natural"" or ""organic label; but regular toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling like it's been violated. I can't stop tonguing my teeth after and everything tastes like crap for the next hour or so."
9187,"I use Tom's. I think it tastes pretty good, or how good you think toothpaste can be. No burn and a good feeling that it's fluoride free."
9188,"I switched to Tom's a few years ago and really like the difference. None of that aftertaste, and I brush longer."
9189,Let's face it... I'm simply not going to floss twice a day. Should I floss in the morning or at night?
9190,"I will be a dental student in a few months and have spent hundreds of hours shadowing. What I have learned is..
1. Toothpaste that is ""whitening"" is actually worse for you than normal toothpaste because it contains abrasive material that is actually destroying stained enamel.
2. Studies are showing that mouthwash may not be as beneficial as once thought because it increases the pH in the mouth, therefore promoting bacterial growth."
9192,They've all killed themselves
9193,"I'm in dental hygiene school... And I use kids Colgate because adult toothpaste is too spicy for me. Plus, it's got transformers on it and transformers make everything more exciting. I also have a children's darth vader electric toothbrush.... As for flossing, I hated doing it but then I started keeping floss in my car. I floss stopped in traffic, red lights. Now I floss every day."
9194,...spicy? &#3232;\_&#3232;
45888,Floss.
9196,I had a dentist tell me that it would be better to floss twice a day and stop brushing then to brush twice a day and not floss.
9197,"I actually went 15 years without seeing a dentist, and only had one small faint cavity when I did finally see a dentist. 

Here's what I did: 

1) Floss 2 to 3 times per day. (Keep a bottle of floss at my desk, in the shower, etc...) 

2) Each time I eat, or drink something with sugar, I swish water around in my mouth, and swallow it. (This washes away the sugar, since sugar  fuels bacteria that causes tooth decay.) 

3) Swish my mouth with a good flouride based mouth wash (recommend Oral-B) once or twice per day.

4) Brush once per day. (Yup, I don't actually brush twice per day.... although I suspect I probably should.) 

5) Once per week swish my mouth with peroxide to kill bacteria. 

6) Change my tooth brush once per month. (I buy the big pack at Costco. Medium hardness.) 

PS: Most of the time I've been using that baking soda whitening tooth paste (triple strength). But I worry that it might, after all these years, wear away my tooth enamel. But so far so good... for now.

PPS: I've decided to make sure I see a dentist at least once per year, from now on. 

PPPS: Interesting tip: if you want to know if you have bad breath, or not, floss, and then smell the floss. And then you will know."
9198,"Arm & Hammer toothpaste with peroxide and baking soda is the best toothpaste...well not necessarily, but if your toothpaste does not have peroxide in it you should do something about it!"
9199,"I barely ever brush. Maybe once a week since I was 10 (I'm 20), had one cavity and great teeth otherwise and I never had braces whilst everyone in my family has them. Can someone explain this."
9200,"On behalf of myself and all the other crappy-teethed individuals in the world, fuck you very much. :("
9201,"Same here. My wife used to be that way, until I kept reminding her how lucky she is to have such great teeth. She's a lot better with it now, but it really irked me."

9203,"poor oral hygiene is bad for your heart, too"
9204,"Apart from all the external factors, some people are just more likely to get cavities than others, just like some are more prone to cancer. That doesn't make you clinical study case or superhuman. So, congratulations on not getting cavities and not dying of leukemia when you were 10.

9206,Genetics giveth and genetics taketh away.
9207,"Some people are simply born with mouths that start less acidic than most, and that return to a non-acidic pH faster after eating. In addition, the bacteria in people's mouths are different, so you might be less prone to cavities than most in the first place.

Basically, your mouth is just a genetically healthy mouth. There are some people who brush 4 times a day, look at a cupcake, and get 5 cavities."

9221,*insert cringe 2010 reference nobody remembers*
9222,"1 for Colgate optic white
1 for Crest gum detoxify

Just need 8 more for either one and we have the winner"
9223,"My dentist didn’t recommend it, but he has Crest Gum Detoxify all over the office so I bought some. It’s pretty expensive compared to other toothpaste and I have no idea if it works (my teeth got better after using it, but that could be attributed to just more brushing and flossing in general with a better toothbrush)."
9224,"Some Crest rep gave your dentist a pile of that product so that his patients would see it and go out and buy it. Dentists DGAF and one of mine said plain baking soda would be good enough. My great-uncle died at 85 with all his teeth in great shape and only ever used baking soda. (Still, I went out and bought pricey Crest 3D White last week to see if it will get rid of my stains :)"
9225,10 out of 10 dentist dont recommend a brand they simply recommend brushing. if they do recommend a brand they are getting kickbacks from that company so their recommendation is worthless.
9226,I can't believe there is one in ten disagreeing.
9227,"I’ve never heard of getting toothpaste kickbacks, ever. If they’re selling out of their office or writing a prescription, maybe. But no way someone is giving kick backs for a purchase that can’t even be traced."
9228,"not saying it happens but if a dentist was to say to me ""i recommend colgate"". im going to assume he is getting something for saying that. after all toothpastes are all basically the same. i should know because i buy whatever is the cheapest at the time and have for decades and aside form flavor there is no difference."
9229,"Fair, but I am a dentist. I worked in clinical trials and Colgate did a bunch of research on how different toothpastes worked. So they’re spending the time and money to develop new products, I use Colgate because of that. Also, I make enough fixing teeth. Not trying to get in trouble for toothpaste kickbacks."
9230,"to be honest i assumed it was much like doctors and drugs. they prescribe whatever rep has given them 'conference holidays'. i dont see any difference between pharmaceuticals and street drugs except doctors are legal dealers.

nothing against you or other dentists but i go every 5 years or so for a cleaning and feel like im ripped off because some hygienist picks at my teeth for about 5 min and says im good and they charge me about $150. i wish i made $150/5 min."
9231,"Yeah, I get that: and yes it is expensive. It’s also insanely expensive to run an office and all the supplies we have are wildly overpriced by the suppliers because “dentistry”. Just cleaning a room with the proper chemicals and putting all the plastic barriers and sterilized instruments costs like $40 last I checked. Also, I would suggest going a little more often. A lot of stuff can sneak up on you and cost you a fortune in a matter of years. But from the initial post, basically anything with fluoride is fine haha."
9232,"i can see how costs have gone up due to coivd and in general cleaning. 

out of curiosity i would like to know how much you make an hour actually in someones mouth considering hygienists do about 70% of the work (100% in my case).

""go more often"". so my dentist can make more money doing nothing? sounds like something a dentist would say. :)

im almost 50 i have had 3 cavities in my life all before i was 16 when i never brushed my teeth at all.  i only brush once a day in the morning now. i have had my saliva tested by a dentist because they wanted to know how my mouth stays so good with little care. i have a rare enzyme that protects my teeth naturally i am told.

once every 5 years is enough considering i always have a great record with no issues. the longest i have spent at a dentists lately is for xrays. like i said i usually spend about 5 - 10 min in the chair.

could there not be a setup in charging based more on the work needed and less on a set $X/appointment. maybe i would pay $40 to have my teeth cleaned and john with a bad mouth would pay $200 to have his cleaned. that seems more in tune with cost vs work."
9233,"From what I've read, the ""9 out of 10 dentists recommend"" is because the survey isn't exclusive. The dentists were always allowed to select multiple brands - and most are like ""does it have flouride? then yes i'd recommend it"""
9234,"i think the brand goes and asks 100 dentists then picks 9 that say ya colgate is good and the one that doesnt. 9/10 doesnt mean they only asked 10. and its not the dentist advertising its the toothpaste brand. what brand is going to say we asked 10 dentists and only 4 recommended our brand.

basically its a selling gimmick there is no proof behind it."

9237,"The biggest mistake people make--that's understandable and almost universal--is rinsing out toothpaste after brushing.  

Most toothpastes are made with ""strengthening"" chemicals that help your teeth, and you shouldn't rinse out your mouth after brushing.  Just spit until there's no more toothpaste in your spit, and let the remaining paste coat your teefers until it naturally washes away.  It's a small amount, it won't hurt your tummy."
9238,i have NEVER heard of anything like this in my entire lifetime
9239,If you ever get prescribed special toothpaste such as high fluoride they tell you this and also not to use mouthwash at the same time as brushing as it washes the fluoride off. I think my high fluoride even has it on the packaging not to wash your mouth out after.
9240,I changed dentists about 2 years ago and he told me this for the first time. Takes a little while to firstly stop doing it out of habit and then getting used to the feel of it in your mouth.
9241,mmmm teefers
9242,Are you a dentist??
9243,"No, he’s just a mad man."
9244,"I mean really, is he a dentist or just some guy on the internet?! If I’m gonna change, I’d like to double check my source :)"
9245,Damn.. I've actually never heard this anywhere
9246,"We recommend, whatever toothpaste That u Like. Im not dentist But dentist assistant. We only recommend certain toothpastes when u have issues like sensitive teeth and gums. Also when we talk toothpaste we mean the ones with fluoride, please no toothpaste with aloe Vera..."
9247,Gotta treat those teeth burns...
9248,Sensodyne
9249,I hate that commercial so much
9250,Crest Gum Detoxify has been my go-to lately
9251,"I think the last time this question was asked it was recommended, I’ve been using it since then and it’s good!"
9252,If I may add a follow up question...what does non-fluoride toothpaste do exactly? From my understanding it's the mechanics of brushing that are most important and it's the toothpaste that just puts a thin coating of fluoride on your teeth for enamel health.
9253,"The fluoride doesn't form a thin coat on your teeth, it actually hardens them, especially against acids, which are made by bacteria when we eat sugary stuff"
9254,TIL. Thx!
9255,"As of what I have been taught, enamel has small pores to let ions infuse in. Enamel is made up of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals so infusion of Fluoride ions replaces the calcium ions in the outer layers and thus forming Fluoroapatite crystals that are much more resistant than the former. Enamel breaks down when pH falls below 5.5 while fluoroapatite can resist the breakdown for 30 mins or so(as I have been said).

Ions infusing is also the reason why carbonated drinks are to be avoided because if carbonate ions replace the hydroxyl ion, it renders the molecule more soluble in acids and thus would breakdown easily.

P.S. I am still a 1st yr Dentistry student so I might be wrong in parts, would be grateful if a dentist checks and corrects me :)"
9256,"Make your breath smell nice, mostly. Some of them do contain other surfactants (foamy stuff - the main one in conventional toothpastes is sodium laureth sulfate or SLS). Surfactants help clean but they’re mostly there because we expect our toothpastes to lather up."
9257,I mean it allegedly turns the frogs gay
9258,Im preety sure flouride has some allergins in it
9259,"It's chemically and biologically impossible for fluoride to be an allergen. But maybe there could be other very rare intolerances against it, i don't know for sure. Tooth paste without fluoride doesn't work well. But kids' tooth pastes have less fluoride in them, because kids tend to swallow tooth paste. But as long as you spit out your tooth paste and don't eat it, you are fine."
9260,Ok but why biologically. Contaminants are a thing.
9261,Allergens are defined as proteins. Fluoride is not a protein

9266,"Burts bees zen mint charcoal paste 











I'm not a dentist"
9267,"Charcoal toothpaste is actually abrasive and can cause abrasion to your teeth, leading to tooth structure loss.

I'm a dental student."
9268,"I have heard about that, but isn't that referring to the actual charcoal powder stuff in a jar? This toothpaste I use looks just like other toothpaste in a tube and doesn't seem to be abrasive. I'm just honestly curious, because as I said I have read about this issue with charcoal"
9269,"There are still little particles of charcoal in it that can cause abrasion. It's possible that the particles in your toothpaste are so fine that the abrasion is minimal, but I would still avoid charcoal toothpastes."
9270,Alright looks like I'm gonna retire this toothpaste. Thank you!
9271,What do dentists think about the fluoride and how it supposedly ‘blocks the powers of the pineal gland’?
9272,"Fluoride on your teeth is good. Swallowing excess fluoride is bad. That's why children's toothpaste is less fluoridated, they tend to swallow more while brushing."

9275,"I'm not a dentist. 

But I have to wonder, if we get 9 comments in a row of dentists agreeing on one type of toothpaste, does there have to be a 10th that disagrees?"
9276,"As a 1st yr dental student, I am searching for this answer"
9277,"Dental nightmare here. I've been seeing my dentist every few weeks since I finally grew the balls to step up and get my shit fixed. 

We've gone over this quite a bit, because there are these wild toothpastes all over the world that are expensive and make crazy claims. (Especially in Japan, like holy shit, you can get a $300 tube of toothpaste that claims it rebuilds your teeth over there.) 

His answer is always, ""does it have flouride? Good. That's the one."" 

It can be one from Dollar Tree or some expensive one that promises to whiten your teeth in x amount of weeks. (It probably won't, and might have abrasive stuff in it that will do more harm than good.)

Also, worth noting, be extremely careful with foreign toothpastes. Most are pretty good, but some can have some really unsavory stuff in them. Imagine my surprise when I read a study done on a few brands of Indian toothpaste, and one I had used before, Colgate Herbal, was found to contain fucking nicotine. 

If anyone has any questions about general dentistry stuff and the mistakes you can make as a patient, i'll happily try and answer, and i'm sure my dentist would be receptive, too."
9278,Not a dentist (Reddit Bingo) but my goto has been the Arm and Hammer stuff.
9279,9 out of 10 dentists recommend washing your teeth with any toothpaste. The remaining 1 out o 10 is against washing teeth.
9280,"I am not a dentist, but i can tell you that SENSODYNE is the best tooth paste, even if it's available only in Romania. And costs like 5x more times then a normal toothpaste. It is deffinetly worth getting since it's a high quallity and cleans your teeth very well."
9281,I’m sure if they could they wouldn’t recommend anything that would be helpful and would recommend stuff that rots your teeth so they get more business and more money.
9282,"Not true. I’m a dentist. Just like people are supposed to diet and exercise, many don’t brush and floss as often or as thoroughly. Despite coaching people relentlessly on how to be better, many just won’t do anything until they have to or until it’s too late. It makes my freaking day when someone shows up and their teeth are gorgeous, I legit get giddy and tell them how great they’re doing- one less person I have to preach to. 

Any toothpaste with fluoride, sensodyne if your teeth hurt with cold water. But above all else, get an electric toothbrush. Spend the $100 and get a sonicare or an oral-b and floss at night. I honestly believe it’s the cheapest and best investment you can make for long term dental health. Oh! And don’t forget to brush along the gum line!"
9283,"I'm not a dentist but can I un recommend some stuff. First off activated charcoal has ruined my front teeth. My dentist says no activated charcoal and nothing w baking soda or peroxide. It wears the hell out of your teeth down. Activated charcoal obliterated my front teeth so bad my dentist took a mold as a ""test case"" to his fellow dentists for free just to see if it can actually be fixed."
9284,Sensodyne. I have sensitive teeth and it’s the only thing that helps (that I’ve tried)
9285,Does it help with sensitive gums and teeth ?
9286,"Teeth for sure, idk about gums because I don’t have sensitive gums"
9287,"As long as it has fluoride it's good, and avoid whitening ones, and also the trendy charcoal ones. But brushing twice a day and flossing every night is the most important part. And there are other little habits to keep your teeth nice and strong like not brushing your teeth right after eating or drinking anything, and not using your teeth on hard things like cracking open pistachios. Many people also need mouthguards when sleeping to protect against grinding"
9288,I agree with all your advice. I never go near thise charcoal and whitening ones. I don’t bite into hard foods either because I don’t want to chip more teeth. I already have enough damage done sadly .
9289,"Dentist told me to avoid the whitening toothpastes as they really do a number on your enamel!  I had no idea until I told her at my last cleaning that I'd been experiencing some temperature sensitivity all of a sudden...I just thought it was because I was older and when she found out that I had been using whitening toothpastes, she told me to stop.

best thing is to floss at night every night and brush twice daily (AM, PM).

Avoid sugary things as much as possible.

what also helped me - and I have no idea if this actually helps - but after eating or drinking anything other than water, I always rinse my mouth with water.  It seems to help (?) because in my 46yrs, I have only had 3 cavities and both were tiny enough that it could be filled w/out freezing.  The last time I went to the dentist prior to my last visit was about 2yrs, no cavities."
9290,"Great advice. I would also like to add to avoid snacking as much as possible. It’s bad for your teeth. Also in addition to water to rinse out your mouth xylitol gum, celery or a hard cheese help to neutralize acids after a meal

 If you have sensitive teeth GC tooth mousse is great or a paste with recaldent or novmin/ biomin technology"
9291,Thanks for the advice. I agree with whitening toothpastes. I avoid them all the time.
9292,"Get Colgate Prevident 5000, it's prescription only, I get from my dentist. It's much higher in fluoride than store-bought for added tooth decay protection, and it helps with tooth sensitivity too.

I alternate it with any regular store-bought toothpaste..."
9293,"Interesting, I don’t know if my dentist would prescribe it for me but I’ll ask. He’s pretty annoying."
9294,"You can probably ask your doctor too, and get it filled at a pharmacy.

My dentist sells it for $12..."
9295,I’ll ask him when I get my cleaning .
9296,"I saw it on Amazon, is it Colgate gel cam?"
9297,"I saw that too, it's definitely not that bc that has stannous fluoride (the tooth stain formula).

My tube says Colgate PreviDent 5000 Plus, it's 5000 ppm fluoride and 1.1% sodium fluoride. 1.8 oz / 51 grams size"
9298,Ok thanks for telling me .
9299,"pretty surprised a lot of comments are mentioning that whitening toothpaste or those with stannous fluoride are bad. from what I’ve read stannous fluoride targets gingivitis and other fluorides don’t. whitening ingredients are at low concentrations and shouldn’t negatively affect your dental health, if used as stated by mfg. many toothpastes that aren’t advertised as whitening may also contain the same abrasives in whitening toothpaste that could potentially harm enamel as well. this is just what I’ve gathered but it’s still a real concern- just wanted to put my opinion out there!

imo best habit is to floss regularly, brush (with a fluoride toothpaste) after you floss, don’t rinse away the toothpaste, and don’t use mouthwash after you brush your teeth. floss regularly after meals. don’t forget to scrape your tongue. 

speaking on vanity’s sake since this is /r/beauty I do think whitening toothpaste and whitening strips make the biggest difference if you cannot afford a whitening session with dentist. Colgate has a 3% peroxide toothpaste that has made an extreme difference in my teeth appearance, my gum health is fine. perhaps use in moderation/reduce use once your teeth are at the desired color if there’s concerns 

there is also another toothpaste i looked into, haven’t bought yet because I have a lot. it’s called sensodyne with novamin, it’s only available in Canada iirc but you can order on Amazon. novamin is an ingredient that can repair enamel and reduce teeth sensitivity."
9300,Thanks for the great advice. It’s overwhelming because there’s many choices. I did read that stannous fluoride is healthy for teeth. I just want a toothpaste that reduces the risk of cavities and helps with enamel.
9301,"Also, be careful with the toothpastes that have stannous flouride (like Paradontax) or gum rinses with Cetylpyridinium chloride (like Colgate Gum Health). You can use occasionally but don't use primarily as they can cause tooth surface staining, which is removable by the hygienist, but I'm sure you don't want your teeth looking worse"
9302,Really ? Thanks for the advice .
9304,Thanks for the insight. What about the toothpaste with scope? I feel I need mouthwash and mint for fresh breathe .
9305,"My dentist told me not to rinse out my toothpaste after brushing, just spit it out and that's it. That allows it to sit on the teeth longer"
9307,I’m sure it isn’t good for anyone . Yuck
9308,Yes but that would be hard in the morning when you want to drink coffee ?
9310,"Oh yes that’s true, you’re lucky to have a dentist husband. He will give you great advice on how to take care of your teeth."
9312,Maybe salt water is a good mouthwash too.
9313,"Marvis 100%. I believe it’s an Italian brand on Sephora. It’s Vegan (and natural for the most part I think) and the only toothpaste to ever actually whiten my teeth. After getting some cavities filled, my dentist recommended I started using a toothpaste with xylitol in it (xylitol can help prevent cavities), so I decided to try Marvis since that’s what Shawn Mendes uses (crazy I know, my friend and I saw it in one of his posts haha) and honestly I adore it. Not to mention the flavors are amazing (the whitening and the jasmine mint are my favorites) and the packaging is classy"
9314,"Oh great , thanks I’ll look into it ."
9315,"I live in a hosuehold with 4 dentists, ""whatever we got for promotion"" is a popular pick, but when we buy we usually buy blen-a-med

the only thing we try to avoid is the ones that claim to make your teeth whiter, as those mostly aren't good for your teeth. 

also, please stop whitening your teeth and start flossing"
9316,"For others who might wonder, Blend-A-Med is the name Crest uses in some countries."
9317,"My teeth look kinda stained though, and I brush and floss. Is there any way to whiten them without harming anything?"
9318,Your only option that will work and not damage your teeth much is professional bleaching.
9319,-drinks bleach-
9320,Make sure the bleach is professional. Maybe dress up the bottle in a suit
9321,Godammit.
9322,I feel your pain. I floss and brush twice daily for like 5 years but when i was a kid i didnt ever floss and i would brush my teeth once a day/every other day/every other other day..plus i love coffee so my teeth are fucked.
9323,Drink any teeth staining drinks through a straw.
9324,*Sips straw through front teeth.*
9325,What does the whitener do and why is it bad? Genuinly interested.
9326,[explained it here with poor english already ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4d5bof/dentists_of_reddit_what_toothpaste_is_in_your/d1o8hdg)

9330,"I like sensodyne because it doesn't burn when I use it (most of them do), but nobody seems to like the taste of it when kissing them"
9331,It smells like something you'd spray on the lawn to me.

9333,"Ah, the ol' elephants-of-France logic"
9334,"Wait, this has a name? I just used to say I was a monster hunter. When asked about it I would ask if they saw any monsters around and then say 'You're Fucking Welcome.' Not sure where I got it from."
9335,"It doesn't really have a name, I just made the name up based on a similarly structured joke about elephants in France. An old man is sprinkling salt in the streets to keep the elephants away and <insert punchline>

I figured the joke is at least well know enough that someone will know what I'm talking about."
9336,Thanks. I like learning the origins of sayings and jokes.
9337,It was a [Simpsons bit from a 1996 episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSVqLHghLpw).
9338,Wow that is so accurate.
9339,I've found that most regular tooth pastes give me fucking terrible sores in my mouth. But sensodyne doesn't have X ingredient and i rarely get canker sores anymore.
9340,"I did a christmas stocking exchange with my dentist neighbor last year, and the stocking he gave me was stuffed with tiny bottles of toothpaste. At first I thought it was cute. ""Awww.. he's so into dentistry that he gives toothpaste as gifts."" Then I realize he's just a cheap bastard that gave me a bunch of free samples from his office.

He dresses up as the tooth fairy and gives out the same toothpaste on Halloween. (Plus candy)"
9341,"Cheap bastard or not, if there's one time giving toothpaste to someone is appropriate, it's probably Halloween."
9342,"Yeah, if your goal is to get your house egged to oblivion."
9343,"This is so true. My mum has been a dentist for like 30 years and she only ever uses samples of whatever toothpaste she's given. Whenever I see her she always asks if i want any toothpaste because she gets given so damn much.

I just asked her what she recommends and she said ""Anything with flouride, everything else is just bullshit companies are using to get you to buy it. Toothpaste is toothpaste"" Thanks mum :)"
9344,"That's like a mechanic who tells people, ""ya know, you really only have to change your oil every *20,000* miles""."
9345,Every rotary engine will love it :D
9346,"NO oh god no, mine needed like a quart a month.......ahh the ol'e leaky 13b's......memories.....  /cry"
9347,No one can say you did not see it coming :D

9349,yeah here in Europe especialy in  the  U.K. are RX8 for dirt cheap pretty tempting for me to do something stupid and watch myself going straight to bankrupcy :D
9350,"Those are the best. Pull into the gas station, fill up on oil and check the gas.  Since it's burning a quart a month, it's always topped off  with fresh stuff, and doesn't need changing."
9351,pretty much every oil change i got the oil came out clean....lol
9352,"They aren't leaky they have oil injection, hence they burn oil by design."
9353,"you assume too much, mine was 100% leaky.  
  
and it also burnt oil.....i love that car."
9354,Fair enough. Mines been trouble free for years. It could be that I never get to drive it!
9355,Were the spark plugs still good?
9356,"Not really.



She tells you they're all the same, so you choose the cheapest one. Or the one you think tastes better. It's not a nonanswer, they're all the same thing."
9357,"Its more like a mechanic telling you to just buy whatever API rated oil you want in the proper weight.Which is what I tell people, because it's true."
9358,I am in dental school and we have reps visit us each month. My current toothpaste are samples that they leave.
9359,"Yeah. I've asked my mom, a dental hygienist, and she's always said ""if it's got fluoride in it, I'd recommend it"""
9360,"Can you ask if all mouthwashes are the same too? My dentist recommends only Act™ mouthwash every time, but I suspect its cause they got paid to."
9361,"Not in the dental field, but my dentists have always suggested Listerine or Act. My current dentist helped me figure out that Crest Pro Health was actually staining my teeth (it's even a warning on their label), so I would avoid that."
9362,Listerine stained my teeth. I think it was either the blue or purple one.
9363,"I've gotten warnings against Listerine, from my dentist, because it has alcohol in it that kills the ""good bacteria"" as well. She says to use a fluoride mouthwash from the pharmacy, not one with alcohol."
9364,">http://news.crest.com/faq-item/health-rinse/does-crest-pro-health-rinse-stain-teeth-brown

Was it turning them brown? Because that's what happened to me."
9365,"Yup, exactly. Not a smoker, I stopped drinking red wine, and my teeth got browner! It finally resolved when I stopped using that mouthwash. Lovely that the company heralds that as a sign the product is working!  No thank you."
9366,"Act has fluoride, while the standard Listerine and whatnot don't. Basically it's easier to just say ""go buy Act"" instead of saying ""go buy Scope or Listerine, but not the normal kind, but the one with the label that has fluoride"""

9368,I know a dental assistant whose partner works for P&G. So it is either the samples from the practice or the excess marketing samples from her partner's work.
9369,They can vary pretty widely in terms of abrasiveness.
9370,"I said this on /r/everymanshouldknow and ill put it here aswell:

My parents are dentists and so are their friends and so are their friends' friends and let me tell you what I have learnt: only 2 things matter. Now, you may think I am oversimplifying or trying to keep it short and snappy to make it sound good but no! Literally only 2 things matter! Got that?

Now, here are the two questions you ask: does it have Flouride? The exact salt doesn't matter but does it advertise Flouride? If it doesn't then it is not worth your time and money. Seriously, without a doubt Flouride is good for your teeth and fucking essential in tooth paste. The rest doesn't add any benefit. Flouride plus good brushing technique and you have perfect teeth (floss aswell but I don't have time to lecture you on that). If you want brand reccomendations I have been reccomended Colgate ALL MY LIFE (I'm not exaggerating I can't believe everyone around me wasn't a paid sponser) but Oral B's pro expert (great naming guys) is also good.

Question 2: Do I have sensitive teeth? Really you should know this already most people do. If you have sensitive teeth (ie pain when you eat something hot or cold (see your dentist and not me!)) you get special tooth paste, which also has Flouride (essential stuff). The main brand for senstive toothpaste in the UK is sensodyne.
Now lastly, you may be thinking but what about things like whitening, salts, baking soda, natural (whatever the hell they decide to put), fresh breath and deep clean? All marketing bullshit, there is a reason I said only 2 question the rest doesn't matter what so ever just ignore it because it is a waste of your goddamn time. As a matter of fact whitening toothpastes are bad for your teeth. The yellow-ish tint is not bad its hard stuff that has developed over ages. Make no mistake ""whitening"" means mild corrosive and you don't want that, not at all.

TLDR: All that matter is that it has flouride and is for sensitive teeth (if you have sensitive teeth). Also, whitening is bad."
9371,You're like hermione granger right now - laying down the serious details while be factual. PLUS your parents are dentists! I hope you have a good story about a kid biting your father's finger for us all.
9372,"I asked them after dinner if they've ever  even bitten and they shrugged it off so casually I imagine it's not worth note. Although one of them did tell me they got bitten by a 30 year old woman a couple of days ago, a completely normal patient otherwise (at least I think,  they didn't say there was anything out of the ordinary about the lady). She was apologetic but I still find the idea amusing, I hope it was somewhat what you were looking for."
9373,I can't wait to hear what the 10th dentist of reddit uses.
9374,9/10 dentists would reccomend Oral-B pro-health to a friend. The 10th has social skills and doesn't discuss the pros and cons of toothpaste brands with his friends.
9376,"I'm pretty sure the options for this sort of thing aren't ""Oral-B vs some other brand"", it's ""Oral-B vs no toothpaste"""
9377,Then who the fuck is voting for no toothpaste!
9378,He was in a loud room when they called him. He misunderstood the question. And thought they were trying to sell him something.
9379,"No he's paid off but he's just lazy, wooooo free moneyyyy"
9380,this may seem kinda weird but will you rawdog me
