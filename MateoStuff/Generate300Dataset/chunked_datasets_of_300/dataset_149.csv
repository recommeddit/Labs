47927,"I actually love the Downing Straw color. I just wasn’t happy with the paint quality. I didn’t feel like it covered the way Behr does, and the sheen wasn’t to my liking. I like eggshell and this is closer to satin. It’s not horrible, but the whole experience was irritating."
47928,"I just haven't had the luck with color & lighting replication, like I have with Behr on my last/final painting round. 6 years ago I repainted with Valspar & was so upset with the product & outcome, but it was all I could afford. My house looked like the ultra budget-off brand version, of the off brand product I was using. 

After raising my budget 3 years later, I switched to Sherwin. Although not an enjoyable outcome, it was acceptable for the time. My poor experiences could've been due to poor staff training or unclean machinery. I wouldn't have put it past the 'Standards' of my whale-mart soo..
Sherwin is great for industrial/non-personal/general application though!"
47929,"The other thing that got on my last nerve was the trimming. I can usually trim with brush only. The Sherwin stuff was impossible to do with the type of brush I normally use to trim with when using Behr. I had to severely downscale in size and use a small artist’s brush to get the clean lines (because the paint was thick, like honey and just wouldn’t flow), which took much longer/more work. Oh, and four coats of the trim paint. But, now that it’s all done and the room put together, it looks nice. The color is very nice in our ‘29 bungalow bedroom with zen touches."
47931,It’s lovely. But in 2 years beige will be the new neutral. And in 5 it will be grey again.
47932,"I'm also interested to know. I'm building a new house with mid century modern style in mind, with lots of white/gray/cool colors (white cabinets, gray countertops, white trim, etc.) Which wall color would go best with this style?"
47933,"Sherwin Williams has a historical color palette collection that you could pull inspiration from or use. Mid century modern used a lot of bold colors and patterns such as turquoise, hot pink, mustard, avocado, tans, and tons of wood (mainly red and yellow undertoned). It's kinda came back in style (in a more modernized way). Textures also play a huge part (mixing natural elements with shiny man-made things). If I remember my design history correctly, this was a post war effort to lift spirits and make things happy again. Worth noting there is a drastic difference in the design and architecture of the 30s-40s and the 50s."
47934,"Mid-century modern, blended Modern (30's) and Contemporary('44-45) minimalism(60's-70's). I feel like it was/is The Benjamin Button, of the American visual design arts movement.  

I've never been formally educated in interior design, but I'm totally open to being corrected on the subject!"
47935,"No, you're right in sense they kind of blend together with style (furniture, texture, etc...) I guess what I'm referring to is mainly color palette. 30s/40s were a tad more bland in color palette (pastels, neutrals) 50s introduced a lot more boldness in color; although I haven't studied up on my design styles in a long while."
47936,100% not being rude. Get a color wheel & create your own triad pallet.
47937,"Can you point in the right direction, how do I get this ""color wheel""?"
47938,"I've attached an Amazon link to the physical one I use for everything.
You can also use an app like color harmony(free in the play store) or just use a Google images result.

47943,"I am in communication with a lot of home developers in Arizona and have seen nearly every model home in the East Valley.

I have seen a lot of materials used as wall coverings rather than paint. From wood plank flooring, to metal sheets, to textured fabrics.

I'm not sure how much this translates to real world usage. But, for the most part, what I have seen has been done really well. Though, some that I see have a look that instantly gives me a ""that's going to look dated really quickly."""

47947,"My fave color is BM gray owl. I asked them to cut it by 25% and I adore it.   It’s in my kitchen which is a north facing room that gets some light. Repose gray looks really good in my dining room which is a south facing room and light floods it. I have a two story, north facing  living room but it has sliding glass doors at bottom and a second set of windows up top so a decent amount of light. Since it’s such an expanse to be one color I tried to go with something that would fit all that and collinwood gray does a great job. The entry is south facing so a ton of light and the collinwood looks good there also. Pinterest is a great source to start with."
47948,"> BM gray owl

47959,"My main house color is grey. I have a two story living room and it was [murder red/orange](https://i.imgur.com/veywOe7.png) when I got it.[I painted it grey](https://i.imgur.com/CsfOkQJ.png) (Behr Silver Bullet) that is a true gray to me. Not gray beige or grey white. All of my big room areas and tall areas are gray and [hallways.A](https://hallways.AI) I used large bright pictures and [artwork to add color](https://i.imgur.com/eDJ7BEm.png) and interest. The kitchen is cream and the dining room and [library are brightly colored](https://i.imgur.com/zNBMDvh.png) as they are large rooms with lots of windows. Bedrooms are all colorful as are the bathrooms.  Main floor bathroom I went with wainscotting and cream with bright  murals.

&#x200B;

I really love the gray. Once I finish repainting all the trim and replacing the trashed flooring the gray acts as to brighten and illuminate but not overpower or offend. I love blues and the gray stops me from painting my entire house blue. I just decorate in it instead."
47960,"Grey all day, with a trend toward warm grey, and away from cool grey."
47961,Emerald green
47962,Warm greys and dark jewel tones.
47963,"Gray, greige, some light, gray/blues are pretty neutral, taupe"
47964,"I like cabernet red matte paint. 

I redid my living room with this & love it for low light areas.

I offset the rest with a matte warm beige paint. 

It's really about what colors speaks to you IMO. I repainted my house 4 times until I found the right pallet that suited my moods."
47965,is plain old white in or out these days?
47966,Plain old white is very much in. Especially if you pair it with brightly colored accent pieces.
47967,"It's up to you. I use it in my natural lit rooms. I just suggest using a matte based sheen. It's more modern looking, IMO."
47968,Various shades of grey.

The words ""on trend"" are a slight against all people making aesthetic decisions."
47976,Just painted my appartment light grey everyone said really thats sounds so boring when we were done everything popped and everyone loved it
47977,I like the idea of a darker grey in a baby’s room. I think I read that in infancy they may only see black and white. They need that high contrast. I have seen many do and black and white checker board with very intense colors which I love. And babies see it better.
47978,"Not an interior designer, but I've noticed a ton of whites/greys or neutrals. Also, red front doors. Not sure why the red doors."
47979,It makes Passover easier ;}
47980,"Years ago, people would paint their doors red to signal that they had paid off their mortgage and owned their home free-and-clear. So it was seen as a status symbol and a way to signify wealth."
47981,"Oh wow, neat! Thanks for the info."
47982,That's actually super interesting! Thanks for sharing
47983,Pretty sure this is a scam to get idiots to paint their living rooms orange.
47984,I've got been thinking of painting one wall orange. Never the whole room though.
47985,Been there done that. Never again.
47986,"Same here. Huuuuuuge mistake. 

Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.

Also had a friend who's parents painted their dining room that red. It was like eating in a murder room. Definitely not appetizing or good for social contact. It was oppressive."
47987,"> Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.
> 

Also, when you want to sell the house, it's a hell of a lot easier to put the art/furniture/etc in storage and stage neutral art/furniture, than to have to repaint the walls."
47988,"Feature walls can also be a huge selling point, they just have to be done right. Your neutrals undertones should pair nicely with the colour you pick for the feature wall."
47989,"Or you can go flat out. I've got long narrow room in my house, with a good sized window in the western wall and the door on the north wall east end.  I went with a deep rose on three walls and the whitest white I could stand on the east wall. Summer sunsets bounce off the white and glow into the hall. I usually watch the sun set in my west facing back yard. Sometimes I watch it in my hallway. It's never just about the colour of paint. It's about how that colour responds to the light that comes into the room, and the light you make in the room."
47991,"Or at the least consult with someone who knows what they are doing. And that means an interior designer, not the schmuck behind the counter at home depot. I've worked in a high end paint store part time for a year now and still would not feel confident recommending that, I pass people who want a colour consult off to our people on staff who have design certificates."
47992,"My parents painted their bedroom murder red and keep it dark. It was like walking into a hotel room from the shining or american horror story after a murder scene..never understood why my mom thought it was such a ""pretty"" color...oh well..to each their own!"
47993,"you'll find that the ideal murder dining room is cobalt blue, with an ostentatious herb garden and Leda and the Swan over the fireplace"
47994,"Yeah, cause then you have an orange wall."
47995,"Why is this a huge mistake? I painted the east-west walls red, and the north-south walls orange... I'm also completely colourblind."
47996,Our rustic orange looks really nice around the fireplace!
47997,"ITS CALMING, YOU REALLY SHOULD!!"
47998,Trust me when I say you'll get sick of that *really* quick.
47999,"I actually painted a corner orange in my old house, I had the TV at 45° and in that corner with a very warm lamp placed behind it. It ended up making a beautiful sunset-like glow that would light up the room and look great!"
48000,"I say do it! Make sure you have a lot of your old color in case you don't like it, and maybe some primer so you don't have to use so many coats. It's really not that hard to paint a wall."
48001,"A dark gray/black/almost purple-ish comes out good if you accent some walls.

48002,We have an orange living room with warm accents and it looks quite nice and inviting.

48004,"Color is a bit off because it's still dark out but [here](http://imgur.com/a/Are1c)

48005,Is your pc hooked up to your tv?
48006,"Yep.  
Pretty great arrangement. Can watch anything you want."
48007,Not exactly orange paint but [this](http://i.imgur.com/lLhF7xH.jpg) is pretty good.
48008,I'm curious about how you accent a warm color with other warm accents and it doesn't look like some awful clash (red/orange or yellow/orange are all I can think of)
48009,Always wanted a DeusEx living room. Don't see a problem with this.
48010,Watch it buddy! I'm very happy with my orange living room!
48011,"I have an orange room in my house. Well, three fourths of a room. It's pretty open concept. It's our music/hangout room where we keep all our instruments and have a big comfy sectional. We balanced it out with a lot of blues and it looks wonderful. Certainly not for everyone but at the end of the day it's only paint 😄"
48012,Or a scam to sell more paint...
48013,"A friend of mine has an orange living room and it looks really good. It's a smaller room and a deep orange. If the room were bigger, it might look life a circus."
48014,"""Science"" says orange stimulates conversation and brings calm to the room, Boner4SCP106!"
48015,I used to work in a paint department and we found a stereotype that a ton of Latinos apparently insist on having a hideous terracotta orange room somewhere in their house.
48016,"We call it ""Salmon"". Stupid word that we don't pronounce phonetically. Stupid fish can't even figure out how to breed without dying."
48017,Wait wait.  Do I listen to the comments or to the guide?
48018,"It's pretty much the way this sub goes:

- Look at guide

- Think it's kinda cool

- Visit comments

- See how much said chart gets shit on

- Leave disappointed"
48019,Lmao facts
48020,You'd love /r/gifrecipes then.
48021,Is this sarcasm? I just looked at a few threads and it seemed ok so far...
48022,"Nah, gif recipes complains about a lot. They will complain if you use premade doughs, that so many recipes with cheese make the front page, how no healthy recipes make the front page. Still a cool sub though."
48023,But why? Wouldn't video recipes make so much more sense? I can't easily pause and rewind a gif

48087,"Colour meanings are entirely subjective. They change from person to person and culture to culture. 

If you're going to advise on colour get into proper colour theory and look at *actual* scientific results.

The only reputable scientific study I have found on the physical effects of colour are recorded by Johannes Itten:

[""Experiments have demonstrated a difference of five to seven degrees in the subjective feeling of heart or cold between a workroom painted in blue-green and one painted in red-orange. That is, in the blue-green room the occupants felt that 59° F was cold, whereas in the red-orange room they did not feel cold until the temperature fell to 52 - 54° F. Objectively, this meant blue-green slows down the circulation and red-orange stimulates it.    
Similar results were obtained in an animal experiment. A racing stable was divided into two sections, the one pointed blue, the other red-orange. ln the blue section, horses soon quieted down after running, but in the red section they remained hot and restless for some time. It was found that there was no flies in the blue section, and a great many in the red section.""](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ofvRhNBgoCoC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=itten+color+blue+green+temperature+room&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XI1YrTdQR2&amp;sig=6tOqnguCqc-136-DeYQxKGdpZi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vYFUUrfJJumhigfXi4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=itten%20color%20blue%20green%20temperature%20room&amp;f=false)

Knowledge of these 'physical' effects can help us to design much more effectively, at a universal level. Essentially, if you want to energise people, use red-orange, if you want to calm people, use blue-green.

It is these kinds of studies that should be of greatest interest to us, as they appear to transcend cultural boundaries.

The other day I was at a friend's house and it was quite cold. He put on his new Apple TV and put a fireplace screen saver on it with a roaring fire burning away. Even though the room temperature had not increased, we all felt warmer because of the fire. The red-orange colouring of the fire had a physical effect on us as we sat there.

48096,"What? No, this is wrong. Blue definitely does not suppress melatonin, it can actually help increase it, unless it's unusually bright and harash and even then it's effect on your melatonin is negligible, especially considering most people turn out the lights when they go to sleep."
48097,Agreed. See comment elsewhere in thread where I revise my opinion based on data.
48098,Really? I was considering a really soft blue. I'll have to rethink it.
48099,"Actually on checking the research I guess blue paint isn't bright enough. Counterintuitively, the reverse seems true: blue rooms make you tired. Avoiding bright blue lights is good as those *will* suppress melatonin. Blue paint, however, helps calm you. Turns out blue is great for bedrooms.

48103,Hence why BDSMs are black. The Sex Cauldron that used to be in Springfield used to be a great one. Hershel Krustofsky used to be a regular.
48104,Wow! That's so disgusting on so many levels...
48105,Sounds like a messed up house
48106,"Isn't blue really bad for falling asleep? I could be completely wrong (and I'm sure I will be corrected, this is reddit after all), but I thought the colour blue activated histamine along with other things that were responsible for being alert and awake (which is why so many people that use smartphones, laptops, etc. have trouble sleeping, because of the blue lit up screens). Could be wrong, but I feel like blue isn't the best colour for a bedroom."
48107,How the fuck do you people sleep? Staring at the wall?
48108,yeah man
48110,fair point!
48111,Science huh?
48112,My full house is painted white
48115,Mine too. And you know what color goes well with white? White does.
48116,Nah. Nice and all but when I'm asleep in my room I can't see the wall color anyways.
48117,Here's a list so every house you come across is the same.
48118,I just bought this small old house with my friend to renevate. My bedroom will have my computer in there so I painted it turqoise to combine green and blue. It actually works really well with the raw log wall.
48119,My bedroom is completely red (not walls but furniture and curtains).... whoops
48120,"But it's black when you sleep, just like every other bedroom so ... I call bullshit on color affecting your sleep."
48121,"In the morning the red curtains make it this deep red, in my mind just like and uterus must have been, and it's great for sleeping! Cozy and comfy"
48122,"Any room where you use a TV, monitor, tablet, or phone with a display should be painted Gray. Any other room color will interfere with your perception of the actual colors being displayed."
48123,"I don't see any scientific references... How is ""Royalty"" a psychological effect?"
48124,This is just dumb.
48125,What colour to paint your fuck off with.
48126,"according to ""Science"""
48127,">According to science

Somehow, I really, really doubt this. Even with the sources below, getting consistent, clear evidence that X color provides X specific behavioral/emotional effects on all, or a majority of individuals seems sketchy as fuck.

I'd be glad to be proved wrong, but boy does it feel fishy."
48128,"If you are afraid to paint a certain color, don't paint at all. That's the only winning move.

I digress. Paint Grey, because you're neutral, timeless, and, practical.

But seriously 'Prince lover' should at least get you into the purple category."
48129,So from which cultural interpretations and influences on color does this guide draw?
48130,"I find Pale blue completely depressing. I had that colour on the walls when I was a kid and my mum still apologises. Hate it so much I won't even wear pale blue. 

A pale blue room is my version of hell."
48131,science is a boring decorator
48132,"60's, stop trying to push your style agenda on us. You're 50 years in the past now."
48133,I just now figured out why it's called red light district.
48134,"TL;DR if you need a guide to tell you what color to paint your room, paint it white."
48135,Not this fucking bullshit again.
48136,I can't get over the mix of nouns and adjectives in the wheel at the top.....
48137,Or just pick a color that you like....
48138,"That house looks like someone puked on the walls. 

Don't do this."
48139,"Hah, my room is colored babyblue and I regularly get less than 6 hours of sleep :c"
48140,[My bedroom is red and greyissh purple with black trim.](http://i.imgur.com/myCRL.jpg)
48141,I just finished housesitting a place with a grey kitchen. It made me want to hang myself

48143,"My wife is an interior designer and this is her mantra. More specifically, her recommendation is to always start with a single item you love (a chair, painting, table lamp, etc) and go from there."
48144,"I'd suspect that if you find a nice rug that you love first, it could really tie the whole room together."
48145,That's just like your opinion man.
48146,"totally, man."
48147,Do you have to use so many cuss words?
48148,Until some goon comes in and pees on it.

48155,PCsNBaseball you're out of your element.
48156,"Or gook.

Edit: The joke was that it's one letter off from goon, and means the same thing as the above comment, though more offensively. Clearly this joke did not go over as well as I had anticipated. I apologize."
48157,"Was going to say this, now I'm glad I scrolled down and decided not to.

Have an upvote to help dig you out of that hole"
48158,Fuck off.
48159,Is what the wife and i did with our living room. I recommend finding the rug first. In our case a nice Persian with subtle browns and red hues.
48160,"Obviously, you're not a bowler."
48161,"Hey, at least he's housebroken."
48162,That must be exhausting.
48163,I love lamp.
48164,"This is how I play the Sims. Usually, I would start with the arcade table."
48165,I usually start with the walls and doors. Then a bunch of fireworks sets and a full family of eight. Then I delete the doors and get the popcorn.
48166,Now you tell me. I just spent 3 weeks re plastering walls re painting walls recarpeting the entire house and buying new furniture. I painted first.
48167,"Wow, now I have an interior design strategy that makes sense to me, something I always assumed I'd never have. Thanks!"
48168,">  always start with a single item you love (a chair, painting, table lamp, etc) and go from there.

48176,Oops...I meant what if.
48177,"Use one of the paint stores that will sell you a very small container of any color.  I found that the little fist-sized bottles were just enough to cover a sheet of posterboard.  I did a dozen that way, and pinned up the poster boards, moved them around, swapped them out, etc."
48178,"One caution on that though if someone is very particular on the color that they are using.

Most samples are going to be sold in a single sheen (generally satin) so if you change to a different sheen the shade will look slightly different. They try to adjust it, but matte and gloss *will* look different.

Also, posterboard has a very different texture than most walls, so again the accuracy won't be perfect.

Not to say that your method wouldn't work, but I've sold paint for a year or so and these are both common problems that turn into major headaches for someone who is *very* particular."
48179,"Yeah, and when applying paint, you have to be very consistent in application technique to get consistent sheen.  I developed the habit when using a roller of doing all the standard rolling on an area, then rolling very carefully in one consistent pass from top to bottom, move over one roller width, do it again, etc."
48180,"Also as a tip, when you first dip the roller and paint on the wall, roll maybe 4-5 strokes then re-dip.  Do this for your first 5-6 dips as this allows the roller to stay fluffy and hold more paint so you will not have to re-dip as often as you continue...

Also, use a bucket and grid instead of a tray and grid, much easier and cleaner

Source: I used to paint for a living :)"
48181,"I did some painting for a living, as part of apartment maintenance.  We used real wool nap rollers, and they rocked.  For walls, we used a roller that I believe was 18"" wide, with 3/4"" nap.  It would hold a monsterous amount of paint.  We had a paint tray that would hold at least a gallon, maybe two.  It was shaped so that you could pick it up with one hand, and it would rotate and act sort of like a bucket, and allow you to carry all that paint securely that way.  Alas, they stopped making those trays!

To paint raised-panel doors, we used a roller that was 9"" or maybe 12"", that had 1.5"" nap.  Seriously.  One and a half inches.  Flap-flop-splat, except that it didn't send any paint splattering around, it delivered it to the door, nicely reaching right down into those ""raised panel"" recesses.  Then I'd go over it with a brush.  I could paint a full door in a couple of minutes, all nicely brushed in."
48183,http://www.thehousingguru.com/images/painttools_bucketgrid.jpg
48185,"Having never painted anything with a roller, I would guess you dip the roller into the paint at the bottom, then roll it up the grid to take it out, to get off enough paint so it doesn't drip everywhere."
48186,"Yep, works and is used exactly like a tray, except it is much easier to move around."
48187,I'll be doing a lot of painting in my new place.  I will totally try this.  Now I just need to find a way to cleanly transfer paint from one 5 gallon bucket to another (since I'll be buying 2 or 3 five gallon buckets of paint+primer).
48188,"Also that. This causes a *ton* of problems for someone that doesn't have a ton of experience.

I also find that wall texture can cause major issues. Knockdown will take paint much differently from orange-peel so you really have to be cautious of choosing the right rollers for each."
48189,"With those people, the problem is not the paint...

You just have to accept that they will find *something* wrong, and not blame the paint, or the posterboard."
48190,also if you are picky on having the shade of color exact buy as few containers as possible as they bigger the paint container the less variance there can be between batches as the small amount it can change becomes smaller as the amount of paint increases
48191,wut?
48192,"When you buy multiple containers of paint, the paint color will usually vary a little bit in each container.

So if you buy 2 big buckets instead of 10 little ones, you can only have 2 slightly different tints rather than 10."
48193,Ahhh...thanks for the condensed version...great tip--I have a lot of painting projects around the corner!
48194,"When less than a 5 gal bucket or whatever: Buy a big empty bucket, dump all the cans of paint in, stir well, and cap the bucket or refill the cans.

When you can't do that, try to use a new can of paint at a corner. When you get to a corner, and you know the can won't last for the next whole wall, open a new can. At some point, pour all the partial cans of paint together and start at the next corner.

Save the paint chip, or make a new one on flat cardstock. Tape it to the can lid so it can be matched years from now.

Saves a lot of headache!"
48195,Why not paint on the wall?
48196,"I went through something like 18 samples.  This way I could put up a couple of samples, take them down, put some others back up, put them on walls that get direct sunshine and  on walls that are in shade, etc.  Then when I was all done, there was no issue of having to paint over sample spots."
48198,"Huh, never heard of that.  After a conversation with the guys at the shop, I came away with the impression that they just mixed up a quart of normal paint in eggshell or something, then divided it out into the little bottles.  They wouldn't do samples for any color that was so pale that it couldn't be mixed up as a quart."
48199,"Poster boards can be moved around a room, into different light, and tried against trim, ceiling, fabrics, etc.

Painting the wall means that the existing colour will alter the appearance of the new colour, unless you prime it first (or unless the existing wall is pure white?). Additionally, each layer of paint changes the texture of the wall, so the patches may be noticeable as a raised, probably smoother, area of the wall after the room is completely repainted.

Our walls have the knockdown texture (orange peel) and we primed and painted patches to test colour... bit of a mistake, as we tried single and double coats. Then reprimed everything and repainted in the new colour. The patches now have 4-6 layers of paint on them, or 2-4 more layers than the surrounding area. 

Fortunately, we are not so tightly wound that this is bothering us...

^^* ^^twitch ^^*"
48200,"You mention the paint being altered by the underlying colors but forget that poster board is a totally different surface. The glossiness and texture of it alone will react differently to the paint and result in a completely different shade. Look up metamerism. 

Really, it would probably be better to use a piece of drywall instead of poster board."
48201,"Poster board, primed, would have been close enough for me. I'm not the one that wanted to choose between a dozen colours, though!

We did a test swatch only to see if we needed to prime the walls before changing the colour. Builder beige actually showed through and darkened the new colour, so we primed.

I can see what you mean about the surfaces, as I also painted a sheet of MDF in the room colour. It backs a bookcase. I sanded it, primed it, painted it two coats. It is very smooth, and it looks very close, but pleasingly brighter, good for the back wall of a bookcase."
48202,Should a sanded that fucker down!
48203,"Then we'd have to put knockdown on it and try to get the texture to match. I'll just keep the lights dim, hang the art, have some cognac. First one to bitch about the paint goes to bed without dinner!"
48204,I've never done it on a poster board but by doing so you can both try many different colors and try them in many different locations in the room.
48205,"Ha, we got all our paint from Benjamin Moore and bought their sample jars first to test.  They're like $6 per jar, must have spent $300 on samples before we found the perfect color....that looked ten times lighter once the wall was painted!"
48206,SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SHERMAN WILLIAMS!
48207,This is a great way of doing things. This way you can see what the color looks like in different lighting and also against the other color choices for other rooms.
48208,"As a former paint store employee, this is the worst! Tinting 12 little plastic bottles is a pain, and we sell those things below cost!"
48209,"Yeah, it's definitely a two-edged sword, customers love them but I sure can see how it would be a pain in the neck for the people having to create them."
48210,"I did this for my living room.  I knew I wanted a grey paint but I couldn't pick from the 5-7 samples I painted on the wall. Some were too warm, some were too cool.

I found a great couch that incorporated greys and I matched a swatch to the couch.  It looks amazing."
48211,"My mother is the *worst* color picker I've ever met... She decided she wanted a soft dove gray in her dining room. She ends up with a super light purple. She wanted a rust/penny color for her door, it ended up nacho cheese orange because the name had copper in it. She wanted a warm apricot color for the bathroom it's this hideous dingy orange carrot color, what's worse is she painted it over this really dark artichoke color green with no primer so the orange was really heavy and muddy looking. Her kitchen is this waaay over saturated smurf blue and the room connected to it is an intense cheeto orange. It's like living in a disgusting vomit of colors."
48212,Your color adjectives really help me visualize everything in the story. Thank you lol.
48213,Should consider a side-career in renaming paint colours to more useful things.
48214,"Oh man, I've been in houses like this!!  I always felt I should have been charged admission."
48215,"My boyfriend and I just moved into a duplex and wanted to paint the walls grey (they were a horrible high-gloss renters'-beigey-tan). We wanted that perfect grey—not too warm, not too cool, not too light or too dark. Trying to achieve that via swatches and paint samples was. a. nightmare. Greys look impossibly different on any given wall, in any given light, and with any given object/other colored surface nearby. I know that's true to an extent with any paint color, but I swear, grey is particularly challenging. It really picks up its surroundings.

We ended up getting so frustrated, we just took a drawer from the (white) kitchen cabinets to Sherwin Williams to get it matched. We had reached our ""fuck it, whatever"" point. They missed the drawer color in a slightly grey direction, but I took home a sample anyway and painted big patches of various walls. Lo and behold, it was the grey we'd been after the whole time. It still looks really different in different areas/light, but it plays nicely with everything else in the space, which none of the other (six, plus waaay more swatches) greys we tried could do.

tl;dr, picking paint colors is a pain in the ass"
48217,"""Now that I have all my furnishings in order, lemme just move everything I moved into my house back out of my house so we can paint it, and move everything back again!!"""
48218,Or just cover them? Or pick them out but don't move them in yet...
48219,"I upvoted both of you, because both arguments seem reasonable to me."
48221,"Depends on the rooms.  I bought a two home with not much are per room and things were tight, fucking pain in the ass covering things and painting.  Next house had large rooms where we could shove everything into the center of the room, cover, paint, no big deal."
48222,"I have always chosen flooring, cabinetry, drapery, paint - in this order - as the selection of choice widens following this method."
48223,it's also a fuckton of a lot easier/cheaper to hang new drapes or repaint than it is to put in new floors or cabinets

48234,"No, that's a terrible tip. Please realize most paint mfgrs have an entire white book."
48235,"> most paint mfgrs have an entire white book

Which is kinda absurd, because the color seen will depend more on  the color of the shirt you're wearing in the room, and on the manufacturer and model of lightbulbs (and even the age of LED bulbs) in the room - than it will on the shade of the paint itself."
48236,"That's why you select the finishes in the same kind of light that will be in the room. And not to sound dickish, but if you can't see a range of whites you might be partially colorblind."
48237,swiss mocha is the best white
48238,Benjamin Moore Dove White is best white.
48239,*sooo* much better than sherwin williams dove white.
