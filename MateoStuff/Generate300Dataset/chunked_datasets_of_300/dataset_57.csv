18555,"[X Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPA0Dhi1VXQDGbkXwjDUzQ)

Guy recreates famous airline incidents in a flight simulator and overlays the actual ATC transcripts. Gives background on the pilots and planes in the beginning and the FAA/NTSB incident summaries at the end. Also adds in any real photos/videos of the incidents if they exist, as well as CGI simulations when applicable. Some of them result in everyone onboard perishing, a handful involve everyone surviving (due to amazing piloting efforts I may add), and others result in a mix of fatalities and survivors but it always keeps you guessing until the end. The causes of the incidents vary from hi-jacking, inclement weather, poor maintenance, and pilot error among others. Each video is about 10 mins long and super informative. Some of my favorites include the gimli glider, flight 855, and the impossible landing of flight 232."
18556,"For some reason, I got suuuuper into air traffic control videos, even ones where there isn't an accident, just an interesting exchange between the tower and pilot. Don't know why... I'm not even a pilot myself.

Then I found the Air Safety Institute channel and binged their ""Accident Case Study"" videos.  Most are not commerical flights; they are typically break-downs of how amateur flights can go so wrong."
