30345,"Scipio was awesome, but i think Hannibal would have won at Zama if the Numidian's hadn't switched sides."
30347,The apostrophe. It doesn't mean what you think it means.
30348,"You're mistaken.  The Numidians employed a legendary war machine, called a *hadn't*, which was operated by a team of highly-specialized mercenary engineers.

If the team of engineers operating the *hadn't* had switched sides, Hannibal would have won."
30349,People are seriously believing your *hadn't* bullshit. I'm giving you an upvote on that alone.
30350,ive decided to spend the rest of my morning reading about this.
30351,Do yourself a favor and download the the three part series [Punic Nightmares](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive/Show-21---Punic-Nightmares-I/Roman-republic-Carthage) from Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.
30352,"Napoleonic Wars (Waterloo,Borodino,Austerlitz,Trafalgar,etc)"
30353,"Trafalgar for sure.  The British rocked up with 27 ships against 33 ships of the combined French and Spanish navies and proceeded to give them an education in naval warfare.  Battle ended with the British having an impressive 22-0 K/D ratio.

I've been on the flagship Victory and you can feel the history in that ship. It just oozes from every beam and plank."
30354,"Dude, I agree that Trafalger is an emotionally stirring, ""fuck yea"" moment in British imperial history.  I too, have been on the Victory and share the everloving shit out of your sentiment, but please let me present the following points:

That 27-33 is a little misleading.  The British had one less 1st-rate (i.e., the Victory) than the coalition force.  The Spanish/French had NO 2nd-rate ships (90ish guns) compared to the British 4.  The British 3rd rates were mostly 74's and an 80-gun, and the Spanish French had about the same weight.  All in all, the fleets were actually very evenly matched, in terms of broadside weight and square-footage of canvas.  

However, the British were at a decided advantage when it came to having their equipment well-maintained, and also in terms of leadership.  The Royal Navy was fanatical about bringing in ships for repairs, re-coppering their bottoms (made them faster, cut down on rot), and keeping them well provisioned with food, powder, and spare parts.  The Spanish and French weren't so lucky, because their supply chains were more disorganized and infrequent.  

Leadership and training is an embarassment of riches for the Royal Navy.  Nelson was a crazy ass savant when it came to banging hot chicks and winning naval engagements.  He'd been decorated so many times by Trafalgar that he was running out of room to pin the medals.  He had with him a selection of captains that were the best of their day.  Collingwood, Hardy, Berry and others were not as famous as Nelson, but were brilliant in their own right. 

Organization and training were retardedly good in the Royal Navy.  Those guys fucking drilled, drilled, drilled.  Guns were practiced at least once a day, and the Royal Navy was famous for being the only force in the world to routinely practice with live ammunition at this time.  Everyone was cross-trained, so casualties could be backfilled in the heat of battle.  If your buddy got his legs blown off, a topman or sailmaker's mate could step in and help fight that gun, no problem.  British officers went to sea as children, and gradually rose through the ranks from captain's servant to warrant officer to midshipman.  Only midshipmen that proved their worth would actually recieve a real commission as a lieutenant.  Only lucky or extremely capable lieutenants became captains.  This ensured that the person with whom you entrusted a giant fucking floating gun battery KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

On the other hand, the Spanish and French forces were much more poorly led, and understaffed.  The French Revolution culled a lot of good officers from the navy that happened to be aristocrats.  The result was that ships were captained by jumped up bosuns and master's mates.  Good seamen, poor captains.  This effect trickled downward, with less-than capable sailors being called upon to perform extraordinary duties that they weren't prepared for.  Talk about being set up for failure.

The coalition fleet was in poor repair at the time, short provisioned, and ill-trained, and undermaned.  AND they were a coalition.  The British were a unified fighting force, serving one master and one King.  

At this point, you'll realize that the numerical disadvantage has about been compensated for.  Let's go for the clincher:  Tactics.

Normally in that age, ships lined up and shot at each other in pretty little lines.  Nelson said, ""Fuck THAT noise.""  He split his force into two columns, gave one to Collingwood, and proceeded to drive perpendicularly into the French/Spanish line in two place, effectively cutting their force into thirds.  Then, he did what the English, Irish, and Scottish do best:  Go batshit fucking insane and start swinging.

The battle devolved into a crazy-ass melee, where the Royal Navy's overwhelmingly better gunnery began to tell, as they were letting off broadsides at a rate of three for every two French/Spanish.  That's right, the smaller force was throwing half-again as many shots as the big guys.  Fuck yes.

Additionally, the French had a silly tactic where they would shoot for the masts and rigging, hoping to disable the enemy and deprive them of maneuverability.  The Royal Navy's philosophy was a little more simplistic:  Get close and pound the everloving shit out of the enemy until they surrendered or were in a position to be boarded.  

So yea, it all worked out pretty well for the British, except for Nelson dying.  Then, because he was so badass and would have probably gotten toasted during the celebration dinner, had he survived, was preserved in a barrel of alcohol until they could get into port, so as to keep the body fresh for the funeral."
30355,"Don't forget that Villeneuve was a pantywaster who was brown-trousered-scared of the British. At the time of the battle he'd decided to retreat, but his ships were so poorly trained that they couldn't tack through the wind or stay on station, resulting in his entire fleet being a crescent-shaped smear on the ocean when Collingwood and the Royal Sovereign bum-rushed them.

About the only ship in the Combined Fleet that distinguished itself was the Redoubtable (French 74) which managed to keep the Victory off the French flagship and needed the combined attentions of both Victory and Temeraire to make it strike. As I recall, the Redoubtable lost well over half their crew dead, with the majority of the survivors wounded. Only 35 men out of 650 made it off that ship alive and uninjured."
30356,"Well, the Spaniards were led by incompetent French with a disdain for everything Spanish, and the Spanish crews were by and large convicts with no experience whatsoever; for most of them it was their first time aboard a ship. But hey, we managed to kill Nelson. Amazing how history is taught depending on where you were born, innit?"
30357,I fucking love this post.
30358,"I'm reading *War and Peace* right now. Really interesting look at those wars. Tolstoy makes them seem so inevitable, yet so pointless."
30359,"Early on, Napoleon was untouchable.  I can't remember which war it was, but he knew that he and another country would be going to war.  So this crazy mother fucker locks himself in a room for 3 days or so with maps of the entire regions.  He comes out, and informs his subordinates that the battle will end at a very specific location in a certain time range.

And he was absolutely correct.  Scary."
30360,"The Spanish Civil War is missing right there, in between the great depression and WW2. A war among two different monarchists, radical catholics, rich, fascists, democrats, poor, anarchists, communists, russians, germans, italians... Nearly every ideology in the world fought that war. There were even civil wars within the Civil War, coups d'etat on one side, the lot. In the meantime, the whole world was awaiting the outcome to see what would happen in the rest of Europe; nobody who mattered on the democracy side (France, Britain, the US) did shit because they were too scared about bothering Hitler in some way.

Maybe in 200 years' time we'll see it as the European Wars. It all started with the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and finished with the Yugoslav War of the 90's, the collapse of the USSR, and the reunification of Germany."
30361,"Europe is the herpes of history - it's just going to flare up again, even if it doesn't seem like it now."
30362,"The Peloponnesian War.  Total war at its finest and worst, where even arch enemies become allies of convenience of coin."
30363,"Look up the Congo Crisis, one of the most messed up series of events in recent history. On June 30th 1960, Patrice Lamumba and the Congo get independence from Belgium. Within a matter of days, his army mutinies, the country is reinvaded by Belgium, and three of his most important regions secede. Being that the Congo has tons of uranium, the US, CIA Russians, Cubans and the UN send their troops and resources. See if you can guess how things end up for Lamumba..."

The Winter War is also where Molotov Cocktails come from - Molotov had radio broadcasts saying they were dropping food aid to the Finns, to get them to come outside, and then dropped bombs, so in return, the Finns dropped ""Molotov Cocktails"" down the exhaust pipes of tanks... (to do this, they'd dress all in white, ski up, drop and ski away, often before being seen)...

No winter gear, unrealistic expectations, rookie troops and pitiful scouting and coordination of troops lead to the disaster on their side.

Stalin personally did us a huge favor by killing / sending most of the generals to Siberia in one of his paranoid streaks."
30383,WuTang?
30384,"I find the topic in general pretty fascinating, and I know a lot of people are going to talk about modern wars, so I'm gonna throw out a few that people might not have thought about.

Alexander's conquests are *amazing* to read about. My favorite example is when Alexander [built a causeway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre) out to the city of Tyre, which was built on an island with walls up to the water. His army hauled stones from the old city of Tyre, threw in the water, and then *walked across to the city,* conquering it. Alexander built an empire to rival *Persia* in 13 years, starting at age 20. That's insane.

Another war (or rather, conquest and the results thereof) that I find endlessly fascinating is the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan. Everyone is familiar with the Mongol horde sweeping across Asia, etc., etc., but a lot of people aren't familiar with what happened next. On one hand, Genghis Khan was responsible for genocide in the Mongolian conquests. No one debates that. On the other hand, under Genghis, the Mongolian empire promoted religious freedom, positions of importance were determined by merit rather than race or religion, and he essentially formed the nation of Mongolia. Kind of a cool contrast."
30385,">Alexander built an empire to rival Persia in 13 years, starting at age 20.

I'm 37, and I haven't built an empire at *all*. Now I feel pretty lazy."
30386,"Well, listen, have you at least *started* besieging an island city-state? I mean, some of us are late bloomers."
30387,"Look, I've been really busy lately with work and stuff. I'll start besieging an island city-state next week. For sure this time."
30388,"When he was 30, Caesar saw a statue of Alexander the Great and wept, lamenting that Alexander had accomplished more than he yet at a younger age.

Then Caesar went on to conquer France, invade Britain, and then win a civil war against the combined armies of the Senate of Rome. I would argue that he is in fact more famous, and has had a more lasting impact, than Alexander.

So do not feel lazy, my friend, before these prodigies who at earlier ages had already acquired fame and fortune, but think rather on Caesar, who stood in your shoes and wept, and then went on to conquer the world."
30389,"Buddy, if I ever become Caesar -- or even Alexander -- you are *so* getting a job in my imperial court as my official pick-me-up speechwriter. Consider it a promise.

And you have a point. Let the young upstarts conquer their central Asias and northeast Africas. Us old salts are much better off doing the real work, like dividing Gaul into three parts."
30390,">and has had a more lasting impact, than Alexander.

Don't underestimate the impact of Alexander's conquests. He brought Greek influence to a countless amount of civilizations and people, from Greece and Makedonia all the way to India. Ideas flowed from West to East, then back. The fusion of cultures was amazing and, I believe, unprecedented. 

Caesar's conquests certainly didn't have such a lasting impact."
30391,"Yea Genghis was pretty awesome.... and his ""genocide"" is sort of debated.  The thing is, when he invaded cities... after getting in, he would find the leaders and aristocrats (which at that time included historians) and would kill them in public so they didn't have to waste their energy on trying to beat the general population into submission.  Killing a lot of historians = historians being scared shitless of the horde and writing horrible things about them."
30392,"Probably just because I'm a kiwi, but:

The New Zealand Wars.

The British Empire sent large numbers of it's elite soldiery, armed with high-tech weaponry against ""the natives"", from about 1843 to about 1870.

The locals, with no full-time army, adapted quicker then Empire could have imagined, creating disposable death-trap fortifications, impervious to cannons and rockets,  employing tactics and strategies that would be themselves be adapted by the British in Crimea and WWI.

""One authority calculated that Gate Pa absorbed in one day a greater weight of explosives per square metre than did the German trenches in the week-long bombardment leading up to the Battle of the Somme.""

The Maori tribes were never really collectively defeated. The outcome was far from a simple conquest. The Tribes won many battles. Sometimes most of them on some campiagns. Ultimatly they won their rights on the battlefield."
30393,Plus the battle where the British ran out of bullets and what happened next...
30395,"In stark contrast to the Aztecs...

I wish I could watch a documentary on this."
30396,The Aztecs had the misfortune of being one of the few peoples who were more superstitious than Catholics.
30397,"Yes - the contrast could not be more stark.

The settlers were dependant on the Maori from the moment they arrived.
The Maori adapted very quickly.
By the time that tensions rose enough for a battle between the settlers and the Maori, the Maori had become veterans of modern warfare.
There was only one battle between settlers and Maori. The settlers came off very badly. So in the future, they had to use the Imperial Army.

From what I know, the descendants of the Aztecs lived under terribly oppressive conditions under their Empire. (Maybe they still do?)
Here, there were and are injustices. But they are nowhere near as great.

There is actually a fantastic documentary series.
The New Zealand Wars, based on and narrated by James Belich.

If you are lucky, somebody will have chopped it up into parts and put it on youtube. There is probably a torrent available too."
30399,"The Napoleonic Wars; causes, conduct, and consequences, along with investigation into the major players, technology, and side-theatres of the conflict.  

1793-1815 is a super-interesting time in world history.  Britain's at the top of her game, the French are actually WINNING BATTLES (I cringe saying this), and we've got fucking muskets, rockets, and the goddamn Royal Navy.

I'm a bit of an Anglophile, as all of my grandparents are English-born, and I had an ancestor at Trafalgar.  Therefore, I'm most interested in the Peninsular Wars and the naval theatres.  They're so exciting.  We've got guerilla warfare, spy games, massive stand-up battles, bloody sieges, rogues, heroes, and cowards.  Wellington, Picton, Crauford, Cochrane, and Nelson are all fascinating people to study. 

To a lesser (but still considerable) degree, I've studied the other side.  Massena, Ney, Napoleon (and his slutty wife and crazy brother) are all worth looking up. The Russian, Prussian, and Spanish are all worth looking up.  Portugese were the unsung heroes/whipping boys of the whole mess, and just look up Dancing Billy the Orange for a lesson in bad generalship.

Fictionally, the era is well supported as well.  Most of it is written from a British point of view, however.  Horatio Hornblower is a fantastic naval read, and every one of the titles is good.  So's O'Brien's Jack Aubrey. Both of those series are filled with technical details, interaction with real historical figures, and explanations of the political situations, worked right into the text.

To a lesser degree, we've got Bolitho, Drinkwater, and a slew of others.  Most of these series are ""meh"", and degrade as the series progresses.  

Finally, the elephant in the room:  Bernard Cornwell's captain Richard Sharpe.  His books are the womens' romance novel equivalent of historical fiction.  If you read them, start off with Sharpe's Eagle, and continue in the order they were PUBLISHED, not the order of the series.  His writing is pretty good in the beginning, but after the first 9 or so you start to see that they're formulaic, with shitty supporting characters and predictable endings.  They're what I'd give a 13 year old who wanted to get into reading.  They're fun and visceral to begin with (and do a little teaching), but you don't get much out of them.

If you want a list of non-fiction reads you should be checking out, PM me.  I'd be glad to pass my history-nerd knowledge on to someone."

Well, there is *War & Peace*..."
30401,"Spanish Civil War. Study this if you have the slightest distaste for government, fascism, corporatism, oligarchy, etc. The truth of what happened is incredibly different from what the revised history we are taught.

The Anarchists fought the Nazis before anyone else on the planet.

They proved Anarchism could work, if we made an actual effort. Now, mind you, detractors will say 'but the Anarchists lost'. And that's not what I mean. They did lose, against Stalinists who betrayed them, Fascists who bombed civilians, and overwhelming odds.

But before that happened, they dropped the crime rate in areas they controlled. They equalized women. They coordinated massive health care and labour reforms without any government structure.

Standards of living, education and health went up in the areas they controlled. The Spanish Civil War was 'The Good Fight'. The war of Hemingway and Orwell. It was a war for freedom, for the belief and love of freedom.

All of humanity lost."
30402,"An interesting war involving America was the [First Barbary War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War). It's pretty obscure, but also interesting."
30403,"Isn't that in the Marine's song to this day? ""From the coasts of Barbary"" (to the halls of Montezuma? maybe) or something similar..."
30404,"I believe it goes ""From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli"", but yes, that's where the line in the Marine Hymn comes from."
30405,"""Halls of Montezuma"" refers to the Mexican-American War's Battle of Chapultepec, where a force of marines stormed Chapultepec Castle.

""Shores of Tripoli"" specifically refers to the Battle of Derne, the first (of very many!) overseas land battles fought by the US.  A detachment of marines led a mercenary army against the Barbary state of Tripoli during the First Barbary War."
30406,Thanks! not a common song in Australia...
30407,"No worries.  For further reading on the Barbary Wars, I suggest picking up a copy of Six Frigates.  It details the beginning years of the U.S. Navy from the 1780's through The War of 1812.  It's a very well researched book and I highly recommend it."
30408,"Especially since they were the best boats on the water, combining French speed with the British ability to carry more weight"
30409,I've always been fascinated by Chinese culture and history. One of my favorite wars to learn about was the Opium Wars. One of the first times English military supremacy met the vast Chinese kingdom which had never had a serious opponent to that point. Also very interesting comparing capitalism vs. China's autonomous economy.
30410,"The First Word War: Not only are the battles interesting, the ramifications of what happened afterward: Destruction of the European Fuedal System, The Communist Revolution in Russia, Fascism in Italy and Germany, the Second World War.  I think all of it is fascinating."
30411,WWI has to be one of the blackest spots in the history of our civilization.  The events leading up to the War are just as interesting as the aftermath imo.
30412,The treaty of Versailles was a bad idea. The Marshall Plan was how it should have been handled from the beginning.
30413,"Add to that that a negotiated peace was probably a bad idea. It allowed for the ""stab in the back"" myth that fuelled the resent that lead to the rise of the Nazis.

At the end of WWII the allies were concious of that mistake. This is why they pressed an unconditional surrender upon Germany."
30414,"I always felt the difference that made the biggest effect was that they didn't tax the fuck out of Germany the second time. Because the Treaty of Versailles demanded Germany pay back Europe, inflation rose to the point where it was cheaper to burn your money than to buy firewood. 1 us dollar to 1 billion marks. It was ridiculous, and one can only expect for the people to be angered and want to get back some money by getting back some of their land. This Europe thought was fine for a bit, but then Germany got too greedy, and they drew this unexpected line at Poland. Germany didn't expect Europe to react as intense as they did with Poland (since they hadn't done anything before that when they were taking stuff over) and so were a tad surprised when a world war broke out again. 
All in all, pretty much everyone made terrible mistakes after WWI


Edit: Also, I thought it was really unfair that Germany got so much blame for the first world war, when they didnt' even start it. It seemed to me like Europe used Germany as a scape goat to try and recover for the war"

30422,"The royal we, of course."
30423,I cannot underscore enough how amazingly well Ken Burns' The Civil War is done.  Phenomenal piece.
30424,"The carnage was largely the result of this war being one of the first to ""benefit"" from the Industrial Revolution.  Improved gunnery led to incredibly horrific results when combined with direct assaults.  General Longstreet was smart to consider the defensive methods, particularly trench warfare, but that was not ""acceptable"" because it appeared cowardly.

Consequently, when WWI broke out, these tactics were not initially employed.  The advent of machine guns (firstly the Gatling gun) changed all that.

It is also why Hitler's Panzers shocked the world with their *blitzkreig* strategy.  After the bogged-down situation of WWI, it was widely understood that defensive warfare would win out over any kind of fire-and-movement.  As a result, the French were convinced their Maginot Line would stop any German assault.  When Poland fell to Germany in little more than a month, it heralded a new technology to trump the ""old-new"" technology, that of tanks over machine guns."
30425,"It was also one of the first ideological wars. Most wars up to this point were not about populations in direct opposition to each other ideologically, but between kings with private armies. There were a few superseding this (to some degree Napoleon) but, going back to your point, they did not benefit from the Industrial Revolution."
30426,"Just want to add to some of your points:

The tactics of the Civil War were basically Napoleonic in nature (less massed cavalry used for shock effect) with weapons that made the tactics obsolete.  Every soldier on both sides during the Civil War was armed with a rifle that was accurate to 300 meters or beyond.  Smoothbore muskets are good out to 80 meters or so, hence the need for massed volleys to hit anything.  

Rifles were in use as early as 1805, but only employed by specialized troops.  The British Brown Bess could be loaded and fired at least three times a minute (faster by better trained/experienced troops), but it's a smoothbore firing a round ball.  The Baker Rifle, on the other hand, could only be fired once a minute because of the greased leather patch needed to insure the lands in the barrel gripped the ball.  It was a bitch to ram the ball down the rifled barrel, especially if the barrel was fouled by previous shots fired.  The advantage of the Baker Rifle was it's accuracy - you can easily hit a man sized target 200-300 meters away.  This lead to the Baker Rifle being used for specialized troops - skirmishers who would pick off Officers and NCOs to sow confusion in the ranks.  When the fighting got serious, the Riflemen would just ram the ball and a regular patch down the barrel - much faster, but not appreciably more accurate than a regular musket.  If you're fighting like this, the only way that makes sense is to get a whole bunch of your buddies together, line up, and get real close to the people you're trying to kill.  If you fire in volley, you'll hit a few.  The side that loads and shoots fastest wins, unless some whackjob has the huevos to try a bayonet charge.

By the time the Civil War rolled around, the US Army had adopted something called the Minié ball.  This projectile was conical with a hemispherical cup in the base.  The projectile is slightly smaller than the bore of the musket, which allows it to be rammed down even the foulest of barrels with ease.  Due to the hemispherical base, when the powder charge ignites, the base of the Minié ball expands, gripping the rifling and reducing windage (in this case, windage refers to the didtance between the bore and the projectile, not an aiming term).  Widespread use of rifled muskets and Minie ball ammunition meand that every single soldier can kill accurately at distances of 300 or more meters without sacrificing rate of fire, and volley fire is lethal at much greater range, simply due to probability.  The machinery of war had far outstripped the tactics.

With regard to WWII:

The key to the German's success was in coordination and communication.  The French at the time had the best tanks on the battlefield.  The Char-B1 tank outclassed any tank the Germans had.  Unfortunately for the French, most did not have radios, and they were also spread out to give the Infantry support.  The Germans had far more radios, and also massed their armor (Schwerpunkt) to give local superiority.

Bah - I'm rambling again.  Sorry 'bout that."
30427,"The progression of violence from a planned picnic to trench warfare and civilian targeted mass destruction. If you've never read anything on the Civil War - start with April 1865: The Month That Saved America by Jay Winik.

What I find one of the saddest aspects of the Civil War is that the lessons learned were ignored... And those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The of the 'planners' and participants did not apply the lessons of what warfare had become in American Civil War to the Great War -- until thousands upon thousands of men were slaughtered and butchered. They just figured the Americans were savages and the Europeans would never fight that way. How damn wrong they were."
30428,"> If you've never read anything on the Civil War - start with April 1865: The Month That Saved America by Jay Winik.

I'm not saying that book isn't wonderful but to start learning about the Civil War starting with the last few months of the conflict seems to be the wrong way of going about it."
30429,i would start with 'battle cry of freedom' by james mcpherson
30430,"Without a doubt this is my favorite war to read about.  The issues were extremely complex and the personalities were so interesting.  

It's also very depressing."
30431,Plus the beards were *amazing*.
30432,I once fell asleep while browsing a giant coffee table photo book of the Civil War and dreamed about moustaches.
30433,"I like reading about Lincoln. The more I learn, the more I like the guy"
30434,I like you too.
30435,"Oh, STFU. *bang*"
30436,I think you were supposed to say something about Tyrany in Latin.

30438,Semper Fidelus Tyrannosaurus!
30439,"The Burns documentary is fine, but if you're truly interested in learning about the Civil War and Reconstruction (which I find far more interesting than the war itself) check out David Blight's lectures on Open Yale Courseware.

It's essentially like taking a course at Yale from one of the most prominent Civil War scholars without the tens of thousands in tuition. I can't recommend this series enough, you'd have to spend hundreds and read for months to get the kind of knowledge blight gives in only 20+ for absolutely free.

30440,the american civil war is one of the most fascinating conflicts of history. it happened at a time in history when antiquity and modernity were coming to a clash. this was that clash. you could probably spend a lifetime reading about the civil war and still find things interesting.
30441,"Both Roman triumvirates, the French Revolution, and I'm a sucker for early American History. Benjamin Fucking Franklin."
30442,Ben Franklin did really [love the ladies](http://www.wanderings.net/notebook/Main/BenjaminFranklinAdviceOnChoiceOfAMistress)
30443,"I've come across that selection a few times, and it never ceases to amaze me. 

Basically, one of the founding fathers was a super hornball (So was the slave-banging Jefferson).  I love how his thoughts boil down to this:

""Fuck older women and fat chicks, because they're smarter and try harder."""
30444,"Yeah, Benjamin Fucking Franklin was a pretty interesting war."
30445,"i think WW2 is the most interesting. So much crazy shit happened. I can watch WW2 movies, tv shows and documentaries all day long!"
30446,"I agree, and I have spent endless hours reading various websites and wikipedia articles. WW2 has all : great battles, so many technological advances, great drama too.

However I have read and seen so much about WW2 that I almost read the OP's message as ""Which war is interesting besides WW2?"""
30447,"Studying war in isolation doesn't really tell you very much, beyond incremental tactical innovations. (I say this as a graduate of a War Studies program.) I think the far more interesting thing is to study the aftermath of wars--peace settlements, negotiations, etc. They tell you at least as much about who ""won"" than anything that happened on the battlefield.  And in many cases, they lay the groundwork for the war that follows."
30448,"Not that it was a specific war but Emperor Justinian's reign is pretty fascinating to me. He so nearly managed to save the Roman Empire and hold it all together but in the end Justinian was truly Roman. Belisarius. Theodora. Antonina. All the intrigue, moral corruption, heroism and tragedy anyone could ask for all wrapped up in one epic reign. Shakespeare couldn't script it any better.

Yeah, give me a week in Constantinople circa 535."
30449,"I'm fascinated by the short transition period RIGHT after WW2 in Berlin.  Russians got there, US got there, the soldiers partied together cuz the defeater Hitler, then they had the awkward ""wait, you're a communist/capitalist"" conversation then the Cold War began."
30450,"You may enjoy John Lewis Gaddis' ""The Cold War: A New History."" The beginning chapters show that the tension between the two armies was present long before the end of the war, and the author's thesis about the importance of ""ordinary people"" over political leaders in terms of influence is very intriguing.

Of course, it wasn't always like that. If you're interested in the military side of things, the prolific historian John Keegan's ""Six Armies at Normandy"" shows that it was actually American and Soviet leaders who agreed the most on strategy, with Britain usually being the odd one out. The narratives Keegan gives in that book are really powerful, particularly the daring parachute drop before Normandy."
30451,"The Canadian theatre of the 7 years war was huge in establishing the English/French dynamic of the country that continues, to a degree, to this day."
30452,"Im working on my doctorate in history... (soon.. when i have money again.. sigh)

WW1 is for me one of the most fascinating periods of war in the world, the ground war is a horribly depressing thing, and that is well covered, but few people know much about the war at sea, which is actually very fascinating, if you are interested, Robert K Massey wrote two excellent books about it, and they are an excellent intro into the period:

Dreadnought, which covers the pre-war arms race, and is very well written, its the book i recommend to non-history people to get them started, as its very accesible but also accurate, http://www.amazon.com/Dreadnought-Robert-K-Massie/dp/0345375564/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t

Castles of Steel, which covers the war period itself, and the actions of the british navy, again, exceedingly well written, and very accesible, it reads liek a novel, and exposes the personalities that commanded both the german and british fleets. 
http://www.amazon.com/Castles-Steel-Britain-Germany-Winning/dp/0345408780/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281112593&sr=1-1

(My master's thesis was inspired by Massey, i covered the SMS Goeben and the repercusions of her entry into the bosporus, which precipitated events that caused the fall of the ottoman empire...)

For WW2 stuff, most of everything is well covered, if you want something little known about, and well, frankly a bit depressing, pick up:

The 900 Days, the siege of Leningrad by Harrison Salisbury, it covers a 3 year period few int he west know too much about, and its a very vivid telling of not only the conduct of the siege itself, but the deprivations the inhabitants of the city suffered, i had the misfortune of reading this book in the winter, and as tacky as it sounds, every time i stepped out to catch the train when i was reading this book, and dealt with the boston winters, i just felt a wave of distress, recalling what i had read in the book, its weird to describe it.

Last thing i will recommend, is, if you are at all interested in the american civil war, i would highly recommend Battlecry of freedom, by James McPherson, I know everyone and their mother LOVES ken burns and the civil war and it is excellent.............. but its unfortunately not terribly accurate, one of my professor is a civil war expert and took our class through the documentary, and we found something like 1 factual error every 2-3 minutes. Battlecry is more modern, and very well researched and written.

quick edit:

http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Power-Upon-History-1660-1783/dp/0486255093

Alfred Thayer Mahan's Influence of seapower is credited repeatedly as one of the most influential, yet least known books in history, it practically caused WW1, and was a bible to progressive minds in the British royal navy, and the German imperial navy, its also credited by ww2 us admirals, Yamamoto himself  studied it extensively, and i think its still required reading at Annapolis.


Long Edit now that im off work, and im in front of my library, i wont go into as much detail for the sake of brevity, but these are all quite good, these are the accessible ones... most of my library is very very technical or difficult stuff. (my apologies to the non-euro centric people, i am actually fascinated by the Mughal Empire in india, and the three kingdoms period of chinese history, but both scholarly and common works seem to be rare in english, spanish, german, or anything else i can read in :(  if someone who sees this has any recommendation, i would love to hear them)

WW2 era:

http://www.amazon.com/Alamo-Ardennes-American-Soldiers-Bastogne/dp/0471739057
excellent look at the overall battle, and a good look at alot of the units that are often overlooked (IE non paras)

http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Britain-Greatest-Air-World/dp/039302766X
overview of the battle of britain, a little on the technical side, but very good overall

http://www.amazon.com/Lose-Battle-France-1940/dp/0140134301
why the French got kicked in ww2, its actually a really fascinating story, and quite demonstrative of what bad management can do.

inter-war:

http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Fear-American-Depression-1929-1945/dp/0195038347
this book is almost un-explainable how good it is, and how comprehensive, fair warning, it is beyond massive in scope, but it is crucial to understanding america during the interwar and ww2 years.

Korea:

http://www.amazon.com/Korean-War-Da-Capo-Paperback/dp/0306802678
excellent book by general ridgeway, good for looking at command level thinking (biased of course, but not too badly)

30453,"I quote Bart Simpson: ""There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy"""
30454,"The most interesting? Oh, no debate at all. 

[The Taiping Rebellion](http://wsu.edu/~dee/CHING/TAIPING.HTM). 

Excerpts from that page: 

> In the Taiping rebellion alone, which lasted for twenty years, almost twenty to thirty million died as a direct result of the conflict. In fact, the period from 1850 to 1873 saw, as a result of rebellion, drought, and famine, the population of China drop by over sixty million people.

....
>Hung Hsiu-ch'üan was the son of a poor farmer near Canton. He was a promising young student, but repeatedly failed the civil service examination in Canton. After one such failure, he overheard a Christian missionary speaking and brought home several Christian treatises. The next year he again failed the exam and, according to some historians, had a nervous breakdown. Whatever happened, Hung had several visions in which an old man told him that people had stopped worshipping him and were worshipping demons; in another, the man appointed him as a slayer of demons. Hung believed that the man in the visions was God the Father and that a younger, middle aged man that visited him in visions was Jesus Christ, his Elder Brother. 

....
> The movement attracted followers for a variety of reasons. Western historians argue that the famines of the 1840's inspired the Chinese to join various movements that were successfully feeding and taking care of themselves. Chinese historians stress the anti-Manchu rhetoric of Hung's early movement. While the God Worshippers were dedicated to the destruction of idols and the stamping out of demon worship, it's clear that they felt that the Manchu rulers were the primary propagators of demon worship. In Hung's early philosophy, he seems to have arrived at the conclusion that the overthrow of the Manchus would help bring in the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. 

....
> The army itself was uncannily disciplined; after elaborate initiation rituals, Taiping believers became fanatically disciplined and devoted soldiers, willing to die without hesitation in God's cause against demonic forces. The army of the Taipings roared northward through the central Yangtze valley to Nanking.

....
> Believing that the Heavenly King should rule only by his divine virtue and not by active engagement in politics, Hung seems, in reality, to have grown steadily more unbalanced. Rather than dedicating himself to divine virtue, he plunged into the sensual pleasures of the palace and the sexual pleasures of the harem of women he had collected around himself. Hung's withdrawal from Taiping administration sent cracks all through the Taiping administration. 


This is why the current Chinese government is so hard on wacky sects like Falun Gong. 

tl;dr - Farm boy fails civil service exam 7 times, has nervous breakdown in which Jesus appears to him and says, ""You're my little brother, kick out these idolators."" He raises army, nearly overthrows China's emperor, but fails because he spends too much time getting sexed up by his harem."
30455,"From WWI: read up on the Battle of Verdun. A valuable lesson for anyone who buys into the whole ""the French are pussies"" line.

From WWII: Battle of Kursk. If you like tank warfare, this battle is a must to study."
30456,the crusades are pretty badass
30457,"Agree, but not so much because of their badassery, but because of how fascinating that period of history is. And also the ramifications of the crusades are still playing out today."
30458,"to be fair, most of the badassery is on the islamic side."
30459,"I like the crusades because there was so much culture exchange. This was more notable in that it brought a lot of Islamic art and culture to england, also knowledge and goods, etc etc"
30460,My favorite was the Children's Crusade.
30461,"I always loved learning about the Revolutionary War. I would love to travel back in time to 1760s and 17770s. It was such a desperate war, and one that we probably shouldn't have won, considering the odds."
30462,"No love for the 30 year war? Great leaders; military innovation; massive carnage, with entire cities depopulated; religious ideology mixed with cynical realpolitik, with sinister French clerics manipulating other players to prolong the carnage and pave the way for France's rise; a settlement which not only changed the balance of power and redrew the borders of Europe, but redefined the meaning of the state. Plenty of wars outside Europe too."
30463,"I imagine part of it is the fact that the war is can be a bit confusing. Keeping track of all the differing participants and, in some cases, what side they happened to be fighting for isn't easy. On top of that, there were so many motives for fighting. One has to accept that this wasn't just a religious war or a spat between empires, a power-grab &c. I found, when reading about the war, that I needed to read as if the book were a novel - keeping track of multiple plots and characters - rather than just a retelling of the facts. 

That being said, I do find the war an interesting one, precisely because of its esoteric nature - though not the most interesting, for me that would probably be WWI, largely because of the literature during and after the war by those actually fighting, I'm a sucker for knowing about how people experienced wars."
30464,"Not really related to the topic, but just something that I've been thinking about for a while.

Visit a Reddit thread about Iraq or Afghanistan, and you'll see comments along the lines of ""War is horrible, stop it now, bring everyone home"", which is a totally reasonable point of view and something I can agree with.

But then visit this thread and it's filled with things like, ""Oh man, this one war was so bad ass! It's so interesting and cool etc..."" 

Am I the only one who sees a disconnect here? Is war still cool, but only in abstract? Or am I rambling and not making sense.

EDIT: As for the topic, I honestly can't wait to see a true, legitimate historical treatment of the War on Terror in forty years. Once we can get away from the politics of it all and focus on the actual war fighting, I think it'll make some fascinating history."
30465,"The viking age.

That shit is thoroughly interesting."
30466,Vietnam. Read Chickenhawk by Robert Mason. You will not be disappointed.
30467,"I'll have to agree with this.  Vietnam, being an ""unpopular"" war, is absolutely fascinating.  The politics, the subterfuge, the near inabiltiy of the US to goad the North into set-piece battles, the control of information and the intentional disemination of misinformation... it's incredible stuff.  In addition to the aforementioned Chickenhawk, I highly recommend Appy's [Working Class War: American Soldiers in Vietnam](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Class-War-American-Soldiers-Vietnam/dp/0807843911/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281107759&sr=8-1) and [Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides](http://www.amazon.com/Patriots-Vietnam-War-Remembered-Sides/dp/0142004499/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281107832&sr=1-1)."
30468,"Peloponese War (Sparta & allies vs. Athens & allies). Incredible long, hard fought war. However the 80 year long war between Spain and the Netherlands was no weekend skirmish either.

Finally I have always been very fascinated by Venice. A Republic/oligarchy for a thousand years, with a focus on trade and profit, but no slouches at warfare either."
30469,The [War of the Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses). That thing is confusing as hell. Bonus: Final Fantasy Tactics is based on it. The remake is even called Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions.
30470,"As an Anglophile I find the War of the Roses facinating.

Simply for obscurity and it being the only historical event of national importance in my state: The Pig War."
30471,"Later Han Turmoil/Three Kingdoms period. It's like a diplomacy/""shimo"" style free-for-all where everyone else speaks the same language/culture. So many people defect/surrender and fight for another side - this rarely happens in the international multilingual wars we read about. Probably largely since China is the largest country with a relatively homogeneous culture+written language (and so can support that many groups).

Of course, there are other periods that might be somewhat similar - the Sengoku period of Japan comes to mind in particular, as do the Warring States period/Spring and Autumn period, but the literature/video games of those periods (especially those available in English) number far less than the literature/video games of the Three Kingdoms era. The Chu-Han contention is also quite fascinating, although on a much smaller scale."
30472,"Upvoting this. Unfortunately the Three Kingdoms period has such a place in the romanticization of Ancient Chinese history that few ordinary Chinese these days are able to tell what is historical fact from what is the fiction that Luo Guanzhong novelized. 

This war involved so many people and such a large swath of land and resources that it's very telling of all of Chinese history--I feel that a lot of the reasons the Han broke up and the wars began is repeated throughout Chinese history with the fall of each dynasty. If you really grok Three Kingdoms, you really do grok a large chunk of the history of Chinese wars."
30473,"Polish – Soviet War 

I think Reddit will like this one too. I took place right after the WW I. It has been only one year since Poland regained it's independence and it had to defend against newly formed and bloodthirsty Red Army. Polish army was poorly equipped in compression to it's opponent. So we used our brains! A team of brilliant mathematicians managed to intercept and decrypt Soviet transmissions even faster then Soviets themselves. So we knew their every move and we won. 

Some historians say that if it weren't for us the Red Army would stop somewhere around France. Here are some links
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Soviet_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)"
30474,"Nice, so Poland started the war in Ukraine and then claimed they defended Europe against evil Soviets. Stay classy."
30475,"**Question:** as a non-American I've always found the Civil War inpenetrable.  
Can anyone suggest any documentaries or podcast series that will give me a good introduction?"
30476,"Ken Burns:  Civil War.  Pretty much the definitive documentary series on the civil war.  In fact, anything by Ken Burns is fantastic."
30477,Ken Burns' Civil War documentary is great. And apparently someone uploaded all of it to google video [(link)](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8374525609478249503&hl=en).
30478,"Favorite war ATM: (Not really a war I guess) Invasion of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson almost won...almost. He fuckin' had to beat off two invading armies at once, without the support of any other country or the Papacy, and he came within one cavalry charge of victory. 

Read 1066, it's an awesome book with tons of information. I learned a lot about the misconceptions surrounding the Norman invasion."
30479,"[Kalinga War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalinga_War)

Fought in 265 BC, had more than 100,000 casualties. But the war also converted a ruthless emperor into the flag bearer of peace. And it gave the Indian subcontinent its ""favorite weapon"" Non-violence."
30480,"The world wars are interesting because most of the narrative is bullshit. For example, we're told Germany invaded Poland to start WW2, but this ignores how the Austrian-Hungarian empire was parcelled at the end of WW1, including the very part that Germany invaded (Danzig corridor). When Russia invaded Poland soon after, neither France nor England declared war on them also. All of Germany's ""invasions"" were reuniting the Austrian-Hungarian empire, or for preventing the continental landing by the British. This is why they took Norway, north France (not South), Belgium and Norway (not Sweden nor Finland). Same with Saddam Hussein's ""invasion"" of Kuwait. Kuwait and Iraq had been part of the Ottoman empire until WW1 parcelled it up. 100 years later and Bush's extension of England's wars to maintain world domination are still at work.

Churchill began blitzkrieg bombing civilian German areas *before* Germany ever did, and on the very next day after he took office. 10x as many German civilians were killed in blitzkrieg bombing than English civilians.

Jesse Owens was never snubbed by Hitler, and said in his autobiography that Hitler rose and waved at him.

Victors write history. I'm not defending the Nazis, but a hell of a lot of facts about history are buried to create a fictional good/evil dichotomy. However, after the war, Churchill did say ""we slaughtered the wrong pig"". It's never much acknowledged that National Socialism arose primarily as a reaction to Communism, it's extent of power intended to match it so Germany itself would not be overtaken by Communists, as it was directly after the war."
30481,"Favourite war: Invasion of Britain by the Romans, but there isn't that much information on it

Ergo, most interesting war to read about: [Caesar's Gallic Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars).  In his own words, detailed about the action but also the tribes he encountered.  Fascinating.  The following [Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Civili) is also very interesting."

30495,"Also Conflict in Mexico. But A Glorious Defeat is a really great read, 10/10 would.

30500,*Ancient Mexico & Central America: Archaeology and Culture History* by Susan Toby Evans and *Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs* by Michael Coe are good basic introductions to ancient Mexico.
30501,"I would recommend Mexico and the Spanish Conquest by Ross Hassig. Not a huge read, but extremely comprehensive."
30502,*The Development of Mexican Identity* by Manuel Isaías López is fascinating historical analysis from a psychological  point of view.
30503,"There are a ton of books, but movies too. Here are two books and three movies that all do a great job with Mexico's history.

My favorite book on the Aztecs is *Daily Life of the Aztecs on the Eve of the Spanish Conquest* by Jacques Soustelle.

On the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, nothing beats reading the original letters of Hernan Cortes written to the king back in Spain. The English translation is excellent and the editor's/translator's notes correct many of Cortes' mistakes/exaggerations/lies. The English title is *Letters from Mexico* by Hernan Cortes.

If you have Netflix, I highly recommend the documentary *Patria*, dealing with the 1850s-60s, including the presidency of Santa Anna, the liberal/conservative civil war, the presidency of Benito Juarez and the French invasion.

On youtube, you can learn about the Mexican Revolution of 1910-20, as well as its precursors and aftermath, in the 2-hour documentary *The Storm that Swept Mexico*, which includes amazing archival work, painstaking film restoration and interviews with some of the leading historians on early 20th century Mexican history.

Regarding more recent issues, the disappearance of the 43 students is dealt with on Netfilx in the documentary *43*, which I also recommend."
30504,"The catalyst for the war came over a border dispute. The U.S. put the Texas border at the Rio Grande, something it had been pushing since the Louisiana purchase. Mexico was going by maps based on Spanish colonial maps, putting the border at the Nueces River. President Polk orders the Army to set up at the Rio Grande (present day Brownsville, Texas) to protect the border. Mexico sees this as an invasion and sends the Army to intercept. Leading to the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. President Polk then goes to Congress and states that ""Mexico has spilled American blood on U.S. territory,"" and asked Congress to declare war."
30505,"The War was inevitable due to border clashes.  

Prior to the American Annexation of Texas; Mexico had invaded Texas at least 2 or 3 times and occupied San Antonio.  

Mexico was struggling with debts to European nations France and the UK. 

Mexico had long standing internal issues prior to the Mexican War and after it through 1919.

The results of the Mexican War contributed to the American Civil War and the South's desire to create more slave states to balance the union.

The American Military was able to decisively defeat the Mexican Army in almost every engagement due to superior leadership and weapon modernization.  The Americans used many modernized Rifled weapons and had more effective artillery."
30506,"I don't see Mexico as invading Texas, since at the time it was part of the whole country. Mexico didn't recognize Texas independence until after the Mexican-American War. I apologyse if it sounds like I'm splitting hairs, I'm just very passionate about this period in Texas History. But border Clashes were quite frequent. Texas actually attempted to invade Mexico Twice, The Tampico Expedition, and and invasion of New Mexico. Neither one turned out well for the Texans. It's amazing how this war influenced politics on both sides of the border for years to come. Not just the Civil War in the United States, but two civil Wars and the Revolution in Mexico as well."
30507,"Texas independence was recognized by Britain, France and the USA and even Spain .... Mexico crossing to seize back lost territories was invasion of a sovereign border.

When the USA annexed Mexico; the border clashes were no longer tolerated and to boot the US had its sights on expansion; the War with Mexico made logical sense even if consider the issues that plagued Mexico through 1919.

And the Mexican American War wouldn’t be Mexico’s last invasion from the USA or a foreign power."
30508,"Except Mexico did not recognize Texas independence, so it still saw itself as putting down a rebellion. After U.S. annexation it was actually Mexico that was invaded when American troops examples on the Rio Grande, since the Nueces River was the actual border."
30509,"A group of predominantly Irish and eastern Europe immigrants deserted from the U.S. army and joined Mexico. They had been treated poorly and discriminated against because they were Catholic. They saw themselves as having more in common with Mexico. They were known as the Saint Patrick's Battalion, and are celebrated in Mexico to this day."
30510,A number of them who were US citizens and we’re taken POW late in the war were executed in a mass hanging timed to coincide with the raising of the US flag over Chapultepec palace.
30511,"Well, obviously they committed treason, and the penalty is death. Some of the survivors took Spanish surnames and stayed. I read an article that during the occupation of Brownsville, Irish-Catholics would disguised themselves in Mexican clothing and cross the river into Matamoros on Sundays to attend mass."
30512,"so if we use your logic North Korea would be justified by invading South Korea because it doesn’t recognize South Korea as a state or for that matter China could invade Taiwan because Taiwan’s independence is not recognized ..... ....

Texas was established under the Mexican Constitution of 1826; that was relinquished by the Mexican military who then tried to remove Texan colonialist who were Mexican citizens; Texas Had every right to secede from Mexico; and they did and won independence. 

Mexico’s choice to invade the Texas republic to reclaim it was done so with international protests from the USA, UK, France and Spain who all recognized Texas Independence.

Mexico’s internal struggles politically and financially were just as much to blame for Mexican American War as much as manifest destiny took their territories; this went on until 1919."
30513,As U.S. Grant said. The most unjust war fostered by a powerful nation. Upon a weak one
30514,"This is simply not true; especially if you're thinking of Mexico and the United States in today's context of class and status. 

American was only 63 years old in 1846 and was not even close to be described as a powerful state. 

The difference was that the United States was a healthier nation and able to mobilize an efficient military whitest Mexico was not due to internal issues.

Otherwise, neither country was considered 'more powerful than the other'.  

The British and French had speculated heavily on supporting Mexico in defeating the USA; the USA had no international support for the War. 

US president Grant was inspired by the War; as were other Generals Lee, Taylor, Scott and Davis. 

If the USA had invaded Mexico today to take control of the border then your argument might make sense."
30515,"In terms of the size of each country's standing army, both were pretty even. As you mentioned, the U.S. was a healthier nation, and much more industrialized. During the colonial period, Spain did not do much to industrialize itself, mainly because of all the wealth the colonies were producing, it could simply buy manufactured goods. Also, it didn't want industrialization in the colonies, fearing that was the reason the English Colonies had managed to successfully break from England. Another problem was the way the military was ran in Mexico. It still used the Spanish custom of buying commissions, or being given one simply because of family status. By this time most of the senior officers who had any formal experience had retired, since they were veterans of the wars for independence. General Santaanna tried to fix this by awarding comissions and promotions based on merit. Unfortunately the process is slow, and he couldn't transform Mexico's Military in time to contend against the United States."
30516,"Neither country was really much to speak of in 1846; the United States mustered a decent army and navy which was also a show of force to the U.K. and France.

I don’t think Mexico could have won the war however they could have made it difficult for the USA had they won a battle or two and then British military and naval support which was on the table."
30517,Read his autobiography.
30518,"I did read it; the American war against Mexico was war over spoils and conquest of territories.  That’s way of 18th century post colonial North America; has nothing to do with a nation bullying the other.  

You should also read Winfield Scott’s and Zachary Taylor’s bios ...."
30519,Then you know that's what he said.
30520,"He said much more; you’re only using one line to support an argument.  

Grant said the following .... “I’m opposed to the war as it would bring in new slave supporting territories; in opposing the measure felt the war was unjustifiable” 

However he also went on to write that subsequent Union victory in the civil war admonished the Mexican secession.  

Grant would go on to lead the industrialization of those lands he felt were so wrongly acquired..... lining his coffers. 

One fact remains he benefited from two North American Wars; without those wars .... he’s a drunk and a debtor."
30521,It is an armed conflict that happened between the two countries as a result of many struggles between the US. and Mexico
30522,"After their defeat, Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and ceded much of what is today the southwestern United States to the US. This act became known as the Mexican Cession. 

Edit: added details"
30523,"I have no complaints about the execution of captured US-citizen San Patricios by the USA.

I’ve read that later Mexican general/warlord/revolutionary president Obregon was descended from an Irishman named O’Brian."
30524,You are correct. The family changed the name to sound more Hispanic and blend in. Interesting since he is arguably the best military mind ever to come out of Mexico.
30525,"How much it is mentioned in schools will vary depending on the state. 

Here in California we probably touch on the war more than in say, Maine, as it directly affected California history quite a bit. I know it was brought up when I was in the 5th grade, as the focus of History class was California history. We briefly touched on it in US history in both 8th and 10th grades."
30526,"As a high school student who just took AP US History last year, I feel qualified to answer the second part of your question. 

As part of our studies of American ""Manifest Destiny"" sentiment and pre-Civil War state relations, we studied the Mexican-American War in some detail (or at least the political side of it). If you are unfamiliar with AP, they are a series of tests offered by the College Board to High School students and a high score on a test can often earn you college credit in a comparable area of study. As you can imagine, there is much more rigor in these classes than there would be in a standard high school US History class and this deters many students from taking the AP version. It is my understanding that the standard US History class at my school did not go over the Mexican-American War at all since they start their studies in the Reconstruction (Post-Civil War, 1870's-ish) era.

As for your main question:

The gist of what we learned is that the War was deliberately started by the Americans. Reasons being:

* The 1844 election of the Pro-Manifest Destiny and Pro-expansionary Polk led sitting President John Tyler to believe that there was a popular referendum in support of these goals and annexed Texas accordingly

* Annexing Texas would inevitably lead to conflict with Mexico since Mexico still maintained that Texas was Mexican territory despite the Texans having claimed independence for many years

* President Polk himself initiated a causus belli for the war in a Congressional Report that stated Mexican Soldiers had attacked American Soldiers on *American soil*. The Spot Resolutions of Abraham Lincoln, who was at the time a Representative from Illinois, challenged the claim and vehemently demanded to know the exact *spot* where the attack supposedly occurred. There is now strong reason to believe that Lincoln was correct (the attacks appear to have happened on disputed territory) and that Polk was deliberately attempting (successfully) to provoke anti-Mexican sentiment

* Polk, who was a true Son of the South, had great reason to pursue expansion and definitive annexation of Texas (both of which would be outcomes of the War, which we had little reason to believe we would lose). It was around this time that true tension between free and slave states was beginning because the tentative balance of power between them was being tested. This power was measured by the number of states in each category, since more states meant more votes in the all-important House of Representatives. This count was becoming dangerously close. If Texas, a would-be slave state, were admitted to the Union then power would be back in the hands of the slave states. Polk and his followers also believed that many of the other territories gained from the War would follow suit. 

Even though things did not work out *exactly* as planned (Texas and the New Mexico Territory voted to become a slave territory but California and the Utah Territory did not), the actions of the Southern Political Establishment, including Federal officeholders, after the War make it clear this was their main, if not only, goal. 

I do not know much about Mexican history, but taking all this into account, I find it hard to believe that it would be the Mexicans who are to blame for starting the War.

Edit: A word"
30527,"Wow I never knew that Mr. Lincoln debated the legitimacy of the declarations made by Polk about the attacks, to be honest I don't deny that they happened but I do question the fact it was done on US soil. Such a shame that more people didn't side with him, what a great man indeed may he rest in peace.

P.s: Thank you for the comment  and for the AP information."
30529,He is asking about the war between the United States and Mexico not the war for Texan independence.
30531,"Actually I would have to agree with Irishfafnir on this, yes the Texas secession hurt my country indeed but, in my personal opinion, when the president Polk ordered to the general Taylor to send troops beyond the Nueces river into the Rio Grande ignoring the warnings of my country he declared war. It is amazing how the relocation of a river can hurt a country so badly."
30532,"There is certainly a large school of thought that argues that Polk essentially engineered the war to acquire California. There is another school( that I think has declined) that argues was was inevitable when the  United States annexed Texas. I tend to be more sympathetic towards Polk, but there are historians who would disagree with me."
30533,"Have you read Battle Cry of Freedom? It contains a chapter specifically on the Mexican-American War as pretext for the Civil War. Although it's a large book (just under 1,000 pages) the Mexican-American War is woven in there frequently after that initial chapter.

The author does delve into military history form, but it's not quite his focus. Not sure if you're looking for information on specific battles, of which there is some, but this book has a bit of a wider view. 

I'm not sure if he covers the actions at Chapultepec extensively (has been about a year since I read it) but he does do an excellent job presenting the information of a battlefield.  

[link] (http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Cry-Freedom-Oxford-History/dp/019516895X)

So that's from what I can personally recommend, but doing a little snooping I've compiled a short list of possible options (I worked for two years in a new and used book store, so I feel I have a good eye for relevant books).

[-A campaign history, published by U of Kansas]
(http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2107695.A_Gallant_Little_Army)

[-Another campaign history, published by U of Oklahoma] 
(http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42533.So_Far_From_God)

The others I found were a bit questionable.  I can't find any published first-hand accounts from soldiers, which seems to have been much, much more common in the Civil War than in the Mexico campaign."
30534,"I just opened my copy of *Battle Cry of Freedom* and can verify that there is no coverage of Chapultapec. While he lightly touches on the strategy of the Mexican War, there is no discussion of the battles of that war, except insofar as they relate to the Civil War, whether it be in regard to participants, tactics, strategy, etc. Although a fantastic book, it's probably not a great for OP's purposes."
30535,"Yeah, you're correct, I just got home and took a look as well. He makes four mentions of Chapultepec but does not go into any detail as he does with the engagements of the Civil War unfortunately (one of these mentions is of Longstreet falling wounded with the colours, and Pickett taking them from him; it contains these sorts of details)."
30536,"The memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm

Also, you can search for West Point training manuals on Google books. They're almost all there. They showcase the tactics the superior American junior officer corps was trained in and used in the war against a very amateurish Mexican junior officer corps. Dennis Hart Mahan wrote several of them."
30537,"[This](http://www.history.vt.edu/MxAmWar/Newspapers/Niles/Nilesj1847NovDec.htm#NR73.184Nov.201847Gen.Winfield) has a number of primary sources, including Winfield Scott's official report for Chapultepec. [This](http://community.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Marines%20in%20the%20Mexican%20War%20%20PCN%2019000412200.pdf) is a paper with some good coverage of the Marines in that battle specifically. While much of the conclusions are outdated, Justin Smith's [*The War With Mexico*](http://www.amazon.com/The-With-Mexico-Justin-Smith/dp/0844614130) continues to be invaluable for its use of primary source material unavailable elsewhere. It is also available for free online, thanks to its age. 

More generally speaking, the best book to my knowledge detailing the military history of the Mexican War is K. Jack Bauer's [*The Mexican War, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mexican-1846-1848-Jack-Bauer/dp/0803261071). You may also find Robert Selph Henry's [The Story of the Mexican War](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0306803496?tag=thomacom-20) a good introduction. Focusing on the perspective of the American soldier is James M. Mccaffrey's [*Army of Manifest Destiny: The American Soldier in the Mexican War, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/Army-Manifest-Destiny-1846-1848-Experience/dp/0814755054). Richard Bruce Winder's [*Mr. Polk's Army: The American Military Experience in the Mexican War*](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Polks-Army-Experience-University/dp/1585440337) is, in many ways, similar and improved but has no discussion of Chapultepec specifically. /u/SnakeGD09's suggestion, John Eisenhower's [*So Far From God: The U. S. War With Mexico, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/So-Far-From-God-1846-1848/dp/0806132795) is not a campaign history but is a good and comprehensive general history. His evaluation of Winfield Scott is particularly valuable. A newer history of the war with great insights on the Mexican side is Timothy Hendersons's [*A Glorious Defeat: Mexico and Its War with the United States*](http://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Defeat-Mexico-United-States/dp/0809049678). Other books of interest on different aspects of the war, which may be more, less, or not at all useful, depending on what it is on which you decide to focus, include John H. Schroeder's important [*Mr. Polk's War: American Opposition and Dissent, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Polks-War-Opposition-1846-1848/dp/0299061604) and Robert W. Johannsen's [*To the Halls of the Montezumas: The Mexican War in the American Imagination*](http://www.amazon.com/To-Halls-Montezumas-American-Imagination/dp/0195049810/ref=cm_rdp_product). Also potentially useful is the first volume of Douglas Southall Freeman's [*R. E. Lee: A Biography*](http://www.amazon.com/R-E-Lee-Biography-Vol/dp/1931313369).

I am not familiar with /u/SnakeGD09's suggestion of [*A Gallant Little Army: The Mexico City Campaign*](http://www.amazon.com/Gallant-Little-Army-Campaign-Studies/dp/0700615415), but it looks like it is especially relevant to your paper and I've heard it is quite good."
30538,"Thank you so much for your help! I ended up using some of these, in addition to 10 or so books I was able to pull from the library. Good stuff!"
30539,"After WWII, the US mostly started wars when it felt threatened by the growing power of a particular enemy. There are always strong economic reasons, but if you just look at the general political context, the US has been trying to prevent a strong coalition in the USSR and in the Middle East. If the US let the USSR/China annex Vietnam and Korea, and expand unchecked, by the time the communist governments actually attacked the US directly it would probably be too late. This is the same logic that caused Great Britain to declare war when Germany invaded Poland in WWII. If your enemy is a dictatorship that is continuously accumulating power, you'll probably feel justified in attacking them before they become too powerful to defend against. So the only question about these wars is whether the potential threat was truly great enough. It was pretty much a no-brainer when it came to the invasion of Poland, but may have been more of an educated guess on the part of the US government when it came to Korea and Vietnam.

TL;DR Korean war and Vietnam war may be justified if put into the political and historical context of the Cold War"
30540,"There is a legit case to be made that Germany would have happily left western and northern Europe alone in WW2 (after all they wanted space and resources from inferior people, not highly populated cities full of hostile racial peers).

That being said, a Nazi Empire in control of Soviet territories would have potentially become a devastating problem once the Germanification was complete."
30541,I don't think Hitler's ego would have allowed him moderation in terms of expansion.
30542,"Yes, but the expansion would require time. After all, he wasn't building an Empire in the old school sense of the word: he was building a super nation-state.

Occupying area isn't enough, it needs to be Germanic. Preferably by being densely populated by Germans. If he could have taken over the Soviet Union and then conjured up 300 million extra Germans to populate it and Eastern Europe somehow, I'm sure he would have continued with the expansion. Alas, going from 100m to 400m population would have taken far longer than Hitlers lifespan.

Taking over more territory would have simply made Grossdeutchland more ""polluted""."
30543,"We provoked the Mexican army by having soldiers in debatable territory.  I'm not sure on your definition of justified, but I opine that the Mex-Am war was an act of imperial aggression."
30544,"Not exactly. Texas seceded from Mexico by war/treaty. Texas then expressed a desire to join the US. Mexico's Santa Anna got a case of ""treaty remorse"" and betrayed the Mexican government by assuming presidency and invaded Texas while declaring war on the US. The US then declared war on Mexico."
30545,"Many people had the same opinion at the time. I've always loved Ralph Waldo Emerson's pronouncement about the war:

""The United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as the man who swallows the arsenic which will bring him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.""

And it did, because the integration of Mexican territory into US states is what kicked off the series of crises that ultimately ended in the Civil War."
30546,"I've heard that cited quote cited before, but by a racist.  Not suggesting racism has anything to do with yourself or your comment, just noting that racists use that and other perfectly fine quotes with outlandish interpretations.

Edit ... derp"
30547,"Correct. The territory was in dispute where a few skirmishes allegedly occurred. We took those weak confrontations and amphibiously assaulted Mexico at Veracruz. Our first excursion, as a nation, onto foreign soil."
30548,"""From the Halls of Montezuma"" happened after ""To the shores of Tripoli""

Edit: I see now that you've explained your position in more detail. By magnitude the Mexican-American War definitely makes the Barbary Wars look like skirmishes."
30549,">Our first excursion, as a nation, onto foreign soil.

Um, that isn't true. 

Edit: Unless Sandwich, Canada wasn't foreign in July of 1812. And also as long as we are not counting Marines landing and fighting on North African or Sumatran soil. Both these things happened prior to Veracruz."
30550,"I suppose you could count the Libya thing but it was only 8 marines leading 500 Greeks troops. I had never heard of the Sumatra battle! Very interesting. I suppose for the sake of argument, we entered Mexico with the intent to defeat Mexico. In the land theatre in Libya we were basically leading foreign troops and in Sumatra it was a punitive strike for villagers killing the crew of one of our ships. Maybe it's better to clarify by what our intentions were when our troops landed on foreign soil. Thanks for the tip on the Sumatra thing. Something to learn about!"
30551,See thats what I mean.  Correct me if I am wrong.  I dont remember hearing about US soldiers moving into mexican territory
30552,"The issue of Americans in questionable territory was definitely an impetus for Mexicans attacking the soldiers lead by Zachary Taylor.  Polk, being quite the Machiavelli, positioned Taylor beyond the [Nueces River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War#Conflict_over_the_Nueces_Strip) intending to start an international conflict.  Polk also attempted to start an armed rebellion in California, enter John Fremont.  Also, Polk considered the Mexican refusal to treat with [John Slidell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Slidell#Merchant.2C_lawyer.2C_politician) (second paragraph) as provocation for military engagement.  

Abraham Lincoln was gained early fame in congress as ""Spotty Lincoln"" for introducing the [Spot Resolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions), which protested President Polk to prove that the spot American troops were attacked on was indeed on American soil, which would garner war.  

The Mexican-American war was possibly the most engineered war in American history, possibly aside from the Iraq War in 2003."
30553,"I'm British, not American, and neither have I been formally educated in history, but here's me 2 cents for the ones I actually know a little about:

US Revolution - AFAIK the American colonists did indeed pay the lowest taxes of all colonies. Their issue was not the tax itself, but the fact that they were paying tax without a member of parliament to represent them (the representation part of ""no taxation without representation"" is very important!). I'm not sure the exact level of support for the revolution at the time, but I do know that huge numbers of people loyal to the crown moved North after it occurred (it's one of the reasons why Quebec never really had enough support for its own revolution, iirc). I guess that given the depth of feeling, some sort of revolution was bound to occur at some stage.

War of 1812 - Dunno much about it, but I guess a second war was inevitable to ""settle accounts"" after the first.

Civil war - About as valid or invalid as the revolutionary war, surely?

Spanish-American war - Unjustified. An attempt by the US to ""prove itself"" on the world stage as one of the Great Powers.

World wars - both justified, but the US turned up late to both of them. :P

Korea/Vietnam - Justified in a historical context. It wasn't just the US randomly messing in small countries' affairs, it was about stemming the tide of communism. There was a real fear that, if left unchecked, it could spread much further.

Gulf War I - Justified in keeping the expansionism of a regional power in check.

Afghanistan - Justified. Remember that the government in Afghanistan was the Taliban, and as such the country was a safe base of operations for groups definitely hostile to the US/west.

I'd also argue that the recent intervention in Libya was justified, and any possible (but probably unlikely) intervention in Syria would also be justified."
30554,"With regard to Vietnam specifically, it was (in my opinion) unjustified because the Vietnamese communists were arguably more pro-American than pro-Chinese or pro-Russian. It was political bigotry that caused our allegiance to fall where it did and caused our actions to be so out of step with our interests, and it wasn't justified. If we could have said, ""Vietnam's government is communist, but they're *our* communists!"" a lot of idiocy could have been averted there and elsewhere.

With Korea, well, what are you gonna do? That was almost just an epilogue to WWII."
30555,Exactly Ho could be like Tito!
30556,"Re the Revolution: Once I got to University level classes they made it pretty clear that the colonies were looking for any excuse to rebel and that Parliment handed them everything they could ask for over the remarkably sage-like objections of Pitt the Elder. Honestly when you remove patriotism from your perspective both sides appear to have acted like children.
 
The Anglo-American War of 1812 is generally over shadowed in Britain by the Napoleonic War or 1812 and for good reason, it was a fairly undecisive war fought over a point which had been resolved months before war was declared and ended more or less in a continuation of the Status Quo. It gets emphasized in American education as a ""coming of age for the Nation"" as the simple fact that the US didn't get it's ass kicked was a vicotry in and of itself.
 
The American Civil War: This one is tricky. If you take the Union position all of the Confederate casus belli look like thinly vieled justifications for the maintainence of slavery while the other side claims they were defending States Rights or their way of life... like all civil wars it's messy and divisive.
 
Spanish-American War: You pretty much hit the nail on the head. Unjustified but pretty typical of the era.
 
World War I: If taken as a whole I would argue that the war as a whole was unjustified and unnecissary no matter which side you were on. It was a damned shame and could have been avoided. As for the American entry into the war well... it's messy. The sinking of the Lusitania was an atrocity but the ship WAS transporting weapons.
 
World War II: When given the benefit of knowing what Japan was doing in China and what the Nazis were doing to the Jews the war looks pretty damn justified; at the time though it was a little murky. The various and sundry embargos placed on Japan made the Pacific War pretty much unavoidable while I'm of the opinion that Nazi Germany would have torn itself apart eventually (The French resistance would have kicked the Germans out on their own if given enough time; after all French military failures have always been failures of command, not valor) I think the war was the lesser evil of the available options.
 
Korea: I just don't know enough to say one way or the other but from what I do know it appears pretty justified.
 
Vietnam: IMHO this was the least justified war in American history. Ho Chi Mihn's ideals were very Occidental in their bent and had anyone bothered to *listen* to him it would have been made clear Vietnam was *not* the domino America feared it was; hell look no further than what they did to the Khmer Rouge.
 
First Gulf War, Afganistan, Libya and the potential intervention in Syria: I whole heartedly agree."
30557,">World wars - both justified, but the US turned up late to both of them. :P

Cute, but we thought you would be able to take care of it on your own!!"
30559,"How can you possibly justify Libya and Syria, but not Iraq 2?"
30560,I didn't mention Iraq II. The above isn't an exhaustive list.
30561,"Yea ok that *might* justify Viet Nam, but what about Cambodia?  The American invasion of South-East Asia was a war crime."
30562,"U.S. Revolution:

* What pissed off Britain?

War of 1812:

I don't know enough of the circumstances of the Revolutionary War, but ""No Taxation without Representation"" certainly doesn't capture it in full. International trade is a major factor in most of the wars the US has been involved in.

You can't avoid the Mexican War and the Civil War, nor can you avoid WW-I&II. You also can't avoid the war in Afghanistan since the state was protecting Osama and allowing his organization a place to prepare for war/terrorism. I could imagine a war with Pakistan in the future if their government stays incompetent.

We could have avoided both Iraq wars."
30564,"Yea, I didn't really put much into that one, as you can see I didn't put any answer on Spain's end. I just remember the Maine incident was used as the political justification in the United States at the time. That's why I used a question mark :P."
30565,thanks for the detailed info.  But was it legal for president Monroe to declare/enforce the Monroe Doctrine?
30567,I meant legal by US law
30568,">WWII:
>**What pissed off the Axis? US Trade Policy**
>What pissed off the US? Japan bombing Pearl Harbor

I don't think so. The Japanese pre-emptively attacked the US because they believed a conflict between the two powers over the Pacific was inevitable, and they wanted to strike pre-emptively in order to have free-reign to expand for a bit. Although the US oil embargo hurt Japan, it wasn't the catalyst for war."
30569,"The embargo was still was a major catalyst. It forced Japan to look elsewhere for oil, and by that I mean invade more countries. Japan feared the US would defend the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya, so they chose to eliminate the US Pacific fleet before invading those islands."
30570,"Japan needed more resources than simply oil. The home islands don't really have any substantial deposits of raw materials- if Japan were to stay a Great Power, she would have to obtain the resources of the surrounding area."
30571,"This is the exact explanation I got. I was under the impression that Japan wanted to do some empire building in their neck of the woods, but were afraid that if they were to get bogged down in fighting in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya the Americans would come across the Pacific and either attack Japan itself or make supplying the forward deployed forces impossible. They planned to destroy our Pacific presence in one fell swoop, make their land grabs in Asia, and be back to defend their flank before we could re-mobilize."
30572,"No, I was thinking more of the US selling weapons to the Allies and not selling them quite so much to the Axis."
30573,"Okay, but it was still Japan who dragged the US into the war."
30574,"Yea, the US really did try to stay neutral, but still had to stay in business selling things."
30575,But the US was very selective in who it traded with.
30576,I don't understand what you mean here.
30577,"I mean the US didn't want to go to war, we wanted to go to the bank. Fighting between folks importing from the US made it politically complicated enough for the powers fighting that they dragged us into WWII."
30578,"America saw itself as the Arsenal of Democracy. It supplied the Allies but the U.S. government didn't make any money. Allies received up to 90% off tanks, bullets, food, planes, basically free destroyers. FDR tried to help the Allies while not getting Americans killed. Pretty noble if you ask me."
30579,"That's an interesting take, will have to read into it. From what I've read I've made assumptions and you're doing a good job challenging them :)."
30580,"Just to chime in here, the interest of the US reached beyond greed.  I highly suggest you check out A Bodyguard of Lies by Anthony Brown; Brown suggests that FDR actually ""warmongered"" the US into a position suitable for intervention in Europe.  These warmongering actions include rousing anti-German sentiments, quietly of course, pushing US trading vessels into german uboat zones, provoking Japan (offering outlandish peace settlements, oil embargo), and not acting on the tip that Japan was planning to attack Pearl Harbor.  This claim is supported by founded evidence we have on FDR's strong anti-isolationist sentiments, strong pro-British sentiments, and his anti-nazi stance."
30581,"I have to say, living in a place that has its fair share of conspiracy theorists, I wouldn't actually take his word on it. From what you've said, I can interpret the economic partnership with Britain as a pretext to all of the scenarios you described."
30582,I think you are full of shit.
30583,Not sure if I understand a list wherein US involvement in WWI is justified and Afghanistan is a question mark...
30584,"why dont you think the germans enticing the mexicans to declare war on the US combined with german u-boat attacks on ships with americans is not justification.  Not attacking your opinion, just curious.

also for afghanistan I lean more toward it was justified.  It just seemed like it happened so quickly like the government just reacted instantly to Afghanistans refusal to turn over osama without trying something else first."
30585,"I wasn't making an judgment one way or another on either -- just lining up your two opinions side-by-side.

WWI was ""justified"" in a certain sense, but generally a mistake in my opinion.

With Afghanistan: we had no real proof that OBL planned the September 11th, 2001 attacks (and I believe we still don't have any that he was active in the details or the go-ahead) but if he wanted to place himself at the head of Al-Qaeda he gets to be responsible for its actions. And the September 11th, 2001 attacks were not the first attack by OBL's Al-Qaeda on Americans. And certainly the content of OBL's statements in the 1997-2001 period rise to the level of the Zimmerman Telegram in terms of explicit threat to the United States

So, apart from the ""right"" or ""wrong"", it just seems to me that the standards being used to judge WWI and Afghanistan aren't the same."
30586,"If those were the reasons the US went to war, you might have a case.

It's pretty widely accepted that the US entered WWI to secure it's economic position, rather than being somehow 'provoked' by the Germans or out of altruistic notions.

The US entered because they feared exclusion from post war European markets."
30587,Why did they wait so long to join then?
30588,"Because they weren't aware of it until mid-war.
Word trickled out that the European nations planned on restricting US trade, creating a trade union that would be similar to today's EU, only (more) exclusionary and protectionist."
30589,"You forgot the French and Indian war. Or the entire war against the Indians. I think we all agree that was pretty unjust, but we wouldn't all be here without it."
30590,I didnt include French and Indian because it was pre US.  Indians I actually didnt think about. But I think most people would say unjustified.
30591,"You are right about the French and Indian war, I didn't think of that either. But, there were other battles against Indians after 1776. Like the Battle of the Little Bighorn 1876, but we know how that one turned out...."
30592,"I thought of it, but it's a pre-US war. What happened between the US and Native Americans is a very ugly series of conflicts--particularly since there was a lot of cultural ignorance involved."
30593,I think all wars are valid and all wars are invalid...
30594,The horror. The horror.

30597,"Can you clarify the overall process of judging which war is justified/valid and which isn't?  I.e. what standards does a war have to meet to be justified?

I suspect that the methodology of determining justifiability of a war is quite subjective.  Korean War may be intervening in another country's internal affairs, but I doubt most South Koreans are upset at US for getting involved."
30598,I said in the post that I was trying to go by US law but I am also using my personal opinion of morality which obviously means jack to anyone else.

30600,"Must that prevent us from engaging in an interesting discussion? There's no doubt that the wars listed above are wars, declared or not."
30601,"Oh, no i completely agree with this discussion. I meant nothing by that comment. I only said it as a random piece of information. I didn't mean it to come off as rude."
30602,"Oh, I didn't think it was rude, no worries. :)"

I'd say that an argument for their necessity would be hard to make, but let's not forget them."
30604,Korea was a UN sanctioned war if that means anything
30605,"I guess I'll write about the wars I disagree with you on. 

Mexican American war was unjustified, a war of conquest that helped exacerbate the slavery problem, leading to the civil war. 

Civil war - justified because the south had no grievances worth secession. There has to be a bar set for any type of declaration of independence. 

Korean war - justified because it wasn't merely a small war between two small nations but an overt attack by the soviet union to extend its influence. As the only other superpower capable of standing against the USSR and maintaining a balance of power, we had a responsibility to draw a line in the sand at some point. 

Vietnam war - unjustified because we had a chance to recognize ho and Vietnamese independence but instead we sided with the French. By the time of the Johnson administration it gets murky. On one hand you want to contain the spread of soviet influence, but on the other hand we were backing a horrid south Vietnamese government. 

Gulf war - unjustified because Iraq asked us our opinion before the invasion and instead of putting our foot down we gave saddam an answer vague enough for him to feel comfortable to invade."
30606,">Gulf war - unjustified because Iraq asked us our opinion before the invasion and instead of putting our foot down we gave saddam an answer vague enough for him to feel comfortable to invade.

This is a much-repeated thing, but it's misleading. It's based almost entirely on this transcription of a meeting between an American diplomat (Glaspie) and President Saddam Hussein. Here is the relevant passage:

>GLASPIE: I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. **But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.**
>    
>    I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60's. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. **We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak.** All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us?

It is clear that an invasion is not on the table here, and that the United States does not want to get involved in negotiations over an OPEC dispute directly, and want it dealt with peacefully and diplomatically via another Arab party.

From a [1990 Wikileaks message](http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/1990/07/90BAGHDAD4237.html#) detailing the same meeting:

    ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT, SADDAM'S MESSAGE
    TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH
    TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK'S DIPLOMACY, BUT WE MUST
    TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE ""SELFISHNESS"" IS
    UNBEARABLE. AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN
    NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN
    PEACEFUL MEANS. END SUMMARY.

Note the second-to-last sentence. Furthermore, throughout the summary of the meeting it is clear that Saddam Hussein is well aware that his aggression could spark a US Government response. Iraq was trying to judge our willingness to intervene, we gave a pat answer about not wanting to get involve in inter-Arab border conflicts -- Iraq judged that answer incorrectly, and thought it meant a full-scale invasion and resource takeover was okay (when really what it meant was we didn't want to get involved in OPEC's conflict resolution process). ""Oops""."
30607,"What exactly qualifies as a ""grievance worth secession"" by your standards?"
30608,"> Civil war - justified because the south had no grievances worth secession. There has to be a bar set for any type of declaration of independence.

This could potentially be an interesting discussion. Where exactly would you set that bar?"
30609,I agreed with you on vietnam and Gulf war.  Korean war I always thought of as similar to Vietnam in the sense that the US was trying to stop the spread of the Soviets/communism.  Which I lean to an isolationist viewpoint that we shouldn't use our people to fight in foreign wars when there has been no attack on the US.
30610,"US Revolution - Justified. The body politic no longer wished to be ruled by the British government.
 
War of 1812 - Justified. The body politic wanted to defend itself from Britain. 

Mexican American war - Justified. The body politic identified with the Texan settlers and wanted to defend them.

Civil War - Justified. The Confederacy attempted to subvert the legal institutions of the American democracy.

Spanish american war - Justified. The American body politic was overwhelmingly in favor of waging war on Spain for their actions in Cuba.

World War I - Justified. The body politic felt that American neutrality had been violated and that freedom of the seas was necessary to be restored.

World War II - Justified. The body politic was overwhelmingly in favor of the conflict. 

Korean War - Justified. The body politic was opposed to the spread of communism, and the United Nations mandated action, which the United States as a member, had to participate in.

Vietnam - Justified. The body politic voted time and time again for candidates who favored expanding the war in Vietnam, implying support for the conflict. 

Gulf War I - Justified. The United Nations mandated action, the American body politic supported action, and international law had to be upheld.

Afghanistan - Justified. The American population demanded a war of vengeance. 

Iraq II - Justified. The American body politic approved of the conflict with Iraq."
30611,"By this standard, the enemy in every war was also justified."
30612,"Yep. Any war which is done according to the legal institutions of a nation is, to me, justified, as long as it is in accordance with the predominant views of the body politic.  

EDIT: Also, down votes for my opinion? Really? You don't have to upvote it, but if you disagree, at least tell me why so we may discuss it."
30613,"Because by your standards anything can be justified. War World II? Yup, nationalist socialist party of Germany wanted it, so according to them the war is justified. Holocaust? Again, that was done according to the nationalist socialist party. There is really nothing to discuss with you, your opinion is that if some entity wants to wage a war then they have full right to wage and damn the consequences."
30614,"And? The alternative is belief in an absolute code of morality that is unchanging across time and place, which is easily disprovable. Moral systems change, and with them, acceptable behavior. The alternative is the belief that vast swaths of human beings have lived immoral lives for most of their existence.

Take an absolutist view on homosexual rights, for example. Already, we are limiting the pool of moral people to anyone born in a Western country in the last twenty years, to say nothing else of these people. 

Hell, we don't even have a consensus on moral codes today - some view abortion as infanticide and others as a woman's right to her own body. In the absence of moral certainty, one must default to legal institutions as the only criteria by which justice can be defined, or accept that no objective standard on a just war will ever exist and that the question is inherently meaningless."
30615,"You're using legal/political justifications, whereas some people, like me, are thinking more in terms of moral justification. Afghanistan was more morally justified than Iraq II, and Iraq II was very poorly handled in terms of securing long term political support. Both Afghanistan and Iraq II had crappy strategies because Bush might have gone skiing one too many times with his coke friends."
30616,"Why is legality the same as morality for you?

All genocides are moral and justified as long as they are not explicitly illegal (and perhaps, additionally, the body politic agrees with them)?

You have your causality backwards: laws are made to conform to morality, something is not moral just because it is legal."
30617,"Because laws are an absolute standard for a defined community of people in ways morals can never be. If you ask a hundred people to define right and wrong, you'll receive a hundred definitions. Ask them whether an act is illegal or legal, however, and you receive one."
30618,"I take great umbrage at your opinion that the Korean war was unjustified.

The Communists attack SK without provocation, and Communist control of SK endangered US interests in Japan.

Even without the necessity of protecting US interests, the goal of protecting a population from a communist government is a noble motivation.

Additionally, the US was not the aggressor."

No they didn't.  WW1 was completely unjustified.  The us complained about uboats, but ignored the much more extensive British blockade of Germany.  Mexico was in the middle of a civil war at the time and completely incapable of attacking the US.  In fact, there was a US force in mexico at the time hunting down Pancho Villa.

As for Korea and Vietnam, defending sovereign nations from invaders attempting to impose a murderous ideology by force of arms is just about the definition of justifiable war."
30621,">No they didn't. WW1 was completely unjustified. The us complained about uboats, but ignored the much more extensive British blockade of Germany.

The difference was that the British weren't sinking American ships and killing their crews/passengers. The Germans were. Also, the US didn't ignore the British blockade--the US protested when the British seized American ships heading for Germany, and the UK relented. The Germans intentionally resumed unrestricted submarine warfare knowing that this would cause war with the USA.

>Mexico was in the middle of a civil war at the time and completely incapable of attacking the US. In fact, there was a US force in mexico at the time hunting down Pancho Villa.

Irrelevant. The point is that Germany *tried* to start another US/Mexican War. That alone is a casus belli."

No they didn't. They maintained the blockade until the end of the war.  And their blockade was just as illegal

not really.  the deal was that IF the US declared war then Germany would make an alliance with Mexico."
30623,">No they didn't. They maintained the blockade until the end of the war. And their blockade was just as illegal

It was a violation of the US's neutral rights, but the British weren't the ones killing American citizens and destroying their property. That was Germany.

>not really. the deal was that IF the US declared war then Germany would make an alliance with Mexico.

In other words they tried to entice a war between the US/Mexico, as the Germans were aware that they were annoying the US quite a bit with their use of submarines."
30624,">It was a violation of the US's neutral rights, but the British weren't the ones killing American citizens and destroying their property

The British absolutely were seizing american property and preventing trade.  

>In other words they tried to entice a war between the US/Mexico, as the Germans were aware that they were annoying the US quite a bit with their use of submarines.

no.  They were making plans assuming that the anglophile Woodrow Wilson would eventually find a way into the war on his own, which he did."
30625,">The British absolutely were seizing american property and preventing trade.

Which is considerably less heinous than torpedoing American ships without warning and drowning their crews like Germany was.

>no. They were making plans assuming that the anglophile Woodrow Wilson would eventually find a way into the war on his own, which he did.

'Making plans' because they knew that there was a good chance the US would enter the war after they resumed killing Americans at sea. Wilson would probably have been impeached if he hadn't asked for a declaration of war--which passed in congress with overwhelming majorities."
30626,"The Spanish American War was pretty ridiculous. TR got his fame there being a ""Rough Rider"" and fucking up everything in Cuba.

Why would that be acceptable to the United States?

30632,"Seems to me that would be more acceptable than a meaningless war that has lasted longer than a decade.

30650,">I can't find any information whatsoever regarding your first claim.

As you can imagine, it's very hard to find the search string involving mention of a ""tour of pearl harbor"" that doesn't refer to people touring the tourist attraction. I don't have an article handy but this is a rarely discussed historical event, seen variously as embarrassing or telling. 

>I'm not sure why you think they were ""dregs""? What gives you the impression that numerous battleships (including Admiral Kimmel's flagship), cruises, and destroyers are the dregs?

I may be mistaken, but I was of the impression that these were mostly old wooden deck ships, and the modern ships were out to sea at the time. 

>That doesn't make them any more useful than the ships at Pearl Harbor. Eight of the nine battleships that made up the strength of the Pacific Fleet were sunk.

Old, outdated, outmoded ships. Sacrificial cows to cajole the public into accepting war."
30651,">I may be mistaken, but I was of the impression that these were mostly old wooden deck ships, and the modern ships were out to sea at the time.

They had wooden decks, but that didnt mean the decks werent armored. All the Battleships at Pearl Harbor had between 3.5 and 5 inches of deck armor. Though it should be noted that the American battleships used and ""[all or nothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_nothing_\(armor\))"" scheme so a place that wasnt vital to either the ability of the ship to shoot back or float would not be armored. So the bow or stern probably werent heavily armored, if at all. 

Anyway, while the Battleships werent exactly new, the US hadnt produced a battleship since 1921, so as far as the battleships go, they were the best that the US had to offer. It wasnt until the [North Carolina Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_class_battleship#North_Carolina), the 1st of which was laid down in 1937, that the US had a modern battleship. 

Really the most modern capital ships the Navy had at that point were the [Yorktown Class Carriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown_class_aircraft_carrier). Some of the Enterprise's aircraft actually participated in the fight at pearl harbor. On the other hand, the Yorktown was not even deployed in the Pacific at the time, the Lexington was ferrying aircraft to Midway, and the Saratoga was in San Francisco harbor just off spending some time in dry dock."
30652,Weren't the British actually the ones that sent the message to the Mexicans and framed the Germans for it to get the Americans to join in? I believe it was called the Zimmerman Telegram.
30653,"It was called the Zimmerman Telegram, but in the rest of your comment you're citing a conspiracy that basically no historian on the planet actually believes. And since this is r/history, that matters. There may have been somewhat biased translation, from what I remember, but it wasn't ""actually"" the British that ""framed"" the Germans."
30654,"Thank you for letting me know. It is /r/history and facts do matter, thats why I phrased my post as a question."
30655,"Just regarding your question as to whether the war was Mexican Aggression...the answer is either an unambiguous no or a confused, qualified, and highly technical yes, depending on what perspective you approach it with.

The proximate cause of the war was the annexation of the Republic of Texas by the United States in 1845. The Republic of Texas was a breakaway country of mostly Anglo settlers who had migrated (especially from southern states like Tennessee) into Texas and settled there, yet grew disenchanted with the Mexican government's centralizing dictatorial policies (in particular, Mexico's opposition to slavery and promotion of Catholicism, but more generally, the ending of regional autonomy), and rebelled and formed their own country. It's critical to point out that Texas was not the only breakaway country from Mexico in this time period...many regions attempted to set up their own country, most notably the Republic of the Rio Grande (northeastern Mexico/southern Texas today) and the Republic of the Yucatan (the Yucatan peninsula). Texas was the only one of those states that broke away over the true long-term, although the Yucatan Republic lasted 1841-1848 and there was some reasonable expectation that Mexico would continue to fragment.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Wpdms_republic_of_texas.svg/333px-Wpdms_republic_of_texas.svg.png

Texas and Mexico, as you can see in this map, had very different views over what the appropriate boundaries of Texas were, and, in fact, Texas' second President, Mirabeau Lamar, sent a humiliatingly failed military expedition to press Texas' claims on Santa Fe in 1841. The Republic of Texas, a borderline failed state with no sound economic footing, applied for US annexation in the mid-1840s and proved a major campaign issue in the 1844 election, with both candidates aware that annexation of Texas could provoke war with Mexico. Polk enthusiastically backed annexation of Texas, Clay hesitantly and with reservation endorsed the annexation of Texas. Polk won and John Tyler organized the annexation of Texas in his lame duck period.

Part of the problem that emerged: what exactly had the United States annexed? Did it annex the territory that the Texans had claimed or did they annex just the parts of Texas that Mexico recognized as Texas? Did Texas end at the Nueces or the Rio Grande river? Polk sought to force the issue, and sent Zachary Taylor to set up camp in the disputed territory, south of the Nueces but north of the Rio Grande. The provocation accomplished what it intended to, and when the Mexican army defended the land they claimed, Polk had his excuse to wage a full war with Mexico.

Was it unwise for the Mexican army to begin hostilities with Taylor's force? Possibly, but what other option does a country have when their neighbor sends an expeditionary force to occupy disputed border territory? Does the Mexican action sound like an act of aggression?

Polk characterized it thusly:

""The cup of forbearance had been exhausted even before the recent information from the frontier of the Del Norte. But now, after reiterated menaces, Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil. She has proclaimed that hostilities have commenced, and that the two nations are now at war.""

Was that American blood shed on American soil, or on Mexican soil?"
30656,"Regardless of who provoked who before the war started, and who was in the wrong. I still view the annexation of what was 1/3 of the Mexican States during that time an objectively unethical and unjust move on the side of the United states. I would understand if they only annexed Texas, but they went the full 100 miles and annexed the entire west coast from Mexico. I know that the west coast wasn't a threat to the U.S. because only around 75,000 Mexicans lived in Mexico's northern territories, so the only other reason I can think of why the U.S. would annex the territory is because of Manifest Destiny and imperialism. I mean the U.S. did the same thing in the Spanish American war, they annexed the philippines, Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico from the Spanish Empire. 

Guess in short my question is: Do you think that after the U.S. won the war they were justified in annexing the entire west coast from Mexico?"
30657,Justified by 19th century standards?
30659,"Keep in mind that much of the territory annexed between the Rio Grande and the West coast was Mexican in name only. The northern border was hugely destabilized by Mexican independence in 1821 and what little governmental control existed before then almost entirely ceased to exist. Expansion of the Mexican state also took some time to happen after independence. In some areas the Spanish had been gone for less than a decade by the time the territory transitioned to American control. I try to avoid making unnecessary moral judgements about anyone involved, but the situation is really quite complicated to describe in our 'normal' terms."
30660,"This question pops up from time to time.  I'll repost my last answer. It's not by any means exhaustive. Maybe someone else has some recommendations.

A very good one is John Mason Hart's *Revolutionary Mexico*: it's pretty commonly used.   Friedrich Katz's *The Life and Times of Pancho Villa* is a truly excellent - and careful- biography that sorts out a lot of legend from reality- but it's not a thin book, you'll need some time to go through it. Brenner's venerable *The Wind that Swept Mexico* has a simplistic and dated text, but includes a lot of great photos ( some classic ones) and used copies of it are common.
