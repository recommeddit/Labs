2484,"Huh, who knew. I honestly dont care. Upvotes and downvotes mean nothing, I am just here for conversation. 

Earbuds are headphones in my eyes. They go in my ear and I can listen to music. I cant stand on-head headphones. They are to bulky and I cant store them anywhere. they would be just one more thing for me to carry. 

But a few things to note here. 1. Skullcandy are by far the best that I have ever owned. You can map out my entire life by what pair of headphones I had at any given time. Ill admit, headphone technology has come along way since the early 90's and the quality has gotten better and better, But I have never had a pair of headphones last through what I can put Skullcandies through, nor have I had a pair that can match their quality of sound, especially for earbuds. I have owned them all, Sony, Bose, JVC, Philips, AKG, Razor for my gaming, the list goes on. (and can we please not talk about Beats by DRE, my god) They were like shoes to me. Give them six months to a year, and they would short out, break, or just simply fall apart at the seams. I have had the same pair of SC for over two years now. I dont really need to go on about this
2. I am poor. 20-30 bucks is a luxury to me. So that two years of not buying another pair of headphones has saved me a lot of money. I could never justify buying headphones that costed as much as you mentioned. That is another reason why I stick to them. Even at their cheapest pair,($15) the quality of sound and materials is phenomenal compared to other brands you can get at that price. 

Now, I am an open person. Im willing to try out something new. Give me some brands you would recommend and I will check them out. If you can give me something better than SC, I will erase everything I have said."
2485,"Head over to /r/headphones and check out the 'start here' tab, and search through the previous posts. Check out the buying guide and read up on the different sort of headphone constructions and what their pros/cons are. That sub is SUPER helpful and helped me choose my headphones.

Headphones are quite a personal thing, and you'll need to take into account where you plan on using them the most, what you listen to (as you said mostly rock, jazz etc) and things like that."
2486,"Thanks for the heads up. I'll be sure to visit it when I want to upgrade or need to replace. I just ordered these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HVLUR18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Heard nothing but good reviews and I know the bran is up there with the best."
2487,"Low cost?
Monoprice has surprised me with their quality / cost ratio.  Consider these:

2488,"Absolutely this, the Monoprice 8323's are excellent headphones. You'll have a hard time finding anything under $150 that comes close, and these are only $25.

Also, http://www.cnet.com/news/how-good-can-21-59-headphones-be/"
2489,"Based on my experience with other Monoprice products, this guy is definitely on to something."
2490,THIS.
2491,"Have a look at Superlux - They make REALLY good headphones, that cost next to nothing.

EDIT: [Thomann.de](http://www.thomann.de/gb/superlux_headphones.html) has them. I assume you're in the UK?"
2492,"Yes. In the UK. And wow, they look really good!"
2493,"They're incredibly cheap, and they sound bloody amazing. I have two different ones, the HD 669 (closed) which sound almost just as good as my old AKG K240's, and I have HD 681F (semi-open) that also sound really good (not as good as the HD 669).

Every person I've lured into buying them were floored by the price/performace factor.

At around/under â‚¬30 they are unbeatable."
2494,"They are great, just got a pair of 668B from Amazon. Great quality neutral sound for the price"
2495,I've had mine for a few months now. I'm a fan.
2496,Audio Technica M50s
2497,"Those are about $50 over OP's budget.  Good headphones though, just bought a pair recently and I like them a lot."
2498,If you're patient and look around you can generally spot a sale to get them at OP's price
2499,I started with audio technica several years ago.  I've upgraded to the ath-anc7b now.  They make excellent headphones for the price.
2500,[The Headphone List](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone-review-list/) agrees with you assuming a ~$100 budget. For under $70 looks like a Koss Pro DJ100 or Superlux HD668B.
2501,"If you can, spend the extra bit for the M50x. Having a detachable cord is soooo nice :) I have one for my desktop and use the other two that it comes with for my iphone."
2502,"I have ATH-M50s and they are fantastic, but I recommend buying [these](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC840-Replacement-Cushions-Headphones/dp/B002Z9JWZS) pads along with them. The stock pads are extremely uncomfortable, but with the Shure's I can easily listen to an entire album without adjusting them at all."
2503,"> extremely uncomfortable

that's a little much. I own these things and I forget when I have them on sometimes."
2504,"I'm sure it's different from person to person, but I've heard a lot of others complain about their comfort as well. The main issue was that they only covered about 95% of my ears, so a small part of my ear was getting pinched. With the slightly bigger pads that's not an issue."
2505,fair enough. I just didn't want people getting dissuaded from what I see as an excellent pair of headphones.
2506,Sony mdr7506 or mdr v6 are what I use. The 7506 are much punchier with the bass and fit somewhat tightly. The v6 is like wearing a pillow and has a nice warm sound. Neither costs more than eighty bucks I think. I'm not sure since these pairs must be around 15 years old or something.
2507,"+1 for v6! keep in mind that the v6 are meant to be accurate, not boomy, so the low end might not be what you're expecting. you'll hear parts of favorite songs you didn't even know were there."
2508,"I was going to say.. There's a bunch of Sonys from $50-80 just as good/better than ""beats"" or something."
2509,"if he's going way low budget I love my MDR-V300's. It's an older model, but they fit well on me and the sound quality is good enough for my needs."
2510,"> I'm not sure since these pairs must be around 15 years old or something.

This is why these are the correct answer."
2511,MDR-V6 gets my vote.
2512,Grado SR-60 is just barely over your budget and are fantastic.
2513,"I had the Panasonic RP-HTX7-G1 for a while and they were good, at least for me, not sure about you. They are extremely durable and quite cheap I think."
2514,Agreed. They're bombproof and have quite decent sound.
2515,"Love these, I have a pink pair."
2516,"I have similar, if not identical cans. I've had them for years and they show few signs of giving up anytime soon. I've abused them somewhat, but the sound quality is still great. I'll definitely check out Panasonics the next time I need cans."

Extremely good quality, really affordable

I really recommend these!"
2524,"Not over ear but I join the praise. This set is amazing for its price as long as you don't mind pinching some hair with the band on occasion.

It is a very good set. There is a version with an in line mic but I don't have that. It is essentially unchanged for decades.

I can also join previous recommendations on the sennheisers and Sony sets as well as the ath-m50 which is a bit over budget but you cab sometimes find good deals. Also on Amazon.

I splurged on v-moda m100 recently but 70 USD will get you a good pair.

At this price I also recommend looking at AKG cans as well as the German Teufel, but the latter isn't to my own taste. Others recommend it."
2525,"This question pops up frequently and I hope people look into these

The KOSS PORTA PRO is my absolute pick. I also listen to a LOT of what I call ""sweet spot"" music and these always come through (the subtle parts of production are too often lost) not with the Koss. There is no noise cancelling and though they are over ear there is ambient sounds coming through but they never disappoint. 

As I've said in other forums I have bought over 20 pair of these over the years and gifted them to friends with many big smiles. They used to have lifetime guaranty but I'm not sure what current policy is (I have sent damaged ones in with $5.00 and had them returned like new. About $40.00 online(amazon)? or where you can find the. Great for travel cause they fold nicely.  Do your ears a favor, they will surprise you."

2555,"Before I actually started browsing Amazon.com I would have recommended the AKG k514 MKII. They are clear and airy. Decent highs and lows, but they shine in the middle. If you listened to bass heavy genres you would have found them lacking but if you want clear vocals and acoustics these are the phones for you. As an added bonus of the many budget headphones that have passed through me these are by far the most comfortable to wear.They are currently on sale for $67.95  on Amazon.com


Now - just buy AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones, on sale for $68.29(from $159.00). These are considered one of the best semi-professional headphones for under $200 and the fact that you can get them for $70 is just mind-boggling."

2569,"I don't remember what the economic theory is, but it was talking about how the rich stay rich because they don't have to spend as much money.  A good pair of boots costs $50 (this was from a long time ago...) and would last several years.  A cheap pair of boots costs $10, and after a couple of months the cardboard would wear out and your feet would get all wet in the rain.  Workers can't afford good boots, so they have to buy cheap boots.  Since they buy cheap boots, they have to be replaced every few months.  A poor person buys 10 pairs of cheap boots in the time a wealthy person only has to buy the one pair of good boots.  The same works for food - the poor person buying low quality fast food pays less per meal than the rich person buying high quality groceries or going to nice restaurants, but the poor person has much more health problems related to their diet, and probably worse insurance, if any, so they pay way more for health care / lose money from time off being sick.

2573,something something monoprice headphones.
2574,"I would tend to agree, overall. When I recommend that people buy (circumaural) headphones, I tend to advice them to spend in a $200-400 range, which tends to cover both the holy triumvirate and a number of very solid mid-end options (Mad Dogs, Focals, a number of quite competent Audio-Technicas, etc), including room for an amp with most of the headphones that require one. Indeed, I wrote a big ol' wall of text a while back justifying quality headphones based on price/hour of listening specifically to validate the $200-400 range to folks with doubts.

I think that IEMs might range just a bit more, perhaps - maybe $100-200, since that ranges from the really solid price/performance $100ish options (SE215, RHA M750i, VC1000,) to the cheaper end of the high end (DN-1000, Custom Art Music One), but that's just me."
2575,"Aye! Though what bugs me about the Focals is that they are closer to a portable headphone design in size than a full-size headphone design. They have quite heavy cables though, suggesting they really are intended as desktop headphones ostensibly for audio monitoring. I haven't worn them for any long period of time though - are they comfortable for long periods compared to other full sized closed backs? (DT770, 1540, Z7, etc.)"
2576,"They're a bit of a conundrum, aren't they? Sadly, I can't attest to them from personal experience, but [Tyll's review] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/two-strike-zone-focal-spirit-professional-and-spirit-classic) seems to imply that they're mediocre in comfort at best for long-term usage."
2577,"I can attest to them from personal experience, and they do have issues with comfort -- their cup size must be designed for French folks because they don't fit me (and since I'm pretty average, i suspect a bunch of other folks) well.  

But to be fair I must also add that the Spirit Pro has one of the most unique looks of any headphone I have seen, with the spackled paint finish that looks remarkably like [the headphones are wet] (http://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/719797.jpg). IMO pictures dont do it justice, you have to see it in real life to get a sense of how gorgeous it is."
2578,"Hey Lachlan,

I have the Spirit One S I just picked up not too long ago. Although I have not tried any of the headphones you listed above, the Focals are not all that comfortable. It is not a problem for me since I never have headphones on for over an hour at a time so it's forgivable but for people who have them on for hours at a time should look elsewhere. I also have quite thick frames on my glasses and I did notice a slight bass leak due to the smaller cups and tighter clamping force but it's definitely something minor and doesn't detract from the overall listening experience imo. Ymmv."
2579,"To some extent you are right, but value also hugely depends on where you live. 

I'll explain what I mean with an example. For example my neighbors in Canada have really crap headphone pricing, and if you look at the same gear, my my ""sweet spot"" here in the US is typically far sweeter than their ""sweet spot"" up in the frozen arctic tundra they call home :-)"

2583,The deals we get up here are few and far between unfortunately :( Lots of equipment cost almost double here than the US. I got my HD650s for around $500 CAD where down south can be had for under $300.. Guess it comes down to supply and demand.

Ogdensburg, NY is an hour drive away from me and I can get a packaged shipped to a holding place there for around $5. Still have to pay gas and duty but still better than the crazy high prices from Canadian retailers.

Unfortunately right now it's not that advantageous because of the abysmally low Canadian dollar. :("

I also got those Shure 940s for 90$. And had a pair or Focal pro's and Focal Spirit ones,  both which I paid less than 200 for.  
If I had to name a price though I'd say the sweet spot is 200. You can get a Q701,  or AD900 for under 200 anywhere I the world if you buy used, sometimes it can be had new.  In terms of Iems you get can get some great stuff for under 150  including the GR07 and RE400."

thanks for the reply.

That's a shame, I really want to get my hands on some hifiman. Guess I'll have to wait for either Massdrop or go with amazon. :x"
2592,"Are you in nz? If so which part? The 400nzd cap really kills it though, even if you get a used he400 for say 250usd you may get slammed with customs/import tax when you include shipping. If you have a chance to go to china or have friends visiting, yiu can pick them uo cheap there. He400i is like 350usd in china! And one user on here got a used demo unit from CL for 500nzd which i dont think was a good deal as thats how much i paid for mine new. When they did advertise them in stock on their website and in store, before they were closing out hifiman due to discontinuation he500s were going for 1200nzd, he-6 were 1800-1900nzd....."
2593,Aucklander here. Yeah.. the import tax is stupidly high in NZ. I had to pay like $300+ tax for my TH-900. I think picking some up from China would be the cheapest option. If not I'll prob just bite the bullet and get them from Amazon.
2594,Have you heard any hifimans in person?
2595,"I have a friend that works at an audio store who calls me up before any good deals make it to the shelf. These were NOS, made in Austria. The initial part of my comment was to show that Canadians CAN get deals. My 'sweet spot' was adjusted to based on prices I'd seen in stores for new products.  For example, the Q701 regular price is 189 on US Amazon."
2596,"> Paid 99$ for my Q701 

what is that in US$ at todays exchange rate? $20? :-)

But seriously, that is an incredible deal for the Q701, and up there with the best steals I have heard of this year"
2597,"I personally think $100-$250, that's a broad range, but I think that's where you get the best value before serious diminishing returns kick in. 

You have some great IEMs from Shure, RHA, etc., some great open cans with the Fidelios, AKG K7s (a lot of them), Sennheisers up to a used 650, etc., and some similarly great closed cans. 

I couldn't personally justify buying any headphones more expensive, but that's just me. I've auditioned the HD800, and it's a great set of headphones, but I don't think it's 7x better than my K7XXs. Same with anything from Audeze."
2598,"$300-500

That's where HD600 is :P"
2599,"Woah you really like neutral headphones haha that flair, just thought it was interesting"
2600,Think about all the headphones you have....if you sold them all how much would you have to spend on an ultimate pair that could fetch you more enjoyment than all of those combined....
2601,"Trust me I am VERY aware of that. It is very difficult to choose just one once I move to TOTLs, which I'll be doing in the next few months. This is a transistionary period. Sadly this isn't even the whole collection either. Too many odds and ends I'm in the process of eliminating. At the end I need one very good closed back for work and a stunning open back for home. So far it's looking like the HD800 may just be the next upgrade as everyone seems to call the Q701 the poor man's HD800"
2602,"> the Q701 the poor man's HD800

they do? Because it's not :-)"
2603,Really? I've heard that before multiple times. Maybe I need to post in the suggestions thread where to go from here
2604,I've got the K702's and HD 800's. The K702's are definitely not the poor man's HD 800.
2605,I'd be very interested in some comparison thoughts if you could give some. I still haven't gotten the chance to hear an 800 yet but am extremely familiar with the sound of the K701/K702
2606,"I have a hard time saying ER4s are neutral honestly, they're very unique to say the least."
2607,"Really? They measure almost perfectly flat and I thought the whole point behind their sound design was to conform to a very accurate curve. Even Tyll said once when asked about the most uncolored headphones he's ever heard, mentioned them."
2608,"They certainly measure well, but their actual sound is very unique.  

Generally neutral means nothing is emphasized and nothing is recessed, but I've never experienced that with the ER4s, mainly because they sound extremely bright and have some huge bass response variance (some notes hit nicely and some are almost not there) that make them not quite neutral in my opinion.  Yes I've had them unamped and ""properly"" amped as well.  

I think what the ER4s do better than anything is analyze the music.  You really can hear everything, nothing is obscured, but there is also almost nothing musical about the sound.  Maybe thats neutral to some people, but I can't really say I agree."
2609,Jeez I wish Canada had prices like that. The hd600 cost $500 in amazon and that is with $100 off
2610,Right now the HD600 is $245 on Newegg though.
2611,i paid $270 for my q701 so i think around that price range. saw the fidelio x2 going for 299 and sorely tempted
2612,I agree. Q701 is a pretty good choice in terms of open-back with detachable cable. :)
2613,How about an HE-400i for an ortho sweet spot?
2614,I think they're definitely the ortho sweet spot for brand new cans. I'd much rather a NFB-15 + HE400i over a HE560 tbh.
2615,This combination makes too much sense.
2616,"I agree with your point about encouraging people to make a smaller purchase to get their feet wet, actually. Specifically I find that for some high end gear, while it may sound great to the right listener, can be utterly offensive to anyone else. Everyone raves about the Beyer dt1350 but I found it to have textureless 'sausage slapping' bass, bodyless mids, piercing highs and terrible sound separation/soundstage. I find that cheaper, value oriented products are usually tuned to have a much more 'inoffensive' sound that they can be easily enjoyed by almost anyone, no matter their tastes for sound.

I also disagree with the criticism that this cheaper gear gets thrown away when the user inevitably upgrades. I still have my PL50s and my Clip Zip, the first pieces of specialty audio equipment that I purchased, and I still make regular use of them. Other entry level headphones (though maybe not so much IEMs) can become handmedows to friends or family who you would like to introduce to the hobby, or even modding playgrounds to show you exactly what makes a headphone sound the way it sounds, and give you an opportunity to tune them to your own two ears in a way that no manufacturer ever could."
2617,"I think there's a lack of ""failsafe"" options in the closed full-sized market compared to other types. Not everyone will like how bassy the DT770 is, or how the A900x fits, or the treble presentation of the MDR-Z7 for example. 

It gets more dependent on your tonal balance preferences, since IME most closed-backs on the market sound very different to each other. It's not like the HD600 / K7-- / DT880 which don't sound drastically different from one another."
2618,"I would say around $50-80 for IEMs, and $100-200 for headphones. Though certaintly not the best, the vsd5s can be had for $69, and the Sennheiser HD598 is for $150 on amazon (same price as my AKG612pros), so I would say thats a pretty good setup. 

For headphones the massdrop K7XXX is a steal at $200, and though certainty not 'endgame', is pretty far up there. I A/B'ed my AKG612 with an HD800 and while the latter is much more resolving and clear, the difference isnt worth the $1000+ premium (and I was using a Sennheiser HDVD800!)"
2619,"In my opinion, I think ......
1) IEM's that are around $100-$200 range have excellent value ie. VSonic GR07, Klipsch Image S4ii/X10
2) Portable headphones around the $200-$350 range ie. NAD Viso HP50, Sennheiser Momentum Over-Ear, Philips Fidelio line
3) Headphones for home-use in the $300-$400 range ie. Sennheiser HD600/650, Philips Fidelio X2"
2620,"I think 300-400 gets pretty damn good open backs and 200-300 for closed backs. Many cans in their respective categories are at the pinnacle of diminishing returns in those price points. I feel like HD25s for 200usd or there abouts is pretty good for portable on ears too. Also lachlan, you should check out the audio technica a900x if you ever get a chance!"
2621,"One thing to keep in mind though, is how many of the full sized headphones you mentioned would need, or at least benefit form an amplifier. This adds $100-300 to the overall price. Still a good point, but it may be easier to swallow getting full sized headphones in the $100-200 range that don't need an amp.

I do fully agree with you though. I recently bought VSD3S, and some HD558's. Can't imagine ""upgrading"" from these for a few years, and my next investment is going to need an amp, and fairly pricey headphones, probably $500+ total easy."
2622,"agreed for IEMs, $200 for portables because that's where the NAD is, and $200 for full sized because that's where the AKG k7s and hd580/used hd600s are. worst value imo are portables and best value would be a tie between $100 IEMs and low $200 full size headphones."
2623,"It's difficult to determine a ""sweet spot"" for audio gear, since everyone's disposable income are different and vary widely, individually. 

I'm a bargain hunter for quality goods. I picked up most of my headphones and IEMs at big discounted prices, but I don't merely buy any and all gear that goes on sale... it has to be to my preferences and liking. For example, no matter how many times ""deals"" pop up for the over-hyped M50X, I'm not going to buy it.

Some of my favorites include the legendary sale of Ultimate Ears TF10 for $95 four years ago, Monster Miles Davis Tribute for $130, Audio-Technica A900X for $106, Audio-Technica ESW9A for $109, Sennheiser HD700 for $325, etc. Gifted Klipsch X10 for $85 and Sennheiser HD598 for $99. 

I guess my personal ""sweet spot"" for good headphones and IEMs is $80-$150. However, if I find a killer deal for an item I really want, like HD700 for $325, I'm going to go above my ""sweet spot"" and try my best to acquire it. 

Most friends and relatives of mine think I'm crazy for spending so much on audio gear, but they don't realize how much more other audiophiles are willing to spend. Some people don't blink an eye dropping hundreds and thousands on hi-fi and summit-fi gear. I'm personally not crazy or wealthy enough to do that (yet). 

I think the vast majority of the general public wouldn't spend more than $100 on headphones and IEMs. Unless of course, it's for superficial reasons like getting Beats as a necklace to look cool in public. But I think even hipsters realize these days that Beats are ripoffs and word has spread that spending so much for crappy - mediocre sound quality is just stupid.

P.S. Keep up the good work on your videos, Lachlan. I hope you buy the HD700 someday and do a proper review (with a good tube amp) for it. :)"
2624,"As to closed, full size headphones, you have to consider the AKG K550's currently retailing in the $200-$250 range and an excellent example of fairly neutral sounding closed headphones with a pretty decent soundstage.  Their only downside is obtaining a good seal for good bass if you have a small head.  If you have a normal or large head or if you add the Alpha Pads for $60 (because you have a small head) you get very adequate bass.  In addition, the stock AKG K550's are very comfortable for closed phones and even more so with the Alpha Pads."
2625,"Nice post OP. I do have to say the HP50 is not a good choice for portable use. While it is a good choice from a technical and sound perspective the headband is very unique and will have people staring. It kind of makes your head look like Frankenstein. If you are punk rock and don't care then all power to you. 

For me the real point of being impressed is $350. For this much or less you can buy the HD650 or the HE400i. They are both amazing. With headphones below this I have been impressed but it wasn't like ""oh wow, what am I hearing?"" impressed. I have been so impressed with these cans that I am planning on adding the HD800 this summer (gonna find new for $900) and hopefully then the HE1000 in later 2015 or worse case scenario with my tax return in early 2016.   ;)"
2626,"I know nothing but a different spin to what you asked is kinda what people budget for when buying gear.

I feel that in a fair few amount of countries 100 of local currency is considered significant so what you get for that price is the main limit. Sure enthusiasts will be willing to spend more. So whats the best option for the users style and location will vary. You probably get a lot more value for 100USD vs 100AUD and less again for 100NZD but the local market probably has similar expectation on quality. Yes it is unrealistic that for less equivalent money to receive the same quality; that is psychology for you.

My usage case is pretty much a pocketable device that interfaces with a mobile device so a headset is desirable. Budget wise I want something I can kinda stomach losing. so life goes on and so does the search."
2627,"I realize i'm 3 months late to this topic, but it is one that I have a lot of ambivalence toward:

I entered the headphone market, when generally, the reasonably best of the market was never upward of $1,000 dollars; then the HD800, PS1000, among others were kicked off, and now the hi-fi become mid-fi.

I climbed that ladder, and came back down. While I applaud Sennheiser for having a flagship that came out 5 years ago, what I really came to understand is the market starting to take advantage of consumers. It -really- bugs me that we have companies on both ends of the scale releasing new products much more often then before.

On some part, I have a bias. I don't want to buy a new headphone every year, thinking that somehow mine has become obsolete. AKG is a good example here, as they've really started to ramp up a 55x and 7xx headphone yearly. While I favored some of their more recent headphone's, I did not want to purchase a new headphone in five years, knowing the K732 had just come out.

One thing I do appreciate though from them is sticking to the same headphone design's for these basic models, because on the other end of constant releases, you do have Sennheiser, for example, putting out ghost updates on their headphone's. At the end of the day, the biggest factor that bugs me though lies within the fashion conscious of why headphone companies are releasing different styles to designs that already work.

For example, you have the M70x and MSR7 that just came out (at least to me). Yesterday I had just gotten my hands on a pair of m40x's, and to be honest, the design to me was perfect. It was understated, fit, had replaceable pads, collapsible, a detachable cable. While I hate the sound signature of the likes on the M50x, the design of it, as a closed, efficient portable, should be the likes that other developers copy and paste. And in all honesty, it baffles me that the MSR7 differentiates so much from that design. The plastic is strong enough, but why not just put more metal parts in that stock design?

I'm really getting off-topic here, because there are so many smaller nitpicks in the market.

In regards to the cheaper China headphones flooding the market now, some of them are actually outstanding. The likes of Monoprice, Focal Spirit, Sound Magic, and NAD are all headphones I love the sound of. Going back to the likes of the M50x though, the durability and comfort don't even come close. This is why I like my time tested companies, like Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic, and Sennheiser, since - for the most part - they get comfort. However, now that you Sennheiser trying to appeal to the Beats crowd, I feel like they can't design a competent portable headphone. The Urbanite and Momentum look good, but the sound signature and design do not appeal to the head well. It's like guitars, since the design of a guitar is meant (with good reason) to comply to the sound of the guitar, and not to the user holding the guitar. These headphone's do not apply with comfort. In those cases, i'll choose a speaker (even on quiet) every time.

The second part of why I stick to time-tested companies is user replaceable parts. While I don't think Sennheiser can make a competent, all encompassing closed headphone (and at the moment, i'm doubting many dynamic drivers can), there was a time I contemplated just owning Sennheiser because many of their models offer parts I can replace, instead of trusting a service, or throwing them in the trash. Beyerdynamic does this will some of their models, albeit Beyerdynamic has some glaring reliability issues. I applaud V-Moda and Koss for offering good deals for replacing of upgrading headphones.


In conclusion, for a seemingly simple closed, efficient, comfortable, competent, portable headphone, simply accomplishing the basics is unfounded. The checklist should be making the portable headphone, efficient, comfortable, and durable/replaceable, giving brownie points for a collapsible design; then one should look for applying an appealing sound signature.

Looking back at designs that have tried to capture this market: the M100 and HD 25 both are not comfortable, not with anything i've tried doing with them. The DT770 accomplishes this, no user detachable cable, and a thin sound signature. The 1540 accomplishes this with a slightly wonky and nonportable design. The options are few. The M40x/M50x accomplish this, and to me are the gold standard, despite that I hate the sound signature; they're the holy relic of good design though.

What do I take and recommend off of this? Moddable headphone's. This mostly applies to the closed and/or portable market, because I will recommend the HD600/HD650 to anyone. Personally, I am under the impression fully sealed, dynamic headphones do not work well in that setting, particularly for a neutral, interesting signature, like the HD600. I'm not going to recommend a headphone to anyone that does not have those basics mentioned above though; however, the Monoprice, the T50RP, HD25 (still uncomfortable), the M50X, have a vast arrange of options for modifying their comfort, sound signature, and durability, like their headbands. For example, it always confuses me that AT will put their protein leather headbands their, like on the ESW9 when they start to flake. What Beyer does with a velcro sealed headband, like on some T50RP mods is simple and smart.

The more time I spend with headphones, the more comfort and durability are important to me. The more i'm using uncomfortable headphones, the more compromising I am going to be on a sound signature. It should come warranted that if you want the best, go for the open headphones. There comfort is important, but there are a lot less demands in terms of portability. One should have an open mind for closed, portable headphones, since there will be stuff lost.


It's total bullshit what people are paying now for headphones though. If people are paying for the niche $1,000 headphones though, for the most part, they are paying for future research in cheaper headphones though. To me, with the China crap, I can pay $200 and get a great headphone. I just wish some of the bigger, more reliable manufacturer's picked that up, and spent $100 or $200 extra dollars toward making a good design (or just used the M50x design and made a competent driver). Really, there needs to be more in the $200-$400 dollar range that is fully encompassing, like how that series for open headphones is a template for 90% of what one may be able to fully acquire for open headphones.

/Thanks for incompetent rant"
2628,"If interest is there and money to spend, why not get something nice~ 

Everyone should have a limit he wants to spend on a headphone. And you can find very solid options in every price bracket and in every category.

So I wouldn't advise someone to buy a 300$ headphone, even though he could spend a ""kilobuck"" on his first pair. You wouldn't buy anything expensive without having a listen before or the option to send the item back anyways (or at least you shouldn't ;))

At least thats my opinion  á¶˜ áµ’á´¥áµ’á¶…

Further I think that fullsize-sealed and portable options kinda go together because if you would care for portability you'd go with earphones anyway.
I've seen several people walking around with M50s, Dt770s and HD-25s on the streets/bus/train/plane/... None of them overly portable but they seem to work wonderfully."
2629,"edit: nevermind :)

Don't hate on the E100 til you try it!

I didn't have high expectations for it since it was just 12 dollars, but after buying them they have set a new bar for IEMs/Earbuds for me. They crushed all my other earbuds no contest. I used to hate listening on the go since I was used to the sound from my HE-400s. While the E100 aren't as good as the hifimans, the don't make me regret going outside. Very worth trying for 12 dollars.

I'd love to see a video of you reviewing the E100s! (go into it with low expectations and youll be surprised)"
2630,Oh I don't doubt it's good lol. I just think the Baldoor worship is more amusing (and makes sense) in the context of its price.
2631,"It's less ""worship"" and more ""circlejerk"", really. While the E100 has some fans, most of the people who reference it are making fun of the fuss made over it."
2632,"*Haha, you found a $12 earbud that sounds good!*"
2633,"Oooh ok, that makes sense now! I misinterpreted it originally"
2634,Around $12 for Earbuds
2635,free
2636,"Depends. I think that there's one fairly sweet spot for iems around $50 (where the Meelec A151, VSD3s etc are significantly better than anything cheaper). Idk about the iems you mentioned. IMO the JVC FXD80 (for less than $70) is almost 90% as good as any of the iems you mentioned. And the westone um3x is definitely a solid step up worthy of the extra money from those iems. 

Dunno about headphones. Im about to buy my first pair of DT880 600 ohm in a day or two, glad to hear you think its the sweet spot. I do forsee it as my endgame for atleast the next 5-7 years. I'll upgrade amps and speakers in the mean while."

2740,"Is Arctis Pro Wireless still the only choice after all these years if I want to connect to two devices simultaneously via wireless and bluetooth?

Honestly I'm not a pro-gamer whatsover who need to hear every pin drop at perfect precision. Being wireless itself is a good enough qol feature to me over many other stuff, as long as I can hear the game sound and voicechat normally. 

This is actually coming from an ex-Arctis Pro Wireless user looking for replacement. The transmitter just died suddenly (not recognisible by any console) after ~2 years. I enjoyed the experience, but just not really confident enough in buying the same product again."
2741,"I mean lots can do that they all just suck, including the arctis pro.

The Penrose can also do that."
2742,"A year later and it's all still the same... Disappointing

Edit: Has technology really not gone forward?"
2743,"Wireless tech is not the issue. Wireless tech is good.

The companies making gaming headsets are just making bad wired headsets so once there made into something wireless quality goes down and price goes up.

The companies are the issues not the tech."
2744,"gosh I wish I came across this earlier. About to throw my g933 into the bin and back to wired. The headset is such a joke, the sound gets crackling when there are more than 2 audio sources running and constantly disconnect too. Thank you for this post!"
2745,"New wireless post coming coon on my main sub.

Do note the conclusion is the same."
2747,I don't recommend vss in general. Not atmos and not sonic.

Still working some things out."
2750,Does your GSP 370 disconnect like the others? I want to buy one but that DC bug is a deal breaker for me
2751,It didn't during my testing.
2753,I most likely will not be adding It.
2754,Itâ€™s no good compared to the G935?
2755,Just not worth it's cost.
2756,"u/LifelongCaboose would you pin this to the main thread as there's a lot of console wireless questions. I realize you're not a fan of these products, but your work in looking at this and educating people is worth pinning to main page."
2757,This is in the guide.
2758,"The regular Cloud Flight doesn't have mic monitoring/sidetone, which was a deal breaker for me. Its software is also terrible with no EQ option---nothing besides volume/mute/battery level. Such a shame because I liked it besides that.

The Cloud Flight S is supposed to remedy this by adding sidetone, but it's not clear whether the software will be any better for these. Is there an EQ option that magically appears when you plug in the Flight S instead of the regular Flights? I'm also wary of the complaints about really bad 7.1 sound and white noise, which wasn't present at all on the Cloud Flight."
2759,"Gaming software EQ is terrible and not even worth using so that's a non issue. If your on pc too use the software just get APO if you want to eq your headphone.

It's also a pretty poorly tuned headphone as well.

The flight s has a much better stock tuning but still meh.

99% of 7.1 vss is garbage so that's a non issue"
2760,"I know they're old, but what do you think of the Razer Man O War? I have a set that I'm looking to change out for something else but I really appreciate the wireless factor as I have pet parrots that love chewing on wires. I keep reading that the sound and mic quality are huge problems with so many of these wireless headsets, but I've never had any issues with my headset as far as sound and mic quality. Am I judging from a lack of experience or did they just manage to get it right the one time? If it is just lack of experience, how much better/worse is the one I have than the options you listed here? I've been giving serious thought to the virtuoso but this gives me pause."
2761,"The man o war is awful. I'm also removing the Virtuoso from the list as it very bad but the mic rocks. And it's not worth itm

Wait for the Audeze Penrose."
2762,"I can't believe that, after such a long search and finally arriving at this thread, I end up with the knowledge that I've unconsciously chosen the best option... two years ago.

Seriously? For two years nothing better than Cloud Flight appeared on the market?

They're okay for me, good for gaming and voip, but they're missing one thing that'd make them golden: ANC. I tried to use them in open space at the office, and the lack of noise isolation/ANC clearly shows. I can't get back to a wired headset, so I guess I'll just stop searching and accept that there's no wireless headset with ANC and decent mic, which does NOT rely on ancient Bluetooth HSP/HFP."
2763,"Anc isn't good for gaming sadly it's why most companies don't mess with it. It negativity affects not only audio quality but also gaming preformance.

RF wireless is honestly dying.

Bluetooth is so much more advanced and better, it will be the future of wireless. For headsets it is limited for bandwidth for a good mic."
2764,"What I can't understand is where that limitation comes from. Why can't Bluetooth introduce a profile that combines A2DP with the way, way outdated HFP?

It's using the same 2.4 GHz as the dongle Cloud Flight uses, yet it can't handle good quality voice calls. It's baffling to me."
2765,"Bluetooth focuses on audio quality first. Mic quality second.

2.4GHz wireless has similar issues and limitations which it's why audio quality is never great and mic quality always sucks.

Bluetooth Atleast leans to what's important. Gaming company's kinda half ass both."
2766,"What about bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL?

Is there anything good out there in the price range you explored within your guide?

I was considering to get a creative BT-W2 to plug in my pc plus a pair of headphones that could benefit from that (I already have a stand alone mic for discord chats).   
Still not sure what to pick, I always used cheap headphones so far. I'd like improvement in sound quality now that I have some budget, while keeping it wireless.

&#x200B;

From your list it seems that the G935 should be my best option (the GSP670 is way out of budget, I only find them at 300/350 euros)."
2767,"I don't have a Bluetooth guide up yet. But overall not many options.

The backbeats pro 2 is ok, but not for fps.

I also didn't find the bt-w2 to be that good. I had connection issues with it."
2768,"Thanks for the reply, I'll keep the backbeats pro 2 in consideration!

2770,"The gsp670 does offer simultaneous Bluetooth.

The quantum 800 and arctis pro wireless don't sound very good and I can't recommend them.

But in general if your going wireless your not getting a good mic or good sound."
2771,"Do you mean you can't recommend them?

I know I'm sacrificing by going wireless, I'm looking for the least bad option here."
2772,"I updated it just after I commented it.

Sadly with wireless there is no best of the worst. It's just some to 1 thing well and everything else bad.

Gsp670, no simultaneously Bluetooth but good sound and build. Not great connection, not great comfort, bad mic. Overpriced. 

Arctis pro wireless, good features, good connection, not very good audio, bad mic, poor build, bad comfort unless you have small ears and a small head, poor durability. Very overpriced.

That's kinda the story for them all."
2773,Appreciate the help.
2774,"Maybe itâ€™s been tested and itâ€™s crap, but have you tested the Creative SXFI Theater?"
2775,"Understood :)

So letâ€™s say, I wanted to get the Bowers & Wilkins PX 7 with a aptX LL Bluetooth adapter + Modmic Wireless, it would beat all of these headsets?"
2776,"I wouldn't ever recommend buying the px7

It also doesn't support aptx LL. So buying a Bluetooth headphone then using it wired into a aptx LL adapter makes no sense as that would be the ultimate way to spend a ton of many for terrible sound."
2777,"I was using the PX7 as an example (based on the reviews it doesn't seem too bad) let me re-phrase this up then, let's say that I would get a pair of Bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL, would that then beat all of these headsets?"
2778,"Depends which one. The px7 I wouldn't take even over some of these as bad as they are. 

There isn't many aptx LL headphones. But if you could get a good one then of course."

 Internet is garbage in this house despite ethernet and nbn.  Microwave disrupts the signal enough to cause lag.  Did you still have connection problems with the g1wl or were they resolved?  Am i just better off saving my dosh and going with the better bang for buck hs70?
Side note is the g1wl sound really that bad? The hyperx revolver s was the best headset ive had so i havent had an audiophile experience before to set a high bar.  If its that underwhelming i might replace them with g935s on the shortlist as they are the same price here.
Edit: was the hs70 the pro or non pro edition?"
2785,"The g1wl sound quality is average at best the issue is the tuning, it's super bassy and either slightly bright or ear bleeding bright. It was rough.

The hs70 sound wise isn't half bad the issue with it is the connection and qc issues."
2786,"I saw your comments on other threads saying that you were contacting audiotechnica about the g1wl dropping out too around 5mo ago.  Is the connection failure a common theme across headsets (due to both having dongles across a 2.4GHz freq) or was there one which was more stable than the other?
That is the first ive heard of the hs70 having connection problems"
2787,The g1 and gsp670 has the same issues.
2788,Why for the love of all that's good sir did you not reveal yourself a week ago before I'd spent $200+ on an ill-advised venture.... Mixed emotions cause I'm happy to find this but inevitably remorseful from the  knowledge that I've learnt from it.
2789,"I mean it's been up for a month.

You can't return it?"
2790,"I don't know how I didn see this,  becaus I could actually but just needed the to hear the truth haha"
2791,I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??
2792,Neither are very good. I don't recommend either if you care about sound quality. But wireless in general is bad for quality .
2793,"Thanks for this reply, the page and your hard work btw.
Among the ocean of dis and misinformation when buying tech like tjisy your work and he professionalism you do here is a service ...and you are a mensch and a scholar"
2794,"I knew it was a big sacrifice for the wireless option but as far as wireless standards, I thought the 2.4ghz were the only decent option around..... at the risk of sounding ignorant thought, is the wired option i.e USBC to 3.5mm included a viable option or is the quality dependant on the headset and not connection?

2795,"Would you recommend aptx HD over the aptx low latency? And does Bluetooth aptx in general sound better than any wireless gaming headset 2.4ghz wireless out there?

Iâ€™m thinking of getting a good wireless headphone that could go together with the Modmic Wireless based on your recommendation."
2796,"Bluetooth has too much latency for gaming.

Only aptx LL and aptx adaptive have low enough latency for gaming or movies."
2797,"Ok thanks, I've just been reading that Bluetooth still has compression with aptX HD or aptX LL, with lower delays for LL but it still doesn't come near in terms of audio quality compared to a 2.4 ghz USB dongle connection? I'm just curious then why you would recommend a Bluetooth over it."
2798,"Bluetooth tends to sound better because companies that make good audio use Bluetooth.

2.4ghz isn't great and all the rf options super suck."
2799,"> aptX LL

Is this a hardware or software change? If I am interested in the Audeze Mobius, are they able to get updates to this standard later, or it is something built in and as this new technology comes around, you have to upgrade to do it?"
2800,"Hardware.

If the headset doesn't have the chip in it it never will."
2802,How much for them?
2804,Hs70 sounds better. Flight has less issues.
2806,"I didn't have any low volume issues on the mic. You may have something set up incorrectly. 

The flight and flight s are also better than most other wireless gaming headset.

All wireless gaming headsets suck, it's not about getting one that's good, it's about getting one that doesn't completely suck and the cloud flight and flight s sound good enough to make up for the issues."
2807,"I've got an old wired Logitech H390 that I've used for years, but is starting to go out in 1 ear. Last November I got a cat, and it would just be so much easier to interact with the cat if my headphones are wireless. I'm not really a music listener and just need something for generic MMO/MOBA game audio and Push to Talk Discord chat. I was fine with the Logitech H800's sound/mic, but the foam pads gave me a scab on my ear... Seems like ""decent overall"" would fit what I'm looking for, so initially leaning to the MH670. By high clamp do you mean it strongly squeezes the sides of your head? Would you also say mic monitoring is important for someone who has only used on ear not over ear headsets? In that case maybe the Cloud Flight might be better? I really wish there was just a wireless version of the H390. Maybe I need to be looking more at office headsets, but they all seem to be Bluetooth or $300+"
2808,"Why do you recommend the Cloud Flight S is you haven't tested it yet? I'm looking to buy it, but the white noise issue is holding me back."
2809,I got the cloud flight and it's honestly pretty solid. Battery life is pretty good and the mic is surprisingly good. Some people in game have actually asked me if I'm a streamer because of the mic quality but take that with a grain of salt. Like 5/10 comfort. Haven't had any latency issues tbh
2810,"Because from everything I can see sound wise the flight s is the same as the flight the tuning shape is unchanged it just dropped a few dB making it a more listen able headset.

The white noise should be the same as the flight."
2811,"Hello Caboose, I do have MH670 and can't quite find good EQ for it tbh. What's your EQ settings?"
2812,"Selam, Sizde MH751 de mi var ?"
2813,"Selam, evet MH751â€™im var."
2814,How are you liking your 670s so far? Any crosstalk or hissing?
2815,"No cross talk or hissing but I cant say I like how it sounds. Other than that; comfort, battery life all good."
2816,I'm on the fence about buying these. Liking the lack of LEDs and the battery life. How bad is the sound? I'm on Corsair H1500's just now (complete with horrible background whine and excessive volume bugs).
2817,"I do have Cloud Core, MH751, Game One and MH670. 670 is the worst among these imo. I had Cloud Flight for a while it was better sounding, but comfort was worse."
2818,"Sadly I need a wireless set. If I had the budget for the GSP's I'd grab them. I'd love to actually hear a set of the 670's before buying. 

Going from these reviews I preferred the [mic quality of the MH670's](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cooler-master-mh670/7.html) comapred to the [Cloud Flight](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/hyperx-cloud-flight/6.html)"
2819,"I don't use it regularly, when I judge headsets I use them stock first, then slowly try to flatten them with Eq. But that's not really good for gaming. But I didn't save my eq for it. Also do not use the cooler master eq."
2820,"I'm EQ'ing them from Microsoft Sound Control Panel. I also have MH751, I tried to make 670 sound like 751 but couldn't do it. They're definitely step down from 751."
2821,"Eq can't change sound quality only FR.

Use APO and peace and make sure you understand how to compensate with pre amp gain."
2822,Been using the Corsair HS70...yeah the earpads cushion is failing on me slowly peeling off and I see that it can't be replaced. What about SteelSeries Arctis 1 and Asus ROG Strix GO 2.4?
2823,Do you have hissing on your HS70?
2824,Nope...you need to go to the iCue software and dial down the sidetone
2825,If it's not on the list I don't recommend them.
2826,If I don't care about mic quality or audio quality but want a wireless headset with a mic and the longest battery life possible without spending thousands of quid what is the best headset for me? I got a wireless Bluetooth headset from Sony when it was on sale for Â£35. Battery lasts for 20 hours and it has a built in internal mic which is nice cause you can wear it normally and not look too weird. Are there any headsets with maybe a month battery life or are they quite expensive?
2827,"This is for wireless gaming headsets. Not Bluetooth headphones.

Also no, there isn't something that lasts a month. 20-30 hours is the average."
2828,I meant wireless headsets obviously though many Wireless headsets are Bluetooth.
2829,"The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10-20.

The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the gsp370. Which is closer to 100hours 

Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth.

Wireless headphones are Bluetooth. Often called headsets but that's just because they have a built in call grade mic. Not good for gaming. Bad mic quality and too high of latency."
2830,Thats unfortunate. I couldn't find many headsets beyond 20 hours though sony do have a 35 hour headset. On sale for Â£40 which I had gotten that now instead of my 20 hour headset for Â£35 lol.
2835,What does N/A mean?
2836,Not applicable. Only used on the Virtuoso because it's sucks in almost everyway. But has the best mic on a wireless gaming headset. But it sounds bad and isn't built to well and isn't very comfortable.
2837,The virtuoso is the leat comfortable headset I've ever worn
2838,"Loving your honest reviews of these products, thanks for your efforts man. Keep seeing the Virtuoso being recommended everywhere but my experience with their H2100 & H1500 has sworn me off them for life. Glad to hear they're shite."
2839,"Completely Agree, thank you for the being Straight with it. My dad was trying to recommend wireless but I told him Iâ€™ll re-purpose this headset for gaming after all these quarantine video calls for work.

Wired is a much better investment."
2889,\+1 Go with the [PC38X](https://reddlink.tech/sennheiser-pc38x)... EXCELLENT headphones and i love that they are open back.
2890,Get the hd560s. Or pc38x for pure gaming performance. DT990 can hurt for a lot of people due to the piercing treble. Both of the options mentioned can be ran off mobo audio or through the apple dongle.
2891,"Another vote for pc38x, I've had them since they came out. I think they're super comfortable, personally I like open ear headphones for gaming because I still like to hear what's going on around me while I play games."
2892,"This. And for OP, if you want to have an amp to get the most out of future headphones (of which may or may not need more power), you can consider a few budget options: Schiit Hel, Schiit Fulla 4, iFi Zen DAC (or V2), FiiO K5 Pro, etc. All listed are DAC/AMP singular units, which act as a DAC and AMP all together. Not the best of both worlds but it's a great start and opens up many more headphone options. For gaming, get the Schiit Hel or Schiit Fulla 4 because they have a mic jack.

Disclaimer. I only own the iFi Zen DAC original, and I love it. Gives me plenty of volume with my HiFiMan HE400se (which I find meh for competitive gaming versus my Philips SHP9600)."
2893,"I also suggest the Sennheiser 560s. I use it myself and I play Apex and COD, very good imaging and sound quality."
2894,do you use a dac/amp? or straight from the pc?
2895,"I personally use a dac/amp, the JDS labs Element II, But you can easily run it off just the PC cuz my iPhone can run it fine"
2896,If u want gaming go full on Sennheiser. Honestly most of their gaming headphones sound pretty much the same. I am not aware of their top headphones for gaming but few years back Game zero was above average and still is a good choice.
2897,"Ohms are a unit of electrical resistance; the higher the resistance, the more voltage is required to push a given amount of current through a headphone. What (if any) headphone amp do you have? If you don't have one don't get the 250 ohms."
2898,"Exactly the opposite, for some reason you're being upvoted so some losers even believe you. 

IN A NUTSHELL: high impedance headphones require powerful source like a good DAC to provide enough power for such impedance. If you plan to use your headphones portable or overall for devices like smartphones, laptops, anything without DAC, just straight to the jack port, you should get as low impedance as possible to have them not demanding regarding the source. If you have a good DAC and you plan to use it only with it then you can for sure go ahead with high impedance. There is a THEORY that lighter coil (the higher the impedance, the thinner the coil so it's lighter) gets you slightly better sound. I don't believe in that, I don't know any blind tests where people could actually tell the difference so don't treat it as a rule.

To sum up, don't listen to this guy."
2899,"Iâ€™m confused. Not by high impedance and low
Impedanceâ€¦. But that you just disagreed with this original comment, then restated what he said but slightly different. 

He said if you donâ€™t have an amp to power the high impedance donâ€™t get the high impedance headphones. 

Only difference is you mentioned a DAC, which offers no power difference. A DACs job is literally what DAC stands for: digital audio converter. It converts digital audio to analog audio. An amplifier on the other hand amplifies your source to properly power headphones which is when impedance matters. 

If I plug my 300ohm HD800Sâ€™s into my DAC alone they will be insanely quiet because they arenâ€™t getting any power increase from my amplifierâ€¦. Now if I plug my DAC into my pc to convert the digital to analog, then plug my amp into my DAC, and my headphones into my amp, my headphones now can get so loud that some find the sound level too much. 

Idk if Iâ€™m explaining this incorrectly or if you donâ€™t know the difference between an amp and a DAC but either way the original comment is correct in my opinionâ€¦ if you donâ€™t have or donâ€™t plan on buying an amp, then donâ€™t get high impedance phones.

BTW: my friend has dt990P and a 50 dollar tube amp from Amazon powers his headphones surprising well and sounds great for the tiny cost."
2900,Both ohms and sensitivity are dependent on your amplifier. This is incorrect and is most likely a troll post.
2901,"Hard to say. Everyone is different.

I currently own Sennheiser HD58X, Philips Fidelio X2HR, Philips SHP9500 and AKG K702.

I found the 58X and X2HR not very good for FPS gaming where as they are recommended often (And why I bought them in the first place). The SHP9500 are better for gaming for me although no patch on the K702 imo."
2902,AKG K702 or 712 are awesome for gaming and object placement. The sound stage is huge
2903,difference between the 2? price difference of about $150.
2904,"The K612 Pros are also fantastic and arguably better for music than the 702/712s.

And cheaper in many places!"
2905,"Yeah but you might as well as go with sennheisers when you go down a tier.  The k702s are great for music, and are amazing for gaming.  They are $254 dollars on Newegg.  I wouldnâ€™t sacrifice detail for money. With headphones you need to make leaps not steps up.  With the k702 I can accurately place the virtual speaker arcs on Dolby headphone, using my asus xonar.  You wonâ€™t find better at this price."
2906,"Sure.  I'm planning to upgrade to either Sundaras or Arias at some point in the future.

The positional accuracy of the K612's are not to be underestimated, though, they are absolutely fantastic -- extremely flat with a huge soundstage.  I prefer them for gaming to the 400i's I use primarily for music."
2907,"I have the hifiman he500.  When I bought them, they were $799.99 and at the time, I was using the ultrasone pro 900 for gaming at night when my wife was sleeping and the k702 when open headphones could be used.  There is more detail in the hifimans but I canâ€™t really say that they have the positional accuracy for some reason. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s probably because of the bass in the he500 was definitely more prominent than the upper mids that are prominent in the k702. This is where most of the positional cues are."
2908,If you're considering the 990s might as well include the TYGR300 or MMX300 Gen 2 on that list. Never heard these two yet but those who heard them said that both images better than 990s. Plus also not having as much of that ear raping treble.
2909,He400se is really good for gaming especially fps
2910,"someone said that the akg 712 > dt1990 who is a valorant player. at least for fps games.

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/npefym/review_of_the_akg712pro_dt990pro_and_dt1990pro_as/)"
2911,"Depending on the type of gaming you are doing there are a few options. Most have been covered  in this post (tygr 300, akg 712), however, I donâ€™t see much here about the Sennheiser 599s. 

Personally I find the 599s to be excellent for shooters â€” their soundstage is incredibly large and full. It produces crisp footsteps that are not drowned out in the bass of gunfire and firefights will not stop you from pinpointing a single footstep given off by a lurker. 

For immersive Rpg/Arpg/Mmos I would recommend trying to hunt down the tygr 300r, as it will have a stronger ingame feel to it for these genres, however, the 599s will service you well in these types. 

I do not recommend the 599s for pop music, but they are excellent for classical, metal, rap, and rock.

As far as price tag goes, the 599 black model was 102 shipped and taxed on prime day a few weeks ago so you may find some great second hand deals on unopened ones. Otherwise, it still punches above its weight for its price class at its retail â€” personally I have the SE which are beige, but for my friends I got them the black models when they were on sale. 

Hopefully this helps in your journey! If you have more questions feel free to ask.

Edit: I forgot to add, the 599s will not need a DAC/Amp which is part of why I chose them, although they can certainly be juiced."
2912,"I currently have DT990 pro 250ohms with fiio k5 pro and want to upgrade my headphones because I have a problem when gunfire appears - i cant pinpoint any footsteps. Do you think 599 will be better than dt990 pro? Also consideting hd58x, hd6xx, hifimans"
2913,"I have no issues on Valorant with pinpointing footsteps during things like Odinspam or intense firefights. It should be more than servicable. I have not tried those alternatives, as I found the 599Se were perfect for my usage (casting and fps)."
2914,"Hi.. I'm planning to get the 599 SE as well but I have been hearing mixed reviews saying they are muddy, veiled, takes time to get used to etc. What were first impressions when you got them? Are these your first open back headphones?"
2915,"These were my first opens, however, I got a few others to try them (akg712, dt 8xx, 6xx) and make my decision (these were the first of the batch that came in and I put them on first as well, certainly adds bias). 

I have not found them to be muddy or veiled, nor do they have a burn in period (imo). I have one pair myself but I purchased two more during prime day for my best friend and father and tried theirs as well. They sounded virtually identical (I may not be able to hear the difference if there is one) when I tried them (I was wondering about that mythical â€˜burn inâ€™ myself). 

Compared to my previous â€˜gamingâ€™ headsets they are like crystal perfection as well. I previously utilized Cloud 9 hyperx Alphas (different models, revolver, rev s, etc) and a few other astro/steel series models. 

I will say the easiest explanation for clarity is this:
I listen to a lot of classical and in, for example, tchaikovsky I can pick out the individual elements of the orchestra and where they are on the stage itself. Additionally, in shooters, I can pick out exactly where footsteps come from on a site. 

I think the bass may be jarring for some people â€” it is not as guttural/boomy as a â€˜gamerâ€™ headset, instead being more throaty and pealing out in individual notes. But if you are looking for a thump thump/wub wub you are probably going to want a different headset, as this is much more equipped for tonality, trebles, mids, and soundstage."
2916,"Thanks a lot for your detailed experience! 

I don't prefer headphones with crazy bass.. like you mentioned tonality, mids, overall resolution and soundstage is what matters. So yeah, I'm more assured to get them now. Thanks!"
2917,"I have the DT990s and I absolutely love them for gaming and music. Super comfortable, clear audio, and great soundstage. Get a nice amp and never look back."
2918,"k371 m8
strong treble and gr8 imaging"
2919,you should get the Phillips Fidelio X2HR you would love them and they are very affordable.
2920,"+1 for the Fidelios.

I ordered and returned a few headphones including the dt990 and the dt770 and ended up keeping the Fidelios, the clarity is amazing and they don't need an amplifier."
2921,tbh i find the DT 770 a little bit superior if you tend to listen to more music.
2922,"The difference is only if you work in a studio and need certain impedance for certain source devices. That's the only reason they make it in various impedance versions. 99,99% people could never tell any difference between these and if they say they do, they lie. So for your convenience get lower impedance version which needs less input power to get them working good. Regarding gaming, I have always been playing using closed headphones, mainly Counter-Strike where positioning of footsteps etc. is very important. I have mostly used Audio Technica SJ5 and currently Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250Ohm). People have been surprised on several occasions how much and early I was able to hear and I also feel pretty confident about it so I say closed design is nothing but good for the purpose."
2923,"Other comments here are great, second them.

Imma say 559s suck, 599s and 560s are way better."
2924,..what
2925,what..
2926,..what?
2927,what..?
2928,"I'd say go for the HarmonicDyne Zeus. Big soundstage and good imaging, great for gaming and music and movie watching, it's a good option. It costs $350, however."
2929,try danon d7200
2930,"Yea, I think I have the same recs, if you budget is under 200$, get the pc38x, if you can pay up a little more, 560s + dac/amp in one (k5 pro), then you will be in very good hands."
2931,"shp9500, affordable and excellent soundstage for everything gaming, don't need anything else"
2932,"I have HD559 and strongly recommend against them, as they are nothing like my previous HD555. The HD559 have lower sound quality, are muddy and far in a blanketed way. Since HD579 aren't sold anymore I would start with HD599 and up.

And no, that is not a Sennheiser sound if someone will try to tell you that. The HD555 were crisp and spacious with mid-low boost that made bass soft, bow strings flowing and added a bit of punch to electric guitars. The HD595 which are now known as HD599 are very similar, but sound even a bit more spacious."
2933,"My personal roster for headphones are hd8xx(launching around nov similar to hd800s), k712 pro, k7XX, pc38x and tygr300r. My personal favorite os the pc38x because it just does everything and does it lovely,  is so airy and punchy, yet enough detail and warm to heard it all day but its kindy stiff at the start so I changed pads to brainwavz fenestraied, tygrs are bit less in mid range, k712 is not that punchy and requires good amp (but one of the best all rounder and detailed) and any hd800 is way to expensive for just gaming but still the best death precision imaging i have tried. Pc38x just earned my respects for its price and easy of use. With pc38x/pc37x being so good for gaming I see no reason to look at the 500 series."
2934,"I tested quite a few headphones in terms of Apex Legends (over the last 2 years and testing some that are not my own, didnt buy them all :D)

- Sennheiser HD 599
- Sennheiser HD 560s
- Focal Clear MG Pro
- Focal Elegia (also with dekoni pads)
- Beyerdynamic DT 770 250 ohm
- Beyerdynamic DT 990 250 ohm
- Hyperx Cloud II
- Superluxx HD681
- Koss Porta Pro

my very subjective top ranks, while I can't realistically sort them all, would be:
1. Focal Elegia
2. Sennheiser HD 560s
3. Focal Clear MG Pro"
2935,The pc38x and Tygr 300r are amazing for comp FPS gaming. The former coming with a mic. Both can be run with or without an amp.
2936,"Remind me of this article from notebookcheck. They asked OEMs, who basically answers ""consumers don't care"" : https://www.notebookcheck.net/It-s-2020-and-laptops-still-have-1-MP-cameras-What-gives.453549.0.html"
2937,"So this article came out in february of that year, before COVID. I wonder if the answer is different now. A lot of people suddenly got very interested in webcams."
2938,"Yeah but the answer is still somewhat the same. 99% of laptops were still designed and produced before people started to care about them. I'd look at that spec now, but previously i would not have cared.

Furthermore, with the current shortages and the spike in demand for laptops, the pressure to innovate isn't quite there at the moment, so it might still be a while until better cameras become standard."
2939,"The reason Webcams in laptops are so terrible is the limited space for a lens assembly. Cell phones are thicker the lid of most notebooks, plus, they can get away with camera bumps. without a lens assembly, the size of the sensor becomes limited too, and auto-focus is not possible either. I'm not sure if it was Linus or Hardware Canucks who made a video about that."
2940,"It's the same with microphones. People don't consume the content of their own webcam, thus they don't care. It has to be so bad that others complain about it before they would start looking for improvements.

At least that's my take on the situation

That being said, it surprises me that notebook manufacturers don't use them as a way to differentiate their product."
2942,"Plus everyone is shrunk down to a tiny square except the presenter.  So if you're just a drone listening to some nonsense, you don't care what quality your feed is because you don't want to be there to begin with."
2943,"Additional in a meeting you don't want the best video quality for the participants. Number one is audio and number two is share screen quality.

When the quality of the audio and share screen drops I suggest to everyone to turn off their video."
