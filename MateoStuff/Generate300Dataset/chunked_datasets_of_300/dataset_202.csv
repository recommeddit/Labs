66763,"Yeah but part of that will surely be that in a few years, Tammy should still maintain his value, in part because he's English"
66764,"Yup, the “English tax” will still be there if a club from England tries to bring him back in the future"
66765,well we have a buy back clause
66766,"In part, but the fact he is only 23 and had some decent pedigree before going to Roma helps more."
66767,Never rooted for another team as much as I am for Roma with Jose and Tammy. Go on and win this Scudetto.
66768,"Yeah I’ve noticed a lot of Chelsea fans backing us, it’s a nice contrast to the United and Spurs fans"
66769,"I am going full Roma this year, go win the title with our best manager ever! Good luck!"
66770,"Felt the same way. When Lukaku went to Inter, Chelsea and Everton fans I saw on Twitter wished him good luck while United fans just made fun of his weight (not all, just the ones I saw sadly). Shame people have these agendas and can't move on"
66771,"If Tammy goes on to crush it for you (very good chance), then you can sell him back to a PL club for 60m+ precisely because he’s English."
66772,"Gomez is quality, just injured lol"
66773,"Could argue being injured should lessen his value, tbf. Hard to say what he'll be like when back fit, and whether it'll have affected his prospects and fitness long term. Adds a slight 'unknown quantity' aspect to the rest of his career, which you could argue should take some of his value off. We know that very promising younger players in the past have had careers derailed by serious injuries like Gomez suffered. Although of course plenty have recovered and gone on to have brilliant careers too - but it does remain a risk."
66774,Most of these players would be valuable just because they're very young.
66775,"Only Trent, Hendo, Foden, Sancho Grealish, Sterling, Kane and maybe Mount are (potentially) world class, most others are just very expensive for being English. France definetly has a better and more valuable pool of players by quite a lot."
66776,"Out of the top 8, only Portugal never won a world cup. And unless I'm mistaken only Uruguay is a world cup winner not in the top 8."
66777,"Watch us break it next year with Santosball.
/s"
66778,"I'm pretty sure that Uruguay is the only country with a population lower than 40 or 50 million to have ever won a World Cup and this was ages ago. Considering their population size, Portugal and the Netherlands have done really well over the years. The European Championship is also dominated by the same bigger countries."
66779,"Argentina had 27 million people in 1978, and 30 million in 1986. Both years in which it won the World Cup. It currently has 45 million people.

[Source.](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/argentina-population/)"
66780,"I'm using the current population numbers to compare the relative size of countries. It's just to illustrate how  difficult it is for smaller countries to win. I'm sure some other countries had much lower populations as well at some point when they won the World Cup, but that wasn't really my point."
66781,"No we haven’t won a World Cup either, 3 final losses unfortunately"
66782,"For those who don't care to look it up, it's the Netherlands ('74, '78, '10)
(Although they're not in the Top 8)"
66783,It should have been us :(
66784,England players are expensive mainly because most of them play in the Premier league.
66785,Well you get nearly a 1/10 of that value from grealish alone.
66786,And Kane makes up 3/10 if you ask our boy Levy.
66787,Please use his proper title- The Big Master of Negotiations Who Knows Everything
66788,At least haha
66789,And because the FA sets quotas for home grown players. Thus artificially inflating their worth
66790,"Some of the Danish national players should get a higher value.

Andreas Christensen is the second highest valued Dane for €30m. But that doesn't even make him a top 50 most expensive Defender on Transfermarkt.  

For example Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma who are both older than Andreas Christensen and didn't make the Chelsea team are valued higher on Transfermarkt than Andreas Christensen."
66791,At €19m and €20m Maehle and Damsgaard are also quite lowballed in terms of value
66792,I think these values are from when he had one year on his deal which has a pretty significant impact
66793,"> Andreas Christensen is the second highest valued Dane for €30m. But that doesn't even make him a top 50 most expensive CB on Transfermarkt.

I couldnt believe thats true so i checked and it actually isnt; actually Christensen is tied to the 31th most valuable CB together with Akanji, Mancini, Gomez, Mings, Stones and Ginter."
66794,Sorry I meant defender not CB
66795,">Andreas Christensen is the second highest valued Dane for €30m. But that doesn't even make him a top 50 most expensive Defender on Transfermarkt. 

>For example Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma who are both older than Andreas Christensen and didn't make the Chelsea team are valued higher on Transfermarkt than Andreas Christensen.

The  Danish Maldini has been class for us ever since TT came in taken over Silvas spot with ease"
66796,Today I learned: Christensen is younger than Ake
66797,Ake looks really young. But he is actually turning 27 this February
66798,That's a really good point. Denmark is currently a better side than Serbia and I'd even argue Croatia.
66799,"Even if they are this is valuation of 23 player squad and their club performances, age, club, lesgue etc. It doesn't really reflect on which team would beat which. It's simply not related to that."
66800,Denmark has an actual competent coach.
66801,"I was reading all of this thread thinking it was about Anders Christiansen and was like ?????  
  
I'm drunk."
66803,"Gimenez is a great great defender, it's Christensen that's under-valued not Gimenez that's over-valued."
66804,"If it weren't for injuries, you'd see Gimenez as world class."
66805,"If not for the fact that I’m not tall, you’d see me as super tall."
66806,"Mean while van Gaal says: 'The Netherlands is no longer a top nation, so we shouldn't expect those results anymore'. Fuck off really, we should qualify easily for every big tournament at bare minimum."
66807,"The Dutch national team has so many good players though, Virgil, De Ligt, Dumfries, Wijnaldum, Memphis, Bergwijn, De Vrij, Frenkie De Jong.."
66808,"Problem is almost all of our top players are good in the center. We lack good wingers/wingbacks, only Dumfries is good if we play 5atb."
66809,Whatever happened to Quincy Promes? I do think Bergwijn could become a pretty good winger but he struggled for spurs last year
66810,He stabbed someone (allegedly).
66811,Jesus
66812,"No, that was the Romans."
66813,Fucking lol.
66814,Fled to Russia
66815,"I already think Bergwijn is a very good winger, he's just struggled a little with his finishing in the last season. But the best football Spurs played under Mourinho was when Bergwijn was a regular starter. He missed some key chances but his movement and work rate was brilliant, and he set up good chances for others that they failed to finish.

He's got all the qualities and attitude of a very good winger, and his finishing in training is apparently fantastic, so I just hope it's a matter of time before that translates to getting 10+ goals in a season at some point soon."
66816,"Only our attack really is lacking, but we should still easily qualify. Van Gaal is just trying to downplay the negative press he will get if we fail to qualify for the world cup."
66817,Our attack is a bit lacking though. Depay isn't a super star.
66818,i would say it's far better than denmark's attack and they do quite well.
66819,"Denmark have a better system and the players have clear roles and chemistry. With that a team can be bigger than the sum of its parts. 

Netherlands feels like France."
66820,"You could argue that’s what the holland fans want though, for the system to make it work with clear roles and chemistry…"
66821,Lol how could you put Dumfries with the rest of those names??
66822,Pep Guardiola to England here we go confirmed
66823,Going by that what the PL spent this season they could have bought all but 1 national team which is the England team...
66824,I would be interested to see a time lapse video of the value changes for teams over the last 20 years
66825,"https://youtu.be/TrSFf3FiIw0

Something like this?"
66826,"Damn, yes! Well played. Thanks"
66827,"A few of our players are undervalued I feel. Particularly Paredes, Lo Celso, Molina and A. Correa"
66828,"Yeah, I feel like we should be like top 5"
66829,Players like Ben White going for 50m is the only reason why England is at the top of the list.
66830,"This is based off of Transfermarkt’s valuations, not actual transfer fees."
66831,"Transfermarkt's valuations are a assessment of market value, not intrinsic value or whatever."
66832,Yeah it comes down to a plethora of factors. Ben White is valued at £25mil on there and has been for months. Him being bought for £50mil hasn’t had any effect on the value shown in this post.
66833,"Yeah according to transfermrkt white is only worth £25m. So only half of that actual transfer fee, England cost so much as they have lots of very talented young forward players mostly."
66834,"They are also a top 5 national team (at least) and most of their best players are young attackers which are the most expensive kind of player. Any team with Sancho, Mount, Rashford, Foden, Sterling, Kane, Grealish, Bellingham, Saka and Calvert Lewin all at the same time is obviously going to be worth an astronomical amount of money.

A lot of France's best players are defenders, and some of their best in other positions are on their way to 30 or over that which decreases their value."
66835,"England has ridiculous depth tbf.

Your RB gets injured and you suddenly have semedo playing in the first 11 lol."
66836,Ricardo Pereira and Cancelo ahead of Semedo is not bad. We just unlucky last euros with Ricardo Pereira injured and Cancelo getting covid.
66837,Unlucky with the group more than anything.
66838,I know he hasn’t been there for a while but Ricardo surely
66839,"Ricardo Pereira is injured, and Nelson Semedo is much better than people give him credit for"
66840,"Russia in the mud. 
Russia population=144m
Croatia population=4m"
66841,"Yeah but tbf the Russian league makes things weird about the Russian NT. Their player just don't ever go abroad since they have their own version of the English tax where they must have some number of Russians in a team. Every good Russian just stays at one of the bigger teams cause they're on massive wages there. 

Think about it: your average Croat/Serb has a very solid progression in his career playing for all kinds of teams and developing along the way. The Russian hits a Zenit or CSKA Moscow and that's the end of that. Why would they go to a Borrusia or a West Ham when they make as much money playing easier football?"
66842,If Yugoslavia were still unified they’d be so elite
66843,"Their Basketball team would be suuuper elite. Could probably compete with the US. Sad that Greece isn't part of that, one physical freak like Giannis in a team made up of elite shooters and passers and they're probably even favorites. That region is seriously underrated when it comes to sports."
66844,"Yeah they’ve got hella bball talent (RIP Dragen Petrovic btw...guy was gonna be an all time hall of famer). The Joker and Luka obv, my guy goran dragic, Nurkic, Poku, Bjelica, both Bogdanovic’s, Saric, Zubac, mirotic, this young kid named Jovic who’s supposed to be good, etc."
66845,Dražen*
66846,"Sport? Yes.

Politics? Hell no."
66847,They were great in both until they weren't.
66848,Tito was as elite as it gets
66849,English tax is inflating the english team’s value. French team should take the top spot imo.
66850,"France in Fifa21 is a cheat code, just saying"
66851,"How is Serbia so high, even higher than last world cup's second place.

I'm honestly curious i recognize Bosnian and Croatian players but no Serbians unless i'm forgetting people."
66852,"Our best players are quite old so their value isn't high, whereas bunch of younger ones don't play for top clubs. Serbia has Vlahovic and SMS probably who raise value a lot."
66853,"exactly. our team has few players in prime years at the moment (25-29 age range). it's either players over 30 who's value has dropped or players in early 20s who didn't reach future value yet. starters in prime years are basically just livi, kova and broz."
66854,Disrespect to Krama no matter how shit he seems to be for NT
66855,"SMS, Jovic, Vlahovic, Milenkovic."
66856,"SMS, Kostic, Jovic, Vlahovic, Tadic from the top of my head."
66857,"Man i forgot about Jovic, big brainfart."
66858,You are probably not alone
66859,They have a lot of 9-20 million players and a couple of very expensive players. Just a neat distribution of value across the team. Better than to have one £100m player like Wales did for a while.
66860,I think most of the worth is Milinkovic-Savic and Jovic
66861,Im also honestly curious how u recognize Bosnian players but not Serbian?
66862,Most of the players in the ENG national team are way overpriced
66863,I wish they would use names instead of shapes and flags for us Americans on here. They don’t teach us that other countries exist.
66864,"You're probably joking, but in case you aren't: England, France, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Netherlands, Belgium, Serbia, Croatia."
66865,"England has a 25 man squad while France has a 23 man one, could explain why England is at the top. Besides a lot of highly valued players of french team (cf. pogba and Mbappé) are in the last year of their contract, lowering their market value"
66866,"That's not how Transfermarkt works. It's the same value regardless of their contract duration.

Also doubt France has 2 players missing worth a combined €140M."
66867,"i think it is worth mentioning though that its not the best/most expensive squads other than the different number of players.  
france could swap in upamencano (60mil), camavinga (55mil), dembele (55mil), mendy (50mil), ndombele (50mil) and l.hernandez (45mil).  
but england is also not counting rashford (85mil), foden (80mil) or maddison (55mil) here"
66868,1.185 Sweden
66869,Absolute disgrace England isn't number 1. Did you see that 2006 squad?
66870,Gazza is rolling in his grave
66872,/s
66873,"Top 4 can't be debated.

Who deserves #5 is where the discussion begins."
66874,"5th was the only one I had to think about it, yeah.

Gave it to the Netherlands, but it was a close call vs France. 

Spain vs Uruguay for 7th place is another battle, which I could see going either way."
66875,Had a hard time picking between Netherlands and Spain. I gave Spain the edge due to the World Cup... but even thinking about it now I’m not sure if that was the right call
66876,"I actually picked France #5.

Zidane meltdown aside, if they win 2006 you're looking at a completely different legacy for the National side. Historically they've done ""more"" than both Spain or the Netherlands (in my opinion)."
66877,We have more euros than France!
66879,"Yeah that’s definitely true, and Spain has only reached the semi final only once, let alone final"
66880,Brazil Germany Italy Argentina Uruguay for me.
66881,why uruguay? (im legit asking)
66882,"Two World Cups, 15 Copas América, they are the NT with more official titles, great players in the past and present."
66883,damn when did they win TWO world cups? i some how never knew that
66884,"They won the first world Cup ever in 1930 and in 1950 they made the greatest upset in the history of World Cups known as ""Maracanazo""."
66885,Uruguay should be #5
66886,smh we dont even get a CL spot
66887,Well the better French players play in other leagues much loke germans playing in other leagues
66888,My fucking sides
66889,Wish it was all time national teams compared would love to see that 2002 Brazil team vs 2010 Spain.
66890,"I've already [done that](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6mea8o/the_all_time_greatest_national_squads_as_voted_by/) - the results were Spain 2010, Brazil 1970, Germany 2014, Brazil 2002, and France 1998."
66891,Uruguay behind Netherlands is a bit of a joke.
66892,"The Netherlands' way of playing football is probably one of the most influential of any team ever, and I'd say that them to 3 world cup finals is quite significant, especially considering Uruguay's 2 world cups came at a time when there were only 13 teams in the finals."
66893,Uruguay should be #5 imo.
66895,"If you’re gonna do that, you should also include france’s euros stat as well, just for a fairer comparison."
66896,Uruguay should be a lot higher
66897,uruguay should be 4th or 5th
66898,Uruguay 8th lol
66899,"I'll stick with the [Elo rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings#Highest_average_ratings_since_1970). 4th place, baby."
66900,"That's only from 1970 onwards, not over all of football history."
66901,England's most successful period was *before* 1970. We'd probably be ranked even higher were it to include all of football history.
66902,If you say so...
66903,Uruguay should be higher than Spain. The latter have been incredible for a few years but did nothing much before that.
66904,Netherlands should be higher up
66905,Around what period was the Hungarian National team successful? Also who were their most well known players? I only really know Gabor Kiraly and Zoltan Gera
66906,Ferenc Puskas is pretty famous.
66907,I did know Puskas. Just not great with knowing people’s nationalities.
66908,"Remember that Ferenc is typically Hungarian, it's a very common surname in that country and it doesn't exist elsewhere, this is oftenly a massive hint to guess someone is hungarian"
66909,It's likely he didn't know Puskas' first name. I didn't
66910,You might have read it but you didn't remember because Ferenc doesn't mean anything to you. Now that I have told you I'm pretty sure you will notice it many times
66911,I thought his first name was Puskas and his surname was Award
66912,"From the 30s through to the mid 50s. They were at their best in the 50s with the ""Golden Team"" that laid the groundwork for Total Football, had a 50 match stretch where they lost just once (in the 1954 World Cup Final), and had a series of famous wins over footballing powerhouses. By far their most famous player of the time was Ferenc Puskas, who is one of the all time legends of the game, but he was surrounded by an incredible core of really talented players. I suggest reading up on it, because the rise and fall of that team is a really fascinating topic."
66913,"That´s a way better response than mine.
Anyway here is the wiki for the hungarian [golden team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Team)"
66914,The 50s where they only lost 1 game which was unfortunately the World Cup Final
66915,"> unfortunately

That's up for debate."
66916,Well thry absolutly destroyed you in the groupfase
66917,"Your point being? He's totally right. He's also /u/random_german_guy..

Not that your comment isn't also true"
66918,"Well. The point is that they are arguably a way better side, which would make them deserve to win. Which would make it unfortunate for them to loose.

But on the other hand it is indeed true that they did not show it at the most important moment.
And yeah of course it is true that it is not unfortunite for a german.

Edit: better sentence."
66919,"They were the best team in the world in the late 40s and early 50s.
It was a big surprise back then, when Germany beat them in the final.

[Ferenc Puskas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Pusk%C3%A1s) still is a national hero."
66920,Puskas and Kocsis
66921,England is too high
66922,"not as high as Holland, ayyyy."
66923,1966
66924,"Who should go above them? Uruguay is arguable, but then who?"
66925,"lol at people assuming Uruguay would get into the top 5 of this vote because they won a couple of world cup decades ago, such a clinical way of looking at it."
66926,>The all time top national teams
66927,"yes, **all time**, not from 1900-1950."
66928,"""All time, but not literally 43% of that time"""
66929,So which team do you suggest for their spot?
66930,"* 2 world cups

* 2 olympics, both when it was the equivalent of the world cup

* won 15 copa america titles (more than anyone)

* won the copa america in every decade except the 1970s and 2000s

* got to two other world cup semis

how are they not top 5 at the very least?"
66931,"Uruguay has more World Cups than France, Spain and England"
66932,"yes, I mention the world cups."
66933,"I know, after all we're only the country with most international competitions won."
66934,What have France done to be better than Spain?
66935,Spain wasn't really that good until recently
66936,Same for France...
66937,"Champions in 98, second place in 2006, third place in 86 and 56 and fourth place in in 82.

Spain on the other hand were champions in 10 and got fourth place in 1950."
66938,Spain have won three Euros
66939,Yes and France won two. I'll admit that they aren't far apart in their performances but for me France has just been slightly better in football history.
66940,Didn't Just Fontaine score like a million goals in the 56 world cup?
66941,58
66942,no way he scored that many
66943,Yeah that one
66944,"Better results historically, and if it counts French people have invented and forged the World Cup and the Euro cup"
66945,"If that counts England invented football. 

It doesn't count"
66946,"> Better results historically

World Cup finals stats:

France: 

- 15/21 appearances. 
- 59 matches: 28W, 12D, 19L.
- Best result: 1 x WIN (1998)
- Worst result: 6 x Group Stage (1930, 1954, 1966, 1978, 2002, 2010)

Spain: 

- 15/21 appearances. 
- 59 matches: 29W, 12D, 18L. 
- Best result: 1 x WIN (2010)
- Worst result: 5 x Group Stage (1962, 1966, 1978, 1998, 2014)


It's basically the same tbh. If you count Euros also I'd say is slightly better for Spain."
66947,"Yeah, it's really close and it shows in the poll results anyway, although France was performing better on a decade basis in terms of placement. France is also known for rivalries with Brazil and Italy, meanwhile Spain is still seen for some people as a new giant. 

I don't know why he's making a fuss about 0.5 points difference' anyway, if Spain places higher at the following WC and Euros they'll be ahead easily."
66948,"> I don't know why he's making a fuss about 0.5 points difference' anyway

Me neither, maybe he is too young or hasnt done much research about the eras he couldnt witness."
66949,"In world cups 
France have 1 title, 1 final 3 semi-final 2 quarter final.
Spain have 1 title 1 semi final 4 quarter finals. 
We also have a 3-1-1 record against you in tournaments if we include euros. If we had the same kind of record against Italy or Germany we would have won shit tons of trophies."
66950,"> If we had the same kind of record against Italy or Germany we would have won shit tons of trophies.

And if my grandma had wheels she would be a bike."
66951,"Don't hate on me mate, we have a better team than you, that's all"
66952,"Keep dreaming, pal."
66953,"Neither was particularly successful before 1998 but Spain have won more trophies.

Why does inventing the tournament make them a better team?"
66954,"Not particularly successful ? Lol France got third place in 58, and was excellent during the 80' and Platini generation, with an Euro and a fourth place after the bullshit game against Germany."
66955,Yeah that isn't particularly successful mate
66956,Still better than Spain
66957,"People discussing Spain vs France while two time champions (also of the olympics, before WC era) Uruguay sits behind both of them and a title-less Netherlands. Weird."
66958,But r/soccer said this place was overrun with Americans.
66959,"Arrigo Sacchi's milan team circa 89/90.
Amazing players: Baresi, Maldini, Ancelotti, Rijkaard, Donadoni, Gullit, and Van Basten...
And tactically astute"
66960,"Greatest defense ever, along with the greatest attacking trio ever, although msn arguably changed that.  That team was absolutely unreal"
66961,"In my opinion, one of the greatest indications of that teams greatness is the impact it left on world football afterwards. 

FIFA changed the offside rule partially because of how that Milan defense mastered/abused it. 

Guardiola's pressing game was indirectly derived from Sacchi, even Jurgen Klopp gave Sacchi credit for his gegenpressing.

Look at the top level football managers and executives that were involved in the club directly during or after his influence: Capello, Rijkaard, Ancelotti, Boban, Savicevic, Gullit, etc... Everywhere you look in football today you can see Sacchi's disciples."
66962,[1950s Hungary national team.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Team) Stuff of legend.
66963,"Pep's Barca, because it was fun to watch how they outplayed every team, small teams, big teams, top teams, all of them change their style of play just not to get destroyed 6-0."
66964,"Bayern Munich under Jupp Heynckes (which culminated with the treble in 12/13). Their way of playing football was a joy to watch: fast passing football with the fullbacks attacking non-stop.

I also believe the Milan team under Sacchi and Capello with the Dutch trio, Baresi, a young Maldini etc. deserves a mention. Five Champions League finals in seven years, which they won three of them speaks for itself."
66965,"Pep's Barca, specifically in the 10-11 season."
66966,"Okay, we get it. Leicester is great."
66967,There are literally three comments and none mention Leicester
66968,Total football Ajax!
66970,What's that
66971,Heynckes treble winning team were something else!
66972,They were the best team or they were something else? Can't understand you.
66973,"Sorry, they were the best."
66974,"Sorry, i tried to be funny but i overestimated by humor. Again sorry."
66975,"Ajax 1995. Because of Litmanen, the one and only King of Finland."
66976,AC Milan 1989-1990

In no particular order"

66979,"Pep's Barca, namely the 2010-11 season. Best team I ever watched. MSN is a joy to watch but that Barca was something else man."
66980,Sacchi's Milan
66981,Guardiola's Barcelona 08-11
66983,"I think Pep's Barca were better. If Barcelona can continue their current form for a long time, then they can be the best."
66984,Milan 88-90
66985,I don't think they're better than Pep's Barca.
66986,Certainly more entertaining and more attacking
66987,"True, but that wasn't the question."
66988,Pep's Barca were entertaining too.
66989,I think they would lose against Heynckes Bayern.
66990,Brazil's 1970 World Cup winning squad. Then either Barca 08-09 or Man Utds treble winning side.
66991,Port Vale- 1991/92
66992,"If the single, most important question posed to any player or team is whether they can do what they do best on a cold, rainy night at Stoke, the answer should be quite clear for everyone."
66993,"Guardiola's Barca. I think that team played the most beautiful passing football, and just dominated every team in its path. They beat madrid 6-2, 5-0 and completely dominated man utd in ucl final."
66994,"Little busy right now, will answer later."
66996,Can't decide between Pep's Barca and Enrique's Barca.
66997,And The Dream Team as well
66998,"When I think of the best *team* ever, i don't think it means adding up all the amazing players. I think of it as the best group of players that really work together and have amazing chemistry. For example, Real Madrid nowadays isn't a great team, just a collection of great players. 
The best team I have ever seen was Atlético Madrid 2013-2014. The entire squad had the same philosophy and played their roles so well. Simeone's 4-4-2 that didn't emphasize possession but rather maximize chances was perfectly geared against top tier clubs, and the playing styles were easily adjusted game-to-game. Diego Costa scored when he wanted because he harrassed the opposition's back line, Gabi, Koke, and the midfield cut off passing lanes without overcommiting, Godin and Miranda shut down world class forwards, Juanfran and Felipe Luis were threatening on attack and solid in defense. To top it all off, Courtois was a top 3 keeper that year, and saved our asses many times. Winning the league over the giants Barca and Real was incredible, and coming sooooooooo close to winning the Champions League was miraculous given the lack of (at that time) star players and financial resources. Atlético was successful that season because they were the best team in the world."
66999,Now i'm not one to shut a man down but tbh this was the stupidest answer i've ever heard. Threads about the greatest team ever; Atlético weren't even the greatest team in their city in 2013/14. #halamadrid
67000,"We're both biased I guess..... But admit it, Atleti were less than a minute away from beating Real ..."
67001,Impossible to say. Massive difference between club and international and too much variation between eras
67002,Has to be current Barca I mean the match against Bayern last season... they made Top top class team look like midfield team
67003,Guardiola's Barca did the same as well
67004,"What exactly is a ""midfield team""....?"
67005,I assume he means mid-table aka average.
67006,"Christ. I know what he meant, just the way he phrased it was odd...."
67007,The current USMNT. Obviously Clint Dempsey. Duh
67008,"You listed off mostly tandem-focused drop zones. There's lots of those in California. Drop zones worth going to between LA and SF are Taft (great fun jumping scene), santa Barbara (less fun jumpers, but a fun dz nonetheless), skydance and skydive California - These two are the top drop zones in northern california. Byron Bay is also a good dz. Have fun! Cheers"
67009,I spent 3 days at Skydance a couple years ago when i was a noob with 50 jumps. Everyone there was super supportive and helped me out a bunch. You should definitely check them out.
67010,Skydive California has my vote. Amazing people both staff and fun jumpers.
67011,"I live in the Bay and went to school in socal so I've been to a lot of different dropzones.  The best dz in the norcal are Skydance, Skydive California, and Skydive Bay Area (Byron).  Stick with those dzs and you'll have a great time!  Also, avoid hollister. 

For dz in socal, Skydive Santa Barbara and Taft are great.  Also, if you're willing to drive a bit away from LA, I would definitely recommend Perris and Elsinore."
67012,Sky dive Monterey was amazing. Great views along the coast.
67013,"Definitely schedule some time for Skydive California in Tracy! Great place for all skill levels and the DZO and staff are the best people. Great facilities and nice big landing area. Skydance and Byron also have busy fun jumper scenes. If you have time, check all of them out. Byron (Skydive NorCal) and Tracy aren't too far apart from one another either."
67014,"Hollister, I think, is the only non-tandem factory in the bunch.

Your options are Skydance, Taft, and Hollister."
67015,"For future info... Boogies are not great places to go to stay current or get current. You have a drop zone that is much busier and with larger planes and more people in the air than normal.   

It is also the WORST place to demo new gear - More people in the air, more stuff going on, more people who are not used to the DZ.  

Some people will claim I am wrong.... But they will be unable to explain why a boogie is a SAFER place than a normal DZ weekend. They will instead try to claim, ""It is not that big of a deal""...."
67017,">  It's not like they're dropping multiple otter loads at once. You're still just dealing with one load of people at a time.

There are many boogies that do EXACTLY that. Plus a helicopter, etc. And you put a Twin Otter at a DZ that normally has a 182 and there is a BIG difference. Or at a place like Zhills that will be flying two Otters and will have them dropping while the other load is landing. 

Like I said... People are going to disagree, but the only defense will be ""It is not that bad"".... I disagree."
67018,"I agree, boogies are better suited for those current and on their toes. I went to a boogie earlier in the year. I was doing a 4-way wingsuit flight and I was confused to find a few belly jumpers falling past us, especially knowing that we were the last people out of the plane. Turns out they were from the next load that left after my load took off. My load did a go-around and I guess the next load behind us did not get the message...."
67019,"Had same shit happen recently. Not with me, but with a full load of CRW that hopped out before us. We had to do a go-around for traffic. After everyone landed, CRW leader told me that they saw bunch of meat bombs flying past them. Second plane caught up... ugh."
67020,That happens on non boogies at bigger DZs.  I've had times where I just finished my wingsuit flight to see other people opening up pretty close.  It's fun to watch from 2k but a little freaky too since all of a sudden you have all this extra traffic.  It's quite common though depending on spacing to have one load just landing while the other is dropping at big dzs especially if 3 planes are going.
67022,"> Have you ever been to a Boogie? 

I was an organizer for the WFFC in 1996 and 1997. I lived on the DZ in ZHills for about 5-6 years and participated in every boogie, to include just being at the Turkey Meet last Nov. I have been an organizer at 6 different DZ's over the last 25 years. 

You ever been to the WFFC? You ever organized at a boogie? You have an AFFI rating?

>  What dz is dropping formation loads with jumpers who don't know they are on a formation load?   

Never said 'formation load'. I sad that at many boogies the pilots are talking and will start jump run and drop jumpers while the last load is landing. You never been to a boogie when a group is landing and another is on jump run? Maybe you have not been to a real boogie?"
67024,">  HAHAHAHA! Oh my god, buddy. Did you seriously just try to turn this into a dick measuring contest?   

YOU did when you asked ""Have you ever been to a Boogie?"" 
I see you DIDN'T answer the questions. I answered yours. Kinda rude.   

>  Answer without the skygod self-jerk. It's weird and cringy. 

You tried to make it a dick measuring contest by asking ""If I had ever been to a boogie?"" 

Like I said, people will disagree, but they will be unable to say why it is safe and instead just claim it is not a big deal... The EXACT thing you did. 

I will wait to see if you ever answer that you have been an LO or have an AFF rating. You won't. Like I said, the best argument you can do is claim it is not that bad - QED.   

The irony of you claiming I made it a contest when your started making accusations first.... I just answered your question. You gonna answer mine?

And yeah, I'll put my skydiving resume up against your any day.... Wanna play? Or you just going to continue to try childish insults and distractions?  

>  Why, then, at summerfest do they have LO's who are dedicated to newer jumpers?   

Because they know low timers will show up. Even if it is a bad idea. It is a better idea to have someone watch over them than let them just run around without a clue and without organization."
67026,">  80% of your response is pure attempt at dick measuring and argument via authority.  

There was nothing till YOU started trying to measure dicks. Look in the mirror before you accuse me.  
  
>  My question about the boogie was clearly rhetorical.   

No, you were trying to make yourself seem like an expert. I answered your silly question, you can't defend against it and so you changed your argument. You said: "" I've been to many boogies.....Have you ever been to a Boogie?""

>  because you're not listening.   

Irony score off the chart here. I said boogies are not good paces to go to get or stay current: ""Boogies are not great places to go to stay current or get current."" You took umbrage with that and argued some other point. 

>  Now you're latching into my rhetorical question about going to boogies because your ego is fragile or something. Relax. You're a skygod. We all get it. You're a big deal. That doesn't mean you're right, automatically, though. A boogie isn't as bad as you're pretending it is, and your reasonings are invalid.  

And now you devolve into personal attacks.... Till you answer the questions... You are not worth trying to have a discussion.. All you have brought so far is your failed attempt to paint me as a novice who has not been to a boogie, then some personal attacks."
67028,[Skydive Santa Barbara](https://www.skydivesantabarbara.com/) is where I went.  It was an amazing experience.
67029,Sweet thanks!
67030,GoJump Oceanside is pretty great.  There might be one just as good closer to LA though.
67031,"Tandem, I'm assuming?

San Diego has some spots. I think Lake Elsinore is where I went a few years ago."
67032,Yeah I don't know the process to get certified to do it on your own!
67033,One of the best drop zones with views of the pacific and mountains best is near Santa Barbara. Worth the drive.
67034,"Sweet, what is the place called?"
67035,Sky Dive Santa Barbara
67036,Perris is where a lot of pro teams train out of and the clubhouse has cheap (and good) eats and drinks. Also they have a nice pool to take a few laps. Great for a family day.
67038,"Oh cool, how much is that to do?"
67039,"2 flights for $60, or something like that"
67040,Cool!
67041,I 100% recommend Skydive CA. Community is great and they're also safety-minded.
67042,I also recommend Skydive ca
67043,"I, too, endorse Skydive California. There's a shuttle that runs from SF."
67044,"I, also, recommend Skydive California! It's a fantastic DZ."
67045,AMANDA IS THIS YOU?
67046,"Lodi-Cheap. Monterey-Best views. Skydive Norcal-2nd best views, and you can make a day out of it wine tasting if you want. Skydive California (Tracy)-friendliest, imo. Hard to go wrong with any in the Bay really"
67047,"The nice thing about the Bay Area is that it has \*tons\* of great dropzones. Byron, Hollister, Skydive California, and SkyDance all are great places. Skydive CA in Tracy is the new one on the block, and it's where I've jumped most lately and it's great. Basically as long as you avoid Lodi they're all pretty great. (Hollister sometimes has a mixed reputation, but ignore the haters.)

Honestly, you're not going to remember much of freefall so optimizing for ""views"" is kind of silly. It'll all be beautiful in the air. I've never jumped at (or even really heard of) Skydive Golden Gate, but I'm sure they're fine too."
67048,I jumped at Lodi and I survived 🤷🏼‍♂️
67049,"Yeah everyone knows if you go to Lodi, Bill will literally give you cancer and AIDS, and then will proceed to force you to watch as he murders a baby kitten right before your very eyes."
67050,Is skydiving really where you want to pinch pennies?
67051,"It’s not money that saves your life, it’s a parachute."
67052,My recommendation is DO NOT go to the Lodi one. It's generally the cheapest but their safety record is terrible.
67053,I believe this video is from the Lodi place: https://youtu.be/gQrDIp48lQM
67055,Their safety record isn't bad per se...they are one of the highest volume sky diving facilities in the country. The sport is inherently dangerous (See Minden/Tahoe tandem death just a couple days ago) but their accidents per # of skydivers is no worse than the national average.
67056,"Definitely do Skydive Hollister.


I did my first jump with them and they were amazing. The coaches have tons of experience and are more than willing to answer any questions on the ground and in the air.

I will say it was a while ago but I remember it being pretty reasonable compared to the other skydiving places in the area.

Also photos are so expensive because it requires a second jumper to take the photos"
67057,Thanks I'll check it out. We were more inclined towards Monterey one because of the view.
67058,I went Hollister as well. Highly recommend! The views are incredible...I never really realized how much time you spend under the parachute but it's several minutes and I think it's worth it go somewhere with a great view.
67059,Do Monterey if you haven't booked yet. It's way more intimate (smaller plane) and you get a beautiful view of the ocean.
67060,"I did my first jump out of Taft, CA in the Central Valley.  

This isn't for everyone, but consider taking the additional ground course and jump solo.

While I've not jumped tandem with anyone, being in full control of my gear and landing made the experience very memorable.

During my descent, there were 2 guys falling with me to handle any sort of ""freak out"" I may have had.  Also, one additional camera man taking video.  I felt pretty well covered in the event that I froze and didn't pull my cord.  

Good luck, and DO opt for the pics / video.  The money will seem trivial later when you don't have those memories documented.  : )"
67061,"Thanks, even I wanted to do this but always wondered, what if I drift too far after pulling my cords! Will they teach us to control our descent?"
67062,"Absolutely they will.  I was put into a practice harness where I was able to see how hard I could pull the control cords and how to untangle possible chute line crosses.  

They would drill me on how to do certain things and I'd have to respond as quickly as I could.

They taught me a bunch of hand signals where they could easily communicate with me if I needed to extend my legs more or less, alter any part of my body during descent.

Also, I had a radio in my ear where they could tell me what to do should I start doing something dumb.  lol"
67063,"Not on your list, but my personal favorite DZ in our area is Skydance in Davis. Monterey is gorgeous as well, so my vote goes to that one if you are limited to those three."
67064,"I took my brother for his 21st birthday to Skydiving Monterey. I cant speak for other places, but I think you're gonna get the best view up there. I was awestruck.

You see the ocean, the mountains, and everything inbetweek. It's fucking glorious.

Wherever you go, have fun! It's a killer experience!"
67065,"http://skydivesac.com/

these folks have tons of experience, and the view is spectacular. there are good deals on groupon, too, which makes them a bargain in comparison to some of the other locations around the bay area.

skydive sacramento has a good deal for a tandem skydive from 13,000 feet. the highest allowable dive is 18,000 feet, after which you would need a self-contained breathing apparatus. skydiving out of Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay provide for the best scenery due to the oceanic views, but they are the most expensive and they tend to be from lower drop zones from 8,000 feet.

as a good measuring stick, at least on groupon, it is about $100-$150 from 8,000 feet.

I hope this helps!


edit: NOT AN AD... speaking from personal experience.


also, tipping is customary. they only made sure you survived."
67066,"Anywhere but Lodi, really. Skydance in Davis is great, and they have big planes. Byron is nice, heard that Monterey is nice too.

And DON'T jump at Lodi."
67067,Byron is not nice. I'm amazed their airplane even flew. Being in that piece of junk was way scarier than jumping. Plus it's a thousand degrees with wind turbines all over.
67068,Guess I'm used to jump planes being held together with duct tape and chewing gum. Safer to land under my Sabre 2 than in the plane...
67069,"> Being in that piece of junk was way scarier than jumping.

That's just bonus motivation."
67070,I have a friend who goes to skydive California in Tracy almost every weekend. Always hear good things about that place.
67071,We did the monterey one and it was awesome.
67072,You'll have so much fun! I'd totally do it again.
67073,The best sky diving is likely to be several thousand feet *above* the Bay Area.
67074,"Thanks man, I needed to know that piece of info."
67075,I jumped at Oceanside in 2013. Once of the most beautiful DZ's I have ever jumped at. So for a tandem I'd say go for it. Try to get close to sunset.
67076,Dang I didn't even think about sunset. The only available times were 11:00am or 1:00pm. Think I should wait out another day until I can get a sunset?
