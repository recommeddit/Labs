30984,I agree with you. Feel free to share your knowledge on your ideal countries to settle down
30985,"I don't have knowledge of ideal countries. I was born in the US and will definitely live and retire in the US as I have been able to form real relationships all over the country and I have good quality of life here.

If you really do not like the US then perhaps take a sabbatical to a few countries which interest you."
30986,">(to start a family, to build strong relationships, to own real estate)

Most likely the country you are from."
30988,"This. I have lived in the UK where I was born/grew up, then Sweden (5 years), UK (6 years), USA (17 years), and am now retired back in the UK. It has been a fascinating ride, though every move has had tax implications, residency issues and consequences.

Also, beware vacation goggles. Visiting for a week-long vacation leaves a very different perspective to actually *living* somewhere."
30989,Wow would you like to write about your experience?
30990,Write? for whom?
30991,For redditors who are curious about your personal experience and comparison of those countries
30992,"> they bit off more than they can chew

How?"
30993,The one where your family or your partner’s family (ideally both) are located.
30994,"Well, let's start with the obvious: the US. It's huge and there's a place for every culture, political belief, and lifestyle that you're interested in. 

You don't have to live in a HCOL place either. We live in a 3000sqft on acreage 20 minutes from a major city with an international airport and paid <150k for our house two years ago."
30995,"Terrible health care system, though. That's the biggest downside of the U.S. in my opinion. Most of the population is one accident from disaster."
30996,"> Most of the population is one accident from disaster.

Some, but certainly not most.  The uninsured rate is about 10.9% of the population.   Accidents e.g. auto accidents aren't really a health care system issue but mainly auto insurance."
30997,"[Only 39% of Americans have enough money to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/few-americans-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-1000-emergency.html) Insurance or not, you don't get out of a medical emergency without rapidly eating up your deductible. And that's to say nothing of lost wages, etc.

So yes, I'd say most of the population is one accident from disaster."
30998,"That's absolutely a downside. I feel like a lot of other countries I've looked into have disadvantages too though, whether it's availability of solid investments, security, stability of government, availability of quality food, etc. 

As far as healthcare goes, if you pay for a qualify insurance policy, you're going to get good care. There are other countries where the care is free but may not be good. 

I also think the US socializing medicine is only a matter of time (basically once the boomers die off), so it also depends on what your time horizons are for retirement."
30999,">basically once the boomers die off

The hipsters in Starbucks sure will pay for your healthcare."
31001,Midwest
31002,"The US?  It's in the Northern and Western hemispheres, smack dab in the middle of the North American continent.  You can't miss it.  If you hit Canada you've gone too far and need to circle back."
31003,Where would we be without you?
31004,"Why is the US the obvious? What about Europe? There you can have your fill of 5 thousand years of culture and history, a range of authentic cuisines, and with Nordic to Alpine to Mediterranean climates to choose from - oh, and get this ... universal healthcare with a higher life expectancy than the USA. Wherever you might choose, you would be within a day's drive of 6 or 7 different countries, cultures, histories, language and cuisine to explore.

I love the USA, but it is not the obvious IMO."
31005,Only because 90% of reddit users are currently living in the US.
31006,"> Well, let's start with the obvious: the US. 

I used to think that but I am not sure anymore. I've observed that because of the diversity or something else, people are more reserved and untrusting, comparing to other countries. And they form groups too much, too often, and sometimes too extreme. Also I spot a lack of humanity in the US comparing to a country like UK. It seems people are more materialistic and selfish and more easily influenced by the media and companies in the US."
31007,If you live here you're probably suffering from skeptical bias. I've lived in both the UK and the US and there's no major cultural difference when it comes to how easy it is to break into social groups. In fact in the UK things are even more stratified by class and tradition. Materialism in the UK is the same as well.
31008,"I too have lived in both. There are many similarities, but if I had to call a difference, Americans are peaches, and Brits are melons. What the fuck does that mean, you ask? OK here are two HUGE generalisations, based on 17 years in the US as an expat.

On first meeting, Americans are super friendly and charming. But you very often never get any deeper than that. "" You will have to come over sometime"" they say, and you know you never will. They are soft on the outside and have a hard centre.

On first meeting, Brits are stand-offish, shy even, almost to the point of rudeness. If you get past that tough leathery skin, there is a soft centre of friendship.

No offence meant either way. YMMV.

&#x200B;"
31009,"I lived in both but I might be biased, not sure. That's one of the reasons I posted the question, to hear from others.

> I've lived in both the UK and the US and there's no major cultural difference when it comes to how easy it is to break into social groups. 

How about when it comes to deeper and closer relationships, trust, loyalty?

It seems the culture in Europe makes people more trustworthy and enables you to have closer deeper relationships, comparing to US, on average. Would you disagree?

Edit. Here is an article explaining some differences: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/looking-in-the-cultural-mirror/201009/are-american-friendships-superficial"
31010,"They have 300 million people. If you can't find a group, it's you."
31011,"> Would you disagree?

Yes. But then I'm a US citizen. I found it very difficult to break into British and European social groups simply because of my 'otherness'. But I have made good friends in both places."
31012,"I understand. Would you trust your American friends more than British ones? I'm not sure how long you lived in UK, but I'm generally curious. I also added a link to my other comment to elaborate what I mean by closer relationships."
31013,"Yes? I'm not sure why you keep banging on about trust. Trust, in my experience, is a function of individuals and what you've been through with that individual, not of cultures."
31014,"Then the UK then... I mean, it sounds like you have travelled and have your own opinions, so you tell us? Your ""openminded conservative"" self-description is not helpful in the slightest."
31015,I suspect it's code for libertarian western chauvinist.
31016,"You make sweeping generalizations about Americans but then complain that America is too diverse. Which is it, are we all the same or are we too different?

Why do you think diversity is a bad thing?"
31017,"Sorry to hurt your feelings. You know there are people out there in the world, who different than you, which makes you better or worse than them in various categories and contexts on a purely statistical average, so there is no need to be that offended or resentful. I'm also obviously only speaking from my experience and I'm here to ask other people's experience in case not obvious. So go fight someone else."
31018,I'd like to suggest that perhaps the lack of trust you experience is coming from within. This might ultimately be the source of your inability to make lasting friendships.
31019,Oh thanks for your genuine concern. I have a few lifelong friends but in different countries.
31020,"Depends on your culture. Your going to have an easier time making friends if you fit in with the general culture, religion, education. If you go somewhere where there is a big difference in any of those things it can get lonely very quickly. Also think about proximity to family when having kids."
31021,"Did you know there is a [world happiness report](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/)? It ranks countries for happiness of people within the country, and for people who move to the country. If you are thinking of migrating, the second one might be of interest. 


From [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report)
The top ten scores in 2018 are as follows:

1	 Finland

2	 Norway	

3	 Denmark

4	 Iceland

5	  Switzerland	

6	 Netherlands

7	 Canada

8	 New Zealand	

9	 Sweden

10	 Australia

31022,"Anyone who has actually traveled to those countries knows that Scandinavians are not actually happier than Africans. They may have more of the stuff, health care, life expectancy, etc., that we think makes people happier, but they're not actually happier."
31023,"**World Happiness Report**

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network which contains rankings of national happiness and analysis of the data from various perspectives. The World Happiness Report is edited by John F. Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs. The 2017 edition added three associate editors; Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Haifang Huang, and Shun Wang.

31027,"Spain is FIRE friendly.  Your biggest issue is going to be the immigration/VISA issue. Find a list of countries where you can be an expat and then ask your question about those countries. For example, New Zealand is great, but you either need to be a citizen, have a specific skill and want to work, or have many millions to buy your way in."
31028,"> Spain is FIRE friendly. 

How about in terms of raising family? 

> New Zealand is great 

In what ways?"
31029,"The Spanish are VERY family friendly, as are the Italians. There are some immigration perks for Spain and they are encouraging to immigration and property ownership if you have resources. It's also affordable. 
NZ is beautiful and has so much different terrain. Low crime, friendly, eco friendly, clean air, don't see much poverty. Doesn't matter though, you'll never get a visa. Maybe that's why it's great, they're very discriminating with who they let in."
31030,"AFAIK even hookers are considered skilled workers in NZ and can get visas. Why do you say you’ll never get visa? 

Spain seems quiet nice. What kind of immigration perks? Is Spain more patriarchal than NZ?"
31031,Not sure where you get your information but only NZ citizens or residents can legally work as sex workers. It cannot be used as a basis for gaining a visa.
31032,https://www.rt.com/news/425129-new-zealand-prostitutes-jobs-immigrants/amp/
31034,Thanks for the clarification
31035,I saw someone recommend this website - [https://www.theearthawaits.com/](https://www.theearthawaits.com/)  I think it will help you out.
31036,"The country you are from?

I am from the Philippines and planning to FIRE there because
A. My family is there
B. Lower cost of living, so my savings will go a looong way
C. I already got real estates there"
31037,Houston
31038,Close to family.
31039,Singapore should fit your bill.
31040,"I’m biased (like everyone) but I’d say Australia and NZ are very high up on the list. The only unfortunate downside is the cost of real estate - which is unsurprising given the number of people that want to live here. 

Safe, excellent healthcare, excellent education systems, fair legal system, great opportunities and stable western political systems. Hard to get into if you can’t meet the skilled migration requirements, though."
31041,Switzerland and Estonia.
31042,Any comments of Estonia’s future safety? It’s a small county and easy to invade
31043,"> and easy to invade

and many have succeeded. Part of the beauty really, because food architecture women are best of breed German Danish Swedish and Russian."
31044,You want to raise your kids and grandkids and grow old in an easy to invade country?
31045,"Any of the Nordic countries really. Northern Sweden, Norway and Finland may be too cold for you, but the southern parts and Denmark have mild, 4-season weather. In 2018, 26 of July's 31 days went above 25 degrees C (79 degrees F)  in Denmark.

If cycling is your thing I would seriously consider Denmark. More than 12,000 kms of bike  paths. 26% of all trips less than 5 kms are made on bikes.

37 hr work week.

Progressive country, social democratic government newly elected with plans to heavily turn up  environmental policies, and limit previous restrictions on skilled immigration.

Universal healthcare.

Unemployment about 5%, GDP per capita about 56k USD according to Eurostat. The economy is currently experiencing a ""balanced upswing"" for the 6th year in a row, accrding to the Danish central bank (March 2019)."
31046,I have been to Southern Denmark and believe me it's breath taking beautiful.
31047,Denmark Sounds Awesome !! what kind of fish can you catch from shore ??
31048,"It could be worse, for sure :).

Ha, I admit I'm not an expert on this, but my dad used to take me along on some of his fishing trips along the coast and streams in Denmark. Along the coast I know you can catch sea trout, Atlantic cod, garfish, herring, coalfish and I think mackarel as well.

In the freshwater streams, you can catch perch, river trout and sturgeon (and a bunch of others, but these two I'm pretty sure of)."
31049,"H-sina ,  is Denmark the warmest of the scandinavian countries? , so everyone has a bicycle , but what if it snows🤔do they put salt on bike trails? i lived in cold Vermont when married, but now i love living by coconut trees in key west... & thanx for fishN info"
31050,"It depends a little bit if you're asking about warmest temperature in general, or warmest average temperature. For average values then yes - the oceanic flow keep the winters mild in Denmark, but also prevent extremely hot summers. Due to its more inland location however, the summers in the interior regions of Finland can get significantly hotter than the rest of Scandinavia (30+ from what I've read). On the flipside, the winters are also way harsher than in the coastal areas. 

And yes, the bike paths get salted and cleared of snow when needed. They are generally well-maintained... The Road Directorate runs a machine over it regularly, which uses laser to identify unevenness in the surface due to root damage or potholes (I'm not an engineer though, so I don't know too much of the technical details... I just thought it was cool that they used laser to identify bike path potholes heh).

Also, Key West is awesome! I fell in love with the quirky atmosphere when I visited a few years back. Someone told me that the Keys declared independence when someone tried to make them pay for use of the bridge. I have no idea if the story is true, but it perfectly captures the mood of the place to me :)."
31051,How can one get to Denmark?
31052,"Plane, boat, bus or car"
31053,They will return that once you get there. How do you stay there permanently?
31054,Find a high paid job or get married to a Dane.
31055,Is it possible to find a job from the states ?
31056,"It is possible, but not easy. Depends on your qualifications too."
31057,"I agree, this does seem possible."
31058,Masters degree plus project management?
31059,But the weather there is pretty extreme in winter
31060,"Not really, though it depends what you mean by extreme? Temperature-wise, it's very mild - average temperature is 2 degrees celcius (36 degrees F) in December. 
The hardest thing can be the short days in winter - the shortest has 7 hours between sunrise and sunset, while the longest in the summer has about 18."
31062,"It’s pretty easy, massive number of expats here. It is not the most progressive (gay adoption, paternity leave, etc). You may still feel some of the gender inequality, e.g. official letters which state “in the presence of your husband”. The weather is relatively moderate, but the winters are very gray in many of the cities. Work weeks of 40-45, one thing I really like about Switzerland is that it is very common to work less than 100%. Many colleagues with kids will work 60-80%. 

Good cycling and hiking. Plenty of tech jobs. The cities are incredibly clean, and living is very comfortable. The summers are great, the winters I find very oppressive. 

This is from my experience in the German speaking region."
31063,Switzerland is one of the hardest European countries to emigrate to if you don't have EU/EEA citizenship.
31064,"If you are a skilled tech person, or in one of the other in demand industries like pharmacy, then it isn’t as bad."
31065,"This is interesting coming from me, a yank. All my friends always speak highly of Switzerland. It’s surprising to hear it’s not as progressive as I thought."
31066,It’s a weird mix of very progressive on some issues and not so much on others.
31067,"It is very mixed to be honest. The urban areas are indeed very progressive, especially the youth (I‘m a student in Bern). I‘m not sure about the workplace equality, as all I did was small jobs and I‘m male, so I would not really be on the recieving end of inequality.
As probably in most developed countries it really depends on where you go and with what ageclass of people you interact. The old generations and the rural population are still very religious, conservative and to the extend I experienced it somewhat racist, but the youth is the complete opposite (and with youth I mean up to 30-35 even).
Im not at all patriotic or somehow proud of „my“ country, but overall it‘s the best imaginable place to live in. Especially for the outdoors (woods and mountains) and for traveling. Drive 3-5 hours in one direction and you are already in the next country."
31068,Indeed. Same experience in US. Older generations standards certainly clash with the progressive youth. And yes I have heard plenty of the outdoors expectations over there.
31069,"Maybe those expectations have been built up a little too much with reddit alone. The pictures you see on r/pics from switzerlane are insane. But chances are, there is a busstop really close to it because everything is so well connected. ^^

But I just recently realised that the place where i live (5 min from a big sea, around it a snowy mountain range, and it‘s still more than warm enough to bathe in summer) is actually a lot of peoples dream place to live."
31070,Fails on gender equality. Scandinavia wins out
31071,"Scandinavia is less gender equal when it comes to things like choice of profession compared to other similar countries. This is usually referred to as the Nordic equality paradox. Turns out that when you make it easier for both genders to choose whatever career path they like, the difference in the actual choices increase, not decrease. Policies that increase oppurtunity tends to make outcomes less equal."
31072,So Scandinavia is more gender equal..
31074,"I mean more gender equality of oppurtunity, and less gender equality of outcome, simultaneously."
31075,"That gets thrown around a lot, but it's very hard to isolate any single cause to those patterns, so it may just be that it's not about increased freedom at all. The Scandinavian countries aren't without their own sets of norms and values either."
31076,Relatively speaking I guess. Really all of Europe works for this guy's purposes.
31077,I thought about it too
31078,Vancouver checks off practically everything you listed there
31079,"Even the weather? I’ve never been to Vancouver, but I never want to experience a Montreal winter again!"
31080,"Vancouver is probably one of the cities with the mildest weather in all of Canada. Take it from me who's from a country that basically has two seasons, 40C summers and 30C rainy winters, lived there for two months and adapted pretty quickly. The coldest it got when I was there was -5C."
31081,"I currently in Vancouver and grew up in Ottawa, can confirm that Vancouver climate is very mild. It might be the only place in Canada where it doesn't constantly snow and doesn't have -30 winters. It might snow 5-10 days in the winter, it might get as low as -10, but that's nothing compared to the rest of Canada. There's just a lot of rain. 

Can also confirm that Vancouver checks off all the boxes that OP mentioned, it's a beautiful place but cost of living and especially real estate is very high."
31082,"Yeah like what the other said - winter is laughable to the rest of Canada, virtually non existent with average of 0c to -5c, hardly snows. Summer is typically 23-28c. This is one of the reason why Vancouver is consistently ranked in top 5 of the best livable city in the world."
31083,"Most of Western and some Central Europe, probably Canada (short of “mild weather”),  Australia and NZ too. What languages do you speak?"
31084,He's fluent in English and Russian. I'm fluent in English and working on French.
31085,Maybe not the weather but a lot of places in Scotland.
31086,Depends what OP means by warm. If they are ok with 60-70 F summers then it could work.
31087,Tbf in the last few years it has been getting substantially warmer.
31088,It's 7 pm in Texas right now and it's 95 F. People think 70+ is warm?
31089,"Yeah, my ideal would probably be 70-80 degree days year round, including at night. Not sure that exists though, so decided I should be a bit more flexible :P"
31090,"If you find Avalon, please let me know."
31091,Malaga gets hotter than that but LORD is the lifestyle amazing.
31092,"Yo wtf 70 is perfect

I live in Texas too and it’s always 90+ my ducking god the plains"
31093,Fr I work a corporate job and my boobs get so sweaty on the ride home lmao. It's fucking hot here
31094,"If my A/C is on 70, I am wearing a sweater and socks. Who wants to wear socks in the summer?

I would not accept a summer that didn’t hit 80° regularly to be “warm.” Above 90° would be a “hot” summer."
31095,"70 and humid and in the sun is nice though. The problem with air conditioning is you're indoors and it's usually dry, which makes it feel cooler."
31096,"Very true. But if it drops below 70 at night, I always bring a sweater. I’m glad to be out of the northeast now, where I don’t have to carry a sweater with me year round, “just in case the sun goes down”"
31097,"You have air conditioning though so I think you are forgetting that. I moved to Scotland from the Midwest (lived in Kansas and Texas). I thought this as well but what you don’t realise is that high 70s and low 80s are brutal when you have zero air conditioning and we’ve had a ton of that weather this year. 

If you don’t believe me go a week in spring when it’s high 70s low to mid 80s in Texas without turning anything on - no a/c, not even the fan. Then come back and tell me that’s nice weather. Lol.

Edit: oh and make sure that week is full of rain but still warm. Because that’s the weather here. Very high humidity because we all live close to the coast and it rains constantly. If you are from Houston then you’ll understand spring blows without ac."
31098,Yep that sounds like a nightmare. :(
31099,"It’s about perspective I guess. For me, living anywhere it gets 70+ for most of the day is unthinkable. I grew up in NYC and while it’s not known for being extremely hot in the summer, the humidity combined with 80+ temperatures killed me."
31100,I grew up in central Florida. I remember anything above 80 being brutal but not 70+ :s
31101,What sort of tech/social science? I would suggest New Zealand but the type of job could be limiting...
31102,"> What sort of tech/social science

My boyfriend is a programmer. I have worked for NGOs, but pursuing a Masters in International Affairs and might switch to studying UX or something like that if my career options seem too limited."
31103,"International affairs is kinda known as the ironic killer of dreams for moving abroad, so realistically you will need to change unless you're moving by proxy from your boyfriend's career.

I would also bear in mind that pretty much every country pays programmers significantly less than the US so if this is where you're coming from you might find that together you are worse off even considering the guaranteed healthcare etc."
31104,"> International affairs is kinda known as the ironic killer of dreams for moving abroad

I'd be curious to know more about what you mean by this. I mean I've definitely been worried about outcomes but I'd be curious to hear more about what you actually know, if that makes sense? From what I've read really the only careers guaranteed to be workable abroad are in tech, medicine, or sometimes the trades, and it's hard to get a feel if International Affairs is significantly worse than other possibilities outside of that or not.

Regarding pay, I think some countries (Switzerland and Australia, for example) pay around what the U.S. pays. However, in the U.S. everyone works more than 40 hours a week and vacation isn't guaranteed. I'm tired of making money without being able to really spend it on lots of travel and leisure time, if that makes sense?"
31105,"Medicine is an interesting choice; there are some countries with similar qualification and training, but moving abroad means getting tested/certified by the local governing body - lots of paper-work, and in the worst case you have to restart your training from scratch.

&#x200B;

(My wife is a doctor, she moved from Finland to Scotland, and there was a fair bit of paperwork involved getting registered & permission to work in A&E from the GMC.)"
31106,"You can definitely find companies in the US that have a great work/life balance and offer plenty of vacation. Especially in the tech field. I work for a software company (as a techie) and have 6 weeks of vacation (30 days) and work 40 hours a week other than rare occasions. Seattle meets most of your requirements except for healthcare (though again, the right company will have good benefits there too)."
31107,"My boyfriend works for a tech company. He has 5 weeks of vacation per year, but he probably works more like 45-50 hours a week, and works less than many other techies we know. I always have less vacation than him, and we both have a significant commute. And even where he works, taking more than 2 weeks off at a time is sort of frowned upon, which is also very common in the U.S."
31108,"Taking more than 2 weeks off in a row is pretty rare regardless...your vacation days are meant to last throughout the year. Some randoms backpacking around wherever for a month is a thing but still rare

Just because people you know work 50+ doesn't mean all companies do. He can search for feedback on companies known for good wlb

what was your bachelors in? UX is gonna be much more useful than international affairs"
31109,"My bachelors was in social sciences also. I'd need to pick up an entirely different degree (maybe a 1-year Masters) to do UX, and starting from scratch on experience there. I'm actually on a job roster for the UN right now where it's estimated about 90% of us will be offered jobs, btw, so the International Affairs degree would not necessarily be totally worthless. But it probably wouldn't offer as much flexibility as I'd ideally like to have."
31111,"Wellington or Auckland could work. Wellington has recently being doing a big push for immigrants to come work in tech. I have friends in UX and programming that have done well. 

NGO work may be a bit harder, but with that experience and Masters a job in Government could be a good option. We allow foreigners to work in govt, its only higher security clearances that could be an issue."
31112,"\>  We allow foreigners to work in govt, its only higher security clearances that could be an issue. 

So the situation is different in New Zealand compared to Australia then? I read on the Australian subs that in Australia, it is nearly impossible to get a job in the government even in the post office without a permanent residency."
31113,"I worked in the government in New Zealand on working holiday, not even a proper working visa. It was only an admin job, but it was still in the government, and I know folks with more policy-type backgrounds doing more policy-type things on WHV as well."
31114,"I'd love to talk with you more about this. I've thought about applying to the WHV in New Zealand to check it out temporarily, and I'd love to do something policy related. Mind if I DM some questions?"
31115,"For sure! I loved doing the WHV in NZ and I’d highly recommend it, happy to answer any questions I can."
31116,"The NZ economy is so very small.  It is less than one 10th the size of say the Australian economy.  Every year approximately 30,000 New Zealanders who were born in NZ leave NZ to try and have a better life in Australia.  Whenever I see NZ mentioned in these threads, I assume the person recommending it doesn’t really understand the very limited opportunities there.  People whose whole families live there and who have lived there their whole lives can’t see a prosperous future there."
31117,"Idk, I’m a kiwi and I left for a while but it’s not because I couldn’t see a prosperous future here. I left because I wanted to experience the rest of the world! And I’m in a very limited job industry too (garment development)."
31118,"Sry for being ignorant, Wouldn't NZ make better choice in case of woolen garment industry? You can make better brand there with local wool."
31119,Not ignorant at all! We are very strong in our wool farming and processing! But not so much in clothing manufacturing - it’s all sent overseas to be made. My brand is looking as manufacturing in NZ at the moment but it’s outrageously expensive and not very sustainable.
31120,Most of what you said has a good chance of being irrelevant. Is it brick layers moving to Oz or tech workers/social science workers? Having said that NZ might be like Eastern Europe; good opportunities for tech but not so good for the rest (social science)
31121,"It’s a whole range of unskilled, skilled and professionals leaving NZ for Australia.  Australia is the 13th largest economy in the world with a population of 24M.  NZ is the 53rd largest economy in the world with a population of 4.7M. The average living standard in NZ is not as high as outsiders think.  People should be circumspect when considering moving there. It’s a nice place, but that’s not enough for tens of thousands on NZers who leave for Australia every year."
31122,"A lot of the Kiwi's that go to Aus go to earn enough money to buy a house, they often come back. The ones that want to live urban stay overseas, as we don't have the population to support a large city/lifestyle."
31123,"Agreed.  I don’t think people, especially from Europe, understand these facts about NZ.  NZ is not interchangeable with say Australia or Canada."
31124,"Yes it's large (landmass), small (population), and expensive because of its isolation. I understand, I've lived in the Northern Hemisphere too, when you are used to the relative ease of travel and the relative cheapness/bounty of goods it's a hell of an adjustment to NZ and its little economy."
31125,"Yes, I also remember driving through the slums in Waikato. I was so shocked to see third world poverty in NZ."
31126,"You're literally describing Finland, except for the weather. I think the cold is really nice though, and the summers aren't too hot (although this summer has been terrible)"
31127,"I was about to suggset the same thing, but you're not wrong about this year's summer.

Though compared to Paris we had it easy, I guess!"
31128,The north of Spain fits pretty good with that description
31129,Seattle WA gets somewhat close
31130,"Southern Germany, soecifically Munich, checks all"
31131,"Seconded. Vienna too, but for tech stuff Munich is better yeah"
31132,Thirded. Munich would be perfect for OP.
31133,"I live in Stockholm and it ticks of all the boxes of your request. Especially if you want to live in a big city and be near nature. The biggest downside though is that it’s pretty difficult to find somewhere to live, at least in central Stockholm."
31134,"I can second this. Especially proximity to nature, great work-life balance and a thriving tech sector. All Nordic countries would check the boxes on the list but the tech sector is Stockholm's USP compared to the others."
31136,Canada sounds a lot like this in certain area.
31137,Except weather may be unless you are in parts of British Colombia.
31138,"Definitely not Canada. I live here. Weather is garbage in 99 percent of the country for about 80 percent of the year. 

There is little vacation time for most in comparison to Europe. Although 40 hour work week is common in some fields people work 60-80 hour weeks. Health care is universal but not as good as Germany."
31139,"I'll soon come live in Canada from France, I can understand what you're saying totally but it still has great points imo!"
31140,"Just wanted to say that Canada will treat you well. Some of the negative points described in response to your comment are apt for suburbs but not indicative of the whole country. I have lived in Europe and to compare, you will have much more social mobility here; be able to actually afford property and build real equity in a way that you can pass down to your children in a way that you cannot in Europe (we complain about the cost of buying houses in big cities like Toronto and Vancouver but *it doesn't hold a candle* to the expense of owning in Paris or London); buy whatever the hell car you want and not have to worry about a tax on the engine size; and outdoor activities are incredible here. It is an enormous country so many cities have built 'out' from the downtown cores, which leads to problems listed accurately in u/polskadz13's comment (parks are not as nice as Europe, too many Boston Pizza's, cookie-cutter neighbourhoods, comparatively weak public transit system, etc.) but the ease with which you can live outside of town and drive in is incredible. It is a great place. Many of us do not travel and live abroad ever in our lives and therefore begin to miss out on how unique Canada really is. Et nous parlons français aussi!"
31141,"Well, thank you a lot for all that, really, it helps me understand a lot more how things works in Canada!"
31142,"Canada isn't a terrible country. I'd rather live here than much of the world. But there are plenty of European countries that are a lot better. There are lots of faults with Canada that most immigrants don't see as they have rose coloured glasses on looking at Canada like the promised land.

Transportation systems here are horrendous. Unless you live in downtown of major cities a vehicle is essential to get anywhere.

The suburbs of major cities are just neighbourhoods of houses for kilometres with nothing else. Parks are just pieces of grass with nothing else in them with exception of a few such as High Park or Edwards Gardens in Toronto.

There is little culture, beautiful buildings, and restaurants for the most part are the same chains over and over again which aren't very good. Housing is very expensive in major cities and there's nothing in small towns. Crime is higher than most of Europe but Canadians only compare themselves to the United States so they think the crime is low."
31143,IT workers often work a lot more than 40hrs though.  We don't exactly have very clean cities though there are far worse.
31144,"Utopia?





Sorry, I just had to..."
31145,"Finland, or really all of the Nordics tick all those criteria except maybe weather."
31146,"I think you're describing Scotland. I mean...ppl say our weather's shite but climate change has made us warmer and the occasional floods are adding a bit of interest to the day....we've got plenty of nature - tourists come to climb our mountains and cycle. A 40 hour workweek sounds about right for most professions, generally pretty progressive, you;d have to look into healthcare eligibility a bit but it's mostly still free/low cost and pretty decent quality. Brexit might fuck youse up though - so be aware of that looming on the horizon."
31148,If I have a 40 hour work week in Heaven then I'm gonna sue God
31149,"There's no way heaven is clean. Do you know how many billions of people are up there? 

Housing has got to be crazy expensive as well. Cloud 9 keeps the rest of the clouds poor as dirt."
31150,West Coast of Canada has milder winter that the rest of the country and would meet the rest of your criteria.
31151,If clean cities and public spaces then skip Denmark.
31152,"I'm visiting Denmark soon. I envision it as cleaner than the U.S., but I guess we'll see."
31153,"Maybe cleaner than the US. Also, keep in mind that while visiting you wont see the actual situation. 

But Denmark is quite dirty as it is normal practice to spit gum on the street, pee anywhere you please etc. The worst part is during weekends - the litter is idiotic. The millenials here have no respect and trash everything. If municipalities didnt spend so much money on cleaning during weekends, the place would be fking ridicilous. And this is not exclusive to party zones, the whole city(all major DK cities) turn into trash so often. 

I come from Latvia, so one would assume its worse there but I have never experienced so much trash, litter and dirty streets as here. And I have lived here for 4 years and in 3 different regions."
31154,I can confirm this. As I was only there 4 days and saw two locals peeing right on a busy sidewalk. The second girl literally peed on the stairs to a closed business and it was only like 7 at night. Other than that Copenhagen was pretty great
31155,"CPH is superb place to visit. But not as great as all the hyped articles say, to live. Its very much quite subpar if you are not danish or very outgoing(even then questionable). Its not even most liveable place in Dk, I would say thats Aarhus."
31156,It seems CPH has the same problems as Helsinki when it comes to littering and bad behaviour in public. In Helsinki we have the exactly same things that you complained earlier about and I honestly wish there were tougher laws on littering the environment and acting badly in public but Nordic people are too tolerant of it.
31157,"Someone recently expressed to me that Eastern European cities tend to be very clean, and it may be a cultural thing. I was surprised to hear it too, but maybe that's the reason?

Anyway, in the U.S. we have plenty of pee, trash, and homeless, so I'm curious to see how DK compares in that regard.

Before I went to Prague a couple of years ago I read a blog from a European visitor who called it dirty. Then I got there and it was vastly cleaner than anything we have in the U.S. So I did somewhat develop the idea that this concept is relative."
31203,Canada
31159,Scotland (where I live) has most if not all of these things! I really like it
31160,Ecuador.
31161,"Do you guys even read? His list is pretty clear so why are you suggesting Switzerland and Nordics? Both are miserable 7 months out of the year.

31179,"Parts of the USA, in the right fields.

31180,">You need an advanced degree though, and to know just the right thing at the right time to get you that perfect position.

Are you referring to academia?"
31181,"No, an example would be an MS ECE or CS. Good way to get into a chip design or software role and work 40hr weeks."
31182,I believe the country you should be looking at is California.
31183,"As a European with roughly the same requirements as OP, I had previously ruled out the US based on healthcare"
31185,And if you don't?
31186,Yeah I've heard this argument often from Americans.  I'm hoping to not have to work high pressure jobs for the rest of my life.  What happens then?
31187,"What else Americans don't tell you is that great health insurance they get from work still has deductibles and caps. God forbid you get MS or require dialysis for the rest of your life, you'll get cut off at a certain point for treatment. No amount of extra money is worth that risk."
31189,"I'm a 30yo software engineer with ~10 years industry experience and a fair few accomplishments under my belt.  I _know_ that the premier place to live and work for my profession is around the bay area, but I just can't bring myself to relocate my family to the US.  Even looking past my healthcare concerns, guns scare the shit out of me and every time I've visited the US I have been on edge whenever I saw cop walking around with a firearm, knowing that he could kill or main me in a second"
31190,"I've been to that ""country,"" lol. The cities were quite dirty, and the housing is quite difficult to afford, which is why there are so many homeless, and most people work well over 40 hours a week. But I'd agree it has a lot to offer otherwise."
31191,Plus healthcare is far from guaranteed.
31192,"I think you're simplifying our homeless situation here in California, but yes we don't match up with your list. Not sure any place really does. 

Oh the mythical 40 hour week!"
31193,"Good healthcare? 40 hour workweeks? I got two words friend:
government 
job
Ideally a progressive urban municipality. 

I work for a municipality in Utah as such, here is where I stand:

Being close to beautiful nature for hiking, biking, etc.--hell yes. I can get to high alpine afterwork in the summer.

40 hour workweek or less--yes

Equality between genders, and progressive values in general--On a state level, no. county level, yes.

Guaranteed healthcare--Extremely Cheap

Clean cities and public spaces--Cities aren't generally clean but we're next to a lot of national parks

Mild weather, or at least warm Springs and Summers--Definitely warm springs and summers. Cold winters though.

A good economy for both tech fields (my partner's) and social science related things (my interest)--Social science, no. tech fields, yes. Generally though, our economy is great.

The US covers such a large geographic area and the broad political climate addresses each of your criterion by a wide variety in contrast to a small European country. You already speak the language and you're a citizen. It would be substantially easier to attain these goals here because of this. 

Chattanooga Tennessee would likely fulfill many of these as well."
31194,"Chattanooga sounds interesting to me, actually. I'd say for my local municipality whenever I've applied to a government job I've never so much as gotten an interview, though. I think a lot of people want those jobs for the exact same reason you suggest. When particular benefits aren't typical, they make a job more competitive."

Second, which country you ""like"" is irrelevant, as you need to ask do I qualify for a visa."
31200,"I know that visa rules vary by country. However, not having had the privilege to travel literally everywhere, a list of places to start that offer what we're looking for would help in narrowing it down."

31212,"I mean, I think if I wanted to increase my chances of getting an offer I'd do that by first obtaining the work visa to go look in-person, as I could almost certainly do for the Netherlands, Australia, or Canada. (Yes, I've read all the rules). But, that wasn't what I was asking here. It's always interesting to me when people just assume strangers haven't done research."

31227,"I really enjoyed Costa Rica - except for San Jose (one of the worst cities we visited - of the 75 odd we did around the world!!) but even it had some interesting communities. The towns we enjoyed were Monteverde, Uvita and San Isidro del General but never got to the north or coffee growing highlands. 
One thing I have learned is that people live in communities and even the “worst” countries/cities have some great communities. Most country related issues have little impact on ones day to day lifestyle."
31228,"That's fair. I did think Monteverde was beautiful (although small). I guess if we were both digital nomads that would open up a lot more options, period."
31230,"Well, progressive parts of the US will works for that (barring healthcare).
Many parts of western Europe correspond to what you are looking for, and add to that Australia and New Zealand. I'd personally chose the UK if I were you."

31232,I'd go for France
31233,The Masters program I've been accepted into is actually in France. Weather this summer has been crazy though. Are you in France yourself?
31234,"I don't live there, I've only visited a few times, actually just left the country a few days ago. I realize this summer has been an anomaly, but I think Northern France should be safer from the heat in general. I see your nickname is Montpellier and yeah that's almost Spain, it can be hot there, but I went to Lille not long ago and a local told be this summer has really been exceptional, said their summer weather is usually in the 20s (C). And Lille isn't even the veeery north of France. So I'm pretty sure it should be doable for you to find a place with weather that's good enough at least like 11 months of the year."

31239,"A lot of reasons. I think overall we are just a really arrogant country. Everyone I've ever met has this ""but we're Americans"" mentality that I don't really relate to. Also healthcare is more expensive, college is  more expensive, generally everything is more expensive."
31240,"Refusal of universal healthcare and common sense gun laws because they're ""communist""/""unpatriotic"", rampant patriotism in general, religious nutjobs and conservative hardliners with great influence in the country's politics, college education that will get you in debt so deep you'll have to work decades to pay it off, blowing 700 billion dollars a year on an overblown military, and of course your stable genius president. Yep, would not switch for that."

Firstly, for you war folks out there, we are placed in one of the most strategic positions in the world for fighting any of the eastern countries by boat or air. 

Secondly, for you economy people out there, we have the most abundant resources of precious stones, fuel, and coal in the southern hemisphere, and in the top 10 for the world.

Thirdly, 93% of our people live on the coast, and the temperature various between (on average) 5 degrees Celcius and 40, depending on where you live, so if you prefer certain climates, we do cater for all that.

Fourthly, our healthcare system is amazing. We recently pretty much bullied our government into stopping them charging a $20 fee to see the doctor. If you get sick, it's practically for free as part of our Medicare fund.

We have centrelink, which is pretty much free money. Australia doesn't actually have many homeless people, and by that, I mean I've seen 3 in my entire life. One of them is voluntarily homeless.

Fifthly/sixthly, for you geeks out there, we generally get games before other people, for you Nintendo fans, we have both of the New 3DS'. 

Seventhly, the culture is amazing. We have so many different people from all over the world, and we just love them. There is always going to be racism, sexism, and every nasty atrocity. But we look out for each other in Australia. Your mate is your mate, and he won't sue you for sneezing on him.

Now Australia does have sucky bits. It doesn't snow in 90% of the land, we sometimes get movies later than other people, and yes, we don't have Netflix. 

But hey, our accents. And try and find an ugly Aussie. I dare you."
31286,"Yeah, I'm an Australian and we have some butt ugly people."
31287,"In aus now, plenty of ugly folk here... Not a fan of the accent much either. Still enjoying my time here, but thus far NZ, for me, is a better place to live."
31288,Of course you think we're ugly. You favour NZ.
31289,Papa new guinea
31290,No doubt.
31291,Cyprus!
31292,Technically it is Norway. They score high on pretty much everything.
31293,"Hm, here in Scandinavia there has been a huge peak in racism and nationalism over the last years - so it depends"
31294,If I had to choose? Canada. Fuck the USA.
31295,"Hello from Canada guys. I'm sure all of your countries are fantastic as well, but I do love mine."
31296,And explain why! 🤔
31297,the ocean
31298,"Singapore if you anus, Taiwan if you hole"
31299,One of the Scandinavian countries. Probably Norway or Finland.
31300,"North Korea, because I love communism and fat people."
31301,"The US, usually. Right now, maybe not. But in general, the US. Yes, it's a shithole, but everywhere else is a deeper shithole."
