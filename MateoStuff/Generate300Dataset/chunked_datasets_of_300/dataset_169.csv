55256,Virginia’s triple crown loop I’m planning to hike it around that time of year
55257,"I have a moderately challenging suggestion. The Sipsey Wilderness in Bankhead National Forest. Located in northwest Alabama is is a very old growth forest and absolutely beautiful. The Sipsey river runs through the forest and is feed by a variety of large creeks and streams that must sometimes be traversed. There are boulder fields and large cliff faces. The terrain is moderately challenging, although can be very flat near the rivers. The trails will require map skills and the wilderness area will put to the test your basic outdoorsman skills. However, the area is completely secluded and you can completely escape civilization and man. One of my favorite backpacking destinations. I recommend the Thompson trailhead!"
55258,"Here's some websites to start you off:

[MidAtlantichikes](http://www.midatlantichikes.com/)

[Hiking Upward](http://www.hikingupward.com/)

[PAHikes](http://www.pahikes.com/)

These are all conveniently close to Maryland and should give you some ideas.  Two loop trips I can suggest are the [Allegheny Front Trail](http://www.pahikes.com/#owlcarousel-4297-1) and the [Trout Run Valley Circumnavigation](http://midatlantichikes.com/troutrunvalley.htm).  The latter has many views and requires some navigation skills."
55259,This sounds amazing! Might be a little too far for me unfortunately.
55260,"I'm doing the Loyalsock Trail in PA at the end of the month.  Website is outdated design-wise, but seems to have accurate info.  Facebook group is active and all trail reviews have been great.  I'm excited!  I'm planning on 5 days, but I think it could be done in 4 pretty easily if that didn't include any driving."
55261,Dolly Sods WV
55262,"This sounds great. But. May you consult some information.
 [best camping hammocks](http://campingheavens.com/camping-gears/best-camping-hammocks-2017/), 
[best camping pillows](http://campingheavens.com/camping-gears/best-camping-pillows/), 
[best camping cooler](http://campingheavens.com/camping-gears/best-camping-coolers/)

Have a great camping for you."
55263,"Grayson highlands on the Virginia/North Carolina border, if you don't mind the drive. It's on the AT but you can make a great 25 mile loop out of it."
55264,"I just looked it up and seems amazing. But its 9 hours away :(
I'll definitely add I to my list though!"
55265,Aaah that's a shame haha
55266,"Travel to PA and go up to potter/Clinton county. Hop on any of those trails like the Black Forest trail, STS, quehanna trail. Beautiful state with beautiful trails if you are willing to drive."
55267,Do you prefer one over the others? And do you know anything about the trails in the Catskills? If it's cool to hike them around this time of year?
55268,"Catskill mountains do have some nice trails but generally are shorter. You could always combine a few trails like the devils path. But nothing over 25 miles that I am aware of. There must be though, with some research. The STS is an 80 mile trail. The BFT is 42 miles. Or you could go down to Shenandoah and hike old rag mountain."
55269,Yeah I was checking out all three and BFT sounds and looks like the coolest one in my opinion
55270,"There's a great two day loop that starts at the woodland valley campground in the Catskills. Summits wittenberg, Cornell, slide and panther. Dispersed camping spots available."
55271,Come to New Brunswick (the Canadian province) and hike the fundy foot path. It is along the coast and through the woods.
55272,"Love Allgheny National Park, done tons of backing there!"
55273,"Have you booked the Batona trail yet? 50 miles through the Pine Barrens. I haven't done the whole thing, only a day hike since I didn't know about it until a month ago!"
55274,Midstate Trail in central Massachusetts .. also North-South in RI
55275,"Ashville,NC and Knoxville, TN. In appalachia. Great hiking biking in summer and skiing in winter. Both growing fast too."
55276,"Depends on how flexible your definition of ""city"" is. If you accept 20-50k then:

Burlington, VT

Manchester, NH

Augusta, ME

Concord, NH

Portland, ME

Charlottesville, VA

Asheville, NC

Boston, MA (honestly pretty close to mountains, rivers, lakes, and the oceans but the tourist traffic surge in the summer is absurd).

Brunswick, ME

Bangor, ME

Honestly it depends on city size and what you like to do. You want mountains and ocean? Just mountains? Lakes? Forests? Etc."
55277,"I would add Ithaca, NY"
55278,"Definitely not one of the major metros. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I have the impression that large cities on the east coast have a certain work culture that makes it harder to have the kind of flexible work schedules that outdoorsy people like.

Smaller cities may work well, such as Asheville."
55279,"Depends upon the job, as well as whether that's even relevant to the OP's question. It might be for retirement, or just visiting."
55280,"East tends to be live to work, West tends to be work to live."
55281,"That sounds like a huge generalization that's probably not true. I would think it has more to do with the culture of living in a big city vs a rural city or town. I really doubt people are working less in the west than they are in the east, the U.S. has an incredibly standardized work week for such a huge country with so many major industries.

Now, could the mentality be different? Sure, but I don't think they necessarily have more time."
55282,"Well we loved Portland, Maine the Wife & I but a little pricey. Rents were hovering around $1500 and homes around $250K. Trying to find something similar and a little less steep in price. We probably be making about $100K the Wife and I combined so might be doable. The snow is also a concerned think we could handle it but would prefer a City with less snow than CT.

Looking for a City that could be on or close to the Ocean or at least an hour drive away Has university or multiple higher ed facilities Decent size hospital Close to mountains and areas to hike Running and outdoor groups Places to kayak and camp near by Museum or two Good restaurants Areas to shop an possibly an outlet mall nearby Within an hour leave the urban life for the rural life."
55283,"Probably depends on the season. Summer humidity can be a pain on the east coast.

In general, I'd guess Miami, NYC, Boston, and DC."
55284,None of those are outdoorsy. They're the opposite: hyber-urban
55285,It's very easy to get to beaches and woods from New York City.
55286,"I don't know, I'd classify beaches as outdoorsy. Boston in the spring is full of runners and cyclists. NYC and DC are all very oriented on outdoor tourism.

If OP meant things like hiking or off roading, I'd assume he/she wouldn't ask for cities."
55287,"NYC is def not outdoorsy.  People I know who live in LA and SF ""go hiking"" on the weekend and stuff.  Have literally never meant anyone here that does that."
55288,"TBH, OP added a comment after I replied clarifying what he/she is seeking. 

I answered considering the question asked about ""cities"" and NYC tourism is based on being outdoors - Times Square, Liberty Island, walking the city, Central Park, etc."
55289,"None of those fit... Miami is especially not outdoorsy. There is a beach and that's pretty much it. There's nowhere to hike. The Everglades is a river of floating grass populated by alligators under a cloud of mosquitos.

Also, being outdoors here outside of December through February is generally an unpleasant experience."
55290,">NYC = outdoorsy

lmao"
55291,"Jules Verne's Around the world in 80 days

Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusue

Robert Louis Stevenson Treasure Island

William Golding's Lord of Flies

Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness

Douglas Adams's Hitchickers Guide to the Galaxy"
55292,"I would add the ""The Mysterious Island"" by Jules Vernes to the list above.
Check out any of Edgar Rice Burroughs's books.
My personal favorites are

* Barsoom series
* Tarzan series
* Caspak series"
55293,"I LOVE Lord of the rings! I read it about a month ago and since then, I've been obsessed. I bought The Hobbit, then he Silmarillion, followed by The Children of Húrin. Currently reading Beren and Lúthien. Just ordered Unfinished Tales. I can't get enough of Tolkien!"
55294,"The Martian did that for me. A whole planet, hardly explored and all alone fighting for survival. Couldn't put it down."
55295,Steve Jobs biography. Not joking.
55296,"*Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift.  

As a kid, I had read an abridged and illustrated version of the popular Lilliput episode and liked it well enough. But it was only later when I read the book in its original unabridged form that I grew to appreciate Swift's vibrant imagination and ingenuity. The world-building really impressed me, and the curiosity to know what sort of people/creatures the titular character would encounter and what their interactions would bring kept me turning the pages. I also found it really neat how Swift managed to weave social commentary and satire into what seems like a simple adventure story on the surface."
55297,"I find most sci-fi, and maybe especially the works of Peter F. Hamilton to do this for me, probably because he spends so much time (and words) on worldbuilding, Just the beautifully realized worlds really lets me experience the places where adventure happens so nicely."
55298,"**Musashi**, by Eiji Yoshikawa.

Without a doubt.  It's the greatest adventure novel of all time!"
55299,"If you want adventure, try Rafael Sabatini's books. If you read several of his books you night notice some plot elements get repeated, but they're still great fun. *Captain Blood*, *Scaramouche*, and *The Sea Hawk* are, I think, his best-known.

And of course I have to add my usual plug for the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Some of the best historical fiction around.

Sword and sorcery adventure: Conan the Barbarian stories by Robert E. Howard. Very good light entertainment. Howard is no Tolkien, but he does evoke something of the same feeling of an entire world out there of which he's only telling parts. There are various pastiches of Conan, but they're generally not quite as good as the original stories. Amazon has a Kindle edition of Conan for $0.99."
55300,I'm finally reading the His Dark Materials trilogy (by Philip Pullman). I wish I'd read it as a kid but I'm still getting swept up in the adventure. He's built such a fascinating world.
55301,"Endymion, some seem to dislike it because it's not like first two parts of the series. It's just a scifi-adventure book. I liked it a lot."
55302,Eco's 'Foucault's Pendulum' and  'Prague Cemetery'. Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's 'Illuminatus' trilogy. Aleister Crowley's 'Book of Thoth'. Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon' and 'Baroque Cycle'
55303,"> Eco's 'Foucault's Pendulum' and 'Prague Cemetery'

This. I'm sad that I'll probably never find another author whose books click with me on the same level."
55304,Part of the reason why I'm so slow to read his others.
55305,The Belgariad series by David Eddings.  It's a five book fantasy series.
55306,"Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive.

Say hello to modern day Tolkien.

ALSO

100% Try out The Name of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

Brandon's worldbuilding is the best I have ever read, and I read A LOT.

Rothfuss' Name of The Wind is amazingly adventurous, big book but I read it in one sitting!

Enjoy whatever you choose to read next anyway!"
55307,">Say hello to modern day Tolkien.


lol chill"
55308,I'm cool as ice
55309,"I'm a fan of Sanderson, but he writes fun, approachable, adventures that are one step above YA in tone and depth.

I'm not trying to knock him, his books really are well done, but Tolkien he is not."
55310,I suppose it is down to individual taste.
55311,Rothfuss is a king.
55312,Brandon Sanderson infuses this adventure and epic feel to his books. Also Patrick Rothfuss with his kingkiller chronicles. It's just one big adventure. These two are my favourite authors after having read books from over 50 fantasy authors.
55313,"It isn't grand adventure in perhaps the same mould but for relentless savagery and the feeling you are definitely on the wild ride with him you could try The Revenant, which is a brilliant book."
55314,"I've really been enjoying the Books of the Raksura series by Martha Wells lately. It's a high fantasy in a world completely unpopulated by humans, which is pretty hard to find anymore. The main characters spend a lot of time traveling around, encountering new races, seeing weird ecological systems, fighting strange enemies, and dealing with complicated tribal politics. I'd highly recommend it if you want a series filled with adventure and unusual settings."
55315,"While I wasn't particularly smitten by *The Lies of Locke Lamora*, there's no denying its feel of a grand Robin Hood-esque adventure."
55316,Anything by Defoe.
55317,"well lotr is the quintessential adventure series, and in my humble opinion nothing has come close to matching it in that regard. you'd probably be better off not comparing the novels that you read to lotr.

as for your question, i thought that mark twain's joan of arc was a wonderful adventure novel. the portrait it paints of 15th century france and its struggles is wonderful imo, and twain's prose does a really good job of keeping you immersed in joan's journey."
55318,"*At the Mountains of Madness* is my most recent read that evokes that feeling. And I might be the only one who feels this way, but if you approach *Moby Dick* in that spirit you may be rewarded."
55319,"Lord of the Rings is really special; difficult to replicate, and certainly not something seen often.  Harry Potter might be the best recent example.

I recall *The Worm Ouroboros* by Eddison being somewhat similar to LoTR, but I'll defer to someone who's read it this decade.

The Culture Series by Iain M. Banks is somewhat similar, in a sci-fi/space opera setting.  First book is *Consider Phlebas*.  The books are all separate stories, but form a massive story arc in the Culture universe.

Finally suggestion is the Allan Quatermain series, by H. Rider Haggard.  Adventures in African during the Scramble for Africa.  Includes *King Solomon's Mines*."
55320,"- *Ghostwritten* by David Mitchell
- *Against the Day* by Thomas Pynchon
- *Mason & Dixon* by Thomas Pynchon
- *The Savage Detectives* by Roberto Bolaño
- *The Bone Clocks* by David Mitchell
- *V.* by Thomas Pynchon
- *The Stand* by Stephen King"
55321,"I can't talk about fantasy, but scifi books does that for me. For example Aurora by Kim Stanley Robinson, which was really big adventure :)"
55322,Kings of the Wyld did it for me.
55323,"Watership Down takes the cake for me.  I love Richard Adams' writing in that novel.  Pirate Latitudes by Michael Crichton was really enjoyable for me too.  I don't have much to compare to though, because this is not a genre that I frequent."
55324,"I resisted reading Watership Down for years. Afterall, I'm a grown man, why the hell would I read a book about rabbits? 

I was so wrong. What a fantastic read."
55326,The Dark Tower series is excellent!  A very unique journey
55327,"The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander
Read these as a kid, love them even more as an adult."
55328,Treasure island and the count of monte cristo
55329,"Considering the Count of Monte Cristo, which is the first one? I understand there are MANY books in this series, is CoMC the first?"
55330,It's the only one written by Dumas
55331,"I did not realize until this moment that The Three Musketeers and CoMC were written by the same person. 
Wow, I feel like such a dumas."
55332,Monte Cristo is SO GOOD. Get the Robin Buss translation. It's unabridged and is excellent.
55333,CoMC is actually just one big book.
55334,"First on my mind is The Hobbit. 

Cause my thoughts are now into parallel dimensions adventures. The Long Earth and The Devil Will Drag You Under by Jack Chalker."
55335,"""She"" by H. Rider Haggard springs to mind."
55336,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDajrwMF5To
55337,Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. A gem.
55338,The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
55339,Check out H Rider Haggard & HG Wells!
55340,"The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson

It's actually 8 books contained within three volumes. Worth it. Globe trotting adventure taking place in the 17th and 18th centuries. I can't describe it, there's no way."
55341,"Not exactly one book, but the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" by C. S. Lewis"
55342,"If you have any interest in flight at all look up Wind, Sand, and stars. Dude is lost in the Sahara desert for awhile. True story"
55343,The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellows. He is a true American master.
55344,[On Stranger Tides](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15670.On_Stranger_Tides) by Tim Powers
55345,"Try The Talisman, by Stephen King. The more times I suggest it, the more I want to read it again."
55346,I read the description for this and it sounds like exactly what I've been looking for.  Thanks for this.
55347,"You're welcome. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The sequel is amazing, as well."
55348,"Hate to be one of the chorus of endless voices screaming it, but here goes anyway:

GEORGE RR MARTIN A Song of Ice and Fire!!

Yes it is fantasy. It is light on magic and HUGE on adventure. I say all this knowing you have either already read it or already heard about it. But if you haven't read it, I think you should.

One man's opinion. Let the downvotes roll!"
55349,"great suggestion. such a good series. downvotes be damned, it should be mentioned at least once. It's terrific."
55350,Thanks for the suggestion.  It must be good if that many people are suggesting it.
55351,"Seriously, this series is utterly enthralling. I began to read it and was totally hooked in the first few pages. The characters are the most 3 dimensional I have ever seen. My wife wanted to watch the TV series on HBO, since she had heard myself and others talking about the books.

I sat with her through the first 10 minutes of the first HBO episode. I then realized the book could NOT be captured on screen. So much of what happens is in the minds of the characters, and there is NO way to translate those thoughts to the TV screen, no matter how good the actor.

I turned the TV off, mid-episode, and said to my wife, ""Trust me. You want to read the books. THEN watch the series.""

My wife does trust me, completely, as I do her. She bought the books and within the hour was glued to her Kindle. And she understood, within the first chapter, why I stopped the TV show. It is that good. She just caught up to and passed the TV episodes in her reading. It led to some close calls, as spoilers are everywhere it seems, but she made it and is now beyond the TV series. Safe, in other words, from encountering memes or online jokes or posts that are spoilers.

I suggest you stay far away from anything that might be a spoiler, once you actually start reading this series. It is huge and unfinished, but I think any serious reader will enjoy it.

Sorry for all the words. I am feeling a bit like George myself, though he sure tells a much better story than I!"
55352,"For fun, adventurey adventure stories, [Kidnapped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_(novel) or [Treasure Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island), both by Robert Louis Stevenson, are fantastic and easy to read. For something with a bit more bite, Raphael Sabatini's [Scaramouche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche_(novel) (""He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad, and this was his only inheritance,"" and all that) or [Captain Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(novel). Both seem to fit pretty well with what you list in your request. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Jules Verne, and Jack London all would come up in a complete list of the best and most famous adventure novelists, as well. 

If you wouldn't mind some early ""spy"" fiction, John Buchan's [Richard Hannay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hannay) books walk the line between spy and adventure novels.

For something that skews somewhat heavier, it's hard to go wrong with Conrad when you are looking for adventure. [Lord Jim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jim) is powerful, and [Nostromo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostromo) is unbelievably good and shamefully overlooked due to the common use in class and corresponding (undeserved) unpopularity of *Heart of Darkness*, though *Nostromo* is more ""historical"" fiction than adventure.

Sorry this post got so long, but I hope it helps!"
55353,No need to apologize! I'll definitely be checking some of these out.  Thanks!
55354,Scaramouche is free for Kindle!!
55355,"[Bloody Jack](http://www.goodreads.com/series/41931-bloody-jack) series by LA Meyer. Set in various locations in the early 1800s, with a naval/nautical flair. Not particularly intellectual, but very entertaining and action-packed. I'm up to book 6 so far (mostly listening to the audiobooks, which are brilliant), and haven't gotten bored yet."
55356,To this I would also add CS Forester's Horatio Hornblower series and Patrick O'Brians Aubrey–Maturin series and you'd about have the nautical realm covered.
55357,*Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss. Some of the best characters I've ever met.
55358,"Wilbur Smith's Sean Courtney trilogy. When the Lion Feeds, The Sound of Thunder, and Sparrow Falls. 

Fantastic adventure series about a boy then man in South Africa at the turn of the century. They got me back into reading a few years ago after many years of not loving books."
55359,These sound interesting. Thanks for the suggestion.
55360,"*The Wheel of Time*, Robert Jordan. Do it.   
Edit: And if you haven't read them, *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are the original gangstas of this genre."
55361,"Thanks for the suggestion , I'll check it out"
55362,"Alistair MacLean books are great adventures

Alan Furst's pre- and during WWII novels are mainly about people who find themselves taking on new self-imposed duties as the political situation deteriorates.

Helen MacInnes wrote Cold War spy stories where often amateurs got pulled in and had to improvise.

Dick Francis novels often this theme."
55363,"I strongly recommend Joe Abercombie's five  somewhat noir low-fantasy novels, the first of which is *The Blade Itself*. His work is very character-driven, and first-rate."
55364,I see a lot of good suggestions here. You might also like some Heinlein-*Glory Road* & *Job:A Comedy of Justice* sort of fit.
55365,"[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) is basically this. Yes, it's set in space and all, but it's more of a humorous adventure novel than a sci-fi novel. I think it can appeal to almost anyone. You'll especially appreciate the early chapters.

Another great option is [The Sot-Weed Factor](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24835.The_Sot_Weed_Factor). A very funny ""history"" novel, and you'll never look at the early Pilgrims the same way again.

Also try [If on a Winter's Night a Traveler](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler) and [A Wild Sheep Chase](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase). They are wonderful."
55366,The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever.
55367,Rogues of the Republic series by Patrick Weekes.  First book is The Palace Job.
55368,"Thanks for the rec, i'll go see if I can read a sample!"
55369,The Grey Bastards
55370,"Thanks for the rec, but i've already read this one. and I have to say I enjoyed looking at the Raymond Swanland cover art."
55371,"Company of Strangers by Melissa McShane is a fun book. It’s a pretty basic premise, strangers group up to go explore some ruins. 

The Copper Promise by Jen Williams - three adventurers try to figure out what’s going on and explore some ruins. 

Also, check out Barrayar by Lois McMaster Bujold. That kicks off the Miles Vorkosigan books and that is some of the absolute best character driven space opera out there."
55372,"Company of Strangers sounds fun! and its cheap which is always a bonus :) I'll go look at some reviews/sample

The Copper promise is/was a DNF for me, its been sitting on 5% read for over 3 years now on my kobo, for no discernible reason. 

I read Shards of Honor, and I really didn't like that, the whole prisoner of war/captor to lovers, with the rape threats to the other non lucky lady sailors just never sat right with me, that i'm not that interested in picking up other Vorkosigan books."
55373,"Shards of Honor is really an outlier in the series. I think it’s probably the weakest book out of all of them. I always suggest new readers start with Barrayar because it’s a better introduction to the series and the recurring cast of characters. 
Cordelia and Aral take a backseat once Miles is born and then all the fun shenanigan start. Don’t judge the series based on Shards of Honor. It’s nothing like the rest of the series."
55374,"I also keep hearing this! Maybe I'll cave in someday :)

But In my copy of Shards Bujold talks about her suggested reading order and it started with Shards. and do the first 2 cordelia novels before jumping into Miles. 

and i'm a weird stickler about publication order... 

Maybe some day :)"
55375,"I thought of another rec

Fortunes Pawn by Rachel Bach, it’s a pen name
for Rachel Aaron for her science fiction books. It’s about a mercenary who joins up with a ship crew. Found family and lots of adventures and some romance."
55376,"Have you read the Gentleman Bastards series by Scott Lynch? The sequel, **Red Seas Under Red Skies**, is actually my favorite of the lot precisely because it's so much like an Ocean's 8-11 heist. :)

It is criminal heist, but has great found family and a good amount of self contained plot to each."
55377,"I have, and red seas is also my favourite! mainly because of the pirate  ladies. but Republic was the last book of the series I'll likely read, because I got tremendously bored with flashback structure of the novels, that don't seem to serve a real point anymore."
55378,"The Greatcoats series by Sebastien de Castell, definitely.
A trio of musketeer-like characters trying to rebuild the peacekeeping order they were part of before their king was murdered and it was disbanded.

Lots of witty banter and prettt much going from adventure to another adventure on their travel.

First book is not long and can be satisfying as standalone i’d say."
55379,Thanks! this book keeps coming and dropping off my radar. I should bite the bullet :)
55380,"I would say Catfishing on CatNet may work for you depending on the sort of SF you want. It's very feel good and found family... while also being pretty action packer near future SF thriller for the most part, if that makes any sense. The premise is basically a group of close internet friends and AI moderator from a cat picture forum, have to come together for the protagonist who is always on the run with her mom from a potentially abusive father (obviously warnings for that element)."
55381,"Well that's a premise I haven't heard before. 

I don't think its what i'm after currently. but I do enjoy seeing these weird-concepts."
55382,"If u don't mind animated series, I highly, ***highly*** recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender. If you're looking for something a lot  darker, then the Castlevania series on Netflix is great.

As for novels, I'd recommend the Cradle series by Will Wight and Never Die by Rob J Hayes."
55383,"I think you’d really love THE FIRST LAW series, the characters are incredible and the action gets really wild."
55384,"Say one thing about Joe Abercrombie, Say I've read them all."
55385,"We have some cross over tastes, so let's see:

Fuzzy Nation by John Scazli - you also might like Agent to the Stars, but it's not nearly as adventuring, but still quite good. Both are standalones.

Rogues of the Republic by Patrick Weekes - heisty fun of a bunch of misfits and rogues having to steal elven porn. Provided there are no virgins around to distract the unicorn's attention.

The Labyrinth Gate by Kate Elliott/Alis Rasmussen - portal fantasy standalone where the couple end up in a alt-Victorian London. Complete with Victoria-style archeology and puzzles."
55386,"I've read both of those Scalzi's already, and I do like Scalzi :)

And Oeh, I really Dig Kate Elliott and stand-alones."
55387,"I hadn't even realized it was you (that's what I get for not looking at the username)! I'd have recommended slightly different LOL

Nnedi Okorafor and Alan Dean Foster's Kabu Kabu (it's in the short story collection of the same name). It's a novella they cowrote and it's amazing fun. 

Simon R Green's Nightside, then Secret Histories (in that order) - It's definitely not high fiction or anything, but it scratches that urban fantasy/adventure/different itch for me. Loads of adventure, really different characters, etc."
55388,">I hadn't even realized it was you (that's what I get for not looking at the username)! I'd have recommended slightly different LOL

I have seen this comment before. somewhere in a thread I made about adventure book recommendations...  xD

Thanks for the recs!"
55390,"I enjoyed Orconomics, just never felt the need to pick up the sequel, might be worth a revisit.

and man, Glenn Cook is one of my favourite authors. (talking about Raymond Swanland Art, I love my omnibus editions of the black company and dread empire chronicles)"
55391,"Urban fantasy tends to be really good about found families since the relationships have time to grow over many books.

Some of my favourites in that genre in that regard are:


**Innkeeper series by Ilona Andrews**: The central setting is an intergalactic magical bed & breakfast in Texas that hosts aliens visiting Earth. There's the Innkeeper Dina, her resident guest who is a former galactic tyrant, a cute monstrous dog, a neighbor werewolf who pisses on Dina's apple trees but turns out to be a nice guy, recurring space vampire guests etc. And in book 2 when the inn hosts peace negotiations between three warring alien species, the inn gets a wonderful new chef. There is a slow burn romance.

This series is my all time favourite comfort read. Although fair warning, book 2 always makes me cry. But they're very cathartic tears. These books also make me laugh out loud. I gifted the books to a friend and she said the same. Ilona Andrews writes awesome action and banter.

You can totally read just book 1 and not read on if you don't feel like it. These books are also a bit shorter than your average 90K urban fantasy books.

**InCryptid series by Seanan McGuire**. A family of cryptozoologists researches and tries to protect magical critters from monster hunters. There are three siblings and each gets at least 2 books of their own, then we shift the point of view character.

We see many generations of family and their wisdom is shared in chapter epigraphs as quotes. There are also the wonderful speaking Aeslin mice that worship the family members and remember their deeds as their holy liturgy.

You could easily read just the first book and leave off with it since the story of that book has a good ending.

**October Daye by Seanan McGuire**: A half-fae PI has lost her mortal family due to magical shenanigans and needs to find her place in the treacherous Fae world. Toby gathers a wonderful found family around her. There's a mentor, scary mentor, eventually a squire, eventually a found sister (and her real family who are peaces of work. Ugh), a love interest and many, many friends.

I suppose you could stop reading after book 1 but this series pays off the most as a series."
55392,Innkeeper sounds super fun thanks for the recommendations. :)
55393,Maybe try the shorts by John Scalzi.
55394,"I do love John Scalzi, but I'm not sure what work this refers to?"
55395,"When he was building a following, there were a ton of short stories he release for like $1 each.  I just looked and couldn’t find them.  One of the titles I remember was “We only need the heads.”  He may have put them together in something more marketable."
55396,"There's ""Nothing but the squeal"" for sure, which is silly fun. I got it in a Humble Bundle, though. I don't know if it's on its own. But...it's just a short story."
55397,"Read Drew Hayes. Super Powereds, NPCs, Villain's Code, or Second Hand Curses. 

Dose realy fun books and the characters are so wll done the feel like old freinds."
55398,"Have you read Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay? A colourful cast of characters for sure. A band of rebels disguised as itinerant musicians are trying to free their lands from a couple of powerful tyrants by playing them off against one another. 

It is intertwined with a second, more tragic tale that revolves around one of the tyrants and his favourite concubine."
55399,"I have! I love GGKs Prose, he has that melancholic tragic tone that cuts through everything. 

my favourite GGK is Sailing to Sarantium."
55400,"If GGK's prose and character styling is your jam, and you don't mind slumming it in the Mos Eisley Cantina of fantasy sub-genres (LitRPG), check out my story, Dive: Endless Skies. It's a found family, fast action story with a fresh-faced heroine learning the ropes from lethal mercenaries who are more than meets the eye.

Alternatively (and let's be real, much more promising), if you haven't read the Traitor Son Cycle by Miles Cameron, give that a go. It has the hallmarks of epic fantasy BUT I think fits your bill with the pace, humor, and cast of wildly entertaining characters similar to Kings of the Wyld.

As a weird extra option, there is also Priest of Bones. It is very aptly described as Peaky Blinders in a medieval, low fantasy world. Kind of grim, but again, strong humor and very engaging cast of characters."
55401,"Unfortunately, I don't buy books from Amazon.  But I can't say that Litrpg has been my wheelhouse. 

I have read the Red Knight, and its was fine, but the tropey hooks about wayward princes just wasn't something I had interest in pursuing. 

Priest of Bones sounds interesting!

Thanks for the recommendations"
55402,"Absolutely, if that description of Priest of Bones sounds good to you, then you will have a blast with it.

I assume avoiding Amazon is an ethical stance, and if so understandable. If you are ever interested in dipping a toe into LitRPG, message me and I can just email you the .epub file of Dive as a starter. Oh! Or check out Royal Road for free, completely non-Amazon reading. The editing on that site is...well, there isn't...but you get what you pay for, as the saying goes."
55403,"Both ethical, and convenience with my chosen e-reader.  But I also understand that Litrpg lives and breathes on kindle unlimited, and going wide is considered a risky bet in the genre."
55404,"That it does, but the winds of change are blowing, I think. Most of our authors are self-pub and there's just no beating the ease to publish that Amazon provides for a newbie. However, the hybrid imprints are figuring things out and getting better every day. I have faith that Portal or Wraithmarked or someone will figure out a direct distribution channel to the niche but voracious readers of LitRPG at some point."
55405,"“Last of the Breed” by Louis L’Amour

“Lucifer’s Hammer” by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle."
55406,"Lucifer's Hammer was such a damn blast. I remember my sister's boyfriend letting me read his copy and constantly talking about how great it gets once the comet fell. Took me forever to get there, but holy hell. I read the following 400 pages in about four days, it was just so damn good. And the reliance on Hard Science just makes it that much better. The idea that that could really happen exactly as described makes the whole read so much more astonishing.  
Might very well be one of the most underrated novels of all time. I wish more people would read it."
55407,"I'm a huge fan, as well. This book was the reason I hated the movie ""Deep Impact"" so much."
55408,"If you liked Lucifer's Hammer check out  
**Dies The Fire by SM Stirling** - start of a long series, becomes more fantasy later, but this book is a great look at what would happen if technology just stopped.  
**The Peshawar Lancers - also by Stirling** - a slightly steam punk exploration of what happens when a comet hits in the Victorian era and what results."
55409,"I saw this comment and decided to read the book it promotes. let me just say, despite the first 20% of the novel being rather slow (ad at times disjointed) exposition, I'm 50% through and it has been nothing less than an exquisite read so far."
55410,*White Fang* by Jack London.
55411,"I loved White Fang so much, honestly. It just felt like such a grand adventure, more so than any book I've ever read. I liked it so much because it didn't drag as much as a lot of adventure novels, it just enough to the imagination and never felt padded."
55412,"There's a lot of it but I really dig The Count on Monte Cristo. Sprawling story, vivid characters and treasure - seems to have it all."
55413,"Yep, Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo is epic! Same with The Three Musketeers."
55414,"Terry Pratchett’s comical fantasy adventure The Colour of Magic, the first book of the Discworld series."
55415,"Heart of Darkness.

More of a philosophic adventure, but they do go through colonial Africa on a boat which is pretty neat to me. However, it has very dense prose which subjects from the action a bit."
55416,"""Treasure Island"". That is an adventure to the highest degree."
55417,Amen to that!

55424,On the Road by Jack Kerouac
55425,"Not a novel per se, but ""Lost City of Z"" by David Grann is a fantastic read. Tells the story or a real-life adventurer and fortune seeker who disappeared searching for a rumored city in the South American jungles. It's literary nonfiction, so it reads more like a novel than a history book but includes a ton of corroborating research done by Grann (who is a great writer anyway)."

55434,The Hobbit and The Odyssey are my favorites for sure. I also started Journey to the West a few days ago and it's also quite amazing
55435,"For a throw-back, Lost World type of read, try The First Men In The Moon."
55436,"I don't know what Lost World is, but Mara and Dann by Doris Lessing is really good- a brother and sister making their way across the African continent, much changed, after a new Ice Age has swept away our current civilisation."
55437,"Try *Amazonia* by James Rollins. Not the greatest literature ever, but it's quite entertaining and it has that ""Lost World"" feel to it."

Edit: Just noticed the ""Lost World"" bit.  This doesn't fit that, but still a great adventure novel!"
55442,Peter Heller's *The Dog Stars*
55443,"hmm i dont know if lost world refers to dinosaurs or just lost world in general.  maybe try the Island in the sea of time series by sterling.  some action, fun read, the contemporary island of nantucket is sent back to neolithic era."
55444,The Riyria Revelations by Michael Sullivan might be something you'd like. I'm now about 100 page sinto the first book Theft of Swords and it is pretty much a fighter and a rogue having adventures after being wrongly accused of killing the king.
55445,"This was going to be my number 1 recommendation. It's exactly what you're looking for. It's a lot of fun, full of action and adventure, has some excellent characters and limited POVs."
55446,Hey thanks for the kind words!
55447,"No problem, thanks for writing some awesome books. I'm starting Chronicles soon."
55448,Great! I hope you enjoy them.
55449,"I'd also like to express my appreciation for the series.   I'm listening to the audiobooks, since I have precious little time for actual reading these days, and am eagerly awaiting my next audible credit to get the next book. Only have made it through the first book, and he two shorts ""Jester"" & ""Professional Integrity,"" but can already tell it's going to end up being one of my new favorite series. I might have to breakdown next payday and buy the next one outright!"
55450,"Hey, thanks so much for stopping by. Audio books are great (especially when read by Tim Gerard Reynolds). So glad you are continuing on in the series. If/when you get done with Heir of Novron, drop me a line and I'll send you an afterword that you might enjoy."
55451,"I shall do that, thanks! I just got an offer from audible to pick up 3 extra credits at a 20% discount, so I plan on using them all on these. I've already recommended the series to a friend that just finished the the last Locke Lamora book and was quite upset the next one wasn't out yet. I will be sure to check out your other works once I make it though these."
55452,Hey thanks both for the support and for spreading the word. It is greatly appreciated. Hope you enjoy the rest.
55453,"Just finished Rise, and jumped right into Heir. Really enjoying the series!"
55454,"Nice!  Heir is my favorite of that series - I hope you enjoy how it wraps up.  When you're done, drop me a line and I'll send you an afterword you might enjoy."
55455,Just finished! Excellent ending. This book almost had me in tears at a couple places. Off to start the prequel series! Did I see somewhere that you are writing a series that takes place after revelations?
55456,"Late to the show here but wanted to say this thread directed me to your Riyria books about a month ago. I just finished them and loved them! I especially appreciated the time you took to let the reader enjoy the simple moments - time in the taverns, in the village, on the road by the camp fire."
55457,"Sounds good, have you finished the whole series? Is there a kind of arc to it or are they just a continued series of adventures?"
55458,"I wrote all six books of The Riyria Revelations before publishing the first. It was necessary because there was a long running arc that needed to be carefully plotted. The story starts out remarkably simply - but it grows in stakes and scope to become an epic fantasy.   Each book has it's own conflict and resolution, but there is an overarching plot (and several sub-plots) that span multiple books.

The Riyria Chronicles are done in a slightly different way. They are designed to be a series of standalone novels. For instance there are people who have read The Death of Dulgath (book #3) without #1 and #2 and it works just fine. The reason for that is I'm writing the prequels because people missed the pair after the end of Riyria Revelations. I don't want them to overstay their welcome so the plan is to release a book, take the pulse of the readers, and only release another one if it looks like people still want more. Presently there are three of these prequels and there will be a fourth...I'm just not sure when.  I'm currently doing edits on a new series of which the first book came out a few months ago."
55459,"It has a somewhat overarching thematic premise, but it is made up of some interesting subplots and subthemes. 

I thought the first book, while have a very interesting story, was not very well written. However, I could not put it down. 

That being said, the second and third books were fantastic. The author really got into a groove with his writing and improved immensely."
55460,"Hey thanks for sticking with the series and I'm glad you like how things wrapped up. IIRC The Crown Conspiracy (book #1 of that series was written in 2002, so yeah many moons ago. I hope I've improved and keep improving. That's part of what's great about writing there is always more to learn and do."
55461,"Thanks for the response,  mate. I felt that some of the writing was weak in the first book,  yet I still couldn't put it down! I think that is indicative of something,  something special. I did notice massive improvement in the next two books.

Please,  understand that I'm a huge fan and I'm super excited to read whatever you put out next. You're an air some writer and seeing the progression was honestly a very interesting part of reading your books. 

All the best."
55462,"I didn't take offense at the comment. Just wanted to provide some context. Glad to hear you are a fan, never tire of talking to people who enjoy the books."
55463,"I've read the initial trilogy, Riyria Revelations and yes, it's very adventurey. The first two books are basically 4 individual little adventures of about 300 pages each and the final book is one big finale. 

It just follows these two friends, a notorious thieves guild, as they get swept up in more and more important events that require their skills or obligations."
55464,"Thanks for reading them. I plotted the series to start out simply and end ""big."" I think the approach has done well."
55465,"There are 6 books, coupled together as Theft of Swords (1&2), Rise of Empire(3&4), and Heir of Novron(5&6). Each book has its own arc, that the next one builds upon. There are also 3 prequels about Royce and Hadrian's life together before the Revelations series."
55466,Precisely.
55467,"Thanks, I'm pretty sure I've heard that series mentioned on here quite a bit. Isn't the author a contributor on here or something?"
55468,He's an active member of the subreddit yeah (/u/michaeljsullivan). Which adds to my guilt of letting Riyria languish on my TBR list for too long!
55469,Just had a look at this on Amazon and Goodreads and I think it sounds just what I wanted. I'll read some of the other recommendations below first but definitely putting this on the future-reads list!
55470,"I don't think I've ever heard bad things about it :). It's near the top of my TBR list, but that's still like 15 books deep. One day!"
55471,"I couldn't be happier with the reception of my books. I'm just writing tales that I would like to read, and luckily there are others who do as well."
55472,"Great - Just FYI - I have a few free shorts that you can try out to see if the style is to your liking.  Best way to get them is on Audible 

* The Jester
* Professional Integrity

If you aren't into audio books, drop me a line and I'll send you an ebook sampler of shorts that you can use to try before you buy."
55473,P. S. The fact that you hang out in this subreddit is awesome. Tha KS for contributing.
55474,It's a great place to hang out. Really enjoy being here.
55475,"Don't feel guilty. As long as you are reading books you are enjoying, that's all that really matters. But thanks for the page."
55476,He shows up from time to time - and it's always best if he does so after coffee. ;-)
55477,Hey thanks for recommending Riyria - Always good to know people enjoy it enough to tell others.
55478,My number one recommendation as well!
55479,Just finished the audiobook of ToS. Can't wait for my next credit with audible to come in to get the next one. Got to wait about 3 more weeks though. I burned through this one fast lol.
55480,The Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories by Fritz Leiber - they're collections of loosely-connected adventures rather than single long novels for the most part. These had a huge influence on D&D games and modern RPG archetypes and tropes.
55481,I came here to make sure someone mentioned these. :-) I love these stories. Great fantasy adventures.
55482,"The Deed of Paksennarion trilogy by Elizabeth Moon.  One of my absoloute favourites.

(I'd give a better write up, but I'm just killing time in my phone while waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom.)

Edit:  Ok, seems like they're going to be a while.  Sooooo...

It is a trilogy about a young woman becoming a paladin.  Moon was a marine, so her work is often heavy on the military side of things.  This trilogy is classic heroic fantasy.  Moon has a very straight forward narrative style that I particularly enjoy.  She keeps the story going.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0671721046/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471874183&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=the+deed+of+paksenarrion&dpPl=1&dpID=516xgmQAL0L&ref=plSrch"
55483,"I second this, I absolutely love this series. Great protagonist and a strong sense of adventure as you follow Paks."
55484,"Lies of Locke Lamora hits most of these notes and is absolutely wonderful. The only thing I would say is that it does not much focus on the beauty that can be in the routine or mundane (referring to the line about the day to day). The pace is all wrong for that, as it zips through fairly active plotting. It's got everything else you mention in spades though. Even swashbuckling. Especially swashbuckling."
55485,"Pretty much every Gemmell book is like that in one way or another. Combat heavy though, doesn't have the whimsy of The Hobbit.  

R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt books exactly that, though again he excels at combat.  

_Spiderlight_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a modern take on a Gemmell-style adventure. (Bonus that it's stand alone)."
55486,"You know I've never heard of Gemmell before, thanks for that. Which of his books would you recommend first?"
55487,"The Drizzt books that /u/ketomatic mentioned are set in the D&D world, so if you enjoy stories from your friend, I bet you'd enjoy Salvatore's as well."
55488,"There's a few schools of thought, his publication order and chronological order are totally different. _Legend_ was his first book, and is a decent starting point. HOWEVER that is more of a defence than an adventure, though it is very good. Maybe _Morningstar_ or _Waylander_ might be more in-theme.  

My favorite is _Knights of Dark Renown_, which just happens to be the first book chronologically in that world. However it's really quite odd, though it is an adventure... I suppose."
55489,"The Furies of Calderon series is classic adventure fantasy. Jim Butcher wrote it as his homage to the swords and horses adventures he loved as a kid. The climaxes are awesome. I laughed, I cried, my mind was blown. Butcher is a master at building conflicts full of tension and surprise as well as crafting intense, realistic fight scenes. The magic system is solid here too."
55490,"I'd recommend anything by David Gemmel- Fantastic author- sadly no longer with us.  His books are some of my all time favorites.  I'd recommend starting with 3 waylander books but everything I have read of his is good.  I have yet to read any of his historical fiction however, but I have read most of his other books.

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/David_Gemmell#/works

I'd start with the Dreanai Saga, and go from there, Waylander and Skilganon the Damned are my favorite (Druss is great too)."
55491,"**Bridge of Birds** by Barry Hughart perhaps? It's pretty much an adventure story inspired by Chinese mythology, and a very light read."
55492,"[On Stranger Tides](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15670.On_Stranger_Tides) by Tim Powers: Adventure you say? Well here it is, swashbuckling, pirates, caribbean islands as setting, strange voodoo magic and mythology.   
  
If you don't mind science-fantasy mixed with some humor, check [The Witches of Karres](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317621.The_Witches_of_Karres) by James H. Schmitz. Non-stop adventure, cast of insane characters, weird magic, exotic locations, it's all there. It's an oldie (from the 60's) but definitely worth a read."
55493,Definitely the Riftwar Cycle series by Raymond E Feist! The world was originally created as an alternative to the D&D before being written into a book series and it's huge and fantastic.
55494,"I just finished *Inda* and have begun the second book (*Fox*?) by Sherwood Smith on the strength of several recommendations from this sub. It's adventure (low) fantasy though it may be more political than you're looking for. Caveat: I've spent about half my reading time infuriated at the number of names and titles each character has. But the swash and buckle have still sucked me into reading book 2 so it must be doing something right. 

I'd also suggest The Palace Job and its sequels for more of a high fantasy caper series, like a D&D Ocean's Eleven. 

(edit: bad grammar)"
55495,"Hey looks like you have a pretty long list already, but i have to add Michael Moorcock's Corum series and Elric of Melniboné series. All high fantasy adventure from the main protagonist viewpoint, swords and magic over politics and intrigue. And there's lots of em, they were written in the 60's through to 80's i think, so there can be a bit of a ""Flash Gordon"" kind of feel. Good entertainment though for sure."
55496,Check out [Forging Divinity](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24929067-forging-divinity). It's got pretty solid action and interesting magic. It's a quick read and not too dark.
55497,Hmm the earlier books of The Wheel Of Time Maybe??!
55498,"Curious, I've been interested in this series but always assumed it was mythology heavy?"
55499,It is but the first two or three books are travelling and fighting such.
55500,Is this a good thing? What are your thoughts on the series?
55501,Personally the series is one of my top favs. So
55502,"My latest discoveries in adventure fantasy are **The Copper Promise**, a rambunctious story featuring a group of mercenaries (the first book is episodic and stands alone. Complete series), **The Greatcoats**, starting with Traitor's Blade which is a swashbuckling series full of witty banter (ongoing series), and **Master of the Whitestorm**, a great sword&sorcery adventure with a psychological twist and a mysterious protagonist.

They are all adult fantasy titles full of action and travels, but there is also care on worldbuilding and character development."
55503,**The City Stained Red** by Sam Sykes! It honestly feels like a Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale game come to life in the form of a wickedly fun book.
55504,I just realized you didn't want multiple POVs. Whoops. I'll try to think of another.
55505,"Haha that's ok, I appreciate the recommendation and I'll have a look at it. I mean if it's a good book then I'm still interested. Let me know if you think of another one though!"
55506,I find that... difficult. I don't think I read many single POV books. It's not a very popular choice to make!
55751,"It looks like you're asking for recommendations. Please visit our [recommendation wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/recommendations) for tips that will help us to help you better!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Fantasy) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
55508,"I second Butcher's *Harry Dresden* series, super fun urban fantasy (don't let the writing in book one stop you, it gets exponentially better).  *His Dark Materials* trilogy by Pullman, *The Mists of Avalon* by Zimmer-Bradley are huge favorites.  While not strictly fantasy, I loved Anne Rice's *Witching Hour* trilogy too."
55509,"If you're looking for something a bit more high fantasy rather than urban, Butcher also wrote *Codex Alera*, whose first book is *Furies of Calderon*. I'm lead to understand that *Dresden* is more well-regarded in general (having not read it, I cannot compare the two), but I will say that while *Codex Alera* suffers a bit from predictability and a somewhat weak finale because of it, it is still a very good read with some solid story in it."
55510,"I actually tried that series.  It would have succumbed to my 40 page rule, but I really wanted to like it.  Still gave up after 100 pages.  Maybe I'll try again one day."
55511,"I gave up on the first Dresden book after about 100 pages myself.. personally, I wouldn't suggest any urban fantasy to OP since he seems to be looking for something more in the realm of high or dark fantasy."
55512,"Some good lighter novels that I liked were the Harry Dresden books, everything by Brent Weeks, and the October Daye series.

There are quite a few things that are like LoTR, including the Shannara series, but most of them are very predictable and follow a single high fantasy plot type.

As for heavier stuff, I'd recommend the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, or maybe even the Wheel of Time."
55513,"If you want to begin an epic adventure with a cast of great characters, I recommend the [Wheel of Time](http://www.dragonmount.com/Books/index.php) series.  If fourteen books seems a bit too much, perhaps you'd rather another trilogy, like the Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb, or Coldfire by C. S. Friedman. 

Shorter still, you could try a stand-alone book.  *Tigana* by Guy Gavriel Kay is amazing.  Or Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson which you can read for free on [his site](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/catalog/Warbreaker_Full-Books/).

Also, come over to /r/fantasy and we have a huge list of fantasy works in the sidebar."
55514,"Not personally a WoT fan, but both Tigana and Warbreaker were wonderful books.  
Brandon Sanderson is a fun read if you want magic systems that are a bit out of the ordinary, not QUITE as epic as LotR or WoT though."
55515,"Sanderson's Stormlight Archive promises to be pretty darn epic.  I've only read a bit of *Way of Kings*, but the whole saga is supposed to be ten books worth of epic high fantasy.  Could give WoT a run for its money."
55516,FINISH WAY OF KINGS RIGHT NOW!!! It's that good.
55517,OKAY I WILL ^later.
55518,"Oh, fair enough! It's like his only series I'm not following at the moment so it always slips my mind!"
55519,"Heh, yeah it's been sitting mockingly on my to-read stack for a while.  I feel like I need the right time to fully commit.  I'm also a bit wary of unfinished series, but Sanderson has such an incredible output speed, maybe it won't be an issue."
55520,"Definitely a bit more on the ball than... other authors.   
I'm still giving it a bit of a wait, just in case."
55521,"From most accounts WoT falls victim to some really boring, meandering entries later in the series..  I've read most of Sanderson's output and can tell you that it's all top notch stuff... I have every bit of faith in him to write 10 fantastic books (or tomes, TWoK is enormous)."
55522,"> From most accounts WoT falls victim to some really boring, meandering entries later in the series

Yeah, that's what people like to say, but I've never experienced it that way, and I've followed the series my whole life.  I feel like it's a nitpick that gained popularity as the series came to its widely publicized and anticipated finish, because people always have to find *some* nitpick with anything that becomes popular.

> I've read most of Sanderson's output

Ditto.  I'm a fan of his writing and of his teaching.  Right now I'm doing the online version of his writing class, ""Write About Dragons"".  He has an accessible approach to his process and offers some handy tools."
55523,"Loved the farseer trilogy, so different from what I expected :) has a very ""grown up"" feel."
55524,"You're the only person outside of my circle of friends that I've ever seen recommend GGK. By far my favourite author. Cheers, random internet person."
55525,"Try Kingkiller Chronicle.  Its a trilogy, only two are out right now.  I recently finished them.  I have to say that they are two of the most well-written books I've ever read.  I wholeheartedly suggest them to anyone.  Patrick Rothfuss is an excellent author.

The books are:  The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear.

There is a subreddit, [/r/kingkillerchronicle](http://www.reddit.com/r/kingkillerchronicle), I don't suggest you go there til you read them, though.

55526,just started Wise Mans Fear myself. loved The Name of the Wind and have recommended the books to many friends
55527,"I just started The Name of the Wind. I am not finding that Rothfuss is any special or spectacular at writing. I've only gotten to Chapter 6 and still unsure of whether or not I want to keep reading.

Do you have any advice or comments on this book to help me? My problems so far include the lack of description and characterization. First, I am not getting a clear picture of any setting the characters or in or what the characters look like. Second, whenever a man says anything in this book, it could be any of the people in the room talking until I read the name of the character who spoke it. There doesn't seem to be very much personality to any of them yet."
55528,"The first, in my opinion, starts off quite slow. I felt as if the story really kicked into gear about 1/3 of the way into the book. Just hang on. The series really is something else."
55529,"When I was reccommended this series by a friend I read the first chapter.  The next day I told him that it was the most boring book thing I've ever read.  A few weeks later I picked it up again and drug my feet through the first 8 or so chapters.  Then it hooked me.  I couldn't put it down after that.  If you're not hooked by chapter ~10... I don't know what to say.  Give it a little more.

The chapters are short enough that its not a pain to read like some other books.  Its easy to pick up and put down.  Once you get into it a bit more, you'll begin to realize the organic writing style that Rothfuss has.  Quite pleasant on the brain."
55530,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I read the name of the wind and thought it was extremely corny. I don't think I'm a book ""snob"" either."
55531,"Cool bonus: Apparently, this trilogy got picked up for a TV series.  Maybe it'll even be good!"
55532,I saw that.  I hope its good.  [But it was picked up by Fox...](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/07/patrick-rothfuss-name-of-the-wind-television-show)  We'll see how it goes.
55533,"A Song of Ice and Fire is pretty great. Epic plot, lots of characters, morally gray characters. Be warned, though, it's not complete and won't be for several years."
55534,hodor?!
55535,http://i.imgur.com/KlzqX.gif
55536,Haha! I feel like I could use this reaction on nearly every post I comment on. Oh GOT. I can't resent your ubiquity without becoming something I hate myself.
55537,'The Blade Itself'. It's part one of a truly epic trilogy by Joe Abercrombit. Do it
55538,I'm currently reading the last book now and i have to say they were an amazing read
55539,"Aye, i loved them. Logen Ninefingers is a legend of a character! I'd highly recommend the 3 stand alone books as well"
55540,"It's amazing, but also *dark*. Very different from Lord of the Rings in that regard. When I'd finished it I actually went out of my way to read something *happy* soon after. But then I'm a humongous wussie."
55541,Highly recommended!   I'm only in the middle of the trilogy but already know that this is one of the better fantasy series I've come across. The darker the better in my opinion.
55542,"I really didn't care for this series. Kind of self-important, *very*meandering, and while it dabbles with some incredibly cool ideas, it ultimately just kind of screws around and does nothing.  I gave the series up in the second book after West killed someone very unexpectedly (y'all should be able to guess, accurately, which character), and I found myself giving zero damns.

Seriously, when a character makes a completely transformative move after two books of development and you don't care, that's a clear sign that there's something significantly amiss with the books."
55543,Spoilers man! Spoilers!  .. I'm on the 2nd book myself.
55544,"Don't forget His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. None of the traditional fantasy tropes (the first one is a twelve year old girl riding an armored polar bear to the Arctic in a steampunk universe with her shape-shifting animal familiar) and it's aimed at teens and tweens so its a simple read, but it deals with some pretty heavy issues."
55545,"*Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell*, if you are looking for something different to green hills and orcs."
55546,"Standard advice on this one: if the first couple of chapters feel too dry and boring, *do not give up.* This is a book that gets ever so slightly more epic with each chapter, so the beginning is not representative of the awesome, world-shaking magical stuff that happens in the last third or so. It's a slow buildup, be patient.

The jokes, the characters, the style, and the worldbuilding are, by contrast, absolutely perfect, front to back."
55547,I couldn't get through the first fifty pages. It was just boring as hell.
55548,I read the whole thing. I'm still not convinced it was all that great.
55549,Same. I fucking hated it.
55550,Can't recommend this enough. My favorite book of all time.
55551,Yep.
55552,"I found this in the gutter when I was younger and ""rescued"" it to my bookshelf.  It's a bit smudged in places, but was still one of my better finds."
55553,"I'm not OP, but is there any chance you could describe it a bit?"
55554,"It's an alternative history book about what the world would look like if there was magic, more or less. It's set in 19th century England, and follows the lives of two magicians as they attempt to re-introduce magic into day-to-day society in England. As others have said, it's fantastic, you just have to make it through the first little bit first (which is somewhat dry) before you get to the really great stuff."
55555,That sounds right up my alley! Ill order a copy from amazon right now and pray the sellers post it soon.
55556,"Try the Malorean and Belgeriad sagas by David Eddings.  Also the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson,  and the Twelve Houses series by Sharon Shinn."
55557,"My English professor recently loaned me Gene Wolfe's *Book of The New Sun* tetralogy. I don't even *like* fantasy, and I loved them."
