3568,Just looking at photos and seeing if you like it
3569,"there are a ton of pre-created spreadsheets out there that can be used for researching colleges. they have a bunch of areas for things i hadn’t even thought of, so that helps a lot. just look up “college spreadsheets”. it helped me see the subtle differences between schools. also niche reviews and things like that"
3570,"Research faculty (some profs you like) and common data set. Also it's good to check out the overall ""feel"" of the campus/student body, for that I just used youtube."
3571,"The Hidden Ivies by Howard Greene has pretty good summaries of all the top schools, with info on school goals and advantages and standout majors/programs"
3572,The US govt college scorecard is a good source for lots of objective statistics
3573,"think of something specific you want to find first, then search ""\[thing\] \[college\]."" for example, i applied mostly as a chemistry major, so i googled ""chemistry undergraduate program \[college\]"" or something similar for each school. if i wanted to find interesting professors, i'd navigate first to the department i was interested in, then scroll through the faculty list. 

\^this kind of research i mainly used for ""why \[college\]"" essays. you'll want to name-drop a specific program or unique major they have and potentially a professor in your field (and why you're interested in their research/how that connects to your story). round out the essay with  fluffy talk about the school's atmosphere and the type of students it attracts. to get an understanding of a college's environment, student vlogs are super helpful. you can also try to analyze the way colleges market and advertise themselves to get an idea of how you want to make yourself come across. does their website feel more refined or welcoming? eccentric or straight laced? once you get a good feel for the type of person they want, you can shape your essays to better reflect that mold while still bringing your unique self to the table.

anyway, sorry this became essay advice lol. in general, it helps more to search for a specific thing on google with the title of the college rather than spend hours wading through confusing, non-user-friendly websites. good luck!"
3574,"Reddit, Niche, anywhere that students actually attending the universities (and not getting paid as tour guides) can give their anonymous opinions. If you have your heart set on a specific major, look for online rankings of how well each school you’re considering caters to that specific field of study. You’ll want the most resources and best environment possible"
3575,"YouTube, looking at Google images of the school/campus/area, reading through their subreddit, asking questions on their subreddit, etc. helps a lot. Also, googling “Is ____ university a good school?” will lead to Quora pages about the school and it will tell you a ton of info about whichever school you are looking in to. Once you find a quora post about your school, scroll down and find the “recommended/related posts” links and just keep finding questions/posts about your school. They typically have long answers and the recommended post links are really useful because they usually bring up different aspects of the school.

Note that Quora and college confidential posts can be quite outdated, but anything general (buildings, locations, vibes, facilities) written within 4-5 years usually remains the same.

Those “day in the life” vlogs with 1 million+ views can be an exaggerated view of the school and sometimes only highlight the benefits/positive aspects of the school. Try to find some honest and genuine people who make videos on the schools and have realistic views. People who mention the cons of a school are usually going to give you the best perspective.

Dorm move in videos can be decent at showing the campus and move in day, but a lot of people exaggerate the vlogs and have a fake personality. The videos with a chill person sitting in front of the camera and listing stuff about the school is usually going to be more real with you and generally have better info.

Good luck!"
3576,Thank you so much!!!
3577,"Definitely stuff like watching youtube vids and talking to students (see if the school offers informal interviews, webinars, etc etc), choosing based on ranks alone is really not it bc you can't write on your why x school essay something like 'oh you're number one in cs' and expect them to choose you for that reason. I also highly recommend just setting aside 2-3 hrs (and no more than that!!) to browse through a school's websites and identify cool programs, research, values, clubs that the school has, particularly anything unique to that school. that should give you a good idea of whether or not you want to go, and solid 'why x school' supp material if you do!"
3578,Thanks!!
3579,"I used CollegeBoard's college search thing. While it didn't really help me choose where to apply, it did help me choose my final choice. Fiske's guide is also a good source"
3580,"Many, many ways to go about this. I'll leave a few that worked for me:

* To ""find"" colleges: Just do a search by ranking/price/whatever matters to go. Look at system (quarter/semester), selectivity, demographics (girls:guys, girls in engineering, etc.), and setting (rural, any cities nearby).

* Don't consider any that are unaffordable. (Unless debt is unavoidable? Or you expect lots of aid/scholarships.)

* For safety, sports, trends: Search up the school. See what comes up: news, sports, problems with administration, admissions, research...

* For community: Go to their subreddit and any other student forums you can (like on Facebook, although they might be closed off to you). Follow them a bit to experience (a fraction of) the social scene.

* For school resources: Seeing if the school HAS something, like a health clinic, is different from knowing it's accessible enough. If those resources don't provide that information on their own sites I found the next best judgement to be Facebook pages for those where people leave reviews. Look at the comments and not the star rating.

* Ask questions to current students. Some schools have a team of students that field prospective student questions that you can ask about. They will be slightly biased.

* Touring the school is best, if possible. You'll see if you're comfortable with the campus' size, hills, buildings, colors, weather, number of people sleeping on the grass, and so on."
3581,"You can do a reverse chance me, where you basically put your preferences (size, location, academic strengths, etc) as well as your stats, and then people suggest colleges that you have a chance at getting into that you might like."
3582,Buy a Fiske guide to colleges.  It's the best starting point.
3583,"cappex, collegeboard, ed navigator"
3584,"Niche.com for starters. I just went through this with my daughter and something we would have done differently is to look at the actual courses your degree would require, if you know your major. So many programs vary wildly in their requirements. She would have ended up at the school she chose anyway, but it would have changed the other schools she applied to."
3585,"Usually I start out with niche \(lol\), just to get some overall insight into a college I've found. They have some nice lists you can spin off from, and it's a really great tool for college explorations. You don't want to depend on any single site for all your info though. The reviews are pretty good too\- usually I'll start with the one stars and work my way up on different aspects. 

It's a little off the side, but I also like going on college admissions/specific college discords and just hitting ctrl\-f for certain keywords to see what other people think about certain colleges or majors. You'll get more thoughtful and research insights you won't be able to find online, although on chats like those you do want to take everything in with a grain of salt.

It's also easier to ask questions and get into contact with people at a certain college."
3586,"The labels come from the Carnegie Classifications (from the Carnegie Foundation): 

http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/

In the past few years, however, most of the classifications have been renamed. For example, R1 is now ""RU/VH: Research Universities (very high research activity)"".

http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/summary/basic.php"
3587,"This is exactly right. The library/journal association stuff is just correlation, but this is the group that originally used the R1 label."
3588,"I use the [AAU (American Association of Universities) membership](http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476) as a better proxy of what R1 used to mean. It's basically a subset of the RU/VH classification, and exclude some less research-reputable school."
3589,Thanks. I had wondered about this.
3590,"Check out this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_I_university) from Wikipedia. It is a separate classification system than the one that US News has. 

I heard of additional criteria of becoming an R1 school, such as being a member of the [Association of Research Libraries](http://www.arl.org/about). If you look on the list of libraries, it is likely that the school is also R1. This website is also really great because you can look up statistics about the schools related to their libraries. For example, how many journal subscriptions they maintain and such. It is important to consider this because it means the more subscriptions they have, the less likely it is that you have to pay for an article or subscription on your own.

Other characteristics of an R1 school include accessibility of research opportunities to undergraduate students.

I haven't heard of any category less than R1, although that isn't to say that it doesn't exist."
3591,The libraries comment is a good point. Thanks. I've heard that an R1 school may do multiple 100's of millions of dollars in research where an R2 may do 100 million or less in research.
3592,"I think what is maybe a bit more useful is looking at rankings of the specific departments relevant to your field. Both US News and the Chronicle do that. I've found from interviewing before my Master's that professors are definitely aware of those rankings.

[example for ecology and evolution](http://chronicle.com/article/NRC-Rankings-Overview-Ecology/124723/)"
3593,Nothing is official.  There are at least 50-60 top 10 R1 schools if you count everything different people label that way.
3594,"That is the impression that I have gleaned, which is why I was trying to clarify. I wonder if any schools have moved up or down in the tiers?"
3595,"If the words are ambiguous and the implications vague, then mobility isn't even on the radar of validity."
3596,You know R1's when you see 'em.
3597,"This may be completely wrong, since when I had this question last year I had significant trouble finding a definitive answer, but I think another thing that matters in distinguishing between R1/R2/SLAC is the amount of teaching that professors are expected to do. At an R1 school teaching is relatively low priority, while at SLAC (selective liberal arts consortium) teachers have a much larger course load. R2 falls somewhere in between; they are expected to keep an active lab but may also teach a few classes per semester."
3598,"""slac"" is small liberal arts college I think."
3599,[Seventh one down.](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/SLAC)
3600,[multiple meanings](http://www.acronymfinder.com/SLAC.html) I guess (bottom one).
3601,I think that's likely the consequence of an R1 rather than the diagnostic tool for one. I might be wrong though.
3602,"Yeah, I think you're right, I was just saying that if you're trying to determine what tier a school is, emphasis on teaching is a good indicator."
3603,R1 schools have PhD programs.
3604,"I did my undergrad at the U of South Dakota. It's a good school with a PhD program in many subjects, but far from a D1 school."
3605,I'd say it is R1 for those subjects then. R1 != prestigious school.
3606,"Look at factors like graduation rate, retention rate, ROI, salary after graduation. I think those will indicate the quality of a school/program without having to look at rankings."
3607,"Put away the rankings books. If you can afford it, invest in these books or look for them in a library. Or look for their websites. 
The Fiske Guide. 
Colleges that change lives.  
Where you go is not who you are by frank Bruno. 
The Insiders Guide  to Colleges by Yale daily news. 
The College Finder by Steve Antonoff. 
The Hidden Ivies by Howard Green. 

These are my favorite books. I also like Princeton reviews top 371 book."
3608,niche gives lots of student reviews and rankings by major that are somewhat valid
3609,I really liked college board's big future search option. It's a wonderful starting point and you can see the different options that are a good fit to you
3610,"Good on you for being open to other majors and realizing that rankings aren't everything :)

Unigo and Niche have great sections that are ""student reviews"" of the college. I liked reading them to get a sense of what it was like to be on campus. **Definitely** check these out.

Similarly, admissions blogs are very helpful for this--MIT was the pioneer for these and IMO, have the best ones :P http://mitadmissions.org/blogs

College Scorecard is a great place to get baseline info about a college. Same with eh Common Data Sheets.

College Websites! Bruh, literally just going onto the college website and looking at their mission statement, the criteria that they like to apply when selecting students, what they look for, etc., really helped me understand what kind of students are going to be at that schools :P

USNWR, but SOLELY to help me find colleges to research. I basically just looked up top 100 schools at ____, read through the list, noted down the ones that I was remotely interested in, and then just kept narrowing it down by doing more and more research. I agree with you--these ranking basically mean jack shit for undergrad, especially if you want high teaching quality. But, they're a good place to *Start*, but not beyond that. If you're intersted in multiple majors and have any idea about which other ones you might be interested in, see if there's overlap between these rankings for those majors :P

And finally, weirdly, their meme pages. They give you a very interesting insight into the personality of the students."

3613,Is there a particular reason that France seems to have a significantly lower density of top 1000 universities than its neighbors?
3614,"I think its because of the density of the Universities. As far as i am aware most of the highly ranked Unis are in Paris, which this plot doesn't show too well"
3615,The plot points seem to be off in this. Pretty distant from the actual location
3616,"A lot of French universities have research institutes next to them which may share staff with them but are not technically a part of the university, hence their research does not count as coming from the university."
3617,This should be included though as German universities also operate by that principle.
3618,"30% of France lives in Paris, so all their best schools are also on top of each other and are shown with only one dot. A heatmap would have been better I imagine."
3619,"Population of France: 67 millions.
Population of Paris: 2 millions. It grows to 12 millions if you add the whole urban area.

No matter how you do it, it cannot be 30%."
3620,Sorry it's 20%. That's still a crazy high number.
3621,"This map is based on research, in france most of it is done by separate public  agencies and not in the universities"
3622,"Same might be true for Argentina that somebody mentioned in another comment. Most research comes from CONICET, a state entity."
3623,"Many universities are in Paris and hence are not very visible on this map. Also, many of the top French students don’t go to university but to highly selective and smaller schools (Grandes Écoles). Although I don’t know how much this latter point matters since I believe that most research in France is still conducted within universities."
3624,"Also, there's a language issue. I did research in France, and there is a cultural preference to publish in French in many circles (or a resistance to publish in English, the result is the same) which limits exposure to the rest of the world which mostly publishes/reads in English in academia. This can reduce the impact factor rankings of French research, and correspondingly downgrade the perceived research quality of French universities, which are actually excellent schools in general for both teaching and knowledge output."
3625,"France has a slightly different system in that the top schools are not actually universities, but *grandes écoles* eg. École Centrale, écoles des mines, supélec, école normale supérieure etc..

So the top schools may not actually be in this map. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_écoles"
3626,Author says they are included.
3627,What's in the middle of Argentina?
3628,"Cordoba, a city of 1.391 million"
3629,"Wait, isn’t UBA a world’s top 1000 university?"
3631,"There are many of these indexes. This one in particular seems to be sponsored by Elsevier and the map is based only on the 'Research' aspect. The website is not very clear, but the ranking criteria seems to be published papers per professor. This is not about teaching.

Anyway, I was really surprised to find UNC in that map. Some local newspaper will surely make a huge story about this."
3632,"Assuming you mean UNC chapel hill, why is that surprising? It’s a top 5 public school in the US"
3633,National University of Cordoba
3634,Oh hahaha
3635,Number of papers published could be pretty deceptive. Weighting the papers by impact factor would be one step closer.
3636,It only educates half the doctors in  south america.
3637,"You are counting how many students get into the career or how many finish it??? Because they have something like 2000 people on its 1st year but by the second it may just be 500. 

Anyone can enter med school there. Not to many finish it. 

Not saying it is a bad thing btw, it gives a chance to many people."
3638,How many nationalities is uba teaching
3639,"Anybody can sign up for free, you don't need to be an Argentinean citizen, so it's hard to tell."
3640,This is by research not teaching outcome.  A major med school doesn’t necessarily mean a big research population.
3641,I guess it should be!
3642,"Yeap. The data this map uses is kinda fishy if the UNC appears but the UBA doesn't. Furthermore, the Balseiro should be there. There's nothing like the Balseiro in LATAM. It's the mini MIT of Argentina."
3643,You mean nothing like ITA or IME in Brazil?
3644,The balseiro is in another completely different category
3645,"The thing is, should I choose staying in UBA or going to Balseiro if like more theoretical physics?"
3646,"Balseiro hands down.

But you should have a solid foundation already. The entry exam is brutal."
3647,"The Harvard of Canada eh? If you're the something of something, you really aren't the anything of anything."
3648,"Balseiro is the too notch university for highly speciañiced engineer, to enter you must have done at least 2 years of ingeneering education on another univercity, and then pass a hard af test, and then they interview you, the good thing is that if you are in they cover all your living expenses"
3649,Apparently not according to research scoring. But probably yes according to other things.
3650,Go UNC!
3651,Go DUKE!
3652,More Argentina.
3653,"> Oh good, my universities are on there.

--Anyone from the UK



It's kind of interesting at a glance, but on closer inspection I don't think much information can be gleaned from this beyond broad generalisations, e.g. Africa is worse off than Europe."
3654,"> Oh good, my universities are on there.

—Anyone from Finland"
3655,seems like almost all the major canadian universities are on there too. and pretty much all the ontario based ones are there
3656,Super easy to spot your school if it's out west too.
3657,New Zealand calling: six out of eight Universities represented!
3658,"All 8 if you look closely, zoom in and Chch definitely has 2, think Auckland does also"
3659,">All 8 if you look closely, zoom in...

Your zoom prowess exceeds mine!  That is even better news."
3660,"As an American, I too am happy to see mine on the map. :D"
3661,Or East Coast of the US.
3662,- anyone from NZ
3663,"Am I the only one missing a legend? There should be some sort of readability minimum in this subtree. Otherwise it is just clunky charts.

The chart is nice but one doesn't know about the different colors"
3664,"There’s no need for a legend, the dots are all the same and semi transparent and overlapping dots look red."
3665,The dots come in varying sizes.
3666,"It would be nice if universities that were 0-100, 100-200, 200-300... etc were marked with different colors"
3667,"Not really, a lot of them are located in the same city/small pocket so the colors would overlap like crazy. That'd probably look terrible."
3668,"The dots definitely aren’t all the same size, and they’re also different shades of red and orange."
3669,Begging for a heat-map.
3670,"This is silly. For Europe, it mostly shows how centralized a country is. Take France, all of its top universities are in Paris (many of them), so only one dot is visible there. They're all small universities too (as compared to American ones), so you end up with several medium-sized dots on top of each other. Take Italy or Germany that have lots of medium-size cities of equal power with a a good/decent university in each, and you end up with tons of orange all across the place. Even though France's research output is between Italy's and Germany's.

You end up with a population map, with a very visible [blue banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana)."
3671,"It's impossible to tell whether both Harvard and MIT are on here, seeing as they're only a few miles apart.

Top 100, possibly all labeled, might have been more interesting"
3672,"The problem with doing only a top 100 listing is that it would be even more affected by the exact methodology used to generate the list. 

And the methodology for university listings is always more than questionable. For instance most listings based on university reputation say more about the university's position in previous rankings (favoring mostly us and UK universities) or about how impressive a university's name is (favoring ""University of [country name]"" and ""University of [capital city]"") than about the actual quality of the university. 

But including the top 1000 you can at least reduce this to the point where you can say that the list includes a reasonable fraction of all top universities in the world, without having to go into too much detail about whether ""university of A"" is better than ""B university""."
3673,You make good points. I think we need a map with at least 10x higher resolution. My problem is that it's too cluttered.
3674,"Totally agree. What *useful* information does this provide? That there are blobs of great universities on America's east and west coasts? There's a bunch in England? Without at least a list beside it, or some interactivity, or a zoom feature, it's just a bunch of dots."
3675,"Not sure if this is useful but I did learn there was some decent universities in some interesting places such as Peru, Uganda, Kenya, and Gran Canaria to name few."
3676,Probably safe to assume that they are both in the top 1000
3677,That's why mae3780 chose those institutions.
3678,Probably safe to assume that they are both in the top 10
3680,Where do you see BC as being that low? I’ve always seen it as a bit better than BU
3681,https://xkcd.com/1138/
3682,So so good.
3683,Always relevant
3684,Damn. You beat me to it
3685,"And that Paris dot is lots of smaller institutions \(ESPCI, ENS, Polytechnique...\) stacked on top of each other. If they were combined, they'd get a huge single blob, more like MIT or Imperial college"
3686,"Ah yes, the blue banana. The least appetizing of bananas."
3687,Goes well with muffins.
3688,Or waffles
3689,oh god no
3690,"The blue banana just looks like it follows the path of the Thames and the Rhine, which makes sense."
3691,Plus the Po Valley.
3692,"Not always true look at the England 20% of the population is in London. England is practically 100% covered, remember the two best university’s are in small cities with less than half a percent of the population."
3693,"For France another important point was not mentioned earlier:
A lot of universities, graduate school or research institues have multiples campus with one official administrative headquarter in Paris. Some institutes ares ""network"" of universities. The heading of a french research paper could be really misleading regarding where the research took place. The actual name and place of the lab could be in the third or fourth position.  

For example, for my master thesis, the first name was Paristech, it is a network Parisian engineering school (Only one of them still have a campus inside Paris), the second name was the Paris head quarter of the school, third the name was the industrial partner, and fourth was the actual lab at a campus in the east of France.

The same happen in all field (CNRS, INRIA, EHESS).

This is done on propose. The small institutions could not get international visibility without regrouping. So now every institution in part of a network, federation, mother institution with a fancy Parisian adresse and all research seem to come from Paris."
3694,"It's a tough thing to visualise, if you think about it.

Sure, there are problems with this current viz, as you stated, but I can't think of any other method to present this data in a way which retains its realism.

Sure, you could do some kind ""top 1000 universities as a proportion of population"", or some kind of hexagonal grid like ""top 1000 universities per n km"", or give each orange dot its own space so that none overlap...

...but I think it would become completely abstracted to the point of unreadability.

In truth, it's the 'fault' of reality that the top 1000 universities *just are* in the most developed urban centers, not the fault of this viz."
3695,france has also a system of schools beside universities (napoleon legacy)
3696,"And Germany does a lot of research outside of universities (Fraunhofer, Planck, Helmholtz, Leibniz etc.), hence both countries don't perform good on those ""how British is your university""-rankings."
3697,"Yeah of course I'm including grandes écoles when I say ""universities""."
3698,"In Germany, in addition, most top level research takes place in ""institutes"" (Max Planck, Fraunhofer), so there massive research contributions don't count for any university based statistics."
3699,"Just wanted to throw in that the validity of these indicators is highly debated. From an epistemological, pedagogical and sociology-of-science point of view, there probably shouldn't be list of ""Top 1000"" universites as such a compilation loses a lot of meaning through oversimplification.


EDIT: There seems to be a bit of misunderstanding going on. What I meant was that filtering for certain criteria like ""best ranked in *teaching* medicine or in chemistry *research*"" should make the ranking a bit more meaningful. HOWEVER: I just tested the 2018 results for ""history, philosophy, theology"", disciplines where continental European universities are traditionally quite strong in research output as well as in teaching. Funnily they are being overtaken by many tech-focused institutions (some of which already have a lower quantitative output of publications when compared to the larger European unis). Just look for yourself at wich rank finally the first European uni appears: https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/100/subjects/3102/sort_by/scores_research/sort_order/asc/cols/scores

One reason for this might be that these rankings exclude German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch.. publications right from the start. 

TL;DR: my confidence in these results has dropped another couple of notches."
3700,My university is not there so I trust the list.
3701,"While I agree with you in general, there are some pretty solid indicators for research scores that allow for a relatively unbiased view.

Although good for nothing else, this map shows how far the integration of non English speaking countries into the Anglo-Saxon academic world has come if only because these locations are included in this list.

The problem is that governing bodies of universities seem to make those rankings their top priorities.

Although academic competition is not necessarily a bad thing... I'm torn."
3702,"An anecdote from Germany:

Here research and teaching is somewhat separated, with Universities being mainly for teaching students and other institutions doing the main part of actual innovation. So Universities in Germany are at a disadvantage when listed in such rankings. Even though they might be better suited for many students, because teaching is more important for those Universities than pumping out papers."
3703,"I mean it's research score, not quality of education score."
3704,"The researchers are often university professors/lecturers, same as in the US. But in the US the university gets research grants and the researchers attribute their university in academic papers - while in Germany the institute (Max Planck Institute of XYZ) gets the grants and gets attributed in the research papers."
3705,These rankings are used by future students as reviews on where to enrol. And therefore this whole ranking business is kind of false advertising and pretty much meaningless.
3706,"Welcome to literally every league table since the dawn of time; a semi random, completely politicised process designed to mislead future minds.

My school actively discourage parents from paying attention to them, even though we are one of the top departments in the UK."
3707,"The exact opposite is true here in Singapore. The government wanted to boost their ranking they essentially funding a lot of research, many pointless, through the universities. This boosted their rankings and got more foreigners to enrol. 

I think our Mechnical Engineering is like 3rd best in the world. Did not feel that way when I was there. Place had a lot of professors who taught only because they had to, and exams were ripped off from previous years."
3708,"This illustrates one of the many complex variables; what you say is true to an extent for the natural sciences, but not for the humanities."
3709,"> but not for the humanities.

that depends. there are disciplines within the humanities that aren't even taught outside of applied sciences universities (like social work studies). The reality is a bit too complex to map it onto these simple ranking algorithms."
3710,"Universities of Applied Sciences (= the former FHs in Germany) are a thing in Scandinavia and other countries, too. This is why indicators for learning experience and research output shouldn't be easily mixed as it is done in these rankings."
3711,"That's largely true in the US as well, although not to the same extent. But we definitely have ""teaching"" and ""research"" universities. While both types both teach and do research, they have very different emphases and expectations for faculty members. Most of the American universities you would have heard of are classified as research institutions."
3712,"> there are some pretty solid indicators for research scores that allow for a relatively unbiased view.

my point was that they have to be adapted to context. Calculating the arithmetic mean across these different contexts makes it much less meaningful. 

> Although good for nothing else, this map shows how far the integration of non English speaking countries into the Anglo-Saxon academic world has come if only because these locations are included in this list.

Sorry, but not really. As somebody working at one of the ""top"" universities in Germany, the overall ""anglo-saxon first"" bias of these kinds of studies hasn't changed much (and your comment kind of confirms this, too, because your implicit premise seems to be that ""integration into the Anglo-Saxon academic world"" equals ""progress""). 

> The problem is that governing bodies of universities seem to make those rankings their top priorities.

Here I agree with you completely. These kinds of metrics, similar to impact scores or altmetric scores are hurting the overall enterprise of research as such. A lot of the most valuable aspects a place has for research and scholarship might not be quantifiable at all. 

> Although academic competition is not necessarily a bad thing... 

In the current climate I would argue that the drawbacks outweigh the positives by far. The current publish-or-perish way of doing things gives rise to predatory journals, to plagiarism, to things like p-hacking... I would give grants out to people for not publishing anything for three years but to come up with something truly new, regardless of the impact it makes. The idea of innovation and courage is deeply missing from academia as everybody is forced to play it as safe as possible with just another rehash and paraphrasing of stuff that has already been done."
3713,"I appreciate your answer and find only little to discuss.

Publish or perish is a problem, absolutely. But I would not ascribe the perceived lack of courage or innovation to a systemic problem of academia but merely to the survivorship bias. Innovation is only really distinguishable in hindsight. Besides that, there are parts of academia that need less innovation and more validation."
3714,"I agree completely.  And regarding your last sentence: this is the other side of the same coin. ""Boring"" or tedious validation is hardly being rewarded, similar to more ""far out"" ideas, regardless whether or not they prove to be innovative in hindsight. In this respect, academic competition means getting ahead WITHIN the mainstream consensus view - mainly by not questioning it too much. And while not without its merits, I feel that this model produces a lot of unintended consequences. I would love to do a 10 year experiment of scientific micro-environments in which these classic notions of competition are suspended."
3715,"Yes, that would be great."
3716,Really enjoyed this discourse. Nicely done /u/smallquestionmark & /u/theologi.
3717,it was really  u/smallquestionmark 's discourse skills all the way.. :)
3718,You are very charitable.
3719,Publish or perish at the expense of the students paying money for an education they won't receive is the true problem.
3720,"This mostly applies to countries where higher education isn't state sponsored, so, mainly to the US, UK, and many Asian and commonwealth countries.

But the general gist of your criticism would be that quality of teaching and quantity/quality of published output have little to do with each other, a point I would very much agree with. There are a lot of Unis not on these lists that probably provide a better learning experience for students than those higher ranked."
3721,"I think that it is systemic. Taking time to make breakthroughs and validation get little or no encouragement, whereas highly trumpeted micro\-innovations get the bulk of the funds."
3722,"To your last point- while I agree that innovation and creativity drives our respective fields forward.. I would argue in the experience of my field there is another consideration. Reviewers tend to ONLY accept new research. If it is not ""novel"" enough it is rejected. Repeatability is a cornerstone of scientific progress so that trend irks me to a degree. 

So what you end up with is people trying to find the new niche and forgetting about some of the core concepts."
3723,"I agree and I mentioned this in another comment: the lack of reward for verification, reproduction, cross-checking and so on is the other side of the same coin. 

I guess it depends on the specific discipline, but I get the feeling that a lot of reviewers want something to be ""new"" only insofar as it stays well within the established paradigms. *really* new approaches often get buried pretty quickly. 

And there are whole disciplines where the epistemological foundations are more than shaking. Heck, within economics, for instance, some rebels had to found the movement of ""pluralist economics"" whose core demand is that economics doesn't style itself as a natural science with monocultural methods as the past 150 years have shown time an again that this doesn't really to the everday reality of markets. The groupthink can get pretty bad."
3725,I was never able to trust the Guardian's ranking simply because it jumped so much from year to year. I always preferred the Times'.
3726,"I definitely used the guardian ranking as well as the times' when I was picking unis - and as you'd say, the filter by subject can be a very useful feature.
I would say though that having read through the Times website linked by OP, it seems like the Times are using most, if not all, the criteria you have listed. 
I think that means the main difference here is that the guardian ranking is a student satisfaction/experience/ teaching ranking, where the Times is more focussed on research.
Also, I can only imagine trying to accurately compare internationally must be more difficult than comparisons for a single country where the education system, class sizes, finances etc etc are at least broadly similar."
3727,"It might be different in the UK and elsewhere, but one of the problems with academic rankings in the US is that a large portion of the data that's used to create the rankings are provided by the institutions themselves. This allows them to omit some statistics, embellish others, and also generally introduces variability due to how different institutions answer the same question. For example, for faculty:student ratio, different universities will count faculty in different ways. Do you count the medical staff at the university-run hospital? Some do, some don't. These days I think most do, because they're aware of how the system works and how to game it, but counting personnel like that makes for a metric that doesn't mean the same thing for every institution.

TL;DR In large part I think school rankings are very course-grained. In the US, at least, the top 10-20 schools generally or in a particular category probably belong there, and the top 100 schools probably belong in that range, too. But the differences between the 2nd and the 5th or the 32nd and the 47th are not likely of any significance, at least not as measured by the rankings."
3728,"Definitely true. Rankings of universties are very flawed for many reasons. But, because 'top 1000' universities is such a broad category, I think it accurately displays where the world's best universities are roughly located. E.g. because American universities often score higher than they should, a European university might come in lower but it's still gonna make the top 1000 of course! Then again, it was of course to be expected that this was the U.S.A., western Europe and China."
3729,What is your evidence for US universities scoring higher than they should? Wishful thinking?
3730,"This is fun to watch for a minute but a lack of legend/information and scale (Paris, as someone said), makes it not very useful overall. 

You could rename it ""Dots where universities exist""."
3731,"Dude, nice idea, but your data is kinda funny. Im latinamerican and I can tell you that at least Argentina, Chile and Peru look weird. If U Antofagasta (I guess) is there, at least UBA and Catholic University of Peru should also be there."
3732,"This index is based on reasearch scores. I suppose that the chilean universities focuse more on the reasearch work than in the education, that´s why they are so overrepresented. UBA it´s for sure a top 3 university in LATAM, but the research work over there isn´t the greatest, because most of the public reasearch in Argentina it´s carried out by the CONICET, and the pubic universities focus on the educational prospect.

I´m not informed about the peruvian sistem of universities, but if i had to guess, i suppose the same is happening over there.

In conclussion it´s a nice index to meassure reasearch works, but it´s not so good at the time of meassuring which are actually the best universities around the world (developing an index to measure a concept so abstract as what makes a University better than others it´s not a easy task)."
3733,I should start a subreddit to comment everytime I see a map that completely butchers what michigan looks like. Like wtf how is that even close?

3736,"A place that's good at research is not necessarily good at teaching.

If the goal is to figure out the best place to attend as a student, it's like picking the best place to work based on stock market performance."
3737,A place that's high on research isn't necessarily good a research either. They base this on publications and citations. Some places just crank out garbage or semi-garbage publications that no one ever cites to game the rankings.
3738,"Isn't uncited stuff zero\-valued in this? What are you on about \- is garbage doens't get cited, nothing on this map is boosted."
3739,"Nah, some do each separately and then add them up to generate a research score. Heavily cited stuff is awesome, but garbage is also counted."

3749,"The rankings for US versus World confused me; why are some that are high on the US rankings much lower on the World ones(like, beaten out by lower ranked US ones)???"
3750,"From the site:
The entirely student-focused nature of the WSJ/THE US College Rankings means that the results differ significantly from the THE World University Rankings, which have a heavier emphasis on research excellence on a global scale.

My understanding from working in higher education is that in this case the US ranking focuses primarily on student experience / teaching quality, where the world university rankings focus more on research.

3758,How is the score related to the size? Do you do logarithms or surface area of the circle?
3759,"I think results based on research score really only tell half the tale of a university's ranking. I can see my university there. If results were published based off some metric concerning undergraduate performance, it wouldn't even come close. 

The facilities for undergraduate engineers is quite abysmal - the primary concern is for the college to push you through the assembly line as fast as possible over 4 years and try to scare you into taking a post-grad by not allowing you to become a chartered engineer with our national governing engineering body with just a B.A. - thus bolstering their research numbers. The standard of teaching skill among lecturers is awful. Very few with teaching qualifications, just incredibly intelligent people doing research forced into lecturing as a part of their contract/bit of money on the side. There's really no effort put into cultivating an atmosphere of learning and curiousity.

3760,"Couldn’t agree more. University rankings based on research tell you nothing about the undergraduate learning experience. And unfortunately, many students and families base their decision off of these rankings."

3772,"Aussie here. I work with lots of Indians and get along with them a lot, they often joke and say I'm a white-born Indian and various other things, all in fun.

Anyway, I was talking with one about university degrees and he was going on about how he went to one of the best universities in the world and India has the best universities in the world.

I've found some Indians (not all) even though they have moved to a foreign country with a foreign language because **they know** they're far better off here than back home will still talk about their homeland like it's the best place in the universe.

Anyway, I challenged him on it and said the university I went to is definitely in the top 1000 in the world, and I asked if his was and he said ""Yes it will be top 10!""

In 2018 mine is at #80 and his is still not mentioned."
3773,"If your friend is from the IITs or IISc, Bangalore, then he really may have a point. They're not in the ""top 10"" but are ranked quite high. This dude kvothe5688 has no idea what he's talking about. He's one of those all-too-common self-hating Indians who bitch about their country with absolutely unsubstantiated claims to sound cool. Pretty sure university ranking organisations have a much better idea than him about spotting ""fake research"", when they chose to rank 30 Indian universities in the top 1000."
3774,"What an ass. There's always that one self-hating Indian on every thread that comes up with unsubstantiated claims to put down the efforts and progress of others. ""unprecedented level"", ""masters at stealing western research""... wow. Stop demeaning the country just because you went to some low-tier college/university where such stuff happens."
3775,"Some Indians just love to bitch about themselves, even when there is evidence to the contrary like in this case. No matter how much progress occurs, these people will keep talking trash to get approval. I'm pretty sure the university ranking groups have a much better way of recognizing whether a university's research is ""fake research"" or not than you do. Grow up."
3776,"How ridiculously skeptical. Don't demean the work and effort of others if you don't have substantial evidence to support your claims. The IITs and IISc, Bangalore have been constantly ranking high in the QS Top Universities lists, and have a lot of great genuine research under their belt. So do many other Indian universities. And I'm pretty sure University ranking organizations can spot ""fake research"" better than most people do."
3777,"Do you have any idea of what you're even talking about? Don't just spew shit to sound cool on a social media site. There are thousands of people in India who forgo careers in high paying jobs in order to perform research in science and engineering. A portion of them may be making minor improvements to existing ideas but that doesn't mean that they(much less all of us) are ""stealing western research"". Grow the fuck up dude
E: All that said, I AM a but surprised to see so many Indian institutes on the map. I expected only a handful because research costs money, which is hard to come by in India. There are very few well funded universities in India but they're top notch in research when it comes to certain fields."

3819,I was recently told that Arizona State University has a wonderful online program
3820,"Make sure the school is regionally (not nationally) accredited. It should say on the website, but if you're not sure, call an admissions rep and just ask them outright. Usually there will be a community college in your area that offers most of its classes online - start there. It will be much cheaper than a for-profit like Devry and the like."
3821,A lot of regular colleges offer online programs. If you find the right school you might even be able to do the first year online and then change to on-campus without changing schools.
3822,I was thinking about just going into my community college but they don't offer a degree in anything I want. I'm already getting pretty old and want to settle into a career now or I'm afraid I'll be 40 one day and be in the same exact spot I'm in now.
3823,Try looking around websites of smaller public colleges. A lot of them offer fairly inexpensive online degrees in different fields. It doesn't even have to be colleges close to you. They will usually let you do in-person exams at proctoring centers near you so you don't have to travel.
3824,"Stay away from DeVry (unless someone else is paying the bill) and University of Phoenix.  Way over priced.

Look into Western Governers Univeristy (WGU) and SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University)-they have wonderful online degree options.

Ohio state and Temple University also have some great online degrees/classes.  Far more legit than DeVry."
3825,I am curious does OSU list on the degree if its online. Usually they do this by listing a campus or something that does not physically exist.

3828,"What type of program are you interested I? A lot of state schools are offering online programs at a reasonable cost and there are also other regionally accredited, non-profit options."
3829,Was wanting to go into business management or something stem related.
3830,There are many more liberal arts and biz degrees online than stem. Only a hand full of universities offer stem online with the correct accreditation. For engineers the program needs I believe its called ABIET credited or maybe its ABET. Can't remember but without this its trash.
3831,"100% agree. There are many online business degrees offered by all sorts of schools. Donny is correct, it's hard to find online STEM programs ABET accredited."
3832,What state? Try searching for “(your state) distance education” to find regular universities with online degree programs.
3833,Would I still have to take an entrance exam in person?
3834,"Depends on the institution. Have you taken the SAT or ACT? You may need to take these exams. However, these exams are given all over the country and you can just go to the testing location closest to you. Seriously, you shouldn’t consider a school that has no admissions requirements (and even DeVry requires SAT/ACT scores)."
3835,"Naw, I dropped out and I have take administration tests in the past where they said I wouldn't need any English/Math classes I just never went further in the process."
3836,"There are tons of State Universities that offer almost all online courses or 100% online to complete a degree. The one thing you need to be careful of is that although it will not say on your degree you were an online student it will sometimes list a campus or college that has no physical presence. That is how an employer will be able to tell you did online.

That being said there are colleges where they will simply list the college campus or college on the degree that has a physical presence. With those no one can tell you are online only. I just say this if this is something you care about because online does have a stigma about it.

Here are some colleges I can think off the top of my head that are legit state online colleges that have a physical location and are well known.

Colorado State University
Missouri State Online
Penn State Online 
Arizona State 
Thomas Edison University

Those are just off the top of my head. One thing to remember is that some universities do not advertise being online only but you can usually get 90% of your degree online. For example I know a university that requires you to take 12 credits in person and you can take the rest online."
3837,UMUC is good and regionally accredited. Made for the military post ww2 and is the biggest online college today
3838,ASU
3839,"As someone who used to work for two For Profit online education companies, I would encourage you to go with the distance learning branch of a traditional Non-Profit university.  The For Profits are just out for a buck and often you leave ill-equipped for an actual career.  This is especially true in fields that require licensure, such as teaching or Psychology.  Also, if the hiring manager has had a bad experience with someone from that online school, exactly because they are ill-equipped, they're going to judge everyone else from that school with the same lens. This can be true of Brick and Mortar institutions as well, but usually then there are enough people from that particular school in an area to even out the reputation a bit.  But I'd definitely recommend staying away from For Profit education if at all possible."
3840,"Is there a list of for-profit and non-profit universities somewhere?  I attend school online (regionally accredited, my program is accredited and upon graduation I qualify for licensure) and I worry about being scammed or looked down upon by future employers despite my university's accreditation.

3847,That's fucked up.
3849,Well shit that sucks.
3850,Yeah it's too bad you fell into that scam.  Best way to recover it is to find an entry lvl job and move your way up the experience pole.
3851,"Disqualified you because you earned it online, right?"
3853,"That assumes you take college classes to solely get the stamp on your resume and not care about how well it benefits you on an intellectual level, as the post asks how it works out for you.  
  
I took one of my grad classes online and while I enjoyed the class, the format allowed me to slack off.  I noticed that as long as I clicked on other people comments (even if only looking at them for 1 second each) it showed that I was active and participating in all the discussions.  
  
College as well as any education or experience in life is what you make of it. When employers decide you are a good or bad prospective employee solely based on your education ""stamp"" on your resume it makes my eyes roll."
3854,I'm taking the majority of my classes online this semester. I also took an online class over the summer. It absolutely depends on how the class is set up and the professor along with software that they may incorporate.
3856,"A lot of people go to school to learn, not just to get the ""stamp"". If you don't work hard in school you will not actually know the shit your degree says you do. So even if you get a job you'll suck at it."
3857,"I can second this.  I have a friend who is a chem major.  Completely slacks off.  She's shown up drunk to class before, gotten drunk DURING class, and refuses to study over extended periods of time.  Since we go to a co-op school, she was preparing to apply that upcoming semester.  She couldn't remember anything of basic gen chem, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry (she had just taken it that past semester!), and physical chemistry...the course she was halfway through THAT semester.  Needless to say, she didn't get a co-op.  She has a mediocre GPA and doesn't remember anything from her classes.  She'll graduate and be able to put down that she received a chemistry degree from a good university, but that doesn't mean she'll actually be of use to companies."
3858,"Oh god, PChem. 7 years later and that final still gives me flashback nightmares. Nothing quite like a class where you can get a 'C' with a 37 percent."
3859,"Hey, that's how some of us get past Cal II."
3860,"Nah, people get work experience or actually just self-study if they want to learn. The reason they pay ass-tons of money is because they need certified learning.


You wouldn't go to a doctor who didn't have a medical degree but was capable of performing heart surgery."
3861,"Many people are doing a job that has nothing to do with their field of study. And most good jobs are closed to people who do not have a college degree, even if the college degree they have has nothing to do with the job. 

If you're going to college to learn, that's nice, but the fact of the matter is, many if not most people are going to get that stamp. Taking out a loan that is the equivalent of the cost of a house just to learn is… noble, but not really practical for most people. Unless your parents are paying your way or something, in which case, sure, follow your heart."
3862,"""online classes at real school institutions like . . . ACLU""

???"
3863,Majored in Minority Studies
3864,Minored in Majority Studies
3866,"OK, that makes more sense."
3867,"The only reason most people take an education is that ""stamp"" though.
I have thousands of lectures, hundreds and thousands of studies and books, millions of articles at my fingertips. If I want to learn, I can learn."
3868,"Well, it will if you write it on there."
3869,Wait.... It *shouldn't* say that?
3870,"I don't have an online degree, but I did take 13 courses from a distance ed university (AthabascaU in Canada), mostly for medical school pre-requisites. 

Pros: very flexible, if you are really motivated, you can get through the coursework much faster than at a brick-and-mortar school. I finished a German course in 10 days. It allowed me to work 20-30 hours a week with a lot less stress - not commuting and parking like 1.5 miles from the lecture hall several times a week saves you a lot of time and energy. 

Cons: if you don't have your shit together, you will fail HARD because no one's holding your hand. At a lab session, I met someone who wanted to go to vet school and was taking a few courses to meet her pre-reqs. She was late with every single assignment for no reason - she told me she had done them all, but just didn't submit them. She then didn't submit the lab reports within the one-month deadline and failed the course. She tried to appeal, but the university basically told her she knew full well what the expectations were. 
Edit: another big con is social isolation"
3871,"First off, there are 3 types of online degree programs:

1) For profit, DeVry, University of Phoenix, Art Institute of Yo Mamma, etc.

Not sure if your school falls into one?  See the words: ""For-Profit"" and ""Nationally Accredited"".  Nationally Accreditation is the same accreditation used for all schools that advertise on Judge Judy.  
The only times these are useful is when you are in a dumb organization that needs a check mark in the degree column for you to move ahead.  Think government mainly.  

2) Online, respectable universities.  These are universities that are solely online or distance, but are respected.  Western University's and University of Maryland University College (UMUC) are the only two that come to mind.  
These are respected, but the rich alumni base and career centers are not available.

3) Online portions of brick and mortar universities.  Many schools are using this.  Colorado State, a bunch of Cal-States.  Most of them offer the same degree as on-site.
These are respected as well, some as much as the real university, some not so much (think Harvard Extension School).

And there are a bunch of extension and certificate programs that are pure money-making schemes for real universities.  If your workplace will pay for it, consider it free training.  But the certificates, unless highly technical or geared towards a specific skillset, are laughable if you put them on a resume.  

These programs are great for nontraditional students who may be mid-career or training for a specific job (e.g. teaching).  These are not good for students who have no skills and just want a degree and think jobs will flock towards them.

And, with the exception of the for profit scams like DeVry - what you put in correlates to what you get out.  You can enroll and put in no effort and pay someone from India to do all the coursework, and you will get a useless degree that furthers nothing."
3872,"Most universities are nationally accredited. Which doesn't really mean much. It's REGIONAL accreditation you want to look for. It means much more than national accreditation, and also means most (undergrad) credits will transfer. Credits from specialty schools - such as Full Sail - won't transfer into another school's bachelor degree programs. That means if you spend $80k+ on their recording or film program, you end up having to do all your general classes over if you want a career change later on."
3873,I always wonder if companies who are hiring find online courses legitimate enough
3874,I think if the degree is from a reputable institution it still holds water. [Indiana](http://www.iue.edu/online/programs.php) and [Duke](http://www.learnmore.duke.edu/online/) for example both have online degree options.
3875,"I agree with this as well. I'm currently a full-time student through Arizona State's online program. While I know it's not the most prestigious, it's definitely credible. 

Online was the only format that would work out for me. The closest university to me doesn't offer night classes, plus I do so much better with an online format."
3876,"Ned Flanders describes it best:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHtj_8ZcmGY

But seriously, ASU is a credible university."
3877,"Haha! From my understanding, it's a party school. That's why I never log on to the portal without doing at least four shots of tequila first."
3878,"Apparently, it's no longer regarded as a party school. New management came in some time ago and upped their rankings."
3879,">But seriously, ASU is a credible university.

Not so fast my friend.

^^^^Beardown"
3880,BEARDOWN
3881,This is good news to me. I just started ASU for a BAS & so far the workload for online classes has been somewhat heavy. I didn't want to invest so much and have it bite me in the ass later if the school wasn't credible.
