8417,Sad dad
8418,Tad bad.
8419,All about keeping those clients returning for work!
8420,Are you American or do you live elsewhere? Cause apparently Sensodyne is great from anywhere except America.
8421,"Yep. I’m american and always pick up sensodyne outside the USA. It has a compound called novamin in it. It’s the fucking BOMB. 

FDA hasn’t approved it because they want more proof of the “repair” aspect in the title but no one else cares. Stuff is great. I travel outside the USA enough to make sure I always have enough but it’s also like $6-7 on amazon/eBay. 

Look for sensodyne repair and protect with Novamin."
8422,"I doubt that's the real reason seeing as remineralization has long been proven, and Apagard and BioMin are also barred.

But lord knows I will take every opportunity to undermine a corporation's decision to prevent a proven innovation from reaching the population of America."
8423,"Because of shady patenting on NovaMin and all Bioglass, an enamel repairing innovation that Americans have missed out on due to this.

Only get it shipped from Canada or overseas specifically with NovaMin, otherwise there's no point to the price."
8424,"I buy Canadian sensodyne with Novamin, a drug the US FDA ~~doesn’t allow~~ hasn’t yet reviewed and allowed, through Amazon. Shit is unbelievable!"
8425,The FDA has nothing to do with it. It actually was sold over the counter in the US at one time. When GlaxoSmithKline bought the company that made it they pulled it and only let it be sold through dentists offices. I buy mine on Amazon from the UK.
8426,"Novamin is amazing.  Because one corporation controls it in America, you can't get it without a prescription.  (unless you buy overseas)"
8427,"When you pronounce GlaxoSmithKline fast, it sounds like an alien language"
8428,"I'm very curious -- are there clear results? What provoked you to say it's ""unbelievable?"""
8429,"Novamin remineralises teeth in a slightly different way than fluoride - so it helps slow down caries, and definitely reduces sensitivity in places where enamel is eroded. 

Evidence doesn’t show it to be overwhelmingly better, but it seems to be a slight but significant remineralising advantage against normal toothpaste: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422065/
Certainly enough for me to spend the extra $20 a year to use it."
8430,"do you click on the first link on amazon, or do you have a specific seller that you like?"
8431,"Any fluoride toothpaste that is approved by the American Dental Association, Canadian Dental Association, Oral Health Foundation (UK), or your region’s local dental association.

8432,You'd be surprised how many toothpastes aren't approved!
8433,"Fun fact:  There's a chemical additive (Novamin) that is widely available in Europe that helps regenerate tooth enamel.  In America, this chemical is not available without a prescription.   Thanks to shitty American corporations, if you want quality toothpaste, you have to order it from overseas.

Novamin is awesome.  I had a pain in my tooth - my dentist did an xray and didn't see a cavity.  I figured it was some microscopic thing.  I use this toothpaste, no more pain."
8434,"As long as it’s got fluoride and not charcoal it’s good. 

Spit don’t rinse, the whole point of using paste is cleaning then leaving tooth protective stuff on your teeth, rinsing washes it off! It’s like putting your coat on to keep warm to go out to not get wet then taking it off when you go outside! It’s a habit hard to kick if you are used to it!

It’s the technique that makes a difference. Where the gum meets the tooth (front and back) twice a day for 2 mins and in between with interdental brushes/ floss once a day. 

Electric brushes with pressure sensors and timers make brushing piss easy and can even be enjoyable. Change heads every 3 months like you should be doing with your brush anyway and if it’s wearing too quickly you need to be more gentle.

Also if you have to use mouthwash, (preferably with fluoride in) use it 30 mins after brushing or during the day, you don’t want to wash off what you just spent 2 mins putting on!

Note- am dental nurse not dentist but give oral health advise most days"
8435,Isn't it disgusting to not rinse your mouth after brushing especially if theres still bits of food stuck?
8436,"What I do is brush once thoroughly, rinse, and then apply a light second coat without rinsing. Feels way cleaner than just letting old food stick around.




This also prevents me from swallowing all of the toothpaste I used every single night, only however much was used for the light second coating."
8437,The rinse no rinse debate is still up in the air. Studies have shown it really makes no difference.
8438,How can I not rinse? That’s gonna leave my mouth dry as hell when I go to sleep.
8439,"Just brush regularly, a decent one would work. Only thing you should avoid is cheap whitening ones. They destroy your enamel slowly under the work of ""whitenening""."
8440,Here’s a real answer! Im a RDH. There’s a prescription fluoride toothpaste by 3M called Clinpro5000 (or alternatively prevident by Colgate but I’m not a huge fan of it) that is super gentle and inoffensive in taste (it’s almost kind of bland)  and has hardly any grit to it so it’s very safe for enamel. It’s 1% fluoride and not only does it prevent cavities but it will help to prevent recurrent decay around any existing restorations you have and is GREAT for sensitivity. The only con is you do have to buy it from your dental office.
8441,"I live in a developing country that doesn’t really sell Crest, and I don’t like Colgate at all, so I started buying the ClinPro from my dentist.  I love the flavor and the lack of a lasting taste in my mouth.  But it was expensive, about $12 a tube, and the tubes were kind of smaller than a US sized one."
8442,You can use it once a day to stretch it out a bit longer and use a different toothpaste for the other times you brush! Works best at night.
8443,"I mean this is pretty overkill for anyone without high caries risk. Your standard 1000 ish ppm supermarket toothpaste is going to be fine for most people. Its more how you brush that determines if you are more likely to get decay or not. For most, the 5000ppm toothpaste is just a waste of money."
8444,"Most of the population is moderate or high risk. It’s not overkill at all. People are just uninformed about what determines their risk for caries. Think about what percent of the population takes some sort of medication with xerostomia as a side effect. All of those people are high risk. If you have a patient with interproximal restorations on most or all of their posterior teeth they are high risk, even if they brush well. Same with crowns. Patients should know they can get a better life span out of their restorations by using a rx toothpaste. I would say 75% of the patients I see over the age of 40 fall into one if not both of those categories."
8445,"Anyone used Elmex?  Found in Germany and made with Sodium Monoflorophosphate and another ingredient which is not sodium fluoride. 

Keen to get the Reddit view on this product"
8446,"Ah, good old Elmex. I think every German has used it at least once in their life, most probably as a kid. It’s actually really good and even though I’m using a different brand now a lot of my friends still use elmex. The tv commercials always recommended to brush with Aronal in the morning and to use elmex in the evening. No idea what the difference is but lots of people swear by that method."
8447,"Blah blah not a dentist, but mine tells me to use whatever brand doesn’t have SLS since it causes canker sores."
8448,"Have a good friend dentist, and his answer to this is the one you will use that has fluoride and no polishing beads,"
8449,"Tl;dr Oral hygiene guide


__-Toothpaste guide__

*""The best toothpaste is the one that you'll use; at the end of the day it is the mechanical disruption of plaque from the toothbrush, floss, ect, that has the biggest impact on both cavity risk and gum health.""*

__-Don't Buy__

Activated charcoal toothpaste. Repeated use (more than once per month) will erode your enamel. Read the label. Slight whitening may be seen due to abrading the enamel.

Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). More and more brands are adding or upping the amount, which is a cheap detergent that can cause an tissue sloughing reaction in some people. It's not harmful in the long term, usually goes away, and most of the time people don't even realize they have it.

Triclosan (eg. in Colgate Total line) has linkages with bacterial resistance and endocrine disruption.

""Whitening toothpastes"" is a cosmetic claim, the manufacturers do not have to provide any proof, and the independent literature has been unable to find any evidence that it has any whitening action.

Hydrogen peroxide, early discussion of a very very small increased cancer risk.


__-Buy__

Novamin™, bioglass which forms a barrier through remineralization that will prevent cavities.

Fluoride >1'000ppm for adults.

Potassium nitrate (for sensitive teeth)



__-Flossing__

*“You only have to floss the teeth you want to keep.”*

If your gums bleed they're infected, floss consistently and bleeding will stop in a week+.

Not okay just popping the floss in an out, best to make a ""C"" shape around each side of the tooth.

Water flosser

Interdental picks



__-Toothbrush guide__

Brush 3 minutes~
Change head every 1-3 months

Electric toothbrush
Pressure sensing and timers=best

Slow back and forth motions, circular motions unnecessary.

Light pressing when brushing, use your wrist for movement/pressure control, rather than fingers.

Manual toothbrush
Circular motions.
It’s the technique that makes a difference. Brush where the gum meets the tooth (front and back) twice a day for 2 mins and in between with interdental brushes/ floss once a day. 



__-Mouthwash__

(preferably with fluoride in) use it 30 mins after brushing or during the day, you don’t want to wash off what you just spent 2 mins putting on!

Do spit after brushing, but rinsing after brushing reduces the fluoride effect. Allows the fluoride to stay in contact with your teeth for a bit longer.


-My Questions:.   


Zinc: whitens, helps immune system, fights bacteria and plaque? https://youtu.be/U1iCZpFMYd0

How effective are Vitamins in toothpaste?

How good is Aronal & Elmex? German morning and night toothpaste.

If there are multiple types of fluoride, many mentioned, what are the best?

Organic fluoride

Edit: formatted slightly better"
8450,Guessing 9/10 pick the same one
8451,Not many dentists on Reddit?
8452,"Dental student here. 
1. You need an adult toothpaste if you are older than 6 years old and it NEEDS to contain fluoride.  Ideally greater than 1000 ppm. 
2. If you have a bunch of cavities or high risk of cavities (ie having dry mouth) then you must ask your doc for a prescription toothpaste of 5000 ppm. 
3. The most important step is to SPIT NOT RINSE YOURE TOOTHPASTE OUT. (Spit as much as you can out)
Rinsing with water or listerine after you brush  washes the fluoride down the drain and it needs to stay on your teeth for longer."
8453,"For most of my patients, the only ingredients I care about are fluoride, which has the same concentration in all over-the-counter U.S. toothpastes, and potassium nitrate for the surprisingly large number of people with sensitivity. As others have mentioned, hands down the best toothpaste is the one that you will use; at the end of the day it is the mechanical disruption of plaque from the toothbrush, floss, ect, that has the biggest impact on both cavity risk and gum health.

That being said there are a few nuances to add:  
More and more brands are adding or upping the amount of sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) which is a cheap detergent that can cause an tissue sloughing reaction in some people. It's not harmful in the longterm, usually goes away, and most of the time people don't even realize they have it, but I still have a hard time being ok with it.

I also personally stay away from any toothpastes containing triclosan (such as the Colgate Total line), it's not my area of expertise but it has enough linkages with bacterial resistance and endocrine disruption that I choose to avoid it.

When it comes to whitening toothpastes, I have yet to hear an argument as to how or why they work. Because it is a cosmetic claim, the manufacturers do not have to provide any proof, and the independent literature has been unable to find any evidence that it has any whitening action. Along those lines I counsel my patient to avoid any toothpastes or rinses with hydrogen peroxide as I have heard some early discussion of a very very small increased cancer risk. Likewise, charcoal is often an enamel destroyer.

When it comes to the electric versus manual toothbrush debate, they are theoretically identical, but as many other have mentioned my hygienists can usually tell when someone makes the switch. There are a few studies showing that the timer function of the electric toothbrush is actually the key in that it gets people to brush longer.  

In short, I am a dentist, and have the classic, super cheap Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste in my bathroom that I put on a manual toothbrush and I use a WaterPik every night. I have no mouthwash in my apartment and my lone spool of floss lives in my travel bag."
8454,I swear to God if somebody recommends Tom's of Maine
8455,I had a friend whose parents allowed 0 sugar in the house. She said she'd take the Tom's toothpaste and hide under the dining room table so she could eat it out of the tube... I can't imagine being so desperate for something sweet that I'd eat toothpaste to get it.
8456,I wasn't allowed sugar as a kid. I'd lick candy wrappers people left lying around.
8457,"If I were a parent, I don't think I'd make that choice unless the kid had health problems that made sugar a bad idea. People are going to crave sweets, so why not let the kid have it in an environment where you can control the intake, rather than make them go to great lengths to sneakily get sugar?"
8458,Thoms Of Mane - Use with your horse hair toothbrush as instructed.
8459,"I miss the metal tubes.  Mostly because the only place I ever had Tom's was at my grandparent's place and I have really fond memories of that toothpaste because I associate it with seeing them and remembering especially my grandfather who passed about 8 years ago.

Eventually as an adult I remembered that and looked at getting it, but they switched to a standard toothpaste tube (reading online this was after the brand was sold so it no longer independent).  It being the metal tube was a big part of what made it special to me as a kid and with it not having the metal tube it just didn't really bring back the memories."
8460,Did you get the strawberry flavor? That stuff was the shit.
8461,"Dentist from Ontario, Canada...here's my two cents on some questions below:

1. CDA Gold Seal of approval is only given to Colgate Total due to its antibacterial abilities from an agent called TRICLOSAN... essentially, it acts to kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.

2. In our dental school and the only other in our province we were all given free power toothbrushes (by Oral B, I think?).  There was one per student.  I still use mine.  Now when they poll any of us asking what toothbrush brand we use, what do you think we say?  9 out of 10 of us won't throw away free :)  They are all generally the same (hence why I can no longer remember the brand I'm using)

3.  Sensodyne and similar products contain POTASSIUM NITRATE that help reduce sensitivity - we recommend this for patients affected by sensitive teeth - but I personally believe any toothpaste with this agent is equally effective...I don't trust GlaxoSmithKline too much (nor many other big pharma)

4.  Listerine really only has effectiveness for 15 minutes for killing bacteria. After that, you are pretty much as susceptible as you were before the rinse.  Most mouthrinses contain alcohol actually dry the mouth and puts you at a greater risk for decay (less saliva = less protective effects of natural antibodies to kill bacteria and fewer minerals to reduce acid dissolving teeth)

5. Fluoride in toothpaste is always recommended as:

    - it functions to prevent the bacteria that cause decay from functioning properly (it basically screws with their metabolism so they have trouble living a normal 'bacterial life')

    - it decreases the dissolving effects of acid on teeth by increasing surface tension on the enamel (outside layer of tooth)

    - patients who are at increased risk of cavities are given prescription fluoride rinses to lower their susceptibility to tooth decay"
8462,This is more like the answer I came here for.
8463,I hear Sweden dentists also recommend that you masturbate to decrease tooth decay.

8465,Thank you for this! Great answer!
8466,"Graduating dentist here (so everything is freshhh). A few points to clarify everything.

1. **For the average person, it doesn't matter what toothpaste you are using**: The purpose of toothpaste is to facilitate the removal of bugs from your teeth. It does through providing abrasives (why it's so gritty) and a mint-flavor (to encourage brushing through the minty freshness). SECONDARILY, it provides fluoride to help prevent cavities and triclosan to prevent plaque formation - **BUT** take these away for the average person and not much would change.  If you really want to know: 
-sensitive toothpastes are great for people with sensitive teeth BUT do not have any advantages for everyone else
-whitening toothpastes are simply more abrasive and can assist with removing extrinsic stains (wine, coffee) BUT are not able to whiten the underlying shade of teeth. This increased abrasivity DOES NOT increase its ability to remove bacteria.

2. **In fact, you don't technically need toothpaste at all**: What removes all the bacteria? The mechanical action of brushing. The mechanical action of flossing. If the chemical composition of your toothpaste mattered, then we could all just use mouthrinse and not need to brush. But studies have shown that mouthrinse is practically useless in all but compromised patients. I do not recommend mouthrinse to my patients as they believe that this can substitute for brushing - this is WRONG. 

3. **Frequency of brushing is much more important than the type of toothpaste you are using**: Brushing once a day is usually sufficient to remove all the plaque AS LONG AS YOU ARE DOING IT FOR LONG ENOUGH (see below). Studies have actually shown that most people can get away with brushing one every two days - but professional recommendation is that you brush at least twice a day because let's face it - if a health professional tells you to do something everyday, you do it once every two days, and if he tells you to do it weekly, you do it monthly. 

4. **Duration of brushing is much more important than the type of toothpaste you are using**: Studies have also shown that 2 minutes (30 seconds per quarter) is the optimal amount of time to brush to sustain a level of gingival health. Anything more and you can't get get more than 'healthy' gums - anything less and you risk leaving behind plaque in specific areas that accumulate over time. 

5. **It does not matter how you brush as long as it is comfortable for you.**: There are specific ways we like to teach our patients to brush, but by and large these are difficult to adapt to once we have become accustomed to our childhood method. Switch to a soft toothbrush and you will be okay. 

EDIT:
6. **Floss regularly!**: A couple people mentioned that I forgot to emphasize this, so editing to add this. Extremely important to floss around all your teeth. If you have big spaces between your teeth, you can purchase 'interdental brushes' that are like mini toothbrushes and they fit in the gaps between your teeth. Wax vs no waxed floss doesn't matter - whatever is your preference (wax is easier if it's really hard to fit the floss between your teeth). If you have braces, it is possible to purchase special types of floss that you can fit in between the wires and slide through the gaps."
8467,"Question for you, I brush twice daily for long enough according to you. I also use mouth wash, Crest Complete, but still get cavities. Is there a reason?"
8468,"I don't know your individual circumstances, so take the following as a general statement: 

Decay is primarily to do with your **diet** more so than anything else. Simply put, bacteria need sugars and an overabundance of this leads to decay.

So if you are drinking heaps of sugary drinks (juice, cola, etc) or eating sugary foods (ice creams, cereals with lots of sugar content, etc), it won't matter how much you brush because the bacteria will have an ample sugar supply. 

More so, frequent sugar intake (sipping your cola over time, snacking on sweets in between meals) amplifies the risk of decay. Why? Because you are giving the bacteria a prolonged exposure to sugar. Contrast sipping at coke while having a 4 hour gaming session with with drinking cola at dinner time - you tend to wash the sugar away with everything else at dinner but not during gaming. 

What isn't stated enough in oral health education is that toothbrushing prevents gum disease but only marginally helps prevent against decay. The fluoride in toothpaste that you use twice a day can only strengthen your teeth so much against the constant acidic attack from bacteria that occurs all day.  

Take home points?

1. Modify your diet to reduce sugar intake (that's good for your overall health too)
2. If you do drink/eat sugary foods, attempt to confine them to mealtimes
3. If it is between meal times, drink some water/milk after those sugary drinks
4. You can also buy extra fluoridated toothpaste - ask your pharmacist for which ones are available in your area. *And remember not to rinse after brushing - spitting out the excess is enough*."
8469,"When I was young I went to a dentist that would tell me he needed to chase the cavity bugs out of my teeth. I literally thought there were ants in my teeth till I was about 10, and I needed a dentist to get them out every six months."

With regards to keeping your teeth clean, it really doesn't matter which toothpaste you use as long as your technique is good.  I guess it sounds weird, but there are techniques for toothbrushing. At school we teach the Bass Technique. The best video I found was for the [modified bass technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqCpZm6s_dE), which is pretty similar. The optimal situation would be brushing twice a day (with any toothpaste), flossing once a day, and visiting a dentist or hygienist every six months to make sure any buildup you missed (that is now calcified since it has been there so long) is removed. 

I always get the toothpaste that I like the flavor of, because then I have more of a reason to brush.

Now if you have [sensitivity issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity), then you're going to want to get a toothpaste like Sensodyne or anything really that has potassium nitrate in it. The potassium will form salt crystals that will essentially occlude your dentin tubules on the exposed dentin of your sensitive teeth. There are some other formulations that can help with sensitivity, and if it is a continued problem you should go see a dentist. 

As others have pointed out, Colgate total does have the antibiotic [triclosan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan) (like many other household products). Now I like Colgate Total, but like I mentioned above this really isn't the root of the problem. If you only brush once a day and do a poor job, no amount of triclosan is going to help you. The nature of the microbial biofilm reduces the effectiveness of things like antibiotics anyway (they can't penetrate very deep into the biofilm). 

TL;DR - Get the one you like the taste of, learn the [proper technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqCpZm6s_dE), brush twice a day and see the dentist once every 6 months."
8540,"I asked my mom (a dentist) and this was her reply...

Sounds legit."
8572,My dentist just recommended I buy one. I'm unsure as to whether it's worth the $80.
8573,"It's worth it. We bought one a few months ago and it's brilliant. At first you won't think it's doing its job, as it's really gentle on the teeth. But once you're hooked, you're hooked. Go ahead and buy one. Just send the warranty in. And if your dentist is offering one on discount for cash with no receipt that says SAMPLE USE ONLY NOT FOR RESALE across the side? Don't buy that one. It'll crap out in three months. Trust me."

8577,">  At first you won't think it's doing its job, as it's really gentle on the teeth.

For me, it kind of hurt the first couple of days I used it.  It was bearable, though, and after 2 days I got completely used to it and the pain went away."
8578,My experience was like this as well. The first few days I thought it was going to vibrate the teeth right out of my skull. Since then it's been awesome. Just wish replacement heads weren't so expensive.
8579,"My dentist showed me my before and after photos about a year after purchasing and using one (on their recommendation) and the results were undeniable. Plus, cleanings took much less time because there was much less plaque to scrape off. 

Mine is a sonic care and the price has come down a lot. Gums are healthier, teeth are cleaner and stronger...I've had to buy maybe 3 heads in the past year to replace older ones from Amazon but they most definitely work.

Plus, if you're ever hesitant about brushing, just think of the investment you made and it's a little more convincing to do it twice a day."
8580,"Before you throw out the old head get a pair of pliers and rip off the two magnets. They are fairly strong and quite handy because...

8581,"They absolutely kick ass.  Historically my track record with the dentist has not been great.  The Sonicare toothbrushes tell you when 2 minutes is up, and they work so well.  No cavities since I've had one."
8582,"I read on my package of Trident(R) gum that chewing it after eating helps clean and protect teeth.

I'm going to be chewing it anyways but as long as you're here: how true is that?  Is it just because the gum grabs little bits of leftover food?"
8583,"Gum that contains xylitol can help to kill plaque bacteria, as well as increase saliva (which contains enamel rebuilding minerals) significantly more than plain gum.

Trident contains xylitol, but because xylitol is expensive, they only use like 5%, which doesn't do anything.

Buy 100% xylitol gum."
8584,Paired with this advice is to keep it away from pets. Xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs.
8585,The chewing produces saliva which helps rinse your teeth.
8586,"~~I believe the last time I saw a question like this is /r/askscience, the conclusion was that extra saliva is bad for your teeth.~~

From what I see on Google, the higher pH of saliva helps neutralize the acid produced by bacteria.  Since I can't remember the thread in /r/askscience where I saw that, I'll retract my comment."
8587,Do you recommend mouthwash? My dental hygiene seems to have gone up after using it; less plaque on my teeth.

8589,"Why is a soft bristled brush better? I've always preferred the firm ones because it feels as though it's doing more.

Are the electric brushes any better for your teeth or do they actually wear the teeth down over time?"
8590,"Same reason you don't use steel wool to scrub off your glasses.  Although it feels like it's doing more, it'll slowly wear away the out enamel on your teeth, and actually doesn't get as well into the nooks and crannies to get gunk out because they don't flex as much."

Generally its recommended for people to use soft bristles because its not only softer for the gums, but more so to avoid damage to the layer of enamel on teeth."

8659,"Dentist - as long as it has 1450ppm Fluoride in it (check the back of the label) I don’t care. I buy the cheapest I can. 

If you want desensitising toothpaste the most important thing is fluoride, and after that - different brands have different additives but most work on the same principle. 

Whitening toothpaste either abrades your teeth to get rid of surface stains or has a “blueing” agent to counteract the yellowing on your teeth

Some gingival health toothpastes have chlorhexidine added. 

But if you just have normal human teeth without a specific problem - just get own brand.

Edit: there are also prescription only toothpastes with high fluoride content that your dentist can prescribe. But if you don’t need these (ie if your teeth aren’t in a state of disrepair) then they won’t benefit you

8672,"No but I worked in a Dental research clinic for a few years as a lab tech/Data Analyst for studies that covered this exact topic, and had some long interesting conversations with the Dentist running the study about it. He doesn't not recommend using any cosmetic whiting paste that contain abrasives. Silica and other similar abrasives will cause permanent damage leading to more decay later. Interestingly, one of the pastes were were studying, was seeking to be a replacement for what was supposed to be a safer enamel abrasive, which contained microplastic balls that were far less abrasive. However they were discontinuing them, for good reason due to risks of harm to the environment/aquatic life where the plastics would eventually end up, they also were embedding in peoples gums, especially people with forms of gum disease that loosen around the base of the teeth."

8675,"For someone who is extremely poor and can't afford toothpaste, what do you recommend beyond baking soda? I ask for a friend that volunteers with kids in low SES areas."
8676,"I’m not sure how poor is extremely poor, but they do sell generic toothpaste at most dollar stores which for the volume is about as cheap as baking soda."
8677,"I've heard generations of poor people (e.g. kids, their parents, and grandparents) all say the and thing about brushing their teeth with baking soda. And how much they hate it and often prefer to not brush their teeth at all than use baking soda. So I don't think there's a similarly priced toothpaste or else they would have found it. Baking soda is 89 cents for like an 8 oz carton, which lasts probably 100+ brushes.  I doubt the dollar store toothpaste can compete with that.  But I will look next time I'm there to see if an option exists."
8678,"If you’re spending $.89 on something that a) you don’t use because it’s gross and b) does longterm damage to your teeth, you’re better off spending $.99 and fixing both problems at once."
8679,Yeah.  I can imagine that generational instruction happening. It can be hard to break this patterns.  Even when the evidence stares you in the face.
8680,"ultra brite toothpaste is $1 at walmart, and aim toothpaste is $0.85 at walmart. both contain fluoride, are free of baking soda, and are full-size tubes of toothpaste that should last a while (not travel size)"
8681,"Yeah,  I've changed my opinion on the baking soda price thing.  Several other commenters suggested that the premise of ""many poor people across generations have told me that baking soda is substantially cheaper"" as potentially being a generational myth that gets passed down from parent to child and eventually,  that just becomes a thing they believe. So yeah,  I'm wrong on this one."
8682,I just found a 3 pack of Colgate for under $4 at Walmart. No one is too poor that they can’t scrap together $4 for months worth of toothpaste. You can find $4 on the ground in a day if you look for it.
8683,"Dude,  I'm only relaying what I've heard.  And when you compare $4 for toothpaste to 89 cents for baking soda,  that price difference can feel very real."
8684,"$4 for 3 tubes, and baking soda doesn’t cost 0.89, it cost closer to $4 for a box."
8685,"Yes,  baking soda is less than a dollar.  At least in every grocery store I've ever been in.  Just looked it up and I can get it at Target for 85 cents"
8686,There are absolutely people that poor in the world....
8687,Not in the western world.
8688,"So, be straight with me:

Stannous fluoride is making a huge splash in the toothpaste market.  Is it really batter than sodium fluoride?  I used to buy the toothpaste with the two active ingredients to fight gingivitis bacteria, but stannous fluoride is supposedly like a catch-all."
8689,"Stannous fluoride has been used in prescription mouth rinses for years for patients who have had gum or oral surgeries to reduce the bacteria for better healing short-term.  Stannous fluoride is derived from a metal and it differs from sodium fluoride in that it not only prevents decay, but it also kills bacteria.  It has only popped up in OTC TPS in the last several years.  The problem with Stannous fluoride is that it is very irritating to the gums and surrounding tissues with long-term use.  As a hygienist I was shocked to see this added to toothpastes for this reason.  Indeed, I’ve had countless patients come to see me with burning, sloughing gums from using it.  
I would only recommend these formulas for short-term use after surgical deep root cleanings.  Crest Pro Health, Paradontax and one of the Sensodyne brands all contain Stannous fluoride and should be used with caution."
8690,My wife had this reaction to it.
8691,"I posted this same thread in the dentistry subreddit, and someone asked this same question, which received the following reply:

8693,"That seemed to be the consensus in everything I've read today, yes, but I'm not a medical professional."
8694,"oh, and in case you're wondering, standard Colgate Total was the most-recommended one, because it's not very abrasive, and uses Stannous Fluoride."
8695,"Oh, that's interesting!  I use the one with a whole bunch of checks and I'm beginning to wonder if it doesn't matter since the active ingredient is really the only thing that'll do something."
8696,"Exactly. Only the active ingredients are active, lol. People say that the other ""features"" the pastes advertise are more or less gimicks, and may or may not have any noticeable effects, but hey, if you find it works for you, then ride that placebo effect all day long. Otherwise, in terms of actual dental health, fluoride + not rinsing after you brush + brushing properly + flossing is all you need."
8697,"Wait, are you not supposed to rinse after brushing?"
8698,"Apparently not! That was one piece of advice that was common to each reply i got from the dentists. It makes sense -- when you get a fluoride treatment at the dentists, they leave it on for a few minutes to do its work. When you brush your teeth, if you immediately rinse out the toothpaste... well, you aren't getting any of the fluoride. Like at all. According to them, you should brush your teeth, spit out the excess, and then just... carry on with life. If you really dont like the taste/feel, you can rinse, just give it ten mins or so before you do."
8699,"Do you have any scientific reference for your baking soda comment? Not doubting you, just having trouble finding one myself!"
8700,"Baking soda is abrasive. There's no complicated research behind it, it's just a physical property of baking soda."
8701,Isn’t toothpaste abrasive anyways? What’s the difference if you use baking soda or a high whitening toothpaste? I could be mistaken about how toothpaste actually works
8702,Not an expert but I think you’re basically assuming abrasiveness is the same between the two when it’s more like choosing two very different grits of sandpaper.
8703,"You're correct. Take a look at the raw numbers and you'd laugh at the idea that baking soda was capable of abrading teeth at all. Toothpaste is definitely abrasive, and in a 1-1 comparison is far more abrasive than baking soda.

But baking soda is well-known to whiten teeth through abrasion, and it's not a 1-1 usage. Baking soda is pretty much pure, whereas toothpaste is mostly not comprised of abrasive substances. Additionally, many of the people using baking soda add in some acid, which magnifies the abrasion tremendously. There's some evidence that the abrasive elements of normal toothpaste lose their effectiveness in \~20 seconds, whereas baking soda keeps abrading longer, so that's another potential difference.

The final note is that fluoride is the real champion of dental care, so baking soda is just more abrasion on top of whatever abrasion you get from the fluoride-containing toothpaste you should be using."
8704,Is 1000ppm ok? I can't find 1450ppm
8705,"Not ideal. Would usually recommend that for older children, but it’s better than no fluoride at all!"
8706,What would you recommend for teeth whitening?
8707,I’ve heard crest strips are good but you can’t get them in the UK. Otherwise; go see your dentist and have them bleached professionally. Wouldn’t bother with anything you can buy from the supermarket.
8708,Wait ok re: the baking soda thing... I use arm & hammer toothpaste mainly bc it's dirt cheap and I'm poor af. It has baking soda in it.......... Should I stop??
8710,"But I thought all toothpaste had some sort of granular material in it, most often sand or whatever, and arm & hammer just used baking soda instead....."
8711,"Any thoughts on hydroxyapatite toothpastes?
Supposed to remineralize your teeth.
My GF just got some APAGARD Premio that I’ve been using in lieu of the typical Aquafresh..  Feels like normal toothpaste for the most part?"
8712,"Hydroxyapatite toothpastes have been popular in Japan for decades. Any Japanese dentists reading this?

I can't tell from the literature whether nanohydroxyapatite remineralizes better than fluoride, but people swear by it. It's said/claimed to get calcium deeper into teeth than fluoride, making enamel whiter and more opaque. Since it apparently works great, I was surprised to not find progress pics online. It's hard to even find studies lasting more than a few days. 

I started using Apagard recently. I'm making my own progress pics, and if I stick to the program I'll post them someday. I'm guessing it'll take a long time for calcium to migrate inward.

Don't fall for the ""regrowing teeth"" crap. Deep remineralization alone would be awesome."
8713,"I too was hoping some japanese dentists would comment on Hydroxyapatite pastes.

The only thing I can offer to this discussion is due to my background as a geologist and geological engineer: the mineral ""Apatite"" is what enamel actually is. It's the mineral Apatite, plus some biological scaffolding. 

Fluoride ions can fit themselves into the crystal lattice of enamel and, in doing so, strengthen it, but it's different than simply supplying more Apatite building blocks directly to the teeth/enamel, which is what Hydroxyapatite toothpastes attempt to do."
8714,Is apagard safe to use during pregnancy? It says safe for children 6 and older but doesn't go into detail.
8715,"Most toothpastes say that simply because some kids don't realize that they shouldn't be swallowing toothpastes. It's not that there's anything particularly harmful in it, but rather, because the concentration of fluoride in toothpaste is meant for topical application, not ingestion, and can cause some mild indigestion. 

As far as it's effects on pregnancy... I'm not qualified to comment on that."
8716,"If children swallow toothpaste containing fluoride on a regular basis, thee unerupted teeth can be damaged by fluorosis."
8717,"Thank you very much for that add-on, I didn't know that!"
8718,You’re welcome!
8719,"Any toothpaste that contains fluoride should not be swallowed by children or by pregnant women.  I can cause fluorosis or “mottling” of the enamel on unerupted teeth in children.  They do make non-fluoridated TP for young children that won’t hurt them if ingested.  Once they start using fluoridated TP, use a tiny pea-sized amount of toothpaste until they are definitely not swallowing it any more."
8720,"Dentist here! As long as it has flouride in it, the brand doesn't matter you can buy the cheapest. If you have trust issues for unknown stuff just buy the most common brand. Our expectations from a toothpaste is to help brushing activities for plaque removal and helping the regeneration and preservation (that's why we are looking for flouride) of enamel tissue."
8721,I had bad oral hygiene for a while because of depression. I have more sensitivity now at a young age because of it. Is it really possible that using flouride toothpaste or an enamel restoring toothpaste like sensodyne can restore the enamel I destroyed? Can restoring enamel help with the discoloration?
8722,"Well, sensitivity can be linked with several problems from damaged enamel (causes the exposure of Dentin tubules. That makes cold and sweet sensitivity) to cavities or periodontal diseases like gingivitis. For your question about enamel, flouride in toothpaste is helping you to prevent the loss of enamel from acid erosion by creating powerful covalent bonds apetide molecules which is more powerful than -OH covalent bonds. So it does not help you to regenerate your enamel but saliva itself helps you to regenerate your enamel. 
For simple enamel damage: this one may caused by lots of things from hard brushing to not brushing or consuming lots of acidic nutrients. Sensitivity solving toothpastes basically helps to plug Dentin tubules and solves sensitivity but within a month or so. My tip for a faster solution is after brushing your teeth wait with the foam made with brushing of toothpaste for ten minutes before washing your mouth. With that you can make your tubules exposed with the plugging particles more than usual brushing and can have a faster solution.
For periodontal diseases: you should start to brush your teeth from gingiva to your teeth. I'm warning you it will bleed and feel swelling but that shouldn't prevent you from doing it because it's a paradoxical less you brush more painful it becomes. Don't make aggressive brushing be gentle to your teeth.
P.S.: you should see a professional no matter what because neither these solutions will solve your problem completely nor I can examine your situation. And in Dentistry early solutions are always cheaper and less painful.
Best of luck 🤞"
8723,"I posted this same thread in the dentistry subreddit, and many dentists commented the same advice -- don't rinse your mouth immediately after brushing. Just spit out the excess and let the rest sit, and this way you're actually giving time to the fluoride to do its thing."
8725,Wait you’re supposed to rinse your mouth after brushing?
8726,Of course you should
8727,Oh.  Well I guess I should start doing that then.
8728,Think like this. You start to wash a dish brushed it with detergent removed the stains etc. You have to rinse it otherwise all of them will stay on the dish again. Okay I admit not a proper example but you get the idea
8729,"Once enamel is damaged to a certain point, it cannot be “repaired”.
Very early breakdown of enamel can be remineralized and the damaging process can cease.  Once a cavity reaches the dentin or middle layer of the tooth, it cannot be repaired by any toothpaste or topical remedy.  Sensodyne isn’t special.  It’s just another brand name.  It does contain an additional ingredient called potassium nitrate, which is an excellent desensitizer for minor root exposure and cold sensitivity.  Any toothpaste brand can say it desensitizes because technically fluoride is a desensitizer. However, only prescription fluoride is truly effective for desensitizing. But the potassium nitrate added to the formula boosts the desensitizing effectiveness.  So, if a toothpaste advertise that it is for sensitive teeth, turn the box over and read the active ingredients.  If potassium nitrate isn’t listed, you are just buying pain fluoridated toothpaste.
No, discoloration can only be fixed with bleaching or major dental work."
8730,"Just want to ask:

In your opinion (without pushing a brand), do you recommend mouthwash and flossing?  And in which order is best?  I brush, floss, and then mouthwash every night.  I have pretty good teeth but I've been told my enamel is weaker than most (some weird genetic trait) so I try to take extremely good care of my teeth, but if it doesn't help, I'd prefer to just forget about it."
8731,"Well tbh you're a dream patient. Flossing and mouthwash are so helpful for preventing from dental diseases since most of them are caused by poor hygiene. Genetics of course matter in this case but I can assure you if you won't care to your teeth things will not be good for them. Genetics means you have to be more careful than most people which you are doing as far as you say.
So keep flossing and mouthwashing my friend"
8732,"This makes me feel better.  I heard that study claiming flossing was a waste of time and mouthwash was actually hurting your teeth.  It’s not that I distrust Colgate and Crest websites, but it’s not like they’re going to say, “oh, yeah, this stuff will wreck your teeth, but buy it anyway you moron.”"
8733,"I have had three separate dentists and dental hygienists say the same thing to me: If they had to choose between having me ***ONLY*** brush my teeth, or ***ONLY*** floss, they would rather I floss, without question. It's simply the far more important of the two cleaning procedures (their words), as the vast majority of cavities start in the spaces between the teeth and below the gum lines, not on the totally-exposed surfaces of the teeth."
8734,"I guess that makes sense.  Bacteria probably can’t do much against teeth as long as there’s a protective coating there, but getting into the gum line is like tunneling under a castle wall.  Not a dentist, so if I’m totally off, please let me know."
