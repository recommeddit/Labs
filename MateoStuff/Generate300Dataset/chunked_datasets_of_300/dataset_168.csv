54947,"Typically systems will use coagulant aide (which is really just a different type of coagulant) during periods where for whatever reason the main coagulant in not working effectively, usually due to cold water conditions for a coagulant like alum. Chemically, these coagulants have longer chains of molecules (polymers) which are effective at removing particles, but residual polymer in the water after clarification will cause the filter to be clogged faster and backwashing will have to be done more often. So in terms of cost its a tradeoff. This is why your company only uses this product as an ""aide"" to coagulation as opposed to only using polymer all time time. Plus, the chemical itself can be more expensive."
54948,"What happens when the activated carbon is ""full"", can it act as a bed for bacteria? (I've never used a water filter, tap water is fine here)"
54949,"Yes, in fishkeeping, charcoal filters can serve as substrate for Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter."
54950,"Activated carbon can grow bacteria and develop biofilms.  It doesn't need to be ""full."" When the carbon is full it simply stops adsorbing contaminants and just becomes a filter media, at that point it is not doing what you want it to do and is pretty useless because it isn't a particularly good filter media on its own.

I will say there are filters that make use of biological growth to beneficially treat water, but it is not something you want to do on your own at home."
54951,I heard it can make cheap vodka smoother to drink
54953,"I agree with you in that they would not be a certifiable treatment for untreated drinking water in and of itself (in most cases).  Carbon filters in general can significantly improve the quality of untreated water, and is actually one of the processes used by most municipal treatment facilities.  The OP did not specify treated/untreated water.

My understanding of the question is the OP is wanting to know if the carbon filters actually do anything useful.  And yes, they are one of the most cost-effective treatment processes in creating safe drinking water.  Activated carbon has been used for thousands of years in this manner."
54954,"I would just like to note here that Brita claims that its pitcher filters reduce chlorine, copper, cadmium, and mercury (the latter three, Brita claims, lead to adverse health effects in the longer term). Meanwhile its faucet filters reduce lead, TTHM, VOCs, lindane (pesticide), 2,4-D, alachlor, atrazine (herbicide), chlorine, and sediment. You can view their user guide (linked below) regarding reduction claims for these substances, which have been certified by the Water Quality Association.

However, according to [Brita's user guide](http://www.brita.com/pdf/BritaUsersGuide.pdf), their filters are not meant to be used as a water purifier. That is to say, they do not purify the water you drink. They therefore recommend that any water ""that is microbiologically unsafe or of unknown quality"" be disinfected either prior to or after the use of a Brita filter, namely because Brita filters do not perform this function.

So you don't want to take your Brita filter to your nearby river and assume it's safe. However, with regard to treated tap water, Brita has been certified to reduce the aforementioned substances to the amount listed in their user guide, but as konzahiker notes, tap water is already quite safe, within the standards set by respective government agencies. So while you may be reducing those substances, unfiltered tap water is already safe to drink according to the standards set out by the EPA and others."
54955,"I think it's common sense that dubious water should be sterilised, preferably by boiling."
54956,Why would that be common knowledge?  There are plenty of filters that are marketed towards cleaning river water and what not.  The ones from Britta aren't however.
54957,"I'm not an expert but obviously if you go camping you boil river water. Of course if there's nasty chemical stuff like heavy metals or whatever, that's not going to help. Maybe that's what the filters are for?"
54958,"While you may think it is obvious, there are plenty of filters that will clean river water without boiling it first."
54959,I rented at a place that had well water. The brita made the water palatable.
54960,"I live on a well that's in the Marcellus shale...we have some of the poorest water quality in the country (lots of iron, calcium, and sulfur.) We do have a water softener and a millipore line filter that gets rid of a lot of the junk as it's coming into the building, but we still get rust stains and rotten egg smell with the water, especially after it rains. That is to say, it's so bad that a good water treatment system doesn't get rid of it all.

We use a pur filter water pitcher. It may not get everything, but it definitely makes the water palatable. Without it the water tastes awful. Gets expensive, though...we have to replace the filter twice a often as recommended."
54961,With all the fracking happening maybe it would be safer to cache rainwater.
54962,"No fracking anywhere near here (yet), but it's a pretty hot issue. The companies that have already bought up land are really fighting the locals on it. Many municipalities in the area have banned it or tried to ban it, but many of those are being contested in the courts at the moment.

Fortunately I don't own this property (I'm renting), so I'm not stuck with it if they do start fracking. But that doesn't mean I don't care about the issue."
54963,"Likewise, but since Brita themselves clearly state in their manuals that their filters do not make water SAFE, I figured I didn't want to deal with someone dumping diesel in the neighborhood and just went with a big old jug of water from the store."
54964,Correct most municipalities will use activated carbon after the disinfection process.  This removes VOC's in the water as well as the residual disinfection byproducts created.  This also is part of an ongoing effort by the EPA to reduce the byproducts which are harmful in the long term.  So yes your tap water is slowly killing you. http://www.epa.gov/safewater/disinfection/stage2/pdfs/fs_st2_finalrule.pdf
54965,"Your answer supposes a reader living in a first-world country with high standards for municipal tap water, so it's irrelevant to me.

Suppose I am dealing with *unsafe* water. I'm currently in a country where the tap water is not safe to drink (and not just for my yankee guts; everyone boils it before drinking it). What I'm doing is running the tap water through the Brita filter first and *then* boiling it; the idea being to have the Brita filter remove the heavy metals, and then the boiling to kill off the germs. Does that make a difference?"
54966,"it is important to change the filters or they will get moldy. Happened to me and I realized it quite late. So, if this in mind, one could even argue it can make your water worse if not correctly used."
54967,"I'm not sure about the particular model you have, but ours has a small display on top, near the handle, with bars (similar to mobile phone signal indicators) which tell you when you need to change the filter.

If I were cynical I'd imagine they're safe a lot longer than Brita tell you,"
54968,"The question is whether the filter makes water *safer*, not safe. I'd guess that, in an emergency and with no other options, you'd be better off running water through a Brita filter than not. Would be interesting to know whether that's true though."
54969,"you're half right. They don't do anything if you're using them on city water because city water is treated to drinking standard. However, they'll do good when you use well water instead and in places where they don't have good water system."
54970,"We live on a well, and use a reverse-osmosis filter for our drinking water.  Can anyone compare what that does vs. a Brita filter?  Does it remove minerals, like lead, and does it screen bacteria?"
54971,RO will get rid of pretty much everything. Our RO water tests at 9ppm compared to the tap water which sits at 300ppm of dissolved solids.
54972,"Hey, thanks for that!"
54973,"I'm currently working in Saudi Arabia and running my science experiment through my Brita definitely makes my project much nicer. I'm trying out a combination of mixing juice, sugar and/or honey and wine yeast."
54974,"I work for an environmental laboratory and test drinking water in particular.

Brita takes out the chlorine (which they use to sanitize the water) and lead (which shouldnt be there in the first place).  It might also remove some organic compounds that influence taste.  But if you got say 1000mg/L solids in your water and run it through a brita, you are gonna get back water with like 998mg/L solids.  ""Solids"" being whatever dissolved material whether it be salt or cyanide is in the water."
54975,"Don't think so.  I think it just removes some dissolved ions for flavour.

If you're worried about bacteria, forget it.
You need a membrane with very small holes to filter out bacteria. These filters need to be pumped with a lot of muscle.  I've sat for hours waiting for the bloody things to process samples."
54976,"What about this filter?

http://www.lifesaversystems.com/about-us

Claims to filter out even viruses to a size of 15 nanometers."
54977,I tested this the other day with my standard fish tank ph test kit. I filter the water through the brita for my small fish tank the water that comes out of my tap is quite basic and disgusting.. Interestingly after I tested the filtered water it was yellowish indicating the water was then slightly acidic after filtration. It definitely does something...
54978,"Right, it obviously does *something*, but the question is whether that something makes the water 'safer'."
54979,"I've tested the same way.  The tap is perfectly neutral pH while the Brita and some other brands always come out acidic.  Oddly enough, PuR filters make the water alkaline."
54980,"If the water was distilled, would all the ions and organic molecules be removed?"
54982,"reverse osmosis is a close second to distillation, and potentially a lot cheaper."
54983,Will they remove arsenic dissolved in the water? We use well water and I'm told that's a problem in the area where I live.
54984,"depending on the filter... yes:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater#Small-scale_water_treatment"
54985,"One would need a higher quality filter to begin removing chemicals and such.

My personal water filter is a [Multipure](http://www.multipure.com/) filter that removes much.  Chlorine etc.  Not floride as that's a much more expensive filter they sell."
54986,"As has been stated here in many posts, tap-water here in the US is generally safe. However just because it's safe to drink doesn't mean it tastes good. For instance in Texas, our water came from a lake. For a good part of the year the water would taste horrible (like dirt). I'm sure that the water was still safe to drink, it was just hard to drink. So my family bought a Brita, and the water was actually bearable to drink."
54987,"I would recommend checking out their [website](http://www.brita.ca/). If you do this, and compare with the municipal regulations in your area (or state or province, however water your water is regulated) you'll have a better understanding of what Brita can or can't do. If you can't find your local regulations, check out the EPA or WHO websites. They offer a good explanation of what should and shouldn't be in your water from a health focus. 

A Brita is not designed for removal of potentially harmful (i.e. pathogens) contamination. Also, Brita maintenance is super important. An old filter is probably doing more harm than good."
54988,"Water filters can remove some or all of Fluoride from the water. Drinking only Fluoride-free water can be detrimental to your health.

> Unnecessary use of bottled and filtered water is costly and may result in adverse dental health outcomes.

source: [Bottled, Filtered, and Tap Water Use in Latino and Non-Latino Children](http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/5/457)

Edit: fixed ambiguous wording"
54989,"> Fluoride... which can be detrimental to your health

Got a source for that?"
54990,"Whelp, that is the opposite of what I was trying to say! I think I have fixed the ambiguous wording now. Thanks for the heads up."
54991,"Britta filters are not intended to make water *safer* to drink, but rather taste better. Namely, they are a simple particle and activated charcoal filter. Activated charcoal is effective in removing halogens (such as chlorine used to treat water), some volatile organic compounds, and various sediments. It can remove some microorganisms to. It won't remove dissolved inorganic compounds, heavy metals, etc.

We use Britta filters to remove the chlorine taste from our residential water, and in that capacity, they are quite effective. This summer, we had a coliform contamination problem in our area and we did not rely on the Britta filter to remove the possible contaminant (though, the pore size is such that it would have been at least partially effective in that capacity, it still wasn't worth the risk)."
54992,">It won't remove dissolved inorganic compounds, heavy metals, etc

Yeah, but you usually don't find very high concentrations of *dissolved* heavy metals. Instead, you tend to find them in particulate and colloidal forms, which can indeed be filtered."
54993,"My Brita filter is the kind that attaches to the tap.  It has a little light that blinks red when it is time to change the filter.  Does anyone know if that light goes off after a certain amount of water goes through it, after a certain amount of time, or does it actually sense the amount of accumulated crud in the filter?"
54994,"Carbon does not remove dissolved solids such as calcium and magnesium. It does effectively remove many dissolved organic compounds. Most toxins are removed excepts for nitrates and phosphates.

In the real world, I would say that carbon makes water safe at least 90% of the time. Carbon is much more effective than mechanical filtration.

It would take a book to really explain things."
54995,"Short answer yes.

Long answer meh.
  
Depends on the filter and how small of particulate filter they contain.  Most filters will advertise that they remove certain heavy metals and spores.  Are these things good to have in drinking water?  Probably not.  Does it matter in the concentrations that we are talking?  Probably not.
I also don't believe there are any scientific studies that demonstrate health benefits from water filter usage (there are studies demonstrating that the filters work, just not that it makes a difference to overall health)."
54996,"German television just reported a few weeks ago that there is an increasing problem with uranium in western european ground/tap water.

Since Farmers are using large amounts of fertilizers, uranium is introduced as a side product.

Britta filters remove this kind of heavy metall crap as well...

I'm using it and really like the water's taste. 
Living in Munich my water is mainly from the area between Munich and the Alps, considered to have a very high quality, nevertheless using Brita filters it tastes even better when making tea or coffee. My girlfriend is using it as well and was even advised by her cat's vet to give the cat filtered water in order to significantly reduce dental plaque/calculus. It seems to work."
54997,"It depends on what you're starting with.  If you're talking about tap water from a municipal water supply in a modern (1st world, industrialized) country then it's already safe, and all the Brita filter does is make it taste better by removing safe but bad-flavor-causing stuff.

If on the other hand you're dealing with untreated ""wild"" water of unknown origin and content, then since Brita's own user manuals tell you it does NOT render such water ""safe"" I would trust them to know and wouldn't assume it does everything you'd need."
54998,Well if you have a brita filter and read on the box you will clearly see that the filter dont make water safer to drink.
54999,"My recently-purchased Pur filter says it removes 99% of any benzine that might be present in my water (local contamination, perhaps?).

So ya, I think it has the potential to make drinking water ""safer."" That said, tap water in the US is extremely safe."
55000,Anyone have any thoughts on the ZeroWater filters?
55001,"For sure it makes tap water more drinkable, but don't really think it makes it safer. Tap water tastes like old pipes. Britta filters make water taste smoother, which is good enough for me."
55002,"adding to this (instead of starting a new thread), how often should the filters *really* be changed? mine has a little light that turns red when it's time to change the filter but it went from green to red in only 4 weeks time. i can't afford to keep buying the damn things but i want ice cold drinking water so i keep using the thing anyway. what's the consensus on this?"
55003,"All I can tell you is that when I poured red Kool-aid into my Britta, it came back as pretty much clear water.  It did have a slightly pinkish tint."
55004,"The whole east coast is a mountain range (hence the Appalachian Trail running from Georgia to Maine) so it depends what type of hiking, preferred climate zone, time of year, difficulty level, etc. Throw a dart at the Appalachian trail and find the nearest town. 

I am partial to White Oak Canyon Trail in Shenandoah National Park (a spur off the AT) and Old Rag Mountain Loop. However, they can both be busy in peak summer season. 

I thought the hike to Preachers Rock in Georgia was also well worth it for a day hike. Its fun to meet AT through hikers on the first leg of their journey."
55005,"ay ive been to both Shenandoah and old rag, nice"
55006,Appalachian Trail through NH and Maine.
55007,Is it hikable in the winter or is the snow too much?
55009,Seriously. Hike at your peril after late October.
55010,"My rule of thumb is that if you're asking that question, the answer is no.

If you've got enough years of experience and the right gear, you can, but it's one of those where going in without knowing what you're doing can kill you quite easily."
55011,"In summer, you're *probably* not going to die. You might be cold, lost and miserable from your night in the woods, but *most* people don't die.

In winter? Get lost or into trouble and you're going to be a popsicle by morning if you're unprepared.

We're also over the yearly records for numbers of rescues with people flocking to the outdoors. While rescue should never be relied on, resources may be thinner than usual as well."
55012,"Depends on your skill, equipment and experience, and of course the weather."
55013,"Yes, but you need to be prepared for it."
55014,"There are section that may be closed.

You may be able to hike in some areas.

North Carolina state parks have held New Years hikes the past few years. Not sure if they will do them this year."
55015,"New Hampshire mountains are one of the snowiest, windiest, and coldest mountain ranges in Northern America where various jet winds meet in winter and dump ton of snow. They are deadly. Pretty much from northern New York to Maine, it is really cold in winter. Pennsylvania mountains and ridges are not that high, so really the next interesting mountains are stretching from WV down to Smokies. Since the tallest mountains east of Mississippi are out there, it is cold and not that hikeable   due snow. I was from western NC to SW VA to WV in winters and it always snowed or had flurries. Some areas do not get enough snow to ski, but sleet is very common in that region. We usually go ski up north to Poconos or Adirondacks due a better snow pack."
55016,Anything in Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina is worth doing.  It has some of the most spectacular waterfalls!
55017,"Try Gatlinburg TN. I used it as a base to drive out to some nice hikes. There was a nice mix of being out in the middle of nowhere and fun tourist traps and restaurants, and everything in between, that were all equally accessible within a 20-30 min drive. It's also across the mountains from Asheville NC which is also fun."
55018,"As in just town to visit with accessible trails?

Can't really go wrong with Harper's Ferry.

Easy to get to. Right on the AT and the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah are absolutely beautiful."
55019,"Lake Placid is up in the Adirondacks, and there's great hiking and views up there."
55021,I drove the Mt Washington Auto Road when I was up there a few years ago.  Just driving up that mountain was impressive... 80 degrees at the bottom and 40 at the top with awesome views along he way.  I’m sure hiking it would be even better but I had the children with me.
55022,"> Mount Washington in NH is really cool.

It's great, but not for hiking unless you're experienced and are prepared for the weather."
55023,"White Mountains of New Hampshire. Just don't mess around with weather, it gets real serious real quick up there.

Adirondacks in NY are also great, but clearly second best for me. The further south you go the less familiar I am."
55024,Adirondacks in upstate NY are truly beautiful. You’re also within range of the AT and Green Mountains of VT.
55025,Anywhere on the AT.  From what I've heard its easier in the north but you'll want to wait till spring/summer because hiking in snow is a bitch.
55026,"Mount Katahdin in Maine is, by far, the best hike on the East Coast.

The Presidential Traverse of the White Mountains in New Hampshire is nice as well.

Mount Colden via the Trap Dike in the Adirondacks in New York is a very unique experience.

For short hikes with beautiful scenery and unique trails check, out Acadia National Park along the coast of Maine and Mohonk Mountain House along the Shawangunk Ridge in New York (less than 2 hours from NYC). The Shawangunks also have world-renowned rock climbing routes. 

Another short hike with dramatic scenery is Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire (about 2 hours from Boston). It is the 2nd most climbed mountain in the world.

Old Rag Mountain in Virginia (about 2 hours from DC) is overrated. Instead, head a couple hours further west to West Virginia for the dramatic scenery of Seneca Rocks and the nearby Chimney Top via North Fork Mountain.

Further south, there isn't much in the way of prominent mountain tops with truly unobstructed 360-degree views, but the Alum Cave Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains is really cool. 

The summit of Bell Mountain is Georgia can be accessed by car. It has dramatic views (almost 360 degrees but not quite) and colorfully painted rocks."
55027,"White mountains in New Hampshire with their 48 4000 footers are very popular, and small mountain towns like North Conway are fantastic places to visit 

In the south western part of the state is Mt Monadnock, claimed to be one of the most hiked mountains in the world"
55028,"Also their prominences are higher than most stuff out west.

The western peaks are craggier but the east coast peaks make you walk vertically nearly as much."

See what you want to do.  I wouldn't go more northern than New York during the winter.   I haven't don it but some like Harper's Ferry and I would go south from there.   I would do section hikes."
55030,"Gatlinburg Tennessee or Cherokee NC, entryways to Great Smoky Mountains National Park."
55031,"The White Mountains.

Other than that the rest of the Appalachians."
55032,"Northern New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine"
55033,"Appalachian Trail, the Shenendoah Valley, Western NC and North Georgia are amazing to hike in"
55034,"Check out the Kancamangus Highway in NH, lots of hiking trails. It connects the towns of Lincoln and Conway which are both pretty nice as well."
55035,The Appalachian Trail through Shenandoah NP is a good place to start. I also second Smokey Mt. NP. Mt. Katahdin in ME is Awesome as well.
55036,"-I've done the Grandfather mountain (N.C.) profile trail and that was a good hike/camp trip.

-I'm partial to the Adirondaks, I have done many hikes around the high peaks and found everyone one to be enjoyable. 

-If you want to do a ~25 mile hike, there's nothing better then the devils path in the catskills"
55037,Acadia National Park has a ton of awesome hikes.  I liked the Bubble Rock trail even though it was short.  Blueberry Hill is a nice long hike.  If you are more adventurous then I am you can try Precipice Trail.  It's only 2 miles but it have a 930 ft elevation gain and iron rungs to climb up.  All in Maine if you do not know Acadia.
55038,"North Carolina has so much great free stuff. 

I would check out the Linville Gorge. You can camp there and there are tons and tons of very challenging and rewarding hikes with astonishing views. [Table Rock](http://www.summitpost.org/table-rock/185534). [Hawksbill](http://www.summitpost.org/hawksbill-mountain/200592).  You can also hike down into the gorge and swim. And there's [Linville Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linville_Falls#/media/File:Great_Stone_Gorge.tif).

Panthertown Valley is pretty great. And, of course, there's Smokey Mountains National Park."
55039,"Check out the AT from Roan to Grayson Highlands.  Maybe post in r/appalachiantrail - they have a great spreadsheet of hikes based on mileage.

I’d also suggest the Art Loeb trail in NC.

Being from FL, I think you’d be okay hiking in NC and VA above 3k elevation.  It’s cooler in the higher elevations."
55040,I am more hooked to AT and smoky mountain as it looks more feasible economically. I am planning for that. Could you please sent me any other suggestion about the trails and hikes nearby? I tried to search for the spreadsheet you mentioned above but I couldn't find. It would be really helpful if you could direct me towards it. Thank you! :)

I will check out the trails you mentioned in the spreadsheet and plan accordingly. Mostly, I am targeting 3-4 days."
55044,"Per your original question - I would NOT recommend the Whites if you don’t have experience. They will whip your butt. The Smokies in August will be just fine. Most of the AT in the south would be fine in August. It’ll be hot, but no hotter than July or September. Just be sure to drink lots of water, bring salty foods and/or electrolyte powder, and above all, practice good LNT practices no matter where and when you go. 

Also get the tiny bottle of 99% deet and treat your clothes with permethrin. Ticks are nothing to mess around with!"
55045,Thanks caup! Could they add your guide to the sidebar in the AT sub?  It’s so helpful.
55046,A lot of the AT is mountainous.
55047,"Vermont, New Hampshire, upstate NY, (Adirondacks). Tons of hiking."
55048,"Whites mountains in NH/Maine or the adirondacks in upstate NY, both have dozens and dozens of incredible hikes/views."
55049,Hike Mount Washington. It’s a beast. Or the High Peaks of the Adirondacks. That’ll keep you busy!
55050,Pretty much anywhere one the east coast will be hot and humid in August.
55051,Awesome to see my home on Reddit. I live 8 miles from the heart of the Adirondacks in the town of Saranac lake. Currently working on my 46er. I have 23 under my belt. Great picture!
55052,"Ahh that's great. The friend I accompanied is about halfway done with his 46er as well. I've only done a few of the peaks but am thinking about joining him for the remainder of his journey, and eventually finishing mine."

55060,My family and I have a summer home right on Lower Saranac Lake. Absolutely beautiful area. Good luck with the rest of the peaks!
55061,I grew up in SL.  Miss it to death.  This picture makes me miss home
55062,"Hello, fellow saranac laker! :)"
55063,To be a 46er don't you need to do them in one season?  My ex gfs parents are both summer and winter 46ers. The did all winter 46 in one winter.
55064,"No, your girlfriends parents are just on another level."

Me: it's in New York.

Other: like in Manhattan?"
55072,as a Syracuse native... this happens far too often
55073,I guess my best guess at the location of upstate New York would be the Syracuse region. This guess being based on no facts.
55074,you're guess is correct.   technically it's central ny...but i grew up calling it upstate
55075,"People from Southern Michigan call the northern portion of the lower peninsula ""up north"", and basically just ignore the upper peninsula."
55076,"We don't ignore it, it's called The U.P. It's also up north, but it's not Up North. It's The U.P."
55077,I didn't mean ignore it in the sense that we pretend it doesn't exist. I mean in the sense that it isn't up north.
55078,"That's central NY. I grew up that north of Albany is upstate, but know of people living an hour out of the city that say they live upstate too"
55079,"I've always thought that there is upstate and downstate NY, and that WNY, CNY, the north country, etc. are all part of upstate."
55080,this seems pretty plausible.
55081,"I live in Rochester, NY (WNY) and for whatever reason, anyone calling it upstate bugs me. I associate upstate with the section of NY that is north of NYC (West Point, the Catskills, Albany, Saratoga Springs, etc). Then the ADKs, CNY, WNY and the Southern Tier are all separate sections. But maybe I'm just anal."
55082,"Works for me, but the Catskills aren't upstate"
55083,"Yeah, it seems like everything in New York is either in New York City, or a city called Upstate, NY. Still haven't been able to find Upstate on a map. Seems odd considering how much I hear about it."
55084,"> it seems like everything in New York is either in New York City, or a city called Upstate, NY

Except for Long Island, then you just say your from the island... even though part of NYC is on it."
55085,"Oh my god, you're right. I can't believe how many times I've agreed to living in, around, or not in upstate New York. I don't even know what it means."
55086,I love when they interview pro athletes that get drafted by one of our teams in B-Lo and they all talk about how they're excited to see NYC
55087,Rochester checking in as well
55088,"Oh you mean buffalo 2? Kidding, upvote for not New York City."
55089,Albany checking in
55090,The land of steamed hams!
55091,"oh, not in Utica, no!  It's an Albany expression.."
55092,Here is Simpsons reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDUIGvpDolw
55093,Seriously. I had no idea central park was this big.
55094,"Yea that's exactly what it is.

New Hampshire is pretty great for sure, but I think I prefer the Adirondacks, at least from what I've hiked."
55095,"Never spent time in the Adirondacks, but went to school in the Catskills. Also lived in Burlington, VT and the view of the Adirondacks across the lake is absolutely beautiful."
55096,"If this were New Hampshire, there would be a highway running through the valley."
55097,True. But new York State has so much more space it's not fair to compare.
55098,"Still, New Hampshire's mountains are so much bigger it's hard to compare the other way.  [I took this picture on Saturday.](http://imgur.com/GlUtQ4t.png)  New Hampshire is the only spot on the East Coast you're going to see anything like this."
55100,"Yes, Mt. Mitchell is 400 feet taller than Mt. Washington (6,684 to 6,288).  But it's so much warmer and further south, you don't get the same alpine climate effect."
55101,That and we have the Adirondack Park. The park agency is super strict and does not fuck around and would not let that happen.
55102,"To be fair, Whiteface has a road that goes to the top."
55103,"Ya but the Adirondacks were more massive when they formed billions of years ago, they've just been weathered away😊"
55104,"Right by ""Nippletop"" mountain."
55105,"Nippletop, Sawteeth, Couchsachraga. The Adirondacks have some great names."
55106,"Can't forget Dix. South Dix, East Dix...All the Dix are across from Nippletop."
55107,They're getting renamed : (
55108,Anyone got specific trail info?
55109,Ohio here. I've been snowboarding in the Adirondack's on Gore mountain. The place is absolutely beautiful. They have hiking trails during the summer months. You should check it out!
55110,"https://www.theoutbound.com/new-york/hiking/hike-indian-head-and-fish-hawk-cliffs

It's a very easy 10 mile loop, most of which is on flat ground."
55111,Thanks so much man I really appreciate that!
55112,It's always nice to see my home region getting some love. It's awesome seeing pictures of this alongside...well...everything in this subreddit.
55113,"Hey guys!

Super stoked about the feedback of this shot.

For those of you who may be interested, this was shot with a Fujifilm XT1 and a 16mm lens. Shot at f/14 at 1/60 and ISO 800 at 4:40pm. The sun was starting to set towards the right side so I cranked up the ISO a bit to improve the lighting a bit.

I'm a photographer based in Montreal. If you wanna check out any more of my shots you can find my [Instagram here](http://www.instagram.com/davelasto) and my [portfolio here](http://www.brandbig.co)!

*I a word"
55114,"love the photo dude! I mentioned it already here, but I snapped a nice shot on film at that spot too - http://imgur.com/pSAGUey. Really liking your portfolio too! How do you like the XT1 for outdoor photography?"
55115,"Love that shot in film. That grain is perfect.

I really like the XT1 for all photography. It's great to travel with (I've traveled quite a bit with it). XT2 is coming out in mid-Sept it seems, definitely recommend it if you're looking for an upgrade.

Sony a7r seems great too. A bit lighter and full frame, which is great. I do like the full metal body of the Fuji though."
55116,Love montreal! Just got back from there a couple days ago. La ville est belle!
55118,"I was blown away when I went to visit my girlfriends home town in upstate and we drove to Ithaca. Holy shit it's so beautiful. 

Lakes, waterfalls, flowers, vines, huge farms and vineyards. I felt like such a dumbass- being from Colorado I assumed NY was just an overpopulated city but western and upstate NY are gorgeous"
55119,"There's so much beauty everywhere, it's hard not to imagine quitting your job and traveling.

I was in California for 4 months early 2016 and recently returned from Tofino, BC. Every single place is so special."
55120,THANK YOU for specifying both upstate and western NY.  We here in Buffalo are so tired of being called 'upstate'.
55121,">I was blown away when I went to visit my girlfriends home town in upstate and we drove to Ithaca. Holy shit it's so beautiful.... Western and upstate NY are *gorges*


FTFY, for those unaware shirts with ""Ithaca is gorges"" are very common across NY"
55122,"I'm from the mid-Hudson valley region of NY (approx 90 minutes north of NYC). Right around here is where the countryside of New York State really begins. It truly is a beautiful state.

Don't feel bad though, I now live in California and I used to live in Virginia and Florida. 9 out of 10 people I tell that I am from upstate NY immediately classify me as a city guy. Other non city New Yorkers can testify to this I'm sure. When we tell people that NY is a beautiful, sprawling state they just kind of nod and disregard us. 

I'm fairly well traveled in the US and I would say that the Hudson Valley region as well as Northern NY during October foliage is the most beautiful place in the country."
55123,I agree. Peak fall foliage upstate and the Dacks in particular is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
55124,Especially looking up at the mountains from the water
55125,I live in the Adirondacks....and it's as amazing as this view.!
55126,Wow that's nice. I live in Montreal these days so it's not too far from me. Definitely doesn't beat living there.
55127,"As someone who lived in the ADK for many years, please keep in mind the delicate ecosystem of these peaks. 

I add this here for those who I see are planning trips in the near and distant future both. Keep yourselves and our mountains safe. 

http://www.adirondackexplorer.org/stories/beyond-peak-capacity"
55128,"Hey, thank you so much for the article!  I grew up in the Adirondacks and I'm currently writing a thesis on the impacts (both positive and negative) of tourism in the ADK and this is a really helpful read!"
55129,I would love to read it when you're finished! The Adirondacks made me who I am. It's important to me and unlike anywhere I've ever been.
55130,"That sounds like something interesting a few people would like to read. As someone who visits ADK a few times a year and have gotten to know a few locals, I'd love to read about it. Especially how hiking and climbing kind have affected ADK and if they affect the environment/economy differently from ski folks or non-outdoorsy tourists, if you cover different demographics. 


Please consider posting your thesis to relevant subs when you are done!"
55131,"Indian Head is one of my favorite hikes that I've done so far. Here's one of my shots from there!

https://instagram.com/p/BF6G768CDxq/"
55132,This is great! I posted a [similar photo on IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJqTZ-LDKvV/?taken-by=davelasto).
55133,46'r reporting in... ADKs have some of the most beautiful lakes and streams in my opinion. There are few places on earth more calming than an ADK stream along a trail.
55134,agreed.  I grew up in Oregon but went hiking in the northern Adirondacks a couple weeks ago...incredibly beautiful
55135,The Appalachian Trail is on my bucket list of hikes.
55136,"The AT will not get you to the 'dacks.  It runs east of there.  It cuts into southern Vermont, near Bennington, and runs northeast towards Maine."
55137,"The [North Country Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Country_Trail) does, though. 

It starts at Lake Champlain in New York and ends at the Missouri River in North Dakota, going through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. 

Edit: [Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/North_Country_Trail_Locator_Map_US.svg/1859px-North_Country_Trail_Locator_Map_US.svg.png)"
55138,Nice! I never knew that trail exist existed.
55139,AT doesn't run through the Adirondacks though.
55141,"Oh man, if I had a few months to complete it, I'd be so interested.

I've done a few, Katahdin was by far my favorite. I highly recommend if you're ever in Maine for some time!"
55142,"Finished the AT earlier this month, you need to make time if you want to do it. 

Met so many people in towns who said they'd want to do it if they had the time.

Most of the people thru-hiking had quit their jobs."
55143,"Yes, exactly. I'd definitely need to quit my job.

Honestly, I'm sure I won't ever complete it in one go. There are just so many other things I would do if I quit my job.

Hopefully one I'll accomplish most if it in different steps. Not as gratifying, but it'd still be cool."
55144,"Adirondacks are not part of the AT, there's equally stunning views in Maine and New Hampshire but it only covers a small section of southern NY. 

They should both be on your bucket list of hikes, but don't wait until you are too old!!!!"
55145,"I quit my career, put a few things in storage and thru hiked the AT in 2014.  Best decision I ever made."
55146,"Just did it this year, best decision ever but I'm having a little difficulty getting back to real world. I'm already planning the PCT though"
55147,">  I'm having a little difficulty getting back to real world.

I can only imagine. I only did a 2 week hike and it was really hard to come back."
55148,"If you got nothing going on, look.up rocky top trail crew.  It's a volunteer trail crew for the AT in the smokys.  I did this for the whole season after my.hike.  It runs from late August to October.   You go out for 8 days and your 6 miles up on the ridgeline.  You have a free place to stay in between hitches and all the free food you can eat!   This was the perfect reentry.for me.

I planned to do the PCT in 2015, but I came back to town and spent all winter getting beefcake in the gym.  My hike took a toll on me.  I'm 6'1 and I weighed 138 when I got to New Hampshire.

Then I somehow managed to get a job in my career again and.they offered me a 20% raise over what I was making.

I literally dream of long distance hiking regularly.  Right now I'm back in the grind, getting a little more established and slowly chipping away at other life goals... But one day man...  I'm going to be back out there living the dream, cruising across the PCT and CDT with just my back pack and not a care in the world."
55149,"The Appalachian Trail doesn't go through the Adirondacks. It's a lot further south, near Monroe."
55150,"One thing I'm definitely tired of is how West Coast hikers brag that they don't need trails, and they just walk in the direction they want to go.  Yeah, go ahead and try to do that on the East Coast.  Someone will find you body in 2-5 years.  Not all areas, but in some areas definitely be careful.  Also the humidity is more of a challenge."
55151,Crips fo life.
55152,"Its tough to just walk through the woods on the east coast, mainly because of all the undergrowth. I was surprised when I went to lake Tahoe that you can just walk up into the woods relatively easily."
55153,"I don't think walking in a straight line is a thing in the east or west coasts. My local Search & Rescue (west coast) is always looking for lost or dead people. I'm sure the east coast has the same problem because all it takes is tree cover and someone without a compass. I volunteer with SAR in a county of 50,000 people and we've located 5 bodies this summer alone. 2 in rivers. 3 in forests where they just walk in circles."
55154,You're close. It won't take two to three years to find them. They won't be found.
55155,"I'm seeing references to Last of the Mohicans, but I was thinking more My Side Of the Mountain."
55156,"I spent a week every summer for 10 years at Lake George. 

I LOVE upstate NY. The drive from Albany to the Canadian border is awesome, and the rest stops are so cool. 

Great picture."
55157,I'm 45 min north of Lake George!
55158,I'm 100 feet from the lake!
55159,Unfortunately most of those rest stops are now closed. I think they just got the emergency phone on the Northway working again. Still no cell service.
55160,Where in the Adirondacks is this at? My wife and I are planning a trip there next summer to do some backpacking and car camping.
55161,"This is taken from either Fish Hawk Cliffs or Indian Head, just can't recall which one gives you this perspective (they're essentially right next to each other). That is lower Ausable Lake you're looking at. Access to this section of the High Peaks is through the Ausable Club. Feel free to hit me up with any questions. 

*edit* I got dumb"
55162,"heads up though, da bears are active as shit this year! bear canisters are always required (by law) in the eastern high peaks, but this year there has been a crazy amount of bear activity, including at the sites on the gill brook trail, which OP likely walked down after taking this pic."
55163,"I'm not sure where this is in the 'dacks, but I can confirm that you'll love them when you go.  Get some packable camp gear and get deeper in... my very favorite hike up there is Mt. Haystack (not Haystack Mountain... very different) from the Garden trailhead.  Easily combinable with Marcy, but it'd be tough to car camp that one.  IIRC, just Haystack is an 18-mile r/t, a long day."
55164,The spot where this photo was taken is called Indian Head. The peaks we did are Colvin & Blake. There are camping sites there (and all over the Adis) that I highly recommend. A good amount of campers (not too many nor too few) which makes it ideal.
55165,I miss living just an hour away from the Adirondacks
55166,"The Adirondacks is my favorite place.  I've hiked all over the US and have enjoyed many awesome views from mountains across this country, but the mountains of the Adirondacks are still my favorite."
55167,"Wow, I thought this was another one of those Norwegian fjord photos."
55168,Paging /r/Adirondacks
55169,"East coast, beast coast"
55171,"This is Indian's Head on the Lower Ausable Lake.  It's a really great hike in terms of the view you get for such a small amount of elevation gain.  There's actually a bus that's run by the Ausable Club to the bottom of the lake that will save you loads of time if you're not interested in walking in via the access road. 

Enjoy your weekend!"
55172,I agree. I always find my shots from the east coast don't do quite as well here as my west coast ones. They don't have dramatic mountains views but there are still lots of amazing and underappreciated landscapes out here.
55173,"Woo, always awesome to see upstate get some love."
55174,TIL there is a mountain near here named Nippletop...
55175,I can feel the humidity from here
55176,Last week was pretty bad.
55177,Avi pass?
55178,Lower Ausable Lake from either Fish Hawk Cliffs or Indian Head
55179,Indian Head is correct!
55180,I have an excellent picture in that same exact spot from about a month or so ago!
55181,You can't just say that and not show it
55182,http://imgur.com/pSAGUey ask and ye shall receive yo!
55183,Nice!!
55184,"Can't wait to head up that way in a few weeks.  Staying about 15 mins outside of Placid, but we make our way around the high peaks region, try to see as much as possible every time we go. Greatest/chillest place on Earth, imo of course :).  Great shot!"
55185,"Just came back from the Upper Saranac this past weekend, the Adirondacks are easily my absolute favorite place to visit."
55186,So much this! The ADK is my favorite part of the country.
55187,This is beautiful. My grandfather has taken me here. One of my favorite spots was Heart Lake and Mt. Jo as a starting point.
55188,Yes! Aspiring 46er here... 23 done.
55189,You can drink that water in Manhattan.
55190,"I hiked the Mt Marcy last month, my first time in the Adirondacks.  It is absolutely beautiful and I was very impressed at how respectful all the hikers were.  There was no litter and everyone was super friendly.  I like that it is not a tourist hotspot."
55191,Just did it last Tuesday. That was a mother of a hike. My knee is now making a clicking sound... God dammit. Still worth it.
55192,Lol I couldn't walk the next day either. Which route did you take? We went from the garden parking lot.  It was 19 miles total and we took 12hrs to complete it
55193,Van Hoesenberg from Adirondak Loj. 15 miles and yes 12 hours too. I was holding my son back on the way down but there was nothing I could do. One step at a time. Definitely hobbling on the way down
55194,Indian Head!
55195,"The key to the Adirondacks is to look down, not up. From the brooks to the bogs, the ferns to the mushrooms is what's at you feet that makes it so cool. 

So easy to look up in the Rockies and Tetons (and they are super cool) but is a more subtle beauty in the Adirondacks. 

Great pic."
55196,"I cannot get enough of the views in the Adirondacks. Just be careful of the bears, they destroyed my friends tent when we were there a couple of weekends ago."
55197,"I completely agree with you. I lived 30 minutes from the southern Adirondack many years ago, and hiked 38 of her peaks. My roommate from CA was always impressed by the ruggedness of the terrain and the difficulty of the climbing. Lots of great memories."
55198,This near Letchworth???
55199,"Letchworth is near Buffalo, opposite side of the state."
55200,That's gorgeous! And here i thought us west coasters hogged all the big scenery.
55201,"Love East Coast, just not the humidity! Beautiful photo."
55202,Man. I did a double take because it looked like something you'd see in Sweden or Iceland. I gotta go.
55203,any wolves there?
55204,"They pass through, but no native population, sadly they were wiped out and the efforts to reestablish them failed."
55205,"No wolves, but coydogs. Lots and lots of coydogs. Also lots of bear activity this year."
55206,Hey I was there this spring!!! Hiked Indian head after hiking Marcy the day before! Went to the look out for lunch then went to rainbow falls for a quick cool down/ shower !
55207,"Cold Creek checking in.  Agreed, Adirondacks don't get enough credit.  My favorite, Lake Tear of the Clouds.  Great hike that leads to great peaks."
55208,NY! Welcome to /r/earthporn!
55209,"Next time somebody disses on hiking in the Eastern part of the country, have them watch Last of the Mohicans. The trails they run are absolutely gorgeous."
55210,Unfortunately the filmed it in North Carolina.
55211,Camped there several times when I was younger. Mount marcy!  Highest point in NY. I remember that last like half mile is literally uphill gaining 1k in elevation. It was raining so the rocks were slippery as was trees/grass. Made it up tho! Was just looking at those photos the other day.Beautiful scenery. Wildlife is awesome too!
55212,"Hey, **points++** for not PhotoShopping the hell out of your color palette!"
55213,"Thanks man!

I touch up contrast, exposure, highlights, and shadows but have been trying to do less color manipulation. Ultimately the best shots are those composed well."
55214,You didn't by any chance snap this shot with a polarizer as well did you?  :D
55215,"Unfortunately not, would have been great to get rid of more highlights."
55216,"Wow, can't believe they named that place after the chair. /s"
55217,"That's a great pic.  But, I like winter in the Daks the best.  Early breakfast at the diner in Keene.  Doing a warmup run on Chouinard's Gully.  Never new I could have so much fun in -20 degrees fahrenheit.

Now, if we could just figure out how to keep out all those French Canadians?"
55218,"Um, our economy depends on them. When the Air Force Base closed in my hometown the Canadians coming down to shop got us through it. Now it's one of the top micro-cities in the country and the only city to not only get back to where they where pre-base closing but to be doing better. They may be annoying, camp out for weeks at a time on the Wal-Mart parking lot, and inexplicably purchase shopping cart loads of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (I've seen this more times than I can count) but with out them it would no longer exist."
55219,Ahh those Quebs. I'm from the States but live in Montreal these days so I know what you mean ;)
55220,"The Adirondaks are the raddest, most accessible mountains coming from NYC. Really amazing place, and a HUGE area. Things get a little more wild in New Hampshire and Maine, but the Daks are spectacular."
55221,Hiked up Cascade Mountain at Lake Placid a few weeks ago. Pretty incredible view and all the rock scrambling made the ascent a lot of fun.
55222,Can confirm: is Naboo. Am Gungan.
55223,Gorgeous! Much love for NYS!
55224,"As much as I love the mountains of the west, nothing feels quite like the deep ancient forests and mountains of the east. I love the eerie feelings brough about throughout some of the Appalachian trail in NH and Maine on cool summer mornings. Scenes like this are so awesome."
55225,I thought the body of water was an ice cream cone. Guess that's where my mind is.
55226,This looks a *lot* like somewhere I've been in a dream before.
55227,This was my favorite hike in all of my ADK adventures. This same spot in the fall is truly unbeatable.
55228,"I grew up on one side of the blue line and went to college across on the other side. 

But I spent a lot of time in The Park, one of the few things I get homesick for, other than winter on the Tug Hill Plateau. 

I'm from the North Country, not the city like my folks."
55229,"Nice, I'm literally 200 yards from the Blue line to the north."
55230,"A great place to be. 

Even hiking in Vancouver I find myself comparing it here to the park. 

And I come to the same conclusion... 

The mountains here are young punks, striving to be as bad ass and awesome as their great grandparents, the Adirondacks."
55232,Is that Upper Ausable Lake?
55233,"The Adirondacks in upper NY are my favorite. Lots of water, beautiful summits, and endless trails."
55234,"The ADKs are tremendous - beautiful, varied terrain, etc. - but what I really love is that the back country is underused. Most visitors don't leave their car for more than a few hours.

[This site](http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html) will help u plan a trip there."
55235,Thank you guys so much. That was actually first on my list!
55236,"As a resident of NC, I highly recommend basically anywhere in [Pisgah National Forest] (http://www.hikewnc.info/trailheads/pisgah-national-forest/). First hike I ever did in the area was [Catawba Falls] (http://www.hikewnc.info/trailheads/pisgah-national-forest/grandfather-ranger-district/catawba-falls/) and I still highly recommend it as a day hike. But if you want to get as far away from civilization as possible, you can't beat [Linville Gorge] (http://www.ncnatural.com/Resources/Adventure/Gorge/Linville-Gorge.html)."
55237,"The White Mountain National Forest in NH. Check out trails in the Presidential Range, its top tier country in the Northeast. Vermont and Maine also have some excellent lands, I'm sure quite similar to upstate NY."
55238,"The Great Smokey Mountains fall on the lower limit of North Carolina. There are tons of [intertwining trails] (http://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/upload/trail-map_JULY13-full.pdf) that can make for any number of hiking adventures.

The park features mountain ridge hikes, panoramic views, history, waterfalls, wildlife, interesting geological features and more! 

I highly advise Charlie's Bunyon, Chimney Tops, and Grotto falls. All of these hikes are withing proximity of one another. Let us know what you decide on!"
55239,"Week-long loops are tough. Doing a two car shuttle would let you do a chunk of one of the long trails.  Actually, doing part of the Long Trail in Vermont would be a good choice.  It's much more remote feeling than SNP is.  

I'd look at the White Mountains in New Hampshire. There's enough trails there that you could definitely do a week-long loop, or do an end-to-end with the AMC's shuttle service running you back to your car at the end. The scenery is about as epic as the east coast has to offer. There's a bunch of above treeline alpine hiking, waterfalls, moose, beaver, etc.  But it comes at a price; there's lots of restrictions on campsites, and you usually have to pay."
55240,"This is a very informative comment!

If possible, I'd highly recommend the two care shuttle, it's the best way to hike anything in the Northeast because like this poster hinted at, good loops are damn near impossible to find."
55241,"Yeah, I did a week-long section of the AT this summer (actually the SNP section that the OP passed on), and the logistics were an enormous pain in the ass.  We were flying out so two-car shuttling wouldn't work: the solution involved planes, cars, buses, trains, and subways.  It was easier to just hike the whole damn trail."
55242,"Haha, yup! Those horrific logistical problems seem to be an east coast thing (maybe just the northeast) specifically. It's kind of sad."
55243,"You could easily wander around the dolly sods in WV for a week. Lots of various trails, mapped and secret. Its quite far away from any roads. And its got the best campsites hands-down.

If you choose this I'll even point out my favorite secret campsite to you in PM."
55244,"The Black Forest in PA gives you some of that isolation you've mentioned.

There are about 50 miles of trails in the following loops.

http://www.midatlantichikes.com/bfts.htm

http://www.midatlantichikes.com/id194.html

There are other good trails in the area if you need more mileage."
55245,"If you can't find a good loop, you can always hike out three days, turn around and hike back."
55246,"Hit up the [Presidential Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Range) they are a damn good hike, not for a week, as they are only 19 miles one-way."
55247,http://www.trails.com/toptrails.aspx?area=10013
55248,Smoky Mountain National Park is relatively uncrowded in the spring. Too many options there to describe. Buy the trails illustrated map online and pick out a route.
55249,"I'll ditto /u/stajlocke's recommendation of Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  If you have access to a car it's about 3-4 hours west of Charlotte.  There's a ton of options here- including portions of the Appalachian Trail, as recommended by /u/JohanCzaczke.  It also wouldn't be hard to put together a loop itinerary so you don't have to worry about backtracking.  And finally, April puts you in the height of wildflower season in the southern Appalachian Mountains, so the scenery should be pretty good.  

Make sure you do your research on the regulations and especially the permit system- it would suck to show up only to not be able to hike there because you didn't get a permit.  

Other options worth considering include Linville Gorge (check on permits here, I don't think they are needed in April but you'll want to be sure), the Mt. Mitchell/Black Mountains area, the combined Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock and Citico Creek Wilderness Areas, and the combined Shining Rock and Middle Prong Wilderness Areas (note that fires are not permitted here)."
55250,"Dolly sods, we would be within a days drive.   You could make a nice 3 day loop.   It’s a beautiful place and worth the drive."
55251,Smoky Mountain National Park! The appalachian Trail is a great day hike. And most of the campsites should be available around now.
55252,Hike the Appalachian trail. It’s so beautiful.
55253,"Newfound Gap to Fontana Dam or Iron Mt Gap to 19E (goes over Roan Highlands) are both hikes which can be done in two or three nights.  Would need transport for both ends as not loops but if you do not have two cars, shuttle services are out there.  Both are on the AT and I think the Smokies you need to reserve shelter spots in advance or did when I did it a few years ago.  Both fun hikes.  Boone, NC is near Roan Highlands and a cool town.  Grandfather Mt is nearby and cool too.  Smokies has so much stuff in it and nearby.  Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Dragons Trail near Fontana Dam, Dollywood, etc."
55254,"Thanks very much to all for the suggestions, you guys are awesome"
55255,"I’m based in Charlotte.  I like views so you can find them in all these recommendations.   Put the title into YouTube and you’ll get a flavor for the area.
