45643,The Xbox 360 is still supported on Xbox live.
45644,Left for dead and left for dead 2 have brought me hours of joy!
45645,GRABBIN’ PILLS
45646,Get the dead space trilogy. Some of the best games on the console
45648,"If you like shooters, left for dead and left for dead 2 are worth getting. 

Multiplayer, all the zombies and swarms are random so its never the same experience and playing with a friend on the sofa cant be beaten."
45649,Just go for the Mass Effect trilogy. They are among the best games in history.
45650,"Beware , my friend, of the curse known as the ""red ring""."
45651,Happy gaming brother!
45652,I stay one to two consoles behind because the games are soooooo much cheaper.
45653,"In about ten years, those are going to be really expensive as antiques (especially if they work)"
45654,"You'll have fun, 

It's run its life span so it's got alot of games

Servers are still up for alot of games

You can browse the internet

Watch Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, ect

You can visually mod it for fun

Enjoy!"
45655,Go to G2A for cheap games
45656,Two games I really enjoyed in the Xbox 360 are Fable and Halo! Look in to them! I know you will love them.
45657,"You gotta play Gears of War 1, 2 and 3! Some of my best gaming memories playing those games, particularly Gears 2."
45658,"*”Wie het kleine niet eert, is het grote niet weerd.”*"
45659,Def get fallout 3 and new vegas as well.
45660,I guess I'm the only person on the planet who actually enjoys candy corn.
45661,"Candy Corn sisters unite! I especially love the Autumn mixes and the Mellow creams, ummmm."
45663,"Me too! But I cannot find them where I live, and only saw them once as a kid."
45665,"Candy corn is great, until you eat the 6th one. It's just a sweet headache after that."
45666,I know! I eat that shit like it's going out of style when it finally hits the shelves.
45667,I like the pumpkin candy corn the best :3
45668,"> I eat that shit 

What an appropriate turn of phrase! :D"
45669,I want candy corn just so I can [turn it into homemade Butterfinger bars.](http://candy.about.com/od/halloweencandyrecipes/r/Candy-Corn-Peanut-Butter-Bars.htm)
45670,Oh my...I need these in my life!
45671,I enjoy it too - they taste like little dollops of icing.
45672,I enjoy it.
45673,"We have a two pound bucket of candy corn for personal use this season. Fear not comrade, you are not alone."
45674,"Nope, that's high quality HFCS right there.  Good stuff. (no sarcasm)"
45675,"I don't enjoy it, it tastes awful, but for some reason, once I start eating it I just can't stop."
45676,I really do like it. I just can't eat too much or I get a headache lol
45677,I like it too! :)
45678,it's the absolute worst  D:
45679,The pumpkins are the best :)
45680,I like it better when it's a bit old and stale.
45681,"Best: Reese's, hands down

Worst: Candy Corn. Dear lord that shit is awful"
45682,"Amen. A-fucking-men.

Reese's Cups are the only correct answer here. (Alternate answer: Reese's pumpkins.)

But I have one quibble with your worst one. Candy corn is atrocious, yes, but [this abomination](http://www.candycornmms.com/mms-candy-corn-9oz.jpg) takes the cake."
45683,The Reese's pumpkins are the absolute best (along with the eggs or trees) because they have the best peanut butter to chocolate ratio.
45684,Yep. I always make sure to have a few around each of the respective holiday.
45685,I wish I had that amount of self control.. I don't even want to know how many bags I have consumed.
45686,"Reese's are like Kraft Mac & Cheese, the themed shapes taste the best!"
45687,They're also the freshest!
45688,Amen. when you step up to the larger ones they get disgusting
45689,White chocolate anything is the worst.
45690,White chocolate is the absence of chocolate. Blech.
45691,Look at his face!
45692,Agreed! Im glad someone else out there has some fucking sense
45693,"Ugh, I tried them. It was like somebody dunked an orangsicle in sugar. Blech."
45694,whaaaaaaat? I love those!
45695,Even the M&M dude looks pissed.
45696,"As a huge lover of candy corn and white chocolate, that stain that calls itself M&Ms made me want to burn something down just to get the taste out of my mouth."
45697,"Wow, even the M&M dude doesn't look happy about representing these."
45699,THEY WASH IT
45700,"I love that bit! After hearing it, I never looked at candy corn the same again"
45701,Came here to say this. Reese's is the god of all candy. It's been my favorite candy since I was a little kid. Peanut butter lovers unite!
45702,"I was at Baskin Robbins (ice cream place) with my friends, and one of them got a scoop as ""candy corn"" ice cream. We couldn't figure out what it would taste like. Wax? High Fructose corn syrup? It literally has no flavor."
45703,"B-but.. but candy corn is delicious!  Best kind of candy ever. I never knew so many people hated it, my family always loved it. I can never quite figure out what that taste is though, its definitly unique."
45704,"Best: Caramel apple lollypops. If you've had one, you know exactly what I am talking about.  
  
Worst: CIRCUS PEANUTS BARF"
45705,I love circus peanuts!!!! SO TASTY!
45706,get outta here
45707,I don't think I've ever met anyone else who likes them.... :( MORE FOR ME!
45708,I like them!
45709,THEY ARE DELICIOUS and cheap since we are the only ones that like them.
45710,My SO loves them...I can eat one and then I want to die.
45711,I've never met anyone who *didn't* like them...maybe it's a regional thing.
45713,"Circus peanuts terrify me. I hear they taste like banana? If so, I'm with you: barf."
45714,"The caramel apple lollipops are the best! My aunt came and visited me a couple weeks ago and gave me an entire bag of them. Normally I share stuff like that with my roommates, but these are mine :)"
45715,boy does the caramel part get all in your teeth though!
45716,"Yes, all the time! Totally worth it though."
45717,I passed out caramel apple pops! Yes!! I did good.
45718,I love circus peanuts. Yum! Hate anything nutty. And no peanut butter. Yuck.
45719,HERETIC
45720,I'm with you. Peanut butter is the devil's paste.
45721,"Caramel apple pops are the shit! Bought a bag yesterday. I'm missing teeth and wear a retainer, and the Caramel gets stuck to it every time. I can't get it off, and I have a lollipop stuck in my mouth for the next ten minutes. 

It's worth every second."
45722,"I love Caramel Apple Pops, but they tear the corners of my mouth up. So sharp!"
45723,I love those suckers!  It sucks that they're seasonal.
45724,Ohh god the lollipops. Did you know they have 3 different flavors?!
45725,That's what I'm handing out this year!
45726,"Best: Almond Joy. Yes, I'm a weirdo, but I freaking love them and no one ever hands them out.

Worst: That nasty taffy candy that comes in orange and black wrappers."
45727,"You just gave me childhood flashbacks of those god-awful taffy atrocities in the black and orange wrappers. I swear it was only old people that gave them out too. Barf. 

With you all the way on Almond joys!"
45728,"Oh gosh... I love those candies that were in the orange and black wrappers! I think they were peanut butter chews right?

I was going to give those out today to the trick-or-treaters but I couldnt fint them...so im giving out pez refills instead!"
45729,"Yes, they were peanut butter. Every time I ate one they just never tasted quite right and the peanut butter filling or whatever was in the center tasted off. Idk, never cared for them though. 

I like the Pez idea!"
45730,"Motherfucking Mary Janes. 

Those are those awful black and orange things."
45731,"Looove Almond Joy! Growing up, my friends used to save all theirs for me. On my 16th birthday my best friend got me a piñata full of them. Those were the days."
45732,"My mom loves Almond Joy, and I would always give her mine after I went Trick-or-Treating! I was trying to clamor for the ""favorite child"" spot :D"
45733,No one hands out Almond joy because they are a disgusting old lady candy. barfff
45734,BLASPHEMY.
45735,I love those peanut butter taffys!
45736,"I remember the Halloween that I found out that I liked Almond Joys, it was like a whole new world. It was as if all ugly girls suddenly became attractive."
45737,"REESE'S CUPS AND STARBURSTS and TWIX and SNICKERS

Worst: candy corn. What the fuck is that shit."
45738,"I want to like candy corn because it's the only Halloween-specific candy, but why does it have to be so waxy?"
45739,Haha... because its literally wax and sugar!
45740,"Oftentimes it has honey!

And sometimes its just corn syrup.

Candy corn with real honey is where its at."
45741,"I love Tootsie Rolls!! 

Best: any chocolate bars (full versions are clearly the best!) 
Worst: those cubed caramels, raisins or - dating myself - but homemade popcorn balls!"
45742,The 80-year-old grandma in me loves caramels. I'll trade my Tootsie Rolls for caramels any time.
45743,I once had an 80-year-old grandma give me pennies.  PENNIES.  THE WORST CANDY EVER.
45744,Store bought popcorn balls weren't bad
45745,"Best: Reese's!!! And Whoppers. Man I loved those little rolls of Whoppers, that was the only time I ever got to eat them.

Worst: Either tootsie rolls or Christmas/Easter candy. This one house up our street always handed out shitty, expired candy from other holidays."
45746,Glad to see I'm not the only one that can't stand tootsie rolls. Why would anyone want to eat usually-hard chocolate flavored taffy? Gross.
45747,You can give them to me. I will eat ALL of your Tootsie Rolls.
45748,"The worst is malted milk balls.  The problem isn't that they taste the worst, it's that they're a DIRTY TRICK.  Oh this looks like it's made of chocolate, I'll try it!  NO."
45749,I hate them! Fuck whoppers
45750,...are these like a cheap rip off of British Maltesers? Cause Maltesers are amazing.
45751,Maltesers are awesome <3
45752,I got sick on malted milk balls as a kid. Never again.
45753,"Ha, the news just said the best candy to give out is 3 Musketeers!

I think the worst are those gross peanut butter things that are in orange and black wrappers. I think the Mexican candy (like Lucas and those mango/chili suckers) that gets handed out is pretty gross but my nieces all love that shit.

I need to go get some candy, I think. Is it weird to hand out candy if I don't have any kids myself? I've been in my neighborhood since July and I've seen one toddler and a couple older teens/younger adults. I know there are more kids since a couple school buses come by (and I live pretty close to a school, so close that I can hear the morning announcements if I'm in my backyard).. but I haven't seen any trick-or-treat age kids.

All you weirdos can send me your candy corn, circus peanuts and tootsie rolls!! Nobody hands out circus peanuts but my nieces all give me their candy corn and tootsie rolls. The former is my boyfriend's favorite and the latter is one of mine!"
45754,"It's not weird! Handing out candy is one of my favorite things to do, and I don't have any kids. I love seeing little kids in costumes being all adorable.

I've lived in my house a little over a year now, and last year I got my candy ready and got all excited and turned on my porch light and sat and waited and not a single kid came. I live on kind of a weird side street separate from the rest of the neighborhood, but I know there are a bunch of kids around. 

This year, I still bought candy, and I'm going to put a costume on my dog and turn on my porch light and hope for the best in the cold rain we're supposed to get. I see the same kids every day when I'm walking the dog; part of me wanted to tell them all where I live so they'll come get candy from me, but I also don't want to get arrested so I did not follow through. ""COME TO MY HOUSE, CHILDREN. I HAVE CANDY."""
45755,We moved in to our neighborhood a little over a year and a half ago and our neighborhood is full of kids! We don't have any kids but we pass out candy and love seeing all the kids dressed up! It's also a good way to introduce ourselves to the parents that live on the street.
45756,"I went to Walmart. Found a bag with twizzlers (ew), kit kats, reeses... and mother fucking jolly rancher lollipops. Those were my favorite suckers as a kid and someone on /r/nostalgia recently posted about them so of course I shed a million tears because I thought I'd never get to see them again.. but sure enough! Granted, they are smaller but still. That bag claims 215 pieces so I got one and a bag of 400 tootsie roll midgies. So if no/few kids come I'm going to be happy! I spent a million hours in the Halloween candy aisle overthinking my options. Plus I grabbed a bag of candy corn for my boyfriend, though I practically had to dig for those at target. Walmart only had pumpkin spice candy corn which sounds disgusting, and probably is if they're anything like the pumpkin spice Oreos."
45757,"Are houses on your street decorated for Halloween? If so you'll probably get some trick-or-treaters, whether they're from your street or the surrounding neighborhood."
45758,"Nope, not a single one. I think there are maybe 2 houses in my entire neighborhood that have decorations up."
45759,"Best: Any chocolate.  I don't discriminate.
Worst: Now n' Laters.  They try to be starbursts but only succeed in breaking your mouth."
45761,"That's why they're called that; because you can have most of the candy now, and the part stuck in your teeth for a good long while later."
45762,Laffy Taffy is wayyyy better than Now N' Laters.
45763,"I can confirm the broken mouth thing. Chewing a Now n' Later in fifth grade and suddenly it was crunchy, which seemed odd. It turned into a molar covered Now n' Later."
45764,"Best: Reese's, Milky Way Simply Caramel, Twix

Worst: Good & Plenty, Smarties, Necco wafers"
45765,"You shut your mouth. Necco? I mean, the new ones maybe, but the Classic were my all time favorite candy!"
45766,I won't shut my mouth but you can have all my Necco wafers if you give me all your Reese's.
45767,Deal
45768,"I'd rather munch vitamin c/tums/halls before necco wafers. Like thin sliced sidewalk chalk. 
1. Item
2. Item"
45769,"Best?: all kinds...
Worst?: Good n' Plenty.... Because it masquerades like it's real candy, but it's really just poison."
45770,Good 'n Plenty even has a drawing of poison on the outside of the box. That is clearly what those white pills are on a purple background. Come on.
45771,"Best: kit kat

Worst: peanut butter kisses in the black and orange wrappers"
45772,My mom took a handful of Halloween candy from her work bowl to bring home to me and she said there were kit kats in the bag especially for me. She grabbed reeses instead on accident. They both have a red-orange wrapper so I understand the mistake but I was so disappointed. You don't just promise someone kit kats and then fall through!!
45773,"When I was a kid, someone was giving out cold Capri Sun. It was such an awesome surprise refreshment after wandering around hollaring ""Trick or Treat!"""
45774,"Haha, I'm guessing you don't live in New England. We're lucky if we don't get snow."
45775,"Definitely from Texas, haha. It's usually chilly here but nothing a sweater can't handle."
45776,"Best: Rolo's.

Worst: Spam sandwich."
45777,*Please* tell me there's a story about someone handing out Spam sandwiches for Halloween!
45778,Anything but Halloween taffy!
45779,What is that even?
45780,They're [Mary Janes](http://goo.gl/Vss2m) wrapped in orange and black wrappers. If you're lucky you might get *one* that's actually chewable.
45781,Ew!
45782,My father loves these things! But he can't eat a lot of candy so those are always the last things in the candy bowl when we run low on Halloween candy lol
45783,Never knew what those horrid things were called. Thank you.
45784,"Reese's and butterfingers are the best. Also, people hate on the generic candy in plain wrappers, but the ones with the wrappers that look like a strawberry that are kind of hard on the outside but gooey on the inside are the shit and no one can tell me otherwise. 

Dots are the worst."
45785,"Wish I could upvote twice, once for username and again for understanding that those strawberry candies are the single best use of sugar ever."
45786,"Haha, Reese's and Dots are my two favorites. I like your best and your worst."
45787,"Best: anything name-brand and chocolate

Worst: those awful peanut butter taffoes in the black and orange wrappers"
45788,"Best: Three Musketeers

Worst: **NECCO WAFERS**"
45789,omg those wafers are disgusting
45790,"Best: name brand.  Bonus points for twix.

Worst: that crap with plain wrappers."
45791,"That goddamn peanut butter spackle in the orange and black wrappers.  I think some refer to it as ""taffy"" and I'm pretty sure it was engineered by evil dentists to tear fillings out, break teeth and leave a trail of tears from houses to their offices.  The fact that it's peanut butter appeals to so many but once that glob of hate is in your mouth and you have sunk your teeth in, you realize you made a horrible mistake but there is no going back.  You feverishly chew and chew, hoping to God the pain building in jaw is temporary.  And I don't even know if you can chew that crap into a reasonable pulp.  I think, in my experience, you work up enough saliva to either swallow and pray there aren't any sharp corners left or spit it out.  No one really eats that stuff unless you're in stage five sugar withdrawl and all the good candy is gone.

That stuff is the **WORST**


And the best... Reese's Peanut Butter Cups..."
45792,"Best:  The ""bit-o-honey"" chews. Careful though, they'll rip out a filling. Oh, and those small Hershey chocolate bars.  

Worst: Fireballs.  As a kid, I just couldn't ever enjoy those, and I always seem to get a lot of them.  They slip down to the bottom of the bag, so you don't realize you got 50 of them until your stash is low."
45793,"Oh man, you and I are just polar opposites when it comes to halloween candy haha"
45794,"Best - Rockets!! Diabetes in pill form!!

Worst - Tootsie rolls - chewable roof tar or tire sealant!"
45795,Had to look up Rockets. They're what we call Smarties in the US. Woo! I'm not alone.
45796,"Best: 100 Grand and Snickers

Worst: Peppermint Patties and the candies in the non-descript yellow and red wrappers."
45797,"I always forget 100 Grands. Yeah, they're probably the best."
45798,"Best: Coffee Crisp. I weep for the states for they know not of its deliciousness.

Worst: Those black and orange taffy *things*. Wtf is this shit and why does it taste like a tire."
45799,"There's a place near me that sells Coffee Crisp sometimes. It's true, it's the candy of the gods."
45800,"Just leaving this here:
[The Candy Hirearchy](http://boingboing.net/2014/10/31/the-candy-hierarchy-2014.html)

I for one love Reese Peanut Butter cups"
45801,Where has this chart been all my life!
45802,Worst is circus peanuts. Those orange puffy things that taste like stale crap.
45803,Yum more for me :)
45804,"Worst: Mary Jane

Candy garbage."
45805,Pretty much anything I enjoy EXCEPT Mounds/Almond Joys....ugh.
45806,I like those! Send them to me.
45807,Give me all your Mounds.
45808,"Best: Reese's

Worst: Apples. COME ON, neighbor. Apples are not candy!

Also, Candy Corn.

Basically anything mildly produce-related is sooo not Halloweenie."
45809,My mom is giving our goldfish crackers this year...c'mon mom. Get your shit together.
45810,"I'd take that, actually. Goldfish > crappy chocolate."
45811,"Those disgusting gelatin food-wannabes. Like the hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. http://www.dutchvalleyfoods.com/images/products/detail/pic1/699691.jpg I always black-listed the houses that gave those out."
45812,"Yeah, those are foul."
45813,"Snickers is always the best of everything.  Worst is anything licorice. 

Not a fan of Three Musketeers either, but not the worst to me.  I think your other selections are mighty fine!"
45814,"Best: Hersheys, sour patch kids, crunch, snickers,m&ms...

worst: those strawberry wrapper candy (where do they come from anyways?) and jaw breakers!!!"
45815,"Best: Midnight Milky Way bars. On halloween, they're like the unicorns of candies. My grandmother had those and her house was #2 for halloween pickings on our street.

Worst: Those [strawberry candies](http://cdn.nuts.com/images/auto/510x340/assets/a914dbc3f13e1f1c.jpg) that taste like stale, dusty fruit and seem to appear mysteriously in candy bowls. That's what disappointment tastes like. Or those mini bags of M&Ms--what's the point? They hold like 5 chocolate bits total, that's clearly not enough to surpass even mini chocolate bars."
45816,WORST: I'm surprised no one has mentioned the plague that are DOTS. The teeth sticking ability is unsurpassed.
45817,Best: Butterfinger and Reese's. Worst: Laffy Taffy or fruit flavored candy canes.
45818,PEANUT BUTTER PUMPKINS BEST CANDY. the worst is banana laffy taffy.
45819,"Best: Cherry Blasters or Crispy Crunch bars.

Worst: candy corn and molasses kisses."
45820,Wow. What's a molasses kiss? I like molasses cookies but I think I'd have to pass on molasses candy.
45821,"It's like molasses taffy. I hate molasses, so the candies are a no go. They're usually packaged like [this](http://chowhound.chow.com/uploads/9/6/7/672769_allan_s_kisses.jpg)."
45822,Mmm. I'll make sure to stay away.
45823,Mmmmmmolasses! Love that stuff.
45825,I must be the only person in the world who likes Smarties. They're crunchy and tart.
45826,"I love Smarties! I like most candies that my mom used to refer to as ""pure sugar"". Sweet Tarts, Pez, pop rocks, etc."
45827,"[Canadian Smarties are the shizz.  Like M&M's, only with a better candy shell to chocolate ratio.](http://rateeveryanimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smarties.jpg)  We call those powdery shit candies Rockets, I will only ever eat them out of sugar-craving desperation."
45828,"Best: sixletes I could only ever find them at Halloween until I discovered the candy store at the mall

Worst: gummies, the generic tasteless joke of the candy world. I don't mean like gummy bears, that stuff is delicious I mean the ones that come in clear wrappers and you think that might be marshmallows but aren't."
45829,"Best: Mike and Ike's , Worst: Boston baked beans"
45830,"Best: when you get that two-pack of starburst and both of them are pink




Worst: when you get that two-pack of starbursts and they're both yellow"
45831,"best: pretty much anything with caramel, skittles, or starburst."
45832,"Best:  Butterfinger.

Worst:  The peanut butter taffy that comes in orange and black wrappers."
45833,"Best: Kit-Kat, hands down. I bought a bag of Reese ""mini-bars"" though, for the kiddies, since I ate the entire bag of Kit-Kat that were intended for them a week ago. *whoops* Basically, Reese's are delicious but not enough for me to go on an impulse binge for. What other candies did I love getting as a kid, though? Hmm, Hershey's (but now I know better--Godiva's are the bee's knees) and Snicker's bars. Starbursts in the red/yellow/pink flavors were great too (*but not orange, fuck those to the fiery pits of hell*) and M & M's too. Skittles is a runner up. I wouldn't mind a roll of gummy Lifesavers. OH and I forgot, Airhead's are WONDERFUL!! So are Almond Joy's, Butterfingers, and Crunch. Twix too, and Rolo's. Willy Wonka candy *in general* are nice, especially the pink Laffy Taffy's.

Worst: Dum-Dum lolly pops (except the raspberry ones, if you give out only those I forgive you) or any other small ones, like Tootsie Pops or just the regular Tootsie's. Smartie's... ughhh. I hated those as a kid, such a disappointment. Twizzlers were OK to eat on a regular sugar kick but as Halloween mini candy? Nooope, lackluster. Bubblegum-type candy just made me cringe... and the solid Lifesavers. I remember hating mint candy... doesn't matter if the aforementioned ""Best"" candies also had a mint variation and if you gave those out... I hate you. Mint is evil. Jolly Ranchers are like Twizzlers to me... if you choose them out for a sugar kick, good, but as a surprise candy in the bag? Disappointing. Dot's are awful and so are the licorice stuff especially those candies that looked like pills--forgot the name. Mike and Ike's and Swedish Fish would of made ten year old me cry.  Milk Dud's are meh... so were Nerd's but those were worse because of the annoying way you had to eat them. Obviously, candy corn......... duh.

And if you give out the kids Pez, you are automatically the worst person on Earth."
45834,"The best is anything peanut butter (not so much for my brother though when little, he's allergic), twix, three musketeers, kit-kats, skittles, candy corn. 

The worst are tootsie rolls, those really chewy caramel candies, starburst (sorry, I can't do chewy D:), any type of jaw breaker, and tootsie roll lollipos. Oh and hubba bubba gum."
45835,Butterfingers and Twix!
45836,"Best: Reese's Cups. Followed by Heath bars and Take 5s.
Worst: those orange and black wrapped gross things, candy corn"
45837,"Best: Reese's, Snickers, Almond Joys, who am I kidding...all name brand chocolate is delicious.

Worst: When I was a kid I hated these [strawberry hard candies](http://cdn.nuts.com/images/auto/801x534/assets/a914dbc3f13e1f1c.jpg) and candy corn."
45838,"Best: Chocolate
Worst: Not chocolate"
45839,"HELL YEAH: Snickers, Reeses, gummies (any kind), Twix

FUCK: Tootsie Rolls, candy corn, Twizzlers, Junior Mints, York Peppermint Patties"
45840,REESES ALL. THE. WAY.
45841,"Why does everyone hate those peanut butter taffys so much? :(
I love them! Send them all to me!"
45842,"Best: Kit Kats

Worst: Everything else"
45843,"Worst:

Circus peanuts, candy corn, milk duds. I'd rather have circus peanut/candy corn soup than eat a bag of fucking milk duds."
45844,"Full size candy bars, hit house of the town."
45845,"I order the boxes from Amazon. Some kids try to get more than one and I get pissed at the greedy, ungrateful bastards. Teenage girls showed up and freaked out... *OMG, full size candy bars!* Most are little kids that didn't give a fuck, just mindlessly following parents instructions, I could have been passing out rocks for all they knew."
45846,This year I'm passing out rocks
45847,"Only to small kids who do not know better, with older kids they might get pissed and chuck them at your house."
45848,Big kids get small rocks
45849,"I used to go twice, but only to those houses."
45850,"Well guys I know the thread just started, but lets pack it up"
45851,I pass out pennies...  Each kid gets 2 of them.
45852,You don't sound funny at all.
45853,"Oh, please. No one wants your two cents."
45854,sucks for those kids. Trick or treat is for getting candy...not for getting what you can dig out of the couch cushions.

45864,Snickers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
45865,"Any state near Mexico can get these fairly easily...its a lollipop that is watermelon flavored, and coated with chili powder and dried lemon.  It sounds disgusting, but my god I would give any other candy I had to my friends to procure those bad boys.  They make a similar type with mango instead of watermelon."
45866,Twix have always been my favorite!
45867,"Bake your own rice crispy treats if you have the patience, because then the kids get to have a snack during the long walk that is Halloween"
45868,"My parents never let me eat the things that weren't factory packaged, for fear of razor blades, etc."
45869,Charms Blow Pops Black Ice Flavored. It is a clear lollipop that has black gum inside. Shit is spooky and tasty like a motherfucker. Also hard to find order online.
45870,Anything chocolate.
45871,rolls of floss
45872,Don't give out masturbations ok?
45873,But then what's the point of the floss?
45874,"""Boom full size Snickers! Who does that?! Tell all your friends where you saw that shit. I'll break your fuckin' bag with my candy!"""
45875,"Milky way

Caramel, nougat, chocolate, no nuts just perfection.  In our neighborhood we rarely get more than a dozen or so kids, so we buy a box of like 24 candy bars from Costco and call it good.  Before we moved here we used to go through five bags of candy and still run out before the night was over, so were happy to not be dealing with that anymore!"
45876,"I like those white candy cigarettes. Not the gum ones, but the white ones."
45877,Reese's and Kit Kat
45878,"chocolate was ALWAYS the best candy. Even the small ""fun size"" candy bars were better than non-chocolate candy.

Hard candy was the pits. 

And mary janes were THE worst candy of all."

45886,A can of soda. I got around 3 in one neighborhood.
45887,Toothpaste and apples
45889,Avoid anything fun sized. ESPECIALLY avoid those fruit flavored tootsie rolls. If you buy those you might as well be handing out cough drops.
45890,"Those little treat bags filled with cat poop.

Attention parents: If the house is dark and there's no Jack-o-Lantern outside, please don't send your shitty kids to the door ""just to make sure""."

45900,"I'm doing full sized candy bars this year... (Snickers, Butter Fingers, and 2 packs of peanut butter cups) Why?

Every kids remembers that one house that gave them full sized candy bars every year... And you know what? You never messed with that house... Period... 

Screw brinks... I'm protected by Hershey's.."
45901,"I cover the dogs in fake blood and chain them to a post, one on each side of the yard.

Little boxes, little boxes,
Little boxes, all the same."
45905,"Fuck man, I live near there."
45906,"Oh wow, show me where you live, I'll tell you if I'm close by."
45907,You first.
45908,"No way! I live in Peoria too! Well, one that's south of Chicago..."
45909,"I remember the house that gave these out when I was trick-or-treating as a kid, and that was a good 15 years ago. If I had the funds, I'd do this myself. But since we get too many kids for that to work, I will give out the Reese's instead. I figure that's still a good haul for the kiddies."
45910,"You know who gave full sized candy bars, and not just that, but goodie bags with multiple full sized candy bars?  John fucking Madden's wife that's who.  He was probably traveling to do his next game and wasn't there but his wife was and she was the nicest, coolest lady I have ever met.  She was even dressed up.  I got so much candy from her I didn't bother trying to go back for a second time.  


I never lived near them but one of my friends growing up did so I went to the rich neighborhood to do my trick or treating.  If you ever have the chance to do this for your kids  do it"

45924,A true patriot.
45925,"I fully support two bowls, hidden behind wherever you keep them.  One filled with pleasant nice candies for kids to enjoy and remember your house as the awesome one for trick or treating, and one with shitty generic crap like unlabeled hard candy and knockoff stale chocolates for teenagers who go around without costumes to be sad and stop stealing the fun from the children.  If possible, see if you can find some very low quality store that has really really old candy, maybe from the prior year."
45926,"> and one with shitty generic crap like unlabeled hard candy and knockoff stale chocolates for teenagers who go around without costumes to be sad and stop stealing the fun from the children.

Balmer's chocolate candy, anyone? I always hated receiving those bitter, mealy, foil-covered pumpkin chocolates with the crunch things inside. Yeah, fuck that chocolate."
45927,Kit Kats and the mini crunch bars
45928,"Swedish fish or other gummy things. Yum. 

I had some really rich neighbors once give out 20oz coke bottles. That was pretty awesome."

45930,Nerds!
45931,"Here's the deal.  When I was a kid, people gave me tons and tons of these little caramelized-peanut-butter-things that were wrapped in black and orange wrappers.  They obviously came from some bulk bin, and I thought they were horrible.  When coming home from a trick-or-treating I would throw all the candy on the floor and separate it into piles: box candies, bars, smarties, and no-name things.  Once that was clear, I would further separate the candies into piles according to type: twizzlers went into one pile, m&ms in another, each type of bar fell into its own pile, and smarties stayed in the smarties pile.  At the end of the night I would always have a pile of those orange- and black-paper-wrapped things.  They'd stay in their own pile, uneaten, until everything else was gone.  I'd reluctantly eat them, thinking they were awful and flavorless -- some were smooshy and some crumbled asI chewed -- until they were gone, and it was at that moment that I realized they were the best tasting candy in the bag.  The moment they were gone, however, was also the point I realized I wanted more of that type of candy than of any other candy and I scoured, sniffed, and licked, like a cocaine addict, every spent wrapper for a crumb of faux-peanut-butter sweet.

I can't find them at my local grocery store, and I crave them every October.

I'd like to send a thanks to all my cheap neighbors -- you made a connoisseur of me for those nameless orange and black candies."
45932,"If you live near a dollar tree, they sell them. I still shudder as I go by them!"
45933,"Are you thinking Atkinson's bars?  I say that because I read this story like it was my own.  They are AWESOME.

45940,Now I want a handful of candy corn...
45941,"And that's all I want. I can only eat so much solidified syrup... Well, scratch that, that's pretty much what all candy is. But still, candy corn gets old fast."
45942,"Perhaps, but isn't it good until you get sick of it?"
45943,I love candy corn too.  The best part of being an adult is the ability to do in excess what you loved on rare occasions as a child.
