54314,"Not a joke at all. If you get raw garlic into your blood stream as quick as possible it bumps up your immune system
Way quicker than putting it from pill form
Through your stomach. Don't put vitamin c pills
Up there. What??"
54315,"So whenever we think of vitamin C we all think oranges. Wrong. You want to vitamin c NUKE that cold. So you make a green curry. Lots of coriander, garlic, ginger and chillies. Chillies have got way more vitamin c than anything else. All of them must be fresh.

And then green tea with lemon, ginger and honey. Those two things should help clear up the symptoms allowing you to manage until your body fights it off."
54316,"Or don't catch one to begin with?  Since I started _religiously_ washing hands when in public: before touching my face, rubbing eyes, touching mouth or eating...  Also not touching any possibly dirty (with viruses) surfaces after washing hands and before eating.  Cold viruses can remain viable for a short period of time on door knobs, keyboards, and other surfaces (like several hours). Also if you are around a visibly sick person, be cautious with touching objects and surfaces they touched before you eat or touch your mouth/nose/eyes.

I've found that I don't get sick anywhere as often as I used to.  Ounce of prevention ~= +/- pound of cure."
54317,Or take the Pokemon approach. I caught a ton of colds over a winter DJing in a ski-town. Since then I get hardly any colds.
54318,"If anyone here has a cure for the common cold, there are probably better things to do with it than post it on Reddit. It's literally the go-to example of a Holy Grail for science!"
54319,"don't eat dinner. when you sleep, much of your energy goes to digestion. you want it to go to getting you well instead!"
54320,"Realistically you are not going to ""beat"" a cold in 24 hours, the best you will be able to do is minimise the symptoms.

Your best bet (assuming no allergies) is to treat:
 - Aches
 - Congestion
 - Running nose

Most people reach for OTC cold and flu medications or antibiotics, and while the former will help, the later will do literally nothing.

What works for me is asprin, $1 at the shops and no aches, as for congestion, a steamy shower (or just breath over a bowl of boiling water) will knock out the congestion.

Drink lots of fluids and avoid things that dehydrate you."
54321,"Haven't seen anyone mention this, so I'll add my tip.

Get a [NeilMed sinus rinse bottle](http://be8c5029833240ca9038-8a2c38c8946b4d497918152d3d6bf41f.r27.cf1.rackcdn.com/Sinus-rinse-Ad.jpg) and use it twice a day. This was actually prescribed to me by a doctor because I was getting frequent sinus infections. Not only did it knock those out in a few days (when it typically took me 2-3 weeks to fully recover from them naturally), it also has kept me from developing colds when I first feel the symptoms, or drastically shortened them."
54322,"When you say cold - I'm thinking coughy-stuffy-snot-factory with no fever situation, right?

*DISCLAIMER. I am not a doctor. Talk to a doctor before you go uber stupid with an idea. If you can't breathe? Call 911. If you want to read a suggestion from a ""pantry medic""? you have been warned that this is a random redditor telling you random ideas*

This is a miserable process but works amazingly well.

Take a glass of luke warm water. (You need something not hot because you will drink it fast... and not cold because you will drink it fast)

Add cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp is more than enough for ""damn I'm stuffed with phlegm"" and feel like hell. Start with that. You can up the dose and repeat/up the process if needed)

Drink the funky mixture while standing over your kitchen sink - NO JOKE. DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH CARPET NEARBY!

It will suck going down and in about 2 minutes you will start coughing..... up... shit from.... your toes......  It's not fun. You will hack up boogers that you ate at age 3. You need to do this over your kitchen sink.

The cayenne will dilate the ""tubes"" in your lungs and shit will start moving and sliding and shaking.

If you need to repeat or up the dose? You will know how to modify the home-remedy. You'll know that you need to put in more cayenne or stay at that recipie and try again.....

Take a few hours break before each ""Going to cough everything out of my body that has ever been slimy"" trial.

Best of luck."
54323,"Cold remedy tabs at first sign of cold. Warm shower..inhale steam. Vicks vapo rub in chest. Cover chest. Hot tea with lemon and honey. Salt water gargle with warm water. Sleep with head  elevated. Vitamin c to support immunity..even after you are better. Dairy thickens secretions. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated, thin secretions ..helps with headache too.Try a nasal saline rinse. I use Ocean..it helps with congestion and keeps nasal passages clear.  Once you get better remember to change your toothbrush and wash your linens."
54324,"Now, you *would* be good at parties."
54325,"ITT:  A bunch of loonies and their home remedies.

Might as well just will your cold away."
54326,"And the alternative is...? Go to the doctor and take their antibiotics, or just wallow in self-pity and pressure headaches?"
54327,Take real medicine if you are suffering and let it run its course?  Like everyone else?
54328,"Western medicine is designed to treat symptoms. Mucinex keeps you from feeling mucus buildup. Tylenol reduces your fever. None of these name brand medicines actually improve your overall health.

These home remedies allow your body to purge toxins. Sometimes, by eating the right things and avoiding putting more chemicals in your body, you will feel worse before you feel better. You may have so many toxins in you that it hurts you, at first, to get rid of them (ex: ppl quit cigarettes, then get very sick).

Our OTC medicine is not making our bodies healthier. It is only blocking the symptoms.

Try the home remedies. They are better for you."
54329,"Tons of carbs and proteins.  Eat it and then immediately take some medicine.  If you're home, take the drowsy kind and pass out. 16+ hours of sleep, food, and feeling sorry for yourself and you'll feel better the next day."
54330,"Your immune system weakened to get infected, so you have to strengthen it back up. There's not really a 'fast as possible' way to do this especially if you are already down. Common sense like sleeping well, eating well, drinking a lot of fluids, frequent showers,and staying away from tobacco/alcohol/recreational drugs are the best ways I found for myself but it is only a marginal improvement, maybe 6-8hr faster recovery.

There are *really* good OTC drugs however which will stop runny noses, suppress coughs and negate sore throats. Generally when I use these I neglect the sleeping/showering/eating/drinking phases and a cold I would get over in 3-5 days now last 2-3 weeks with milder symptoms as well as a good hit to the chequebook."
54331,"If you feel a sore throat coming on, mouthwash is actually a great way to keep it from advancing and to keep you from getting a cold. Salt water also works well."
54332,"There isn't really any cheating it. Drink plenty of water, eat properly, sleep properly, don't drink alcohol (or not much) or smoke (at all).Take some medicine that is relevant to whatever symptoms you have. Basically...look after yourself like you should anyway and don't be a wimp."
54333,"boil a cup or two of water with fresh grated ginger, some turmeric, and some cinnamon. Once it has a yellow tinge its good to go. Strain it, add some honey or lemon (or both) and drink up"
54334,"Vitamin C, zinc. Get those into your system as soon as possible"
54335,"Lots of OJ, Nyquil, Vicks Vaporub"
54336,"Jack Daniels and theraflu. Old college cure-all... 

Worst case scenario you won't care that you are sick. 
Best case you are feeling better.

Trust me, I'm some guy on the internet!"
54337,"Best bet, get in bed hot water bottle sweat it out works like a charm for me"
54338,"Zinc, multivitamin, vitamin c, lots of water and NyQuil. Sleep it away. I always wear sweats to bed, the warmer you are the better. If your nose is running uncontrollably use Claritin."
54339,"My best friends mom used to make us a hot pepper and chicken soup whenever anyone got sick. 

Eat the soup. 

Do one shot of tequila. One shot. 

Take a nap. 

Worked every time."
54340,Ginger  tea with honey and lemon. Soup. Vix
54341,Eat your boogers... Develops your immune system to some amazing level since it's all the shit you breath in every day
54342,"A cold is a virus. I'll start with what needs to be said, antibiotics don't fight a cold. 

Drink a lot of water. Get rest. Take a hot shower. Eat hot soup and crackers, drink hot tea with honey. 

In short, a virus will be killed by your body's reaction (someone insert science here). Think of it like a surprise attack, you have to battle it to kill it. The best thing is to be prepared: eat right, wash your hands, get your flu shot."
54343,"To combat colds, my solution is to drink 100% natural freshly squeezed orange juice... mixed with vodka. After a night on the piss, you'll forget you even had a cold with that mother of all hangovers.

Though I do think the orange juice seems to help a bit."
54344,"Wheatgrass.  

3 oz in a single shot.  With an orange slice chaser (no juice because the acidity breaks down the vitamins).

Best early in the morning.  Definitely on an empty stomach because that stuff is rough going down and will be rough going through your guts.  Also tastes like someone hit you with a grass-covered brick in the mouth."
54345,"Cayenne lemon raw honey garlic, hydrate, rest stay warm. Hunnerd butt- loads of Vitamin C-
Plus these fuckin bad boys 
http://sylviesays.com/2010/09/29/wellness-formula/
Seriously, every time I start to get sick, I fill my body with this shit and it doesn't progress."
54346,"Most of these are jokes or sarcasm. 

Here is a legit (works for me but might be  psychosomatic) cure:

Take a clove of garlic. Squish the shit out of it. Put all of it in a shot glass. Fill the shot glass with vodka. Let it sit until bedtime. Shoot the shot and get ready for bed (quickly). Apologize to SO. Bundle up and sweat it out. Apologize to SO. Enjoy feeling better."
54347,"Eat a lemon, including the skin, but not the seeds. It sucks at first but every time I start to get sick I eat one or two, get a good nights sleep and the next day it feels like you're on the tail end of the sickness, or completely better."
54348,"This is going to sound crazy. I normally don't listen to anything without actual research behind it but this worked amazingly well for me.

Boil milk and put a spoon full of tumeric into it. For some reason this has stopped some nasty colds and flus dead in their tracks for me."
54349,"Zinc rapid melt tablets. 

Not the ones that you swallow, but the ones that you let melt and coat your mouth and throat.

I doubt any cold could be cured overnight, but my roommate, a major skeptic of the idea, had to admit that it seemed to help. Supposedly the zinc disrupts the replication of the cold virus where it is most concentrated, allowing your immune system to clear the infection faster."
54350,I had a German roomie who would heat up wheat beer throughout his cold.
54351,"[This.] (http://www.sicklaonh.se/images/nikolai_nasaline/Nikolai_och_Nasaline.jpg) Or something like it (not those weird cups, gravity is not enough to penetrate and flush a seriously cold-clogged nostril).

That one is swedish and is called [Nasaline,] (http://www.nasaline.se/) it's large syringe with a rubber nozzle to send warm, slightly salty water (no iodine) through your sinuses, it cleans out and kills bacteria and viral colonies making camp there. It also guarantees 15-30 minutes of no sniveling runny nose.

No clue if it makes my colds shorter, but it makes them a hell of a lot more pleasant. Together with chewing raw ginger twice a day, eating Echinacea, drinking lots of fluid, lifting/walking in stairs as little as possible, and SLEEPING. Seriously, don't do all-nighter binge gaming when sick, it gives you more days of symptoms on the back end of the cold."
54352,
54353,"Go run a couple of fast miles. If it's a cold, you'll be over it quick. But if it's the flu, you'll feel *really* sick afterward."
54354,"Zinc gluconate (cold eeze). Take it at the first symptom and don't stop taking it until you feel like the cold has mostly gone away. 1 lozenge every 2-4 hours, eat right before you take the next one because they make food taste bad for up to 2 hours."
54355,"Most of these tips are concerned with strengthening the immune system. The problem is, you can't strengthen the immune system in a week. That's why the only proven way to shorten a cold is zinc, which interacts directly with cold viruses rather than by strengthening the immune system to in turn fight viruses.

More than that, cold symptoms are a result of your immune system's fight against the virus. Successfully strengthening your immune system while you are already overrun with cold virus will only make your cold worse before it gets better. You want it strong enough recognize and fight off invaders before the first symptom.

This is how steroid injections in response to a cold work. Steroids work to weaken the immune system in order to suppress cold symptoms, not fight off the cold. This is not something you want to do unless you're both healthy and extremely invested in the upcoming event.

The key is prevention. Improve your immune system ahead of time. Eat your fruits and vegetables. Get vitamin D. Incorporate moderate exercise into your schedule. Wash your hands before eating or touching your eyes, nose, or mouth in public. If using soap, lather for 20 seconds and dry your hands on something clean (not your pants!) Hand sanitizer is your friend as well; Alcohol-based hand sanitizer poses less risk of creating superbugs than the antibacterial soap in most public bathrooms, and is more effective against most bacteria and viruses than soap if your hands are not covered with dirt and grime, just germs. Make sure it's at least 60% alcohol and you use enough to keep your hands wet for 15 seconds."
54356,"Make tea. add juice of half a lemon, lots of raw honey, and a bit of fresh sliced ginger. Symptoms always disappear 50% faster for me than for my friends/coworkers because I use the good ole lemon tea method. I also get a good boost of energy from it, so if I am at home sick and I need to check in with work and answer emails or anything I'll drink the tea right before hand to clear my head. Works like a charm. It's important that the honey is raw, because processed honey loses a lot of its health benefits. If you can get local raw honey at the farmers market, drinking some tea with a tbs of local raw honey can also really help with seasonal allergies (again it has to be local). 

You can also make [SnakeJuice](http://themilkmanswife.blogspot.com/2009/02/homemade-couh-syrup.html) which tastes terrible but works even better than just lemon and honey."
54357,"Nothing works at beating a cold as this: Pour 1 capful from a large bottle of Crest Pro Health mouthwash into the reservoir of a WaterPik and fill it up the rest of the way with the hottest water from your tap. It has to be Crest Pro Health. Other mouthwashes foam too much.

Use the large WaterPik fitting and set the WaterPik at setting 4. Now begin to spray the inside of your mouth deep to your tonsils, under your tongue, and especially the roof of your mouth deep to your throat. Get under your tongue, the space next to your teeth and every where you can reach.

At first nothing much happens. The water/mouthwash solution pretty much is clear. Then as you continue to hit the adenoids and the roof of your mouth way back, small hard white pockets of mucus will be dislodged. This will start to release a huge amount of white mucus from your sinuses and throat and mouth. It will continue and you won't believe how much is released from yourself. Fill the reservoir again and it will continue. The little hard white plugs will diminish and the large globs will continue. Usually two reservoir will clean you out just right. When you finish you will blow your nose and breathe as if you don't have a cold or flu at all. Go to bed and breathe normally without any medication. Next morning do it again and breathe normally all day. Except for being a little run down from your cold you will feel almost normal.

If you snore this will fix it also. Also, if you have a sore throat a tiny amount of blood may be mixed in the mucus but this is from the infected tissue that you cleaned out. Your sore throat will be healed in a day or two and you will feel immediately better.

I had people tell me when they re sick that they may have to take a week off. I tell them about this and they show up for work the next day looking fine. What have I discovered here."
54358,"Rub vapo rub on your feet and then wear socks to bed, it sounds gross but it works"
54359,http://www.snopes.com/medical/homecure/vaporub.asp
54360,I had the worst fever of my life broken instantly by rubbing fresh garlic oils on my feet.
54361,"Zinc tablets.

But don't take them on an empty stomach."
54362,"You are going to be miserable for a whole week or longer, no matter what. You have nothing to lose if you try this: at first symptoms start taking 1000mg (one gram) of vitamin C every hour, -you cannot overdose, look it up-, until you begin to go to the bathroom (diarrhea), after 3 or more doses, cut back to 500mg every hour. Do this for one entire day (24 hours) or until your stomach is fairly empty. Your cold / flu will disappear within 2 days.
Very important: try to eat very light foods: fruits, vegetables; never white flour or any kind of sugar. Do use honey bee."
54363,Build your immune system with probiotics and echinacea.
54364,"People may say you'll just piss out the vitamins but I take a shitload of vitamin C as soon as I start feeling the symptoms of a cold. Too lazy to look it up now but I'll take close to 10 vitamin C pills a day. When you get diarrhea, then you know you took enough. 

In the last 5 years, I haven't had a cold last longer than a day because of this."
54365,Sambucol ! asap tabs and liquid
54366,Magic mushrooms will cure a cold in a few hours.  I don't know why I was down voted for this. it really works.
54367,"Drink an entire bottle of Robitussin DM. If you can handle it, your cold will be gone in the morning.  However, most people have a bad reaction to that high of a dose of DXM, so if you can get your hands on any cold medicine with actual pseudoephedrine, it will make you feel a lot better. Usually you need a prescription. If you live in Alabama, you can get a box of Advil Cold and Sinus with your state ID."
54368,Zinc and orange juice
54369,Drink Much water stay warm
54370,Aqua Control Plus (noncoated)!
54371,Isn't that more like the hien in terms of speed?
54372,"The Hien is noticeably faster. The Aqua Control Plus is one of the most, if not the most, balanced mousepad available in terms of speed and control."
54373,Okay that sounds really good actually thank you. I wanted to order a paracord from lethal anyways so this kills two birds
54374,You mean the black or strata?
54375,Black or white versions
54376,"Some people say Xtrfy GP4 is like a zero. I have the blue one and i'm love with the surface. The glide is smooth and you have ""stopping power"". In almost 2 months since i've got it , I don't see any signs of usage so i assume it's gonna last. ( I hope xD)"
54377,Awesome ty I'll def look into it. And yeah I don't expect any pad to last a lifetime but at a good price and around a year is solid
54378,"They restock quite often, once a week or so. Worth the wait imo."
54379,oh actually wasn't aware of that thx
54380,My Aqua control plus Strata feels EXACTLY like my zero gamer i believe my end game will be the hayate otsu 2020 so u should get that one
54381,zero soft btw
54382,i like using tortillas instead of a mousepad so you could try that i guess.
54383,Solid....with nacho cheese for extra glide
54384,Try out the hayate otsu
54385,Sadly also sold out atm ;(
54386,XL xsoft is in stock
54387,Oh I only looked for soft. Thx I'll check it out
54388,I used Hien for like 2-3 months and I really like my hayate otsu so far. Definitely recommend it :)
54389,"Is there a big diff in speed or control? I know they market it as a ""better hien"""
54390,"Basically just a slower smoother hien, but not slower by a huge amount."
54391,Mousepad worth itself but shipping is problem I. U can check out AC+ from x-raypads I got one myself
54392,The pads are worth but the shipping in EU is horrible and they won't do anything to improve it...
54393,"Between the price, shipping cost, shipping time, availability, duty fees, and lack of customer support, I can't imagine its quality being enough of an improvement to justify it over other high-end pads.

I personally went with it because I like its unique XL length. So the fact its size would be a detriment to you means that you should look elsewhere.

>the same characteristics as an Artisan. 

Different Artisan pads have varying glide properties, so its hard to tell what you mean. But I hear fantastic things about the Aqua Control Plus."
54394,"Um, imo they are kinda over rated. It's not gonna make u a pro. $70 for a mousepad tho is kinda steep. I would get somin else like from xray pad or idk any mousepad. I would be guessing your getting one because of durability, hien for the look, or because u have nothing else to upgrade in your setup. So not really worth it"
54396,"About the AC+, there are about 3 variants to it and I'm confused. There's the white, black and ROB, all different in texture and smoothness. Which one resembles the Hien best?"
54397,"As people said it's mainly the shipping cost that killed it.  Otherwise the mousepad itself is nice but it's not going to be a night and day difference, I'd say it's probably a solid 15% better than your regular mousepad.

That being said, I originally bought Shiden, Hien, and Hayate medium size.  But I realize I never use that big of an area and really don't need that big of a mouse pad, so I switched to Goliathus Mobile Stealth (laptop mousepad) instead.  And at any point I never thought to myself man I miss the Artisan mouse pads.

So my advise is that if you can afford it, I'd say buy one to try it so you've seen the top end of the mouse pad spectrum (more like a life experience thing).  But if not, then it's also perfectly fine to use something generic like Razer Goliathus (like me).  Either case don't sweat over it lol."
54398,best pads on earth. everyone who tells they are not worth it has never tried them or has no clue about pads. end.
54399,"Currently have used the zero soft for 2 months, not gonna lie, it's definitely a step above other pads. I haven't found another pad that feels as nice, however, they are absolutely over hyped and expensive. Honestly theres so many brands out there that you could probably find one that comes close."
54400,"Hien mid mostly sits in the closet, and i use a G-SR as my main.

It's all preference. The Hien is top tier quality."
54401,"It's all preference. They are nice but so are some other brands. I tried about 10 different pads including an artisan zero before ultimately settling with a x-ray pad equate. If it's the right one for you then it's worth the price, but they're not right for everyone."
54402,"They are not.

If youre a serious player who cares about consistency, rank, etc. Or you play in an organized team at whatever level of play, you better be ready to spent 3 weeks retraining your brain to handle the lack of static friction - force required to move. All of their pads sport this feature. Even the zero. 

This amount of speed, or, low static friction gives very little benefit to your gameplay despite feeling like it does. If you're used to a fast pad with low friction, or you grew up playing on a wood desk or something like that, artisan pads will be great for you.

But, if you're like pretty much everyone else who grew up on whatever cloth pad dad brought home from the office, or a logitech or qck, they are not worth it. They are overpriced for what you get.

I'll get hate for this, but the entire mousepad industry is a fucking joke. Anyone can get used to and play well on any surface given time. All of this marketing, all of these different surfaces? Bullshit.

All of these people swapping pads around cuz x y z? Self doubt. A pad isn't gunna save your accuracy bro. Playing the game day in and day out will. Practice. Hours. Not the mousepad.

Buy whatever mousepad is made well and has decent durability for a good price and call it a day."
54403,"Preach! But I don’t hate on the hobby. I’ve only owned a Qck and Razer Gigantus v2 but I think buying a nicer mousepad can be a nice quality of life increase. I don’t think it’ll magically make you a better aimer.  

Once again nothing wrong with upgrading your experience especially if you spend a lot of time on it. But don’t expect it to magically make you better."
54404,"That's what I'm sayin. Get something that's of good build quality, looks good on your desk and your skin appreciates. Nothing wrong with that.

All this friction force and grams bullshit is just too much. I felt like I had to say my two cents lol"
54405,I was totally fine with the OG gigantism for 4 years until I finally splashed on an otsu and honestly the improvements were marginal but nothing to yell about
54406,"I found the artisans jarring. My wide screen or half screen flicks in valorant / cs were fine. But the micro adjustments during pistol rounds or spray transfers was like holding a high pressure fire hose on my own with one finger. 😂

I did eventually get used to it but ultimately went back to slower pads. That control when shit hits the fan and you need to spray transfer a 3rd guy with 3-4 bullets left is just too nice."
54407,Artisan is just higher quality. You won't find another pad with lower stitching and the rubber base sucks itself to your desk. But these are comfort things. If you're not into spending extra for a premium experience then you shouldn't get an Artisan.
54408,"they are hyped but honestly for some reason. im not gonna lie: the zero is the most perfect pad for me. and i tried ALL. if you want to have the most premium pads, go for artisan. none of the other brands are coming close to this quality."
54410,I don't have to justify anything. It's my money and I like to have nice things.
54411,"Yes but I think the skypad 2.0 is better on every aspect literally lasting a lifetime . I guess you are playing slow paced games like cs and val so the skypad might not be for you and yeah artisan mousepads are gonna last for a few years and the quality is top notch, it’s really worth buying over all the  standard mousepads."
54412,The only real option from artisan is the Zero. Theres an artisan guide on the spreadsheet if you want more in depth.
54413,Hoya's one?
54414,"I use to have a glorious X3L as well. I recommend the GSR-SE or Aqua Control +. The Aqua Control + will be better for you if you like the extra size. They’re both control pads and just a bit slower then the Artisan Zero. If price is a problem for you, you can get an inked pad. Hope this helps!"
54415,Thank you man. The GSR-SE is sold out but I definitely wanna look into the aqua control+ or the inked pad
54416,"Try the Inked. I compare it similar to a Gigantus V1. They both have slower glides than the Zero. The stopping power on them are all comparable, but imo the faster glide on the Zero makes the stopping power feel lower for my very low sensitivity.

I would give a go at the Inked Pad or V1. The largest non-extended Inked Pad is 460mm x 400mm (pretty equal to a QCK/Glorious) so get the V1 if you want something just slightly bigger."
54417,Important note that the g sr se loses its glide in about 6 months
54418,"is there any thing other than artisan and zowie, they are so hard to get"
54419,if you were gonna get artisan zero mid then yeah gsr se is best one out there thats similar although wont last as long
54421,Aqua control + or inked pad :)
54422,Razer Gigantus v2
54423,"Hello all!

I currently own the top 5 artisans out there...

Zero, 
Hayate Otsu v2, 
Hien, 
Raiden, 
Shidenkai

The Raiden and shidenkai are mid and the others are soft. I have used zero xsoft and otsu xsoft as well as mid so I have a good idea of a lot of softness variation.

In descending order...

Speed - shidenkai, Raiden, hien, otsu v2, zero

Control - zero, otsu v2, hien, Raiden, shidenkai

That seems opposite, and it is, but not quite that black and white. For instance, otsu v2 is just about as fast as hien and as much control as zero, that's why it's so popular! 

In terms of durability, they're all insane minus the shidenkai. I've owned zero and hien the longest (about 5 months) and they're still nearly new! Granted, I rotate pads a lot, but no joke they just don't wear down! The otsu v2 I've owned for about 3 months and it also feels brand new! I'm guessing they fixed the otsu v1 issues. Raiden and shidenkai are the newest. I've had them about a month, Raiden seems like it will last forever. Shidenkai does get a few stray bead shards from time to time so I imagine it will wear down faster than the others, but I used it for two weeks straight and it still basically feels brand new. 

Some other notes... 

Otsu v2 has the most comfortable surface, it's really unique. Shidenkai is probably the most fun, so smooth! Raiden is very soft and I've had no spinouts (800 dpi and I've used 7 different new mice on it). Zero does get hair stuck in it from time to time and a lint roller works great. Hien is better broken in a bit. 

Soft is my favorite density, xsoft is great if you like a tad more control, mid is best for the fast pads (Raiden and shidenkai). 

Ordering from their website is very easy, I can walk anyone through it if needed. 

I use a Logi GPX SL, XM1R, Xtrfy M42, Hati S, Viper mini, and HyperX Pulsefire Haste in rotation on these pads and every combo has been amazing! 

Any other questions, don't hesitate to ask! I spent a ton of money so might as well share the knowledge!"
54424,"I’ve got the hien and zero. Do you think I’m missing out on much when it comes to the new otsu? I switch between the hien and zero depending on what game I’m playing, but it would be cool if the otsu is the perfect middle ground"
54425,"Honestly those two cover most everything outside of super speed like shidenkai.   They were my first two and I only kept going cause...I have problems lol.  But otsu v2 is basically a good mix of the two and more of a plush surface.  It's nearly as fast as hien and close to the control of zero, but zero has more control and hien has more speed if you want one of those categories to be ""maxed out""."
54427,If I am I just getting into mousepads do you think the the otsu v2 is good starting point opposed to a zero or hien?
54428,"Zero is going to be more similar to what you're accostomed to from any other cloth pad. It's your safest route into artisan. If you want the best quality ""safe pad"", it's the zero.

Now if you want to experiment a bit with something really unique, both otsu v2 and hien are fantastic! They'll be a touch faster than you might be ready for, but you'll adjust and likely love it!

Now if you're looking for something really fast and want to play it sort of safe, go raiden, or if you want to experiment with tons of speed at the cost of durability, but want to have fun, and try something very unique, try shidenkai 😉."
54429,"I have a mid hien, soft zero and hayate otsu v2. I swear to god my Zero is faster than my hien? Not really sure what is going on with it. 

I've read that Artisan has recently shipped out wrong pads to people? IDK."
54430,"You'd know if it was hien. Hien has a rougher surface than all the others. Hien is def faster than zero, so that's odd."
54431,"My hien was my first pad, just received the zero and hayate otsu v2. I can tell the hayate b/c the surface is sort of like the Hien, but I swear to god the zero is faster. A gentle flick on my Hien gets it from edge to center, same flick more or less pushes my mouse off of the pad altogether."
54432,"Interesting! I might have to swap back to my zero to try again
It's been a long time since I messed with it."
54433,"Hey man, I’m thinking of buying the Hayate Otsu V2 to replace my HyperX FuryS speed mousepad, do you think that it will be well worth the upgrade and money spent ? Tnx in advance"
54434,"Yes! I'm like boardzy... I think artisan is always an upgrade. I've messed with a ton of other pads and every time there's an Artisan that's better. 

Aqua control, I'm happier with hien. QCK or GSRSE... I'm happier with zero. Glorious Ice, I prefer shidenkai. Raiden and otsu v2 seem to be unique, haven't noticed many similar ones out there to compare to those."
54435,"> Raiden and otsu v2 seem to be unique, haven't noticed many similar ones out there to compare to

Have you tried the (coated) Aqua Control+? IIRC it has similar properties to what you describe in the Otsu V2, and I'm curious about where the comparison would fall."
54436,"The ac+ I have is the coated one. The orange and blue one. Although I like it, it might actually be my favorite non artisan pad, it's definitely not the otsu v2. The otsu v2 has a very different feel and is extremely unique. Honestly the ac+ coated is most similar to the hien IMO."
54437,Which one has smoother glide and softer feel on the arms? Is it the Otsu v2 or the Zero?
54438,Otsu v2 is smoother and a little faster.
54439,"Tnx, can you tell me about the stopping power between the two?"
54440,"Zero stops a tad better. About 10/10 stops on zero and 9/10 on otsu v2. For me, the otsu is plenty of stopping, but that's cause I'm now used to Raiden and shidenkai speeds and low stopping forces."
54441,"How about the Hien’s stopping power compared to the Otsu V2 / Zero? I have the Hien, for about 2 weeks now, but I feel the need for more control when it comes to games like VALORANT. I’m debating on Zero as I already have the Hien and need control, but I’m scared of the possible uncomfortable speed that comes with the Zero as I’m used to faster speeds (only used to fast pads, Glide and Hien, never used QcK or GSRSE or anything)"
54442,"What's the slowest of the bunch?  I'm a CS player, and have used the Zowie GSR and Gigantus V2, but have been looking at artisan pads because of the durability/longevity.  Do any of them even have the stopping power for tac shooters or should I look elsewhere?

EDIT: currently using a Viper Ultimate @ 800 dpi, 1.05 in game sens."
54443,"The zero and probably the otsu v2 are your best bet for good control with the zero being a ""premium"" upgrade to the gsr. I play cs and valorant with all five pads, but zero and hayate otsu v2 have the best control."
54444,"What would you say are the biggest differences between the two?  I've seen a fair amount more about the zero, almost nothing about the otsu."
54445,"Zero has a slight edge in control while otsu has more speed. Otsu is also a little more comfortable IMO.

Durability for the otsu v1 was an issue, but myself and other otsu v2 owners seem to agree that they must've fixed it because I have no issues."
54446,"Awesome.  I might try to get both of them once they're in stock to try out, and then sell off the one I don't like.  Out of curiosity, what sens are you using for CS/Valorant (and are you using that xtrfy mouse for both)?  Also, what are your favorite mass market pads you would say are close to each?"
54447,"Dpi is 800 and my valorant sens is 0.32, csgo is 1.00. I use a handful of mice on rotation an rotate through all five artisans. So lots of combinations! Keeps it exciting and new!

Favorite mass market pad.. Hmm does aqua control plus count? I honestly don't know... What qualifies a pad as mass market? Logi and razer pads?"
54448,"the us version of the store doesn't seem to be working for me right now but what hardness do you recommend? (between xsoft, soft, mid)"
54449,"Hello, thank you for your overview of the pads. It's really helpful. I've got some questions about density of the pads.

Does density affect durability? Is soft more durable than xsoft? 

Why do you prefer soft when xsoft gives more control?"
54450,"Hi there!

I don't believe density affects durability, but I'm not positive. It does in one case with the shidenkai as xsoft causes more creases in the bad wearing down the glass beads faster. This is why mid is recommended for shidenkai.

In terms of soft vs xsoft, xsoft does give a touch more control. I had zero and otsu v2 in xsoft and really like both. The only reason I prefer soft to xsoft is that I still get nearly the same control, but my arm doesn't sink into the pad as much. I found I'd get a little too hot on the xsoft versions.

Hope this helped!"
54451,"I want a medium size Hayate Otsu. The only thing stopping me from pulling the trigger is the xsoft versus soft. What is the real difference between the two? Does Xsoft sink in with regular pressure? I don't think I want my wrist to noticeably depress into the pad, but I do want it to be comfortable.

To be clear, I don't even use a mouspad right now. I play on the wood surface of my desk. I also use 4400 dpi and don't want to make large movements with my hand, if that helps."
54452,"Oh wow 4400 dpi?! What games do you play? That's insanely fast!

Xsoft does not depress unless you start pushing in a bit. Soft depresses with a little more force. They're both extremely comfortable. If you're a fingertip grip it won't matter, if your palm or claw you could go either way, but soft might be preferable if you have a heavy hand.

For me, I rest my arm on the pad from time to time and it would distract me when I sink in a bit, so soft worked better, but xsoft was totally doable."
54453,"The dpi was an accident. I have two dpi adjustment buttons on my Razer Naga mouse, and had accidentally turned it all the way to maximum (8200 dpi) and just got used to it for a period of years. I didn't realize that was fast until I was talking to a friend about a new mouse/mousepad last week, which was when I cut it back to 4400 - less feels very sluggish to me for the moment. I'm going to try to move myself down to a more realistic setting, which hopefully the added control from a good pad will help with. Fun fact since I'm talking about it, my total range of motion with my mouse was about half an inch to cross both monitors.

 I play mostly stuff like Path of Exile, Hades, and some League. Shooters I always swap to controller for, bad habit from my xbox days. Also probably because it's very difficult to have stable aim on 8200 dpi. 

I think based off what you've said I'll go for the soft and see how that plays out."
54454,"Yeah with that dpi you'd spin around 5 times for moving half an inch lol. Makes sense you didn't notice based on your games and that you use a controller. Also makes sense why you only need medium, so that's a plus!

Yeah I prefer soft, but I also like xsoft. Mid is my least favorite except for Raiden and shidenkai."
54455,"How is the speed/control of the zero compared to the new Hayate Otsu? Also, how long have you had the otsu V2 and has it worn down at all?  


I've been using the Otsu v2 and i absolutely love it, but was wondering if i should try a zero before i decide that this is my main paid. I loved the hien but i just found myself overshooting ever so slightly."
54456,"Zero has only a touch more control over otsu v2. I'd say 5/5 control for zero and 4.5/5 for otsu v2 on control. Speed for otsu I'd give a little over 3/5 whereas zero is a solid 2/5. Otsu v2 is basically hien speed with comfy surface and more control than a hien 👍.

I'd say try zero only if you want a bit more control."
54457,Yeah i think im gonna stick with the Otsu for a while and if it wears down then i'll go to a zero but tbh it just feels so perfect in every way lol
54458,"Totally agree, enjoy it!  I keep rotating to it much more than the other pads :)."
54459,What numbers would you give the Hien soft on this scale?
54460,"Hien is probably a 3.5/5 for control and dang close to a 4/5 speed. At least for me... Sometimes I'm about a 4/5 control on it, but I lose a bit of control with hien."
54461,"How’s the durability of the otsu v2 vs the zero/hien?

Also, what would you recommend to someone who’s never used an artisan pad? (I’ve only used control pads, mainly the qck heavy and logitech g640). Thinking of buying an artisan real soon"
54462,"So far otsu v2 durability has been fantastic! Same as zero and hien. Raiden is also in that category.

I'd say if you like control and don't want to get too wild with your first artisan, the zero is perfect! Very safe artisan to start with!"
54463,"Last question, would switching to something a bit faster like the hien be a bit too drastic of a change for me? Kinda torn between sticking with what I know and trying something new."
54464,"Not really. A little adjustment, but you'll get used to it. Also depends on what you play....faster stuff like cod or apex you might really enjoy that added speed and tracking! More tactical and slow shooters like cs, valorant, and R6 it'll be more of an adjustment, but you'll get there. I'm more on the tactical side myself and I adjusted all the way to shidenkai! Just takes some practice."
54465,"Thank you so much! I’ll keep this into consideration. Suuuper hyped to get my own artisan pad. Amazing review, u are awesome!"
54466,No problem man!
54467,I went from a worn muddy GS-R to a hien mid. I understand your concern but if you wanna try some speed then nothing is stopping you! You'll get used to it
54468,Thanks friend!
54469,Yeah no problem! You'll be happy
54470,"I’m in the same boat as u/kjuy14 I’ve only ever used qck heavy, Logitech g40 and Zowie gsr. Do you recommend soft or medium firmness?"
54471,"Soft... Mid isn't great IMO. It makes the pad a bit too fast and hard to dig in. Also the grip doesn't work as good in the mid. I only recommend mid for Raiden and shidenkai cause those are fast anyway.

For hien, otsu v2, and zero, def go soft or xsoft."
54473,Hand size? Been looking at m42
54474,"I am 17.5x10cm. I use a relaxed claw grip. The m42 is very narrow and about the same length as an xm1. I really like it! Superior build quality 👍. Worst part is the cable, but if you get a paracord in then the worst part is out of the way."
54476,"Not bad, remove the feet, unscrew, open and be careful of any ribbons, take out old cable, place in new one, screw back together, put on new feet. Now if you have a cable from lethalgaming or wparacords with a 3d printed stress relief you're good to go, but if you get a ""standard"" paracord from somewhere like dreamcables you'll need to heat shrink wrap and size it up. It's honestly not too hard and dreamcables make fantastic cables, plus you can generally always get them in stock whereas lethalgaming only drops cables once a week that sell out fast and wparacords is a bit backlogged."
54477,I play a lot of apex what pad would you recommend?
54478,"How much speed do you want? My gut says hien cause that's a faster game, but if you want even more speed then Raiden or shidenkai."
54479,"First off thanks for the great review, cleared up some things for me. One question I do have is how does the glide of the raiden compare to that of the otsu v2? I am currently deciding whether or not I want to try out a v2 but I also really love the raiden's glide and I wouldn't want to lose too much of that. I just want to confirm with someone who owns both pads before I pull the trigger on a new otsu v2. Thanks in advance"
54480,"I'd say the Raiden glide is like 4/5 and otsu v2 is probably a touch over 3/5. It's still a good glide, not quite Raiden, but it has much better control 👍."
54481,"Nice collection there! My first artisan pad (Hien soft) is coming in the next 2 ish weeks and have a few questions 

1. I’m coming from a pretty worn down QCK+ around 2 and a half years old, is the Hien going to feel like ice in comparison. I’ve literally only used the QcK for my pc gaming life so I really have no frame of reference to how fast the Hien is going to be.
2. I’ve got the viper mini with stock feet and cord (I have never nodded any mice before but could be getting into it potentially, slightly harder because of where I live but anyways) how do they perform on the Hien?
3. I know this is a standard question but if you had to main one mousepad for the rest of your life which mousepad would you choose?"
54482,"Thank you! Love this collection. Grats on your future hien, you'll love it!

1. The hien is going to be a good bit faster than what you're used to. IMO you'll adjust rather quickly and the low static friction will be a fantastic upgrade for your tracking ability. The stopping power will be a bit of an adjustment, but muscle memory will kick in eventually.
2. Viper mini with stock feet might be a little scratchy on hien, at least mine was. Swapping to core pads was really helpful on my viper mini. I think they're in stock on lethalgaming gear and it's by far the easiest mod as you just peel off the stock ones, clean the surface, and add the new pads. That being said, it's very usable, just a bit scratchy. 
3. The hardest question! It was the hien for a long time, but hayate otsu v2 took the crown though I love all 5!"
54483,"Hien will feel massively faster. You will have to lower your sens 20% or so.

You will become aware of how bad your mouse control is, and may have to aim train to fix it."
54484,What mouse do you prefer? XM1r or Superlight and why?
54485,"Oof hard question! Right now it's very close, but I give the slightest edge to xm1r cause that's my all time favorite shape! I'm a relaxed claw kind of guy 👍. The gpx is so insane though!"
54486,"Very interesting response.. What do you aim best with even tho you prefer xm1r shape more?

Thanks"
54487,I actually aim best with xm1r as well! Though only slightly. I do really well with all my mice in rotation.
54488,top man thank you legend!
54489,For low sensitivity CSGO/Val - zero soft or xsoft?
54490,"So I also do cs and Val... But I use all these for it. Personally, I like soft just a touch more as xsoft is definitely usable, but for me my arm tends to sink into the pad a bit too much."
54491,Interesting. I was planning to get xsoft until i read your comment. Whats your sensitivity in cm/360?
54492,"Ohh not sure with that metric... But I use 800 dpi and 0.32 sens in valorant if that helps. I try my best to not adjust these when swapping pads, but to just remember off of muscle memory. TBH I might play a hair better by sticking with one pad always, but that's not as fun and I play to have fun 😁👍."
54493,"Thats 51 cm/360 :) its just an easier way to compare sensitivity across different games. My sens is quite close to yours so looks like my arm will sink in too 🤔

Btw if you could only have 3 mousepads, what will they be?"
54494,"I think the arm sinking is more if you lean your forearm into the table or not. I have a sit/stand desk, when I'm standing my forearm isn't too bad and xsoft is fine, but when I lower it I use a kneeler to sit and I tend to lean in a bit too much.

Three choices... Hmm... My top 3 would be otsu v2, hien, and shidenkai. I love zero, but I think otsu gives me all the control I need and I love Raiden, but if I want to go super fast the shidenkai is more fun. That being said... It's extremely hard to narrow that in!

Hell I'll give you my favorites in order... Otsu v2, hien, shidenkai, Raiden, zero. Zero on bottom might surprise some people, but I really think otsu v2 does the control just about as good and that's the best thing about the zero. Other thing to keep in mind... I'd rate the zero a 9/10 pad lol... It might be my lowest, but they're all s tier pads and the others are beneath them IMO."
54495,"Ooh i shall give xsoft a shot then! I normally raise my chair when gaming so that my forearm is able to move more freely. Yeah im surprised that zero is your least favorite since its a popular mousepad. I was intending to get otsu, hien and zero actually hahaha. I shall reconsider my choices 🙃 Thanks for the ama! This is really helpful"
54496,"Sure! Those three are honestly still great choices! If you don't want a ton of speed, but have to pick 3 artisans, I'd take those three. Only reason to go with Raiden or shidenkai is that if you really want to mess with a lot of speed. The hien is still quite fast, so if you want to explore some speed without going nuts, otsu v2, hien, and zero are all awesome!"
54497,awesome. and which is your favourite of all the pads for those games?
54498,"Right now the otsu v2 is my overall favorite, but I'm having fun with all the pads!"
54499,"Offtopic but, out of those mice that you own, what is your favorite to least favorite in terms of aiming. I have the viper mini and haste, but the xmr1, m42, and hati-s are on my radar and was wondering what you thought since you own the other 2 that I have."
54500,"With the mice it's subject to hand size and grip style. I'm 17.5x10cm with relaxed claw. If I was to order them...

Xm1r, GPX SL, M42, Hati S, Pulsefire Haste, Viper Mini.

Truthfully those are a lot closer than just ordering them shows. For instance, M42 and hati s are likely equal.

Pulsefire is phenomenal, like one of the best mice for the price I've seen as is viper mini. They just both are slightly off my hand shape/grip style enough to put them a little behind, but not by far."
54501,"Interesting, i also have pulsefire ahead of the viper mini, i didnt like gpro superlight shape. But im super intrigued by hati s and xm1r"
54502,Xm1r is the peak IMO. For my relaxed claw it's supremely comfortable and the mouse quality is insane! If they come out with a mini and/or wireless it's insta buy for me!
54503,Have you used any Novelkeys or Dixie Mech/Omnitype desk mats? That’s what I currently use and was looking to see which Artisan was essentially a better version of it. I tried a worn GSR-SE from a friend and played way worse with it for reference lol. 800dpi .4 sens in Valorant
54504,"Hey, first of all huge thanks for your commitment to the community.
Shidenkai question here.
I've had Shidenkai mid for half a year now, put lexip's ceramic feet on my mice and now the pad's speed has become significantly slower. I used it with care, even put it away for surfing or working and used just for gaming. Now the glide is smooth as usual but definately slow.
Even applying pledge polish now doesn't give that same effect as it did in the beginning.
Maybe its the ceramic feet that weared out the glass coating over time? Or maybe i didn't make a proper clean of the pad from the collected skin sweat. I usualy clean it with monitor cleaning spray and a microfibre cloth."
54505,"So mine hasn't worn down, but I have a ton of pads. I've probably only put a few weeks into it. I do hear shidenkai does this though, it'll slow down a good amount over time. That's the drawback to it unfortunately.

If you want to avoid that try the Raiden! It's nearly as fast and has much better durability!"
54506,"Thanks for your reply. Yeah, I had a coversation about this issue with another shidenkai user, and we came into a conclusion that its my ceramic feet that may have worn out the glass surface. I've ordered now hien soft to try smth different."
54507,"Quick question, how does the otsu V2 compare to the Corsair mm300?"
54509,I wish they were in stock :(
54510,"I find all the artisans come back in stock quite a bit if you're patient.  Follow ""isartisaninstock"" on twitter, he seems good with giving the notifications for the ""big three"" (otsu v2, zero, hien).  

If you want Raiden and Shidenkai they almost always seem to be in stock, at least last time I checked."
54511,"I know, I just really want to try the zero or otsu. Hien soft is a little too fast for me, especially after I found my love for control pads (I tried the GSR and really enjoyed it)."
54512,">isartisaninstock

i cand find any twitter page with this name"
54513,Sorry search for @IsArtisan
54514,"Thanks for the review.  I'd love a recommendation if you don't mind.

I currently own the Hien (soft) & Raiden (mid).  I was debating ordering the Hien in mid to try but after seeing the new Otsu v2, that has caught my attention.

Otsu v2 worth giving a shot? Wonder how different it would be in mid vs soft.  Thoughts?"
54515,"I had otsu v2 in every softness! I found mid to be quite fast, not very cozy and I wasn't a fan. Xsoft is very nice, but got my arm a little sweaty sometimes due to just sinking in. Soft was just right for me.

If you want to try something a little slower, but with more control and something unique, otsu v2 is awesome! If you really want to slow down, then go zero 👍."
54516,"I own the raiden mid, should i get the hien? Whats your opinion about the hien?"
54517,Does the otsu v2 get lint stuck in it like the zero?
54518,"Nope! Zero seems to be the one that attracts lint, hair, etc, the most."
54519,Im literally stuck b/w the hien and otsu v2 ahhhhh. Which one is more durable?
54520,"Hard to say... Likely hien is more durable, but that's just cause people have had them for a couple years and still going strong! We just don't have the data for the otsu v2 yet, but I can say it's very durable.

They're both insanely good pads and my top 2 overall."
54521,"I got the Raiden Mid maybe a year or so ago, still feels like new, I'm never buying any other pad but Artisan pads again."
54522,"Yes! This has been me as well! I got a bunch of pads, then tried hien and zero and decided to stop buying other pads. I eventually tried the glorious ice and decided to just get shidenkai to see the difference... For me the shidenkai blows it out I'd the water! I'm an Artisan for life fan 👍!"
54523,"Hey! First thanks for the review!

I'm looking to upgrade to an artisan soon. I've mostly used the CorsairMM300 for 2 years and the g640 for a  it over a year. I like the control of both but I definitely want a bit more speed while keeping some control since I play some tracking oriented games too (Val/Apex)

Would be using it with my viper mini (tiger ace 1 feet and paracorded with a bungee)

Would the zero or hien fit the bill? In soft or mid?"
54524,"Wow I used the mm300 for years before I started really experimenting about a year ago!

So zero is your safe pick, but IMO if you want a little more speed and want something more unique, try otsu v2 or hien. A little more comfort and control go for otsu v2, and for a little more speed do hien."
54525,"Great minds!

Thank you so much for the answer+ I will probably pick the hien or otsu v2 a try then! 

Been hearing a lot of great things about the other lately!"
54526,I have an aqua control+ and I’m looking to get a new pad here soon. I really enjoy the feel but would like a touch more speed. I like the stopping power of the ac+.
54527,"I have ac+ as well. It was the last pad I liked before taking the dive into artisans.

I'd say the hien is a good option for a touch more speed while still keeping control. Once you hit Raiden, you give up on the control more and forget any control on shidenkai. But if you're ready for crazy speed, feel free to try that tier 😉."
54528,"No no I like control lol. I just would like a touch more speed. I was interested in the hien before I bought this but I’m not sure if I want that one because I’m worried about stopping power not being a thing, thoughts?"
54529,Hien still has pretty good control. I think you'd be ok going from ac+to hien.
54530,Ok cool. Thanks a lot!
54531,"Great review. I think hien and zero are restocking in my country soon. But maybe the hien comes in mid and xsoft only. Really tempted on hien red wine since it looks soooo good paired with white mice. Hope it comes in soft! Questions

* 1. How would the zero soft and hien mid or soft compare to the hyperx furys and control? I have these 2 pad for 3 and 2 years now."
54532,"So I never owned the hyperx fury and control. Hard for me to say, but I imagine they're in the same speed/control range of zero as many other pads as are.

Zero soft is going to be your safe pick into artisans and my personal recommendation if you can't get hien in soft. Hien mid becomes a bit too rough and loses some control from soft and xsoft from what I hear, so zero soft is your best bet for those choices.

Hien xsoft might work too, I just never tried it at that density."
54533,Thanks for your input. Not to mention that the hien mid tends to slide on the desk as others have stated. Guess ill just have to see whats in stock. Fingers crossed that the hien comes in soft and red.
54534,Yes! I forgot to mention that. Mids do have issues with sticking on the desk.
54535,"With all the hype around xsoft recently, I was debating in between a soft or xsoft otsu v2. 

With that being said I am a light fingertip gripper and I have a hien mid and i have a tough time slowing down and was wondering if I could benefit from the extra squish?

Anyways I would love to hear your thoughts"
54536,"I honestly really like both soft and xsoft. The xsoft is very cozy, it just is a little too squishy for my tastes as it seems to make my arm a bit warm from sinking in.

Honestly you can't go wrong with either soft or xsoft otsu v2."
54537,Do you think i'd benefit from xsoft though? I'm interested in trying to dig my fingers in to stop
54538,"Yeah that's what it's built for! Provided you don't really lean in, you'll be fine! Plus for fingertip you're not really leaning in much anyway. Give xsoft a shot!"
54539,How much faster is a shidenkai over a raiden? Any hard pads to compare to?
54540,"Good question! Shidenkai is definitely faster and smoother, but if you're looking for a lot of speed and durability the Raiden is perfect.

I don't use hard pads so can't compare."
54541,"Hey Bro great review! I recently bought a artisan Hien FX in Soft brand new  but I noticed that my top right corner isn't as grippy as the other corners Do you have this issue? I made sure to clean my surface for maximum grip, also how do you clean these mousepads?"
54542,"To your desk? That's weird... I haven't had an issue like that. Might just not be super flat there?

I do usually play on top of a deskmat though, so I haven't gotten to mess with the grip too often, but I have tried them directly on the desk.

I know the mids don't grip as good, but a soft not gripping is strange..."
54543,"yeah I think I  have a theory on why my top left corner of the pad doesn't want to grip but I do not know if that could possible play a factor 

Theory: so When I first got the mouse pad there was a bunch of papers on my desk and I think I accidently placed my pad over that stack of paper. That  paper stack was so high it lifted that corner up exposing it to air causing drying.

But I don't know if this could possibly play a factor to it This is my first time picking up anything other than a cloth pad. Also any tricks or tips on how to make that side 'grippy' or ‘sticky’ again. Its honestly not much of a problem it just bugs me a lot  but I don’t notice it in everyday use, the pad is fine. Thanks for reading!"
54544,Only thing that helped me with the mids to stick better was putting a little water on the desk underneath the pad. Could try that...?
54545,Gotcha! ill give that a try thank you :)
54546,"Will the model o wireless spin out on raiden?
Pls tell me"
54547,"I never got to use it on that, but I haven't spun out with any of my mice on the Raiden. I have tried 7 different mice on it, most 3389, a 3370, hero sensor, and a 3335. No spinouts."
54548,"Hello! What would you recommend to someone who’s new to artisan mousepads but plays a lot of FPS like R6, valorant, overwatch. Thanks!"
54549,"R6 and valorant are more control while OW is a faster shooter. IMO if you don't mind a little speed I'd try hayate otsu v2 or hien, soft or xsoft."
54550,What pad would you call your “favorite” based on the games you play? :)
54551,"They're all amazing, but overall favorite is otsu v2 with hien as my second favorite and ""most fun"" is shidenkai, hopefully shidenkai doesn't loose that glide too quick!"
54552,Thanks for answering my questions dude! You’re amazing and your review is very insightful. Have an awesome day!
54553,No problem! Thanks for reading!
54555,"No way! You're going to love the otsu v2! IMO it's the best of both the hien (speed) and zero (control). You're probably missing just a hair of speed the hien can offer, but that difference is very minimal yet you're gaining a good amount of control!

What density did you choose?"
54556,"Sick!! I got the soft, though I'm curious about the xsoft I'm worried that I won't be able to sell such an expensive pad in the aftermarket. Seems like soft is the popular option so I went with that.

What differences did you notice between xSoft and Soft for the Hayate Otsu ?"
54557,"You'll be able to sell, just might have to eat a little cost due to shipping and overall prices. I sold my otsu v2 mid and xsoft as well as the zero xsoft on the market, but had to take a little hit with all of them. Still worth it to try them at least for me.

Xsoft has more cushion. It's super cozy, but at times my forearm would sink in too much and get hot while I'm playing, so for that reason I preferred the soft. They're both great, just matters how much you dig in. If you still want to dig a bit to control your shots on soft you totally can."
54558,Is the hien really fast for a game like csgo??? I play faceit lvl5 with a sens of .96 800. Will flicks be hard on it? Man i wish they have the wine red for the otsu v2 or the zero
54559,"I use hien in csgo and valorant just fine. I'm 1.00 with 800 dpi in csgo so pretty close to you and I do pretty well. It takes a bit to adjust, but I find the tracking and speed are great with solid stopping power.

I also wish I could get some other colors for those pads!"
54560,Is it true ordering from Artisan internationally is a bit of a headache?.  Seem some horror stories
54561,"I'm in the US and it's been smooth every time for me. They ship through DHL which does pretty good on timing and tracking information IMO. I usually get it within a few weeks, which is fine with me considering the pandemic. Only drawback is it adds an extra $20+ for shipping. I almost always order 2 pads since I know shipping will be a lot so if I want to try a few I go for it!"
54562,I was mostly looking at the Zero since it's closest to the QCK but I'm also looking at the Otsu.
54563,What would you rank them (from favorite to least favorite)?
54564,"This is a very tight list as even the lowest one I rate way higher than any other pad I've ever used...

Otsu v2, hien, shidenkai, Raiden, zero.

Zero on bottom because for control it's the best, but otsu v2 is just about as good, but is more comfortable with better speed. Shidenkai at 3 because although there are durability issues, I don't have them yet and it's the most fun pad of the bunch when I really want to fly!"
54565,"Hey!  I'm really looking for a pad that has a bit more speed than my Corsair MP510.  I've loved my Corsair but being that I have the XL desk version, I'm annoyed by how difficult it has become to clean.  The mousepad is a nuisance and has collected so many flecks of dust that negatively affect my gameplay.

&#x200B;

SO... I'm thinking of making the switch to Artisan, specifically the Hien XL Soft.  It's a bit speedier (according to Hoya) so that's the major reason. My questions for you:

1. Is this a good transition if I'm looking for a slightly speedier, easy to clean, long lasting pad?
2. What's the website to order for the US? The Hien Soft XL is in backorder. How often will they come back in stock?"
54566,"1. Yes I think hien is a great pic! I also had a mp510 desk pad size. I liked it! The Cordura feels interesting for sure. Since you're used to slightly rough surfaces and want a little more speed, hien is perfect!
2. So I just go right to artisans website, provided there's no Japanese characters then you made it! I just good artisan mousepad and generally a link for the hien pops up, I usually go there and as long as it's in English, then you're good. You could order from the Japanese version, but not sure how that works with Google translate... I wouldn't risk it.

I think the top 3 (zero, hien, otsu v2) are out of stock right now. Check out @IsArtisan on Twitter for when they go in stock, or regularly check the website to see."
54567,Does the Hien harm mouse feet over time
54568,"Good question... Mine has not really affected the feet, but I haven't used it forever. It seems like it could cause it's a rougher surface, but the surface seems to break in a bit over time and my feet never seem affected."
54569,Thanks for the response. Considering buying one in about a month and that was really my only concern.
54570,"Okay so if I wanted to buy an artisan pad where I live it would cost me $130. Is an artisan pad really worth that price compared to other top pads? I know they are good, but are they really 60$ more than another top pad good."
54571,"This is a great question! Depends on how much you really love pads... I mean for me I'd do it, but that's cause I spent, obviously, tons of money 😂. The way I view it, I know it will get used all the time so it gets the money's worth and outside of shidenkai, they'll all last me for years. Also the market is pretty easy to sell them if you need.

But I'm not sure of your situation. If you're just looking for something solid and can get an Aqua control plus cheaper, I'd probably do that. Ac+ is my universal pick for something other than artisan, but truly I think one big purchase of artisan gets you into end game 👍.

Where are you that it costs that much? Maybe you can buy one on r/mousemarket cheaper used?"
54572,"> on. If you're just looking for something solid and can get an Aqua control plus cheaper, I'd probably do that. Ac+ is my universal pick for something other than artisan, but truly I think one big purchase of artisan gets you into end game 👍. Thanks! yea i know I would use it for a long time so it seems kind of worth it but it still feels hard to justify. I live in Canada and with our dollar being monopoly money and duty fees going crazy its rough out here"
54573,"Ive recently recieved an artisan classic zero mid and before that ive always used qck+ heavy and since i play a lot of csgo i just couldnt get used to the artisan, it felt way to fast and hard to feel comfortable on.. how so?"
54574,Because you have mid. Try soft or xsoft for zero and you'll notice the speed is reduced a good amount. Mid is only good on Raiden and shidenkai IMO cause those are built to be fast.
54575,Which one do you find easiest to be relaxed on?
54576,"Otsu v2 is super comfortable IMO, but Raiden is probably the second softest surface that makes me comfy. Raiden is fast though, so when I whip that out I have to be ready!"
54577,"Glad ive got a raiden then! The hien felt like i had to put too much effort in to tracking, on the raiden it just works"
54578,"Yeah I'd say Raiden is faster, but not way faster. Hien takes a bit of getting used to. If you want speed, comfort, and durability, Raiden is an easy win."
54579,"Hey! currently i have artisan hein mid and it's EXTREMELY fast, totally wasn't what i expected, what is the closest one to the QCK HEAVY not the normal qck and how does the raiden feels like? looking at the material..it feels like a zowie g-sr se?"
54580,"Mid makes the pads faster for sure. My otsu v2 in mid felt faster than my hien in soft. So your comment doesn't surprise me.

Closest to qck is the zero. Raiden is way faster. Raiden is faster than your hien, though only a little bit. Raiden feels very soft to the touch and is quite unique, not like gsr se."
54581,"the material of the hein feels really tough for some reason lol, i am not quiet sure if i will ever get used to it tbh it's not like the zowie gtf-x for example, it's WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY faster like i'nve never tried something crazy fast"
54582,"Yeah hien material is rough and takes adjusting. Otsu v2 on the other hand, is plushhhh. You might want to try that?"
54584,"I currently have a zero XL in soft and love it for aim focused games like valorant but find it harder for fast games like warzone/cod where I need fast movements or in apex when tracking (feels harder to target transition) and time to kill takes longer. I was thinking of trying the hien XL in soft next in hopes of finding one mousepad to do it all (valorant aim focused, apex tracking, cod fast paced, etc). 

Do you think the hien would be a good fit for my needs (or would say the Hayate Otsu V2 be better)? I bought my zero off amazon and it seemed legit to me and was wondering what your thoughts were on getting it off a 3rd party seller on amazon.

Thanks!"
54585,"It's a hard call. I think the otsu v2 is a fantastic middle ground between zero and hien. Hien is great for tracking at the cost of a little control. For me, otsu v2 is that perfect middle ground.

That being said, I can play valorant with my hien pretty well, hell I play valorant with my shidenkai 😉. I think you can get adjusted to anything, just takes some practice.

In terms of ordering, for me I always get it right from their website as you have the most options and I trust it after ordering 8 pads from them. Never tried Amazon, though they're obviously reliable if you can get the pad you want."
54586,"I initially went with the zero thinking it would be the safest route as I have been on GSRs for a few years now. Objectively, the ostu v2 sounds like it would probably be the one if it is a mix between speed + control between the zero and hien. Looks like amazon does not have the ostu v2 in stock (only v1 otsu). I'll prolly grab one off the official website then whenever they restock and since shipping is quite expensive maybe grab the hien from there as well to make the shipping price worth it. 

Thanks again!"
54587,"Zero is the safest one because it's the most premium version of all the pads people are used to. Otsu v2 is pretty unique, but I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't like this surface. Otsu v2 is really insane! Honestly all artisan pads are and they all fit a niche well."
54588,"Hi! Could I get a list with speed and control listed for each pad out of 10? Thx!

Example: Hien ?/10 control ?/10 speed"
54589,"Zero - 10/10 control 4/10 speed

Otsu v2 - 9/10 control 6/10 speed

Hien - 7/10 control 7/10 speed

Raiden 5/10 control 8/10 speed

Shidenkai 3/10 control 10/10 speed

Something like that 👍"
54590,"Have you ever played pubg? If so, what pad you recommend? I usually pubg, cod, csgo."
54591,"Barely played pubg, but cod is faster and csgo is slower. Any of the ""big 3"" are the safe picks for most people unless you want wild speed. Big 3 are zero, otsu v2, and hien. More control, go zero, more speed to hien, a nice balance and cozy surface, go otsu."
54592,really tempting me with me new otsu v2
54593,Great pad! 👌
54594,What were the changes that they made to the old Hayate Otsu?
54595,"I never owned the old one, but apparently durability is the biggest change."
54596,Hien vs Raiden vs Zero?
54597,"I have comparisons in my main post and tons of comments, but...

Speed

Raiden, hien, zero


Control

Zero, hien, Raiden

All have insanely good durability. Get soft or xsoft for hien and zero and mid for Raiden 👍."
54599,"Do you own a Fnatic Dash/Glorious Fire? If so how does the hayate otsu compare to those pads? As in glide, touch and feel of fabric to hand/arm. Thanks in advance."
54600,I have a glorious fire. Fire does feel different for sure. Otsu v2 is very unique. I'd say more speed on otsu and about the same control and it's more comfortable.
54602,"Yes, Raiden is in striking distance of shidenkais speed and very comfortable. I do have to point out, I've had one spinout, but for the amount of time I've used it I think that's appropriate.

Fantastic speed pad 👍!"
54603,My favorite mousepad os the Qck edge. My mousepad is getting old (coming on 3 years). I also tried the glorious 3xl but found it to be too slippery. Which artisan is most like the Qck?
54604,"i’m torn between getting a Hayate Otsu v2 and a zero, i’m coming for a hyperx furys with a viper ultimate. i play r6 mainly with a little below average sensitivity, which would you recommend because honestly i can’t decide

(i’m open to other pads but those are what i’ve narrowed it down too)"
54605,"Hey man,i have the zero soft and i want something i Little bit faster,i Press a lot when i play...Is the zero mid faster?"
54606,"I have the zero mid,is the soft slower?"
54607,"Hey I’m a very competitive FPS player who plays Valorant overwatch and apex legends. I play fingertip grip with the viper mini and have a mm350 atm. Out of the ostu v2, hien, and zero what would you suggest?"
54608,Is there any way to know whether a seller on eBay is selling Otsu v2 or v1?
54609,"Hey, i play a lot of valorant, warzone, other shooters and mobas.I play standard 800 dpi and in game sens varies but i don't know what's the safest bet for me to buy

I use a hyperx fury extended (non speed) and a glourious fire pad"
54610,"Hi,

I want to thank you for all the incredibly detailed help you've been providing others, as reading through your comments has been enlightening about Artisan pads I've yet to try. Having a bit of a dilemma in selecting a new one, myself. I currently own a Hien Soft XL. However, I've meandered between different types of pads over the years, and can never find what's ""right"" for me.

Certainly, I'm questioning whether the Hien is the ultimate solution, because it just doesn't click for me the way I wish it did. Had it a little over 3 months, and I'd say it's fairly broken in now, but perhaps I just need to give it more time? For a bit of background, my best flicking aim has been with the QCK Heavy, of which I've owned two. My best tracking has been on a Glorious Helios hard pad, of which I've also owned two. Obviously, these are VASTLY different surfaces, and it's hard to find a truly happy medium. I mostly play Overwatch and Valorant at 800 dpi, with 2.65 and 0.25 sens respectively. I'm generally more accurate in tracking aim training exercises than I am in flicking.

As for my question, which pad(s) do you think provide the best middle ground (if not the Hien Soft) between my favorites among previous pads, given that I lean more towards tracking but want to maintain at least some control for flicking? Should I simply keep trying to use the Hien? I'm definitely not against ordering new pads, and have considered the Raiden in XSoft, or the Otsu V2 in Soft or XSoft. Even pondered whether I should try the Hien in XSoft or Mid. In any case, I appreciate any help, and all the time you've put into assisting the community!"
54611,"Hi there! Thanks for the comment, I've really enjoyed helping people pick a good pad!


For your situation, you seem to want a middle ground for tracking and stopping. Raiden and otsu v2 are both great alternatives to the hien if you want to try something else. I'm leaning towards saying otsu v2 in soft or xsoft as it will give you nearly the same tracking capability as the hien, with a touch more stopping power and a very unique and fun surface! 


On the flip side, if you want a bit more tracking the Raiden is really great, but I'd recommend mid for Raiden as I hear xsoft negates the speed benefits a bit. Raiden doesn't stop as great, but it's really fun!


Both are really awesome, but the direct answer to your question is otsu v2, the speedy fun solution is Raiden 👍."
54612,"How much slower is the zero than the Hien? I swear my Hien has slowed down loads to the point where I think would be like a zero cause the initial static friction isn’t non existent now and it definitely feels slower, like pretty much same speed as my Dechanic control now. I’ve washed the Hien as well and it still not the same as when I got it"
54613,"Hien, at least for me, is a good amount faster. Mine has worn a bit, but mine actually feels faster broken in. Not sure, that's odd *shrug*."
54614,"check your mouse glides, theres high chance its not a pad fault"
54615,"Damn you right as fuck, just changed it and it’s a lot closer to the glide when I first got it. Any suggestions for mouse feet that stay consistent? I’ve bought some cheap tiger arcs but it appears as tho they change quite a bit over time"
54616,"[https://corepad.com/](https://corepad.com/) They offer pretty much feet for all popular mice and are on the lower cost side (shipping included), 100% PTFE - might wear down with time

consistent feet that wont wear with time - ceramic feet - [https://www.lexip.co/](https://www.lexip.co/) \- however they are not a safe choice - gives very specific feeling so hard to recommend"
54617,Get Corepads or Hyperglides. They're one of the top few aftermarket mouse feet companies out there.
54618,"Does the brown color of the raiden stick out like a sore thumb? I'm a little worried that it wouldn't look good with the rest of my setup, which is mostly black/white. I had the shidenkai for about a year and removed it's top glass layer after it burned out. Ive been thinking about getting the raiden."
54619,It honestly looks black. I barely notice the brown at all.
54620,I'd just wait for the ac+ to come back in stock on lethal gaming gear.
54621,"i’m probably just gonna buy the zero for 150 on amazon when it comes back to stock or from lgg, whichever is fastest"
54622,Hold up! $150? That's way too much. And I have two Zeros. I paid $50 for the large version.
54624,"I mean, the zero classic is in stock on artisan's site right now. It's the exact same as the fx, sans stitched edges."
54625,are there any recent videos/reviews confirming this? I was under the impression that the zero underwent a change in the last year or so and the surface is much less abrasive than it once was. I would assume the classic is the original surface and not the updated one.
