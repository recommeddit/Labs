64080,Kobo rulz! I got the forma a few months ago it's fantastic.
64081,i wanted to love the kobo but my main problem was the lighting shade on each side of the screen was different which was really distracting
64082,Completly understandable. I think its a screen lottery. I've heard of people returning 3 or 4 till getting a good one. I was lucky first time. (or my eyes don't detect the lighting shade difference)

That's not true. Even if it was, MAM would be enough for you. Any book you can't find on MAM, just make a request. If the book exists on BIB, the request will be filled."

64125,"If you're on android, you can check out Tachiyomi. On pc, I think you can use an emulator for it, not completely sure though."
64126,The thing is Tachiyomi and most downloaders have single chapters available. I have a Kindle that I want to use and I have to convert every single chapter for it. That's why I was wondering if any site hosted complete volumes so I don't have to convert as much
64127,Use nyaa (dot)si and search your manga. You get the whole volumes
64128,"I use it to study some japanese with raws of simple mangas like Doraemon, it's pretty great"

64158,"I noticed my list of sources was badly out of date a few weeks ago. Thanks for the list!

Also +1 for calibre. It's a great program and constantly getting updates to support new ereaders."
64159,"I've got a love/hate relationship with Calibre. It's addicting to fill in all that metadata. It's annoying that it doesn't support subfolder organisation (e.g. like most music players (iTunes, MusicBee, fb2k, Dopamine, WMP, etc.) do).

This becomes a problem now that I've got an Android-based eReader, and all that metadata and organisation in Calibre is worthless because no eReader app on Android supports it, and I'm going to have to manually create loads of folders to organise the ebooks."
64160,"If you mean how Calibre organizes the files within folders on your hard drive, then yyeah, I have to agree. I hate that ""black box"" style that the app chooses where the files are stored and the user shouldn't be nosing about in the folder tree. Iirc, that's how iTunes used to work. On balance, considering how well Calibre does everything else, I'm willing to overlook that detail.

I can't help think your issue with metadata on Android ereaders hasn't been brought up before. Have you [checked the forums on MobilRead](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/index.php) for a solution? The forum for Calibre is one of the biggest there and the developer is quite active. I use a Kobo ereader, so I can't offer much else.

In Calibre, you can nest subgenres within a genre by using dots. So ""Sci-Fi.Cyberpunk"" and ""Sci-Fi.Aliens"" will result with Cyberpunk and Aliens as two separate trees under a top level Sci-Fi genre. I can't help thinking there is a tool or plugin that allows syncing to a device according to a user's preference."
64161,"I didn't know any of those tricks! Thank you so much!

I'll ask around on MobileRead, but I have a feeling that I can't be the first person with an Android eReader lol, and that it'll be a WONTFIX issue, kinda like the black box organisation of books.


**Rant:**

Can't understand how Calibre's black box folder tree requirement thing hasn't been loosened. Posts I've seen typically say ""Oh, but tags are better. Deal with it."" Windows Media Player prefers ```Artist/Album/01 Song.mp3``` organisation, similar to Calibre's ```Author/BookTitleButCutOff organisation/filename.bookformat```. WMP, however, doesn't care if you do some custom folders, as it looks for the song metadata (album, artist, etc.) in the ID3 tags built into the MP3 file. Calibre stores metadata in those OPF files, because most ebook formats don't support additional metadata like ID3; don't know why it can't just look for ```filename.opf```, ```filename.jpg``` (book cover) and assume the existence of ```filename.bookformat``` next to it, and save the file location to the main metadata database. That way, you get the best of both worlds - you can organise your books as you wish in folders, and keep the metadata, etc. functions of Calibre"
64162,"I double checked to see if the nested genres worked out of the box or if they needed some specific setting and [found the manual entry for it](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/sub_groups.html).

Oh, and one thing I like to share that I came up with which is useful if you have lots of metadata entries in one category, like genres. I entered an empty txt file into Calibre as a new book and gave it ""AAA Notes"" for the title and ""AAA AAA"" for the author so it always floats to the top in alphabetical sorting. Alternately, use Zs to push it to the bottom and out of sight. I then tagged it with entries like ""A -----"" ""B ------"" ""C -----"" etc. In alphabetical sorting, like in the genre picker menu, they help add space and make for easier referencing for the tags, otherwise my eyes just swim with all those entries. The dummy book also holds temporary tags and tags I expect to use in the future so that they're already present in the database for me to select. I use the text file itself to add notes on calibre and ebooks in general. I have a few thousand books in my library and it's helped add some order when filling in metadata. I've since done something similar with my music library and it's helped too."
64163,That's really smart! I've noticed it getting more difficult to find things in both my music and book libraries - I'll try something similar; it's a little like sub-libraries :D

64184,"This: https://archive.org/details/internetarchivebooks

Here you can ''borrow'' books for 14 days or an hour, but you have to make an account. Its totally legal, its just like an online library instead of being physical"
64185,"""Borrow"", then DeDRM using Calibre and DeDRM Tools plugin. To download ""1 hour loan"" ebooks, you need a bookmarklet:

    javascript:window.location=window.location.protocol+'//'+window.location.hostname+'/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&identifier='+window.location.pathname.split(""/"").pop()+'&format=pdf&redirect=1'"
64186,"Could you explain ""DeDRM"" and ""bookmarklet"". Im afraid I've no idea of those lol"
64187,"By default, any PDF you get from Archive.org can only be opened using Adobe Digital Editions for a short space of time (1 hour or 14 days, depending on the book). This limitation is called ""Digital Rights Management"" (DRM), because it allegedly protects the rights of (long dead) authors and (fat cat rich) publishers to stop you from reading their books without paying.

If you're on r/Piracy, then you're here to bypass DRM. You should already know what it is.

As for bookmarklets, you know how you can right-click on your bookmarks bar and select ""Create Bookmark""? Instead of putting a website address, you can put a bit of javascript (similar to what I posted above) and save it. Clicking on this special bookmark will run the script on your current webpage."
64188,"Ohhh DRM, yes heard of it while browsing Archive.org but actually I don't know how to bypass it. I'll have look around here.

Bookmarklet, pretty interesting you can enter code instead of a url. Nice!"

You will get a URLLink.acsm, which you open using Adobe Digital Editions to download a DRMed PDF (same with ""14 day loan"" books) - you then import that PDF into Calibre (with apprenticeharper's
DeDRM_tools from GitHub installed), and you've got a DRM-free PDF of a book unavailable anywhere else. Might be blurry, unoptimised PDF/A, without indexes, which, if you're really serious about that book, you can fix using a pirate's version of ABBYY FineReader or Adobe Acroba Pro."

64196,"When it comes to non e-learning books, myanonamouse, audiobookbay, mobilism, nonvanon are the sites you want to have.  DC++ is the 2nd best place for books on the internet but I guess it's technically not a website.  Also the hub is private and I think rather difficult to get into these days, so maybe it's not worth mentioning.

Funny enough youtube has a decent amount of books.  If someone is new to pirating and you want them to dip their toes, just tell them to search up some of their favorite authors on youtube.  

For example if I type in one of my favorite authors Vaughn Heppner into youtube just about every single audiobook he's ever done is on there.  Takes maybe a month for new releases to get onto youtube."

I like dirty talk and explicit sex, enemies-to-lovers, competent heroines with genuine ambitions, heroes who respect (but feel protective of) their heroines (this is especially true for the enemy-to-lover trope), and a healthy amount of slow burn (maximise that sexual tension)."
14408,We have similar taste in books! Do you have other recs?
14409,"I just got around to reading Love Lettering by Kate Clayborn. It was a 4/5 for me, enjoyable but somewhat unremarkable, but I may read again at some point.

Serpent & Dove by Shelby Mahurin was pretty good for a fantasy romance rec, though not nearly enough sex for me. 4/5

The Bridge Kingdom by Danielle L Jensen was almost really good, but it utilised a trope I cannot stand (heroine not coming clean to hero about a previous deception, resulting in a huge needless conflict that could have been easily avoided). I'm really considering giving it another shot, though, because the world building was pretty great and I think I was overly harsh.

Rock Bottom Girl by Lucy Score was also a 3.5/5, good but unremarkable. It got pretty cheesy near the end. 

Iron and Magic by Ilona Andrews is the only Ilona Andrews book I've read so far, but I quite liked it. It's the first (and currently only) book in a series, and it's an offshoot of the Kate Daniels series which I have yet to read. 4.5/5

If you want something a little bit more shallow/unsubstantial/trashy, The Fae Chronicles by Amelia Hutchins might tickle your fancy. The story got pretty flimsy later in the series, and there's bdsm elements, but I found the first book in particular pretty enjoyable. 4/5 for the first book, 3.5/5 for the whole series."
14410,"I still haven‚Äôt found five romance books I absolutely love, but so far, the ones that have been my favorites are: 

1. Love in the Afternoon by Lisa Kleypas. This is, by far, her best work, in my opinion. The writing is so beautiful, so evocative. The way the hero and heroine fall in love with each other through exchanging letters and opening up to each other in such vulnerable ways is so, so, so lovely to read. 

2. A Week to be Wicked by Tessa Dare. I love how lighthearted and goofy the hero is, how he has such a whimsical sense of humor. I love how the heroine is so ambitious and independent and has interests and goals outside the romance. And I love how both of them constantly support and uplift and encourage each other to be their best selves.

3. Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare. I just adore how grumpy yet endearing the hero is. His sarcastic, quick-witted humor is so fun to read, and I love the bantering and bickering that happen between him and the heroine. This is one of the funniest romance books I‚Äôve read that still manages to be incredibly sweet and swoon-worthy."
14411,I loved Love in the Afternoon!! I may have also borrowed Beatrix‚Äôs name for my kid... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
14412,That‚Äôs so cute! I‚Äôve definitely fallen in love with so many characters whom I would totally name my children after. Beatrix is a really pretty name for a child. üòÄ
14413,"I really liked it, I thought it had lots of options. She could be a Bea, Trixie, or just straight Beatrix. I thought it had style! Hopefully she won‚Äôt hate me for my choice. She‚Äôs only just over a year old."
14414,"No, that‚Äôs such a lovely name! She‚Äôll totally love you for it. And I completely agree. I‚Äôve always liked names where you can make multiple nicknames out of it. I‚Äôve always loved the intimacy of people you‚Äôre really close to calling you by a shortened version of your name."
14415,"1. The Last Hour of Gann by R Lee Smith (TW: proceed with caution - multiple rape scenes)
2. What the Wind Knows by Amy Harmon
3. Angelfall by Susan Ee
4. Overture by Skye Warren
5. Cottonwood by R Lee Smith

The first one was easy - fav book of all time. What do they have in common? They all have a thread of fantasy to them, really(except for Overture by Skye Warren). Some kind of adventure, or story. Made up creatures and made up lands. I would reread all of these books. There are other books that were really excellent but I wouldn't consider a favorite because it just wasn't memorable enough. I consider a book a favorite if I still think about it months and months after reading. I've read sooo many amazing books. It's hard to narrow it down to such a small number!"
14416,"Ugh. Last Hour of Gann has like a 100 pages of rape descriptions. It is the worst book I‚Äôve ever read. I really wish people would warn potential readers what a bleak, rape-filled book it is. It needs a trigger warning every time it‚Äôs mentioned."
14417,Sorry! I try to remind that on every post but this time it slipped my mind. I'll edit that to include it

Take A Hint, Dani Brown by Talia Hibbert  
Drive by Kate Stewart  
Teardrop Shot by Tijan  
   
I can't pick a 5th it is way too stressful  :|"
14420,"It changes a lot but right now they are:

1. Act Like it.
2. The hating game.
3.  Love lettering.
4. The deal/ The risk.
5. You deserve each other."
14421,"1.  Simply Love by Mary Balogh, because I love those two damaged beautiful people, and they turned a trope I hate into something lovely
2.  The Winter Sea by Susanna Kearsley, for a story that consumed me and a surprise ending that made me laugh with happiness
3.  Any Old Diamonds by KJ Charles, for an engaging, amusing heist and spectacular characters
4.  Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare, for a great beauty and the beast story that celebrates the community of fiction-readers
5.  The Spires series by Alexis Hall - do I really have to pick one?  Argh.  Such gorgeous, imperfect characters that grow and change and inspire introspection."
14422,"1. You Deserve Each Other- Sarah Hogle
2. The Hating Game- Sally Thorne
3. Well Met- Jen DeLuca
4. The Unhoneymooners- Christina Lauren
5. You Had Ne At Hola-Alexis Daria"
14423,"1. Bringing down the duke by Evie Dunmore 
2. A Rogue of ones own by Evie Dunmore 
3. The simple wild by KA tucker 
4. The idea of you by robinne lee 
5. A kingdom of dreams by Judith McNaught 

I definitely think my favorite books usually do NOT involve insta love and the relationship is developed over  time. The stakes to be together must be high as well! I usually prefer a good amount of angst and emotional turmoil. Hero can be grumpy/rakish but ultimately sweet and tender. 

It‚Äôs hard to do a top 5 so my additional favorites: tempt me by twilight, devil in winter, love in the afternoon... all by Lisa Kleypas. She delivers the most swoon worthy hero‚Äôs and strong heroines!"
14424,"I just adore Evie Dunmore‚Äôs books as well! Her prose is amazing. As much as I love historical inaccuracies a la Tessa Dare, Dunmore‚Äôs romances are just elevated because the stakes are so much higher."
14425,"1) Transcendence by Shay Savage 
2) The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie by Jennifer Ashley
3) A Week to be Wicked by Tessa Dare
4) The V Girl by Mya Roberts 
5) Heart-Shaped Hack by Tracey Garvis Graves"
14426,Ohhhh Lord Ian. I forgot that one on my list.
14427,Number 2 on my book list but number 1 book boyfriend üò≠
14428,Enjoyed Transcendence.  It has been the most unusual romance novel I have read this last summer.
14429,"Same here, I'm still not over it üò©"
14430,"Hmmm this will be difficult. I might have to do this based purely on number of times I have reread a book. In no particular order:

1.  The Duchess Deal by Tessa Dare (audiobook)

2.  Sustained by Emma Chase

3. What Happens in London by Julia Quinn

4.  Pairing Off by Elizabeth Harmon

5.  Misadventures with a Professor by Sierra Simone"
14431,"I LOVE What Happens in London üòÅ


(And I think we‚Äôve already had this conversation before)"
14432,"Lol, yes we have! But it‚Äôs still awesome! That moment where they make eye contact, and she drops to the floor and then her brother comes in... I cackle every time I read it!! Then the dramatic reading of Miss Butterworth and the Mad Baron!! 

Did you know she‚Äôs developing a graphic novel of Miss Butterworth with her sister?? I want it SOOO BAD!"
14433,"OMG yes!!

What I would give to be able to read this book for the first time again!"
14434,"Top 3: 

Red, White, & Royal Blue

Beach Read

Take A Hint, Dani Brown & Get A Life, Chloe Brown


Down a bit but still 5 stars:

The Duchess Deal

* The Wall of Winnipeg and Me by Mariana Zapata
* Beach Read by Emily Henry
* Radiance by Grace Draven
* The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie by Jennifer Ashley"
14437,That audiobook was soooo good! Definitely added to the story haha
14438,"1 - Sugar Daddy by Lisa Kleypas.  The whole series is fantastic, but this one is my ATF.  

2 - An Offer from a Gentleman by Julia Quinn.  This was my first Bridgerton novel, and I adored the ‚ÄúCinderella‚Äù storyline.

3 - Unclaimed by Courtney Milan.  I love everything Courtney writes, but this one had me bawling the first time I read it.  I grew up in a super conservative home where I was taught that no good man would want an ‚Äúimpure‚Äù woman, so this really hit home!

4 - Untouchable by Sam Mariano.  Really just the quintessential bully romance IMO.  

5 - Hold by Claire Kent.  I remember reading this like ten years ago before it was revised and fleshed out.  RIP Ellora‚Äôs Cave. 

I based these off of what I actually reread.  I don‚Äôt reread most books, but these are what I do go back to.  There‚Äôs a couple others - The Lady Most Likely, or the Wallflower quartet by Lisa Kleypas, but I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre my ATF!!"
14439,"Beach Read - Emily Henry  
You Deserve Each Other - Sarah Hogle  
The FriendZone/Happily Ever After Play List - I'm putting both Abby Jimenez books together because I'm cheating and they piggy back off one another so sue me!!!

4. Something Wild and Perfect & All the Little Lights by Julia McBryant (both books are about the same couple)
5. Sweet Nothings by Macy Blake

Honorable Mention (i.e. guilty pleasure): Fire From The Sea by Noah Harris and Rowan Porter

Aside from all being MM romances, there's nothing they really have in common.  2 are paranormal, 1 is non-shifter omegaverse, 2 are contemporary one of which is a bodyguard thriller and the other is rich kids of the south.  4 of them (and the honorable mention) have an MC who's in a really bad position in life for whatever reason - that's the only commonality I can think of."

I truly have so many more than 5 that are on my ""will reread any time"" favorites list! But if I had to choose, it would be these guys. Not in any real order."
14450,"My top 5 as of now, subject to change with out notice. And, in no particular order.

 Ever Yours, Annabelle by Elisa Braden.

 Ravishing The Heiress by Sherry Thomas.

 Wicked and The Wallflower by Sarah Maclean

 One Good Earl Deserves A Lover by Sarah Maclean

 Storm by Carian Cole.

  I say that I'm not really a big fan of HR, but, yet, four out of my top 5 books are historicals. Go figure."
14451,"You guys are killing me... my TBR is now twice as long :) 

My Current Top 5: 

1. Red, White, & Royal Blue
2. Heated Rivalry 
3. Pansies
4. For Real
5. I'm saving this spot for that elusive m/f book I have yet to give five stars to. I will find one eventually. Maybe if I stopped reading so much m/m... 

Although, if I had to pick my fave m/f I would say Beach Read or Stay by Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy"
14452,"You mean I have to choose?!?! Well fine, here it goes:

1. No Other Love by Candace Camp

2. Undecided by Julianna Keyes

3. Well Met by Jen DeLuca

4. The Ex Effect by Karlsa Sorensen

5. Like No Other Lover by Julie Ann Long

I think the only thing they all have in common is that I absolutely fell in love with the characters (although, the two HR's have weirdly similar titles lol). These are definitely my big comfort reads, the ones I go to whenever I need a pick-me-up. They definitely change over time, especially as since I'm always reading new romances, but number 1 will always stay the same (read it when I was 16 and have read it dozens and dozens of times since)."
14453,"In no particular order 
Someone to Watch Over Me by Anne Berkeley
Sweet Filthy Boy by Christina Lauren 
Under Locke by Mariana Zapata 
Always Only You by Chloe Liese

14459,"GOSH. I'm a RWRB junkie, and I've evangelized it to all my friends. I'm also obsessed with Alyssa Cole's Reluctant Royals--those books are so funny and over the top, but the characters, sex scenes, and love stories are really good. I want everyone on this earth to read Beach Read, and I love love love Get a Life, Chloe Brown and Take a Hint, Dani Brown.  I don't think Sarah Maclean's Rules of Scoundrels series gets enough love and I shout that out on most threads, too."
14460,"Omg, I just started the Rules of Scoundrels series and read the first two books in three days! LOVE Sarah Maclean's writing and can't wait to get my hands on the third one. The Goodreads reviews are solid, but I don't think they do the books enough justice."
14461,Yes yes! One Good Earl Deserves a Lover is one of my all-time favorite historical romances!
14462,"Ok, Beach Read keeps being mentioned and Chloe Brown so I added them to my list. Reluctant Royals-intriguing! I will look up that and Rules of Scoundrels. Thank you!"
14463,Literally finished Beach Read today. Read it :)
14464,SAME. beach read was just too good
14465,"I LOVED Take a Hint, Dani Brown but haven‚Äôt read the first one. I must rectify this!"
14466,You absolutely must!
14467,RWRB is the best depiction of bisexuality in a romance novel that I‚Äôve read.
14468,I'm almost embarrassed to ask but what is RWRB?
14469,"Red, White & Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston!"
14470,"Red, White & Royal Blue!!"
14471,"I am so on the same page with you about RWRB, I love it so much and it‚Äôs what got me into the genre."
14472,"Are we the same person? I can‚Äôt stop recommending Alyssa Cole and Talia Hibbert books to anyone and everyone, and for any reading request, there‚Äôs a Cole or Hibbert book. Just this week two of my friends thanked me for getting them to read Get a Life, Chloe Brown. I also think I‚Äôve run out of people to suggest RWRB to, I am obsessed. I made my sister and my grandma read it!"
14473,I loved Beach Read and Get a Life Chloe Brown too!
14474,I saw this thread and leapt on it to recommend the Brown sisters books so now will be looking up everything else you recommended üòä
14475,Definitely check out Alyssa Cole
14476,"Also, I really enjoyed RWRB myself. Such a good book!"
14477,Have you read Boyfriend Material by Alexis Hall? It is my new go-to recommendation when someone mentions they enjoyed RWRB. I laughed out loud so many times and think I actually love it more than RWRB!
14478,"Radiance by Grace Draven, Any book by Amy Harmon"
14479,"I absolutely loved Radiance (finished it last week) and I'm currently on an Amy Harmon re-read binge. Harmon's stories are so different, from fantasy to historical and contemporary, and they're so, so good."
14480,">Radiance (finished it last week)

Have you read book two? It's series and book will be out this month.

>Amy Harmon re-read binge. Harmon's stories are so different, from fantasy to historical and contemporary, and they're so, so good.

She is Queen of contemporary fiction. I just read Where the lost wander is American historical fiction (I don't like historical fiction) but I like this one. 
Have you read her fantasy novel ""The bird and the sword""?"
