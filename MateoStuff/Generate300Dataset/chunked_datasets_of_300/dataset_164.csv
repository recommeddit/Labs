53695,"Definitely. When I feel myself coming down with something, I'll take melatonin around 8pm every single night to ensure I'm in bed by 9 and get a full night's sleep. 

I'm always back to 100% within a week.

EDIT: Dang auto-correct."
53696,melatonin always gives me the craziest dreams
53697,"It's gotten to the point where even if I just fall asleep on the couch and someone watches tv, it enters my brain and fucks me up. Sister was watching an episode of svu about child porn and I ah..."
53698,"ME TOO! I rarely ever have dreams, and even when I do, they're mild. I take melatonin and my husband says I have random conversations with him and I have really crazy off-the-wall dreams."
53699,This...but add water. Water is a pretty amazing liquid.
53700,This is great and all but I cant sleep for shit when im sick.
53701,"Exactly. I hate when people continue with their stuff (work, school) when they're sick and then complain constantly that they feel like shit.  Take one day off and just sleep. You'll feel better the next day, and I don't have to hear you bitch."
53702,"If I could afford the $80 wage loss and $20 copay to get a doctor's note so I don't get fired, you bet your ass I'd take the day off to rest."
53703,"A LOT of people HAVE to keep doing stuff. Some professors require lecture and won't do excused absences (fucking bullshit...), and some people can't get out of work. It's fucking stupid. I would rather have someone take the day off and get well faster rather than suffer and do poor work for longer."
53704,"Some of us have no choice. Such as people who work at a short staffed fast food restaurant that has next to no closers. I have tried calling off three times, only successful once"
53705,"This only works if you catch the symptoms right away.  Achey, sore neck, sniffles, chills.

1.  Stop whatever you are doing and go home.
2.  Slice up some fresh ginger and steep in hot water (3 or 4 quarter sized pieces should be fine)
3.  Draw a (as hot as you can stand) bath and get in, drink tea
4.  Get in bed under heavy and or thick blankets.
5.  Sleep and sweat

Why it works:  Core temperature has an effect on viral replication rate.  If you get your core temp up just 1 degree C you can slow down the speed at which the viruses are replicating.  Ginger warms you up, the bath warms you up and the heavy blankets keep you warm.  Your immune system works better in stage 3 and 4 sleep so an hour or two napping gives your body a better shot at fighting off whatever has got you.  

If your symptoms are mild when you do this the chances are good you will wake up feeling much better.  You should still continue to hydrate and rest.  If you are stuck somewhere and you can't do this and your symptoms worsen, you can still try it but it won't be as likely to produce the same ""magic"".

If you don't have ginger, hot water, hot and sour soup, miso soup, tea... just something warming will do fine."
53706,"Came here to say something similar, but you've covered it all. :) ginger and miso are amazing for kicking a cold. Add scallions to the miso soup for greater effect and tastiness!"
53707,"Ginger? According to my German grandfather, you're supposed to drink a lot of booze. If that doesn't work, drink more booze."
53708,Ginger booze!
53709,I'm pretty sure that's just the German cure for everything.
53710,"By the time you start having a bit of a sorethroat, is it already too late to do this?"
53711,"Nope, a bit of sore throat should be fine, it has more to do with once you notice it, do something about it.  If your throat is inflamed and miserable, then it is probably too late, but if you get that feeling that you know is going to lead to a sorer throat, then time to spring into action, or rather spring into inaction."
53712,"I did this on my honeymoon when i came down with a cold (and coincidentally a massive pimple that I still have a spot from) in London. I boiled myself, drank hot tea, and passed out under the covers. ""Sweated it out"" as they say."
53713,"I asked this question and was told that although temperature may have an effect, it was more to do with the immune system working better.

53714,"The spiciest, sourest Hot and Sour soup. Mmmm, that drain."
53716,"Like duct tape, pho is the answer to everything."
53717,Tom yum is even better.
53718,"Ever since our kid started going to the Virus Factory (read: preschool), I've had the local Chinese food place on speed dial. Their hot and sour works wonders on the drain."
53719,Egg drop soup for me. If I have congestion then ill eat a ton of jalapeños.
53720,I like your ñ.
53721,"I understand this thread is deliberately asking for evidence-free magic potions. But given there's already plenty of bullshit masquerading as science (and it's a slow day), thought I'd post some evidence-based medical advice about treatment of a common cold just in case. All of the below is entirely evidence based (citation if required).

'The common cold' is the term given for upper respiratory tract infections caused by one of many similar viruses.

* An adult has roughly 2-3 colds a year. Children have significantly more.

* All of the following symptoms are entirely common and in keeping with having a cold: runny nose, mild fever, sneezing, sore throat, cough, headache, tiredness, feeling run down.

* The cold typically lasts for upto 7-11 days (longer in people who smoke or have lung disease). If symptoms persist past this point, then it might indicate a post-cold sequelae, another illness, or a concurrent bacterial illness.

**TREATMENTS:** 


* As a cold is a viral illness, antibiotics have no place in their treatment. They will not reduce the length of a cold, nor make you feel better, nor prevent complications. Even using the colour of the runny nose is not an effective determinant of whether antibiotics are required.

* There has been a small study of intranasal antivirals for the cold which showed that it did improve symptoms and reduce mucus production in one to three quarters of patients, but it was associated with increased drowsiness and really hasn't been tested rigorously enough.

* No vitamin supplements or herbal product has been proven effective in treatment of the cold (including Vitamin C and echinacea)

* Zinc in intranasal and lozenge forms has some evidence in reducing symptoms of cold, however it is NOT recommended due to question marks around toxicity, safety and permanent anosmia (loss of smell sense).

* Intranasal Inhaled steroids have no effect in improving cold symptoms or reducing length of illness (unlike there proven effectiveness in hayfever and similar conditions).

* Cough syrups. Antitussives - there is no clear benefit to symptoms for the use of codeine based cough suppressants in the acute phase of a cold (although there's a greater role in post-cold cough syndromes and chronic coughs). Expectorants - There is a tiny body of evidence that using an expecteroant helps relieve cold-related cough symptoms. 

* Decongestants. Both pseudoephidrine and phenylephrine have been shown to improve congestive symptoms of a cold. Pseudoephidrine is more effective than phenylephrine. Oral tablets should be used cautiously in older people and people with cardiovascular risk factors, topical treatments should only be used for a few days to avoid producing further cold-like symptoms when they are ceased (rebound rhinitis).

* Antihistamines are possibly of some benefit, although the general consensus of the available evidence is that they have a high incidence of side effects for every symptoms they improve.

* Intranasal cromolyn sodium and ipatropium bromide both have evidence that they can reduce the severity and duration of the nasal symtpoms of a cold.

* Relief of sore throat and fever is best achieved through paracetamol/acetaminophen. Aspirin is also effective. NSAIDs can also be used, however they are best indicated for pain (as opposed to other cold symptoms) and should be used cautiously in older patients, renal patients and cardiovascular patients.

* There's reasonably evidence that nasal saline washes can help mucus clearance and thus provide symtpomatic relief (albeit for short time spans).

**PREVENTION:**

* There is no clear evidence for the role of vitamin C in prevention of colds. The exception to this is people who are exposed to cold weather under rigorous exertion conditions (working in the arctic, marathon runners in winter etc.)

* Zinc has evidence that it can reduce the incidence of colds in children. There is no indication this is true in adults. Long-term zinc use can lead to loss of sense of smell.

* There is debatable evidence that moderately-rigorous exercise (5 x a week) led to fewer colds and milder symptoms. There is no clear evidence for minimal exercise (one or two times a week) have a similar effect

* There is no evidence for use of Vit D, Vit E, echinacea, garlic, probiotics or face masks in preventing colds.



Happy cold season."
53722,"Great post. Just a couple things to add:

- Ginger, honey, lemon, salt rinses, and so on may be temporary relievers of sore throats in some people but have limited effect on other symptoms and will not reduce the length of your cold. Chomping down on a ginger root or drinking hot lemon juice with honey will not help you get better faster but it may make some symptoms more bearable in the short term. 
- Homoeopathic remedies contain absolutely no active ingredients, are primarily water, and have no scientific backing whatsoever. Ayurvedic medicine is also bullshit.
- The cold is not caused by cold weather or being cold. The cold is however more prevalent during the winter when large groups tend to spend more time in tight quarters indoors. 
-  “Feed a cold, starve a fever” has very limited scientific backing with only a handful of small scale studies. Medical professionals recommend with either condition that you shouldn't over consume, but if you’re hungry you should eat.
- There is no cure."
53723,"From someone on day two of a severe cold, thank you."
53724,"Boiling water, lemon and honey."
53725,Also if you are older than 21 add some brandy.
53726,I'm Irish so its whiskey every time.
53727,Whiskey is best.
53728,Hot Toddies
53729,Yes! Its called a hot tottie!
53730,Rum works too.
53732,under 21 does work with boiling water.
53733,not with boiling water
53734,"And if you're even older and have given up on life just skip the water, the lemon and the honey and add in some Gin. If you're running low on supplies you can skip the brandy too."
53735,Why do you have to be older than 21?
53736,"Freedom. 

If Europe, 16-18."
53737,"You can still drink below whatever the age is in your own home though, it's not illegal..."
53738,US Drinking laws.
53739,"You can still drink in your own home, who's going to stop you?"
53740,And pepper if you have a sore throat
53741,"It has to be cayenne pepper. Try cayenne, lemon and honey in hot water. Hands down, best remedy for sore throat I've ever tried."
53742,but if you take nyquil be near a bed after this mix
53743,I enjoy a drink when I'm sick but it's not really good for you. It's a little bad for your immune system.
53744,Crush up some ginger and mix the juice in
53745,"A shot of Jack, and as soon as it goes down, another shot of Jack. Followed by sleep. If still sick, repeat."
53746,"From a medical perspective that's probably one of the worst ways to go..

Alcohol before sleep destroys the quality (not quantity) of sleep, meaning that you'll only recover slower."
53747,fucks with the quantity for me too.
53748,I think you missed about three shots of Jack in the middle
53749,and the four rounds of NHL on Xbox Live.
53750,"There have been a handful of times that I've had a cold for a week or two that I couldn't shake, finally said ""fuck it, I'm going out anyway"" Proceeded to get blitzed then woke up fine the next day."
53751,Tea. Tons and tons of tea.
53753,"I saw an article or something on reddit recently, stating that blowing your nose actually worsens the inflammation in you nose/sinuses.

And I've just been visiting an ENT doctor?!?"
53757,"It's a sinus.

Some women actually have slight nasal congestion after an orgasm."
53758,I sneeze a few times afterwards.

53760,I've been 2-5x a day fapper for years and have always bragged about how healthy I am. I never made that connection!
53761,What the fuck.
53762,I have a cold and now I need to take my medicine.
53763,"Really really hot sauna, if you don't have a sauna then just a really really hot shower, then while still in there, take a shot of whiskey or other dark liquor. It really clears the sinuses!"
53764,"""if you don't have a sauna""

How many people have a sauna?"

53768,hot water + lemon juice + rum

Why is the Rum gone?"
53773,"I don't know any magic, but I find that taking care of myself and eating lots of vegetables helps keep me from getting sick."

53780,Pho is also great for hangovers.
53781,It's just great in general.
53782,"THIS.

With plenty of sriracha sauce and lime juice, wrapped in blankets and watching bad television, followed by a long nap.

It may not actually cure anything but you sure as hell feel better.

EDIT- Thank you, kind stranger, for reminding me what makes me feel better and making me realize I can order Pho online for delivery so I don't have to go out in the cold. I would give you Reddit Gold, but I just spent the money on a bowl of Pho. *internet hug* I love you anyways."
53783,Telling myself I'm not going to do it. It's a method Dr. Gavin Free taught me.

53785,"I feel like there may be truth to this. Whenever things are particularly crazy at work, which lasts for 7-8 months at a time, almost no one gets sick. But within two weeks of wrapping up a project, it's fucking plaguetown. Legitimately sick mother fuckers everywhere. Deadly sick, miss your vacation sick."
53786,"Masturbation. 

Been going 5 times a day, everyday for the last 8 years. 

In that time frame I've only been sick three times."

53792,"If possible, cancel everything I'm going to do for the day.

Take vitamins.

Eat well and eat plenty.

Plenty of fluids. 

Rest. 

And Parks and Rec or The Office's earlier seasons."
53793,A bowl of super spicy Pho. Or a spicy plate of Pad Thai.
53794,"I drink some orange juice and work out. I try to trick my body into feeling like everything is okay and I'm actually perfectly healthy. 

I realize that this mind-set is probably just a placebo, but I haven't had a cold past the point of early symptoms in years."
53795,"I do a similar thing. When I'm sick I put even more effort into getting dressed and doing my make up. It's just a mental thing, but looking sick makes me feel sick. Added bonus is not having everyone constantly ask if you're sick."
53796,"It can be one of the following:  
**Easy Mode**  
Put a lot of chili into your food (preferably something like a taco or a sandwhich) and eat it. The spiciness will make your eyes cry and your nose runny. You'll also drink a lot of  water which helps you push away the cold faster. Repeat as necessary.  
  
**Hard Mode**  
Make a cup of chamomile tea and let it cool down. Don't add anything. Grab a small cotton ball, dunk it on the tea and carefully make drops of the liquid fall into your nostrils. Do not inhale but let it slide all the way down your throat. When I do (or was forced by my mom to do this) that, usually the cold is gone the next day guaranteed. But it feels horribly icky > _<;"
53797,"My grandma drank a glass of HOT beer every day and never caught a cold. I pimped it: 1 pint of hot beer (don't boil!), add 2 teaspoons of honey and 2 or 3 drops of mint oil. Drink it slow, but DRINK it. Take 1 aspirin and go to bed. Make sure that there's fresh air in the room you are sleeping in. Wear something that will absorb sweat, because you will be transpiring like a boss (and that's good). If you don't have to work: take 3-4 garlic cloves, mash them. Add honey and (for Heaven's sake, just a drop or two!) tabasco. Swallow it slowly. Garlic is very antibacterial, but will turn you into an unpopular person. Sleep as much as you can. Believe me, I am undergoing that cure right now and feel a lot better than having to take chemical stuff. 

Btw: Grandma was 90 when she passed away in her sleep.

Get well soon."
53798,"Hot toddies. Hot tea, brandy or whiskey, honey, lemon juice, cloves, cinnamon. Tasty as fuck and is a miracle cure.

Also, if you get a bad cough, there is a type of tea you should be able to find at just about any grocery store that is a godsend. It's called Lemon Echinacea Throat Coat. Add some honey, and drink it as often as you can. It's the only thing that saved me when I had whooping cough."
53799,"Drinking 1-2 tbsp of raw apple cider vinegar mixed into a glass of water. It helps clearing your head/sinuses, kills bacteria, and helps with a sore throat if you gargle it warm.

Also a ton of Vitamin C, tea and sleep. And also rom coms. Those always help."
53800,"Sleep will do more to prevent colds than any damn thing you can do. 

That said I take some zinc + vitamin c tablets at the first sign of a cold and the cold disappears in about 24 hours 80% of the time. 

Seriously. Prevention is better than cure."
53801,Be very careful with Zinc. There are loads of side effects that only some people experience.
53802,The Neti pot.  It works wonders.
53803,"Catnip tea, you can even grow the herb yourself :) 
I know it sounds crazy but we've been using it for as long as cats have been loving it hahah."
53804,"I love catnip tea, although sometimes I wish it had the same effect on humans that it does cats. But the relaxing effect on humans is pretty grand!"
53805,I just go outside in the field and start playing with my friends. It really gets my blood rushing.
53806,I make a magical chicken soup.
53807,"Hot wings, chili, night quil and sleep.  If you can handle it, put on 3-4 blankets and sweat it out."
53808,"I buy those chewable vitamin c tablets and eat a fuckload of them.  It doesn't make you feel a lot better, but it reduces the duration of the cold by like 5 days"
53809,"-Salt water gargle
-Super hot shower
-Lymph node massaging

I have no scientific basis for any of these, but when used in combination they seem to fight off my oncoming colds."
53810,"Tylenol Severe Cold and Flu. That shit is magical and got me through work for all of December. This tip was handed down to me by my dad who I had never seen sick. Keep it well, Reddit."
53811,A box of tissues and time.  Just tough it out.
53812,They say you can piss out the sickness. I like to mix half Gatorade and half water and take cranberry pills till I piss it out of me. Helps for me I hope it helps for you.
53813,I'm seeing a lot of Vitamin C consumption on this thread. JUST SO YOU KNOW: Vitamin C is not toxic in large doses...but it will give you diarrhea within about 30 minutes or less. You may want to take your Vitamin C in the comfort of your home and then wait a bit before getting on with your day.
53814,"If I feel it coming, I will spend about a couple of hours in the sauna. Done properly of course, (hydration and breaks). Since doing this, I have dodged every cold and even the flue. Could be luck, but I'm putting my money on the sauna. Healthy eating too..."

1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup strong black tea

53824,"When you feel it coming on, load up on vitamin C, pills, oranges, orange juice. Get it in your body. 3-4 times a day.

* Keep warm even if you feel uncomfortable, heat will help.

* Sleep without distraction. Don't go to bed with your laptop or phone, put on a bit of music if you need to but concentrate on relaxing and just sleep.

* Drink water, tons of it. It'll flush out whatever is in your body and help with digestion, headaches, sinus pain, and increase your metabolism so your body can fight what ever is messing you up.

* When blowing your nose cover one nostril at a time and alternate. You'll reduce the chances of getting that weird feeling when you pop your ears.

* And if all else fails cold FX, I haven't personally tried it but it's gotten great reviews in my family."

53888,"His issues are the symptoms, though."
53889,"It sounds like you may have allergies by the symptoms you're describing. I would try an antihistamine that is non-drowsy like Loratadine(Claritin) paired with some pseudophedrine. That should help your eyes and your nose.

53892,robitussan will keep you from coughing for a while and it's actually pretty helpful... but later on you cough up huge chunks with it. It's good for you to take when you either need to get through some work or just need to take a break from the coughing. Other than that I am recommending a tablesppon mix of cayenne and honey.
53893,"What I have only recently started doing as of last year is using warm saline water to rinse out my nasal cavity, then using a squirty brand of Pseudoephedrine like sudafed to stop things- the clear nasal cavity means that the medication gets to work. 

Paracetamol will lower your temperature, codeine helps stop the cough reflex and honey is good for your throat. 

Can't recommend the saline rinse hard enough, though- test the water temperature on your wrist like you would for a baby's bottle; oh, and I just use a squirty 'sports' water bottle to do mine- no fancy netty pot needed :)"
53894,"A ton of people I know swear by using Oil of Wild Oregano when sick. Apparently you just put a few drops under your tongue every hour and bam a few hours later, your cold is gone.

53899,"Alka Seltzer.  It doesn't fix it all, but it makes me more functional and less gross, and it goes to work quickly."
53900,"I was surprised by what wasn't included on the list.

A big one is Vitamin D.  Lots of research out there shows that D has several effects directly against viruses.  Likewise it acts as an immune system modulator, limiting overreaction to novel viruses.

Zinc gluconate.  For years it was disregarded because it did not kill viruses.  Instead it inhibits their reproduction, but only in the mucous membranes.  Typically zinc is poorly absorbed by the sinuses, but zinc gluconate as well as zinc acetate are readily absorbed.  Gluconate has accomplished the valued ""will reduce duration and severity"" from the FDA."
53901,"IIRC the british had an ""institute for the common cold"" where they spent many years testing different things, and the only thing which they found effective was zinc."
53902,"It may be out of pure luck, but I wasn't feeling great yesterday, but I pulled myself out and went to the beach. Put sunsafe protection on and lay on the beach with the hope the vitamin D, fresh air, and general happy vibes of the beach might help. 

I woke up this morning feeling able to goto work. And given I enjoy work, which is a bit odd I know... I felt like my beach trip was a success. 

May be bull, but I feel it helped. 

Also, sitting inside in air con wasn't gonna help"
53903,Maybe you just need a vacation....? Disney released a short flick about a guy and work and the beach.
53904,"I'm planning a short weekend away :) unfortunately in Australia we accrue annual leave and I only have about 4 days at the moment but definitely planning on a cheeky trip once I have more days. 

In the meantime, local summer days at the beach aren't too bad :)"
53905,"Sunscreen inhibits vitamin d from forming though. I don't use it unless I have to be in the sun for longer than 10-20 min. 10 min without sunscreen is a great way to get your vitamin d on. And that short amount of time doesn't usually burn you here in Sweden.  

Though I might add that we only get the sun at the right height above the horizon to be able to form vitamin d between late May to early September. It's a short window."
53906,"I live in Australia. It's definitely in my best interests to wear sunscreen as much as possible. I'm jealous of your ozone layer... 

Actually, I think I read that Australians have a vitamin D deficiency quite  a lot of the time. But I guess that's better than the alternative around here for sure"
53907,Take a good vit d supplement!
53908,"I saw a graph somewhere that the ozone layer over Sweden isn't too great either. The official stance is to use sunscreen, but I never stay out in the sun for long enough to burn so I don't feel like I need it most days. 

The vitamin d deficiency up here definitely is bad though since we only get like 4-5 months each year where we can make it at all. I choose to go for the d instead of protection from burns since I don't stay out thar long anyway."
53909,Did you go in the beach?
53910,"FYI, though whole body sunlight will indeed give you a lot of Vitamin D, around 30,000 IU with 15-30 minutes exposure, it takes a *long* time for it to get from the skin to the blood.  And serum Vitamin D is where it does its best work.  So if you need Vitamin D in a hurry, like when you are showing symptoms, first take D3 supplements, which will quickly get into your blood.  Then sunlight on top of that is great."
53911,Thanks :) sunscreen for cancer safety and a vitamin supplement for internal safety :)
53912,But you can edit the Wikipedia and add it. Right?
53913,I don't like to play with other kids toys.
53914,Zing
53915,But zinc also has to be taken IMMEDIATELY (like within 24 hours) upon first symptoms in order to have any significant effect on cold duration and severity.
53916,I was looking for them
53917,"Well it is a wiki, update it!"
53918,Maybe we should be snorting the Zinc.
53919,"IIRC there was a nasal spray in the 2000s that contained zinc for exactly that purpose. 

It was pulled off the market and lead to a class action lawsuit by all those who permanently lost their sense of smell because of it. 

TL;DR - joking or not, don't put zinc up your nose."
53920,Zicam? I thought that was still around?
53921,"Zicam spray.

However there is a twist.  Zinc is very interactive with the sense of smell and taste.  In some cases, people are afflicted with a horrible malady so that everything they smell or taste is like garbage, but this can sometimes be corrected with zinc, restoring smell and taste to normal.

But like those who lost their sense of smell, too much zinc can be bad.

And yet with another twist, a common medical problem today is too much copper in the system; which can be corrected by taking zinc."
53922,"*You know what they call alternative medicine that was proven to work?  Medicine.* -Tim Minchin


That being said, I'd get a cold and/or flu every season followed by sinus infection followed by bronchitis.  Spent all the money at the doctor (who did nothing) and took antibiotics (when it was probably viral in the first place).

Then my sister received her degree in pharmacology.  As in, she's the chick the doctor's consult regarding medicine.

Always buy generics.  Never buy name brand unless there's a medical reason.

##Zyrtec (cetirizine)

It's an antihistamine.  When you first get sick, your nose runs.  An antihistamine will stop that before it progresses any further.  But if you don't...

##Advil cold and sinus (ibuprofen + pseudoephedrine)

So your nose is now stuffy.  You need a 2-punch.  Ibuprofen (advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It stops swelling.  Not only does it reduce fever, but it will stop swelling in your nose/sinuses.  The pseudoephedrine (sudafed) is a nasal decongestant and will get the gunk out.  They should be used together as the beginnings of a sinus infection need an anti-inflammatory so the nasal decongestant has a place for the mucus to go.

##Delsym (dextromethorphan)

Your sinuses are draining down the back of your throat and causing it to become inflamed (remember ibuprofen?) and it's making you cough.  This reduces your urge to cough.

##Mucinex (guaifenesin)

But if it's progressed to your bronchials and chest, guaifenesin will assist with breaking up the gunk in your breathing hole.  But remember, when using a chest decongestant, you're going to cough.  And it's necessary to get the gunk out.

So the moral of the story is you can buy a medicine cabinet full of generic drugs for a couple bucks and then take whatever you need, rather than spending big money on name brand combo drugs.

If you have a fever, you're contagious.  STAY HOME and don't infect your friends, family, coworkers, etc.  Don't return to work until the fever is gone.

And as always, don't take advice from the internet.  Go to your PHARMACY (not the doctor, he can't help you and all you're doing is infecting the doctor's office) and ask the pharmacist.  They are the experts on medicine."
53923,"Ummm I need to pick you or your sisters brain. I get this 3-4 times a year for like 2-3 weeks. I was told by the doctor I get post nasal drip and have a deviated septum.

1) I'm surprised to see this here because I thought most people only get a cold, and it usually only progresses to sinus infection due to poor drainage, is that correct?

2) Does an anti histamine almost always work for cold purposes? Because when I take claritin and such for allergies (allegra, all of them I've tried), they do almost nothing. 

3) For people like us, does it always reach stage 4 with a chest infection? I've been at stage 3 on and off for about 2 weeks. One day I'll barely be coughing, another night a cough keeps me up til 3am. 

4) Wouldn't an antihistamine stop stage 3 (taking delsym) since it stops music production? What is delsym, just cough medicine (cough suppressant?) Wouldn't both work?"
53924,"You should talk to a pharmacist (just walk into CVS, Walgreens, Duane read, etc and ask at the counter). 

But from my own experience:

1) yes. Our sinuses were not designed for us to be upright so we have poor drainage. Poor drainage leads to inflammation. Inflammation leads to completely blocked sinuses. Completely blocked sinuses lead to infections. 

2) an anti-histamine is not a cold remedy per se, but rather it's used to treat a symptom of a cold (runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, etc). Same as allergies. But it's only 1 piece of the puzzle. 

3) I'll most likely end up with bronchitis if I get a cold. But what was nearly 100% certainty is now better since I use the correct medication to avoid getting really sick. 

4) that's the general idea. Stop the runny nose at the start and the rest of the cold (sinuses, coughing, chest cold) can be diminished or avoided."
53925,What is delsym though and why do you take that instead of an anti histamine?
53926,"Delsym is a cough suppressant. Even if you take an anti-histamine to stop your runny nose, your sinuses will continue to drain. The post-nasal drip causes the cough. 

Each drug is for one particular aspect of a cold."
53927,But isn't it bad that we stop the draining? Because isn't the cough and snot for trying to take out the infection?
53928,"The antihistamine doesn't stop the draining, it stops the production of new mucus. Even after you stop new mucus, you need to get the existing gunk out. That's what the combo of anti-histamine + NSAID + decongestant does. It's commonly packaged together, for example, Claritin D is loratadine + pseudoephedrine (anti-histamine, decongestant). Advil allergy + congestion is chlorpheniramine + ibuprofen + phenylephrine (anti-histamine, NSAID, decongestant).  Some also include caffeine since that speeds up the effectiveness."
53929,"So to simplify all this, when I first get a cold, just a runny nose with no colored phelgm, take zyrtec to stop the production of mucus.

If it reaches sinus infection, take advil cold and sinus? I was desperate and right now I have a mild cold and took advil cold and sinus along with an anti histamine (claritin, not working) and nasal spray. Is that bad? My phelgm still clear."

53932,"I'm an ER doctor and I see patients with the cold all the time. I endorse your statement of asking the pharmacist first and buying generics. But also, consider calling a primary doctor on day 1, because you often can't get an appointment for 3-5 days with a PCP in USA. If you took your symptom meds and feel better, great, just cancel the appointment the day before. If you don't feel better, you now have a clinician to listen to your lungs and maybe get a chest X-ray in case a more serious illness like pneumonia is developing. Seeing the PCP is waaaay cheaper than coming to the ER. Your ER copay may be the same cost as a whole PCP visit."
53933,I love Minchin.
53934,"Best natural treatment I have been using for years.
The moment you notice your throat is getting sore/twitchy, gaggle with apple cider vinegar ( it has an interesting numbing effect) it is a harsh taste but it's great at wiping out a cold just as it starts.
Due to the extreme ph of it, do not brush your teeth for at least half an hour after using. 
As I've been using for years and my family won't use it, they get sick and I can control been sick 90% of the time ( hitting it ASAP is important )"
53935,I've had good results with heat. About 60% of the colds I've had in the last 8 years were treatable by hot nasal rinse or just bundling up under six blankets
53936,I dont see zinc anywhere on the list??
53937,I know right?  I'm shocked it's not on there.  Cold Eeze and Zicam work miracles for me.
53938,"+1 for Zicam. Once I think I feel a cold coming on, I start swabbin'."
53939,I buy the swabs and the tablets.   Kicks ass when I get a cold.
53940,"I tested these many times, cuts the length of the cold in half every time."
53941,"A lot of these remedies seem to be based on only one or a few studies. This isn't sufficient evidence to support the use of a remedy. I'd consider this a very nonconservative list, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt."
53942,Salt has not been proven to lessen incidence or symptoms of cold.
53943,Ay-oh!
53944,"whenever I feel a cold coming on, I give it the 1-2 punch with Airborne and NyQuil. I take Airborne once in the morning and then right before bed, I take it again with a shot of NyQuil. I pump myself up with vitamins and knock myself out with NyQuil.

don't overexert yourself during the day and get to bed early. It works like a dream"
53945,"Garlic is really amazing. I wish my stomach can handle it. They say you can take one clove in the morning, chew it and it's very strong. I did this for a few days but I felt discomfort in my stomach. Also the taste of garlic lingers in your mouth for a long time."
53946,You also sweat it out of every pore for the next day or so as well so everyone around you knows you ate lots of garlic.
53947,"Yeah, I know. There are garlic pills but I'm not sure if they are as effective."
53948,"You may have something called allium intolerance. Maybe if it takes a whole clove to make you feel it, it might not be too bad in your case."
53949,"I used to take it before breakfast and after I swallow the clove, I feel this horrible burning sensation but then it's gone right away."
53950,"Oh, what I'm taking about is more like lactose intolerance.."
53951,I trust **Horrendously Spicy Food**. Sweat till it hurts. Works great.
53952,I get zinc lozenges right at the onset.  One every 2 hrs. and I kick the cold.
53953,andrographis + echinacea + epicor + zinc gluconate = 💯
53954,"I'll give you a hint:

It's Vitamin C. For all stages."
53955,What has your experience with it been?
53956,My Grandmother always made me eat raw garlic when i was sick. That stuff works.
53957,"That's great. I think they should add Astragalus and Red Marine Algae. 

In MY HOUSEHOLD we use Echinacea, Astragalus, Red Marine Algae, and Vitamin C.  When we do get sick, we kick it within a week, 2 max(the 2nd week are the lingering after effects such as cough/runny nose). We never get the flu shots, and we never go to the doctor for being sick. Just a thought for others reading this.  

Edit - I'm deathly allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin(sp?). When I was younger, the Z-paks and/or Azithromycin worked the first few times but then did NOTHING to help me. I gave up on the doctors I went to and found my own solutions."
53958,"As a primary care M.D. this is where I find there is a big disconnect between patients and doctors.  Technically there is nothing that actually *can* be done for a ""cold"".  We say this all the time.  The M.D.'s aren't withholding any great cure or preventative measures, and what's worse ""idle hands is a devil's workshop"" causes a lot of over-prescribing of antibiotics. 

BUT.. (and I really mean it when I say I wish cost was not an issue).. I don't mind looking people over because people do come in with things they chalked up to a ""cold"".. but is actually something worse or more dangerous.  

I don't mind alternative treatments, and am not opposed.  I don't personally use them much.  And I do get the common cold 1-3x a year.  My unofficial-official recommendation is:

1. good health and some vitamins for prevention.  decrease exposure if possible.  

2. Ibuprofen 600mg or Advil cold 'n Sinus+2 ibuprofen for symptoms.  Dextromethorphan (w/ or w/out guiafinesen) for bronchial symptoms.  (like alka-seltzer cough 'n cold).  

3. Rest.  hydration. (edit in: cough drops.. surprised so many forget cough drops.  They at least help with symptoms: Halls, Fishman's Friend)

All colds will last *usually* 5-14 days depending.  With a possible post-viral cough (cough after cold) lasting up to 4-6 weeks (really.. it sucks for some people).  I actually like how the wiki-cold list correlates very closely to what I recommend."
53959,"> When we do get sick, we kick it within a week, 2 max(

So you kick it within the standard timeframe for a cold."
53960,"Bitch and complain until it goes away.  Trust me, works every time."
53961,"This is my method, and it has never failed me.  I also quarantine myself, so that I don't get others sick.  

If I know who got me sick I may subtly imply that sick people should try to contain their illness. How people are able to hang out in common areas, coughing all over everything is just confusing.  When I'm sick I try not to leave my room, and I Lysol the fuck out of anything I touch in common areas."
53963,"Very stubborn, can get angry.  I get sick more than the average bear.  I'm kind  of angry about this fact."
53964,"Unless I'm really ill I will not skive off work for a cold.

However, I will wash my hands lots, be careful with those disgusting tissues and generally avoid touching/coughing over common areas. But I do that anyway."
53965,I use this very remedy for most problems in my life. It seems to work moderately well.
53967,"As someone who works in a pharmacy, I agree wholeheartedly about the fucking meth-heads. We're pretty good at profiling now."
53968,You don't always get it right. I've been refused and I don't cook meth.
53969,"We also have a limit on what to sell everyday. I've had to turn people away when we can't have any on the shelf. If your toothless and twitchy, you're probably not getting any."
53970,"> If your toothless and twitchy, you're probably not getting any.

If that was the case I'd completely understand. I normally look pretty respectable, but I swear that day I was turned away because I didn't look healthy. It wasn't a drugged-up daze, it was goddamn influenza."
53971,I had an awesome doc who would write me prescriptions for the good stuff after it was pulled off the shelves in Oregon.
53972,"Last time I took some of that I felt like I was on a really good stimulant, though it did clear my cold up very well."
53973,"I drove through meth-country once during a move from chicago to florida, and the one thing I remember most clearly is the box of *REAL EPHEDRINE* cold medicine.

53976,"grate ginger root and boil it with some sliced oranges in a little bit of water to make a concentrate.  Add honey.

Later you can use the concentrate to make yourself a number of delicious cups of tea.  The ginger will have a little spice to settle your stomach and help with congestion."
53977,yes. i like to throw in a little cayenne pepper to clear the sinuses
53978,I prefer mine with lemon and a goodly shot of bourbon. Works like witchcraft.
53979,"Sleeping.  A lot.

Mostly naps on the couch, 12-hours of proper sleep, and about as much television as the human brain can handle in a day."
53980,"Indeed. When I go to the doctor for my colds, as required by my work, my doctor always tells me, ""There's nothing quite like the curative properties of a good night's rest when you have a cold."" He then writes me a note for an additional 2 days off of work and a prescription for prescription strength NyQuil to ,""knock me out.""  It's basically the original green death flavor NyQuil one could buy before psuedoephedereine was taken off the OTC list."
53981,">Original green death flavor NyQuil.

Fucking right. That stuff is nasty, but it works wonders."
53982,"Okay, ready?  Only my family and close friends know about this and it's worked for *everyone.*  Now I share with the world.  You're welcome:

Buy a half gallon of orange juice and drink it throughout the day until it's gone.

At the end of the day take a warm bath.  At the end of the bath turn up the hot water as hot as you can stand and stay in as long as you can stand.

Get out of the tub and, while still hot from the bath, go to bed and go to sleep immediately.

The next day you'll feel just a little bit better, but the morning after it will be like you never had a cold.

No go, tell others of what you have learned today..."
53983,I almost wish I had a cold so I could try this intriguing method!  *knocks on wood*
53984,Go out in public and lick as many door knobs as possible.

Either way, I get yelled at if the nurses and doctors find out, lol."
53991,"Good God, if you are on dialysis should shouldn't be doing any of these things!

You shouldn't be drinking a half gallon of anything.  You shouldn't be seeing how hot a bath you can stand.

Let the cold run it's course for heaven's sake!"
53992,"Haha yeah I can't actually have baths anymore anyway, I was going to improvise with an electric blanket for that part. 

But colds are no fuuuuun *whine*"
53993,Could be either or both. OJ has phosphorus and potassium.
53994,That might be why I'm having trouble remembering. xD Thanks <3
53995,Bad acid reflux?
53996,"Just curious -- why would you bother to take the time to post speculation on why another redditor couldn't drink orange juice?

Why wouldn't you just wait for the answer?"

53999,"I'm betting that the orange juice is for the vitamin C. Just take it in tablet form, I find the orange flavoured chewy ones to be quite pleasant. 
This is a well known remedy but do not use it for sick kids, raising their body temperature that much can be really dangerous."
