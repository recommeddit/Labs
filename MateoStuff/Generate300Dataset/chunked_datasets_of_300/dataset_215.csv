70946,The twist is very shocking though.
70947,"The twist being that she was switched when she was young? That's what crumbled the movie for me and a lot of people. Questions arise like; Why didn't she just leave the underground? She knew how to get down there she would know how to escape. Where did they all get the red jumpsuits perfectly tailored for their size? Instead of killing normal people, why didn't they escape and just cause a media circus to expose what was happening underground? What were the motivations for the people underground to kill their doppelgangers in the first place? What the hell was the point of revealing that the people underground control the behaviors above ground? Wouldn't that mean, if one doppelganger chose to run away, the other would run away too? What was the point to have the people underground laugh and scream like monsters?

The movie is so full of plot holes it's crazy.  It's a sad excuse as a social commentary horror movie."

Salvage (aka Gruesome) - (2006)"
71015,"I‚Äôve found that a lot of South Korean cinema leaves me completely unaware of what direction things will go.  So, the works of Park Chan-Wook and Bong Joon Ho are  good place to start.

Especially Park Chan-Wook‚Äôs revenge trilogy, as well as Stoker and The Handmaiden.

Other South Korean fare like I Saw the Devil and The Man From Nowhere are engaging stories that repeatedly surprise the viewer without resorting to cheap twists."

Japanese, but it has subtitles. An English dub is also available.

Disclaimer, it's my favorite film, I've seen it over a dozen times. I have a copy on my phone (of the English dub, my phone's too small for subtitles to be effective) I just watch *when I'm bored*. The twists (there are a few) still get me most of the time."
71049,The sixth sense was a founding father for modern plot twists imo
71050,"Half of the recommendations here don't have ""plot twist"". A plot that has twists and turns does not equate to a plot twist imo.

Also just the fact that a movie has a plot twist, is a spoiler in itself.

Sixth Sense

Unbreakable
 
Split 

Fight Club

Primal Fear 

The Illusionist

71056,"It has multiple actually. At least 2, but 3 in my opinion (depending on how you interpret the ending)."
71057,...I don‚Äôt think you know what a twist is
71059,Frailty 2001
71060,Fuck I love this film.
71062,"I knew it had a twist and I thought oh it's easy and guessed it. Well, the guess was right but the real plot twist was something I couldn't see coming at all."
71063,"The Prestige. Fantastic film overall too.

Arrival. A perfect twist that doesn‚Äôt feel like a cheat but causes you to reevaluate everything you‚Äôve seen.

Old boy. One of the most jaw dropping turns of recent years.

Memento. A modern classic for a reason - who thought that a film that goes in reverse could have a mega twist?

The Handmaiden. Genuinely couldn‚Äôt tell where the plot was going after the first 45 minutes or so.

Unbreakable. To me, even better than Sixth Sense!"
71064,My bf just watched Old Boy as well and said something similar! Thanks for giving the names and a really brief why you liked it :). Awesome!
71065,Old boy is the ultimate form of what you're looking for!
71066,The one with Josh Brolin or the 2003 one?
71067,I've not seen the Josh Brolin one but from what I've heard it isn't as good. The original is probably one of the most mind blowing plot twists I've ever seen in a film and I'm not overstating the point. One of the few films i would still be happy to rewatch these days.
71068,Im definitely gunna check it out
71069,"No worries! Tried to keep things oblique so as not to reveal anything. Love films like this, and including the ones you mentioned in your OP, so always happy to see a thread about them!"
71070,"Handmaiden is simply amazing. If any of you haven't watched it, watch it now."
71071,I really wish it had been given as much of a marketing push as Parasite because it really deserved to be recognised as one of the best films of the year
71072,It was definitely my film of the year.
71073,Agreed! I think it‚Äôs better but it‚Äôs probably to erotic to have won best picture
71074,It was too erotic for that level of marketing push. I would say it is one of the best films of the decade and i would be happy if more people watched it.
71076,"I absolutely love Parasite. My favourite film of the past year. I‚Äôm not saying I wish The Handmaiden was a success in its place, just that it got a similar level of attention."
71077,I feel had because i saw it right after Parasite and the vague similarities made me like Parasite less
71078,"The twist in Old Boy is great, but that hallway fight is what really inpresses me"
71079,Usual Suspects
71080,Great choice.
71082,The movie only gets good reviews because the twist. Its boring as fucking shit
71083,"I agree. Movie‚Äôs like fight club, arrival, se7en, the sixth sense, shutter island, the prestige, memento, predestination and identity are far better movies, more interesting, and much butter twists. The usual suspects kind of reminds me of Now You See Me because both have twists that seem good at first, then you realize they make no sense."
71084,Please put the fact that there is a spoiler *before* the spoiler itself.
71085,I did
71086,"Having the spoiler warning before the name of the character in question is what I was thinking, since just knowing that there's something to be spoiled around a specific character will cause most viewers to pay special attention to that character."
71088,Identity w/ John Cusack
71089,Oooo that is a good one!!!! Forgot about that one.
71090,One of my favorite underrated movies.
71092,"There‚Äôs always a batch of movies that come out in the same flavor once one does well. Identity isn‚Äôt the greatest movie ever, but IMO it‚Äôs well done and entertaining. For the genre, there are far worse choices."
71093,"I have never heard of this movie, lol. Adding it to my pending list. Thank you."
71095,You are absolutely right!
71096,Arrival!
71097,"Oh yes. I loved this twist and how it was brought. 

My boyfriend, as usual, was ""But... That was clear since the beginning, no??""

And it took 15 minutes to explain it to my parents who had completely missed the point."
71098,"Haha. I had the same experience. Explained it to parents but when I was watching with my ex, she called it like 25 minutes in"
71100,This one. Anyone who likes Seven & Fight Club needs to see this.
71101,This one should be at the top of the list.
71102,I just lost the game.
71103,Eastern Promises
71104,Saw
71106,The Prestige.
71107,"I second this, the clues are so well hidden throughout the film that it all makes sense when the reveal finally comes but you still don't expect it."
71108,If you watch it back to back the reveal is in the first performance where Bale‚Äôs character meets his future wife. Bale‚Äôs character kills a bird and pulls out a new one. But the little boy starts crying and says ‚Äúbut where‚Äôs his brother??‚Äù
71109,ooooooh so good. I'm going to have to go back and watch for that it's been a minute since I've seen that one.
71110,It's overall an insanely well narrated film. A magic trick in itself and I keep rewatching it even though I know the ending.
71111,One of the few movies that I've watched all the way through and immediately got up and restarted the movie from the beginning. And I still keep noticing new things when I rewatch it.
71112,Primal Fear (1996)
71113,"The Crying Game.  It was amazing when it came out because no one gave the ending away to anyone else before they saw it.

edit:  If you want to watch it, just don't read anything about it before hand"
71114,"Planet of the apes 1968, but I guess nearly everyone would know the twist by now. If not, enjoy"
71115,My copy of the film has that scene on the disc cover.
71116,haha I know right I had a poster of it. Still back in the day I bet it was a great moment if you didn't know
71117,"Its still a terrific scene. Adds a lot of poignancy to the beach scene too.

""A planet where Apes evolved from men? There's gotta be an answer""

""Don't look for it Taylor. You may not like what you find""

Yeah, no shit."
71118,"Yep I think that's why the ending still lands despite almost everyone having seen the iconic beach image. It's not just a ""gotcha!"" ending, it comes after the reveal of why ""The Forbidden Zone"" is restricted, Dr Zaius's cover up, and the implication of what mankind had done. So bleak."
71119,"Always loved Taylor's face when Zaius had Cornellius read the scroll out on the beach. He doesn't even try to argue.

For all Taylor's antagonism towards Zaius, he has pretty much the same opinion of man. The whole reason he was on the mission in the first place was because he'd become disillusioned with humanity. He expresses the sames views as Zaius does at the beginning of the film."
71120,"Eh, you never know. I still would never give away the plot twist of Psycho without a spoiler tag."
71123,Great choice! Saw this for the first time a few years ago and greatly enjoyed it

71131,It's a movie with insane plot twists.
71132,Is it really a twist though? A twist would be you thought you knew something and you were wrong. This is more a revelation
