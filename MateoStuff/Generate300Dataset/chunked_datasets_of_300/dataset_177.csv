58165,"Dior Sauvage is imo the best parfume ever made. Problem is it works so well that everybody has it, still won't stop me though."
58166,"It smells very good and i've got a lot of compliments!
Fortunately i don't know anyone who uses it as well :D"
58167,"This is my mainstay scent. I know it's super popular, but its subtlety makes it easy to wear regularly. That, and the closer people get to you, the better it gets.

I've tried other colognes, and many are good, but Sauvage has easily gotten me the most notice and compliments."
58168,My go to is Creed Aventus. Always get compliments when I'm wearing it.
58169,Was looking to see if anyone would mention this one hahah. It’s simply amazing
58170,"I 100% agree with this. I have gotten complimented multiple times. 

The downside - it's really pricey. The workaround I have is that I use Aventus on special occasions. My everyday started as an Aventus knockoff but honestly stands on its own. I've gotten complimented on IT as well.

Armaf Club De Nuit - Intense Man

Similar to Aventus - INSANELY cheaper. It's my daily driver and i still get ""what are you wearing it smells great."""
58171,"Tom Ford Black Orchid. 
I actually took it from an ex girlfriend of mine
Plus it lasts for a while on my skin"
58172,Moderation dudes. Moderation.
58173,Davidoff Cool Water!
58174,Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see this one. I've been wearing Cool Water for the last twenty years and still get compliments on it.
58175,"This is my favorite. Just goes with my natural ""scent"".

Also Halston Z-14."
58176,"many years ago I visited Japan and I’ll never forget the tv ad for this cologne. A guy dives into the ocean and swims and then all of a sudden the voice-over guy nearly SHOUTS in this deranged samurai-movie voice “Da-VEED-off Ku-OOL HWA-tah!”!

it was on constantly & cracked me up so much I still think of it every time i see the product, which is a lot bc my husband wears it. sometimes we just randomly say it to each other LOL"
58177,"Paco rabanne 1 million and jean Paul Gaultier Le Male

Both have given me decent compliments and while I prefer Le male, 1 million seems to get me more compliments comparatively"
58178,"Yes, Le Male is a compliment puller for sure."
58179,My boyfriend uses Versace Eros and I can honestly say that I've never ever smelled anything better. Even after a whole day's work he still smells amazing. Definitely recommend! (I promise the girls will absolutely love it🙂)
58180,"This is a thread I have been looking for! I want to add a secondary question, which cologne would prefer for work?"
58181,Aventus by Creed
58182,"I use Pi by Givenchy, and I've gotten several compliments on it, but different things work for different people. It's really dependant on your natural scent."
58183,"Luna Rossa Carbon by Prada. It’s right around $100 a bottle. I usually keep 5 to 6 different colognes around and it depends on who I’m with or where I’m going for which one to wear. YSL is also a good light scented cologne. 

Also, while we’re talking cologne I’ll take a moment to plug this advice; 

Cologne is meant to be discovered, not announced."
58184,I like the smell of clean clothes on men.
58185,Febreze Clean Linen. Got it.
58186,I always associate this smell with shit since my family used this as bathroom air freshener for like 8 years.
58187,Shitrus. Mmm
58188,Thanks Sean Connery.
58189,That explains it!
58190,"Finally! A thread I can comment!! I was a fragrance model for a perfumer (yes, it -used- to be an actual profession) 

Every single fragrance changes with each person. You can't generalize what fragrance would fit all people WITH THE EXCEPTION of a linear fragrance. The difference being that it does not go through the ""three stages"". The top note, middle, bottom note. A linear fragrance stays the same. Look at Hanae Mori for Men or Chrome by Azzaro. It doesn't change and will do well no matter who wears it.  They are two of my personal favorites and have stood the test of time. 

If you don't have a budget: try Aventis by Creed ( also perfumed by the Same Fragrance family as Hanae Mori ) 

ENJOY!! 

Edit: holy crap guys. Yes!! This is my passion. 

Fragrances are based on different things. There is a spectrum of Fragrance( like a color) : water, earth, air, green, floral, oriental. Within each ""color"" of the spectrum there are similar base notes- Amber vs rose vs woods. 
Everything is planned from the color of the water to the bottle. Typically a water fragrance is blue, grassy or green fragrances  are green. 

Let me read through your questions. I have a chest cold right now and I'm up coughing. 



Edit two: 
A fragrance model doesn't have to be a model-model yes, however it is very prestigious and you must be asked by a fragrance house account manager to become one. You must show an aptitude for fragrance history, notes and understanding of the industry. I was a certified fragrance specialist too. I did it for about 6 years. I have a sensitive  olfactory. It's a blessing and a curse. I do have a gift of recommending and matching fragrances to what you may like. 

Tldr: tell me what you like. I'll tell you what you may also like. :) ( cologne) 

Edit : I am on an iPhone and I'm running a fever. ( can't smell ANYTHING it is actually very sad for me ) I will be back in the morning. I really hope I helped a lot of you. 

Thank you so much!! Please continue to ask me I will try to answer you all!!!! 

Hey guys! I've been answering all day. Please be patient with me!!"
58191,AMA request. Calling it.
58192,Wow. That would be incredible. I don't have my laptop or my fragrance books I'm out of town
58193,I guess we knows your plans once you return then! Oh yeahhh!
58194,"can you recommend a cologne that says i'm swift as
the coursing river with all the force
of a great typhoon, with all the strength
of a raging fire, and as mysterious as the
dark side of the moon?"
58195,"Since you have worn fragrances for a living what part of the body is the best place to wear it and how much should someone put on? I always wonder if I put on too much or too little. 

I love Aventis and Mountain water. I have been using Creed for over 15 years."
58196,"I bet you smell amazing. You have fantastic taste. I actually have met the son of the master perfumer of creed, Hanae Mori and Cartier fragrances.  

Edit:  sorry I forgot your question ( don't feel so great) pulse points!! Never your clothing. That will happen as you wear the cologne. Spray your wrist, behind the ear, ankle, behind knee caps or palms. NEVER RUB YOUR WRISTS TOGETHER TO CRUSH the fragrance."
58197,"What does rubbing your wrists together do, why is it bad, and why is it popular despite that?"
58198,"> Spray your wrist, behind the ear, ankle, behind knee caps or palms

Is that an either/or, or an all-of-the-above?

I always spray behind my ear so that when you're in clubs and someone leans in to talk they get a pleasant whiff."
58200,I usually wear *Light Blue* by Dolce & Gabbana
58201,Both the men's and women's version of that smells good.
58202,Personally I like *the one* by D&G but it never seems to last more than 2 hours on my skin for some reason
58203,Try DG The One Desire. Came out last year. It is an EDP instead of usual EDT. Popular and lasts longer.
58204,And now Light Blue sales just rose 500%.
58205,"Light blue is my go to as well for summer, another one I really like that is really unique is bvlgari black, it has hints of rubber in it so it kinda smells like a bike shop, believe it or not it smells great though, was given to me by my female friend who was very much into scents."
58206,LIGHT BLUE IS MY JAM
58207,The smell of chainsaw exhaust and pine pitch.
58208,"I love coming home from work smelling like 2 stroke, chain oil and wood shavings."
58209,"As a female, I'm all for any combination of exhaust fumes and lumber. It's intoxicating."
58210,Ron Swanson?
58211,"Armani Code. I shower with a Cedarwood soap; the combination of Cedarwood and Armani Code drove my ex wild. After we broke up, she'd stop by my place occasionally just to smell me. Needless to say, she is stab you in your sleep insane."
58212,"> she'd stop by my place occasionally just to smell me

That's not why she came over.  

Source: female."
58213,Let me smell yo dick.
58214,"Y u comin home 5 in the morn

Somethings Goin on, can I smell yo dick"
58215,"Don't play me like a fool, cause that ain't cool"
58216,Although he did say she was crazy
58217,Out of curiosity what type of store do you find cedarwood soap at. I live in a decent size city so unless it is super rare I would like to try it.
58218,"Everyman Jack used to make a Cedarwood soap that was sold at Target. That's my personal favorite. They now only sell the body wash at my local store, which doesn't have the same lasting smell as bar soaps. So I've been purchasing from Amazon lately. Plantlife Cedarwood bar barely smells like Cedarwood, and it's a very small unmanly bar. I wouldn't recommend it. Mistral Cedarwood Marine is really nice for the price, costs me about $10 every 45 days. That's what I currently use. My current girlfriend really enjoys it. They also make a Sandlewood bar that I switch up depending on my mood."
58219,"I'm also a fan of Code... just ordered the soap, hopefully it has the same effect for me! :)"
58220,You wanna get stabbed in your sleep? Because that's how you get stabbed in your sleep.
58221,"I'm really surprised Armani Code isn't further towards the top. Smells Armani Code, gets extremely wet."
58222,Love your username. Did you sign up just to say you get wet for Code?
58223,[Mont Blanc Legend Intense](http://www.montblanc.com/en-us/shop/fragrance/legend/legend-intense-eau-de-toilette100-ml-111195.aspx). It's so crisp and impeccably *fresh*. It's like if you died under a gutter and were reborn atop a mountain.
58224,Gandalf? Sweet.
58225,How dare you compare the glorious Mines of Moria to a gutter!
58226,You have to admit: the place has gone downhill since the owner abandoned it.
58228,My GF bought this for me recently and I love it on cool days. Not a great one for ultra hot days though IMO.
58229,"Upvote for this. Recommended by a gay ~~guy~~ salesman, approved by the girlfriend. This smells amazing.

Edit:  Redundancy"
58230,"When shopping for cologne, I will *ALWAYS* walk past the hot girls to the gay guy. He always will let me walk out in better shape than i walked in."
58231,"Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille

YSL L'homme

D&G Light Blue"
58232,"Speaking of Tom Ford, Black Orchid is the absolute best night cologne I've ever smelled."
58233,"I have tobacco vanille, oud wood and tobacco oud. All marvelous. But my favorite is grey vetiver."
58234,Do you just roll around in money?
58235,"No, he bathes in it."
58236,"The YSL L'homme is by far the best cologne I've ever used.  Lasts a long time, too"
58237,"Issey Miyake - l'eau d'issey pour homme

I think this smells great and it's the one I've had most compliments for."
58238,I have that one and the sport version. Both smell amazing.
58239,"Just out of curiosity, what exactly does the sport version of a cologne even mean? Is it faster? Does it have more horsepower with race tuned suspension?"
58240,Sport colognes honestly just have more citrus or mandarin in them.
58241,"And less musk, since you're making your own."
58242,Racing stripes
58244,Girl here. Cannot resist men that wear this. It's so yummy.
58245,Not sure if viral marketing...
58246,That could be true of the whole damn thread.
58247,"Old Spice is taking a very unusual angle, if so...  
  
Old Spice cologne: Because she might have grand-daddy issues."
58248,"When a guy in the office or even on the street walks past me wearing Issey Miyake - l'eau d'issey pour homme, I can't resist stopping and giving him a blowjob."
58249,Oh come on
58250,That's hard to swallow
58251,"I feel like a fucking idiot.

I was in the middle of googling it to see what it smelled like. T_T"
58252,Jean Paul Gaultier. It never fails to make me turn my head when a guy walks by.
58253,"girlfriends favorite scent on me hands down, i'm like 200% more likely to get laid if I wear it, I've run tests."
58254,been my cologne for the past 10 years. Never get tired of it :)
58255,"I had that many years ago. Very nice smell. I first smelled it on some other dude and stopped him and said ""dude what the fuck is that? That's crazy."" Then picked it up at the duty free shop. Good stuff."
58256,clinique happy for men
58257,"my highschool girlfriend used to wear clinique happy. if i smell it on a girl so much as passing me on the sidewalk my heart breaks in a thousand pieces, and im 23. 

Edit: Holy crap, thanks for the gold..."
58258,I scoured this thread looking for my ex boyfriend's cologne so I could think about him and be sad.
58259,You kids should get together and find some happy smells to smell.
58261,"Hugo anything, I'm a big fan of the original"
58262,Hard earned man musk.
58263,"> musk

A strong-smelling reddish-brown substance that is secreted by the male musk deer for scent-marking and is an important ingredient in perfumery."
58264,We also eat [musk lollies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_stick) here in Australia for some reason.
58265,To attract a mate?
58266,"No, a cunt."
58267,that sounds like something I'd call my penis after walking around all day
58268,"Wait.. that's just an Australian thing? Remind me never to go overseas, I don't think I could live without musk sticks..."
58270,Dat supreme scent
58271,Gets the meat lovers.
58272,"Old Spice. Yes, really."
58273,"I don't use their body spray anymore but I love their *Fiji* flavor, I've been using the shower gel of it for years"
58274,Flavor😮
58275,You don't lick yours? There's a reason they make it blue.
58276,😛
58277,"One of my female co-workers said ""so not to sound weird or anything, but you smell really good."" I was wearing Fiji deodorant, not even the cologne. Haha."
58278,"I used to use fiji, but moved on to hawkridge when it came out because my wife told me it smelled like we were having sex tonight. 

I've gotten the same compliment at work, but I'd think they'd say that regardless because it's a mental hospital."
58279,"I use the cheapest of the cheap: Speed Stick deodorant and Old Spice cologne, and yet I've had more than a few female strangers tell me that I smell great."
58280,"It's because you smell like their dad. 

I guarantee it."
58281,"Yep! My man wears both (Oldspice or Speed Stick deodorant) and goddamn if I don't love how he smells with either on. He smells like man and him, and that's all I want."
58282,"I use Old Spice Denali deodorant, along with Target-brand body wash (I think it's like generic Old Spice Sport?) and Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength (sexy, I know).  I'm told pretty often that I smell really good.  I'm usually described as smelling like cleanliness, fresh laundry, and Old spice.  

Works for me."
58283,"As a lady, straight up traditional old spice deodorant in the pits. That's it. 

Get one whiff of that scent, my heart starts racing and my panties are done for.  It's caused me a couple awkward i have to go to the bathroom right now and deal with my dirty thoughts moments with guys I wasn't dating nor interested in being with (hopefully they didn't notice my blushing).  I think its a Pavlovian response via an association I made between old spice and boys I crushed on in high school."
58284,You can say teachers on reddit.
58285,Uh. I have decided to keep applying old spice.
58286,Works especially great with the girls who have daddy issues. Or even grand-daddy issues...
58287,This explains so much...
58288,Old spice and leather.
58289,Can confirm my Grandad wore Old Spice.
58290,Ooooooor it just smells nice
58291,No that's not it
58292,"keep in mind that what smells great on me, and is my ""go-to"" cologne won't necessarily smell good on you, and may smell completely different. lots of different factors play into it, and mix and match with scents you find favorable to wear, and see the reaction. that being said,

evening/going out - dolce&gabbana the one gentleman

light/summer/daytime- chanel platinum, RL romance, aqua di gio

everyday- chanel platinum, varvatos artisan, armani mania

i guess the theme is light, citrusy, fresh scents for the day, and heavier woodsy, leather scents for night. those are some of mine, and i constantly get compliments on how good i smell. 

also, stick to the 4 areas and nowhere else. inside the wrists and on the neck below/behind the ears. both sides. the only time someone should smell your cologne is if they are CLOSE enough to."
58293,"Beautifully said. I want to smell something good when I come near a man, be it good cologne or good soap. I do not want to gag in his vapor trail."
58294,"""A scent should be discovered, not announced."""
58295,"Paco Rabanne 1 Million

and

Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme"
58296,"> Yves Saint Laurent L'Homme

that one's actually a pretty great scent"
58297,"Dude here - that's what I wear, and I can't tell you how many compliments I've gotten on it. Funny thing is, my ex-wife bought it for me right before things went down the drain. Thanks, dear!"
58298,I hate 1 million but I just bought L'Homme last month and I love it so much. Wearing it right now.
58299,"Anyone a fan of fahrenheit?

I like the scent when it's diffused but when it's starting out it reeks of gasoline."
58300,Polo Blue
58301,Polo Black is amazing!  I buy it for my husband.
58302,Came here to mention Black. Shits the bomb.
58303,I'm surprised I had to scroll so far to find this. It's my favorite right now.
58305,Go google or go home!
58306,Azzaro Chrome Rules
58307,I didn't think I'd see this anywhere in this thread!
58308,Very sexy- for him
58309,It takes balls to go into Victoria Secret and walk out with a pink bag containing the cologne you bought at a women's underwear store.
58310,"This is, without a doubt, the sexiest cologne I've ever had. I always get compliments on it when I wear it out. My fiancee still compliments me on it when I wear it. It smells like you're going to get laid."
58311,Sex panther
58313,"I have 40 bottles of it... don't ask why.  If anyone wants to buy some at a discount, lemme know."
58314,A few of you have questioned my legitimacy.  I opened a box I had real quick and took a picture.  http://imgur.com/LwD6xid
58315,I'm disappointed that is the box boxes of sex panther come in.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expected but it sure involved more purple velour.
58316,60% of the time...
58317,..It works every time
58319,"I'm gonna be honest with you, that smells like pure gasoline"
58321,This is worse than the time that the raccoon got stuck in the copy machine...
58322,Illegal in my state =(
58323,It smells like a used diaper filled with Indian Food.
58324,It smells like bigfoot's dick!
58325,Pi by Givenchy or Hanae Mori for men. Sweet and masculine at the same time.
58326,"Pi made me follow a stranger around the grocery store and actually ask him what he was wearing so I could buy it for my husband. 

I am extremely fond of it, so much so that it was personally awkward when a coworker that I didn't like much was wearing it. I had to take a half day and go jump my husband."
58327,Came here looking for this. That stuff is delicious. 2/2 girlfriends agree.
58328,Terre D'Hermes
58329,Burberry Sport or Burberry Summer

58341,"Kenneth Cole, Black"
58342,"Acqua Di Gio for men By Giorgio Armani

As a woman every time I smell this on a cute guy I wet my panties."
58343,The problem with this cologne is every slapdick out there wears it.  You don't want your cologne to remind you of three of your girlfriend's ex-boyfriends.
58344,yeah. You most certainly don't want to walk around smelling like a slapdick
58345,> on a cute guy
58346,"Rule 1:Be attractive. 

Rule 2: Don't be not attractive."
58347,Rule 3: Be rich.

58352,"Yeah, i feel like the cuteness would override the smell any day"
58353,"One time I saved up money to buy this for my boyfriend,  and when I had enough I went to go buy it with my dad.  I had him smell it, and I told him I was going to buy it for my so. I turned around to look for something else, and when I came back,  my dad had bought a bottle of it.  He loves it,  which is fine,  but now I can't get that bottle for my so."
58354,Your dad's a smart man.
58355,She got dadblocked.

58359,Ahh the scent of highschool.
58360,">  cute guy


it might not be the cologne"
58361,"An ex bought this for me, my current SO knows this, so I can never wear it. I have like 3/4 a bottle just waiting for the pending separation."
58362,Seems like a healthy relationship.
58363,"> **Smells** like a healthy relationship.

FTFY"
58364,I mean... if you can't use it I can come take it for you...
58365,The SO or the cologne?
58366,I really love Polo Red. Dat smell
58367,"I've never even seen Polo Red but I can say Polo Black is pretty good, do you know how they compare?"
58368,"red is ""citrus"", black is more ""woody"" if that makes any sense."
58369,I love Polo Blue personally!
58370,"I think Burberry's Brit for men is the best I've smelled so far and would find the smell sexy on a man but smell is a very personal thing so I don't know if a man would like it as well. I smelled it in the store and not actually on a man, so I can't say  I thought of it as a manly smell, it was just a really, really good one."
58372,"YSL - La Nuit de L'homme. Honestly, you really won't regret buying this. I've never had so many compliments on a cologne before."
58373,Chanel allure sport
58374,"Chloroform, it works every single time.

EDIT: They always end up going home with me."
58376,I find Aventus better. Silver Mountain begins to smell extremely weird after an hour or two of having it on.
58378,"Ah, the smell of middle school."
58379,Omg yes. Every single boy I knew back then smelled of Cool Water. Reminds me of awkward kisses at the skating rink any time I catch a whiff now.
58381,Some of us were in middle school before axe hit the scene
58382,I had a boyfriend who wore [Acqua Di Gio](http://www.amazon.com/Acqua-Giorgio-Armani-Toilette-Ounces/dp/B000E7YK5K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323612632&sr=8-1) and I always thought he smelled awesome.
58385,That's because of the bits of real panther.
58386,"They've done studies, you know."
58387,Acqua Di Gio > Old Spice.
58388,"old spice $ < Acqua Di Gio $

im poor so this is the only point that matters lol"
58389,"Pro-tip: if you live near a Walgreens, they have a series of ""If you like (brand name cologne)...then you'll like (generic name)"". They smell pretty spot on. But if you ever have the chance to splurge, buy the actual kind."
58390,What if you're in bumfuck nowhere? Or Canada.
58391,"I'm a lesbian and I knew a guy that had aqua di gio on. I was like ""What is that AMAZING smell???"" And all the guys in the room swore they would switch to it because it attracted lesbians. True story, that shit is amazing."
58392,"Well if it's lesbian approved, it's guaranteed to get the bitches."
58393,"Came here to promote this one as well. I was briefly in a sorority in college, and we ladies all had an ongoing joke about how this fragrance was so good that it was the deal-sealer when it came to one night stands. We were only mildly joking."
58395,"Oh god, I don't know. Oceans and dolphins and rainbows? With a little bit of citrus or crispness to it, I guess? I'm not good at describing things like fragrance and wine. It smells good, trust me. But only in moderation, too. All things in moderation. I find there are a lot of douches who pile the stuff on, and that automatically invalidates its power."
58396,I agree. If a guy overdoes the spritzing it is definitely overkill on the nose.
58397,my roommate has a bottle of this and ive been using it all semester >:D
58398,"Hm, an Amazon link.... [70US$?](http://imgur.com/utmFD)"
58399,Agreed. Disregard Acqua Di Gio.
58400,but then you had another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend along with another boyfriend who wore Acqua Di Gio
59801,Came here to say this.
58402,I'm getting really upset that amazon doesn't allow me to smell things via the internet.
58403,Why is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Acqua Di Gio [frequently bought together?](http://i.imgur.com/ET2Wn.jpg)
58404,Dolce&gabana light blue.
58405,My roommate's friend just gave her a sweatshirt with that cologne on it and we're both obsessed with it.
58406,"If you're looking for a 'signature scent' which is an olfactory summary of your individualism, why buy something that quite literally millions of others wear on a daily basis?

Furthermore, for every woman who would lick your neck for a sniff of Aqua Di Gio, there is another who would chew off her own arms to get away. That's the problem with wearing a common fragrance - many people will have a negative reaction to it.

Do you want to smell like pure sex? Do you want to be an individual? I'd drop a few extra pennies on something by Serge Lutens, By Kilian, Frederic Malle or Creed. You could go for old world glamour by going for an older Guerlain like Habit Rouge. Bulgari Black is a personal favourite, it is utterly individual and won't break the bank.

Whatever you do, test, test, test! Put it on and wear it out. See how others respond. See how you like it. 

I own roughly 120 scents and am trying to write about these things for a living. Tell me what you like and I'll be happy to make suggestions.

For what it is worth, Aqua Di Gio makes me sick, but Old Spice is a classic."
58407,Do you know anything about Very Valentino? I love that perfume!
58408,NOT axe
58409,[Relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyRoLvUVHPc)
58410,You are going to have to go to the store and try different scents out. What smells good on someones boyfriend might not on you because of individual body odour.
58411,Nothing. Nothing at all. I like the natural smell of a man.
58413,I'm pretty sure she means the natural smell of a man *after* he gets out of the shower.
58414,"I honestly like the smell of a man's sweat but not for too long..

It tends to get sickening if it's been too long since the last shower."
58415,The smell of someone's sweat can apparently be attributed to how well someone looks after their nutrition intake and physical health.
58416,"I eat very unhealthy ... And I've found woman like my sweat smell. 

In high school and Uni after hockey practice before getting a chance to hit the shower I'd  always get stopped by friends. 

It took a while to realize, but it eventually became evident that my female friends would act more flirty.. Not all of them, but a good portion. 

Like I said the correlation between me being sweaty and flirty friends took a while to figure out, as you can imagine. 

I'm not sure nutrition has anything to do with this since again, I eat pretty piss more foods."
58417,And mood. People under a lot of stress have different BO than more relaxed ones. Inspiration and hard work... don't smell that great.
58418,"I smell like the body wash that I used after I get out of the shower, though"
58419,"So, is that considered ""natural?""

I've always wondered...."
58420,But *which* soap?
58421,"I use Irish Spring and TRESemmé shampoo and conditioner, and my girlfriend loves it. Really, really basic. Nothing special at all."
58422,"Hmm, I'm guessing you do not mean unwashed neckbeard smell.  You may want to be careful giving out that advice on reddit.  Unless, of course, you actually do like that smell.  In which case, carry on."
58423,"I was going to say this, as well. I have tried to buy cologne for my husband, but nothing smelled as good as he does naturally."
58424,"Best compliment I ever received: ""You have no right smelling this good in the morning"" after a night of drinking and waking up in her bed."
58425,"Whether how and why woman are attracted to the smell of man's is actually very interesting and there are some good ideas so far as to why, for example; 

Firstly it involves the sweat on a man and whether a woman is attracted to  this is dependent on many things such as the man's attractiveness, where the woman is ovulating or whether she has had sex with them. 

This is to do with sexual biology and has been influenced by evolution for instance if a men genetics make him look less attractive he is more likely to mate, if his sweat smells good to the opposition sex. Whereas on the other hand a man who is attractive, his genetics are less likely to be pasted on if he has sex with a woman when she isn't ovulating so to help this his sweat can smell bad to a woman who isn't. 

(i don't clam to know that much on this topic so I may be wrong on a few points but I thought some people might find this interesting)"
58426,"THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS.

I want to smell YOU not some synthetic bullshit"
58427,Soap.
58428,They all smell very different.
58429,"You'd be better off asking men what works best based on their experience.

With that said, check out Creed colognes.  Yes, they are expensive, but they are also incredibly complex.  I've had women introduce themselves just to ask me what I am wearing.  

You can get sample sizes for a few dollars.

58430,"Old Spice.    
My friend uses it and he smells amazing.    
I'm happy that I have an assigned seat behind him in class."
58431,there's a reason they call acqua di gio 'the panty dropper'
58432,They put everclear in it?
58433,and ruffies.
58434,"""You smell amazing! What is that smell?""

""It's the smell of fresh sea with a slight hint of roofies."""
58435,chloroform?
58436,"Ralph Lauren - Double Black. Amazing. Will wet panties, all over the show."
58437,"Guy here, I've always worn [Fierce](http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10051_10901_272918_-1_12232) and every girl that's smelled it says it's their favorite cologne."
58438,"After working at A&F through college, I swear I've lost a bit of my sense of smell due to that cologne."
58440,its what i use too! absolutely amazing.. my fiancee makes me spray it on hoodies every time im down to visit her so she can cuddle it and miss me..
58441,This. Fierce is my absolute favorite and never fails to get me going (and I don't even like cologne).
58442,"I've always gotten compliments with te following:

Very Sexy for Him, body wash 
by Victoria secretes 

And 

This one was surprising.. But the compliments have been stunning: 

Moves 
by Adidas"
58443,Very Sexy for men - I WILL not let my husband wear anything else. Upvote!
58444,"CTRL+F ""Curve""

.... hmm. 

I may have to re-evaluate my cologne choice."
58445,"Ah, the popular cologne in High School."
58446,Ouch man.   Ouch.
58447,"I always thought this one was popular. Time to get something new, I guess."
58448,The thread is young... only 140 comments.  Upvote it and hope it makes frontpage and let's see what a few thousand comments say. :(
58449,Sweaty Balls
58451,I have that one
58452,Try aqua regia. It leaves you with that deep clean as well.
58453,"Not a woman, but I wear Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford and constantly get asked about it by women.  That's a bit expensive, but the other scent that seems to work quite well is regular old coconut essence from The Body Shop."
58454,That is great stuff.
58455,Women seem to enjoy it when I rub the samplers from ESPN Magazine all over my body. Sometimes I get papercuts though.
58456,we've all been there
58457,Old Spice
58458,"TBQH I think for the younger male, wearing cologne is out. If you must wear it, use very, very little. I like Polo Blue and Armani Black. I've had a lot of girls really compliment both, particularly the former."
58459,Wearing cologne is never out imo.
58460,Great advice. For my two cents' worth: my wife loves my Bulgari Blu
58461,"Can also be read as 'Women of Reddit, please have singular tastes so I can adjust myself to them and not have to put in as much work'."
58462,"Yeah, because there are **no** popular trends at all."
58463,yes sir
58464,davidoff coolwater. I start following men when they smell like this.
58465,"Old spice. Yum.

Nautica makes a delicious cologne for men. It's my favorite."
58466,TIL Nautica was a good choice...
58467,Yes sir. Cannot keep my hands off.
58468,Chrome and Old Spice :)
58469,False. A web browser has no odour.
58470,"They usually smell of semen, unicorns and kitties."
58471,"don't forget the repressed memories, shame, and ramen."
58472,"(Calvin Klein) CK One

Has a very pleasant smell"
58473,"i know someone who uses that, its a good smell though"
58474,If it's 1996 maybe.
58475,"I came across a guy who I swore was wearing Drakkar Noir. I was blown away. I haven't smelt that since elementary school. 

Anyways, after I came on him, I suggested he try a more upscale brand."
58476,">after I came on him

ಠ_ಠ"
58477,"I enjoy Old Spice, but honestly my favorite fragrance is soap.  For the love of god if you just shower regularly you won't have to douse yourself in silly fragrances."
58478,"i assure you i'm a clean person, its always nice to have that extra kick no?"
58479,"People love my cologne, and comment on it all the time. Its [this stuff](http://www.menshop.gr/images/Hugo%20Boss%20Hugo%20Eau%20De%20Toilette%20Spray%20100ml.jpg), just Hugo Boss Eau de Toilette, and I just got mine at a local drug store. My previous girlfriends also absolutely loved it. Its good stuff"
58480,"I used to be a AdG fan/wearer (like apparently everyone else in this thread, haha), but my wife had me start wearing Boss. I dig it, a lot."
58481,My husband wears Hugo...holy schmoley the things I want to do to that man when he puts it on. Yummy.
58482,"The best advice I can give to any guy who wants to smell good is to SHOWER EVERY DAY AND BRUSH YOUR FUCKING TEETH, DAMN IT. Just be clean. Clean guys are so much hotter than un-clean ones."
58483,"i imagine i smell like 'nothing' when i'm clean, being clean doesn't have a scent its just nothing, that's how i feel about myself anyhow"
58484,But a clean guy is so attractive. If you're clean and can compliment a girl (and are not ridiculously unattractive) you will get laid.
58485,Fahrenheit by Dior. It smells amazing.
58486,I really like L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent
