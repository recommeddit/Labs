The active ingredient in effective mouth rinses is fluoride."
46918,What is the negative effect of alcohol?
46919,"The main one in the front on my mind right now is that it makes the negative effects of smoking worse by making it easier for all those chemicals to get into your blood system. 

Even if you don't smoke, the alcohol isn't selecting what its killing. It will kill pretty much every cell it comes in contact with, including yours. In the short term, its not a lot of damage, and the tissue in the mouth regenerate really fast, but it can make healing from something else slower.


According to this the following study, long term use of mouthwashes containing alcohol increases the risk of getting oral cancer. ""the use of an alcoholic mouthwash twice daily increased the chance of acquiring cancer by over nine times (OR 9.15) for current smokers, over five times for those who also drank alcohol (OR 5.12) and almost five times for those who never drank alcohol (OR 4.96).27""

46920,"The other thing that alcohol-based rinses may do is cause dry mouth, which (rather ironically) leads to bacteria being able to proliferate more freely."
46921,"It also dries out your mouth, which can make it more prone to infection."
46933,"What about your own cells? like mucous membranes?

What about lower concentrations than killing?  are microbes making poor reproductive decisions if I wash my mouth with beer, or liquor hitting the intestine deluted?"
46934,">What about your own cells? like mucous membranes?    
    
Tissue at the cellular level is not much different from bacteria so yes, some of it does get affected. As I understand it, the tissues are more tightly packed together and regenerate much quicker so it's usually not a problem.  It will become a problem if you swish with alcohol more than recommended.  
  
  
>What about lower concentrations than killing?  are microbes making poor reproductive decisions if I wash my mouth with beer, or liquor hitting the intestine deluted?    
    
Probably not advisable to wash your mouth with beer or alcohol since it contains carbs, which would probably counteract whatever antibacterial benefit you derive from it."
46935,Wouldn't that mean natural selection would create more strains that are better at embedding themselves into nooks and crannies?
46937,"Interestingly enough, John Snow (not the same) mapped out cases of Cholera in the late 19th Century to find where the outbreaks were occurring to prove that they were water-related. 

https://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/frec682/cholera/

> The workers at the brewery one block east of the Broad Street pump could drink all the beer they wanted; the fermentation killed the cholera bacteria, and none of the brewery workers contracted cholera."
46938,Cholera isn't killed by fermentation. Beer is boiled before it's fermented; there were no live cholera left to go into the fermenter.
46939,"The real kicker is how long it took people to link boiling water to preventing illness.

It's a bit of a mind bender to think that Pasteur was amongst the first to actually take it seriously enough to bet big on it, in not just one or two fields but three."
46947,Is there any theoretically life form that would be alcohol resistant?
46948,"Tardigrades (aka water bears) can survive immersion in pure ethanol when in their dehydrated state.  

https://asknature.org/strategy/cryptobiosis-protects-from-extremes/#.Wd4z8C9MEuo"
46949,Same with other spores and some bacteria. This is usually why Isopropyl and Ethyl alcohol based sanitizers are diluted to 70%. Some bacteria can survive in near 100% alcohols but not in 70%.
46950,An example of this is C. Diff spores are not killed by hand sanitizer. This is why you have to wash your hands with soap and water when working in a hospital
46954,What does soap do that hand sanitizer doesn't?
46955,"Hand sanitizer can't kill everything, so instead, you just use soap and water to get them off. Soap acts as a surfactant, allowing more things to be washed out and carried away from your hands with water."
46956,"In most situations you don't want to kill the bacteria on your skin. A healthy skin flora has many health benefits. Using hand sanitizer to strip your skin of this natural layer makes you more prone to infection and is generally unhealthy. There are situations where you want sanitized skin such as having an injury or if you are a surgeon, for example.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora)
Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either commensal (are not harmful to their host) or mutualistic (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient pathogenic organisms from colonizing the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's immune system.[3] However, resident microbes can cause skin diseases and enter the blood system, creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in immunosuppressed people.[3"
46957,"The soap doesn't actually kill anything.

Most of the bacteria and other organisms that are on your hands are sitting in the nature oil your body will produce on it's skin surface. Most soaps are made up of two layers, one of which attaches to any and all oil on your hands, and one which wants to attach to water. It causes all the oil, dirt, etc on your hands to be suspended within the water, which will wash away when you wash your hands off."
46958,"Soap will definitely kill things. It's not going to do the most thorough job of it, but it still acts as any other detergent and destroys cell membranes by pretty much the exact property you described (as the phospholipids in the membrane are amphoteric). Killing bacteria isn't generally the main purpose of washing with soap and water, but it definitely happens."
46959,I may be wrong but if I remember right it's the actual physical scrubbing of the water and soap that takes the spores off your hands
46964,The ethanol rewuires water to properly attack the cell walls of the bacteria. Think of using soap only versus soap and water.
46965,I remember the alcohol opens up holes in the cell wall and allows water to pump into the cell bursting it. Is that right?
46970,"For some reason I'm not surprised when I see Tardigrades as an answer to ""can something survive x"" lil' buggers are immortal"
46971,"Resistant to heat, ice, radiation, gamma ray bursts, asteroid impact, supernova"
46972,"Is therr any way to utilize that durability? Like, apply it to our own technologies?"
46973,Wasn't there a star trek episode about a giant tardigrade being used as a weapon or something?
46974,"I was expecting something much cuter (for some reason) when I saw ""water bears."""
46976,2:10 it has a little snoot! I can kinda see why they're called bears now.
46977,...Is there anything to which tardigrades *aren't* resistant?
46978,they also are the key to instantaneous travel to any place in the galaxy
46979,"> Is there any theoretically life form that would be alcohol resistant? 

Why yes, there is! In fact, it's better than theoretical, it's actual.

There was a [recall of alcohol pads contaminated with *Bacillus Cereus*](https://www.livescience.com/32937-recalled-alcohol-swabs-contaminated-with-bacteria.html) a while back."
46981,And there's a bacteria that's used to be used to convert ethanol into acetic acid (e.g. wine into vinegar) IIRC. Google seems to be telling  me it's called Acetobacter aceti.
46982,Do note the concentration of alcohol we're talking about here. You use 70% to kill. Not wine strength.
46983,"The real reason hand sanitizer says 99.X% percent is they can't make the claim of 100% and be safe from legal liability, even though 100% is largely accurate. Even bleach cleaner can't make the 100% claim for that reason, even though bleach *definitely* kills 100% of things."
46984,"Bleach is an intermediate level disinfectant. It's not the ultimate germ-killer that most people think it is. For reference, hydrogen peroxide is one of 5 high level disinfectants recognized by the FDA."
46985,What are the other 4?
46986,"Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, Ortho-phthalaldehyde, and peracetic acid."
46987,What tier is ethanol?
46988,"there is no tier list.  ""high level disinfectant"" may give the impression that there are mid- and low-level ones, but that's not accurate.  There are disinfectants that destroy harmful microbes, sterilizers that destroy all viable microbes, cleaners that simply remove debris, and ""high level disinfectants"" which destroy all microbial life period."
46990,what about fire?
46992,"Quick Google of FDA sterilants suggests the main sterilants are:

- Peracetic acid

- Glutaraldehyde

- Hypochlorite

- Hydrogen peroxide

- Ortho-Phthaldehyde

These would be liquid sterilant/high level disinfectants that you can apply with gloves. 

For the real killer stuff used to sterilise equipment e.g. vaccine/medicines manufacturing, they use gases which can get into every nook and cranny. 

The main one is steam sterilisation at elevated pressures, and for temperature sensitive applications, they use ethylene oxide (EtO), vapourised hydrogen peroxide, and EtO/CFC mixes. Naturally these are somewhat hazardous to human health, so the conditions for sterilisation have to be VERY tightly controlled - a level as low as 75ppm of hydrogen peroxide is ""immediately dangerous to life or human health"" for example, and that is one of the least toxic gaseous sterilants."
46993,"Isn't Hypochlorite a component of bleach, and pool disinfectant?"
46994,"Indeed. The FDA list includes hypochlorite as a high level disinfectant, though there is only one listing for it for the specific purpose of disinfecting endoscopes (hypochlorite is specifically good at killing c. difficile which infects the gastrointestinal tract which is where we stick endoscopes I guess). 

The rest are more widely applicable. 

http://www.hospitalmanagement.net/features/featureppc-disinfectants-hai-globaldata/

This site categorises hypochlorite as an intermediate level disinfectant."
46995,"So using hydrogen peroxide on my bathroom fixtures instead of, or after bleach would kill more germs? Or is bleach good enough, even though the peroxide is technically stronger, the bleach is killing everything anyways?"
46996,"Cleaning your bathroom fixtures with diluted bleach solution is plenty, but you aren't killing everything, even if you use bleach and hydrogen peroxide. Diluted bleach will kill e coli, staph, salmonella, norovirus, basically all the potty viruses and bacteria you would expect to encounter if you licked a dirty toilet (probably don't lick a dirty toilet). Well, all the ones you can reach, anyway. 


But you don't need to worry about killing *everything* because you and your family are safely ensconced in a body. Keep the bathroom mostly clean, wash your hands with soap and hot water, and you'll be fine. If you're feeling neurotic, close the toilet lid before you flush. Seriously, why don't people do that? Thats why there is a lid.  


Not having children will probably go a long way in keeping your face uncontaminated, too. Kids are pretty gross."
46997,"Bleach is a stronger disinfectant than the strength of hydrogen peroxide you buy in the store. 

If you could get pure hydrogen peroxide, you probably wouldn't want to play with it."
46998,Hydrogen peroxide at what strength?
46999,I mean it actually is pretty accurate. The chances of the rubbing alcohol reaching every single crevice of a surface and reaching every bacterium is pretty slim.  It may kill 100% of the bacteria exposed but it's hard to expose every bacterium to it.
47000,will bleach kill a tardigrade?
47001,"Great comment, and along these lines, there's generally distinguishing antibiotics, which we are worried about resistance development to, vs. antiseptics and disinfectants, which are broad-based antimicrobials. I even found a great review [here] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88911/), which states:
>In general, biocides have a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, and, while antibiotics tend to have specific intracellular targets, biocides may have multiple targets. The widespread use of antiseptic and disinfectant products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular cross-resistance to antibiotics.

So you'll see, the review I'm linking even asks a bit about the question OP's asking, as the mechanisms of action of antiseptics aren't as necessarily well known as antibiotics (although this could have changed more recently, this isn't my field).  Frighteningly, it appears that there are microbes that *can* develop resistance to antiseptics, depending on their methods of sterilization - but the review clarifies:
> In these cases, “resistance” may be incorrectly used and “tolerance,” defined as developmental or protective effects that permit microorganisms to survive in the presence of an active agent, may be more correct. Many of these reports of resistance have often paralleled issues including inadequate cleaning, incorrect product use, or ineffective infection control practices, which cannot be underestimated.

So the TL:DR; antiseptics/disinfectants are much more broad-based than antibiotics with generally multiple intracellular targets ('kills indiscriminately'). There are reports of microbes developing antiseptic resistance although it's mostly speculative. Instead, there are antiseptic/disinfectant-resistant microbes, depending on the method of sterilization of the agent."
47002,Also to note that our livers don't work that well on the kind of alcohol that's in most hand santizers. The lethal dose of isopropyl alcohol by mouth in adult humans is about 8 ounces. Methyl also kills us. Evolution gave us this particular resistance because ethyl alcohol is in fruit. Being able to consume half rotten fruit is a huge survivability benefit.
47004,"Sanitizers almost always use alcohol, which bacterial cells don’t really have any cellular means of developing resistance against.  You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)

EDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).

-  Alcohol doesn’t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn’t give a fuck about alcohol.

- Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.

- Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions."
47019,"Alcohol-resistant bacteria are evolving, exactly as you described:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140401/

It seems a lack of thoroughness in cleaning acupuncture needles leads some bacteria to survive and proliferate between cleanings. These then go on to infect the patient."
47021,The spore thing is more important here than nooks and crannies. Killing anything that can't create spores means the next gen will be spore producers. Meaning you'll kill the parents only to get a bunch  of offspring all over again.
47028,"So, relevant follow-up:
 why don't I lose all my gut flora when I'm drinking Everclear?"
47029,"If you actually drank enough Everclear to reach bactericidal concentrations throughout your entire GI tract top to bottom, you’d be dead hours ago.  But then again, you’re Gary Busey."
47030,Nutrition major: alcohol is absorbed in the stomach like aspirin. it typically doesnt reach your lower GI
47033,"For example the 2007 Darwin Award winner who succumbed to a 3 litre sherry enema: http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-13.html

EDIT: Sherry is usually around 17% ABV, so that's half a litre of alcohol."
47036,"wait, can't some survive that? How do bacterial spores work?"
47037,"Good question!  Endospores are basically small, dormant, heavily protected copies of the bacteria that reside within the confines of the cell wall, alongside the bacteria itself.  Alcohol will absolutely kill the main bacterial cell but the endospore will often survive.  Under the right conditions the endospore can grow into another active bacterium.  

A common bug spread in hospitals, C.difficile, is known for having this mechanism.  That’s why hospital staff are told to specifically wash their hands after contact with patients suspected to have this; the alcohol won’t reliably kill the endospores."
47038,"> C.difficile

This name amuses me greatly. Like they found a bacteria species that causes problems so they just named it ""difficult"" as its scientific name."
47039,"So it’s kinda like this: there’s a difference between antibiotics and sanitizer.

Let’s think about if you wanted to wreck someone’s car: you could do a small targeted attack (cut a brake line, drain the fuel, ruin the steering). For every strategy you choose, they can improve it (locked fuel door, etc). You could also take the less glamorous approach and just completely destroy the car baseball bat at midnight style. 

That’s what alcohol does, it’s the crude style, it’ll always work, and you can’t really stop it."
47041,"It depends on what’s in the hand sanitizer. 

The triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers. 

For alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol’s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol’s effect. In fact it’s so unlikely that it hasn’t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of. 

The 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin. 

Please correct me if I’m wrong or have any assumptions I should state. 

Edit: felt that further clarification of why spores don’t develop resistance was necessary.
You can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won’t react to any stimulus at ergo they won’t acquire resistance since they aren’t really living (so to speak)
They are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?"
47044,I remember reading [NASA was breeding resistant germs in their clean rooms.](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-319)
47045,"This is really cool, they're breeding bugs capable of surviving high temperature, low nutrient, high UV environments.  So basically bugs perfect for space travel."
47046,"There are two parts to this question.

First, sanitizer probably will kill all germs; the 99.99% is given to err on the side of caution, to prevent people from suing ""hey, I found 2 still living germs out of the billions I started with, you are making false promises"" (and proving that those 2 germs were due to contaminated sample or the sanitizer was not used properly is difficult).

Second, AFAIK it's impossible to be immune against the alcohols used in sanitizers; there's too much of it so that even a slight immunity would not be enough; all biological processes would probably have to change to be immune.

The same way biological systems cannot develop immunity against fire or strong acids/bases, they cannot develop immunity against sanitizers."
47047,"No. Alcohol basically nukes the bacteria. I actually did a research project in high school where I was looking at survival rates of bacteria after hand sanitizer application. That 99.99 percent figure is basically just a way to cover your ass if someone gets sick, because my results showed that it killed basically everything.

I did get a neat side result though. It turns out that bacterial genetic material can survive and be picked up by new bacteria after hand sanitizer use."
47049,"""99.99%"" is more or less a marketing safety net, as they can't just say 100%. The alcohol in virtually all hands sanitizers will kill any bacteria it comes in contact with, for reasons explained in other comments, but in the case of bacteria lucky enough to be missed when applying the sanitizer, it's just safer to say ""99.99%"".

Similar with the ""99.9%"" chance of preventing pregnancy with condoms. Sometimes pregnancy does occur due to user error or manufacturing defect."
47050,"""If you use condoms perfectly every single time you have sex, they’re 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people aren’t perfect, so in real life condoms are about 85% effective""

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms"
47051,"Note that that 98% means that for some sufficiently large number of couples using them consistently and correctly for a year, 2% of the women will get pregnant. It doesn't mean that there's a 2% chance of any given condom failing. Also, the gap between perfect and typical use is mostly explained by ""typical use"" being ""Sometimes we just don't feel like using one.""

0.1% is probably high for the failure rate for a single condom."
47052,"Since I don't think anyone else here has clarified the two words, the difference is between an anti-*biotic*, and an anti-septic.  Bacteria cannot build tolerances to anti-septics, things like bleach or alcohol or even fire.  They destroy the bacteria chemically, they make it physically impossible for the cultures, as well as most other life forms, to survive.

Bacteria *can* build tolerance to anti-*biotics*.  These kill the bacteria biologically - preventing these particular life forms from existing, some by targeting the cell wall, others by targeting the cell membrane, others by the bacterial enzymes.  

Also crucial, is that examples of anti-biotics aren't just limited to prescription pills given by your doctor.  You can find them in hand soaps and even in some hand sanitizers, in the form of ""triclosan"", which can build triclosan-resistant bacteria."
47054,"So, the issue with hand sanitizer is not that it isn't effective at killing bacteria, the problem is that it is very good at killing bacteria indiscriminately.

Bacteria live all over your body, inside and out.  Their behavior ranges from beneficial, to neutral to detrimental.  For most people, the vast majority of bacteria making their home reside on the beneficial side.

The reason for this is that even a bacteria with no direct positive (making food more easy to digest or whatever) but also no direct negative (making you sick) still use resources that prevents a directly negative bacteria from taking it's place.  These neutral bacteria provide us the benefit of competing with negative bacteria.

When you rub alcohol all over your hands you kill all positive, negative and neutral bacteria on your hands, which opens up a massive number of new homes for bacteria all over your hands and some of those bacteria might not be friendly.

So what do?

Don't use antibacterial soap for your hands (dishes, w/e).  Water alone removes a significant number of transient bacteria.  Seriously, it's between 50 and 75%.  Handwashing with soap and water is of course better and will get rid of 70-95% of transient bacteria (depending on study and what bacteria they're looking at).  These methods will leave the resident flora (for the most part) of your hands happy to live and compete with all the negative nancy's that try to enter to community.

The only real reason to wash with alcohol or other disinfectants is when you're practicing aseptic technique, either for maintaining pure cultures or treating people medically."
47056,"I thought Yellowstone was going to be some tired, lame, cliche 1950s vacation but it turned out to be awesome. The landscapes and geological formations range from otherworldly to stunningly beautiful. I'm so glad I went."
47057,IMO Yellowstone should be #1 on everybody's list.
47058,"My suggestions:

- NOLA: I didn't see this mentioned, but New Orleans, Louisiana may be of interest to you. They have a top notch football team (Saints) and some of the best food in the country. NOLA is known for the creole/cajun style food, but you can also find some pretty awesome BBQ places... For your girl, there is PLENTY of nightlife and drinking. Shopping around the city is also very *unique*. Not any theme parks though, however there is a Casino... There is really no other city in America like New Orleans. 

- Tennessee, as suggested by others. Memphis and Nashville are a few hours apart, but between the two, you will find some of THE BEST BBQ in the country. You will also have the Tennessee Titans in Nashville for your Football. As for nightlife/clubs/drinking, you should be able to find some places in both of those cities. I don't know about any extraordinary shopping, but I'm sure there are some nice malls... Also, if you like the outdoors, consider going further east (almost into North Carolina) to the Great Smoky Mountains. There is some great hiking and camping. 

- New York City. Of course I'm going to mention NYC. You have two football teams to choose from, the Giants or the Jets. If you go in September, you'll also have baseball, with either the Yankees or the Mets (though I'd choose to see the Yankees).... NYC definitely has plenty of nightlife and the best shopping in the US for your girlfriend... and while NYC isn't a BBQ mecca like the SouthEast, they have a place called *Dinosaur Bar-B-Que* which has the best BBQ you'll find in the North... There is so much to see and do in NYC, I promise you won't get bored!

- Off to the west coast, Los Angeles and San Diego California. The two cities are a few hours apart, but both are worth a visit. You have the San Diego Chargers for football. Both have excellent shopping and nightlife, and you also have some of the nicest beaches in the entire country! The food is excellent, though I cant comment on BBQ in particular... and as for theme parks, you have the original, iconic Disney Land. 

- San Francisco. There is no city like it. The weather is almost always cool and breezy. There is excellent shopping and great food (but again, no comment on BBQ). With a few hours of driving, you could be at the beautiful Yosemite National Park, which is definitely worth visiting. You also have the pacific coast which is nice, though it wont be as warm as LA or San Diego... For football you have a choice between the 49er's or the Raiders over in Oakland (I'd choose the 49er's).

- Denver, Colorado. I LOVE DENVER. You have the Denver Broncos for football, decent nightlife in the city, and some decent shopping. Denver isn't as well known for their cuisine, but they do have some excellent food! This is the city for you if you're an outdoorsy person because you have the Rocky Mountains near by for camping and hiking!"

And, it's not as if the distance between LA and SD is too far, only a couple hours, so both can easily be seen.... However, coming all the way from London, it may be better to spend a little more and drive the coast from San Francisco down to San Diego"

Nashville has a great nightlife for tourists. Just go down to Broadway and there are plenty of honky-tonks and other various bars with live music. There's also amazing restaurants.

47076,good suggestions but he should check out some college football. the atmosphere is much cooler than nfl games.
47077,"If you head to Colorado, head for Boulder. It is literally nestled against the side of the mountains, and although at times there's a bit of a yuppy/hipster vibe, It is one of the most beautiful places ever. Also If your into outdoor activities it has pretty much anything you could want. Snowboarding, skiing, snowmobiling all within an hour of town. in the summer and most other times of the year you can go hiking,  biking, rock climbing, canoeing, tubing, rafting(some of these are a little further up in the mountains, but finding a carpool is really easy.

They've also got something like 10 breweries within the city limits. I don't know how they compare to European beers, but they're better than any coors or bud beers.

If you don't know anyone around there I would suggest you get a hotel room in Broomfield or Longmont which are both right outside of Boulder. It'll be a bit cheaper and the public transportation system is good enough to get you anywhere.

Last note, it is a college town so there is a huge population of early to mid-twenty-somethings. Depending on what your into this could be great, or not so great. If you head there during the summer time it can be much quieter as a lot of the students are gone.

I lived there for 6 years, and am saving up to one day move back."
47078,"New Orleans is a must-see. There is nowhere else like it in the country. Great food, great music, beautiful town, awesome people."
47079,Come have some cajun grub in New Orleans!
47080,"New Orleans looks great, I just can't decide. Your country has too many great places to visit. England is dull in comparison!"
47081,The Grand Canyon is amazing
47082,"And Arizona probably won't arrest or shoot you.  It is mostly a myth.

/Phoenix resident"
47083,"Another Phoenix resident reporting in. Haven't been arrested or shot yet, either."
47084,"I think we need to make that the tourist slogan:
""Come to Arizona, we probably won't shoot or arrest you!"""
47085,Nobody will believe us until we replace Sheriff Joe.
47086,"Also, if you're a competent hiker, go below the rim, instead of just peering over it five feet away from your car.

Only four percent of the visitors to the Grand Canyon go below the rim, and that's where the most beautiful and profound part of the canyon is.

Of course, if you don't have any hiking experience, I would advise against it, since some hikes could be difficult and being unprepared is dangerous."
47087,"Thoughts from my three areas of residence:

* Head to the Pacific Northwest (Seattle or Portland) and take in a coffee shop on a rainy day.  The Solstice Parade is the most quintessentially ""Seattle"" event, if you're in town.

* Hit up the midwest during the summer and check out how they do a state fair.  The Minnesota State Fair is pretty amazing.  Deep fry all the things!

* The Southwest is a beautiful place, but full of crazies.  You can come to Phoenix and rent a machine gun.  But then, so can the slightly-off guy sitting next to you.  The main difference between traveling in Arizona and traveling in the third world is most of Arizona has potable water.  And you will need to drink a lot of water."
47088,"Boulder, CO is absolutely beautiful."
47089,"Denver and the surrounding areas are also great. I can't think of the town that the Red Rocks park is in, but it is beautiful, and it is right next to the mountains"
47090,I have alwaysssssss wanted to see a concert at Red Rocks.  I have the Incubus DVD from their show there a few years back and it looks like the most amazing venue I have ever seen.
47091,"Morrison, CO. is where Red Rocks is."
47092,"If you are in CO, then you must see the Rockies! They are one of the most beautiful natural areas I have ever seen."
47093,Denver is the tits!
47094,DON'T FORGET the national parks near by.. amazing views.
47095,the sand dunes are amazing :D
47096,"If youre going to Colorado, you should rent a car and drive down the state through the passes. Start in Denver...drive to Leadville through Independence pass down to Aspen and so forth through the Rockies until you reach Durango... Hitchhiking in Colorado is also insanely easy...The cities are cool, but going to Colorado just to visit Denver would be a waste"
47097,And its 70 degrees today!!! with snow of course still on the peaks.
47098,"However, not the best place for any of the things he listed. Granted, it is close to Denver, but then I'd just stay in Denver, it'll be cheaper."
47099,"Live nearby, went for the first time last weekend. Want to move there now."
47100,I LIVE THERE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
47101,Just moved away from Colorado. goodbye air... hello herpes water LA. lol.  just kidding.  not that bad.  *shhh it IS*
47102,"I am a truck driver and have been all over this Country, and my vote is to go to San Francisco and drive from there to Portland. So much win."
47103,IF you get the opportunity go to chicago Illinois. It is an awesome city with so much to do!
47104,I'm considering Chicago it looks really cool!
47105,"I strongly recommend Chicago, but I'm a resident so I'm biased. If you're considering Chicago, try hitting up [/r/chicago](/r/chicago) first. The sidebar has a great set of recommendations for things to see and things to eat. Also, little known fact: we have pretty solid beaches. They're beaches on a lake, too, so you get the weirdness of vast, mostly waveless, freshwater swimming spots.

There's a very strong redditor community here. People would probably be happy to show you around and take you out.

Alas, if your goal is ribs, you can get them here, but they're nothing like the ribs in Tennessee or the Carolinas. That said, consider Charleston, South Carolina as well."
47106,"Keep in mind Chicago is really big, area-wise, compared to a lot of other major cities. You'll probably need to rent a car there."
47107,"I disagree - Chicago might be the only city in the Mid-West with enough public transportation to get pretty much anywhere you need to without a car.

Parking for an hour in Chi-town is also horrible.  Parking at your hotel overnight in Chicago is also horrible.

Food for thought - if you have kids consider a car for convenience, but a young couple might get away with no car in Chicago."
47108,totally agree. I have been to Chicago a few times and never needed a car
47109,"Take his word for it, I've only been there twice. I was just amazed how long it took to get from one end to the other compared to Washington, Boston, Philly, etc."
47110,"BBQ is really different depending on the region you get it in.  Your basic styles are the dry rub kind (Texas style), your vinegar base (I think this started in North Carolina), and your sweet sauce (I can't tell you where this came from.  I see it lots in Kansas City, but I've also heard it was a Tenessee thing).  If you really want a full BBQ experience, you'll have to travel around.  If you want to drive around slightly less, I know of a really good Carolina style place in Lawrence KS, so you can go from Texas and drive up to Lawrence, then head out to KC.

If you dig on American football, there's a few places that are ideal to hit.  Green Bay Wisconsin, go to Lambeau Field.  Good luck getting tickets, but there's some damn good tailgating and it's motherfucking Lambeau Field.  Despite the fact the team has sucked lately, heading to South Bend Indiana and going to Notre Dame campus isn't terrible.  The atmosphere is still killer and, well, Rudy.

If you want to be deafened by a crowd, head up to Seattle to watch the Seahawks play.  You might suffer ear damage.  As a bonus, you can hit the fish market while up in Seattle.  The restraunts are amazing there.

If you want something a bit different with your drinking/shopping/football, try and be in Texas for their State Fair.  You get a college rivalry game along with unique food, drinks, and goods.  The other state fair I'd recommed is Minnesota's, though there's not a crazy football game to go with it.  On the other hand, if you want to try and catch a baseball game, Minnesota is a fine place to be.  The new stadium up there is gorgeous and pretty reasonably priced."
47111,South Carolina Mustard is sadly missing from your list
47112,"[Redwoods](http://i.imgur.com/JS8fW.jpg). I live in Vermont, and the redwoods and giant sequoias in California are the closest thing I can think to being on another planet. It truly is another land. Being there will positively inspire anyone with a soul, and certainly plenty of people who don't believe in them.

47113,"I can't recommend places in that part of the country to visit but I can recommend something to give you ideas! 

[Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFMTZrEhvlw&feature=related) is a fantastic, recent series produced by your own BBC. It's on Netflix streaming and on Youtube. It's split over six episodes, each covering a different part of our country!"
47114,"Oh quality cheers I will have a watch. I like Stephen Fry too, he is pretty funny."
47115,"Austin, TX"
47116,"And you cant beat [Saltlick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fih9mNJ3b-0&feature=related) for bar-b-q, just outside of town."
47117,SXSW is crazy this year. I want my downtown parking back.
47118,"One of my good friends is in Puerto Rico right now. He's renting his house out for *$1500* a night, 7 nights. He's practically getting paid to go to Puerto Rico, all thanks to SXSW"
47119,"Where does he live, down town?  I can see getting $1500 a week, but a night?  Seriously?"
47120,"Tarrytown, West Austin, near the lake . It's a big house so they're probably sleeping like 10 people. 

On the topic of SXSW I just saw Keane at some smaller show and they were great. That pudgy British man sure can sing."
47121,"Austin is incredible. The food, the nightlife, the public festivals, south congress, art galleries, kayaking, the greenbelt, etc... Plus you've got round rock donuts to the north and saltlick BBQ to the south only thirty minutes in either direction. Plus there's the longhorn football team! Definitely come here, I'll even offer my place for you to crash :)"
47123,"oh god, YES"
47124,Austin seemed like a city full of hipsters to me. Maybe I visited the wrong day.
47125,"This is perfect timing as one of my friends is there right now. 

The text he sent me yesterday was, ""Although infested with hipsters, Austin is pretty sweet."""
47126,"He is there during SXSW, when the population of hipsters is in incredibly inflated, but there are a lot of hipsters there anyways."
47127,"Can you please explain what you mean? What do you dislike about these ""hipsters""? What are you basing your judgements on?"
47128,"Yes, definitely Austin, and go to a UT football game while you are there!"
47129,"If you're going to go to Austin, you might as well drive a few more hours south and go see the Alamo."
47130,"nah, Alamo isn't as impressive as it seems like it would be."
47131,"The Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore on the Northwestern coast of MI was voted the most beautiful place in America for 2011. I reccommend it highly - I lived, worked and travel there often. Absolutely beautiful."
47132,"Big Sur, California. Drive along highway 1."
47133,"And if you have time, the Marin and Sonoma coasts, north of San Francisco, are also amazing."
47134,"Check out San Antonio, Texas. You'll find great BBQ anywhere in Texas. About 30 minutes northeast from San Antonio is a massive outlet mall in San Marcos, Texas. http://www.tangeroutlet.com/sanmarcos
Your gf wiill go insane there. The best name brands for ridiculously fair prices. 

Catch a University of Texas football game in Austin, and then go river rafting on the Colorado River. Then head over to 6th street, downtown Austin, for a night of drinking/clubbing. With your English accent, they will love you over there. 

Austin is a liberal city. Nothing like the stereotype of backwoods Texas. So you'll really enjoy yourself."
47135,"I agree with almost everything you said except I would go tubing on the river instead of rafting. But, I am lazy and like to drink."
47136,"As far as satisfying your gf, you could do a stopover in NYC on your way to some place else.  NYC has great sites, shopping, clubbing, food, Broadway, etc.  The NFL has preseason games in August, I think.  Check out the Jets and Giants. 

Don't forget to check out hostels... they do exist in the USA.  I suggest private rooms if available.

The US is huge, so depending on how much time you have pick out a few places to visit.  If you're into museums, history, and politics DC is cool to visit too."
47137,"NYC yes, Giants Stadium no. If we let the Brits see the meadowlands we'll never hear the end of it, wayfarer!"
47138,"The Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls (though best viewed from the Canadian side).  Doesn't really fit your specifics, but they are truly spectacular."
47139,"Visiting America next month for 2 weeks from England as well, going with three mates all 24.

We are visiting New York, San Franciso and Las Vegas. We have booked in a helicopter ride, have a hire car to drive from San Fran to Las Vegas and a trip round Alcatraz. Sounds entirely different to yours :P"
47140,That sounds great though! I would love to do all those things. How are you getting from New York to San Francisco? Alcatraz would be great to see. How much did this cost you if you don't mind me asking?
47141,"Internal flight to San Fran. 

Cost around £1,600 including the trips."
47142,Not bad... There are just too many places I want to go visit. Wish I could afford my own private jet
47143,"Don't we all! 

If your under 26 go check out STA Travel they deal with Students and you can get some good discounts."
47144,The drive  from Vegas to San Francisco is almost 10 hours just to let you know
47145,"Louisville, Kentucky in May. We host the [Kentucky Derby](http://www.kentuckyderby.com/). Major acts roll in to preform, the weather is (generally) nice, and there are a bajillion things to do. There's a bunch of new clubs in the downtown circuit, plus we have tons of microbreweries for casual luncheons. Tis a lot of fun. Promise."
47146,Judging by your username you know your stuff! Cheers mate.
47147,The Oregon Coast.
47149,"Stunning scenery, very nice people, and outstanding food."
47150,"I would recommend North Carolina as, well, I'm a native.  We've got a good variety of things to do here and the people here are some of the nicest people on the planet. Our beaches are beautiful and mostly undeveloped and some of the towns here have remained relatively unchanged since colonial times. 

The food here is also delicious. You have to try Eastern NC style pulled pork barbecue which is consistently voted top in the world. The seafood here is also amazing. goto  visitnc.com for good information."
47151,"Can't upvote this enough.

In addition to everything you've said, NC is quickly becoming a huge wine producing state. A lot of the tobacco farms are being converted to vineyards and the quality of wine being produced is very good; right now it's very similar to the Napa Valley scene in the 60s-70s. 

Most vineyards are still fairly small and if you go on a weekend you can oftentimes sit and talk shop with the owners as you drink some excellent bottles of wine."
47152,"Im leaving Carolina in two weeks...I will miss the bbq, okra, and Scuppernong wine"
47153,"I agree that NC would make for a good trip, though OP asked for a city and I can't recommend a single city in NC to spend a week or so abroad in.  However, if OP wants to fly into Charlotte, rent a car, catch a Panthers game, drive to Asheville, visit the Great Smokys park, visit some vineyards, drive through the piedmont, sample our fine BBQ, then finish up at the beach before doubling back to Raleigh or Charlotte for the trip home, well that could work."
47154,Sounds like we may have different interests... also I am biased because I have been raised in Northern California. But I cannot recommend Yosemite National Park highly enough. I also love the greater Lake Tahoe area. Everyone always thinks of palm trees and white sand beaches when they talk about California- but it is so much more than that.
47155,"Go to some national state parks. Out in western USA are some of the most beautiful sites in all nature. 

You think you've seen trees? Go see a Sequoia and everything else will seem like a twig in comparison. 

Not afraid of heights? There is a spot on the grand canyon with a glass walkway above empty space. 

The Rocky mountains are always a site to behold, as is all of Yellowstone. On the east-coast we've got the Florida everglades, the Appalachian trail, and Niagra-mother-fucking-Falls. 

That's just the tip of the iceberg. If you want ""cities"" to visit I suggest NYC, Washington DC, Chicago, STL, San Fransico, Denver, LA, New Orleans and anything else listed by folks here."
47156,"If you like beaches, then I would highly recommend visiting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Places like Kill Devil Hills, Nags Head, and Kitty Hawk. Those places are like my second home and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Also, you can get seafood AND Carolina BBQ. :)"
47157,"If BBQ, theme parks, and football are your only criteria, go to Columbus, OH.  They have a huge BBQ/ ribs festival, Ohio State's football program is solid and their stadium is one of the biggest in the country, and its not too far of a drive to Ceder Point, best theme park in the world."
47158,"If you want good BBQ I recommend Kansas City, Missouri or St Louis, Missouri."
47159,"This i was gonna say stl.  You have plenty of sports teams, the best BBQ ribs I've ever eaten at pappys (was on man vs food in the stl area) Siix flags for a theme park.  Tons of clubs malls and shops for your girl.  God i miss stl :("
47160,"My top cities would be:

San Francisco: Amazing food & beer, beautiful, lots of culture and a football/baseball team.  Gorgeous weather and lots of fun to be had.  Take the BART or rent a car and go out to wine country.  One of my favorite places, ever.

Washington DC/Baltimore:  I'm lumping them together because they ae so close.  Both have a lot of historical sites to see.  Spend a day in the museums, landmarks, and monuments in DC and then stop in Baltimore the next day.  You can see the Redskins play football or the Nationals play baseball, but Baltimore's teams are ""better"".  Camden Yards is considered one of the most beautiful ballparks in the states, and the Ravens are the home football team (Anyone who lives or has lived in Baltimore is crazy about the Ravens).  Check out Fells Point/Federal Hill, Mount Vernon, and the touristy stuff at the Inner Harbor.  

Chicago: a bitch in the winter, but it's another big, beautiful city with tons of nightlife, history, and excellent restaurants (Chicago style pizza and hotdogs).  In the summertime there's an awesome beach to spend time playing volleyball or just relaxing.  If you go there, find time to get a heavy metal burger at Kuma's Corner.  You won't regret it.

People say lots of good things about NOLA, but I've never been there.  I hear it's worth a visit.

I'd recommend seeing the national parks out west & the Grand CAnyon.  Awe inspiring if you are into nature.

As for Barbeque, I am partial to Carolina style BBQ."
47161,I agree with you about San Francisco except the weather isn't that great all year round. It's not San Diego weather which is phenomenal.
47162,Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. The drive between Sedona and Flagstaff is some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever beheld.
47164,"If you go South, youre going to have a hell of a time. just saying...Id recommend doing a loop starting in Atlanta (since youll probably fly in here if not NYC), Athens, Chattanooga, Nashville, Knoxville, Asheville (Ill buy you a beer if you stop by here), Charleston, Savannah, and back up to Atlanta.     pro tip: The North Shore in Minnesota and the Boundary waters canoe area...this is beautiful and underexplored.   

edit: The best thing about the US is its diverse landscape...Id suggest planning your trip around that and having the culture be a secondary concern"
47165,"New England is very pretty. Boston's a cool city, tons of great nightlife and shopping. From there, drive north along the coast. Portsmouth, NH, is a pretty town. Keep on going north. Portland, ME, is cool. Keep going north along the coast until you reach Acadia National Park. Absolutely gorgeous, especially in the fall when the leaves are changing (this basically goes for all of New England). 

*Edit. On the other side of the country, a lot of people have said SF, but I also recommend Oregon. Portland is a great city. To the west/southwest, the coast is beautiful. East is the Columbia Gorge and Mound Hood for outdoorsy stuff. Incredible places."
47166,"BBQ Ribs? Football? Drinking? There is one city that comes to mind immediately:

Washington D.C.

All of the major museums are free to get into, the national monuments are awesome, there seems to be five new amazing restaurants opening up there every week, and the city is packed with twenty-somethings who want to drink heavily and party.

Also, the East Coast is home to what is perhaps my favorite US cultural institution: [Five Guys](http://www.fiveguys.com/), the greatest burger joint to ever grace this wonderful land of ours. I live in California right now, and the stuff they have out here does *not* compare.

I'm not saying it's the only place to visit in America (far from it, in fact), but anyone telling you to skip the rest of the country and visit California is steering you wrong."
47167,Have an upvote for 5 Guys!
47168,"I took a trip last year that was one of the best times of my life (and was great from an outdoor photography perspective), but doesn't really fall under the bar/club category.  I recommend these places to everyone, not just foreigners:

* Zion National Park, Utah - There's no place like it, and the hike to Angels Landing is awesome
* Bryce Canyon, Utah - Stunning rock formations
* Grand Canyon, Arizona - 'Nuff said
* Red Rock - Sedona, Arizona
* Las Vegas, Nevada"
47169,"I personally think Las Vegas is a steaming shithole, but I completely agree about Bryce, Zion and Red Rock. Also Joshua Tree National Monument in the southern California desert.

Be aware that Arizona is being run by xenophobic idiots right now, so there's some weirdness going on. But most of that is directed at people who look like they might be from Mexico. If you don't mind that social ugliness, the natural environment in Sedona's quite beautiful.

Edit: Also, Taos, New Mexico is a great place to visit."
47170,"Northern Michigan. Everyone from Michigan [and probably not] is more than likely going to laugh and down vote me into oblivion, but I was raised up near Traverse City Michigan and it can be seriously gorgeous at times. 

There's not a lot as far as clubbing and what not. But they have the bays, the bars and the booze. It's pretty nice up there. Not too many people, a lot of nice nature and good views."
47171,"If you're in Kentucky, you can always go up to Ohio (where I'm from) if you'd like to go to some theme parks.  The two big ones are King's Island and Cedar Point.  While in Kentucky, you can also check out the Creation Museum, which is a good laugh.  Hit me up when you show up and I'll buy you a beer."
47172,"Yup, the best thing to do in Kentucky is flee to another state."
47173,"If he's in Kentucky during college basketball season, he should definitely check out a Wildcats basketball game. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing."
47174,THIS! I've lived in Kentucky for almost 20 years and Rupp arena is my favorite part of living here. I always get chills
47175,Road trip is the best way to see the States.
47176,Sierra Nevada.
47177,The Grand Canyon. You could a whole Vegas/West Coast thing at the same time.
47178,If you go to Kentucky go to mamoth caves. I went when I was a wee-one and still want to go back.
47179,"Only go to New York if you really make a commitment to walking fast and not stopping in the middle of the street. 

Sincerely,

every single New Yorker"
47180,"Just to be clear, you're talking Football-soccer, not American football, right? If you're interested in Football-soccer, try to catch a Sounders home match in Seattle. HUGE fan community there, and matches are a great time. In the Seattle area, there's also clubs, museums, shopping, and lots of hiking and outdoor activities. If you go in the summer, specifically late July through August, the weather tends to be absolutely wonderful - Highs in the mid seventies with relatively low humidity and sun. Great scenery."
47181,San Francisco/greater bay area is a must do.
47182,Jackson Hole Wyoming is probably one of the greatest places you will visit. Also south florida where i live.
47183,Nebraska! We have corn!
47184,"Denver, CO; San Francisco, CA; Austin, TX; and New York."
47185,"Boston MA.

Football team is the Patriots, arguably the best team out there.

Shopping?  Yes sir! (Faneuil Hall is great!)

Drinking?  Indeed, Boston (AKA Boozeton) is the place for you.

Clubbing?  You've come to the right place sir.

We also have the best Museum of Science in the world, and an awesome aquarium!

Edit: I almost forgot!  Here's Boston's [cuisine](http://i.imgur.com/kpOnA.png)

And in case that doesn't have you convinced, here's Boston at night.  http://i.imgur.com/jB2ma.jpg"
47186,"It really depends on what time of year you are going and what you want out of the football game. Better teams are going to offer a more exciting atmosphere (with some exceptions...) but the tickets will be more expensive and harder to get. Weather is also a factor here. If you want to knock out a few really cool cities in a row, I would suggest traveling from Boston down to DC. There are plenty of travel options here, and many great football teams along the way (mostly pro). The farther south you go the better BBQ you will find (even though I have had amazing BBQ in DC), however the locations are going to be more spread out. I have been to many games (both college and pro) so let me know if you have any questions."
47187,"And you chose Memphis?
Whoever steered you in that direction is not your friend.

Go to California.
Thank me later."
47188,"CA is great, but don't dis Memphis. I went last Summer. Great BBQ, music, and Graceland!!! There are several music museums and cultural centers. 

A few hours north-west of Memphis is Missouri. St. Louis is one of the most under-appreciated cities in the US. Just don't go July-August, the humidity is killer."
47189,Nashville is much better than Memphis.
47190,"> St. Louis is one of the most under-appreciated cities in the US.

I've moved around a fair bit and visited many cities in North America, and I would have to agree. Some great museums, great food, and one of the top beer scenes in the country. The OP's girlfriend can get her shopping fix and the OP can get the typical ""American south"" experience he seems to desire. Plus, since he mentions theme parks, it is worth noting that the city has a Six Flags location. 

To the OP - if you go here for part/all of your trip, send me a message and I can make some suggestions as far as where to hit up."
47191,I dunno we kinda came up with the idea ourself! I guess their internet tourism marketing is pretty good. Are there many big football stadiums over in California?
47192,"Skip everything else and go to the west coast, California. This coming from someone in the Midwest...... Unless you want to head to the west coast of Michigan & the Sleeping Bear Dunes on Lake Michigan, gorgeous."
47193,I have hiked the Sleeping Bear Dunes every year since I was 10. It never ceases to amaze me with its beauty.
47194,"Skipping the entire east coast would be pretty foolish. California is great and all, but there are some areas I've visited which I would have no desire to ever go back(LA for one)."
47195,"Yes, Beale Street in Memphis is great if you want a truly American cultural experience.  
You mentioned an appreciation of BBQ ribs.  There are several distinct styles in the US.  Do a bit of Googling, some are mustard based, some more vinegary, some more sweet, or hot.  They can be ""wet"", or ""dry"".  Someone else in the thread will know more, I'm sure.

I've been to every state except Alaska, and there's something great about every region.  Some of my favorites just off the top of my head are the Smithsonian, Mammoth Cave, Cedar Point Amusement Park, Yellowstone, the Rocky Mountains, and as you mentioned, Kentucky.  That region has beautiful scenery.  Chicago is often overlooked, but it is one of my favorite larger cities, as well as San Francisco.  

As for my specific advice, most tourists like the big cities, but I much prefer the trip itself.  I drive, and drive more.  See the US by driving.  Avoid the Interstates, or at least get off them and take the scenic route randomly.  This is the best way to see this country imo.  A week or two of driving and stopping wherever it looks interesting is my very favorite pastime."
47197,yay for maine!
47198,Mmmmm...Baxter....
47200,"If OP is looking for good BBQ, he has to come to KC. Plus, if you wanna go to a football game, go to a Chiefs game and tailgate beforehand. Some of the most fun I've ever had!"
47201,"I went to visit my best friend who was stationed at Ft. Leavenworth and it just happened to be the American Royal weekend- amazing. Also, the downtown scene was bananas, we decided to buy the bar a round of shots because we're from California and $3 shots on a Friday night was too good to not share, met a surgeon and his wife there and they took us to some great club and we danced and she called two of her single friends to meet us. It was great, the people were hella nice, and I always recommend it.

Plus, river boat casinos!"
47202,"Fuck yeah, Kansas City. I've never lived anywhere else, though."
47203,Big Sur
47204,"Crater Lake in Oregon, amazing"
47205,"Dallas. Six Flags over Texas is the original of all the Six Flags theme parks, the bbq here is awesome, North Park and Galleria malls are famous, and the night life is good too."
47206,"Colorado, regardless of the time of year, it is going to be breathtaking."
47207,DC
47208,"A lot of people think cities, but the natural beauty of the west is truly breathtaking. The Rockies, Grand Canyon, Arches national park, Redwoods, the deserts of Arizona. I grew up in the foothills of Appalachia and it’s absolutely nothing compared to the scenery out west."

47211,"If you're in Kentucky, you should hit up the [Bourbon Trail](http://www.kybourbontrail.com/). In Louisville, we have a number of nightlife locations, wineries in the area, Churchill Downs, and a number of highly rated restaurants. As for a theme park, I doubt Kentucky Kingdom will be open by 2013, but you could go for a day trip to Santa Claus, Indiana and [Holiday World](http://www.holidayworld.com/). For football, depending on when you come, the University of Louisville has a very nice football stadium but if you're looking for NFL football, we're not too far from Cincinnati (if you like watching the home team lose) and Indianapolis (if you want the home team to have a chance along with an air of desperation)."
47212,Damn no one said Massachusetts :(. My state isnt good enough for you guys huh? We're not all massholes I swear.
47213,"go to tennessee. best barbeque, good football, and plenty of crystal meth."
47214,or you can go to philadelphia and see where most of the big events prior and includingthe signing of the declaration of independence occurred. nice town
47215,canada
47216,Skip the rest of the US and go to California. You could spend a month there and still not see everything
47217,"For scenery/natural beauty, Yellowstone, grand Teton, and glacier are incredible, and fairly close together. You don't really have any mountains in England, do you?"
47218,"I can't believe the Pacific Northwest is getting no love here. Oregon and Washington state have so much to offer, especially in the summer when it's warm and sunny and absurdly green. A few highlights:

-Portland: one of the weirdest cities in the US, tons of amazing restaurants, powells books
-Oregon Coast: Gorgeous cliffs overlooking the ocean, backed up by temperate rain forests.
-Crater Lake National Park
-The Columbia Gorge: one of the most scenic drives in the country
-Seattle: awesome city, watch them toss fish around at Pike's.

Could go on but boss is coming back."
47219,"Dude, I have a BA in Geography and have been to damn-near every state in this country (not to mention, I've lived in 8 of them), but you're going to have to help me out.

Not picking on you, but you just said the equivalent of ""I want to go to Europe, see some cathedrals, watch a soccer game, eat pastries and go drinking"". 

BBQ, Football, Drinking and Theme Parks cover about 45% of this country, and that's a lot of country. Since you'd have to travel in the fall to see Football, can you answer a few more questions?

The BBQ, by the way, is the best for breaking it down. I could send you to Ohio for the other things. That would not be very nice of me. 

Football season is from September to December (plus January - sort of. Whatever). When can you go? Denver, for example, is a very different place in September than it is in December. VERY DIFFERENT.

But let's break down just a few more things:

Do you care about the outdoors/pretty scenery? If so, what kind? Lakes? Mountains? Rivers? Etc.

What kind of weather do you like?

Can you give a general timeframe (How long) and budget? You can even message them to me if you don't want that to be public, but yeah. Big country here."
47220,"Boston Massachusetts, best aquarium in the world. Plus am winning if you're up for it."
47221,"You can't beat Green Bay, Wisconsin for a football game.. The single greatest atmosphere for a game ever"
47222,"As a resident of KY I believe I can say parts of this state are absolutely worth visiting (it *is* Stephen Fry's favorite), however, not for  football (unless you're into collegiate sports), and not for bbq ribs (mutton bbq is particularly well prepared here, as is burgoo which is a KY stew often found at bbq shacks). I should take a moment to say we have amazing ribs, but that isn't what one comes to KY for. 

When you visit KY, come to Louisville.  It's the only U.S. City on Zagat's eight destinations that foodies must visit.  We have a top notch hotel/restaurant/contemporary art gallery. Bars stay open till 4am. 

Red River Gorge is one of the most scenic places on the planet, including Natural Bridge and Angels' Window natural arches. Get some pizza at Miguel's and chat up the rock climbers camped there. They'll be from all over the world.

Do the bourbon trail if you like whiskey. You'll get hammered. 

Come to KY in the spring. Any of the main cities will be just a few minutes drive from something beautiful. Daffodils and flowering trees practically cover the state, and there's nothing like a sunrise seen burning through the fog  of a spring morning , surrounded by redbud trees and stone fences in horse country."
47223,Seattle and NYC
47224,"Seattle, Washington.  It's a highly underrated city with some pretty fantastic people.  I have never met a visitor who didn't like the city.  And also, Portland, Oregon a few hours south is supposedly quite wonderful as well.  Furthermore, Vancouver in Canada is just up north!"
47225,"Pacific NW is great. Seattle and Portland are awesome in the summer. Beautiful nature, great restaurants and just straight up cool. 
    
San Francisco and New York, hands down are the coolest cities. 

BBQ is good in all over the south, it's really just a difference in style. If you wanna go to Memphis that's cool, but Texas (Austin comes to mind), Missouri and the south eastern states have great BBQ as well. 

Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio is probably the best amusement park, but there are decent parks in Texas and California as well. I think some of the Six Flags are reasonable."
47226,"if you're on the east coast stop by north carolina and visit charlotte... lots to do here.. including the us national white water center which is a fun place.. they have like zip lines and high ropes courses and stuff.. its freaking awesome! north carolina also has some freaking awesome bbq!!

47228,"Moab, the San Rafael Swell, Cayenta, Zion's National Park, Arches national park, all in utah. Some of the most beautiful and stunning landscapes in the world."
47229,"Southern Utah has some of the most amazing scenery you will ever see. However, it sounds like that's a bit away from where you're looking for."
47230,"If you want one of the best football experiences I'd say go to Seattle, WA.  Their fans aren't called ""The Twelfth Man"" for nothing. It's a blast.  I went there to visit my grandparents and it's a really cool place too. Lots of cool stuff, the Space Needle being one of the big ones.  It's also not going to cost you an arm and a leg like CA or NYC."
47231,"Come to Baltimore! Despite the bad rep that the city gets, it's not  bad. Come see the Ravens play, go to the Aquarium, the Zoo, the harbor, plus Fells Point has tons of bars. There is a tons of historical stuff, and it is in close proximity to a lot of other surrounding places as well. Plus, the best crabs and crab cakes in the country!"

47234,I'm thinking about starting in Chicago and travelling across. Detroit looks pretty cool!
47235,"Detroit isn't as dangerous as some people say, it's got some good bars and restaurants and a pretty great art museum. All kinds of strange flowers germinating in the rubble.

It's a little bit like Greece in that the primary attraction is visting the many lovely ruins. Also, it is bankrupt and negotiating terms with some Germans."
47236,"booming, beautiful city"
47237,"As someone from America, you really don't want to go to kentucky. It's dreadfully boring. You should check out San fransisco or San diego."
47238,"There are three places to go for barbecue - the Carolinas (pulled pork), Kansas City (all kinds of meat, sauces are what it's about here), or Texas(brisket). Anywhere in the south will have good barbecue, you just need to get out of the tourist traps is all.

Personally, for what you asked for, I'd go to Austin, Texas. Good barbecue plus it's a younger (age of people-wise) city and it has a vibrant night life, and all the things that come with that. Plus you're in Texas and can do a lot of stuff that you can't do in England, or other places in America even, such as go to a range and fire a machine gun (if that's your thing). Also, football in Texas is super fucking serious business. High school football teams will be on the same scale as professional events with stadiums and all the rigmorale.

Nashville, Tennessee is also a pretty cool place that has good barbecue and a decent night life, although a lot of it revolves around country music (there is a huge music scene in Nashville), so if that's not your thing, then you might want to go elsewhere.

New Orleans is an awesome place to visit in the Spring/Summer, and since it's located in the deep south, barbecue will be available and delicious.

Dallas, Texas has barbecue, an awesome football stadium, and ~~casinos (which are like grown-up theme parks).~~ However, it also has some serious violent crime rates. You probably won't be in any danger, but definitely stay alert.

Be weary of any suggestions in the northeast for barbecue (coming from someone in NJ). It's really not the same."
47239,I live and Dallas and there are no casinos here..
47240,"Skip Kentucky. Visit coastal California, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite (stay out of the Valley though in the summer), Southern Utah to hike and backpack, Wyoming/Montana, Manhattan, upper New England...oh and the Great Lakes region."
47241,If you want to watch a football game make sure you come in the fall or winter.  Do you want college or pro?  I'm not from Kentucky but some of my family is in Tennessee.  Plenty of historical attractions to go see in that part of the country.  Tons of hiking/camping & other outdoor activities as well.
47242,"I want to see a pro game! Are tickets hard to come by? Does the season end in summer? (sorry for my ignorance don't get much coverage in England, just the superbowl really)"
47243,"Should be easy to get tickets to the Titans.

Tennessee might seem to be an unusual choice but it is actually a great idea! Good food, music, etc. Nashville is the worldwide nexus of country music recording, and Memphis is a very important Blues music town.

There's some nutty hotel in Memphis that has duck bellhops or something like that. Also I think there's gambling.

Little Rock, AR is a do-able drive from Memphis if you rent a car and you could go to the Bill Clinton Presidential Library.

I don't know about Nashville but outside of heavily traveled downtown areas, both Memphis and Little Rock can be a little bit dangerous from a crime standpoint.

Oh yeah, any Simpsons fan wants to see Nashville's Fabulous Sun Sphere (it still exists)."
47244,Football season ends in February
47245,so bart simpson didn't destroy it :O well its settled were going to the sun sphere!!! (we love wigs)
47246,">Should be easy to get tickets to the Titans.

Not if they pick up Payton Manning..."
47247,"Good I would recommend a pro game.  Tickets can be hard to come by depending on who you want to see and where you want to sit (not really that different than your football).  The season starts at the end of summer and continues all the way through to the Superbowl in early Feb.  The cheapest games to go to would be preseaon games and they happen in late Aug. & early September. 

 However, they are cheap becuase the biggest players/stars don't play the whole game or don't play at all.  They are used to get the players ready for the season and for the coaches to decide on final cuts.  The real season starts after that.  Give me a second and I will find you a link."
47248,"Ok, so they don't announce the full schedule until late April so I would wait until then and then go on NFL.com.  If you are going to be in that area you previously mentioned the closest team will be the Tennessee Titans.  There are a few other teams in that area like the Saint Louis Rams or if you wanted to stop by Washington DC they have a team there as well.

If you have anymore questions before then or want the game explained to you I would direct you to r/NFL.  One of the best subreddits out there.  Everyone is super helpful and loves expanding the fan base."
47249,"It's a shame the games are all over winter, we wanted a bit of sun as well, but I guess late September wouldn't be too bad? Aren't there quite a lot of lightening storms around this time though?"
47250,"New Orleans. Unlike any city in the world, much less the US."
47251,"Bring your drinking shoes. Also eat all the food. It’s one of, and arguably the best food cities in America."
47252,"> Bring your drinking shoes.

Which reminds me: if a stranger there offers to bet you money that he can tell you where you got your shoes, he will win the money. Don't take the bet. Just trust me on this one."
47253,I bet I can tell you what street you got 'em on too.
47254,"Heh. I'd heard it before my first trip to New Orleans, but my very tipsy friend had not, and took the bet, while the guy side-eyed me with a half-grin.

Before he won, he said, ""First of all, I'll give you some advice: you never bet a man at his own game in his own town."""
47255,How... how does this work?
47256,"So you're walking through the French Quarter. You're wearing sneakers, sandals, suede shoes, or something that never needs to be polished. A man approaches you and offers to shine your shoes, and you refuse, because they are not the kind you shine. He says, ""Okay, how about a little friendly bet? I'll bet you [X dollars] I can tell you where you got your shoes.""

Of course he can't, you think to yourself. I bought these in a store out of town that he has never heard of before. So you take the bet. Then he says to you, ""Before I tell you where you got your shoes, I will remind you that I didn't say I would tell you where you bought your shoes, where you purchased your shoes, the store they came from, or the town you bought them in. Because where you got your shoes is on your feet, on Bourbon Street, in New Orleans, Louisiana. So you owe me [X dollars]."""
47257,(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
47258,"If a stranger is offering to bet, remember they do it because the bet will be on their side, even if it appears otherwise."
47259,Literally happened to me yesterday in the quarter.
47260,Haha. Yeah.  That's the only place that ever happened to me.
47261,"LA has the best food in the country, followed closely by San Francisco or New York City imo."
47262,Found the guy who's never been.
47263,Nah I’ve been. I just find there’s better cities in the country for food than New Orleans.
47264,"Welp, there's no accounting for taste, is there?

Bless your heart."
47265,"New Orleans is a great suggestion for food, music, history architecture and booze."
47266,"I'd like to add a vote for New Orleans as well.  Just know that the heat and humidity in Southeast can be oppressive.  

Another benefit on top of the food/culture/music/tons of stuff to do, is you could scratch your NFL itch while you're there if you time your trip right.

You also have the option of a short trip over to Baton Rouge to watch a college football game (in a conference that's known for rivaling or beating NFL teams for game attendance).

You'd also be a short trip from the prettiest parts of the Gulf Coast.  I'd recommend a couple days around the Destin part of Florida.  Especially as a way to recover if you party a little too hard in New Orleans.  On top of truly beautiful beaches and a different take on Gulf seafood than you'd find in New Orleans, there's other activities in the area that can be a lot of fun depending on your interests.

Can charter a deep sea fishing trip or watch the Blue Angels perform at home."
47267,"Best Orleans is legitimately unlike any city I've ever been to. 

It's simultaneously [the most hostile and least hostile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R34UjzJvJeQ) place in the world."
47268,Lies. Don't come. Worst time of life.
47269,Don't go in the summer. If you go in the summer it will be really clear why you shouldn't go in the summer.
47270,Heh. Keeps out the lightweights.
47271,"Charleston SC and Savannah GA are some of my favorites in the south.

As far as the northeast, philadelphia, new york city, baltimore's inner harbor, and washington dc are all pretty good."
47272,YES to Charleston!!
47273,"Savannah is lovely. Just don't come in the months of May-October. The heat/humidity might kill you. 

There's also no open container laws here 😎"
47274,"Philly!!! I love Philly/Baltimore because they’re a better representation of the east coast vibe than NYC (because as OP said, that’s a whole different world). Boston, too."
47275,">Note I don't want to go LA/LV

Reddit really doesn't like LA, but there is a lot of cool stuff to do here especially for someone from England who isn't used to the sun. LA has spectacular ethnic food, probably the best cheap food in the country. The areas surrounding LA are gorgeous. Santa Monica is a fun walkable city with lots of stuff to do and good restaurants. You can take the train to most of the touristy spots now. You can watch an NHL game downtown, there's a lot of cool bars around Staple Center (you can take the train down there too)."
47276,"New Orleans, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Portland/Seattle.   Visit those 6, and you will get a good feel for real America.   
  
NY is a global city.   Not truly American culture, and more a melting pot.    LA is not a fun city to visit.   It is so spread out, you spend most of your time driving which is not fun on a holiday.   
   
Vegas is Americans and foreigners getting drunk in nightclubs and sitting by the pool or gambling.   You can have the same experience almost anywhere in the world.   
   
Go to Chicago to see a big American city.   Lots of culture with museums, sports,  it is better for holidaying than other similarly sized US metro's as it has public transport.   
   
Denver is at the foot of the rockies, so you can spend some time in the mountains.   It also has it's own western culture which can be interesting.   
   
Austin is Texan culture, and a live music home.   Everyone should experience Texas at least once in their life.   
   
New Orleans is a great party town.   Get drunk, try some of the local food.  It is everything Vegas pretends to be, but is genuine.   
   
The pacific northwest (Portland and Seattle) are really friendly cities to visit, and different from the rest of the US.   In some ways they feel more European."
47277,">LA is not a fun city to visit. It is so spread out, you spend most of your time driving which is not fun on a holiday.

That's not really true anymore. Most of the touristy parts of LA (Santa Monica, Venice, Hollywood, Downtown) are accessible by the train and bike shares."
47278,But why would anyone ever want to be in Hollywood?
47279,There are some cool spots in Hollywood. Hollywood Blvd sucks though.
47280,"Austin is about the least Texan city in Texas and I grew up a short drive from Portland and there's not much special about it and in no way feels ""European"". I wouldn't recommend bothering to stop in."
47281,"But at the same time, something about Austin makes it 100% Texas too"
47282,"> New Orleans is a great party town. Get drunk, try some of the local food. It is everything Vegas pretends to be, but is genuine.

47291,"Come to Chicago! We’re a friendlier, cleaner New York with tons to see, the best food scene in the country, an exciting hockey team and a city that truly loves the sport."
47292,Upvoting as a Chicagoan. I've live in both Chicago and NYC for close to a decade. I prefer the food in Chicago. I love Chicago. I love everything about Chicago. But calling Chicago friendlier than NYC is a stretch. New Yorkers aren't rude. We just have rules. And you can strike up a conversation with a New Yorker at any time (provided they aren't busy). You can rarely strike up a conversation with a Chicagoan.
