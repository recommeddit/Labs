50570,"if we're talking about mixing and shit though, MBDTF was pretty fucked up"
50571,"To be honest I don't know what mixing is, what's the difference between that and production?"
50572,"Well, it depends on whether you're considering production in the hip hop sense or the regular music sense, as either camp can hold widely different definitions. On a simple level though, production deals with the musical while mixing is the audio. 

Thus, a producer will perhaps write string parts, book horn musicians and generally decide which instruments are featured on a track to get it to achieve its potential. A mixer takes all of that and adjusts the levels in order to allow those sounds to not come across as messy and to ensure everything is fulfilling it's right role. The producer will liaison with the mixer in situations where he wants specific tracks serving specific roles (for example, he may have recorded a piano part which is only intended to beef up the guitar melody line, thus it doesn't need to sit clearly in the mix and can be pulled way back). 

Hope that helps."
50573,put your definition in the description. hope you dont mind.
50574,"That helps a lot actually, thanks. Constructive posts like this are what really contribute to the general well-being and growth of a community."
50575,Awesome thanks man
50576,/u/pompsy this could probably go in your OP for the MM threads
50577,"Production in Hip Hop is more or less the creation of the music, usually just the beat.

Mixing has to do with a lot of different things, or at least it can. After Kanye records all the synths, strings, vocals, beats, xylophones and whatever, they need to fit together. You can't just use the raw recorded tracks, you need to change the relative volume levels, you need to change the frequencies within them, you need to change the panning, the effects, the phasing, and anything else you can do to make the tracks sound good together and to have it be the desired finished product.

Hip hop producers are by default mixing their beats, but not always the final track with the vocals."
50578,"Imagine a painting. Production is the actual painting of the picture, brushstrokes and all. Mixing and mastering is going back and making it all fit together. Stuff like ""oh this green could be a little bit brighter"" and ""this part right here needs to blend more into the background""."
50579,"what are you talking about the end of devil in a new dress is like the best mixing i have ever heard. you have violins, a soul sample, a guitar, snyth, and drums  and they all melt and swirl into one sound. they feel lie one entity."
50580,"The entire album has too much clipping and really detracts from the experience if you have a good rip of the album and a decent set of headphones and speakers. Just listen to the intro verse from Rick Ross on Monster, that shit clips so bad. Hell I'm listening to it right now and man does it get annoying once you notice it since it happens every two seconds on this track it seems."
50581,"I don't really know what clipping is, but Monster sounds different to me each time I hear it on different speakers/headphones."
50582,Dude that song doesn't clip at all. Intentional distortion is not the same as clipping. Not everything with electric guitars or fuzz is mistakenly compressed.
50583,"I think this would have to be my answer. Everything feels so deliberate, from the notes at the beginning of Runaway to the Gil Scott Heron sample at the end of the album. I remember buying this shit the night it came out and just laying there, listening. It was a spectacle in a way that I had never really heard in a rap album before and it was fascinating to me. It had an ambition and passion that you could feel and to this day I still maintain that the storytelling on the album, ignoring production, is rock-operaesque. It's like his Quadrophenia."
50585,"Being a studio engineer doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best produced rap album is.  I hated yeezus and didn't think it worked at all; I thought most if the songs on it were just annoying or abrasive.  
Mbdtf I thought was great from front to back. Each song was very different but it still sounded good as a whole. I enjoyed all the instrumentals a lot even though I don't think kanye is generally the best lyricist by any means."
50586,"Being an engineer most likely makes him more qualified to judge the production of an album, especially regarding the mixing and mastering."
50587,"> Being a studio engineer doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best produced rap album is

A studio engineer who is interested in Hip Hop is. It's like saying being a film director doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best directed film is. If you're qualified in that sector, of course you are more qualified to judge it, at least more than the average listener. 

Being somehow involved, professionally,  in production/mixing/mastering will definitely make you more qualified. Especially when most of what makes production good IS the correct use of audio engineering. You can be as creative and ""out there"" as you want, but if you can't adjust the mix to reflect the emotion of instruments used and make everything peak correctly then the production WILL sound shit."
50589,"The Fugees - The Score

Black Star - s/t"
50590,"Maybe not production in terms of beats but I really think as a whole in terms if production and mixing my favorite is Habits & Contradictions - Schoolboy Q.

Just the way his vocals are so crisp and bounce back from one another idk. It's just REALLY good imo I can't explain it."
50591,"Yo much love for Q, I can only hope Oxy takes that next step (this question should be reposted after the album drops)"
50592,i realized my ipod was missing a few songs and they weren't in order. when i gave it a proper listen i was impressed more than I already was. great album.
50593,Plus i really like the blessed beat.
50595,"Among new and old ones: Run The Jewels, The Low End Theory, Midnight Marauders, Live.Love.A$AP."
50596,Illmatic has best production. Take Care is the best mixed by far.
50597,Thanks for reading the description.  You're a rare breed apparently
50598,"Take Care really is wonderfully mixed. Very clear and clean sounding, but dark and somber at the same time"
50599,Blue note
50600,The Infamous. Not one second of bad work on that classic.
50601,"All the early Dre production has held up incredibly well over the years. The Chronic, Doggystyle, All Eyez On Me, 2001, SSLP, MMLP... 

That said I am always blown away by how crisp Doggystyle is. Top to bottom it can go up against anything new and never show it's age."
50602,this is the wrong place to ask this question. This thread is just a bunch of peoples favorite rap records
50603,"Recently: Acid Rap, Long.Live.ASAP, Summer Knights, M.A.A.D City

Classics:  The 36 Chambers, Illmatic, Bizarre Ride 2, Midnight Marauders, Born 2 Die,  Doggystyle

Suuuuper clean mixes and flow, just high quality beats that seem to be in the right place, albums I think where I think a good amount of the tracks could be hits."
50604,"Too tough to call but my top 3 (maybe)

Jaylib - Champion Sound

El-P - C4C

Atmosphere - God Loves Ugly


Honourable mentions: 

Blockhead - Music by Cavelight

Fugees - The Score

Cannibal Ox - The Cold Vein

50610,MOTM1
50611,My Name Is My Name
50612,"Unrelated, but this is the first time I've ever seen anyone type out the full name of the album. I never really listened to Pusha before and then everyone kept saying MNIMN and I had no clue what that was.


I had to google it like a caveman. But I respect you for typing out the full name."
50613,"Pretty cool how though how google still knows, most of the times, what you were searching for. I've been in the same spot when I first started frequenting this subreddit. You'll get used to them."
50614,GRoDT and the Black Album
50615,"Food and Liquor by Lupe Fiasco. Some great production with Jay Z, Kanye and Lupe himself. Hands down the greatest use of strings I have ever heard on a hip-hop album."
50616,paul's boutique - beastie boys
50617,Oneirology (Cunninlynguists) is probably pretty underrated.  Kno is an incredible producer.
50618,Gang starr- Moment of truth
50619,Liquid sword-gza honestly my favorite album production wise and im not a Wu-Tang stan its chronically slept on here
50620,Slum Village - Fantastic vol II OR Common - Like Water for Chocolate

Jay Z - Blueprint
Pusha T- MNINM
A$AP Rocky - Long Live A$AP

There are plenty more. These are the ones that just came into mind."
50626,"Hm.

Illmatic
The Cold Vein
Madvilliany
I'll Sleep When You're Dead
Skelethon

It's almost impossible for me to narrow it down to one, because of the myriad of styles, techniques and different factors that play into all of them."
50627,"GKMC had some of the best beats and amazing mastering. It seriously never gets old...,"
50628,"I'm going to throw a curveball here.

A Tribe Called Quest- Midnight Marauders was one of my choices... but I've come to the conclusion that..

De La Soul- Stakes is High . First De La album without Prince Paul on the boards... and it beats everything that he's produced. Covers many sounds of hip hop, and has aged better than fine wine."
50629,"My favorite de la, production wise"
50630,"Like him or not but I think that Ryan Lewis did create a masterpiece with Macklemore's ""The Heist""."
50631,I don't think anyone here doesn't rate ryan lewis's ability to make a beat
50632,Drake - Nothing was the same. Hit me.
50633,"They don't go by order:

* Get Rich or Get Die Tryin'
* Marshal Mather's LP
* Relapse
* 2001
* The Documentary
* The Massacre

50634,"stankonia, i've never heard something as sonically pleasing. by no means my favourite 'kast album but imo the most deep sounding."
50635,I'd probably say Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP. Dre said it was his best work.  Also the N.W.A niggazforlife album. Great production all around in these albums.
50636,"Long live ASAP, I'm on my phone... His SECOND album that is. Close second would be midnight marauders, powers is the man"
50637,"Not the best I think, but those two are definitely up there though."
50638,"Stunts, blunts, and hip-hop"
50639,I feel like E.1999 Eternal is up there especially for their time. brilliant album. otherwise all the others are mentioned here.
50640,"I would choose Madvillainy, Liquid Swords or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy."
50641,"Beats, Rhymes, and life - A Tribe Called Quest"

50643,"I know this is not the correct thread to ask, but my question doesn't meet the requirements for its own post so i figure a stickied thread my give me my answer. im looking for a song

around like ~2016 there was a white dude who had a song blow up, he kinda looked like a taller skinner landon cube. The video was in a parking garage i think? then it cut to a party scene and the 2nd verse was trash. is this ringing a bell for anyone? it was kinda a banger but i cant remember the lyrics or title."

Olivia Rodrigo - Sour (Really enjoyed her songwriting on this ngl)



Hip Hop 

Madlib - Sound Ancestors (Maybe AOTY I love Madlib)

Playboi Carti - Whole Lotta Red (Fuck you the majority of my time listening to this has been in 2021)

Mike Dean - 4:22 (Crazy synth work with only a few tracks with drums. Still super cool sounds highly reccomend. Any time he puts synths on top of that long guitar ""shoegazey"" reverb in songs I want to cum) 

J Cole - The Offseason (Find my self going back to this still so I must enjoy it. Not a lot of ""playlist songs"" tho.) 



Need to start looking at more recent stuff instead of diving into my old shit as much it seems. Recently been listening to the Lil Baby/Durk album and I think its decent as well. Really looking forward to the new Baby Keem album as well."
50652,Thanks. I like Olivia and floating points. Gonna try spirit of the beehive next.

I only go as far as DatPiff to find new artists. Other than that it’s just what XXL tells me was released this week or HipHopDX."
50673,Datpiff or where can I find them? Never heard of any.
50674,"Well they're albums so I'd check Spotify or if you can't do that then try the high seas 

I'd also throw in Benny's Plugs I Met 2 and Conway,'s 2 albums that he just dropped if you're into the drug/gangster rap but because of your suggestion I avoided those"
50675,"I’ve listened to Benny’s album. I’m a Freddie Gibbs, Nipsey Hussle, Don Trip, Starlito type of listener. Fabulous and Luda.

Lloyd Banks new one was nice, too."
50676,"I agree it isn’t been as impressive as years past, but there are definitely albums “worth mentioning” outside of the super underground album you mentioned"
50677,Send some my way.
50678,"Outside of the obvious (The off-season, Pray for Haiti), Haram, any of the Conway albums (I’ll name La Maquina as my fave), the plugs I met 2, TYRON, Roadrunner. Maybe not some of the best albums of all time (not the biggest brockhampton fan) but those are all really well-received albums"
50679,"Ah The Plugs I Met 2 was nice. Forgot about that one.

Lloyd Banks just dropped. Not too shabby."
50680,"Love the Lloyd album, didn’t include it because it doesn’t have much mainstream appeal"
50681,"Fun Ones, #3

This is the year I finally got into Lil Baby. I know I'm like 2-3 years behind but I just couldn't get into him back then. Then I heard Voice of the Heroes as a single it all just clicked for me. The VOTH album itself was pretty solid, been a fan of Durk for almost a decade, but the real treat was going on to listen to My Turn with this new perspective. I completely get the hype and in a way, being late is a blessing because I now have an insanely stacked back-catalog to go through. Also feels nice knowing that I'm choosing to remain open-minded, even if takes me a bit longer to get on board with the new shit than when I was younger."
50682,"calling in a favor from all my real hip hip heads..

what are the best GROUP projects so far this year?

i can think of:

brockhampton..

the recently released 'juneteenth: freedom songs' compilation..

[and perhaps THIS mixtape?](https://soundcloud.com/rmakinghiphop/sets/mhh-2020-tape)

am i missing any others?

seems like a slow year but it's crazy if the r/makinghiphop tape is in the top 3 lol"

50684,"Best albums to me in no particular order are Mach Hommy, Slowthai and that killer project Flee Lord dropped with DJ Muggs. Alchemist This Thing of Ours is worth every minute too but it's too damn short"

4. Thought Michigan Boy Boat was fun and I don't normally like Yachty, doesn't seem like people were so big on it

5. **Easily** The Crashing Sound of How It Goes by Cities Aviv, if you like Shabazz Palaces or Some Rap Songs check this record out. It's one of the year's best albums too but I didn't want to double dip. The Jim Jones/Harry Fraud album was nice as well"
50699,That Wayne feature is definitely a standout this year
50700,"Honestly this years been pretty slow. The only albums I'd consider for AOTY are:

Conway The Machine - Le Maquina

50706,"1. Smiling With No Teeth by Genesis Owusu is great front to back, nothing but hits

2. BUZZCUT is the best beat Brockhampton's had in forever, absolutely addictive

3. Denzel on the Bruuuh remix (tbh there haven't been many features that've stood out to me this year)


4. Danny's first verse on Welfare is ridiculous, would love an entire album where he's in ODB mode

5. NAINAINAI by ATARASHII GAKKO isn't usually my sound but that entire song is just addictive

6. the original cover isn't it but the deluxe Roadrunner cover is gorgeous

7. Unlocked 1.5, none of the beats fit as well as the originals and most of the features were mid - no reason to go back to it when the original is so much better

8. The Koreatown Oddity! Little Dominique's Nosebleed was one of last year's best albums and I totally missed it

9. I don't seem to like the new Slowthai as much as everybody else - thought it was fine but a lot of the songs seemed underdeveloped and half baked to me

Best Album Cover: Lil Yachty - Michigan Boy Boat

Worst Album: Trippie Redd - Neon Shark

Fav Artist I've Discovered: Foushee or Sinead Harnett"
50708,That Kota album was really nice and I somehow had forgotten how much I liked it. He always manages to make me smile on some Devin Tha Dude type shit
50709,Thank you for putting Gold Fronts on there that songs crazy good
50710,"1. I liked Khaled khaled wasn’t that bad but best album so far is slime language 2 

2. Best beat is easily miss the rage by trippie redd and playboi carti so far 

3. It’s in contention with  paid the fine by thug baby and gunna and don toliver with gunna and uzi on his and hers and also khaled with nas and jay z   Out of those three I think paid the fine was kinda ruined by trench as with don toliver ans gunna and uzi they did they thing but I feel like toliver outshine all of em on the track but this is the most fun song on the list to me but I feel like nas and jay z had the best feature because it was unexpected and it is legendary that these once rivals became allies to make a classy cool track 

4. Best verse was lil Wayne In seeing green has many witty verses you pick lol and I don’t know why but when trippie said like gta we shoot at helicopters 🚁 I feel like that verse is lit especially when you got that miss the rage beat playing in the background 

5. Best hook in hip hop probably his and hers by don toliver 

But also I like the song by the late deceased rapper mo3 called outside that had a great hook you also got morray with trenches. You also got crocodile teeth by skiibeing what you need by don toliver lol theirs a decent amount but his and hers tops the list in my opinion just slighty



1. Best album cover is Pooh shiesty 
Shiesty season spring deluxe it look cool lol  maybe beam me up Scotty in second place 

2. Worst album any album I didn’t save in my plays list lol but I think my most disappointed album was khaled khaled he should of went harder with the connections he has and features he had on that album should of been a couple more bangers
And don’t get me started on lil tjays destined 2 win… that album was super disappointing especially comparing it to his first album 
4. I actually enjoyed khaled khaled somewhat lol most dragged it 

5. I think morrays album was decent underrated guy and artist to look forward to someone similar to rod wave"
50711,Do you have a sweet tooth? ^^[context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY)
50712,"Best albums: R.A.P. Ferreira - Bob's Son, Armand Hammer - Haram, Navy Blue - Navy's Reprise. [Here's](https://imgur.com/gallery/ArqtbU6) my overall top albums list for the year so far.

50713,"lol rym frog, respect"
50714,"My favorite album so far this year is Pray for Haiti. First Mach-Hommy album I’ve listened to and I loved it. I’m a big fan of Westside Gunn and Griselda in general so I knew I was going to like it at least somewhat going into it, but it still ended up blowing me away. West just has such a great ear for beats and knows how to curate that type of stuff so well. 

I also really enjoyed La Maquina from Conway. Great work from top to bottom. 200 Pies, Sister Abigail, Scatter Brain, Brusier Body and S.E. Gang were standouts to me. 

Other favorites of mine so far this year are The Plugs I Met 2, If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed, The Off Season, Tha Wolf on Wall St and To Kill a Sunrise.

Been enjoying the new Peter Rosenberg, Lloyd Banks and Smoke DZA lately. Excited to see what the rest of the year brings."
50715,"Best albums this year definitely coming out of Memphis in my opinion... Young Dolph + Key Glock, Duke Duece and Pooh Sheisty all dropped bangers. Stop sleepin!! 😤"
50716,"Albums:  
Fax Gang - Eathernet  
Armand Hammer & Alchemist - Haram  
Lil Yachty - Michigan Boy Boat  
Apathy - Where The River Meets The Sea  
Pooh Shiesty - Shiesty Season"
50717,"I can't really can't choose a greatest album but there were a couple good ones so far. 

Yelawolf went on an insane run early this year. 5 projects of which 4 were damn good. Especially Mudmouth and Mile Zero are still in heavy rotation for me. Funnily enough the worst album I've listened to this year was probably also in there (Turquoise Tornado). Just not my sound

Other artists with solid or very good albums were: slowthai, J. Cole, Nyck Caution, Kota the Friend, the Mello Music Group tape, DMX, Conway the Machine, Kenny Mason, Ghetts Brockhampton, Lloyd Banks, Smoke DZA

Lloyd Banks might become one of my favorites over time. Definitely a very good project on first listen"

50720,"fully agree with your best hooks, gang signs is so so good"

1. Gotham and Smiling With No Teeth

Fun ones,

5. But Gotham is being slept on for sure. Contender for Hip-Hop AOTY"

It doesn't feel like it's been a very eventful year in terms of new album drops really. The Off-Season was far and above my favorite. There was some good stuff on the AG Club, Paris Texas, Conway, and Moneybagg Yo albums as well but I don't think I've listened to them comprehensively enough to list them as a best album or not.

50746,"1. Haram, been big on Armand hammer for 2 years and this was just perfect for me. I like the fat ray album same with Mach Hommy even though I never really got into them before. Tony Allen’s album too I like a lot. 

2. As a beat album moderators Midnight Madness, as one rap beat I will probably pick Tony Allen deer in headlights.

3. Jid. Anytime he features I feel he brings a show. Also I gotta say I like when the bruiser brigade feature on each other’s songs they are always my favorite just the way they mesh with each other. 

4. Billy woods all over Haram. If I were to pick on probably Robert Moses or scaffolds

5. Middle men on dope game stupid. I know there are probably better ones but it gets stuck in my head a lot. 

Gotta say most slept on album is probably the Tony Allen one for me. I never see any discussions about it but the drum beats are my favorite shit and he’s got good rappers with good songs all over it. 

Shouts out Genesis Owusu, and Sons of Kemet they get a lot of plays from me too"
50747,"I know I need to branch out a little more and listen to some new artists,  but are people in this thread trying their hardest to not include the Off-Season?"
50748,I’ve listened to close to 110 albums this year. I liked it but it’s not in the top 25 honestly.
50749,Guess I need a bigger window.
50750,"You could very well still have it in your top list even if you listened to 1000 albums. 

Some of my favorite projects this year haven’t been very loved."
50751,"Not saying you’re bullshitting, but it’s crazy to me to think about. If we’re talking A L B U M S, in their E N T I R E T Y, I’ve maybe got 30 under my belt? Including all genres. Are you like a journalist or something?"
50752,"Nah I’ve listened to way more music this year than 2020+2019 combined. 

It really comes down to being bored. Last year was hectic because I worked in Supply a chain supporting Covid testing. Before last year I had an active social life. 

Now my work is slow and I have nothing going on until places fully open up."
50753,"I understand that but if my listening were to be of a similar volume I don’t think I’d absorb enough of each project to talk about ranking. This is all out of curiosity, clearly there is very different types of music consumption out there."
50754,How much time would you say you listen to new music per day?
50755,"Sorry for the late response. But clearly not enough to contribute to a discussion like this. I definitely stick to my comfort zone, every now-and-then finding something on a shuffle or taking up someone’s recommendation.

To the point: basically I’m not hunting for music. Kinda wish I did but I can be lazy/burnt out on my commutes and that’s where I listen the most."
50756,I get that. I went years without even listening to new music. But I don’t really enjoy watching tv and movies and I only play one video game so I have tons of free time and am hungry for new music.
50757,Certainly feels like it.
50758,"Fuck, the year *is* half over, isn't it?

I think it might be Praty for Haiti for me"
50759,"1. Off season. Bonus: SL2 and DR.EV4L

2. D.I.A.L. off of Topaz Jones' new album

3. Joshua Idehen on Field Negus

Next set of questions cuz eh

1. Easily Sons of Kemet - Black to the Future. The cover alone had me hyped.

2. I don't listen to bad albums lmao, if I don't like the first 3 tracks or so I don't listen to the rest

3. Either Genesis Owusu, Topaz Jones, or Anna Fox Rochinski

4. Not sure if these apply but Roadrunner, Sound Ancestors, and Demidevil

5. Either Bystander by Cool Sounds or Black to the Future by Sons of Kemet. I'll always shout out nu-jazz albums (the latter) and the former is one of the most pretty-sounding bluegrass albums I've ever heard. It literally feels like a warm sunny day."

Madlib - Sound Ancestors

It's hard for me to pick favorite beats for some reason. Partly that's because I know some of the best beats are probably deep cuts on albums I havent listened to as much. I also think the more mainstream trap beats have gotten kind of stale lately. Beatwise I'm much more interested in whats coming from people like Alchemist and L'Orange and August Fannon. Still hard for me to pick favorite tracks though.

Favorite artist I've ""discovered"" this year has probably been Pink Siifu. I've been aware of him for a while but his music hasn't clicked with me till recently. Been playing Ensley more and Negro a couple times, although that one is not an easy listen. 

As for albums I've liked that other people haven't - maybe Jim Jones, I liked Th1rt33n (Pharaoh Monche) not sure how people like that, and I kinda liked the Kevin Gates mixtape. 

I need to listen to that Mach Hommy shit more, it probably belongs on this list."
50774,"You should check out B. Cool-Aid if you haven’t yet, it’s a duo of Pink Siifu over production by Ahwlee. Their ep Syrup is a really smooth listen. 

Favorite project by August Fannon? I just found him the other day on Bandcamp and enjoyed his Nas tape"
50775,"Honestly haven't checked a whole project yet, I was listening to Dad Bod Rap Pod interview Armand Hammer and they were talking about how he sent them several tapes worth of beats to rap over and also that he had a bunch of themed beat tapes that will probably never be released. I like everything he's produced for them, but I need to check out more. Nas tape sounds like a good place to start"

50778,Which Crimeapple project is your favorite so far? It’s a toss up between Wet Dirt and Aguardiente for me.
50779,Mines probably Aguardiente. Big Ghost is just really consistent on it and Crimeapple shines throughout.
50780,"Yea I think Aguardiente and Van Ghost, both released in 2018 are the best Big Ghost projects. Those beats are just hard"
50781,"Not hip hop but surface sounds by kaleo is my aoty so far. Rock and indie, I’d check it out if you’re looking to diversify"
50782,"gonna update with the other answers late but     
my full list of my top projects of the year   

https://i.imgur.com/ZkPSaMM.png

for those too lazy to click the top 5 are     
1. Sonder - TOO LATE TO DIE YOUNG     
2. Savon - AZURE   
3. Mustafa - When Smoke Rises   
4. Brent Faiyaz - DO NOT LISTEN EP     
5. MadeinTYO - Never Forgotten [SOUL-LUXE]      
can’t recommend listening to these enough (as well as V TAPE by vic mensa and iv by sam gellaitry). some amazing shit on there      

my top 40 songs of the year list

best cover (and title): [nascent - minus the bullshit, life’s great](https://images.genius.com/b29fe73f002ede824282daf629104abd.1000x1000x1.jpg)     
    
worst album: the valee one      
most slept on album: my top 5"
50783,"Did Sonder even drop a project? doesnt show up on their spotify.

Mad respect for the mustafa big up. You're the only person here that mentioned it and it's easily the best project this year for me. Also shoutouts Savon."
50784,"yeah the sonder ep (if it’s even one) [was only released here](https://youtu.be/O2OLg3AuUag) on yt as a 13 minute video, same case w the brent ep. for what it’s worth the visuals are really dope
and haha it’s cool to see someone else know savon, dude is super nice and his music is great, i’m always trynna show love to him.     
     
and yeah that mustafa project is amazing, it’s weird seeing it not get love or attention here considering it has sampha/james blake/jamie xx credits"
50785,How did you make that chart?
50786,[here](https://www.neverendingchartrendering.org/)
50787,"Basic:
1. Best album for me is Flu Game by AJ Tracey. Very good flow from him, really good beats, and whole project is very consistent
2. Best beats must be Lay With Ya from Rashad(this beat is insane) and What You Need from Don also Calling My Phone from Lil Tjay
3. Best features are from Offset on Shoot my Shoot from IDK and Run It Up from Lil Tjay
4. This is hard to decide for me
5. Definetly What You Need and His & Hers from Don. His voice is insane 

Fun ones:
1. Best cover arts are from iivrson(i love this roses theme, looking clean) and Sleepy Hallow(good design, and colours)
2. Dj Khaled album is worst album of this year so far, generic af beats, it has so much good names but Khaled can’t use it for good. But i gotta admit i love Popstar with Drake. The rest of the songs are boring 
3. It must be $avvy. He made album in this year „Boys Wears Pearls” and he create so much catchy music. It is shocking for me he only have 700 listeners this month. If you like melodic rap i reccomend to check his last album
4. 24kgldn. He creates very catchy songs, very easy listen for me, chill vibes. I like how he mix rap with pop
5. Flu Game from AJ Tracey. It has a lot of good, high energy songs, melodic songs. It has good production, feats, and Tracey is really a solid rapper"
50788,"Best album so far for me is a tie with:

Armand Hammer & The Alchemist - Haram- Two powerhouse lyricists spitting powerful bars over sublime beats from The Alchemist (that album art... wow).

Czarface and MF DOOM- Super What?- Three dominant MCs bring their A-game alongside  amazing production by 7L. The playfulness of the comic book theme combined with Eso's powerful performance and DOOM's high lyrical content level result in a fantastic album. Though the final track pulls the project down as a whole."
50789,"I'm a big fan of Czar and the project felt very rushed together to me. Particularly, I thought the production was just OK in comparison compared to the last one they did along with the overall chemistry.

Deck was a weak point for me, and I like Eso but he doesn't do enough for me to carry a track himself most of the time. I think the bar set by their past work is what gets me though. It's not bad, I just have little desire to replay it when I feel their 2013-2018 stuff does the zany comic book rap style better for me."
50790,Hey I actually just listened to superwhat? And thought it was dope so if you think their older stuff is better which would you recommend
50791,"Edit: reposting because my original cut off.

My taste varies a little bit with the popular consensus but I am the creator of /r/Czarface so I'm not just a casual fan at least lol.

Definitely check out the last album with DOOM, I think they all brought it including Deck and the production nails the comic book/sci-fi niche. It all sounds ""Volcanic"" for lack of a better word but looking at the album cover it's a good match I think. (Songs: Forever People, Nautical Depth, Stun Gun, Captain Brunch)

After that my favorite Czarface project is their debut; it has great variety in the instruments used for the production. The opening tracks have kind of an X-Men cartoon feel with heavy drums and droning synth bass. The features all kill it, it's hard to describe the sound of this album overall because it kind of shifts towards funkier, live band stuff with guitar and 60's orchestra samples. The features all have solid verses with my favorite being Madlib's Brother Oh No on ""Czar Rafaeli"". Deck and Eso are less polished but their raw chemistry is undeniable. (Songs: Air Em Out, Cement 3's, Hazmat Rap, It's Raw)

However, many people think the best Czar project is Every Hero Needs a Villain. This album has great features and a cohesive, retro-rock sound to it with lots of neat guitar riffs and kick ass drums. I feel that the album is too same-y and hard to listen to the whole way through repeatedly, but it's definitely one of their better projects (It has a song with DOOM too, Ka-Bang, and its solid)

(Songs: Czartacus, Junkyard Dogs, Escape From Czarkham Asylum, Sinister)

Their other projects are ok but inconsistent and the only essential listening I would say is Fistful of Peril, that's just ok"
50792,"Yeah man, I definitely get where you’re coming from. Coming off their great 2018 release combined with post humorous DOOM verses I was beyond psyched for this album.

Oh my first few listens it did seem a bit anemic and rushed, especially with DOOM’s verses kinda  haphazardly tossed in places. But the album really grew on me with repeat listens.

Also, I do agree Deck was definitely second to Eso’s devastating flow but he brought a milder energy that allowed Eso to shine I think. Also off tracks like “Canon” he still put up a good performance."
50793,Duke Duece wins in all categories.
50794,"Some of my favorite albums this year are

* Tru Carr - Based On A TRU Story
* ALLBLACK - TY4FWM
* Drakeo The Ruler - The Truth Hurts
* The Alchemist - This Thing of Ours
* Shelly FKA DRAM - Self Titled

Favorite verse is Boldy James on TV Dinners

> Blew a fifty on a Dwele, with girly out in LA

> Tryna stick me, gotta get up earlier than Thebe

> Goyard skully, gazin' at the stars in the Culli'

> It's still Hell Block hully-gully

> Gift wrap them brickies then we kidnap them slippies

> Forties on deck like a six-pack of mickeys

> Name heavy in the street as a rose gold Phillipe

> Came fully AP'd, now I need a Richie

> Wasn't takin' 'til I hit it with the G-rizzy

> Watched it come together, full circle, did a 360

> Cut it with the lactose and get a free fifty

> Reekin' of second-hand crack smoke and cheap whiskey

> Ghost Glock on my waist, made a killin' off the noise

> Block so hot, got the paint peelin' off the walls

> Quarter, half brick, whole brick, I can move it all

> Auntie want it quick, gettin' sick, goin' through withdrawals

> Where we at?

Something about Boldy's delivery that I love. Last year he became my favorite member on Griselda and I guess it's going to keep continuing to be that way.

Edit: I lied. My favorite verse is Jay on 'What It Feels Like' 

> Scorpion bricks, way before Aubrey's double disc

> .40 on my lap, clap, sound like 40 did the mix

And 

> You let them crackers storm your Capitol, put they feet up on your desk

> And yet you talkin' tough to me, I lost all my little respect

---

Most disappointing albums this year?

Benny the Butcher & Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2. 

On paper it should be a classic, but it's forgettable for me. I've only gone back to it twice. Don't know why it didn't stick for me."
50795,Yea I enjoyed the Benny album but I haven’t listened to it since. I keep on going back to the Dark Lo tape though. I think that is the better Fraud release of 2021.
50796,"Some of my favourites so far:

• CZARFACE & MF DOOM - Super What?

• L’Orange & Namir Blade - Imaginary Everything 

• KAAN -Kaizen

• Prince Shakur - The Kids Turned Out Fine

Edit

Non hip hop but El Michels Affair - Yeti Season"
50797,I forgot about that Prince Shakur album. That one was pretty good.
50798,"I will keep it simple and mention albums that are some of the best and underrated aswell

1. Jim Jones & Harry Fraud - The Fraud Department
2. Benny The Butcher & Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2
3. Dave East & Millyz - Pablo & Blanco

These are fairly new but so far great

1. Lloyd Banks - Coti
2. DMX - Exodus

One of the best singles this year is without a doubt

Jay-Z & Nipsey Hussle - What It Feels Like"
50799,"I love everything Jim Jones touches these days. He can’t miss.

Love Dave East, too. Listening since maybe ‘13-14. Straight Outta Harlem and all that good stuff. I think he came out with a dud with this one though. Maybe I should re-listen. I’ve gone through it twice now."
50800,"Dave East
Jim Jones
Fabolous
Griselda
Styles P

Are in my opinion the most consistent rappers the last couple of years (and I am not even from New York but Europe)"
50801,"Man me and you would get along. 

Fab is top 5 for me DOA. Jim Jones second chapter of his career has been better than his first, kinda like Boosie after prison. 

Styles P has done a good job too with his newer music.

Dave East has made excellent projects almost 8 years straight. Still kinda crazy to me he isn’t more famous. But that’s how it goes."
50802,"Dave East is so underrated, he should be as big as someone like Meek Mill

Fab is the punchline king, and has a lot of witty lyrics about topics like loyalty ect. Can't wait for him to drop some new shit"
50803,"That’s a good comparison on levels of fame. I liked Meek A LOT more earlier on. Radio show freestyles after being up for 2-3 days straight. Fun to hear them. Dreams Worth More Than Money was the last CD of his I purchased. Kinda fell off after that.

Dave East still has plenty of time to make good and become more relevant. Sometimes fame is a curse though. I loved Kevin Gates, then he came out with his first commercial album and his sound went south (not geographically)."
50804,"Jim and Benny are also in my top 3 this year so far. The Fraud Department just feels so smooth all the way through. From Jones' rapping and Frauds prod, just a real standout project"
50805,"I hope they will make a part 2

My favorites are
Fucked up
Aunt viola
Make it home

Had those 3 on repeat for a while"
50806,"I'm ngl, Bada Bing is such a bop. Jones' verse on that is so braggadocious, I love it. Barry White and Lose Lose are probably my favourites, his flows on there are crazy. Agree though on them making a part 2 or a whole other album. I'm here for more Jones and Fraud"
50807,"So glad Jim and french squashed the beef, otherwise this project wouldn't be possible, Barry white is also one of my fav, and they made a dope video to it aswell"
50808,"Just gonna do a couple for now

50809,"not nearly enough respect for Paris Texas on this subreddit.

listen to mustafa"
50810,That Viagra Boys record is so dope
50811,I couldn't get into Bruiser Wolf but the Fat Ray album is flames
50812,How did you feel the R.A.P. Ferreira album compared to his release last year? I see a lot of people mentioned they didn’t like it nearly as much.
50813,"Definitely prefer the last one but I really fuck with this one on repeated listens, sorta how I got into budding anthropologists"
50814,What’s your favorite Detroit album this year? I know you’re into that but I don’t know the artists enough to know if any are on your list.
50815,"Babyface Ray - *Unfuckwitable* is pretty good but not best of the year good.

My favorite Detroit tapes are Vezzo's and Molly Brazy's (honestly haven't gotten around to Dugg but I bet that one's good)

I'm waiting on Sada or Lonnie they always deliver"
50816,"yooo gami gang under not hip-hop, those guys are absolute saints! spirit of the beehive is crazy good too"
50817,"I've been so obsessed w that album (and their last one before that)

The transitions are so great, the hooks are catchy as hell.

Bossa Nova Corps -> Kno U is crazy (no pun intended)

I also love the ""motherfucking gami gang"" at the start of ""Isopropyl Alchemy"" and the *Jimmy Newtron* sample I forget which song. It's a really good synthesis of pop punk sensibilities and math rock/metal intricate guitar work."
50818,"i've been following them since their first release, their growth has been truly astounding, i can only begin to imagine where they'll keep going since these albums were written around the same time period. 



Bossa Nova and Self Destruct are my favorite things they've done yet, i think they're gonna be major players in pushing punk music forward and renewing wider interest in it with that level of chemistry and songwriting"
50820,"I agree with these, and would also add:

Black up - Shabazz Palaces 

Cold Vein - Cannibal Ox"
50821,The production on Black Up gives me chills every time
50823,"You're welcome fam (:',"
50824,upvote for Clipping
50825,"Great albums here

Although I have never ever heard of Clipping"
50826,Hell yeah dude! Clipping is awesome. I'm not much of a hip hop producer but the ways they utilize Foley is always super creative and inspiring.
50827,"I've heard and love everything on this list except Madvillainy. Guess I better come out from under this rock, finally."
50828,"Mos Def & Talib Kweli are Black Star 

Illmatic

The Low End Theory 

Honestly the new Tribe is creeping up there, it was easily my AOTY but I'm still listening to at least half the tracks every day. It's a fucking fascinating album to me."
50829,"Out of curiosity, what do you find fascinating about it?"
50830,I like how they make the classic sound come off as fresh again with modern techniques here and there.
50831,"I mean besides the out of this world production and cooler-every-time lyrics: 

1. This is just how I listen to music but I'll listen to an album, then if the albums good I'll usually have like single songs I'll play in the future. If it's a particularly great album I'll usually have one, what me and my friends call, ""power trio"", just the three songs that are sickest and also work well together. Examples

- 3001 A Laced Odyssey: Bounce, RIPCD, A Spike Lee Joint 

- Piñata: Thuggin' , Shitsville, Real

- Acid Rap: Favorite Song, NaNa, Smoke Again

This just all subjective of course. What's interesting for me is that this album has none of those. I can pick any three songs and it's a power trio. Weakest would probably be Melatonin->Mobius, but even that is better songwriting than half of what I heard this past year. 

2. Jarobi. What this mans been doing? His verse on The Space Program forcibly made me dance, and that's only the first verse of the album. He kills is in every verse and fucking ""rides"" the beat like no other. Def want to hear more of him + Q Tip. 

3. I'm a huge Tribe fan and The Low End Theory is my favorite album ever so all this is fangirling on my part."
50832,"That's fair, and I really appreciate the explanation.

I'm intrigued by this idea that a great album has/ should have three great songs. I'll have to keep an ear out for that. Do you have any playlists where you have compiled the ""power trios"" of various albums?

Did you feel this strongly about the album on first listen? I personally find that many of my all time favourite albums have taken many play-throughs to work their way into my head and heart (this album included).

Are there any other records (other than TLET) that you feel are at this level?"
50833,I would feel comfortable saying it was my AOTY too. I don't understand why people weren't freaking out over it. It's seriously like a 9/10 or higher IMO.
50834,Doris is mine by a long shot tbh
50835,"And for me its Idlsidgo. Easily.



Fucking love Doris though."
50836,Fuck I'm keen to see what he's gonna put out next.
50837,"""What is your favorite rap album"" and ""what is the best rap album ever made"" are two entirely different questions. 

That being said, Wu-Tang Forever."
50838,"No particular order,

Lupe Fiasco - The Cool/ F&L2

Kanye - MBDTF

Jay Electronica - Bright Spots 2.0

Wu Tang - 36 Chambers

Eminem - SSLP

More recently,

Lupe - Pharoah Heights/ T&Y

Your Old Droog - Kinson EP

Isaiah Rashad - The Sun's Tirade

Freddie Gibbs - Shadow of a doubt

Mick Jenkins - The Water[s]"
50839,"I'm curious, why do you prefer F&L2 over the original?"
50840,SSLP over MMLP?
50841,Interchangeable in my opinion. Just had Rock Bottom come on earlier today and it reminded me how much I really loved old Slim.
50842,Rock Bottom is probably my favorite Em track tbh
50843,classic raw realness
50844,TES is my personal favorite.
50845,Em as a whole from Infinite to TES is top 3/GOAT material.
50846,He the GOAT to me
50847,"Interesting that you mention Freddie Gibbs - Shadow of a Doubt.

Im a BIG Gibbs fan, but i still cant get completely into that album. I fuck more with ESGN and Pinata"
50848,"Fuckin up the count, my boy, Mexico, packages, and Forever and a day. Love Madlib+Freddie and I can't wait Bandana but I was scared Shadow was going to be our last Gibbs project for a loooong time."
50849,"> Love Madlib+Freddie and I can't wait Bandan

Well, Gibbs hasnt been active for a while on social media or anything.
So it might take a while for Bandana to release, who knows ?

The few tracks thats been released after he came out of jail has been recorded before (im pretty sure about this) and was released by other artists like Harry Fraud for their tape."
50850,instantly +1 when i saw the waters
50851,"High hopes for Mick, not the biggest fan of THC, but Trees and Truths,  Waters and Waves still get daily spins"
50852,"Damn I fucking love THC, it's to psych rock what TPAB was to jazz. It's subject matter was pretty corny but the instrumentals were absolutely nuts and Micks bars are always dope."
50853,Quasimoto The Unseen
50854,"Kanye- MBDTW
Kendrick- TPAB
J Cole - '14 FHD
Drake - Take Care
Nas and Damien - Distant relatives (super underrated)

50857,Enta da stage needs more recognition as a classic.
50858,Yes indeed!
50859,Black Moon and most of Nervous records is slept on.
50860,Will sessions crushed elmatic
50861,Liquid Swords but maybe to pimp a butterfly time will tell for that
50863,93til infinity-souls of mischief

50865,"Some of my favourite:

Wu-Tang Clan - 36 Chambers

Madvillain - Madvillainy

Mos Deff - Black on Both Sides

And some albums from my country that you have probably never heard of haha"
50866,My favourites are Kanye - MBDTF and Kendrick - GKMC.
50867,Illmatic and Resurrection by nas and common are definitely some ground breaking albums
50868,i love resurrection but its probably not even one of his top 2 albums lol Finding Forever and Be are total classics imo
50869,CZARFACE (self titled album from 2013)
50870,"36 chambers. every single track is an absolute banger, zero filler whatsoever. I think illmatic is a very close second"
50872,My only 10/10s are Snoop's Doggystyle and Dre's 2001
50873,2001 - dr dre and TPAB by kendrick are 2 of my favorites.
