11654,A new bicycle. He rides it to work every day he can!
11655,"A comfortable place to stay for all eternity.

It's ok, he ""urned"" it."
67315,Nice
11657,This guy cremates
11658,"My dad always wears slippers around the house. When I was ten, and doing pottery in art class at school, I got the strange idea to make him a clay slipper with a rocket on the back and wings on the side. As far as I can recall, there is no interesting or touching story associated with it. My dad is pretty no-nonsense, he doesn't have a weird or ironic sense of humour or anything, but that slipper still sits on the mantle, 20 years later. I think it's just been there for so long it's never occurred to him to take it down."
11659,"My dad, for years, had mentioned wanting to go kayaking, just around a lake or something. I found a place that does rentals on a nearby river (really, calm, no rapids at all) and paid for a 15 mile/5 hour kayak float trip. It was super cool, but going out on the water on a mid-June afternoon kinda sucked. My parents liked it so much they went and bought a set of kayaks and go out kayak fishing pretty much every weekend now."
11660,"My dad wore his annual Father's Day shirts until they were transparent. When he passed, I found them all in a box in his closet. He never threw one out."
11661,"His coffin. I gave it to him last Father's Day so he wouldn't have to worry about my moms finances. I'm still paying it off. 

Edit: Yes, my dad passed away. Last June on my husbands birthday."
11662,Dark but thoughtful.
11663,"For a second I thought you were going to say he passed away. I'm glad he's still kicking, and it sounds like you are very thoughtful! This is a really nice gift. 

My parents are nowhere near old enough to be planning for their ends, but I sometimes think about starting to anyway. I know it's morbid to think about it,  but my parents were high school sweethearts, got married at 18, waited 16 years to have kids, and have been married for over 35 years now. I can honestly say that I know they love each other because of the small things they still do for each other all the time. They still hold hands sometimes just walking around the grocery store for goodness sake. 

 I just know that when one of them passes, the remaining one will just be destroyed emotionally. I am so sad thinking about it, but planning their funerals would probably make it easier on all of us. 

How did you go about giving him a coffin? Like, how did you tell your dad you were doing that without him getting offended? Obviously the intentions are good, but I'm  worried he thinks I'll be calling him old or that I'm anticipating his death."
11664,"I made him a belt when I was 7 or 8 and my mom put me in leather craft. I had this star shaped punch and used it to spell out ""daddy"" which is weird cause I swear I only ever called him ""dad"". Except I was your typical 7 year old and ran out of room, so it looks like:

**

*****

*          *

*           *

*        *

*****

Fuck I can't handle this ascii art I'm too dunk.

Look I ran out of room so the Y is like rediculously thin since i ran out of room.

It's also an ugly tan colour.

It's also back wards (like for a lefty)

Anyways he still wears the damn thing like 30 years later, and it makes me happy whenever I see it

But over the years I've had more than one friend ask if my dad is some sort of pimp since he wears a daddy belt...

Love you dad, you're my hero!"
11665,"I bought my dad a wooden battery box when I was 10 or 11 at a dollar store. He kept it stacked until he died, always able to power up birthday and Christmas presents for us kids and then grandkids. Now I keep it stocked, although most the kids toys come with built in batteries now. I always have fresh batteries for the remotes and fire detectors though."
11666,"When I was really little, I gave my dad a coin that says ""World's #1 Dad"" on it. He keeps it in his wallet and never takes it out unless he's showing it off. There's a permanent ring in the leather now."
11667,"Nose hair trimmers. 

My dad usually says gifts are a waste of money and that people should get useful things instead.

He uses that sucker every Sunday night. My brother's been trying to top it ever since."
11670,"Does it say ""Bad Mother Fucker"" on it?"
11671,Looks like you have a gift idea for this year!
11672,nice subtle way of saying: as you get older.. look who's gonna help take care of your money. huh?  uhuhh?
11673,"From the other side, I got this paperweight from my son when he was two. He's graduating Saturday. http://i.imgur.com/3H4WGpB.jpg"
11674,"Nice. I'm similar. My kids gave me an Opel Brand keychain when they were little. People ask me why I have an Opel Keychain all the time.

All I can tell them is: ""My kids gave me this"" and then if they don't understand screw them.

btw, I've never owned an Opel."
11675,"First off, I am a 34 year old man. When I was in jr high school, I took both shop class, and home ec. For home ec one time, we sewed together sweatshirts with a design of our choosing, from whatever type of catalog we were using at the time. I picked out a pattern that had a design of a cheetah, hanging from a tree limb, and there's a quote that says ""just hangin' around"" on it. I gave it to my father for father's day like, 22 years ago, and I'll still go to his house and see him wearing this fucking old ass ""just hangin' around"" sweatshirt. Cracks me up inside every time I see it."
11676,I get him fake flowers. He likes them. He died in 2008. Dead people fucking love that shit.
11677,"It was kind of a second hand gift I guess. I bought myself a red and white yeti cooler. Not the biggest one, but it was a bigger sized one. I got tired of lugging the big bastard around so I gave it to my dad on Father's Day. He loves it and has used it just about every weekend for the past 3 or 4 years. Also he's a huge Alabama fan so the color of the cooler goes well with his fandom."
11678,"When I was little, my mother bought this small wooden statue of a ship's captain so my brother and I could give it to him (Dad was in the Navy). He still has it, some 20 odd years later, even though the paint is chipped and faded and we've been through several moves."
11679,"My father is dead.  He was a fantastic mechanic, and I bought him tools."
11680,I'm sorry for your loss :( What was he like?
11681,"He was a great dad.  Very practical, taught me you could pretty much do anything if you had the right tools.  And he did just about everything.  Taught me the whole time, essentially taught me to be fearless. We played sports, watched sports...  Even my sister, who is a total girly-girl, refinished her outbuilding by hand, thanks to my father's teachings.  He died of an MI, but also had stage 4 colon cancer.  That is a very silent killer.  We had no idea until it actually perforated his intestines. Take care of yourselves, people."
11682,"When I was arou d 8 or 9, I made this crappy little centaur out of scrap wood for my dad. Painted it to look like him as best a kid that age could. Its still in his office to this day, I'm now 23 almost 24. He uses it to hold his safety glasses. Kind of makes me tear up."
11683,hatred towards me
11684,"Depends what you mean by use. 

He got cremated with a pillow I made him. 

Bitch, that took hours to make! You could've given it back."
11685,"Ties, gets a ties every year and always wears that same tie until he gets a new one as a gift."
11686,I usually try to get my dad a fanny pack every year. Classic Dad.
11687,"Got dad a stag handle, folded steel knife. For cheap Pakistani steel, it took a hell of a blade. That thing has remained razor sharp, and it's his go-to work knife. I think it was only like $30, we made a better sheath for it. 

Worked out so well that I bought myself a fixed blade one, great work knife"
11688,Do you have a link to the knife itself or somewhere I can buy it? That sounds like a steal and something I'll use.
11689,"Zippo, Knife, and a flashlight. 

these are the only things I get him really, and hes always happy, that man cannot have enough flashlights"
11690,An ipod nano. I don't know how it has lasted so long.
11691,"Gerber multi tool. Bought him the first one when I turned 16 and got my first job. He's had it on his hip ever since. He broke the 1st one, mom made him keep using it until the next gift holiday so I could replace it. That's been the drill ever since. They seem to last him about 5 years. Gave him his 3rd one at Xmas this year.

Edit: this is the one from Xmas 2016 http://www.gerbergear.com/Multi-Tools/One-Hand-Opening/MP400_45500"
11692,Shoe polishing kit.
11693,A full set of screwdrivers in a nice little carrying bag. That man protects that little bag of tools with his life and carries it with him frigging everywhere. It makes me happy that I gave him something that he could have bought for himself anytime but never thought to.
11694,"I once made my father a mouspad in elementary school. Now of course by ""made"" I mean our teacher spoon fed us step by step directions of how to apply a plastic layer to the padding. However, we got to put a drawing between the plastic and the padding so I made some crude drawing of my dad as a super hero called super dad (creative genuis, I know. RIP my theater degree sorry dad) and while it used to be his work mouse pad, it now resides in our den for my parents computer. Now he's not super tech savvy so he doesn't use the computer a lot but my mom gets a lot of use from it, so if say it turned out okay. 

Sorry for grammar and probably spelling"
11695,A walking stick from Germany.
11696,"A ""Worlds Best Mom"" coffee mug."
11697,He hung the painting I made for him.
11698,I'll get him something this year to show the amount of care he's put into being a part of my life: absolutely nothing. I'm glad people have good dads to celebrate on Father's Day but mine's a piece of shit who chose my step mom and her kids over my brother and me. I thought I was making things right with my relationship with him after not being in contact much for a long time. Then he refused to show up to my wedding. Done.
11699,"A pen/pencil holder I made in second grade. It was a frozen orange juice can with lots of tissue paper applied on it. Over the years, the colors all faded out, but he kept it on his dresser and used it. He died last May and it's still on his dresser."
11700,I looked at for a map
11701,His ability to celebrate fathers day.
11702,"Aviator sunglasses. Every Memorial Day I come back home and there he is, sitting on the lawn in his sunglasses."
11703,Disappointment
11704,Me and my sister have him a card when we were 5 years old and sometimes I catch him looking through the drawings we made for him :)
11705,A grill set that is golf themed.
11706,A bunch of love.
11707,A T-shirt that I got free with a case of beer. He's been rocking it regularly for years now
11708,A tie...Every year he gets a tie...
11709,A cordless power tool combo kit. He loves those things. This was maybe 10 years ago? He still uses them and always calls/texts to tell me when he does.
11710,"Those cheesy Father's Day shirts (""the dad, the myth, the legend,"" and the like) people usually buy as a joke.  My dad loves them and wears them all the time."
11711,"I made my dad a toolbox when I was in junior high. He wasn't a construction man by any means but it was a school project we did. Either that or a birdhouse.

Fast forward 9 years and he started using it when building a new deck at our house! Kinda cool feeling to see it brought back out from the depths of my childhood."
11712,"HBO and Netflix subscriptions. We share them so I don't mind paying for it each month, but his mind is still blown by how cool streaming services are."
11713,"Well, there was that casket...."
11714,"Ring holder by his computer keyboard. He lost about 4 wedding bands because he likes to take it off while typing (fingers swell, metal clicks against the keys), and mom was really getting frustrated that they just kept disappearing. Got him a simple little stone bowl that he leaves it in and problem solved. $15 solution to otherwise expensive problem."
11715,"Gift cards (the ones like credit cards), because I never know what to get. He combined a couple of them from Father's Day and his birthday one year and got his first smoker, wood for it and some accessories. He did pay some out of pocket, but it helped with the initial outlay. He still uses that smoker too, unless he wants to go grill style rather than cabinet."
11716,Zip ties! Got a huge pack for him 10 years ago. Still see things around my parents house jerry rigged with them
11717,A small toy pig for his car. I gave it to him when I was 8. I'm 21 now and he still keeps it on his dashboard.
11718,"That was a giftcard, and I wrote: You’re the best, Dad. I love you!"
11719,Air compressor...he loves it.
11720,"Every year for Father's Day (or the weekend before/after depending on if I am out of town for work), I will take my dad golfing or on a camping/fishing trip just by ourselves.  I feel like it's a lot better than giving him ""stuff"".  Making memories with him is huge for me, even though he's only in his 40's.  Seeing a lot of folks on here whom have lost their fathers makes me really want to enjoy our time together. Anything can happen at any time, and that scares the shit out of me."
11721,"For about six years (since my grandparents got married), my brother and I have given him a flashlight each holiday. I have no clue how it started or even why, but we've kept it going. He has a huge shelf above their fireplace that he custom-built for all of them and he brags about them every chance he gets. It's adorable, honestly."
11722,I get my dad little knick-knacks. He keeps them in his top drawer.
11723,"I always made my dad little things every year, and when he died I found them all in a box in his nightstand. It was awesome to know that he kept them all."
11724,"My oldest is now 20. He's given me one of his GI Joe figures, a Lego stormtrooper, a Hot Wheels and a 5 pack of gum. They're all in a little wooden chest. I don't think he knows."
11725,"A Chromebook. My dad is a babyboomer who has had a decent life, but never got into technology. I bought him a Chromebook three years ago and he uses it daily to assist in the tasks he does. His browser favorites are all farming, cattle, and trading sites like Craigslist, but he is making great use out of it.  This year I plan to introduce the concept of smartphones."
11727,Is this still a good gift when the daughter is 19? That would save me some money
11728,"Write down the best day with your dad or the best thing he taught you. Put it with a picture of you and him. Doesn't cost much or anything if you have the paper and picture, but it's priceless if you're a parent."
11729,...and put the letter and the picture under a rock.
11730,"Better yet, wrap it round the rock and throw it through the window."
11731,That's cute as shit. How long ago was that?
11732,Last year on Father's Day.
11733,"My wife asked me why I carry my gun in the house. I replied ""Decepticons."" She laughed, I laughed, the toaster laughed, I shot the toaster."
11734,This morning
11735,"'Jesus Christ Marie, They're minerals!'"
11736,"That's adorable. I'm picturing her being 35 now, coming home to visit her parents and seeing that damn rock on the mantle."
11738,Did the cone spiders hatch from it yet?
11739,"My cousin also gave me a pinecone that he painted pink and green (my favorite colors) and put googly eyes on it. It's lost an eye, but that thing goes with me everywhere I move to."
11740,"My old man has never seemed disappointed by a slightly above average bottle of booze. He shakes the box every time. ""Yep sounds about right!"""
11741,I would be very happy if my wife got me a $45 bottle of bourbon :)
11742,"Let's have lunch.  I would rather spend a bit of time with my kids than get a gift.

Edit:  Thanks so much for the gold.  Happy Father's Day!"
11743,"So very much this.  I only get to see my son a few times a month.  I have him on Father's Day this year and could not be more thrilled.  Even if all we do is sit and play video games and eat reheated pizza, it would be the best Father's Day ever."
11744,"Reheated pizza? Hell no, eat it cold."
11745,"Eat it cold? Hell no, toast that shit up on the cast iron skillet."
11746,Eating cast iron skillet reheated pizza right now
11747,"Somewhat related, I'm inheriting my father set of cast iron skillets when he dies. He has had a full set over 30 years. I might be looking forward to it, just slightly."
11748,"i was sharing this with a co-worker the other day that this is the one good thing that would come out of my fathers passing... i will miss him dearly, i will want him to be in my life, but i get his set of cast iron pans, seasoned for pushing 80 years now, in perfect condition.... 

but at the cost of my father... :("
11749,"Love my dad, but yeah I'd get the pans and the guns. I'm looking forward to the pans most of all.

Hope he lives long, but soon as he passes I'm grabbing those pans."
11750,"Can confirm, this is how I always heat up Pizza: http://imgur.com/gallery/Gvzp5yA"
11751,"Can confirm, it is how he always heats up pizza"
11752,Plane ticket to see my father is more than $50 sorry
11753,Skype lunch date
11754,I would rather fly to him then try to teach him how to use a computer
11755,"You're right, teaching him how to use a computer would be much easier to do in person. You should definitely fly to him first, and *then* teach him.

(You should have said ""than"")"
11756,That's a graduate-level Dad Joke right there.
11757,"My kids are adults now, and my favorite fathers day was going to see a movie together and then dinner."
11758,"Spend money on experiences, not things. I love it. Happy Father's Day, dude!"
11759,This guy is the rightest. I either take my dad to see a movie or go fishing or something. I can tell he appreciates it more than some lame gift. Its raining this weekend so I'm going to take a day off next week and rent kayaks and go fishing.
11761,"I'm giving my dad $49.99, guess I just love him a little more than some people"
11762,Im giving it to him in pennies so he'll have fun counting it too!
11763,I'll throw in one dime just for extra fun!!
11764,"*Dad sits down at the kitchen table and dumps out his bag of coins.*
""Lets see how much the little bastard got me this year. $0.01, $0.02, $0.03... $31.34, $31.35. Wha, what's this? A dime!? What the hell? Wait! Where was I?!? KYYLLE!"""
11765,God dammit Kyle.
11767,I am your father.
11768,That explains his face
11769,"I sent my dad a bag of candy penises. On the card I wrote ""what do you get for the man who has everything? Does he have a bag of dicks? Likely not. Well, he does now. Happy father's day!"""
11770,"Dear Dad,

Eat a bag of dicks."
11771,"Roses are red.

Violets are blue.

Eat a bag of dicks, Dad. 

I love you."
11772,"Pronounce Dad right, and you can even get a second rhyme in there"
11773,Roses are rad! Cowabunga!
11774,Where does one go about acquiring said candy penises?
11775,"I think the company that makes them is called Big Black Cock, try a google image search.  If not I got a sweet deal on a bag of candy penises at hairybears.com.  (it was a few years ago, I am not sure if they still sell them.)"
11776,"Oh ho ho, you won't get me like that again!"
11777,Fool me once shame on you. Fool me 17 times and I may have developed a fetish
11778,[ candy penises](http://dicksbymail.com/) This is now in my browsing history. You're welcome
11779,Sex shops always have a bunch of funny penis-shaped items for bachelorette parties
11780,Disappointment is free.
11781,I get my dad that every year!
11782,Guess who's still not married!
11783,You don't have to be married to be a father.
11784,But you do have to have sex.
11785,"This reminds me of when my mom wanted to know what we would have for dinner mother's day.

She asked ""What are you making me for mother's day?""

I replied ""Disappointed.""

And then I laughed."
11786,But he gets that everyday. It's a special occasion!
11787,So gift-wrap it.
11788,"Well my dad used to have an NES when the first came out. Him and I used to play it all the time until it broke.  My mom ended up throwing it away.  This last Monday I walked in a game store and found one with new internal parts that works.  I grabbed it, an extra controller, and a mario cartridge. I'm gonna have them set up to go for when he wakes up the day after Father's Day (which is actually his birthday)."
11789,It's my birthday too! Can we pretend you have 2 dads on that day?
11790,"Honestly, just a card and a quiet day for me is fine. No need to spend a lot of money."
11791,"Ok, thanks dad"
11792,"No problem. Cheesy, I know but it's honest. No if you *want* to spend money then a new Harley will do."
11793,My dad has been hinting about a Ferrari he's always wanted. I've been buying him the Hot Wheels version every year for Father's Day.
11794,Are you a bear?
11795,(￣(ｴ)￣)ﾉ Yep.
11797,I'm not entirely sure what I expected.
11798,I would disown my kids if they got me a card. They know I think cards are a waste of money. I'd rather they just say Happy Father's Day. And spend the $4 on candy bar.
11799,"My Dad hated cards until I started buying cards that I would ""vandalize"" into something funny with doodles or writing things like ""UGHHHHHH FEELINGS"" if it was a mushy card."
11800,"My dad always vandalizes cards. One year for my birthday he thought it would be funny to get a card with a Menorah on it and turn the ""happy Hanukkah"" into a ""happy birthday"" with a big sharpie. Then he writes something offensive on the inside and signs it LYMI (love you, mean it). I still have every single card he's ever given me. I'm going to keep them forever."
11801,"Love it! For my 34th bday my Dad sent me a Hello Kitty card that said ""FOR A SPECIAL 4 YEAR OLD"" and he wrote a ""3"" in sharpie in front of the 4, lol."
11802,I aspire to become a dad like yours
11803,Unless money falls out. It just means I have to read something.
11804,"Fair enough! My Dad wasn't the kind of Dad who liked getting drawings and crafts from us as kids, so the fact he likes vandalized cards and will send vandalized cards means he is getting mushy in his old age, lol."
11805,Even better. My kids are still little though and they make them at school.
11806,This guy like bourbon? Plenty of good bottles to be had for less than $50.
11807,Certain scotches as well. Glenlivet 12 is like $42 a bottle.
11808,"Get him a bottle of  [Evan Williams Single Barrel] (https://drinkdistiller.com/#!/spirits/evan-williams-single-barrel) 
Most people don't realize it's higher rated than Pappy Van Winkle's and is under 50 bucks.   
Awesome stuff, even a better surprise if he hasn't had it before.  


Edit:  Sorry on my original post I said Weller Single Barrel.  I totally brain farted and meant Williams.  I edited it and added a link."
11809,"Glengoolie Blue, for the best Times."
11810,I asked the bartender the other night if they could get glengoolie blue. He just smiled and said no that he's already looked for it and it's not real.
11812,5 bottles of Rebel Yell
11813,Haha. Oh my god.
11814,"I have four brothers.  We have done the same thing our entire lives for our dad on Father's Day.  We all hand draw him a card.  We grew up in the country and my father was as much a child as we were.  He lead us to the point of death and my mother would pull us back just in time before we died.  Each year, we all pick different childhood stories and draw them as a card.  He has an entire collection now.  Broken bones, rocks to the forehead, attempted parasailing behind the truck, broken bones, fires, stitches, blood, ramps, explosions, wild animals, sword fights, tree houses, more broken bones, fights, disaster, sledding down the stairs, mud fights, cow poop fights, broken bones, concussions, casts, braces, flying machines, sledding to school behind the truck... and broken bones.  To name a few of the cards that have been illustrated to date."
11815,"Thats a lot of broken bones, even divided among 5 kids... Although the multiple instances of pulling kids behind the truck explains things a little. Sweet idea!"
11816,"It was awesome.  Never broke bones behind the truck.  I did go off a 13 foot cliff in a sled and that broke my collar bone.  Another fun thing to do is get a cheap canoe, tie it behind the truck, and use it as a sled through the fields.  Just don't fall out..."
11818,"A pair of jumper cables. Useful when the car doesn't want to start, or when you misbehave.

Fun all around."
11819,O god I thought you were him for a second I was ready for story time
11820,I did the same thing.  I was just waiting for the beat down.
11821,Don't let /u/rogersimon10 show up at your place
11822,I'm a dad and I want nothing in this thread so far.  You all disappoint me.  I will frown on behalf of your fathers.
11823,Well don't leave us hanging. What would you like?
11824,He would like a massage with a happy ending. He's just too shy to ask for it.
11825,"So you don't want a meal with your kids, movies, fishing, a card, beer, to be left alone or a phone call....that doesn't leave much...what would make you happy?"
11826,That's more like Dad
11827,"A Victorinox Swiss Army Knife. You can buy one for around $30-$50 and it is a gift that can be used for years to come. Also, some of the Alox models you can have engraved so he can keep it for years."
11828,Are you from 1899?
11829,Technically the tough ones we know today started in 1933 with the introduction of stainless steel.
11830,"Actually, 1903. Why do you ask?"
11831,He's a dad and the things that dads enjoy will remain the same for eternity. Dads are timeless.
11832,"Get him a Leatherman. It's way more useful than a Swiss army knife, unless he opens wine a lot. I use my Leatherman all of the time. I have the ""wave"" the ""wingman"" is cheaper but also pretty good. They sell them at home depot.

Edit: spelling"
11833,I bought my father a small victorinox pocket knife with his name engraved over 15 years ago and he still wears it as a keyholder. Everytime we went out of town or on a road trip and have to cut something he would smile and take out his pocket knife. Best 30.- CHF ever spent.
11834,Best what ever spent?
11835,Swiss francs
11836,http://shityoucanafford.com/ is pretty much dad heaven. Has best products on Amazon for $20.
11837,1500 ladybugs heading out to my dad right now.
11838,Holy cow this stuff is awesome!! I'm bookmarking this for Christmas too. I've got 4 teens. Stocking stuffers!  (Sorry about diverting attention from fathers. I'm female and my dad died 36 years ago. But dads are awesome. Go dads!)
11839,"Blowjob and a bottle of Whiskey. It's all we really want. Oh, and have the kid colour some bullshit and sign it."
11840,Jesus. I thought you meant from the kids...
11841,He did.
11842,A mouth is a mouth
11843,D:
11844,I'm not giving my dad a bottle of Whiskey
11845,"Something to commemorate the birth of his child. You can give typical Father's Day gifts down the road, but this is his first father's day..make it special. A framed photo with an engraving...something like that."
11846,"If you wanna be super cute about it, cut some big letters out of stiff construction paper ""DAD"" and take three photos of kid + letters. Then put them in a three-part frame for dad's desk."
11847,That's a great idea!
11848,"Shit, I think you're the only person here who actually read the text under the title."
11849,"Depending on how close to be 1 the kid is, laying down a sheet (to avoid a mess) and giving the kid some finger paint to put on poster board was a gift I was really excited about. My daughter was almost 1 and did it just fine. 

Bonus points if you use hand print of fingers prints to make a heart."
11850,"a phone call.   Thats all it takes.   I don't really want a gift.   Don't need one.  If I want something I am at the point in my life that I just go out and buy it.  
  Background.  I am 63 have 2 kids and 3 grandchildren.   

   Give me a call.   Happy fathers day...  bye.   All set for another year."
11851,This makes me sad :(
11852,Beer and get the hell out of the house for the day.
11853,This is quite opposite of the dad that just wants to have lunch with his kid.
11854,"""Dad, here is some beer. We are going to leave you alone for the day.""  Dad looks over, clutching his 20-year sobriety pin. He recalls the days when his family used to enjoy seeing him come home from work. ""I just don't want to be alone no more."" The son comes back at night to find the father has drunk himself to death. 

Wow, great advice OP."
11855,"I don't think drinking ""some beer"" will kill you."
11856,He choked.
11857,On his tears
11858,"Perhaps the son is a hipster, and ironically said ""some beer"" when in reality it was a pallet of Calgary."
11859,Probably the difference between having kids who live at home and kids who are out of the house already.
11860,"I'm not a religious man, but my Father is. So I'm getting him a Saint Joseph medallion for him to wear. He's the patron saint of fathers and carpenters, my Dad's profession. So if your father is a Christian, a medallion can be bought for around $20 online and can be a very meaningful gift."
11861,Catholic to be exact. Don't give this to non denominationals.
11862,"I just found the perfect gift for my SO, thank you."
11863,Boxes of ammo. Steam gift cards.
11864,Your dad seems cooler than mine.
11865,"First time dad, though. He's probably a youngblood"
11866,"Well, I got my Dad a book about a topic we both like and I'm plastering it with sticky-notes so basically he can 'read' the book with me and then when we talk about it, it will be more fun."
11867,It'll be just like the three of us are reading it together. :-D
11868,"Get something personalized. Yeah, you could get a gift card to that sporting goods store or a case of beer, but something personalized to your father will tug your father's emotional strings, and that's the greatest thing you can do."
11869,I got him an engraved cigar cutter and cigar travel case. Hopefully he loves it.
11870,A couple good quality hand made cigars. A really nice bottle of scotch. A nice leather wallet. Netflix subscription. A really good book. Subscription to a Japanese school girl porn website. Something that celebrates one of his hobbies. Hitachi magic wand. Black market Viagra script. Full DVD set of the Gilmore Girls. A bib so he can eat in the living room. One of those foot scrapers that sand off skin. A DVD compilation of Ron Jeremy's cum shots.
11871,"What the shit... I have been wearing this hat for like a year now. I thought it was a tool brand god damnit!

http://i.imgur.com/jklL4Fn.jpg

EDIT: Seriously, I'm still wearing this hat. Should I actually stop? Will anyone make the connection to the vibrators?"
11872,"still trying to hunt down a case of yuengling for my dad for fathers day

live in Illinois. local liquor store used to keep a couple cases in case people ever asked. was a secret thing, now they don't do it anymore because some chucklefuck actually complained about it. what a piece of shit."
11873,Damn man that blows. I live in Maryland just shy of the Pennsylvania border so I don't think there is a single place that sells alcohol that doesn't stock Yuengling.
11877,"My dad's never had an ice cream cake, so I'm getting him one specially made with teaberry ice cream(one of his favorites)."
11878,"My boyfriend (and baby daddy) said he wants to go fishing. He works a lot and just wants to get up early, drink some beer, and enjoy his day. I'm going to throw some sex and bacon at him before he goes though."
11879,You can find drones on Amazon with cameras for $50. A lot of which have free shipping. What dad doesn't want a spy drone.
11880,"Never really had one. If I did I think Id get him a sensible wood chopping axe. Maybe engraved with something classy, like 'kiss my axe'."
11881,2 lap dances and a beer
11882,don't know where you're going to get 2 lap dances and a beer for $50 unless you're paying your mom
11883,ma has all the moves
11884,"Well, that's some pretty expensive beer then!"
11885,10 bucks boobs only and 20 fully nude where I'm from.
11887,"An experience would better than an item: a massage, a ticket to a sporting event, a beer or wine tasting.  Something they can relax and enjoy.  Or, depending on the person, something they can enjoy with the new baby: infant/parent swim classes, tickets to the zoo."
11888,"Buy an experience with the kids.

My favorite part of Father's Day has nothing to do with gifts, but is about spending time with the family.  Baseball game, day of fishing, beach trip, go to the movies or whatever your Dad likes to do..."
11889,"My Mom isn't well so Dad has done the majority of the cooking for years.

He gets so happy when I bake a pie or some other kind of dessert.  Going out to eat is no big deal and he doesn't really NEED stuff.  But for him to be pampered.. he loves it.  

Mom couldn't leave the house so my husband and I prepared dinner and brought it for mother's day.  She wasn't happy but kept her insults about my cooking to a minimum but Dad was like a pig in sunshine.  He didn't have to leave the house to not have to cook!"
11890,"Whetstone & 3-in-1 oil.  Maybe a good leather strop and a ceramic stick, too.

Dads love to sharpen things, but most of those V-shaped kitchen knife sharpeners are shit."
11891,"I prefer a [Lansky 5 stone kit](http://lansky.com/index.php/products/dlx-5-stone-system/) myself.
The cutco knife guy left my house in shame :)"
11892,Dad here. I don't like that let alone love it.
11893,People forget that the only thing that is required to be a dad is to spawn. Beyond that they're still individuals!
11894,My dad died some time ago. I try to go fishing on Fathers Day because thats what we liked to do together.
11895,"I love how 90% of these come ents are beer and I'm just here like ""but my dad doesn't drink"""
11896,a pocket knife.
11897,Hitachi massager
11898,Mother's day was last month.
11899,"There are a few cool things I got my dad the past few years.  

A moss terrarium which are everywhere online are neat.  They're like bottles with a moss world inside them.  My dad is a pilot and weather enthusiast, so I always get him something themed to those hobbies.  Like a clock that looks like the gauges in the cockpit, or a storm glass.

Another neat gift for someone the age 30+ is a retro flip style alarm clock, but new!  I got one for my pops, real cool.  I actually want one.

Also loom at a ""cog clock.""  I thought that was a neat one."
11900,"Play dough is awesome for handprints and footprints once it drys you can keep it forever, you can even put it in a frame to dry!"
11901,"Protip: Cheap clay is around the same price, and doesn't crack when the moisture leaves it/it dries!"
54117,Beer

11909,"Rose scented fart pills  -  $31.31

I think i found the perfect gift.

11910,"Concerttickets. And buy 1 for yourself. Go together. 

Dads just want to spend time with you."
11911,"Not sure what your dad is into, but honestly anything that'll make whatever he does for work easier would be appreciated. Or anything to add on to whatever his favorite hobby is.

My dad is all about music so I'm looking at some vinyls and stuff for gifts"
11912,"Clean the house / other home stuff.  It's usually touted as a mom gift, but it works for Dads too.  Moreso if you focus on the things that tend to be Dad's domain, like mowing the lawn."
11913,"This! Clean my garage. Stack the tools you find, but I'll put them away."
11915,"My dad and I used to watch wiley coyote when I was a kid, it washes favourite cartoon. I bought him a dvd of all of those cartoons for less than £2. ( I am super skint right now, so I guess it is the thought that counts).  I would have taken him to the pub for a pint of bitter but we live 4h away from each other. Get something with memories attached if you can."
11916,I'm getting dad pepper plants. He likes peppers and he likes taking care of shit. For $50 I could get a whole set up going
11917,"http://indigonight.com

I gave my husband a photo of the night sky on the day our daughter was born, over the skyline of our city. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sGq0CQC.jpg)"
11918,"I got my dad a bottle of port for $17. If he is a whiskey drinker I would recommend Woodford Reserve or maybe whiskey stones.

Get him something for his desk at work or home: business card holder, a handmade dish for keys or change, a framed photo.

For his car: a seat cushion?

For his workout: bluetooth headphones, a gym bag, a fast drying gym towel."
11919,Bag of chips.
11920,You could buy some specialty beers!
11921,"Fire TV Stick. Side load it with Kodi

My dad is a tv nut. With tutorials on YouTube it's easy to do and for those 40 bucks and access to a wifi network he can watch pretty much anything on the planet. Including live TV."
11922,Yoink! Thank you. Grabbing that one for ME! You know - a dad
11923,Some specialty or gourmet hot sauce.  You can even order gift baskets or combo-packs.
11924,"New Balances. Also, can’t go wrong with a book"
11925,New Balances are racist!
11926,My dad went crazy for socks with right/left markers on them.
11927,Lmao
11928,"Flashlight. I dont care who your dad is, he is always cool with a better flashlight"
11929,"..and if he's single, maybe a Fleshlight?"
11930,"Beat meat to it! /r/fleshlight can help you choose a good one.

If he's more of a hands-on DIY guy, then go for a prostitute.  My dad is inseperable from his."
11931,"Beat me to it!  /r/flashlight can help you choose a good one.

If he's more of a hands-on DIY guy then go for a headlamp.  My dad is inseparable from his."

He just moved and wants to start a little mancave so I'm helping him boost that."
11933,Giant tube of Jaffa Cakes
11934,"Something practical like some tools, a pair of sneakers/boots, a nice jacket(I recommend Milwaukees heated hard shell jacket) or get something luxury like a nice watch once in a while."
11935,"A 1:1 size model of a knee.

My dad (52) keeps complaining about his."
11936,A warm beanie and some fancy coffee beans
45015,Cast iron skillet
11938,Sent my dad ice cream from the Penn State Creamery last year. Huge hit.
11939,Old Spice gift set with aftershave and cologne.
11940,Bottle of bourbon and a few hours of damned silence.
11941,"My dad collected hot wheels, so I would go and get $30-$40 worth of them and wrap them individually. When he passed away he left me a steamer trunk full of them, still in the boxes. I have the trunk in my attic and still add to it on christmas and his birthday. One day I'll pass them down to my kids if I have any."
11942,Awesome to hear that you are keeping it up!
11945,How/Why are you responding to a 2 month old post of mine with 11 upvotes?? Thank you for the suggestion!
11946,"I mean, like for any gift, figure out what your dad would like. My city used to have a baseball team, we used to go see a lot of games together. So I'm getting him tickets to the preseason games that are coming to my city this spring"
11947,"Last year I took our daughter out for most of the day so he could play video games without distractions. And I gave him a BJ before we went to bed. This year I will do the same, plus I got him the X-wing lego set."
11948,You seem nice. I like you.
11949,"Read that in the voice of that girl in ""Up""."
11950,My god I read that like you gave your dad a BJ then...
11952,"According to this story, I would say no."
11953,"That X-wing is amazing, if we are talking about the same set. Prepare some place to display it, as it does come with a stand."
11954,"I didn't get the red 5, I got the smaller version. Red 5 was too expensive, but at least I got enough Lego to get Darth Revan."
11955,The blowjob is a nice thought....but shouldn't happen so infrequently that it's considered a treat.
11956,"The bj isn't super special, it's just guaranteed that night. I would give him one just because I fell like it."
11957,"For me, my perfect Father's Day gift would be like a normal day with my family, but without the responsibility part.  So, I wake up in the morning and have coffee with my wife.  When the kids start getting antsy, I  get to leave and go to the bookstore by myself for two hours.  Then I come home and show my wife the books that I bought and she thinks that I made really good choices.  Then the kids show me the lego things they built for me, and I get to admire them.  Then my wife puts the kids down for a nap, while I skim reddit for a few minutes.  Then we get to watch Orphan Black on our computer for a few hours while the kids sleep.  Then when they are up, we all go to the park, and I get to talk more with my wife while we watch the kids play.  Then we all go to In-N-Out where I get to have a double-double w/ onions and animal fries and a chocolate milkshake, and I don't even feel bad about it.  Then we go home, and the kids give me a home-made card that says, ""We love you, Daddy!,"" and my wife gives me a card that says, ""World's sexiest Husband.""  Then I am feeling really good about myself, and after the kids go to bed, I bury my face in my wife's ample bush."
11958,"I am not a father (yet), but I definatly confirm the double-double w/ onions and animal fries and a chocolate milkshake at In-N-Out part is definatly true for me."
11959,"As a Canadian, a ""Double-double with onions"" doesnt sound too appetizing....."
11960,"Double-double is coffee here in Canada, so personally, I would prefer it without onions"
11961,That makes so much sense now. I've seen Canadians post previously about being confused in reference to In-N-Out double-doubles. I've always wondered what coffee had to do with burgers!
11962,"> I bury my face in my wife's ample bush.

Well, I did not see that coming."
11963,">Well, I did not see that coming.

But hopefully, /u/bigcalal did."
11964,/r/unexpected
11965,So you're a Bushman?
11966,After a long enough period of time in a marriage there is little choice for the husband...
11967,"Wife here. Can confirm. The bush, is back."
11968,Mine never left.
11969,I...I feel obligated to make this happen...
11970,"That last line at the end. Would kill any child's innocence. Sweet loving father suddenly turned into a wild animal, a monster with monstrous appetite"
11971,I don't think the word 'ample' has ever made me feel so uncomfortable
