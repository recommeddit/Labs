46268,">    How many pieces of candy do I hand out per kid? Does it change based on age?

One or two of ""fun size"" is acceptable, if you only have a few kids in your neighborhood it can be nice to just get a couple ""king size"" or normal  sized candy bars/packages.  If you're up for it, give bonus candy for good jokes.




>    Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

Whichever you're comfortable with.  I usually keep only some of the candy in a bowl and allow them to pick a few pieces.  For small children, put it in their bags (They have a hard enough time telling you a joke).


>    I've purchased about 250 pieces of candy (good stuff like mini versions of starburst, snickers, almond joy, butterfingers, etc). Is this enough?

You are the best kind of house.  Mix them together and fill your bowl as needed.  You'll be fine with that much (it'll last a few hours in most places)


>    I'm too lazy to decorate or dress up. But how do I make it clear I'm giving out candy? Just turn on the lights and keep door open?

turn on the lights, makes sure you're well lit.  People will come if there is light.  Theres no need to dress up.

>    How long do I have to stand by the door? I was thinking 5-8 pm.


Most places have a set time for ticker treating.  Usually ending at 9, but you can do it for however long you want.

>    What happens do I run out of candy? How do I prevent people from TPing my house?


Turn off your light.  People usually only TP people they know, and for the most part, people don't TP that much anymore.  TP is too expensive now :p"
46269,">If you're up for it, give bonus candy for good jokes.

Hmmm.... I like this! I didn't realize this is part of the tradition. Sounds like a lot of fun. One of our neighbors have a Ron Paul sign in the yard. Maybe he will make the kids recite the Constitution.

>You are the best kind of house

Yay! I hope so. Thank you so much for all your help."
46270,"Joke telling isn't part of the tradition, it's just something he does. None of your visitors will expect this."

46272,"My favorite lady to go to in my town, had a little scary game or something you had to do every year, and then you got a regular size candy bar or reeses etc.

Like one year she had a little scary setup like a stage and you had to sing a song for 10 seconds and if she really liked your song you got 2 candy bars instead of 1

My other personal favorite was the dude who gave out cans of COKE, IT WAS AWESOME
you are always so thirsty after eating candy and so it was the one I went to in the middle of my trick or treating route!

Good Luck You are an awesome neighbor!"
46273,This ONE house in neighborhood has ALWAYS given out [these bottles of Kool-Aid](http://www.x-entertainment.com/kool-aid/reviews/bursts/2.jpg). It was amazing because if you weren't thirsty you could save it for later. That house was the best
46274,"Insta ""Don't Stop Believin"" right there for the song..."

46297,">Just make it last

Believe it or not the idea of getting the right amount is giving me anxiety attacks. I want to get enough for kids, but not so much that I'll continue eating the candy for weeks.

46299,Wow really? I'm loving this holiday more and more!
46300,yeah dude... welcome to america. we have 2 holidays that are solidly based around candy: valentines and halloween... and the stores always MASSIVELY cut the price of their back stock the very next day...
46301,It gets up to 70-90% off if you get it at the right time.
46302,"2-3 ""fun size"" bars is easily enough per kid. Some houses will just give one. Also, you should leave your door closed and just watch t.v. or something. They will knock."
46303,2-3 is a good rule of thumb. Thanks!
46305,"Always try to have some backup candy. There are a lot of children that have to trick or treat much later in the night (parents work night shift, etc.). I always keep my porch light on because I always have one of those kids and they are so happy to get any candy."
46306,Walking to the door naked usually says you're not participating. But the key word here is USUALLY.

46313,Don't let the kids grab if you think you might run low. They'll take a handful each.
46314,"I always let the kid pick their candy out of the bowl. I know some kids can't eat nuts, so if you gave them a snickers or almond joy that would suck, but some kids don't eat gelatin so they don't want a starburst. This way everyone can get candy they can eat.  If you run out of candy (I doubt you will) just turn your lights off. I've seen some people in the past take out their screen doors so that they don't have to open it each time."
46315,"Answer door naked, or atleast with your penis out. Invite children inside, offer to give them baths or help them shower, that's typical halloween etiquette."
46316,"Grab a handful throw it into their bucket/pillowcase/whatever.

Turn off your porch light when you run out of candy."
46317,Good advice thanks! You just made me open my candy bags to check how many I can grab with my hands (about 6). Now the challenge is to NOT eat the candy I just opened.
46318,"Well It also depends on the candy. If you're giving out cheap shit (smarties, sweet tarts, lolipops) like I do, 6 is cool. But if you're giving the good stuff like snickers, butterfingers or what have you, 2-3 is cool."
46319,I love sweet tarts! Maybe I should come to your house after I'm done.
46320,"Wow it's really interesting to see the questions a non-American has about halloween. They seem so in depth and thought out!

There's no set amount of candy you have to give out or anything. Some houses will let the kids dig in and take all they want and others will hand out a single piece to each. You probably want to be somewhere in the middle.

Leaving the lights on should be plenty to attract kids. I'm sure decorations help but I remember going to EVERY house that wasn't completely dark so I don't think you'll have any issues. 

5-8 sounds good and I'm sure it'll start winding down at 730ish. By the way, you don't have to stand right at the door. Kids will ring the doorbell. 

I don't know how prevalent TPing is down there but you'll probably be fine with the lights on, etc. If you do get TPed, keep in mind that it's probably nothing you did or didn't do. It's just some 14 year olds who are bored and like thinking that they're causing trouble."
46321,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful answers! Yeah, I might be worried too much over nothing. But while I haven't experienced Halloween, I have seen it a lot in the movies (like ET for example). Of course the movie trick-or-treating scenes are probably more exciting than the real thing, but I may have built up an expectation over the event. I'm really excited though!

I don't mind so much the actual TPing as the thought behind it. I don't mind cleaning up, but I don't want kids to dislike my house because I gave out crappy candy."
46322,"Don't worry, by the sounds of it you have everything covered. Those doing the TPing aren't usually getting candy anyways. 

Good luck!"
46323,Thanks Kevin. I'm really excited. :)
46324,"Trenchcoat, dark sunglasses, and a black, unmarked van in the driveway."
46325,"- 1 to 2 pieces per kid is sufficient. Usually give two if they're really small, like tootsie rolls. 
 - Don't let older kids pick from a bowl. They mill around looking for a specific piece. It's annoying if you have a shit ton of kids. 
 - I'd think 250 is enough. I usually end up buying too much and start giving kids more towards the end of the night. 
 - Just turn your light on. No need to dress up or anything. 
 - 5-7 or 8 is fine. I usually wait till it started dying down or I run out of candy, which seems to be between  7 and 8. 
 - Don't worry about anyone doing anything to your house. Doesn't really happen. 

Watch out for older kids. Those bastards will come back to your house multiple times, they linger around later hoping to get more candy, and they're pushy."
46326,"You get a costume that includes a mask and gloves. Sit in a chair on your porch, with the bowl in your lap. Have a sign somewhere that says ""Take one"". When the kids reach into the bowl, grab their hand and yell."
46327,Oh man this is awesome ha ha. I might have to try this once in my life. :)
46328,Dispensing it from the back of your white van is considering something of a faux pas.
46329,"Ask your neighbours to estimate how many kids they got last year.  Adjust candy amounts accordingly.  

Let the kids pick, it makes it more fun for them.  I always give out full size candy.  The kids lose it with excitement when they get not only a large chocolate but get to pick between their favourites."
46330,"To indicate that you are candy-handing, make sure that your address light in the front yard is on. This is the universal sign for 'even though the house isn't made up, I've still got the goods.

There are two common approaches to candy-handing: the 'leave the bowl out and pretend kids are responsible' approach, and the 'let me see how scary you are!' approach.

In the first, you put all your candy in one large container outside of your front door, ignore your gut feeling that some jerk kid is going to take more than his fill, and go about your business. You can put a sign out that informs them not to take more than a couple pieces, but honestly, nobody regards those.

The second approach is a little more complicated, in that you actually deal out candy yourself. If you have a screen door, the best way to know that the kids are outside is to leave your door open, with the screen door closed, that way you can hear them and be ready before they get to the doorbell. The kids exclaim 'trick or treat!' and you hand out the candy. However, there are a couple of approaches to doing the actual hand-off, as well. You can:

* hold a big container out for them to select from, and let them know how many to take

OR

* drop/ throw pieces into their bags as they hold them open for you. If you choose this route and accidentally drop their candy on the ground, it is common courtesy to cry ""whoops!"", pick it up yourself, place it into their bags, and then hand them an extra piece or two for the inconvenience.

Most children will be trick-or-treating from the brink of sundown until about 8pm. If you run out of candy, don't worry about it, just be sure to turn off the light out front to avoid any confusion. TP'ing of houses is far less common than what's conveyed in the media; if you're nice and hand out decent candy, (which it looks like you are) you'll have nothing to worry about. Be sure to compliment kids' costumes, and tell them just how scary they are. Be ready to be extra gentle to the little kids who are more frightened of approaching you for candy than any Halloween ghoul they'll encounter.

NOTE: just because the kids yell 'trick-or-treat' doesn't mean you should take them up on it and suggest they perform a trick in exchange for candy. It puts the kids on the spot, and can be a good way to get yourself TP'd."
46331,"i was always that kid that got super pissed off when i took the time to walk up to someones front door and they only gave me one piece of candy. especially when it was like, one tootsie roll or something. two is always best, its not to gracious, but you also won't be that one house that gives out one tootsie roll because they're cheap. kids know this stuff."
46332,"A good neighbor will participate in a neighborhood watch program.

Put little notes in each trick-or-treaters basket that says 'come over any time. i'm always here from 8-3 in case you feel like skipping school.'

Then watch your neighbors."
46333,I wonder if they have reddit in prison. Guess I'll find out!
46334,"1. Whichever kid takes the most candy slingshot-ed point blank in the face without crying gets that many pieces of candy.
2. You hold the bowl as close to your crotch as possible then let them take it out of the bowl.
3. Buy some insulin for every 10 pieces of candy. You should buy 25 bottles of insulin and give them to kids with the candy.
4. Chase kids near your house, slingshotting them with candy while telling them to grab some candy from your crotch/bowl.
5. Stay until their parents come to the door asking what the hell is happening.
6. When you run out of candy provide them with a trick, when they come to the door and yell ""trick or treat"" go to the door and collapse. Hold your breath for as long as you can and then get up and close the door. 
To prevent TPing place bear traps throughout your yard and sling shot the Tpers with rocks. 
I hope this advice helped and that you will have an awesome halloween


edit:spelling"
46335,Remember that teenagers sometimes just want candy too! Don't act rude if they show up. They normally don't want to cause trouble. They just want candy and aren't willing to spend the money.
46336,No razorblades or roofies. Everything else is fair game.
46337,"Looks like you got most of the advice you were looking for. I know you said you weren't wanting to dress up, but if you want to sit out on the porch and watch the trick or treaters, wearing a costume and scarring the older ones is the way to go. My aunt would a few costumes stuffed on her porch as decoys and she would scare the kids as the got the candy out of the bowl. If you don't mind my asking, where are you originally from?"
46338,"Keep your outdoor lights on if you still have candy.  If you turn off all the outdoor lights, it indicates to the children that you are either out of candy or not giving out candy.

When children come to the door, they will knock or ring your door bell and say trick or treat when you open the door.  You can put as much candy as you like into each child's bag, but one is enough.  The children will be going to a lot of homes and will get lots of candy.  You don't need to give them more than one.

5-9PM would probably be a better time to wait up and you still might get teenage trick or treaters after that.  You might even get trick or treaters the day after Halloween as that is what I did when I was young.  Many people would stock up on candy but wouldn't be able to give it all out so I went to everyone's home the day after Halloween and asked them if they had any spare candy they wanted to get rid of.  Didn't even need a costume.

Unless you're doing some sort of active haunted house or something, do something near the entrance of your house (inside) that will keep you occupied but is ok to get interrupted with.  Watching kids walk around the neighborhood to each house is a lot like watching children walking around a mini-golf course.  One family will go up to a house and trick or treat and then a few minutes later another family will come along and do it.

If you don't have anything special to do, you can sit outside your house and give children candy as they pass by.

You should also get some ""bad"" candy.  Not candy that is poisoned or anything but candy that children really don't enjoy eating, like apples and oranges and fruits and grapes and crap that people don't consider as candy.  Some kids might come to your house not wearing a costume or saying they are ""an average American student, derp.""  Give these kids without costumes the bad candy or fruit.

If you enjoy the process of giving out candy on Halloween, stock up on King Size candy bars for next year.  Give each child that trick or treats at your house a king size Snickers or king size Reese's or king size Kit Kat.  The year after, everyone will realize you're the good home to trick or treat at and all the children will come to you.

If you are a registered (or closet) pedophile, you should probably just leave all your lights off and not participate in Halloween at all."
46339,"Okay, here's a step by step: 

- make sure your lights are on. You could put a pumpkin outside if you want to make sure they know to come up. 

- the kids will knock or ring the doorbell (if you want to leave the door open or sit on the porch, you can, but you don't have to)

- They'll say ""Trick or Treat!!!!"" It'll probably be really loud. 

- Say some variation of ""wow, look at these great costumes!"" You can ask who they're dressed as, or (if you can tell clearly) you can guess who they are or (if it's totally obvious) you could call them by the name of the character (i.e. Hi there, Superman! Are you taking time off from protecting the world to get some candy?"" That's all just fancy stuff you can say to go the extra mile. At the least, compliment their costumes.

- Kids wearing scary costumes like to be told how scary they look!

- As a kid, I liked being able to dig my hand in the bowl and pick my own. You can say ""Only take one, please!"" or ""Only take two"" if you're being generous. If that makes you uncomfortable, you can pick pieces for each kid. One or two (depending on size) is totally normal. 

- Once they have the candy, they'll move to the next house. Parents urge them to say thank you, so they most likely will. 

- Say ""You're welcome! Happy Halloween!"" and you're done!"

46343,">because its awkward walking up to a house with someone staring you down until you reach the door

That's a good tip! Thank you so much. I was indeed planning on staring at people as they come up--just to people watch and check out costumes as kids go by. Now I know that's creepy.  =)"
46344,"haha well if you look out the windows to see if anyone is coming (and they cant see you) its fine. i remember as a kid i hated people just staring at me for like 50 feet before i got to their house. or the worst was when i got to their door and right before i could ring the doorbell they would open it! just let me knock and say trick or treat properly! but yes, have fun!"
46345,"When I lived in an area that got kids we'd typically do 1 piece per kid, if they had an exceptional costume we'd give them a couple pieces extra."
46346,give out as much candy as you can to the first 12 kids
46347,"Lets kids TAKE one piece, makes sure we don't get gross candy. Porch light on means your open, off means closed. Generally one or two pieces, depending on time of the night or whether you're in a high traffic neighborhood.

Don't gibe out almond joys, generally kids don't like them. However parents usually do. Straight chocolate or big lollipops are always good. Pretzels and gummies work, I always liked those. Don't do the popcorn thing, just annoying and they get crushed anyways."

46355,r/shittyadvice. I'd love to see what they say.
46356,Don't. Kids are germ-ridden animals.
46357,"Couple of pieces of ""fun sized"" candy is plenty. If the kid's parents are anything like mine, they will comb through it and throw out anything that didn't have a factory-sealed wrapper."
46358,"It's only okay once a year, and never out of a van."
46359,"1. You could probably get away with one piece, but unless someone is giving out larger candy, generally two or three pieces per child. Generally, it's more important that you give all children the same amount of candy- kid's won't mind if one house is a bit stingy, but they will mind if their friend gets more candy than they do. Of course, even this isn't that big of a deal.
2. I recommend dropping it in the bag. Giving kids free reign of the bowl is opening yourself up to some kids fighting to grab more. 
3. Honestly, no idea. I don't have much experience in actually purchasing candy (all my knowledge comes from experiencing distribution on the side of the trick or treater or distributing candy at home, but in the latter cases I was just doing it for my parents, and have no idea how much they actually gave me to hand out) This is also going to vary on how busy a neighborhood you live in. 
4. Turn on the lights. Unless you are in a VERY busy neighborhood, you probably won't want to leave the door open continuously. If you want to try sitting out on the porch and handing out candy, some people do that, but generally those are the kind of people who get really into the holiday, as opposed to the people who simply answer the door when people come and watch TV in the meanwhile.
5. My advice? Don't stand by the door. If you can, just hang out in a front room, and do something else simultaneously- watch TV, read a book, browse reddit. The kids will knock or ring the bell, then go to the door, give them candy, close the door (unless another group is close on their heels, in which case waiting a moment is probably a good idea). Eventually, the number of kids should die down, or you'll run out of candy. 
6. And finally, just turn off your lights. You will probably get a few kids who try your door anyway, but just don't answer. They'll assume you're out of candy if you don't answer. However, when you're done distributing, try to make it look like you're not home- you could very well annoy someone if you're just hanging out in a front window in plain view but aren't answering the door."
46360,"Porch light means candy. The amount of candy is directly proportional to age... somewhat. The 10 year olds get a bunch of candy, the 16 year-olds can go fuck themselves. Looking back on myself at that age, no one should have given me candy at all; I was a bastard. If you get the good candy (fun sized good candy) a couple pieces is solid. If you get the tootsie rolls and smarties, 5-6 pieces no problem. You will get the hand of it. Just remember, when you run out of candy, turn that light off."
46361,">How many pieces of candy do I hand out per kid? Does it change based on age?

Different houses do different things.  One-per is normal, though.  It certainly doesn't change with age.

>Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

Depends.  If you have lots of different kinds of candy, bring out the bowl and let them choose.  If you have just one, do either one, because both are accepted.

>I've purchased about 250 pieces of candy (good stuff like mini versions of starburst, snickers, almond joy, butterfingers, etc). Is this enough?

Ask your neighbors.  We don't know what the population density of your particular suburb is, nor how far from home parents are willing to let their kids wander in their never-ending and ever-futile quest to sate their insatiable candylust.

>I'm too lazy to decorate or dress up. But how do I make it clear I'm giving out candy? Just turn on the lights and keep door open?

Leave the lights on, that *should* be enough.  Kids tend to travel in large packs in part because it makes walking up to potentially unwilling houses and ringing the doorbell less scary.  At least, that's a big reason my friends always traveled in groups of 5+ on Halloween.

>How long do I have to stand by the door? I was thinking 5-8 pm.

Well, there's typically ~5 minutes between each pack of trick or treaters where I'm from, so pull up a chair.  5-8 sounds about right, but unless you've got some compelling reason to leave the house or go to a different room, why not just surf Reddit five feet from the door until the trick-or-treaters stop coming or you run out of candy?

>What happens do I run out of candy?

May God have mercy on your soul.

>How do I prevent people from TPing my house?

You're in Texas, right?  You're going to want at least two trained bloodhounds, a shotgun, and as many hours at the range as you can manage to squeeze in between now and Halloween night.  In all seriousness, giving out good candy will help your cause, but some kids just want to watch the world burn."
46362,Since when are Butterfingers good candy?
46363,"Leave your porch lights on, and give each child about a fistful of candy. If you let them grab it they'll take half of it in one swipe."
46364,"Step 1: Buy a bunch of apples

Step 2: stuff razor wires in them

Step 3: Give them to children

Step 4: ????

Step 5: PROFIT!!!"
46365,"As a former champion trick-or-treater turned candy-bestower, here is what I think:

* One of two, probably two, just incase you get that polite kid who's allergic to almond that doesn't want to say anything when he gets an almond joy. Little kids tend to get one (ie. infant- 3) because they simply can't handle that much candy, and won't eat it anyways.

* I recommend dropping it in the bag, so you won't be faced with the future-douchebag-of-America child who thinks taking 8 pieces is fair game.

* If you give 2 to each, you'd have enough candy for 125 kids, which sounds like a good amount, but if there are a shit ton of kids in the area, you might run out. This is totally a judgement call. (Reminder: if you have ""too much"" it'll just result  in you having extra candy. This can never be a bad thing.)

* If you turn on a front light, in your yard or in your front hall, kids will know that you have candy to give them.

* If you have a doorbell, or if your usual haunt in your house is close to the door, kids can knock, so you don't have to sit by the door, but 5-8 is a good time where most kids will come through. You might have a few stragglers, however.

* If you run out of candy, just shut off the lights. I've never heard of someone's house getting TPed because they didn't have any candy left."
46366,make them reach into your pocket and get it.
46367,"""Oh hey, King Sized candy!"""
46368,"""I hear that if you rub it, it grows bigger."""
46369,1 x full size candy bar each. Upgrade to King size if you want to become the stuff of neighborhood legends.
46370,"1-2 pieces is good, let the kids pick there own.   
  
  
  I was always disappointed when we finally got to a house with twix or whatever favorite of mine I was lacking in that night and THEN they would hand me candy that I didn't want as much. I was obviously still happy, because it's candy. But it was still disappointing. =[   
  
  
  Also everyone has mentioned turning on your porch light. Where I grew up it was normal for people to sit on their porches are driveways. Some people are saying that it's creepy to watch the kids walk up to your house, but I always thought Halloween was kind of like a parade. It's fun watching all the kids run around the neighborhood dressed up! I guess you could wait and see if other neighbors are doing the same, before you decide whether to sit outside or not.   
  
  
  Most people won't be upset if you run out of candy, just turn your porch light off, maybe write a note on the door that says sorry (with a sad face, so they know you're sincere) Have fun! =]"
46371,"From the back of an unmarked, old-model van. Entice the children with promises of free kittens and/or puppies along with the candy.

You'll be the hit of the neighborhood!"
46372,That sounds like fun! But where can I get puppies at this late hour?
46373,"American here since i popped out of my moms uterus, in order for your first successful halloween grab a big bowl of delicious candy, when they ring your door throw a handful at their faces as you laugh maniacally and dance over their young delicious weeping bodies."
46374,"I'm surprised I didn't see this yet, but keep track of how many kids!

We keep a pad of paper and after they left add the number.  That way next year you have a better idea how much candy to buy.

We've had 65-80 kids every year for the last 5 years.  It's very neighborhood dependent though..."
46375,I would just hand out pieces of bite sized chocolate (Hershey's) to the kids (two each). If you let them grab it they may take a lot more. I would also just leave the lights on. I wouldn't want to put decorations out because it only attracts more kids. I just want to get it over with.
46376,"from what I remember as a kid.... you open the door & immediately not recognize what the kids are dressed up as because you are so out of touch with child fads/culture.  Then you say something like.... ""ooooo look at all the scary... eh...um... so what are you supposed to be?"" Then when the kids tell you .... you STILL have no idea what they are talking about because you still have never heard of it. Then you stumble about verbally saying something like ""Ooooo how scary!"" then you either give or offer some candy.... typically the crappy hard candy kind. Rarely ever the good chocolate kind. 

When i was a kid I went dressed up as a [Gamorian Guard](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/6/64/Gamorrean-hd.jpg) & not a single person knew what I was. One old bat asked who I was & when i told her.... she said ""oooo a goodmorning Guard"""
46377,"We usually get a few hobos, and they get candy, too. Just don't compliment their costume."
46378,"When someone comes to your door throw it open violently, scream at the top of your lungs, throw a handful of candy bars at them as hard as you can, then slam the door shut.  The next day post your results here on reddit.  I will then disavow all knowledge of this advice."
46379,"In my neighborhood, kids would start coming by at 4:30 and stop at around 11:00.  Just sit next the the door with a TV or something."
46380,"Nope, all wrong. You have to buy at least a thousand king size candy bars of varying kinds for a *small* neighborhood. When the kids come to your door, offer them as much as they want. This is how to correctly do Halloween."
46381,"Whatever you do, do NOT put razorblades in any of the food stuffs. In fact, for the peace of mind of the parents, only give out stuff which is sealed in one form or another.

If kids say ""Trick or Treat"", they're asking for a trick or a treat. When you run out of treats, it's time to give them tricks. Hide in the bushes with a garden hose and douse them down real good (relevant [Calvin & Hobbes](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/10/31))"
46382,"3 is a good number, or make little baggies with varying amounts and then hand out a baggie to each kid. Don't let them choose, they'll take half the bowl. Yes that's plenty, but you should have a little bad just in case. You should go get a cheap mask, but yeah a light and open door usually signify candy giver. If you run out, just turn off your light. No one will TP you."
46384,">this allows kids to be happier picking candy they want

Thanks! That's a great point. This will also mean I'll get stuck with one kind of really unpopular candy. My money is on Whoopers underperforming."
46385,"ARE YOU SERIOUS!

WHOOPERS ARE THE SHIT BRO"
46386,"They're not bad. But can they stand up against the likes of Reese Pieces, Snickers, Almond Joy, and 100 Grand?"
46387,Take Two > all other candies.
46388,"SNICKERS = NO
100 Grand = NO
Reese Pieces = YES
Almond Joy = YES

=50% so its a toss up

Change to Reeses Cups and you win! And I do enjoy a almond joy as well so you might have a point but I am sticking to my 50%!"
46389,"See I dig Snickers though. 100 Grand might not win out with kids, but I think they'd take that over Almond Joy."
46390,Those things are a bitch to open.
46391,"What my family has always done:


Give no more than 3 pieces to each kid.  If they are young they get more.  If they are really young then they only get one.  Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized. 


edit: if they are dressed really cool the get more.


Put the candy in the bag, don't let them pick out of the bowl.


Candy sounds good.  250 pieces should be enough.


Just turn on the front lights. And have the door open.


5-8 should be fine


If you run out of candy: Set an empty bowl out side in front of the door and close it.  But keeps the lights on.  Lights off will make you look like someone who wasn't giving out candy at all.  (then hope.  TP isn't bad eggs are)"
46392,">Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized

I dunno. I kinda wished adults can go trick-or-treating. So I probably won't make fun of kids who are too old.

>If you run out of candy: Set an empty bowl out side in front of the door and close it. But keeps the lights on. Lights off will make you look like someone who wasn't giving out candy at all. (then hope. TP isn't bad eggs are)

Quite possibly the best advice in this thread (which has a ton of great advice). I will definitely do this. Thank you so much for coming out of lurking to help me out."
46394,Ha ha nice! Good luck this year. I hope you have a great Halloween.
46395,"Adults don't go trick or treating, they buy costumes and tequila and rage like its <Insert year of prime> again."
46396,">Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized.

As an *adult* this me me sad. ='("
46397,"If someone has tried with their costume, I don't care if they are 28, they can have candy.

If someone has half-assed or no-assed it it and looks 15 or older... I believe I shall require some form of entertainment to dispense candy."
46398,">Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized.

As a teenager this made me sad :("
46399,"I usually give two pieces per kid. Just drop it in their bag (or else they'll start to get picky. They can always trade with friends/family later). I would buy a bit more candy since I tend to munch on it between waves of kids. Definitely lights on. I usually sit out on the stoop until I run out of candy because otherwise I would be getting up every five seconds. Little kids might start a bit earlier than 5pm, just keep going until you run out of candy. When you run out of candy, you put a sign on your door ""Out of candy :("" and keep an eye on the window. Have fun!"
46400,"Leave the porch light on; that is the sign that you are handing out candy. Leave the door open if you don't want the bell ringing every thirty seconds. There is nothing wrong with handing out one or two pieces per kid, although if it is a really good kid or especially good costume, I will give a little extra. Don't leave the bowl outside, and don't offer them the bowl unless you are prepared to be a dick when they inevitably try to take advantage of you.

If/when you run out of candy, just turn off your porch light/unplug any Halloween lights, close your door, and leave a nice note saying something like ""Sorry, out of candy. See you next year!"" Most kids will just pass by when they see paper on the door. I live in a pretty nasty neighborhood, and I have never had problems with TPing or egging or anything, but keep any pets inside tomorrow and Monday. People can get nasty around Halloween.

Have fun!"
46401,"If the kid can't spell Halloween, the candy is for the parents.  Give him an extra chocolate bar and tell him it's for his fatass mom.  Tell the kid to ask her why she needs so much candy.

If the kid is sarcastic when he spells it, he's too old for it.  But, his parents are probably dicks and don't buy him fuckall.  Tell him to explain his justification for his costume, then give him  a handful and close your door on his face.  You'll each think you've won.

If the kid is proud he knows how to spell it and smiles whilst doing so, give him a second handful.  He'll need it to bribe the bullies from giving him atomic wedgies from now til Christmas break.  By then, hopefully, his mom will put some clothes under the tree that don't make him look so gay."
46402,I see you've given this a lot of thought my friend. Bravo. :p
46403,"Give each kid one. Then at the last second, give up another one or two because their costumes are so cool/the best you've seen so far/whatever."
46404,Usually I just got excited when they would hand out full candy bars rather than fun-size.
46405,A religious pamphlet - said no child ever.
46406,There was the guy that gave out cans of soda.
46407,Shots of Jamison from my ridiculously hot neighbor.
46408,"Like, temperature-wise?"
46409,Heh. Her costume was super tiny. I doubt it. Rather chilly evening
46410,"Full sized chocolate bars,  not those smack sized ones"
46411,"Yup, those are the ones I give out on Halloween.  I'm trying to become the cool house on the block."
46412,I got one of those.  From the town dentist.  No joke.
46413,He knows something you don't.
46414,Cash!
46415,"When I was young, some lady used to give every trick-or-treater one quarter.  Like wow, thanks a lot lady..."
46416,Bunch of Hershey bars. It was 11:30 and the house was sort of behind other houses so she got very little visitors
46417,"I'd be that shitty kid who emptied the bowls that some families left by their front door.

Those were pretty big hauls, usually."
46418,Who could resist the unattended bowl
46419,"This year I'm bringing back the trick aspect. For every 2 full size candy bars i give out, I'm giving a rock to the third kid."
46420,"The trick aspect is a thinly-veiled threat the children use to extort treats from you. Are you going to give into their demands and placate them with sweets, or are they going to have to make your life miserable? Tricking *them* is just kicking a hornets nest."
46421,Then war it shall be!
46422,"We live in a middle class neighborhood, so we would get the random assortment of things.

But we lived near a rich gated neighborhood. It was closed off during Halloweeen, but my friends knew a storm tunnel to go through.

Boy was it worth it.

After several houses we came back with a quarter pillow case full of soda cans and full sized candy bars. Even the people who didn't have the big stuff just gave us handfuls of candy.

The next year they put a metal grate on the drain."
46423,"Best - Full sized candy bars *(whatever)*


Worst - Cans of peas from my next door neighbor *(fuckers)*"
46424,Fried chicken has always been my favorite food. My grandparents used to wrap up a drumstick in foil for me every year. It's one of my fondest memories of them.
46425,"When I was 14 me and my friends went to a house that was kind of set back from the other houses at the end of this crescent.  This dude answered the door and he was surprised that anyone showed up at all.  He and some friends were playing poker, and they had no candy so they gave us each a can of beer.

We drank the beer, then went back and knocked again.  They gave us each another beer.  The third time they said no."
46426,I mean you can't just give away the entire six pack
46427,A razor blade.

of some Chunky Campbell's Soup-

46434,"Juice boxes were the best and I have never in my life gotten a full size candy bar
My friend though loves Halloween and she spent like $100 on candy getting a stack of those super big Hershey's bars (not the regular ones you get at a gas station but the like 2 lb ones). I helped hand them out and kids literally sprinted to their parents with it waving it cause it's too big too fit in those little plastic pumpkins they were so excited"

46437,"you know what is fucked up? I dont think I ever got an amazing treat. Not even a full sized candy bar. No mythical cans of soda. Back in my day... anything chocolate was the best candy to get. Like those small fun-size candy bars. The worst was those damned mary janes candy and hard candy (cheap assholes who bought hard candy to give out).

But I DID get raisins (fuck you people who give out god damned raisins on candy night!... FUCK YOU TO HELL!)"

46441,"When I was younger I remember going to one house where nobody wanted to go. To describe it imagine your stereotypical haunted house. That is what it looked like, so little kids would not want to go there. Well me and my friends passed it and I was dared to go up there by myself. Well not wanting to be a bitch about it I went up there and knocked on the door. An old man answers the door and even before I could say Trick or Treat he had grabbed me and raped me. I got AIDS for Halloween."

46447,"Oh man, I used to love getting fun dip, caramel apple pops, reese's cups, 100 grand, swedish fish, sour punch twists, and warheads. 

Not too much I don't like but if I had to pick it would be plain m&m's, black licorice, and 3 musketeers. I'll usually just use the chocolate I don't love by chopping them up and adding it to some cookie dough."

46489,"Also near Cleveland, also have never seen a Mars bar."
46490,"From cleveland, go to college in a different part of ohio, still have never seen a single person eat a Mars bar. I had the same thought about people googling it to find out what it is"
46491,I was coming to say that. I've lived here for close to 20 years and NEVER seen a Mars bar. Our grocery stores around here dont even carry them. Where is all the Mars bar Googling coming from?
46492,Probably from the people who can't find them in the store
46493,Yep live in eastern PA and have never seen/bought/eaten/been given one of these! What the heck are they?! Haha. This is definitely not accurate to real life!
46494,"Western PA here. Can throw a stone over the border.

Never seen Mars on Halloween before either."
46495,I’m 21 years old from Pittsburgh and have never seen a mars bar. Not even in stores.

I call BS"
46498,Western PA here. Also never saw a mars bar in my entire Halloween career
46499,"Western PA checking in, it isn’t us.

Maybe it’s those weirdos up on the the glorified file tab they call Erie."
46500,"I think you may have cracked it, they've been shipping in contraband Mars products from the Canadians. I'll inform the higher-ups at Hershey immediately."
46501,"I’m from western PA, I had to google what a mars bar is.  I have for sure never gotten them at halloween.  I just asked my husband if he has ever had one and he said no, he doesn’t even know what the package looks like, so I think this map is wrong.

Editing to say I just searched it so maybe that’s why it’s number one in PA because everyone has to google it lol"
46502,I lived in northeast Ohio 34 years and not once did I hear someone ask for a Mars bar. B.S.
46503,"Yeah, something is definitely off about Ohio and PA. I've never seen a Mars Bar in person, don't know what's in one, and can't recall seeing them in stores as a halloween mix option."
46504,"I leave in North East PA and I frequent many stores /gas stations, not once have I seen a MARS bar, and thought it was just foreign and/or more popular in other states. During my childhood I have never received a MARS bar at Halloween.

 Seems like the general consensus is many people in PA have not had Mars bars. I think the real result is most likely M&Ms or Reeses"
46505,I didn't even think they made Mars bars anymore. I thought they were bought out and turned into Snickers Almond.
46506,I’m FROM Ohio and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a mars bar in my life. Definitely never received one trick or treating.
46507,It’s like one of the most popular chocolate bars ever why would they stop making it? When you buy a variety pack from Costco the mars are packaged in their own plastic bag because they are made at a separate clean facility away from snickers and m&ms so they can be deemed peanut free
46508,Where is TWIX??????????
46509,Its the only candy with the cookie crunch!
46510,You sure there’s no nougat?
46511,Seriously.

46521,I’m from MN and all we do is eat snickers and tater tot hot dish.

46523,"Texan here. I love Snickers, but it's hot here, so M&Ms are good enough. In case Mars Corp is watching, I think they should make a Snickers M&M...a comprehensive candy that won't melt all over your hands while you're trying to eat it."
46524,Open the wrapper like a banana and your hand never needs to touch it.
46525,"I do that when I need to...often when it's melting, means the caramel is squeezing all over the inside too, leaving caramel strings all over my face. Not the most dignified look. But if I'm eating a Snickers and expecting to look dignified, I need to eat a snack and rethink my priorities."
46526,All over your hands? If your using your knife and fork you should be fine.
46527,">but it's hot here, so M&Ms are good enough.

That is also the reason why they were ~~copied from smarties~~ created  in the first place, so they wouldn't melt in the hands of soldiers in WWII in the tropical climates.The US army was the first client"

46529,Just use a knife and fork! 😂
46530,Jolly Ranchers in IL? I don't believe there's that many people that enjoy sucking on a rectangle for 3 hours. If you attempt to speed up the process: your molars explode.
