65830,Very cool.
65831,"I know it may too late at this point, but you have the kid for 18 years knowing they may go to college. It shouldn't be a surprise extra expensive at 18. It should have been something you have been saving for for 18 years. Which makes CSU's more than affordable with even conservative returns.

Edit: Not sure how saving for college is a controversial statement. Open a 529 in grandparents name at the time of child's birth and throw whatever you can afford into it. Even $100/month would be $40,000 by 18. That almost pays for an entire CSU education."
65832,"It’s tough on one hand you can save for retirement so you are not a burden on your children in old age, or you can afford to send them to college. 

But short of being super wealthy I have difficulty imagining the math for both."
65833,"It's still easier to space out the cost of college over 22 years than it is over 4 years... Even saving $100 a month from the time they are born you'd have $40,000 with a 6% average return by the time they are ready for college. That is a decent chunk of a CSU leaving you with manageable student loan debt.. if any"
65834,"> you should have been saving 

In this economy?"
65835,Yes? Not sure what kind of question that is. Especially 18 years ago. And starting now as well. 18 years it plenty of time to get through ups and downs of the economy. And it has been going up for 10 years now. So if you have a child nearing college age you would have easily made a good return saving for college.
65836,"Idk where your getting 30-40k from but as a recent graduate from a UC in arguably the highest COL area in the state that is not the cost of a UC education. 

Not hating on community college it is an awesome system that provides great opportunities to many but don't make such a big decision on an accurate data."
65837,Getting it from the UC websites themselves.
65838,"it is true, there is a ""sweet spot"" where the middle class truly get screwed with things like tuition, healthcare, etc. Income not low enough to qualify for help, not high enough to actually afford it without just taking out loans."
65839,"From my experience kinda, I got zero aid or grants and my parents couldn't cover everything so I have loans for the rest. But the loans are federal not private, the interest isn't terrible and the amount I took out is manageable I'll be out of debt by 30 on only minimum payments. 

That being said I also finished in 4 years and haven't had to differ my payments at all, I also am kind of a dirty hippie that hates capitalism so I live very frugally anyway.

Also I do know UC tuition is going up despite students best efforts, when I was a student our protest were large but extremely unorganized and the regents kind of ignored us. Also the issues with tuition go back to governor Schwarzenegger so I don't really know the full context of it all."
65840,"Real cost is not 30k-40k. The UC's have been targeting the middle class for new scholarship and financial aid programs. My parents made about 190k combined and after their contribution (10k a year or so) and financial aid I only came away about 25k in debt. 

The UC's may be an option for you children."
65841,Possibly with the 2 years at a JC and then transferring?
65842,Maybe we’ll see when they get closer.
65843,Few of them are definitely overrated.
65844,"By all your criteria, the University of Cambridge is the best public university in the world. It is consistently ranked amongst the top universities in the world by multiple independent ranking systems, and always higher than any UC campus. 

It also has over 90 Nobel prizes associated with it, which is impressive as the UC system has around four times the academic staff as Cambridge.

The university of Cambridge are involved in almost all sports imaginable, often with dozens of teams for popular sports. The top echelons can hire out international sports stadiums to play and is broadcast on TV, something no other UK university other than Oxford does. In this respect it matches the US universities.

Cambridge runs a collegiate system, and is a public school, so it is possible to get the best."
65845,"I wasn't aware that Cambridge was a public school. I don't think it counts because a singular university is not a system. 

Do you have any more information on the public status of Cambridge?"
65846,"The concept of a university system is a bit foreign. Here the entirety of the country's universities bar four or five are all in the same system, organised by a central body but independently ran. In that sense the system would be ALL UK universities, including Imperial, Oxford, UCL, LSE etc.

The term ""public"" has a slightly different meaning here too. The government regulate the universities and their fees etc., but the universities aren't part of the government's assets and the lecturers are private workers.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university#United_Kingdom"
65847,"&#8710;

Ah, it seems like you get this on a technicality. It seems like pretty much all of the universities in the UK are public even if they are organized completely differently than they are here. England has too many good schools for one state system to compete."

65849,"Nice try, UC recruiter, trying to sell out of towners on UC schools and pay out-of-state tuition.  Sweet, sweet out-of-state tuition."
65850,"Out of state tuition here does suck, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming here from out of state. That being said out of state tuition is on par with the cost of a private school, and the UCs are better than all but the best private schools."
65851,"UCLA and Cal are .

Your still paying 50k a year ..."
65852,Six of the campuses are in the top 100 in the world. That counts as out ranking all but the best.
65853,"The only UC's that are ""better than all but the best private schools"" are UC Berkeley and UCLA. The others are fairly average in terms of public college respectability. Those are the only two schools in the UC school system that really contend with the other top schools in the country."
65854,Even UC Davis is ranked higher than the flagship universities in other states.
65855,"As a Californian who just went through the college selection process I do not argue on the academics portion. But I do disagree on two things

First they are just expensive as private schools. They are terrible at financial aid. Going through the process I decided to go out of state to a different school because they would give me financial aid and it is considerably cheaper.

Secondly the major UCs like cal, ucla, ucsd, ucsb are no longer helping the students of California. What I mean by that is that they are consistently taking out of staters with the same grades or worse rather than instaters solely because of money. I would want to see the UCs be more like North Carolina chapel hill. Where it sets a higher bar for out of state students to get in."
65856,What? Setting the bar higher for out of state residents makes 0 logical sense. If the problem is the admissions and the money then the way admissions work should be changed. It's corruption. You fix corruption by changing the core problem. Not something associated with it
65857,Well it is a public institution it should try and serve the residents of that state who pay taxes to help the university first before those who are out of state.
65858,Which it does by giving them subsidized tuition and availability to more scholarships
65859,Barely it is still extremely expensive and the top universities in the state are choosing out of state students over money
65860,How do you know?
65861,"http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_25731300/uc-nonresident-students-increase-californians-admissions-slow

This has been a common criticism of UC for the last few years. They are enrolling more out of staters to help with finances."
65862,Ahh okay. I guess public state universities should prioritize instate! Thanks for changing my mind. Maybe there should be requirements for how many are admitted for instate and out of state.
65863,I think they have 20% of the incoming class as out of state.
65864,Is that a trend or an actual requirement?
65865,"It's the BIGGEST, does not make it best."
65866,It has the best ranked schools. No other public system compares.
65867,"Virginia has #3 and #6 #25 and #72 ranked schools, and it has population that is 5 times smaller than California. So it has more top schools *per capita*.

Realistically, this means that these to schools are a lot more accessible to average Virginian than to average Californian."
65868,"This CMW wasn't about per capita. The UC system has more higher ranked schools, and is better overall than the UV system."
65869,"Let's say there are two towns

Town A has budget of 100 million and 100 residents.

Town B has budget of 200 milion.and 10000 residents.

Which town has better economy? 

Per capita is of PARAMONT important.

 What good is having more good schools if they are inaccessible to most of the population? 

Virginia has good schools available to a much.higher percentage of citizens - -so.Virginia's system is better."
65870,"What schools are even in the University of Virginia system? 

edit: I found a list. http://www.schev.edu/students/publications/public4year.pdf

It seems like Virginia has a different organization of tertiary education than California. California has the UC system for research universities, state universities for the education of the bulk of the workforce, and community colleges. Virginia's system might be more accessible solely because it is set up to be. The UC system isn't, and is made for the top 12.5% of CA graduates."
65871,"U of Virginia(#2 in the nation!), William and Mary, Virginia tech.

All top pubic schools:

http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public"
65872,"I think the overall combination of more highly ranked schools, more Nobel prizes, and better athletics stills gives the edge to the University of California. I guess this will be determined when UCLA meets UVA this fall :p"
65873,"Again, you can't discount the population disparity.

California would need FIVE schools like uva and FIFTEEN schools like uva, w&m and Virginia tech for it to be comparable.

Virginia simply has better system for the population it serves."
65874,"Instead of comparing populations it would be more wise to compare the number of aspiring college students. There are many socioeconomic differences between VA and CA. 

I'm still not convinced on the accessibility argument because the systems have different objectives. If the CSU system didn't exist the UC system would be much much larger."
65875,So university is free in California?
65876,"No, but in state tuition is subsidized."
65877,"The University of California is also the most welcoming to war criminals.

John Yoo wrote the ""torture memos"" declaring torture to be just peachy keen and perfectly legal.  He also gave the OK for indefinite detention of enemy combatants.

He's now a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.

Yoo also authored the October 23, 2001 memo asserting that the President had sufficient power to allow the NSA to monitor the communications of US citizens on US soil without a warrant (known as the warrantless wiretap program) because the Fourth Amendment does not apply. Or, as another memo says in a footnote, ""Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations."" 

([citations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yoo#Regarding_torture_of_detainees))

In case you're wandering what law students at UC are learning....."
65878,"Well you're out of state so you'll pay a lot more. USC definitely costs the most along with Stanford but that's because they are private universities. 

I went to UCLA and I can say, it opened a lot of doors for me. TBH with you both Berkeley and UCLA are considered public ivys so you wouldn't have a problem with alumni networks getting out of school.

The CSU's don't have as good a reputation but they're more cost effective. If you had the choice, definitely UC over CSU.

As for Stanford and USC they speak for themselves. USC, hard for me to admit has an incredible alumni network all over the country. And Stanford, well I don't need to say anything about Stanford.

Note UCLA and Berkeley get a TON of applications so hopefully you're a well rounded student. It's not enough anymore to get just good grades, you have to have extracurriculars, great SAT scores and like a great personal statement.

Either way you choose to go to school at the UCs you get the prestige but it'll cost you a pretty penny."
65879,Well i'm actually going as a grad student. 3.6 GPA undergrad but haven't taken the GRE yet.
65880,"You should know that the above post isn't 100% correct. I'm currently looking into MBA and UCLA business is actually more expensive than USC, even for in-state students, but it really isn't by much (~$125k vs ~$115k). If you care about rankings and want an alumni network that will work for you then your only options are Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA or USC. You can't really go wrong with any of those. If you just want a business degree to say you have a business degree, I would go to a CSU instead of any other UC.

edit: Just want to say I am not making a dig at the CSU. I went to a CSU for undergrad and it was awesome and opened up a lot of opportunities, but if you are looking to go to a top company, your chances will be much, much higher at Berkeley, UCLA, USC and Stanford."
65881,"Yeah the UC grad degrees were surprisingly high cost. Even Davis is 60k for MBA students thanks to the ""professional degree"" fee. What a joke."
65882,"Yepp. FWIW, I also went to USC for engineering grad school and had a great time. The Trojan Network is definitely awesome. Personally, I'm leaning towards UCLA for business school since I already have the USC network and because it's impossible to get into Stanford or Berkeley. XD"
65883,"Yeah I didn't realize he was an MBA, thought he was an undergrad hence the SAT statement. But yes post grad is much more expensive."
65884,"It's insane TBH. 18k for undergrad at Berkeley, but 70k for MBA/MSFE regardless of residency."
65885,"Just a note, all the UCs are considered Public Ivy except Merced I think."
65886,"Good point, UCR has a MSF and it's a viable option. But i've heard that one isn't even close to even Davis or Santa Cruz."
65887,"Honestly, public schools are great and all. I'm a UC graduate. But going to a private school for graduate programs can very often help you advance your career unlike at a public school. There are just so many resources available to you that come with the high tuition, and having the USC name alone on your resume is a plus."
65888,"The experience of one CSU to another can be wildly different, like Dominguez Hills and San Diego State. I graduated from a CSU, and some of my classmates did get jobs on the east coast - the key difference is they had internships locally with the Big 4. Everyone seems to respect a CSU degree here, especially when it's from a local CSU. UC is the same way.... UCLA is a lot more impressive than UC Riverside or UC Merced.  My sister went to USC, seemed to open up a lot of doors for her because of all the connections she made there."
65889,"Yeah good point. ""good students"" are ""good students"" whether they're at UCLA or Fullerton and end of the day, those internships matter quite a bit if they're successful. As a grad student though with already 50k in debt i get the value of USC (I'm a big believer in the power of networking). The amazing thing is how comparable the prices are for graduate studies at the UC schools vs the big private ones, it's a little depressing. Like UCSD is ~60k for the year program and USC is close to that."
65890,Stanford's and USC's networking is well-known and works well. UCLA (I'm a grad) is trying to get get better with the networking opportunities.
65891,"the reputation of a California university on the east coast is an interesting topic, never really thought about it. The companies I've been at (northern and southern cal) don't seem to have a problem with hiring east coast graduates. If you need to know anything specifically about Fullerton, just shoot me a PM."
65892,"Can't say for sure how Cal State degrees fare in the east, but I do see a trend where pedigree is becoming less of an issue due to an oversupply of people with graduate degrees.
  
What I would suggest is that you stalk the companies where you think you might get hired and look at key players in that company and see where they hold degrees. If you see a particular concentration, you might be better served getting your degree from a college in that range.

While it may not be the best option for everyone, you can do the degree online and maybe even save money. Most major universities have online business/MBA degrees. Check out this list:  
  
http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/mba"
65893,"If you're considering an MBA, take a look at Loyola Marymount University. They have a top notch MBA program that collaborates with the Silicon Beach which is literally steps away from campus. It's also in a great location."
65894,"An MBA at USC will cost you about $180k, but the social connections and job opportunity is unmatched. You are going to find employment paying over $120k but likely to be closer to $200k.
The UC and CSU systems are very different but depending on your needs, you may just need CSU. I.e. if you're going to work in HR for a state sponsored institution, the CSU will suffice and you will make over $110k."
65895,"Luckily their MSF program is only 1 year which is what i'm really targeting. Well worth the 1 year of tuition costs if I can get some aid and commute from my family's place in NoHo (sounds simple to me, probably insane to a native).

Edit: i'm looking for finance jobs"
65896,"Yikes, what happened to UCSC?!"
65897,"they waitlisted me, that’s why /s"
65898,why is ucsc behind ucr and ucm
65899,is UCSC really that bad? kinda want to go to the school cause of the foresty vibe/campus lol
65900,US News *obviously* forgot to move the 0 for Davis to make them 1st place for public and 0.38th for overall rank 🙄🙄
65901,"Here's also the admit data that I posted a few days ago. It's interesting how it compares with the rankings.

Based on my early “research” lol from UCLA freshman profile, 4.15 Capped is roughly equal to 4.3 fully weighted and 4.3 Capped is roughly 4.65 fully weighted."
65903,where is uc hicago
65904,It's bizarre that US News consistently thinks there are almost 20 private schools better than the number one public school. It exposes something broken about their methodology.
65905,"Does it, though? These public universities have incredible prestige as aggregate institutions, but they result in really large class sizes for most undergrads. There are instances of people needing five years to graduate because they can’t get the classes they want. The research output is of course phenomenal, but I’m not sure that translates to college. Keep in mind this is the undergrad ranking. UCB is almost always among the global T20 universities and sometimes T10, of which it’s quite deserving."
65906,At least some of the schools don’t belong above Berkeley and UCLA. Notre Dame doesn’t deserve it.
65907,"I, too, like to clown on Notre Dame tbh"
65908,"And then Stanford, USC, Pomona, etc. are those richass kids who go to Harker"
65909,"Stanford = Menlo nerds (they're literally down the street),

Pepperdine = those richass kids who go to Harker who got too drunk in high school a lot and their parents think they'd be safer here (a dry campus),
Harvey Mudd = those kids from Arcadia who couldn't get into CalTech,
Claremont McKenna = Sage Hill kids who were too good for USC,
Pitzer = they're probably from rural california or sacramento,
Pomona = i dIDnT wAnT tO Go tO aN IvY, tHeY'Re oVErRaTeD,

What in the world are you talking about?

The grad strikes only completely closed campus for a handful of days total, something that is not at all uncommon at UCSC. Only 20% of grades were late."
65958,"Literally every quarter before COVID there would be 1-2 strikes at least.

https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/california-residents/statewide-guarantee/"
65979,Based
65980,Out-of-state and out-of-country students subsidize the in-state students because the State Legislature refuses to grant the UCs more money or allow for tuition hikes.
65981,"I’m aware if this. Hence my discontent, it’s a problem that adversely affects in state low income students"
65982,"Uh, no? Literally the opposite. If out-of-state students were removed, in-state low-income students would suffer the most."
65983,"Don't really know where you are getting this from, I would say I was maybe in the top 35% of students for my graduating year and still got into a UC for Organic Chemistry. Out of state students are maybe like 30% and are all wonderful people"
65984,"…….where to begin…….and the students adversely affected by said policy, also wonderful people"
65985,I ask this sincerely as a Cal grad: is there a source for this? I’d like to learn more
65986,"Merced above Santa Cruz!?! While I'm sad for the Banana Slugs, in a way I'm relieved to see the UC system's big investment in Merced paying off. That said, let's all take USNWR with a grain of salt. It's just one of many rankings. Forbes just put Berkeley #1 overall. Go Bears! (https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/)"
65987,As a banana slug I am le sad lol
65988,Probably because of high weighing on social mobility. Merced has a relatively poor student body
65989,Not to mention Merced is super small I think compared to Santa Cruz enrollment.
65990,"Forbes also said that UC Davis was better than UChicago, CalTech, Johns Hopkins and Brown.

Forbes is not a reliable metric to find the ""best"" schools. It's a niche ranking looking for the most ""bang for your buck"" school. It's pretty good for the latter."
65991,"Forbes puts more emphasis on things like cost of attendance and socio-economic mobility. I believe it's intended to be moreso comparing the ""return on investment"" rather than pure prestige."
65992,"It's a reliable metric if by ""best"" you mean ""most bang for your buck."" All of the top-ranked Forbes schools are still elite, after all; it's just a slightly different weighting of criteria."
65993,What does Forbes have to do with anything?
65994,Looks like Berkeley slipped down to 2 behind UCLA.
65995,"And yet Berkeley is #4 in their best global universities list and UCLA is #13 

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings"
65996,"Different sets of metrics. Undergrad prioritizes things like # of applicants, which UCLA wins on."
65997,Number of applicants being criteria for a ranking sounds like a very self fulfilling prophecy
65998,"Oh, I find the USNWR ratings to be one of the worst things about the whole college industry (disclosure, went to Cal awhile back)"
65999,"The national universities ranking is the ""main"" ranking that people commonly follow. Both rankings are made-up and kinda useless, but just wanted to put this out there."
66000,Global universities list has to do with research output. National Universities list has to do with undergrad metrics. The latter is the original list and generally is cited much more.
66001,It’s almost as though these rankings are meaningless and arbitrary…
66002,UCB has been ranked below UCLA for 4 years now.
66003,Careful.  They get hurt when you call them UC Berkeley and not The University of California.
66004,"""Cal""

That's what they call it."
66005,"As it should!!



Bruins all day!!"
66006,My banana slugs seem to be trending in the wrong direction. 😞
66007,Santa Barbara is now a better school than San Diego? Interesting. I always viewed UCSD as having a solid grip on their 3rd place in the UC rankings.
66008,Very weird to see. SB was seen as a party school when I was applying to college 10 years ago. I was near the top of my class and barely got into SD.
66009,"Shoutout to UC Irvine Department of Continuing Studies, a distance learner from Canada"
66010,Wow!  UC Davis and UT Austin tied at #38.
66011,"Great to see as a UCLA alum.  I got into Berkeley also but I didn't like the vibe as much. Also their admissions rep really put me off by answering most of the questions by saying ""a degree from Berkeley is worth its weight in gold."" 

Ok

And good job with UCI for climbing up and consistently showing itself to be the other dominant university in the LA/OC area."
66012,"> ""a degree from Berkeley is worth its weight in gold.""

Well heavy cardstock is around 300 grams per square meter. The standard 8.5 x 11 diploma is around 0.06 m^2. That gives around 18g. Gold is around $60/g for a total a $1080.

So not that impressive of a statement really."
66013,Back in the late 90s gold was much cheaper at \~$270 an ounce.  With your math it's about $171 or $280 in today's money.
66014,"Just FYI, it’s *its weight in gold* (no apostrophe)."
66015,"> Just FYI, it’s its weight in gold (no apostrophe).

That's the kind of thing you don't learn when you settle for UCLA.

(I'm only teasing - I didn't get accepted to UCLA or even apply to Berkeley.)"
66017,I went to UCSB in the early 2000s and now wouldn't have a shot at getting in.  Crazy.
66018,"Same! I remember hearing more and more about the accolades and Pulitzer Prizes a few faculty were pulling in, but I didn’t feel like I was getting *that* level of prestige education.

On the other hand, I learned the value of critical thinking and found my career during those four years, while studying hard and enjoying the benefits of IV. We attended during a sweet time, I think."
66019,"Living in IV while going to UCSB is a valuable lesson in “Work Hard, Play Hard”. And also how to split freebirds with 4 people."
66020,Amen. I miss Freebirds ❤️
66021,"Excerpt: 

> Six University of California campuses rank among the top 10 public universities in the country, with all nine UC undergraduate campuses among the top 50 in the 2022 Best Colleges rankings, published today (Sept. 13) by U.S. News & World Report.

> UC also ranked highly in the national university rankings, with eight campuses among the nation’s top 100 schools, public or private."
66022,Are there any ranking systems based on research impact alone?
66023,"UC schools have historically been for high school graduates with a higher GPA/academic performance while CalState is for the rest. That's a generalization, but the competitiveness/comparison in admission rate btwn the 2 school systems reflects the reality.

My friends compared as we either came from UC or CalState, and the consensus was that UC has more academic/research in nature, while CalState has more practical course work."
66024,"The systems when originally organized in the 1960s were basically designed so UCs would take the top 10% of students, CSU would take the next 30% and CCC would take everyone else with pathways through each to the next level as steps if you have difficulty at points in your life to climb back up.

It's an incredibly good system that makes things clear for students and helps people reach their highest education level they can without massive gaps."
66025,Lots of employers I know prefer grads from CSU over UC for that reason.
66026,"And this compared to our local schools which are supposed to be supplemented (before Prop 13 it was primarily funded) with local funding.

Too bad they have been severely hampered because their primary source of local funds, property taxes, do not even keep pace with inflation. Decades later local funding has shrunk so much all that's left now is state and federal life support.

Prop 13 is insidious."
66027,Thanks Reagan
66028,"Prop 13 was a voter led ballot initiative with huge support at the time. 

I’m sure somehow you can blame Reagan but as of now we have supermajority of Democrats in the state senate and state assembly who I wish would do anything within their power to loosen the effects of it."
66029,Property taxes are political cyanide in California
66030,So a $120+ billion for K-12 isn't enough despite enrollment shrinking by 1% a year since 2013? It shrunk 2% last year. Look at where the money is going because there's a hell of a lot of it out there.
66031,"On a per capita basis? Yes. It's not enough.

66032,"* University of California Berkeley, a public school, is about $160k for four years tuition + living on campus, for in-state California residents. Tuition is $14,254/year at 2021-2022 rate, or $57,008 4-year if you can keep cost of living down by living at home**

  * https://admissions.berkeley.edu/cost

* San Jose State University, a public school, is about $120k for four years tuition + estimated cost of living (9 months/year), for in-state California residents. Tuition is $7,852.00/year at 2019-2020 rate, or $31,408 4-year tuition if you can keep costs of living down by living at home**

  * https://www.sjsu.edu/faso/docs/net-price-calculator.html

Even if you do community college for 2 to 3 years, and then 2 years to complete your Bachelors, it is going to be about $60k to $80k total cost, or about $15,704 to $28,504 for only tuition.

**Someone's gotta pay, so having parents with a stable income/home is a great benefit here. Also doesn't cover books, computers, gas/car, etc."
66033,"That's where I'm at. AA-T from a CCC and I'm applying to a few CalStates this fall.

FYI, if you exclude living costs... CCC is pretty much 100% paid for for many CA residents. California Promise Grant is pretty huge with wiping away tuition."
66034,"I first went to Chico (hated it, my entire high school practically went there and everything was greek) so I transferred to Long Beach and absolutely looooved it. So take advantage of the transfer system if you find one campus just doesn’t feel right for you. :)"
66035,"as someone who started freshman year at Cal Poly, I despise having so much major coursework done and still missing GEs to be untranserrable until I take a few semesters of CC"
66036,"I’m looking at Long Beach and Fullerton (those are the two closest to me with the best art programs) Los Angeles is a 3rd option. My transfer counselor says that if I strike out (for some reason), Dominguez Hills is pretty desperate for transfers and I can finish up my bachelors there."
66037,"It’s a good plan. I distinctly remember walking by the art building on my way to comm and theater every day and being so immensely jealous of the program. I worked so much there wasn’t a way for me to justify an extra art lab time in my day’s schedule and I had to literally walk by the classes outside on the green. Siiiigh. 

I wish you you luck. :)"
66038,Thanks! I hope I get in.
66039,"I am a student a csuf and I took a class over at Dominguez hills. And while that particular professor over there was fantastic, I just wanna say that overall its not as nice as csuf or csulb. The buildings are old and the campus is really small, plus the surrounding area is more industrial. Csuf and csulb have a nicer feel to them with LB being close to the beach. 

I don't know anything about their art program, so it might be great. Good luck on whatever choice you make!"
66040,Thanks for the heads up. My number one choice is Fullerton.
66041,deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4140  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/90948)
66042,Thankfully I think all UCs have the blue and gold opportunity program! It's a great thing and I wouldn't be able to afford college if it didn't exist
66043,My son is working while going to CC and at his current pay will probably make enough to pay for a couple years of CSU. He has a college fund  but plans to have that for grad school or his first house. CSU is really pretty reasonable.
66044,"Even with my parents making over 6 figures combined, my tuition is still a burden. I thought FAFSA would be a life saver, but at their income, it is a joke."
66045,Those generous UC pensions aren't going to pay for themselves.
66046,"This is unrelated to the post, but Harvard should not be in the top ten. Honestly, Harvard produces the worst people imaginable. People hell bent on destroying democracy. People like Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, and the lying Kayleigh McEnany. So many awful people who don't know right from wrong. 

Harvard should forever be known as a terrible institution that produces the worst people in our society."
66047,Bad people come through every institution.  There's nothing special about Harvard in that respect.
66048,"The horrible people that attend lowly state schools don’t obtain the resources or connections to spread their awful and self-interested ideas. Besides, schools like Harvard overwhelmingly cater to the richest and most powerful of our country, it’s not like it’s a representative sample of our population. And it’s no surprise when children of multi-millionaires make careers out of keeping and expanding their wealth at the expense of so many others."
66049,">The horrible people that attend lowly state schools don’t obtain the resources or connections to spread their awful and self-interested ideas.

You mean like Ed Meese and Michael Milken?"
66050,"Always getting caught on the needlessly absolute statements lol.

Elite schools cater to the socio-political elites, if for no other reason that for those institutions’ formative years and for most of the time since those are the only people who could realistically attend. It’s ingrained. These people tend to be “conservative” (in the “lower taxes for the wealthy, get government contracts for my family’s industry” sort of way) out of self-interest. Harvard, the Ivy League in general, and similar schools produce these people out of both their culture and likely due to simple inertia.

Even highly respected schools with less entrenched history like UC Berkeley, UCLA, Michigan, Virginia, etc. aren’t quite at the same level of educating the political elite. Not sure how or if we should punish elite schools for this, but there’s a reason so many political elite attend or send their kids to Harvard or Yale."
66051,"To counter your point, how many good people have come out of Harvard? I think a better way to put it is that the social elite go to Harvard, which gives them access to more positions of power, and more exposure to those already in power. If a bad person goes through that process, well now we have a bad player in a good position. Remember the old saying “it’s not what you know, but who you know” to an extent obviously.

Quick edit: I do agree on your opinion of those people though"
66052,"How could you forget Mark Zuckerberg. But at the same time Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Obama, so I think it's a complex issue."
66053,It also produced the lady who saved the Afghan Girls' Robotics Team. They produce all sorts.
66054,It appears that lady isn’t really the “white savior” she says she is. https://www.insider.com/lawyer-girls-afghan-robotics-team-oklahoma-woman-overstated-role-escape-2021-8
66055,"Good people can come out of bad institutions. 

But the institution that produces all of the criminals from the Trump administration should be shunned from society. Do they not have like a mandatory ethics class at Harvard? Harvard is just a rich, white old-boys club that has to let minorites in for perception and to get federal grants."
66056,This applies to all Ivys
66057,I could make a similar comment about every single UC school. Grow up and smell the reality.
66058,Enjoying my first semester at Berkeley. Looks like I made a good choice! I love it here too.

66060,Dropped out of a UC to go to a CSU. Don't regret it.
66061,Why the switch?
66062,"Mostly the department I was in and I had no chance to transfer to other majors that I genuinely wanted.

I was majoring in Stats and Data Science and the department is ran rather horribly.

UCSB has an exceptional Physics program, though, and I am glad that I took some classes with them :) but I wanted to do CompSci and I will happily do that at CSUCI."
66063,"That’s great. How’s the CS programs at CSUCI (and CSU in general, if you know)? I’ve always been interested in doing college recruiting at CSU"
66064,"Fantastic. One drawback is that it doesn't have name recognition or whatever, but the clases are great and they really do try to advertise job opportunities. Lots of student eventually find employment locally. Hopefully I can too '.'"
66065,socal or norcal? i’m looking at staying csu or transferring since i’m transferring anyway
66066,People still read that
66067,I know this should be a good thing though having any public institutions that are supported by tax payers and are unaffordable to most Californians is just gross.
66068,"Tuition and living expenses might look high, but when you factor in grants (Pell, Cal Grants, etc), scholarships (UC Regents, Chancellors, + thousands of various campus and non-campus scholarships), work study, and federal students loans, the system is one of the most affordable in the nation... that's not even factoring in the high average mid-career salaries that graduates make."
66069,"I’m really not sure I understand why “the system” should require everything you listed for average Californians to be able to afford to send their children to a school funded by their tax dollars? 

Shouldn’t California universities serve Californians?"
66071,"If you can't spend a couple of hours to learn about or talk to a counselor about financial aid.. maybe ...  just maybe... the UC system isn't for you. The schools are beholden to different interests that give money to students for different reasons... don't blame the UC system, or the CSU system for that matter, blame the lack of interest most voters have in adequately funding higher education. Voters said no to the last ballot item about increasing funding for the three California systems of higher education."
66072,I’m at a loss as to why it’s okay to make  Californians jump through extra hoops to get an education though a publicly funded entity.
66073,I am at a loss for why you are at a loss for why students have to do extra work for free money. Literally the easiest money they'll ever get. There is also the CSU system. It's even more affordable.
66074,I'm at a loss...as to why there is as system where education from public institutions is not affordable.
66075,Because the voters decided to elect politicians that decided not to fund the system.
66076,$14k annual tuition is amazingly cheap for globally-recognized schools. That's what I paid to go to a comparable public university (in a different state) ten years ago. What you're really upset at is the cost of housing.
66077,"No, I’m upset at the cost of education being 50k at a public institution and people thinking that’s okay for a public institute to charge that much to get a quality, public, education."
66078,plenty of affordable options out there... just not the schools that everyone else wants to get to unless you're la creme de la creme
66079,Boo! UCLA finish 1st in public universities and my alma mater Cal 2nd.  I demand an audit.

66105,Did you forget UCSF? I dunno if there'd be a lot of redditors from there who aren't more interested in another subreddit though.
66106,"I don't know how I missed that one. 

There are roughly 3,000 students there, so I think that would be a good college for a reddit to cover issues of concern for students, faculty, alumni and prospective students. 

Keep in mind you can be subscribed up to 50 reddits (actually, you can be subscribed to many more than that, but reddit only displays 50 reddits at a time randomly selected from the ones that you are subscribed to).

Would you be interested in being a moderator?"
66107,"For what, a new /r/UCSF? Sure, but I don't actually go there and never have. I worked in a lab there for 2 summers, as did several of my friends. 'Course, if you just want someone to moderate spam I can do that, sure."
66108,"San Francisco Art Instutute (sfai.edu -- not to be confused with the for-profit Art Institute of California, SF above)"
66109,"Do you want to start a reddit for the college?

There is [a contest going on for creating and growing college reddits](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html)."
66110,"I'm a 2004 alum who lives 2.5 hrs away, probably not the best candidate."
66111,DVC now is at r/DVC!!    Yeah.
66113,[/r/ssu/](/r/ssu/) has been around for 7 months.
66114,"aw man, I could start a St Mary's subreddit but I already graduated and the only people that knew about reddit there were CaTS (our school's ITS) student workers. Might be a lost cause :T"
66115,You should start one anyway and try to recruit some current students to help you moderate the reddit.
66116,"Do you have to be a student at the college?  I'm a full time employee, I run a department and would love to get more of our students on Reddit... or get them out of the closet."
66117,Make the subreddit and spread it! There aren't any laws about that sort of thing.
66118,"Anyone can create a reddit. 

Having an employee as one of the mods for a college reddit may be a very good thing because they won't be as transitory as students. Besides, a college reddit should be for students, alumni, prospective students, professors, employees, members of the nearby community that are interested in the college, etc."
66119,"If you do create a reddit for your college, please let me know."
66120,I go to CCA (California College of the Arts) but I don't think there is a big enough audience to create a subreddit for it... apparently us art schoolers are too busy for redditing.
66121,I once saw a guy give a crit while reading reddit at the same time. It was kind of depressing actually...
66122,"You should create one anyway. If you are on reddit, there are probably more of your fellow students also on reddit.

...and we could use some art students to help create [/r/redditlogos](/r/redditlogos), etc."
66123,"I was expecting Art Center to have one, I guess they're too busy lol.
Wait so then Academy of Art University has one then?"
66124,"Here is the [list of California reddits](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/california). As far as I can tell, neither the Art Center nor the Academy of Art University has a reddit currently."
66126,"[/r/usfca/](/r/usfca/), a community for 4 days that already has 21 members."
66128,I see it now that it has 22 members.
66129,No love for a City College of San Francisco subreddit? For shame.
66130,"I'm shameless. ;)

I didn't list any junior colleges. There are 112 of them, but currently there are [only three reddits for junior colleges in California](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/california#Juniorcolleges). There is [/r/CaliforniaCommunityColleges](/r/calcommunitycolleges) for issues related to all California Community Colleges.

On the other hand, there is nothing from stopping you from creating one. Would you be interested in being a mod for a reddit for City College of San Francisco?"
66131,"I'm no longer enrolled at CCSF but if no one else steps up to be a moderator, I'll do it."
66132,"College reddits should be for students, administrators and instructors, prospective students, alumni, and community members interested in the college. Since community college students are only there for a short while, it's harder for them to create and develop a reddit community. 

Go ahead and create a reddit for CCSF and see what happens."
66133,Bayern are on another level they are incredible to watch.
66134,PSG and that’s it. No comment
66135,Bayern won the club World Cup
66136,Confused Lingard doesn’t play for any of these teams
66137,"Porto, because they have Jesus."
66138,If City get Bayern in the next round of CL we might find out!
66139,"Bayern, they have unshaken performance, which is unbelievably good"
66140,"I think so. Obviously they aren't as invincible as they were last year, losing 5-1 in the league. But with Flick and their elite squad I think they'll dominante the UCL again."
66141,"It's a common question on /r/soccer 

The answers seem to be split between AC Milan 1988-94 who got to five European Cup/Champions League finals in seven seasons (winning three) and took the Italian league title five times in that spell (88-96 to be precise) too. They were the last team to retain the title of European club champions. 


Barcelona 2009-2012 are up there.  I guess the jury are still out on what their ""era"" will be, in years to come it may extend to the teams which Xavi, Iniesta and Messi were the heartbeat of.  They won the Champions League in 2006 with a lot of the players who won it in 2009 and they might win it again in the next year or two, but the Pep Guardiola team were **so** good that they even stand out from the guys who bookended it. 

As an Englishman I'm compelled to add the great Liverpool team of the mid seventies through to the mid/late eighties.  They won four European cups (Champions League these days) two UEFA cups, three FA cups and ten league titles.  It was utter dominance and really the reason why Liverpool are still considered to be one of **the** great football clubs of our time. 

I guess you could argue for Real Madrid of the late 50s and the Ajax and Bayern Munich sides of the early to mid 1970s. I have to confess ignorance on those teams, before my time and on the other side of Europe from where I live.   I can't comment on the great South American teams but their club sides always seem to lose their best players to Europe, the very best teams to come from South America always seem to be national sides."
66142,Pele's Santos was also pretty unstoppable
