27541,You might select old actors and movies too....
27542,"I'd prefer QSQT instead of 3 idiots,   
Namesake should have found a place in Irrfan's"
27543,Not a fan of QSQT. Love Namesake though but I cant replace any of the films on my list for it.
27544,"Yes, someone finally recognizes Abhay Deol! I love him, he's so underrated!"
27545,Abhay is the most talented Deol..... Really want to see him more on screen!
27546,Me too! I loved him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara! I'm planning on watching Socha Na Tha and Raanjhanaa next :D
27547,"Isnt Amir a big jerk?

He has an illegitimate child who he has disowned"
27548,yep.. big time..
27549,I kinda disagree with Aamir. He comes across as petty and micromanaging. Some of the things he pushed forward in his TV show made me question his intelligence. The rest seem on point though.
27550,"According to him, nobody in the industry is a smart as him and everyone is very fake, and he’s superior to them in every aspect :)"
27551,There's always one in every classroom.
27552,"And on what basis you say this, can you point out any interview where he say this ?"
27553,"They way he talks about how different he is from other actors, the way he presents. 


Also have searched on interviews about him because he’s regarded as one of the great actors (I do believe that) but he talks about cinema, filmmaking or etc. it’s always about me me me"
27554,"Again any interview where he says that he is different from other. His movies are different and when those became successful, journalists ask how you can do such movie, and what he says that he just liked script. 

Naseerushshin shah said that no producer will put their money on movies like
Lagaan, Peepli live or even TZP when he produced those. So journalists are not wrong in asking about why he produced such movie and he can only say that he liked the script. 

Nowhere he says that he is different from others. He always accept that SRK / Salman are bigger star and they can get audience just based on their moves but he has to work hard."
27555,"The pucca directors either refuse to work with Amir or have a fallout with him eventually due to his habit of hijacking all creative aspects of making a film. Case in point: Shankar - Refused to work. RGV - Fallout after Rangeela. Amol Gupte - hijacked TZP.  
  
 That leaves him with his pet directors, who he puts on the leash on the set: Raju Hirani and Vijay Kumar Acharya."
27556,"Raju Hirani Is not pet director. Rakesh Mehra,kunal kohli , ashitosh gowarikar they are big names n have big hit films even without working with aamir. Karan Johar n shakun batra he refused coz of script.. I know ppl generally think his private life is mess but dude just look at his contributions through paani foundation it’s phenomenal. And his ex wife works on that foundation. He may have not spent a lot of time with Junaid ira but he is very close to ira..u can see kese zidd kar k shirish kunder directorial pe thumps up dilwaya for her cousin sister.relation  Junaid I’m confused coz he is very media shy but he makes it a point to go watch his theatre plays."
27557,"RGV , Naseerudhdhin Shah all had issue with working with Aamir

But all of them appreciate him, it is just heir working style doesn't. Naseerushshin Shah praises Aamir more than any other major khan.

Go see the tweet of RGV after Dangal, he accept that Aamir is working on making better movies. 

Rajkumar Hirani is not a pet director, he himself is big and they had good working experience, may be it is just that their working process matched. 

Most of the directors Aamir has worked with, their most successful movie they got is with Aamir, so most probably he has significant contributionn and inputs in the movie making."
27558,"I don't like how he stole credit for TZP. If you see the movie, it has a clear first half (focused on the kid, very sensitive and empathetic) and the second half where the hero and saviour makes an appearance. Very tonally different and it's obvious who directed what part."
27559,FYI he took over direction very early and not in second half
27560,"That's not what the director says - he says he shot for 109 days

https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/amol-gupte-lashes-out-at-amir-khan/story-u0WHsrzySB1HKzWCQ0wygK.html

It's hard to say who is telling the truth, but personally, when you see the movie you can clearly make out treatment difference between certain scenes."
27561,Why Amol's wife kept working on editing the movie then ?
27562,"Aamir is fake and hypocrite, far from intelligent. And about his personal life didn't he disown his kid? left his wife and two kids to be with an AD? AFAIK he did not share a good relation with his Dad and other relatives. His brother went to cops against him"
27563,"Although his wife and he are on good terms, she is working with Paani foundation. 

So it is not necessary that he lfet him, may be just that they decided to separate."
27564,"I legit can not stand Amir khan’s holier than thou attitude. Dude is an average actor that has limited range, so overrated IMO."
27565,"Srk:  very charming and witty. May I say he's very masculine too. Like I want SRK to protect me. Sometimes gives me narcissist vibes but that's maybe just me. Anyways, a really cool guy. 

Salman:  bully, manchild, arrogant, wants everyone to agree with him and if they don't then they're in trouble 🙄 don't know what girls find attractive about him. If I ever get involved with a guy like that, I would have run for the hills. 

Aamir:  pseudo intelligent. Comes across as pretty fake to me in his interviews. 

Akshay:  extremely street smart. Looks down on people who are not as successful as him. Intelligent too. 

Ranbir:  either he's a huge narcissist or just an extremely chill guy. There's no in between. Honestly I  think only people really close to him can actually tell how he's like because he never lets his face show his real emotions in his interviews. When I was watching bigg boss, the guy siddharth shukla reminded me of him many times but I really hope Ranbir is not like him. 

Ranveer:  genuinely intelligent and really Smart. Never let his ott behavior fool you, this guy knows his shit. Seems like a fun guy to be around. 

Varun:  humble, down to earth, truly nice person. I think he's really close to his family and the reason why he's genuinely kind is because of his upbringing. Good guy 👍

Kartik:  I have not seen his interviews but I follow him on Instagram and he comes across as a typical small town dude who is trying to make it big. Sometimes look desperate but I don't get any negative vibes from him. Overall sweet guy. 

Ayushmaan: I've been following ayushmaan's career since he used to host TV shows and may I say that success has indeed changed him. He's not a bad guy but he comes across as shallow sometimes. Or maybe he's always been like this. But he's well-read, knows Indian audience and is talented too. He has worked really hard and deserve every bit of his success. I have a soft spot for him lol."
27566,">He's not a bad guy but he comes across as shallow sometimes. Or maybe he's always been like this.

Elaborate a bit on this one please."
27567,I think he's not as nice as most people think he is. He's pretty shrewd and cunning.
27568,"Oh, I thought you had some dirt on him... I think he is careful. He is an outsider whose career can be ruined by any egoist insider. So he needs to be smart. 🤷‍♀️"
27569,I agree with you
27570,"There was a time I really liked Aamir. Can’t stand him now. ( his films I still watch )

 His personal life is far from perfect. Has had flings left right n centre while married to Reena. Had a child with a woman and disowned the kid. I also find his relationship with Ira and Junaid complicated. He does seem like a Devoted father to Azad though.

Also both him and his pseudo wife come off as hypocrites.   


I may be in the minority but I have never found SRK witty or charming. His sense of humour is crass and he has made sexist jokes time n again but for some reason theyr seen as funny. But overall he seems to be non problematic as long as you don’t get on his wrong side. And I guess he’s charming. Pretty much all his female costars have validated this. I don’t see it but there must be something.

Akshay - Way more shrewd than he lets on. Extremely money minded.   


Varun - I find him dumb but somewhat adorable. He’s a little cocky but harmless. Seems super nice to fans.

Salman - Have warmed upto him in the last couple of years or so. Mainly because of how relatable he comes across on BB..where He seems super chill and ...one of the guys..ltheres a reason masses connect with him the most out of all the superstars especially on reality shows. Seems to Be there for everyone and does a good amount of charity work but I have no doubt that his PR plays up everything to make him look like a saint. Hes arrogant and does not hide it. Can be a complete ass and insensitive at times. Overall I’m unable to figure him out . But my opinion on him keeps changing every now n then.   


Ranbir - The hardest to figure out. The most complex character in Bollywood IMO. His poker face makes it hard to understand the guy. On top of that pretty much everyone around him says hes not expressive and it can be very frustrating at times. He’s obviously very charming and the fact that he’s hard to understand adds to the aura and mystery around him . Heard that he’s very sweet to fans and completely chill to hang out with . But there’s something about his eyes ..comes off as super cold and not very trustworthy.

Ranveer - Was a huge fan. Not anymore. dont buy the good guy ..’im everyone’s fan’ image anymore. I find him pretentious now. Started disliking him after his sob stories about visiting US just once a year , talking about his family going through hardships ( when according to his BBB director he was the only debutant eve to drive to the studios in his Jaguar ).And I’m sure he loves DP but likes to really really play it up...with his I’m the best BF, I’m the best husband talks... overall harmless but phoney.   


will add more later."
27571,">I don’t see it but there must be something.

i think he isnt sleazy with them, prob doesnt inappropriately touch them or force himself in their space like we hear abt so many actors"
27572,">have never found SRK witty or charming. His sense of humour is crass and he has made sexist jokes time n again but for some reason theyr seen as funny.

Sexist jokes? Some examples?"
27573,There was something about wanting to “frisk “a Hollywood actress back when he was stopped at the US airport ..I think during MNIK ... then sometime back he said I like my women to be lying down when I talk to them...don’t remember the exact quote..there have been a few more.. ofcourse they aren’t insensitive like some of the remarks made by ither superstars (if I had to compare) but they are usually passed off as witty by his fans... he’s had his fair share of WTF statements.
27574,"I know he said ""HE does his every scenes laying down"" when asked how he feels working with tall heroines like DP. Dont know about actresses laying down tho."
27575,Very strange how things work. I was thinking of writing a similar article but you beat me to it :)
27576,Can u do this for female celebs too?
27577,> Bollywood actors & their personalities PR agencies wants us to believe.
27578,"Salman does charity work so the bad work he did in the past can be forgotten by people, not only his family but his circle is with him so he keeps them in the industry and stays relevant."
27579,Add hrithik amitabh Shahid
27580,"I love these posts! Thanks to the OP

SRK: Charming and affable. However, he is surely very intense and hard working as well. His work ethic is good and I find him to be a sensible and humble guy. He has also demonstrated intelligence in the way in which he has crafted his career.

Salman: What to say about Bhai? Gosh. Honestly I've was a fan before I got older and found out more about him. He is definitely incredibly arrogant and insecure. He seems to be unable to handle criticism and hence surrounds himself with 'yes' people. It is obvious people also use him and exploit him for his influence. Seems to also have a bad temper and aggressive streak.

Aamir: Can't stand him. Arrogant and pretentious. Seems to think he is the only person capable of acting in the whole of Bollywood. Fake as well.

Akshay: His work ethic and martial arts discipline can't be faulted but he does seem to be quite condescending to other people. His supposed philandering ways are also quite sad seeing that he is married. He seems easy to work with and charitable when needed though. Very smart with PR and the roles he takes.

Ranbir: Seems to be introverted guy and a bit of a ladies man. In general - he seems chilled and wants to be seen more as an artist than a typical star.

Ranveer: He is actually an underrated actor but his childish antics detract from the good work he does. He seems to be a bit eccentric but it comes across as try hard and extra. Truly loves his wife though.

Varun: He seems to just be a simple 'dude' or 'jock' kind of guy. I don't see him as very intelligent but he comes across as a fun and easy going guy. Seems to be more interested in commercial roles than 'real acting'.

Kartik: Maybe he is slightly overwhelmed by his success and make silly errors which people pick on. Overall, seems like a genuine but goofy guy.

Ayushmann: He really comes across as intelligent and a well rounded guy who has thought out his roles well."
27581,"Any interview of Aamir you can point out where he said he is the best actor ?

Most of the interview he says that he needs to put much more effort commpared to other actor e.g. Ammitabh, Dileep Kumaar, Raghubeer day and Zaira waseem.


Naseerudhdhin Shah says that he is one of the most secure actor and have no issue working with actors better than him."
27582,I never said Aamir said he was the best in an interview - I don't think even he would be silly enough to do that - it would be a PR disaster. You can easily google what people have thought of him especially during his Oscar campaign with Lagaan and his other movies as well. At the end of the day - these are just opinions of how we personally view stars.
27583,"He doesn't even give interview generally when his movie is not releasing. 

Why people ignore that he generally says that he is not natural actor and there are much more powerful actors out there.  

He also says that he is not perfectionists, all these tags were given by media because og the dialogues in movies

SRK has Badshah movie
Aamir had prefection  dialogue in Dil Chahta hai
Slaman got Bhai tag from Tere naam. 

Media likes to tag people with certain adjectives, that doesn't necessary make that actors are pushing it.  You can says that Aamir pushing it by doing only one movie at a time, but that doesn;t make any sense to lose so much money just to maintain a tag."
27584,"Salman Khan.. is a straightforward, too no political correct person sometimes,  very secure he doesnt care about low high   press praise image .. carefree and self-deprecating. He likes to play big brother to member of his family, friends, struggling actors, poor, ex gfs, outsider in general but you have to be loyal to him if not he writes you off you don't exist for him.

Srk.. He s charming and witty and uses  words in his favor he knows how to speak  .. There was a time where he felt invincible almost a God arrogant.. but failure take a toll on him lately.. He will comes back he s a good businessman.. He knows how to sell his image

Aishwarya.. She was labelled an ice maiden. She s. Very diplomatic and sometimes pompous and too perfect in public but I think with friends family she s very warm caring straightforward. A traditional Indian girl

Katrina kaif she s hardworking  a diplomatic person not too confrontational  she tried to mantein peaceful and good relationship with everyone in bw.. She can be sometimes moody but she s a sweet nice girl at heart..in search of love.. I hope this time she found it.. 

Akshay kumar he's hardworking and a warm person consistent in his last years..  he trys to portray an image of family man but we know he s a playpoy at heart sometimes too touchy Feely with his female costars.. I don't like his political association recently at all... stay out of it akki... Please


Amir khan is a perfectionist he s one of the few actor in bw who can do good commercial and content films.  He portray himself as an intellectual but sometimes lack substance

Ranbir k is a detached polite and talented guy he has a good sense of humor and he can be charming

Ranveer very versatile actor a warm intelligent and hardworking guy.. Just too attention seeking sometimes..he's more strategic than one can think of

Ajaj devgn brilliant versatile actor I like his sense of humor he seems a good father but as an husband well noooo words but if kajol is happy.. Well good for her

Amitabh so talented so popular  and so insecure.. too much.. he needs to be constantly reassured and to be considered.. 

Hritik r.. He s  handsome  great dancer  but can be a decent actor too.. He could be at khans level where stardom is concerned but he s worried. too much about numbers and failure so he is hesitant

Sushmita sen..not a great actress or too succesful not too interested in it too.. but  My favourite in bw.. carefree independent intelligent she lives her life at full at her own terms  .. Ahead of her time 

Preity zinta I like her she was a decent actress and I like her friendly  loyal and bubbly personality and her courage to testimony against underworld like no other actors  in bw and she filed a case against  his ex who was a member of a rich and powerful family for molestation.. Respect"
27585,"I add... varun.. Seems a nice warm uncomplicated guy. But we will see how he will react now that he seems in alow phase in his carrear

Kartik the new lover boy of bw.. He seems a nice smart guy 

Ayushmann talented one of my favourite aCtor . but he does always the same roles nowadays a little repetitive.. Friendly and well balanced man"
27586,"Srk : Arrogance Personified. 

Aamir : Mr. Perfectionist 

Salman : Perpetual Manchild

Ranveer : Attention Seeker"

27607,I think he is very goodlooking but he's too bland and arrogant which makes him unrelatable and intimidating

27612,Same. But there are times when I hate him too. Its a love hate thing I have for Ranbir. But yeah he's pretty attractive. Dude's gonna be 40 for God's sake and in the recent pics he looks in his late 20s ffs

like he can only really do a very few types of characters that somewhere resonate with his own personality making it easy for him..."
27684,Nope. I think he can pull off any character. I feel like he is someone who could do any role better than the original actors but I don’t think any other actor can play any of Ranbir’s role better than Ranbir. This is my personal opinion.

Actors I really like and expect to do well in the current lot (lead and supporting):Vikrant Massey, Vicky Kaushal, Ali Fazal (don't know if he'll get bigger but fantastic actor), Arjun Mathur (Iska time aa gaya), Gopal Dutt (The TVF fellow), Neeraj Kabi (Naya Naseer ban sakta hai), Shashank Arora, Jatin Sarna (Bunty from Sacred Games)

Actresses: Rasika Dugal, Kriti Sanon (I think she has genuine capabilities of being a star who will slowly improve her acting like Deepika), Sobhita Dhulipala (the next big thing: looks + great talent), Taapsee Pannu, Bhoomi Pednekar"
27686,"Hrithik - dancing skills, looks, acting is ok ok, i'm talking 2000-2013 years."
27687,Shahrukh's last few films have been really bad but he still has a certain place in my heart. Hope he again finds the critical reception he deserves very soon.
27688,"Aamir Khan is only actor whose fan  I can claim to be. 
My definition of fan is that I don’t miss watching his movie in theatre. I won’t fight fanwars for him or try to find excuses for his offscreen behavior. 

I also think a fan should also criticize when needed. So my criticism for Thuggie was harsher than others ."
27689,"you know I started liking ranveer esp during his padmavat promotions (and i gave up on bollywood a while back) and based on how dedicated he was and even was about to respect him but somehwere down the line during his promotions for simmmba and gully boy (esp when he had the level of self importance to jump into a crowd of people) i started seeing how crazy he is. No matter how talented he is, he carries his fame very poorly and he's taking it far too seriously. It's like they start to believe their own marketing material almost."
27690,"Srk since I grew up with him. Ranbir, Ranveer, Varun and all the new gen actors are growing on me heavy thoight and I have to accept that a new gen took over. Deepika and Alia are killing it too"
27691,varun? really? varun dhawan?
27692,Hes not the best but I dont really mind him at least.
27693,Big B. I grew up watching his movies. I still enjoy watching his better films when I can.
27694,Shashi Kapoor. He was damn handsome and good actor.
27695,"SRK is my favourite actor, and the reason being his acting, his persona, his charm on screen and his energy.

I grew up watching his movies more than any other actors. Both my elder siblings were SRK fans back then too, so naturally that had an influence on me. 

I have become a fan of his more through watching lesser known movies like Duplicate, Yes Boss and Baadshah.

His is the reason why I got into box office and movies in the first place. I even wrote an article on a box office forum about how my craze for box office increased through SRK movies: http://forums.itsboxoffice.com/629204/the-increase-in-craze-for-box-office-shown-through-srk-movies"
27696,"Shahrukh Khan. My childhood is intrinsically linked with him. My parents tell me that I used to sleep-dance when Aisi Deewangi used to come on TV. I remember watching DTPH as a kid in the theatre and trying to convince my bemused family that I want a love marriage in the future because ""someone somewhere was made for me"". I rebelled when they refused to change my name to Rahul (they convinced me to keep my present name by reminding me that my real name is actually one that SRK had in another movie). Whenever I'm down, I hark back to his old stuff and all the happiest memories just come rushing back. Oh and if you don't believe that ""pyaar dosti hai.."", please, be married for a couple of years and wait for the romance to die down. At the end, love really boils down to the depth of the personal connection you have with your partner


It's an emotional, irrational choice, but I love that man. His (possibly fabricated) backstory, his persona, his general opinions, his charm and wit during interviews... And of course loads of his movies. Of course, he's done some bizarre films in the past few years story-wise, but


After all these years? 


Always."
27697,"SRK

Ranbir Kapoor in new crop"
27698,"Ranbir Kapoor. Hands down - his performances have been great overall (not counting Sanju and a few others of course) and him not being on social media really adds to the mystique. He's the only 'star' from the lot; everyone has used social media and such to add to their brand. This man has built a brand with just his films, and yes some may argue his last name too, although I think he's outgrown that in the recent past. That man is really something."
27699,"sanju is the only film besides rockstar and rocket where he ACTUALLY acted

&#x200B;"
27700,What about Barfi?
27701,"I disagree with that the thing is he was choosing bad scripts like bombay velvet, roy and adhm(myopinion) and jagga jasoos too"
27702,Krk
27703,"I really like Kartik Aryan, Salman Khan, Tiger Shroff and Aayush Sharma. 
So basically everyone who is loved on this sub lol"
27705,No sunny deol?
27706,"I am only mentioning talented actors like Ayush and Kartik Aryan (self-made also).
Actually even Ayush ne bhi khud ko banaya hai....arpita ka pati"
27707,Guru Dutt
27708,"Shah Rukh Khan, there's just something about him that is not describable"
27709,Shah rukh Khan !!! Because he is so entertaining to watch.
27710,"Ranbir from new gen. AB from old crop. Ashok Kumar from even before. These are stars. My list of favorite actors is too long. 
Rk is dangerous actor. He is rare original actor in current crop with natural style of acting. 
AB's hey day movies needs to be watched on big screen with his fans. He was magic. I thank my cinephile mom for the opportunity. He is solid theater. 
Ashok kumar for being the actor who influenced diverse actors like dilip, dev anand and AB. His style and mannerism have been copied again and again,Only actor who had complete control over his career and made seemless transitition to charecter acting without being outed as old. Again he is natural actor."
27711,Manoj Bajpayee. He is great actor and does variety of roles with perfection. For me his acting in Aligarh is the best I've seen in bollywood.

Best lead performances in the last century."
27741,You really put Ranbir ahead of Irfan? Dear lord...
27742,This is an unordered list.
27743,But then why number it?
27744,Sorry.
27748,Women ka dege. Badme. Hrithik's performance in Lakshya was not as good as the guzaarish one.
27749,"Nawaz in GoW, Irrfan Khan in Pan Singh Tomar and Pankaj Kapoor in Maqbool"
27750,Vijay Sethupathi and Fahahd Fassil in all of their movies.
27751,"Oatmeal.  I like mine best with a sliced banana and a spoonful of peanut butter.  Walnuts, raisins, and maple syrup are also good toppings/mix-ins."
27752,"Agreed. Frozen blueberries, cinnamon, honey, chia seeds or protein powder are good additions too!"
27753,"Same here, overnight oats have been a favorite of mine lately! I do oats, plain Greek yogurt, chocolate protein powder, unsweetened cashew milk, walnuts, and frozen raspberries. Really yummy"
27754,"Eggs. I love eggs. Sauté some vegetables (tomatoes and onion are my favorite), scramble it with some eggs, add salt and pepper, boom!

Green smoothies! Any smoothie really but I like green smoothies because they are filling and you can get your greens for the day."
27755,"i read somewhere once where someone was struggling with a similar thing and was venting to their therapist, to which their therapist was like, yo, just eat whatever you want for breakfast... you’re trying to be healthy, practice self care, and hate typically breakfast foods? just have a veggie wrap 

that shit made me rethink my whole start-of-the-day regiment and now i like the idea of nuking one of those steamable veggie packs and hitting the road"
27756,"Water and coffee. 

Then you can spend more of that calorie budget on a bigger lunch, a snack, a good sized dinner, and maybe even ice cream."
27757,"hey I only have a kettle, no coffeemaker. Can you help me out with a suggestion on how I can make coffee. I tried the grinds and it keeps going in my mouth and it’s disgusting. I tried nestle instant coffee and that’s pretty gross too."
27759,Thank you both
27760,Coffee Gator makes a fantastic pour over carafe. Used it for a while now and love it.
27761,"My dude. Look up the Clever Coffee Dripper. It's like $20 on Amazon and it uses standard coffee filters. I've been in the coffee biz for a decade, and this is the easiest way to brew coffee. The aeropress only makes 10oz, which isn't enough for me."
27762,Try doing cold brew coffee. You can make big batches if it and it will last the whole week.
27763,"Yeah, forgot to mention I hate hot drinks."
27764,Go on youtube and watch a video on how to make cold brew coffee. It also has less bitterness then hot coffee so it maybe easier for you to drink.
27765,"You could pour it through a coffee filter into your cup (maybe with a funnel for support?) Or you could check out the aeropress (if you don't already know about it). I've never used it, but it seems super cool."
27766,"The Aeropress is fantastic if you're mostly brewing one or two cups at a time. It takes me between three and four minutes to brew my coffee, including the time it takes to boil the water. Perfect if you're in a hurry to get going or just want your morning coffee ASAP."
27767,"Nestlé gold is good if you make it with only milk, no water. But that's not cheaper substituting milk for water."
27768,Toast and cottage cheese. I usually put peanut butter on the toast or I'll do cream cheese and avocado without cottage cheese.
27769,"My go to lately has been 2 hard boiled eggs and overnight oats. 

Super filling and you can basically customize any overnight oats recipe to your liking."
27770,"Recently, since until school starts again i have mornings to myself, i eat soup and a yoghurt. I have to have light breakfasts and i find making a soup therapeutic, and eat the yoghurt while i wait. When i dont have mornings, im a big fan of eggs all kinds of way (currently in love with medium boiled eggs) because theyre either quick to make or i can make up beforehand and give great protein; toast or oatmeal usually go with it because without carbs im hungry in an hour."
27771,"Make a frittata! Cook up some veggies + meats if you like (bacon, cut up or ground sausage, etc), add  them to 6-12 scrambled eggs depending on the size of your pan. Season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder. Bake it for like 30-40 mins and you have a healthy breakfast for the week! 

** just make sure to use an oven-safe pan."
27772,"Okay my question is probably going to sound stupid but when you say healthy breakfast for the week, do you mean freeze it in portions and then thaw every morning? If yes, do you leave it out to thaw to room temp or do you microwave? I'm trying to eat healthier and this sounds like something I could do."
27773,"I usually portion it out and just keep them in the fridge, then microwave it in the morning. I’m sure it would work well if you kept it in the pan too. I keep the portions either in Tupperware or in plastic bags, depending on how much space I have in my fridge. 

I have seen videos of people pre-making breakfast sandwiches with eggs, freezing them in parchment, and microwaving them in a damp paper towel or something like that but that’s too complicated for me so I just stick with the fridge. Hope this helps!"
27774,Haha yep that does sound complicated. I like your way better. Thanks for sharing!
27775,"I love porridge/oatmeal and eat it almost every day. Favourite ""recipes"" include:

* Cook the oats with egg whites (I usually do a half cup oats with 1/3 cup egg whites) plus desired amount of water for super voluminous creamy oats. I usually add almond butter to my egg white oats
* Add a sliced banana before cooking, cook as usual then stir vigorously. The banana will disappear into sweet creaminess. I usually add almond butter to this combo as well
* Apple pie oats: diced apple and cinnamon
* Carrot cake oats: Shredded carrot, raisins and cinnamon
* Pumpkin oats: cook oats with canned pumpkin (super low calorie and high fiber!) then add either pumpkin pie spices, cacao powder or almond butter

I also love rolled oats uncooked. I'll stir them into plain Greek yogurt like you would granola. If you add peanut butter powder to this combo, it tastes like cookie dough. Or, I'll mix oats with peanut butter and jam like an unrolled ""energy ball""."
27776,Mmmm I need to try pumpkin oats. Yum!
27777,"My go to is 2 or 3 over easy eggs and a smoothie (chocolate protein powder, a banana, 1/4 cup blueberries, 4-5 strawberries, almond milk) but I'll warn... my stomach took a hit when i first started the smoothie. Prolly cause i wasnt eating much fruit prior to finding a smoothie i liked."
27778,Eggs and toast or PB toast.
27779,Yogurt and granola with a side of banana
27780,Whole grain toast with peanut butter and some type of fruit on the side. I have 30 min in the morning to get ready and out the door so it's quick and easy and keeps me full.
27781,"Oatmeal is pretty great and easy. I like to add walnuts and bananas. Always cook it with milk.

Hardboiled eggs are an easy grab-and-go. I especially like pickled eggs.

I like to mix Post raisin bran (it has the most fiber of the raisin brans at my grocery store) with a little bit of granola and eat it with plain yogurt.

This morning was cottage cheese with fresh tomato from my garden.

If I have just a little more time, I love breakfast sandwiches. I use a large mug or small bowl, sprayed with cooking oil, and beat an egg and maybe a little milk in it. Cover it with a plate and microwave for one minute, stirring halfway through. It makes a perfect Egg McMuffin style disc of scrambled egg. I serve it on an English muffin, sometimes with a slice of cheese."
27782,"Hi, try out some Indian healthy breakfast recipes like Poha, Idlis, Oats Chilla, methi parathas, aloo parathas. To get recipes, visit Thekitchenstories.com"
27783,"I love all of the suggestions here, but recently the most satisfying breakfasts for me have been... shredded wheat. (I'm an old lady now.) Super filling, healthy, and you can dress it up any number of ways depending on what you have on hand. Give it a try!"
27784,"I eat a banana or a cup of greek yogurt, sweetened with honey"
27785,"I'm a bit odd, I like eating two slices of seeded bread with hummus"
27786,"250 gram Beef patty with an egg on top.

Filling, good macros, cheap, easy to cook, tastes great. The important thing to remember is that there's no such thing as ""breakfast food"". Eat whatever you want, whenever you want."
27787,Toast + peanut butter + apple slices + cinnamon
27788,"It's not the quickest (prep and eat time is a little over 30 minutes), but every morning I have egg whites, half a grapefruit, and two slices of salmon avocado toast. It's about 550 calories, but it keeps me full and satisfied until the late afternoon."
27789,Oats are a blank slate to add almost anything to!
27790,"An egg sandwich. Sharp cheddar cheese, some bacon, and a fried egg on a bagel or croissant."
27791,I eat this almost every morning. I can't help but love me a bagel breakfast sandwich.
27792,"I love my egg sandwich just like that, except I prefer it on wheat toast.  And mine has yellow mustard on one side and mayo on the other.  (sounds weird, but is actually awesome)"
27793,I Love this...
27794,"Naw fuck a bagel, you have to butter up one side of two pieces of bread and fry those on the pan before the bacon or eggs. Recommended with mustard and pickles."
27795,"Full English. Bacon, sausages, eggs, black pudding, hash browns, mushrooms and toast. Couldn't eat it everyday - but for a special treat it's incredible."
27796,You forgot beans! I personally prefer the Irish breakfast though.
27797,Good man yourself!
27798,nothing beats potato bread
27799,Living here in America and being married to a Welsh woman I can verify that this breakfast is the best. We do exchange cooked tomatoes for mushrooms because fuck mushrooms.
27800,Shit. I forgot the damn tomatoes! :)
27801,How do you find motivation or time to get up and make this sort of epic meal? The only time I can do it is the weekend and I usually want to catch up on sleep.
27802,"Usually, for me, a full English is a hangover breakfast, we'll go to a cafe (or pub) an they'll cook the beast. If we are going out on the beer we'll get the breakfast from a pub with a pint and then we're on the beer the whole day. It's a good hangover OR starter breakfast."
27803,"it always starts with ""ah ill just have one to kill the hangover"" next thing you know its noon and im trashed"
27804,"Black pudding, is that like chocolate pudding?  Sorry for my ignorance."
27805,"Not quite, it's a mix of blood, oatmeal and fat that's boiled, sliced then fried :)"
27806,"Maybe it's just my american coming out, but that sounds horrifying. You are serious aren't you?.."
27807,Americans called it blood pudding or blood sausage usually.
27808,It's wot m8
27809,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pudding

It may not sound appetising - but I promise you it's delicious."
27810,"Just discovered a veggie black pudding and am literally over the moon, it tastes just the same so I'm pretty happy I can eat this again."
27811,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1215745/Could-biggest-English-breakfast-world.html
27813,"Depends, if I'm getting back on the piss then yeah, hair of the dog, if I'm hungover and not going anywhere, the best I can manage is a strong cup of tea!!!"
27814,Where's your beans son!!
27815,Full Scottish - as above plus sliced haggis
27816,Don't forget the tatty scones!
27817,Also a glass of IRN-BRU!
27819,"Fried bread - take a slice of bread and fry it in oil, you have fried bread."
27820,This sounds awesome!!
27821,"Bacon, sausage, egg, beans and toast is my spin on it, its incredible"
27822,"There is nothing English about hash browns.

Don't dislike them, but they are no less American than buffalo wings."
27823,I've heard eggs are available outside UK too.
27824,I even heard that compressed patties of potato have been fried since before the USA was ever colonised.
27825,Sausage gravy and biscuits!
27826,In England we call cookies biscuits. So I thought your breakfast choice involved gravy and cookies with sausage. Which is just odd.
27827,"Fluffy, flakey, buttery, puffed, golden, slightly salty and delicious. That's the best way I can describe it."
27828,Throw some scrambled eggs on the side and it's perfect.
27829,And some hashbrowns.
27830,Can you get a photo of this? In the UK this is not a thing. And it sounds like a weird thing.
27831,"I believe gravy and biscuits over the pond is like a scone with stuff poured on it. Or something.

EDIT: [Googled](http://www.whitelightsonwednesday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/biscuitsgravy.jpg)"
27832,"In my experience (full disclosure, i'm american), scones are generally sweet?  Am I mistaken about this?

American biscuits are normally savory.   It's basically a type of roll but a little different with a sausage gravy poured on top.  It really is pretty good, as long as you don't mind having your ENTIRE MEAL taste exactly the same, bite for bite."
27833,"Ah okay. In the UK we have different types of scone (cheese scones, fruit and nut etc) but the most common kind are pretty plain and sweet and would traditionally be eaten with jam and cream."
27834,Imagine a very buttery scone that is a bit fluffy.
27835,Imagine the taste that is more like nice pita bread.
27836,It's best served with a banger in the mouth.
27837,"Agreed, this will forever be the best breakfast. After a night out it's even better!"
27838,When I married my wife it was understood that she enjoyed the sausage gravy and biscuits.  4 years later she gets pregnant.  She STOPS LIKING THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY!  Now anytime I make it i have to hear about how she hates even the smell.  LIfe sucks.
27839,"Gained 40lbs in about 6 months because I ate biscuits and sausage gravy for breakfast every morning. Fuck if it wasn't delicious though. I had to stop, and change my diet, because that shit was killing me. I've always been a skinny guy, but in your mid-20's, metabolism slows down. Lost the weight and still love biscuits and gravy, just not every day."
27840,"I get a complete hard on every time I think about eating biscuits and gravy. My lord, forever the best breakfast"
27841,I knew it'd be the first comment. Thank you for not disappointing me.
27842,I heard that McDonalds doesn't sell biscuits & gravy to people outside of the South. Crazy. I couldn't go on without my biscuits & gravy. Or the South. ;)
27843,Hash browns and hot buttery toast.
27844,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm carbs and only carbs...
27845,Banana pancakes.
27846,Hmmm...is that you Jack Johnson?
27847,if it was jack johnson his post would probably be written in all the most annoying to play bar chords ever. somehow.
27848,No but I do love that song. Not as much as banana pancakes though. It was my first breakfast when I came to America. :)
27849,Steak and eggs and eggs and steak.
27850,that's what you should have for breakfast
27851,Delicious.
27852,Ah the rich mans breakfast!
27853,"Strawberry and Nutella crepe with hash browns and bacon on the side. My mom used to make this for me once a week when I was in high school.

Damn I miss home."
27854,"Bacon, French toast, Maple syrup."
27855,Canada in a nutshell.
27857,*Freedom toast
