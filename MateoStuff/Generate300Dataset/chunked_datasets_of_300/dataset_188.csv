61678,Here's another description: realistic Skyrim
61679,Yeah I guess. I never played Skyrim so I dunno lmao
61680,Most underrated game of all time ( it's very hard tho... I've warned you)
61681,I can not for the life of me ever find a bed to sleep and save in for my life. Just started it though. Seems good so far.
61682,"Persona 5 Royal is a must play, period. *Specially*, if you like RPG and anime.

If you liked BotW, Horizon: Zero Dawn might be right up your alley."
61683,"Get Sleeping Dogs. The world has been made really well: I felt as if i was really in Hong Kong. The game also has an excellent story and fun gameplay and so Sleeping Dogs is an extremely immersive game in which you feel that you really are a part of the Hong Kong triads.

I have played all Uncharted games, TLOU, Spiderman, Far Cry, GTA and many others. I found Sleeping Dogs to be better than all of them. Many may disagree that it is the best game, but most will agree it is a great game"
61684,Assassins creed origins and odyssey.
61685,Ffxiv
61686,I really liked dragon age inquisition. Also the new God of War (although it's more of an arpg.) Persona 5 is definitely a good one too.
61687,"Final Fantasy X/X-2 remaster.  It is originally a PS2 game so idk if you have played previous Playstation consoles but it is one of the best in the series and is very traditional compared to RPGs today. FFX is traditional turn based. X-2 tried to evolve the series with an evolution of turn based with a time gauge and faster inputs. It also introduced the job system so your character can change classes during battle which change their attack set.

Final Fantasy XII remaster is also good. It expanded on the job system.

FFXV is the evolution of the mechanics introduced in FFX-2 except you mainly control the protagonist and you can input side character commands as battles happen in real time. There is sort of a pause feature when accessing item menu so you can take time to figure some tactics if you need to pause.


There also is a pretty interesting F2P game that just released last month called Genshin Impact. This isn't a game that you can always play in long sessions however as there is energy like a mobile game and later in the game it takes time to complete things. That being said you can still easily put in 50 hours before you start feeling the effects of the time gate.

Edit: also forgot World of Final Fantasy. It's like Pokemon with final fantasy characters. You can get the vase game + maxima dlc for around $20."

61694,Surprised how far down in the comments this was.
61695,"Witcher 3. Essentially regarded in many lists as best RPG of the generation to date. 

Old, but really fun RPG in the zombie genre is Dying Light.

The Farcry series are shooter RPGs.

Diablo 3

Tomb raider series

Uncharted series

Divinity Original Sin series are absolutely amazing. In my top 3 of the generation.

Dragon age inquisition 

Kingdom Come

Pillars of Eternity 1 and Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. perhaps one of the most underrated RPGs in the generation.

God of War is an absolute must play."
61696,"I’ve played half of the Witcher 3 on the Switch, the issue is the graphics are so bad on it, so I’m tempted to buy again and replay it on the PS4."
61697,You would not be disappointed. Looks absolutely stunning on ps4.
61698,The load times are super awful on PS4. I ended up selling my PS4 copy and just getting it on PC.
61699,"Really? Couldn’t be worse than the Switch version, the load times seem to take ages on it."
61700,"I haven't played it on Switch, but the PS4 is so bad that it just wasn't fun to play as if you jumped from too high when exploring, you'd be punished with ages of loading.

It's the first and only game where I've just stopped playing because it felt like the loading times were a punishment for taking any sort of risk."
61701,"Code Vein, Ghost of Tsushima are really good"
61702,Trials of mana
61703,Ni no kuni 2 is 85% off right now in ps store. Maybe check and see if that interests ya.
61704,"More an action RPG but I JUST got into the Yakuza series and I'm pretty addicted. Finished 0, now I'm halfway or more through the remake for 1 (Yakuza Kiwami) and it's the only thing I'm playing till I finish 6. 

Gonna take some time and I'm cool with it!"
61705,Yakuza 7 and if you don't care about graphics to much DQ s is coming out December 4 and if you want a fun pokemon rip off their is also Nexomon
61706,😁Nier automata
61707,Battle Chasers Nightwar. It's very cheap and took me by surprise - it's very good if you are into jRPG
61708,"With Persona 5, it might be good for you to know it is *very* cut-scene heavy. That may be fine with you, but I didn't know that when I bought it and after a half-hour of cut-scenes at the very beginning of the game I became frustrated because I really wanted to just *play the game*. I ended up trading it in and when I asked about this online people said ""oh yeah, it has *a ton* of cut scenes"". Something I wish I had known before I bought it."
61709,This is actually one of the reasons I’m looking forward to playing it!
61710,Oh good! I hope you love it as much as others have :)
61711,"If you haven't played Dragon Quest XI on the Switch - well, get it on the Switch because it's got more content, but play that shit. At first it seems like nothing super special, but it sneaks up on you.

The Final Fantasy 7 remake is the most fun I've had playing a game all year, and that's saying a lot. It's not for everyone, so try the demo first because it's a good representation of what the full game is like. But they made a killer combat system.

All the FF games are solid but XII plays a lot like Xenoblade Chronicles if that's your bag."
61712,Divinity Original Sin 2. Its easily the best rpg on ps4 and one of the best of all time.
61713,AC Odyssey and Origins. Horizon. Sleeping Dogs. God of War.
61714,"Nier: Automata

It’s very noobie friendly in terms of combat, while still being challenging, excellently written, and one of the best games of all time in my opinion."
61715,If you're a big anime/manga fan you should check out Genshin Impact.  It is free to play (although it has quite a lot of cash shop stuff to purchase... be warned)
61716,"Yes definitely! I’ve already got it on my phone, so I’m looking forward to be able to play it on a console instead"
61717,"There are a lot of good RPGs. The ones I have are Horizon Zero Dawn, Spiderman, Jedi: Fallen Order (It's fun but not great), Shadow of the Colossus, and No Man's Sky. I haven't done much with NMS, but Horizon and Spiderman are really good"
61718,"How are any of the games you listed RPG games? Horizon is probably the closest with it's RPG elements, but I wouldn't consider that an RPG."
61719,"Okay so explain your definition of an RPG game, because I think we have different understandings of the term"
61720,"We definitely do. The games you listed are lacking the core elements of what makes an RPG. Player's choice story developments, crafting, grinding, weapon and ability upgrades, etc. 

While some of the games you listed may include some of these elements, they are more of an action-adventure game than an RPG. No one would ever say Spiderman or Shadow of the Colossus is an RPG. Games like Mass Effect, Fallout, and Final Fantasy are more traditional RPGs"
61722,"Okay yeah, you got me on Shadow of the Colossus, that barely counts in my book. I guess I see RPGs as just single player open world games, but your definition probably pertains more to what they were asking. Sorry"
61723,Many RPGs have fairly fixed story points. And HZD also has crafting and grinding and weapon and ability upgrades.
61724,I didn't say the elements weren't flexible. These are just features that traditional RPGs have. What are you trying to say?
61725,"That Horizon is an RPG. It doesn’t have deep RPG mechanics but it has all the ones you listed. No need to downvote, dude."
61726,"Well, I didn't downvote you and I literally mentioned that Horizon has RPG elements and is the closest game to being one in my previous comment."
61727,"I know you said closest to, I just wonder what else they would have to do to pass your RPG litmus test."
61728,I completely forgot about No Man’s Sky! That’s one I’m definitely going to try out :)
61729,Divinity 2
61730,I feel like that's a little overwhelming for a new comer.
61732,"Well then I have some bad news for you...

Sorry, I'm just very confused here, what?"
61733,Ghost of Tsushima!
61734,Horizon!
61735,"Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Zero Dawn Horizon, Beyond:Two Souls, Uncharted 4, Tomb Raider"
61736,"A top 5 won't be enough, but a top 10 will. Here's my list in no order:

- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

- Persona 5

- Bloodborne

- Horizon: Zero Dawn

- Fallout 4

- Nier: Automata

- Nioh

- Dark Souls 3

- Diablo 3

- Final Fantasy XV"
61737,Digimon Cyber Sleuth. If you like Digimon and Pokemon games this is perfect for you.
61738,Great list.  I think Final Fantasy XV will be the next RPG I buy.
61739,"FFXV is a mixed bag to be honest. It gets alot of (understandable) hate but it's nowhere near the worst game ever. A few things I will tell you is that the combat is a mess and doesn't even reach the standard for an action game, and I'm not joking, the story basically doesn't exist, heavy bold on ""basically"", the large open world is mostly bare as hell, and even on a disc the game takes up OVER 60GB, almost as much as FFXIV which actually makes sense to eat up so much space as it's an MMO that constantly gets updated and has way way more to do than XV does.

I enjoyed the game while I was playing through it (the story and chapter 13 pre-fix aside), but I can't bring myself to touch the game ever again. Redownloaded it twice within a week and just deleted it both times. The combat, especially for an action game, just makes it unbearable to go back to alone, which is all there is to go back to really.

Get it on sale/when you have more money than you know what to do with, or don't get it at all."
61740,"We should also mention that if you want the game's story to make sense, you'll need to watch the movie *Kingsglaive* first. The game doesn't actually tell you important things like the current political climate of the game's setting and why things are happening ... at all. Vital information that should have been in the game but for reasons I don't know, weren't included."
61742,Thinking about getting Persona 5 too. Is it recommendable even for someone who isn't too much into animes and that sort of stuff?
61743,"Yes. I don't really like anime much but I loved the game. It's strange at first because it's half turn-based combat RPG and half social simulator (going to school, hanging out with people to increase your rank with them, etc.), but it's just great."
61744,the way all the game play elements come together is addicting and fantastic and the story and dungeons are amazing
61745,"The style is anime but the story is a lot more grounded. Example:sexual assault, suicide, etc"
61746,"So, just like any other anime."
61747,Ff15 is really mediocre. Theres better rpg on ps4 that you can spend your time on kike persona 5 or valkyria chronicles
61748,"I wouldn’t classify DS3, nier, BB or HZD rpg at all. They’ve got RPG elements but I find them more open world action"
61749,Dark Souls and Bloodborne are definitely rpgs. You got many different builds and playstyles. Horizon is not even close to an RPG. Just cause it has an open world and some dialogue options does not make it an RPG. It's an open world action adventure game.
61750,Horizon is as much rpg as souls
61751,Don't most RPGs have characters to talk to?
61752,"I think this is a pointless argument, because some people consider the definition of ""RPG"" to be classic JRPG-style (aka persona, digimon cyber sleuth, FFXV, etc.) and others consider more actiony games to still be RPGS (souls, HZD, etc.). RPG is a very broad category."
61753,Horizon is as much a rpg as Final Fantasy XV.
61754,"> Dark Souls and Bloodborne are definitely rpgs. You got many different builds and playstyles.

That doesn't make a game an RPG. You can have different builds and play styles in StarCraft or Civilization, but no one would consider those games RPGs. Dark Souls and Bloodborne are action games, through and through. 

HZD is also closer to an action adventure game, just a larger world. Its RPG elements are basically window dressing that don't impact any quests, missions, etc. The story will always start, progress, and end in the same manner with some very small dialog variations from Aloy. The game is still great, and I'm going to get the DLC for it, but an RPG it is not."
61755,"Anyone who's actually played a table-top RPG would never argue that Soulsborne are RPGs. It's not even debatable. They have character creation, stats, leveling, equipment, treasure discovery, looting, bartering, NPC quests, lore, character classes, and dungeon crawling. RPG is not and never will be synonymous with turned-based."
61756,The Soulsborne Genre is an Action RPG. RPG = Role-Playing Game (usually heavily invested in some form of stat system).
61757,"> RPG = Role-Playing Game (usually heavily invested in some form of stat system).

Role playing =/= stats. Does Dark Souls allow you to RP a hard line, lawful good character? Or a selfish warrior? Or approach you with ethical questions? Or provide multiple approaches to addressing quests? Or a variety of dialog options? AFAIK, none of the Dark Souls games do. Story telling, characters, and dialog are usually not brought up when discussing Dark Souls' strengths . . . which usually begin and end with 'combat'."
61759,"I don't remember UC4 having any branching dialog? Just scripted sequences related to the set piece. 

> You can have a full magic build, full tank build, full dexterity build. And these aren't the only ways you can build your character in Dark Souls, you can have varying combinations of weapons and magic depending on how you allocate your stats. Dark Souls is definitely an RPG.

To reply to this specifically, unless you consider role playing a spreadsheet role playing, thats not an RPG. Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, Diablo, Rise of the Tomb Raider all have stats and different variations in character builds that will change how you approach the game play. But none have branching dialog. None have variations in quests. None have changes in the player's approach to NPCs. Regardless of how the player builds their character, the story and progression of each of those games will play out exactly the same way each and every time you play them. 

Compare that to a game like Pillars of Eternity. The player character has the usual skills and item stats, but also character specific backgrounds. These backgrounds come up in dialog, opening up unique options and paths, and solutions that wouldn't be available to a character that didn't have that trait. If the player pursues one path, it closes off other paths. If the player pursues an evil path, it closes off quests and spoils relations both party members and factions in the game world. Completing or ignoring party member quests, even the dialog choices chosen effect and change your role towards that party member. Witcher 3's dialog may be simpler, but Geralt is still a role for the player, and while its mostly predefined, the player still has a wide latitude in how they approach situations. Witcher 3 has a wide range of possible outcomes and results based on the players actions. 

I am not saying any of these games are bad, I thoroughly enjoyed Uncharted 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. I have both Lost Legacy and Frozen Wilds on preorder, and eagerly anticipate playing them. They just aren't RPGs unless your definition of an RPG is . . . extremely loose."
61760,">Does Dark Souls allow you to RP a hard line, lawful good character? Or a selfish warrior? Or approach you with ethical questions?

actually yes, every time you play online or meet a NPC these things enter into consideration."
61761,There are tons of RPGs that more or less ignore story and just focus on a good dungeon crawl. The souls games fit into that category.
61762,"> There are tons of RPGs that more or less ignore story and just focus on a good dungeon crawl. The souls games fit into that category.

Those aren't RPGs then, since there's no 'role playing' to be found. Those are action games. The Diablo series falls into that genre as well."
61763,"You can just be playing the role of adventurer in a dungeon. I've played a ton of Dungeon and Dragons campaigns that focus almost exclusively on combat, no one would deny D&D being an RPG. The original Final Fantasy has a bare bone story but I've never heard someone claim that's not an RPG."
61764,"> You can just be playing the role of adventurer in a dungeon.

Playing a spreadsheet is not a role."
61765,"""A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game[1][2] and abbreviated to RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development.[3] Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[4]""

61766,"Id say Nier and HZD hit about every criteria of RPG i can possibly think of. 

Levels, Questing, Upgradeable gear, etc."
61767,Same with Witcher 3
61768,Your point is only relevant to HZD. Souls games are literally a Japanese take on Western RPG's like The Elder Scrolls.
61769,"Persona 5. 
Bloodborne. 
Nier Automata. 
World of Final Fantasy. 
South Park."
61770,I never saw Automata as an RPG. It has some unique RPG elements but it's more of an action game.
61771,"It's an Action Rpg. After the opening, it's as much rpg as everyother rpg."
61772,Do you see bloodborne as an RPG? Nier has more rpg elements than bloodborne does imo.
61773,"I see them both as an RPG, but I would say Bloodborne is more of an RPG imo. Mainly because of the different builds you can do in the game depending on what stats you level up."
61774,"That just depends on what kind of rpgs you grew up on. Some people great up with Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, others grew up on Baulders Gate and D&D.

It's usually clear what a genre is by how you progress. If a game is mostly world exploration puzzles to progress, then it's adventure. If it's just puzzles to progress, then it's a puzzle. If it's mostly shooting to progress, than its a shooter. If it's mostly jumping around to progress, then it's a platformer. If it's mostly killing things in real time to progress, then it was action. If it was tactically micro managing troops progress, then it was strategy. If it was successfuly simulating people or events, then it was a simple. If it's moving one side to the other side, it was side scroller. 

Rpgs were mostly story based or level based to progress, but in todays world that's barely a genre."
61775,"I like this approach to the concept a lot, thank you."
61776,"I don't know why nobody is mentioning FFXII: The Zodiac Age, but it is amazing."
61777,Speed mode (2x or 4x) makes the monotonous parts so much better.
61778,Can you just toggle this? That would be so great for grinding.
61780,"Yeah, you just press L1 to switch it on or off. You can change in the options whether you want to go with 2x or 4x (I've done 2x and it helps so much)."
61781,"U can also hold down L1 and press left/right to switch btwn 0, 2x and 4x"
61782,"Ah thanks, I didn't know that. That would be quite useful if there was a pretty long stretch to get through."
61783,TIL. Thank you!
61784,"I second this. I'm almost 40 hours into it, and only about half way I think. I've barely scraped the side quests too, and it is so amazing. One of those worlds that sucks you in and captivates, and I haven't felt like this since Harry Potter."
61785,"I have yet to play it, so that is why I am not recommending it. The game was awesome on PS2 though."
61786,"1. Nier Automata

2. Horizon Zero Dawn 

3. Persona 5

61787,How's Berseria in comparison to Zestiria? Finished Zestiria and felt just ok for me.
61788,Berseria is better. My second favorite game in the series.

Persona 5"
61791,Valkyria Chronicles doesn't get mentioned enough. Love that game.
61792,Just reading this thread makes me realize how spoiled we are with great games this generation.
61793,And it's making me realize how unoriginal these lists can be.
61794,Lol what did you expect then?
61795,Persona 5!
61796,Persona 120?
61797,"1st: Nier: Automata 
2nd: Persona 5
3rd: Bloodborne 
4th: Nioh
5th: FFXV"
61798,The Witcher 3 should be on there as well IMO
61799,/r/gamingcirclejerk
61800,Totally disagree.
61802,"It's barely an RPG though, you can't design Geraldo, you can't really change his combat style, he's a jack of all trades. It's an Action/Adventure with RPG elements."
61803,"That it's not that much of a WRPG does not mean it's barely an RPG. It's absolutely and without any doubt an RPG. Much more so than HZD or Bloodborne, in my opinion.

Is it the definitive RPG as the other guy said? To that, I'd say no."
61804,"I mean, in bloodborne you create your character from scratch, customize their looks and class and specialize the character"
61805,"> It's barely an RPG though, you can't design Geraldo

Geralt. And just because he's an established character doesn't make the game less of an RPG. Everything about its variable side quests, characters, lore, etc, was at a level of quality we rarely see. Compare Geralt to the Dragonborn of Skyrim. Yes, you can design your own character down to the minutest detail . . .but the game completely devoid of any role playing, morality, variable quests, or even memorable characters. 

> you can't really change his combat style, he's a jack of all trades. 

Well thats just plain false."
61806,How's it plain false? He is a jack of all trades
61807,"You can make him focused on a signs build, or with alchemy and bombs, or light attack combat or heavy attack combat."
61808,"That's extremely slight. You can't make him an assassin, or an Archer, or a mage, he's just a sword dude with light magic"
61809,"You're role playing as Geralt, no where in the RPG commandments does it list that you have to be able to be an Archer or mage for a game to be an RPG.

Also technically doing a signs build is a ""mage"" build"
61810,Mario is an RPG because you play the role of Mario
61811,Yeah no. You're making some weak arguments here bud.
61812,">you can't really change his combat style

Did you even play the game? You can get through the entire thing almost never swinging your sword. If you think that there's only one play style for Gerald, thats on you. Don't unfairly label the game because of where you chose to put your points."
61813,"I completed one full playthrough in Nier, and got ending A, of course.  Many people say the third ending is simply amazing, would you agree? (I'm wondering if I should return to it for that ending.)"
61814,You haven't really beaten the game until you've played through 3 times.  You basically just beat act 1.
61815,Dude you haven't even scratched the game yet lol.
61816,The third playthrough of Nier Automata is one of my favorite video game moments of all time.
61817,Agree 100%. I'm so in love with that game.
61818,Very high praise.  I'll return to it next week.  I hope it's as good as advertised!
61819,"It is! The endings aren't so much endings as...plot lines in the overarching game, ending A gives you the bade story, the second ending/playthrough expands on that, and the 3rd and on give you content you have not experienced to continue the story."
61820,"just be warned that the second playthrough, while interesting, is nothing special. The third playthrough is truly phenomenal though."
61821,"yes you must, you're not even getting half the expiernce"
61822,Man that's like saying I got to Novigrad in the Witcher 3. Thats like getting to Trevor in GTA V. You did not complete Nier. Ending E is the final ending...
61823,Great way of putting it. Pretty much this OP. Make sure to go back and complete the game.
61824,To be fair if you got to Novigrad in TW3 you probably did all the best quests already. There's still some great content after that (I enjoyed a lot of Skellige) but nothing (until maybe the DLC) really livesup to those first few quest lines in the South.
61825,Man. I love the quests in Skellige. I still have to finish the Warewolf quest out there.
61826,"Depends, how much did you like playing through A?  There's a lot to get through if you want to go back and get all the main endings, one of which requires replaying the majority of the game again.  

If you liked playing through Route A, I'd say go for it because C is substantially better.  If you didn't like it, I wouldn't bother though.  I forced myself to push through to ending E just because of all the acclaim (C/D/E all come very close to each other, it's really just 3 playthroughs) and liked almost nothing about the game by the end.  If the story and gameplay aren't at least moderately interesting to you by the end of A, I feel like nothing will really change.  

It's probably not a bad idea to wait a while before jumping back into it, because Route B is a LOT of the same content as A.  It may feel pretty grindy to jump right back in."
61827,"This is how I felt about Nier: Automata. I felt a bit bad, because I tried my best to like it, to understand it and to go and emphasize the hype aroudn it - but in the end, after ending C - I really did not like the game and those endings did not make anything extraordinary to experience.
 It is an OK game, imho, with a bit of tedious things to do, for you to see the greatest ending."
61828,"If you thought it was tedious to get that ending you should try the original Nier, or basically any Drakengard. 

Did you get ending E? That's the only extraordinary ending IMO."
61829,"Thank you, but no :D I have done my research prior to playing Automata on Yoko Taro's work, reading up and watching a lot of info on Nier and Drakengards. (Whenever something is on hype and has a lot of backstory to it, I usually do my research and deep dive into it, whenever I am unable to play/experience it directly myself). I have platinummed Nier: Automata, doing all quests, and got all ""important"" endings, E included. However, I am not extatic and happy about the game, to me it did not live up to all the hype around it and frankly - I did not understand why it got hyped so much :("
61830,"Hate to tell you this but you never completed 1 full playthrough. You completed route A, but you still have route B and route C and endings D and E. That is classified as a full playthrough. 

It saddens me that so many people like OP put the game down after seeing the credits for route A. They don't realise they only played a third of the game.

If you have any questions incase your confused about how to play the game don't hesitate to ask and I can provide more detail"
61831,"That really isn't an ending. They call it that but the actual full game is after you keep playing and it has completely different content.  After you get ending C, D or E. The game actually ends after that."
61832,That's like only the prologue you've played. Get back to it.
61833,"Like many others said, you actually have to play the game 3 times. Each time it is from someone else's perspective and gets progressively better. There are also quite a few different actual endings to your third playthrough depending on your decisions, so make sure to try all out you can think of, it is worth it."
61834,"While path B is ""too similar"" to A, look at other games. When any other game offers you a NG+ mode, you play through exactly the same thing.
Here you play as a different character with a few new and changed mechanics, have somr new cutscenes and background info to collect."
61835,"yes, entirely"
61836,"""Ending"" A isn't actually an ending, it's more like completing chapter 1 of 3. Basically mislabelled because the game should be called finished when you make the choice between ""ending"" C or D, which actually results in a conclusion. And loading your save to get the other one results in ""ending"" E which is just the psychobabble that people circlejerk over."
61837,No witcher 3?
61838,Some people just didn't like it as much as other RPGs.
61840,"I haven't played many but on PS4 my favourites are Skyrim Remastered, Fallout 4, ESO and just recently started playing Nier Automata. With Nier is taking me a while to get into it."
61841,">With Nier is taking me a while to get into it.

If took me a few hours too, but I consider it GOTY now."
61842,Yeah I'm going to get back into it soon.
61843,How is ESO? I've been back and forth about getting it for awhile now.
61844,"I've been playing it for almost two years and I did stop for a few months until the Morrowind DLC came out. Honestly I like it but I do not really do any PVP, just quests and leveling up and hoarding stuff. I enjoy it. But I think I will start playing Nier again. Only played it for 2 hours and dropped it."
61845,"Yeah I definitely would play it more of a solo thing, so I'm not sure how that would play out."
61846,Cosmic Star Heroine
61847,"I'm currently in the middle of Tales of Berseria. I gotta say, I'm really impressed by how good the story is for this one. I have found it a very pleasant surprise so far. The gameplay is superb too. I'm not a Tales guru, but so far this entry feels like a big step up for the series."
61848,"Witcher 3

Divinity: Original Sin

Dragon Age Inquisition

Mass Effect Andromeda

Diablo III"
61850,Exploration. Loads of it haha
61851,"Nice list.  Diablo III is definitely a game I need to try, especially considering how cheap it is now."
61852,I certainly don't hate the game but I'm definitely surprised to se ME:A up there.
61853,Isn't a great Mass Effect game but is still a good RPG in its own right.
61854,To each their own. It was the first ME game that I just couldn't get through. Wasn't even bothered by the animations/bugs. I think it just released around things I liked better.
61855,"Nier Automata

61856,"Fallout, ffxv, nier, persona, yakuza"
61857,"I am throwing XCOM2 out there, feels like a strategy RPG"
61858,"No particular order

61859,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

Persona 5

Bloodborne 

Child of Light 

Bastion/Transistor/Pyre by Supergiant  - Cheating, but hard to choose out of the three.

I don't consider Horizon Zero Dawn an rpg hence it's exclusion from my list."
61860,If bloodborne is an rpg then every game is an rpg.
61861,"I had this discussion sometimes, and the fact that nowadays every game that has a leveling system and an equipment mechanic is called RPG bothers me.
 
Since action RPGs became more mainstream, many people try to fit any game as a RPG subgenre."
61862,"> nowadays

Stopped reading there. ARPGs have **always** been considered RPGs by everyone. The idea that RPG = turn-based is both sickening and extremely new."
61863,"I think you misunderstood me.
 
I didn't say that ARPGs are not RPGs. They definitely are, and has always been.
 
But many games are described now as RPG, when they would be more of action or adventure games.
 
What I said is that almost any game now try to fit in the RPG genre in description, because the name is appealing more than before.
 
I love both types, turn based or action."
61864,I know what you mean. I really can't think of Horizon as an RPG.
61865,"I dont think people consider only turn based games RPG's, its more that they think of going to towns with interactable NPC's, a heavy plot driven story, etc. etc. Its like how Tales Of games are definitely considered RPGs even though they arent turn based games.

I consider bloodborne an action-rpg for sure though. its definitively an action game, but the skill progression/leveling, equipement system, etc. are certainly RPG elements."
61866,People in this thread have played too many JRPGs and don't understand what an RPG even is anymore.. An action game like *Diablo* is more similar to a D&D session than anything in the Tales series.
61867,"HZD isn't an RPG, but Bloodborne and Witcher are? You have some weird criteria.

Not saying HZD is an RPG, but if it isn't, neither are the other two."
61868,"dude i also never considered Horizon an RPG until someone said it was on here.

I don't know why exactly."
61869,"Well, everything is an RPG these days. It's almost a meaningless term. 

To me, I know what I think of as an RPG. HZD definitely has RPG elements. 

Either way, my point was that the guy above me was inconsistent. Calling Witcher and Bloodborne RPGs is fine, but you can't omit HZD then."
61870,yeah it is largely pointless
61873,"Just curoius; what genre are the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series then? The characters are set like the Witcher or Horizon, with little room to 'role play' . Are they not RPGs?"
61874,"I don't know how it's possible for a human being to not consider *The Witcher 3* an RPG. It's unarguably an RPG. This isn't even up for debate. It's one of the most RPG games to ever RPG.

Just stop with this cancer already."
61875,Some people only class games where you make your own character an RPG. And I agree to some extent.
61876,Then that would mean Final Fantasy VII isn't an RPG.
61877,It's a JRPG. If you're forced to play a pre-defined character then it isn't a strict RPG.
61878,"""JRPG"" stands for ""Japanese Role-Playing Game"". It doesn't have any magical meaning. They're just RPGs made in Japan."
61879,"While that is literally true, there are certain conventions that tend to be associated with ""JRPG"".  These days, I don't even feel that a game necessarily needs to be made in Japan to be a JRPG.  Child of Light or Citizens of Earth jump out to me as being very ""JRPG"" style games that were made outside of Japan.  

If you want to argue purely semantics, you are basically playing a role in every game.  Which obviously nobody is seriously arguing, despite that being the literal meaning of the label RPG."
61880,"> If you want to argue purely semantics, you are basically playing a role in every game.

Role-playing game has a specific meaning though. It refers to D&D style games and the video games that have been adapted in that style."
61881,"I don't disagree at all, but I would say the same is true for JRPGs.  At least these days, I don't think simply ""RPG made in Japan"" is necessarily true.  Japan sometimes makes more western style RPGs and other countries make more JRPG style games.  

Cosmic Star Heroine, for example, is 100% a JRPG to me despite being developed by a US studio."
61882,"They are literally all the same. The same formula. There are RPGs made in japan that are just called RPG or action RPG. 

Nobody even said witcher 3 was bad. Why must you fanboys get so riled up whenever anyone claims something about your precious game that you don't agree on?

Downvoting every comment I make isn't going to accomplish anything."
61883,"Well, if Witcher is an RPG, so is HZD. They're essentially the same game. Just different stories and characters. But the gameplay is similar."
61884,"If W3 is an RPG, then so is HZD, the have extremely similar mechanics. Except you can actually customize Aloy's combat style more than you can with Geraldo."
61885,If you don't consider Horizon Zero Dawn and RPG then why do you consider Witcher 3 one?
61886,"If you've never played it before, Skyrim is a great RPG that really set a new standard for the genre. I think its pretty cheap these days too!"
61887,Skyrim did not set a new standar . It's not even as good as Morrowind.
61888,"It's good, but setting new standards? Please..."
61889,I just got into skyrim and I can't decide if I like it or not tbh. It's fun but to me it seems sort of grindy in the way that the quests are similar. Maybe I'm just new idk. There's a lot of fun too it though as well! I'm just saying I heard so many great things about skyrim it seems almost underwhelming now that I have it. I'll continue to play it and see if it gets more fun!
61890,"Try to immerse yourself more into the game. Read some books in the game. Every location is unique with its own story. In skyrim you can be any kind of warrior you want to be and change whenever u want. Hundreds of hours full of quests and so much lore! The witcher is more polished and is a lot bigger, but skyrim is just more hardcore."

61894,"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster

...Yeah, I'm not really into western RPGs. So sue me."
61895,FFXII Zodiac Age is up there for gameplay too. Characters and Story are still abyssmal though
61896,I'm unable to give an opinion on XII Zodiac Age yet. I've only played the PS2 version years ago.
61897,"Okay, magic goes back to FF. 

The thunder, fire, ice system. I just thought it was neat how GG did it. 


I just thought Horizon was going to be more like Uncharted less like it was.


My points for weapons is what it is it. Its mostly a positive point for the game itself. A lot of RPGs limit you to one weapon/weapon type


Yeah CoD is incorporating RPG elements but I wouldn't put it in my type 5 RPGs.


Horizon was a surprise genre classification for me. I honestly thought it wasn't going to be the way it was."
61898,"My top 5 tend to slant pretty heavily into the JRPG realm so they may not be for everyone. They are:

1. Tales of Berseria
2. Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth
3. Megadimension Neptunia V-II
4. Valkyria Chronicles
5. Disgaea 5

While I would consider Nier:A and H:ZD my two GOTY for 2017 I don't consider either of them to be RPGs in the traditional sense and see them more as action games with RPG elements like the older Zelda or Metroid games. 

I will also begrudgingly recommend Persona 5 or Witcher 3 as you may enjoy them since they are pretty popular games and well received by the community. I just could not get into the Witcher series but respect what CDP has accomplished. 

As for P5, since you're new to RPG's and have most likely never played anything from the SMT line you shoud love it. For me, I find the game to be  a stretched chore with some major pacing issues and shallow characters. Despite my complaints with P5 it is still a very stylized game with some solid music and fun elements that will leave you wanting more from the SMT family."
61899,"My favourite RPG's this gen are
Bloodborne
Persona 5
Final Fantasy 15

61900,Are we really all sleeping on Witcher 3 right now? Its not anywhere in the top 10 comments

61902,"Witcher 3

Deus Ex Mankind Divided

Wasteland 2

Divinity Original Sin (although the story and attempts at comedy are terrible, the combat is pretty great)

Mount and Blade Warband (flawed as hell, simplistic but yet still really good despite all that. Hopefully Bannerlord improves on the bad parts)"
61903,World of Final Fantasy is the best Pokémon game on the ps4
61904,"Have you played cyber sleuth? I hear great things about that. I haven’t played either game. I can vouch for ni no kuni on ps now. Which I’m pretty confident, is much better than WoFF."
61905,Cyber Sleuth is pretty darn fun
61906,I would say WoFF is better than ni no kuni nonetheless I'm so hyped for ni no kuni 2
61907,Bloodborne and The Witcher 3 have to be in there
61908,"You're going to get a host of people arguing the definition of RPG now, because every game has some RPG elements these days.  Nobody can ever agree on this.  I'm not going to get too deep into that argument but if there are some prominent titles here that I am not mentioning, it's probably because I don't consider it a pure RPG in the classical sense.  

Personally I go with (In no particular order): 

**Persona 5**

**Final Fantasy XV**

**Tales of Berseria**

**Final Fantasy Type-0 HD** (A remake, but I still really enjoyed it)

**Transistor** (This really stretches my definition of RPG, as it is much more a Tactical RPG to me, but I'm using it to fill my list out to 5).


I lean much more towards the JRPG side of RPGs which is why things like Witcher aren't on my list really."
61909,"I think what you consider a RPG is close to what I think. I tend to lean more on JRPG side as well.

I see some people say Horizon isn't an RPG.

Cases for:

Well you level up
Every upgrade you can craft and unlock most of before you manage 50% through the story.

Game is very open ended, if you can knock level 20 characters at 10, good for you.  It's a bit easy to cheese some enemies.

Includes magic: in the form of 
Ice, shock, fire, corruptions on arrows. It's not directly ""magic"" but you get my point. 

Has a few ""dungeons"" in the form of cauldrons but this my weakest point. 


Multiple weapons but they are mostly projectile 

Very similar to Witcher. You use a bow instead of sword.  Shorter too. The map is condensed beautifully."
61918,"If being able to use magic (that isn't even magic) means RPG to you, I just don't know what to tell you. And if having a leveling system means RPG, then Minecraft is an RPG.

Minecraft is not an RPG. Spoiler alert.

I'm not gonna bother with ""Is HZD an RPG or not"" nonsense as the term ""RPG"" is one the most vague things, and I don't own the game and so I don't care, but your points, if you can even call them that, flat out suck. Especially multiple weapons? What? So COD is an RPG now? Please just stop."

The last 2 are questionable to be called RPG's, but frankly I loved all 5 of them. Never got around to finishing Bloodborne, but it was fantastic from what I played.

I will say that the Witcher 3 is so far above and beyond any other RPG, or really game, that i've played, and they are my favourite genre."
61923,"Nice list.  Interesting that you say Andromeda.  Many have maligned that game, as I'm sure you know.  I'll try the demo soon to how it is."
