9386,"As somebody who goes to the dentist, I know that flossing regularly is definitely more important than the brand of toothpaste you use."
9387,Have you been flossing?  ........
9388,"Yes, mom."
9389,Flossing. Where'd I get Munson from?
9390,"As someone who goes to the dentist, they've never told me to floss. I barely every floss. Maybe once each few months, to catch a particularly stubborn piece, but apparently, my teeth are just fine. Not saying flossing is not important, but maybe I'm a _really_ good brusher?"
9392,"If your gums bleed when you occasionally floss, then you should be flossing more. Otherwise I guess you're fine? The whole point us to dislodge bacteria and goop that your brush couldn't otherwise reach, so if you're really good at brushing or your teeth are really spaced out then you're finesauce."
9393,"One day your teeth will look up your dentist and shout ""Save us!"" And your dentist will look down at them and whisper ""No."""
9394,"I always choose Glide, because it doesn't fray when flossing your mouth, it just glides."
9395,My favorite. I'm glad they sell it at Costco.
9396,"Agreed, everything else disintegrates in my mouth."
9397,When does flossing stop hurting like a tiny midget raping your mouth?
9398,"Like after a week

There are also those floss-on-a-stick thingies that are supposed to be more gentle"
9399,"Floss on a stick guy here. I honestly cannot do regular floss. The floss on a stick is way better imo may not be as effective but it makes the experience a lot less painful. 

Floss before it's too late kids."
9400,"[I clean my teeth with a floss on a stick](http://i.imgur.com/uy1mnO3.jpg)

Sorry, had to :D"
9401,"Ok I floss everyday. What I've learned is #1, don't cheap out on floss. Yeah it might be $2 less to get the shitty store brand, but floss lasts a long time anyway so just get the good stuff. The waxy kind. It's so much more comfortable. #2 don't ""snap"" the floss in between your teeth, that hurts and isn't good for your gums. Gently move the floss back and forth to get in between your teeth instead. #3 Make sure you get down into the gums too like between the gum and tooth, not just between two teeth. Trust me, sounds kinda weird but you won't believe the gunk that can come outta there! 

After a week, it shouldn't hurt, and your gums probably won't bleed anymore. It seems like a lot of work at first but if you do it enough, it's like second nature and if you don't do it everyday you will fucking notice. Like my breath will smell worse if I don't floss. My mouth would feel super unclean to me if I were to skip."
9402,"Definitely this. I didn't used to floss because it hurt. When I got older and my teeth got shitty, I started flossing, and it didn't hurt at all. Even with sensitive, bad gums. The trick? 

Good floss (glide, baby!), and GENTLY shimmy it between the teeth, then pull it so the floss cups as much of the surface of the tooth as you can, then pull the other way to get as much of the surface on the adjacent tooth. And don't forget to floss the backs of your back-most molars, they need it too!

My only problem is I tend to drool on myself. frik

 Also, make sure to brush for at least 2 minutes (but no more then 3). Get a stopwatch on your phone and time yourself, you're probably not doing it long enough. It's an easy habit to make so make it when you can. Soft-bristle brushes, and use the same pressure you might use to polish a tomato. No whitening toothpastes. If you're going to use mouthwash, don't use Scope it's trash. Something like Listerine, the ADA accepted ones, nothing fancy. If you do wanna get fancy, include ACT mouthwash. Again, the simple one, ADA accepted. Time yourself.

Oh and also get Xylitol mints for after meals/snacks/etc. It lowers the pH in your mouth which makes it harder for bacteria to grow and strengthens the teeth. Plus it's tasty. 

Is...is it obvious I developed severe teeth/dentist anxiety? Don't care. This is the best-of-the-best tips/info I found when I was freaked about it, and it's what I use. Also brush at least twice a day, preferably three times after each meal. But wait about 30min, and/or pop a xylitol mint then brush. Brushing too soon after a meal can cause damage to the teeth, since the acidity of your meal weakens the enamel slightly. Reduce/avoid soft drinks, and don't sip sweet drinks throughout the day."
9403,"Question, my dentist ""snaps"" the floss between my teeth instead of doing the typical see-saw motion (Like, he rests the floss between two teeth and just pulls), and then he just pulls it right back up. What is he hoping to achieve?"
9404,"Dental student. I have Colgate Total at university, and Oral-B Pro Expert at home. Only got the Colgate because they didn't have Oral-B."
9405,"> Oral-B Pro Expert 

There's an Expert mode?!"
9406,"Yeah, you have to prestige three times though before it unlocks."
9407,"Fuck, I'm not that good! Is there a microtransaction that'll let me buy the expert mode?"
9408,"This isn't the ask reddit thread that i want, but it is the thread that i need."
9409,"If dentists make their money off of people with bad teeth, why should I trust a toothpaste that dentists recommend?"
9410,"If your physician makes more money off of sick people, then why do you trust what they tell you?  It's because our jobs are to help you be healthy.  Trust me, filling a shit-ton of cavities is not my idea of a good time."
9411,"And removing plaque, mmhmmmmmmmm"
9412,There is more money in people with teeth than in people without. Dentures don't need much treatment. The demand side of the equation grows strongly with more people keeping more teeth until older age.
9414,"Because you're supposed to go to the dentist twice a year or once a year (depending on where you're from) anyway. So they're still getting paid.

I'd also like to see people apply this logic to other doctors. ""My cardiologist gets paid for me having a bad heart so why should I take these lifesaving meds!""

Plus most people still aren't flossing. Brushing only does so much, you still have tons of decaying food in between your teeth."
9415,Because they'll come out when you're old anyway
9416,"Similar predicament:

(As a buyer) Why should I trust a realtor to fight for a better price, when their commission is based on the final sale price?

(Yes, I am aware that buyers agents are a thing)"
9417,"I didnt, so I bought my house without a realtor. Just had a lawyer draw up the paperwork for a tenth of what the realtor would have cost"
9418,I'm gonna do this next time
9419,"It works! If you have a website to find listings, are willing to do a bit of research and don't mind negotiating a bit (I hate that part), you can save literally tens of thousands of dollars. Realtors are car salesmen and are completely redundant in this day and age"
9420,Because people are bad at following instructions.
9421,"Dentist in Australia. I have both Colgate and Oral B in my bathroom right now, because both of them send me free samples. Which one do I use? Colgate total is my preferred toothpaste, mainly because of the triclosan and co-polymer that keeps it active for 12 hours. I use Oral B when colgate runs out because I'm not sure if the difference is worth going out to buy a tube of colgate when I know I'll get a free one in a month or so.

With regards to toothbrush, I received an oral B electric toothbrush in 1st and 5th year of dental school. The one from first year broke 2 years out, which is when I cracked open the second one. Only seen the colgate toothbrush at trade shows but from hearing from other dentists who have used it, it doesn't work as well nor is it as comfortable.

TLDR; colgate total toothpaste, oral b toothbrush."
9422,"Ok, but which direction do you brush in Australia?"
9423,"My oral b toothbrush spins clockwise, I think in the northern hemisphere they spin the other way. Can you please check and report back to me."
9424,Don't they vibrate back and forth?
9425,Only at the Equator.

9448,Didn't Triclosan just come under fire for not being proven to actually kill bacteria?
9435,"Yep. A 0.3% concentration is an ineffective bacteriacide. BUT...it's just effective enough to change gut bacteria. 

We are breeding resistant bacteria by using antibiotics in our soaps and toothpaste. The ones we kill off are the useful ones."
9436,That's what I figured. Awesome.
9437,"According to a Bloomberg article, Triclosan has been linked to cancer and has been banned in the EU from food.  Glaxo and P&G have removed it from their toothpastes.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/in-35-pages-buried-at-fda-worries-over-colgate-s-total  FDA and Mayo clinic indicate there are real health concerns about Triclosan, though it does not at this time recommend avoiding it (apparently Triclosan is in lots of products).   http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm205999.htm  http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/triclosan/faq-20057861  For more info, try searching on ""triclosan fda"""

9440,The bristle with excitement
9441,More excitement than you can handle.
9442,Ha
9443,"Haha.. its not a toothbrush trade show, more like a dental trade show. Colgate and Oral B always rock up, more to give dentists information on the science before their new products than actually selling a product, their market is the mass market and dentists are the ones who advise the public on what to use. For us, this is a very minor part of the trade show. Other companies like Sirona, Dentsupply, Henry Scheil Halas, GC, ivoclar sell dental equipment and materials (think dental chairs, sterilizers, lasers, filling materials, crown and bridge materials etc) are always there to showcase their new products and generally have some sort of trade show discount. These are the ones we are more interested in to be honest, but its worth going to colgate/oral b for a few minutes just to update ourself on the latest products. Other companies like practice management companies, finance companies aiming for the healthcare market etc normally have booths too."

9450,"Ho-ho-hold up - you're on a dentist's wages, and you're worrying about *buying* a tube of *toothpaste?*"
9451,Rich people aren't stupid with money. They just have more of it.
9452,One of the richest people I know wears cheap sunglasses with tape around the bridge.
9453,You don't get rich by buying something you get for free.
9454,Where did he say worried. He's not being wasteful because he's *not* worried that the difference will affect his health.
9455,"Yeah, its more about not wasting the tubes I have lying around as I don't think the difference between the two would be large enough to go out and buy colgate."
9456,"What if one was allergic to triclosan, what toothpaste would they prefer them?"
9457,"They keep the actual copolymer under wraps, its their secret! The thing with triclosan is if you brush with it, it washes away very easily and within minutes after brushing plaque starts forming around the teeth again. What the copolymer apparently does is stick the triclosan to the tooth for 12 hours so it stays active and prevents plaque build up. This is why colgate claims 12 hour protection when none of the other brands do."
9458,"My father was a dentist (USA retired), his spin on the toothpaste debate... Anything approved by the ADA (American Dental Association, it will have their official logo on the box) has been tested and proven to be effective.

And samples in every bag.
I have too many toothpastes."
9465,I have ClinPro too but I hate using it. It doesn't give that frothy satisfaction that you do with regular toothpaste.

It's the only brand I've used since then. Bonus for it only costing about $1 at Walmart for a tube that lasts pretty long.

Bonus knowledge: Buy toothpaste without laurel sulfate in it if you don't want it to effect the taste of things immediately afterward. (like orange juice tasting gross) its the ingredient that makes the toothpaste foam up though."

9488,"Not a dentist, a hygienist. I use Prevident."

If you want to whiten your teeth, but risk the sensitivity that may come along with it, use whitening toothpaste.

If you have sensitive teeth, use sensodyne/pronamel.

9545,"I am outing myself as a Registered Dental Hygienist here: use whatever you want, unless you are having problems.  If you have a lot of canker sores, avoid products with SLS.  I don’t recommend whitening toothpastes because the abrasive particles are a bit harsh.  If you want to whiten, try Crest Whitestrips, or go for the professional bleach from your dental office. Definitely always use soft bristled toothbrushes!  I buy Colgate Total for my family.  Please use fluoride!  All these non-fluoride products, and filters are causing a ton of decay.  
EDIT: Flossing daily is extremely important for keeping your teeth for your whole life.  You do not have to lose them due to “old age”."
9546,"Out of curiosity is there anything I can do to help repair my teeth if they're already really fucked up? They always have been, I assume genetics had a lot to do with it."
9547,"It’s hard for me to answer that without being able to see your chart.  If it is primarily decay that you struggle with, fluoride is your best friend.  You can buy a fluoride rinse (store brand is fine), and before you go bed, brush, then floss, then rinse using the fluoride rinse for 30 seconds.  If your teeth aren’t sitting all nice in a row, like picture perfect, it can make it difficult to keep all the little spaces clean... this is when an electric toothbrush can be very helpful.  I hope this helps :)"
9548,"I had chronic canker sores until my 30s when it occurred to me that my toothpaste might be the issue. After some research, I learned to avoid SLS. What a life changer! The only time I've had a sore in the past three years is when my boyfriend bought a Toms toothpaste and neither of us read the ingredients, assuming it was safe. SLS free is not always easy to find, so I stockpile them when I find something good at marshalls, ross, etc. 

Jason's coconut toothpaste is my favorite, followed by Bronners cinnamon."

9554,And who is that one asshole who won't recommend anything?
9555,My dentist said nothing matter as long as you brush twice a day and mouthwash; with a manual brush.
9556,"Lmao, manual brushes... What is this, the middle ages?"
9557,Ive never used an electric brush..
9558,One of the Best investments I’ve ever made. I’m curious about the post above saying manual. I’ve read both are fine but that they tend to find people who use electric toothbrushes tend to brush longer since they’re timed
9559,"My impression from reading and talking to my dentist isn't that manual toothbrushes are inferior, it's that the vast majority of people don't have good brushing technique, and it's often easier to invest in an electric toothbrush to close this skill gap than to try and learn and keep up with a correct manual brushing technique.

I was convinced to get an electric when they offered to sell me a top of line Sonicare ""at their bulk discount cost"". While I'm not 100% sure that they were really selling it to me at their own cost to buy, it was $100 cheaper than the same model sold on Amazon. Also it takes all the work out of brushing."
9560,My gf buys me and her bamboo toothbrushes that can be recycled of even composted if you pull the bristles out. Woot for no plastic waste!
9561,So you pull the bristles out because they are plastic and can't be composted? Are they not waste at that point?
9562,Yeah they are but it's a hell of a lot less plastic than an entire regular toothbrush or the disposable heads on an electric one
9563,"> I’m curious about the post above saying manual. 

If you are brushing properly, an electric brush will make little to no difference.

If you aren't, then an electric brush isn't likely to help.

In other words, an electric brush can give you a false sense of security and make you lazy, leading to you not brushing properly."
9564,Sensodyne. Toothpaste for sensitive ~~teeth~~ little bitches.
9566,Have fun with your canker sores.
9567,Only certain varieties have SLS. And canker sores are cake next to sensitive teeth.
9568,"My dentist said it doesn't matter which toothpaste you use, as long as you are brushing regularly and properly with bristles not overly hard or soft."
9570,"I’m actually allergic to SLS and it’s a bitch finding products without it. 

It’s put in nearly every toothpaste, shampoo or soap for its foaming property, which people associate with “clean” but don’t realize it’s a harsh detergent. 

Orally, I get mouth ulcers if I use a toothpaste containing SLS more than once or twice. Topically, shampoos with SLS worsened my seborrheic eczema, until I figured out that it aggravated my skin too. 

But, people like that “cleaning” foam/lather, so it’s not going away."
9571,Jason and Dr. Bronners make great SLS free toothpaste!
9572,"Jason brand is great! 

We had a little trouble finding a product to help with enamel erosion from orthodontic braces, but we finally settled on non-fluoride MI Paste (calcium phosphate) which should work just fine as an adjunct, because all the other fluorinated toothpastes had SLS."
9573,"I thought cleaners just *did that*, not because of some other shit put in them.

Now you're gonna tell me that bread only leavens because they use yeast in it. Ha."
9574,"If they cause mouth ulcers, why are they recommending using them? I'd steer right clear of those toothpastes."
9576,Ah. That makes so much more sense.
9577,All of the Sensodyne products are SLS free!
9578,Used to be but that’s not true anymore. You have to look. The ProNamel stuff doesn’t have it.
9579,20 comments so far but none from actual dentists wtf
9580,"Mr. Jones, your account shows you have been a member of this website for over 5 years but your comment has determined that is a lie"
9581,"Please, Mr. Jones is my father. My actual first name is Mister."
9582,I would suggest using baking soda as it has a lower RDA (relative dentin abrasivitity) value than any toothpaste and its alkaline nature neutralizes acids and helps promote remineralization of the enamel. It also helps to whiten your teeth somewhat. Use a fluoride mouthwash afterwards.
9583,"Isn't tooth decay mainly caused by acidity? I would think that using baking soda to buffer the mouth slightly above neutral pH would much more important than is recognized. Most baking soda toothpastes are marketed as a good whitening abrasive, and less for it's buffering effects. 

I wonder if there are studies on if baking soda mouthwashes are as effective, as it doesn't seem to have made it to the market."
9584,Not a dentist but my friend's mom is a dentist who owns an entire clinic and she said to avoid most whitening toothpastes and to just stick with the original and scope kinds. She also highly recommended a water pik.
9588,I used your Colgate toothpaste.... And it made me feel... Like a piece of shit!
9589,Sugar.
9590,Doramad for that radiating white glow.
9591,"Worked in a dental office as for brand we carried crest 3d I tried using it I did notice a slight improvement in whiteness.
But the most important thing is brushing and flossing your teeth regularly and use a water pick if you don’t want to floss conventionally"
9592,What about Emoform toothpaste? Does anyone know it and recommend it?
9593,Pork fat mixed with ashes.
9594,Paste Picante ?  before or after my breakfast burrito..

9597,Which ever gets you to stop reposting old askreddit questions.
9598,"Santa Cruz. It's the newest/most modern out of the Chi 5 dorms, ocean view from some rooms, close to DLG (dining common), and the one I've generally heard the least complaints about (regarding ants, bedbugs, broken elevators because it's a low-rise, etc.) I had a bunch of friends in Santa Cruz my freshman year so I was there a lot, seemed a lot nicer to live in than San Mig, where I lived."
9599,"Santa Rosa for best showers (if you're looking for Chi-5 and don't mind communal). Good water pressure, warm enough for the winter. Lounges are nice and clean with tidy kitchenettes on the side. Mini gym on 2200s wing. Closest chi-5 dorm to classes, so super convenient rushing to classes when you're short on time, especially for those that walk or skate.
Santa Cruz for nicer rec room + theater ( you don't have to live there to rent it out tho!), but water pressure sucks and the first floor lounges are really small. Second floor lounges are more spacious with kitchenettes, but there are no towel dispensers in them for some reason. 
San nic can be nice if you don't mind elevators. Less walking to get to your room compared to navigating the shorties. Elevator wait can be really annoying and actually nip u in the arse when you have to rush somewhere. However, if you live on 1-3 floors, you probably won't be using the elevator much anyway. Showers are sad and dinky, but water pressure is decent. There are all-gender bathrooms on the first floor.
San Miguel's gym is nicer than Santa Rosa's, but you just need an e-key from any residence hall to access it. 
Manzi's lounges are really nice with better kitchens compared to chi-5. Personally, I think Carrillo has the best food consistently and interesting soft serve flavors. But often times, Ortega and dlg can impress with cool things.
Can't say much else. This is all I know from personal experience. Good luck!"
9600,ft (san cat) is pretty fun and the most social dorm i would say. it also has a nice dining commons which is less hectic and more open. there’s a real sense of community. it is way further from classes than other dorms though.
9601,"Def one of the Chi 5 dorms if you want to have more chances interacting with other people. It all depends on how social you want to be. But Chi 5 dorms provide that the best. The least chance would be manzi and san raf as they are mostly occupied by 2nd years. But then again, RAs hold events and stuff there too so if you want to meet new people, you still have a chance."
9602,"Santa Cruz! It's very social so it's easy to meet people! Many rooms have a view of the ocean, the staff is super friendly, it's close to campus and a very happy living environment! I loved it sooo much!"
9603,"Most social: San Nic 
Most chill: Manzi
Best dining: FT

Idk just my take on it"
9605,"Right? Old Portola was the shit hole, Ortega was also a shit hole but at least it was on campus, DLG was overrated but consistent, and Carillo was a hidden gem."
9606,FT people are the people I still talk to the most post-college tbh
9607,"I always noticed that the people who stayed friends after first year were those who stayed at FT. I lived in Santa Cruz and I loved it though, on campus and a very short walk to Campus Point."
9608,FT is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. My floor became my family. We are all still incredibly close.
9609,8th floor south?
9610,all about north tower smh
9611,wtf nah son
9612,Jeeeeyyyyyuuuus
9613,damn straight
9684,What is FT?
9615,san cat
9616,"I really didn't want to be in FT either, but ended up getting put there and was super bummed...but it turned out to be really great. It gets a bad rep for being so far, but in turn it creates a community that is awesome. All the floors are coed (except for a few), you have a pool, your own dining commons, etc., and things can get pretty crazy there. Yeah it's far, but it's only for a year, and you'll have IV the next 3 years. I hung out with friends in all the other dorms, and the social life paled to FT. So yeah, I would definitely say FT for sure.

If you're really set against it, Anacapa and Santa Cruz were decent.

Edit: I can't grammar"
9617,"FT. It may sound terrible now but, trust me, go FT."
9618,"I'd recommend not getting a room in Manzanita...it's super spread out and not very social. I had the same feelings about FT, but after visiting my friends there I had major FOMO."
9619,"Well, I can't tell you which is best, but I personally love Anacapa. I'll tell you most of the people who are in San Miguel, Manzanita, and Santa Rosa tend to want to move out. It's a bit anti-social and quiet. 

My experience:

- Low Rise/ 2 Story Dorms - 
*Good for a more calm sense of community, less hassle moving stuff, more spacious rooms, all are forced triples
*RAs are more chill as well as the RDs 

Santa Cruz - Recently remodeled, has a very modern and beachy vibe. Showers and bathtubs are clean, but are a bit tacky. The color scheme may be off but overall probably the most ""chill"" (you could argue that for Manzanita but that's more ""boring""). Right next to DLG dining commons.

Santa Rosa - The oldest dorm out of the three low rise dorms. Very big, home to Black Scholars floor. To me, it always seemed anti-social, quiet, and almost eerily creepy sometimes. Everything is older, bigger, and in general does not have the homey feel Anacapa and Santa Cruz have. Has a piano tho and right next to DLG. 

Anacapa - People say its the most social/upbeat out of the low rises. I would say that's true. It was remodeled the year before Santa Cruz and the carpet and walls are bright and cheery. Home to Scholars and Asian Pacific Islander Floor. I'm personally on the API floor although I'm not asian and everyone on the hall pretty much knows each other even if you're not super close. Very social and a very popular pick. We have some cool RAs too. Also, beach views.

- High Rise Dorms -
*floors can be very social, but equally not as social 
*less spacious
*usually a mix of doubles and triples or just doubles

San Nic - Home to FSSP, everyone knows each other since you spend like 6 weeks with one another. Extremely social atmosphere but half the time elevators dont work so moving can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Right next to DLG, Ortega, and UCEN.

San Miguel - For some reason not as social as FSSP, and I think all are doubles. A lot of my friends don't spend a lot of time with their dorm friends but you know thats just me. Right next to San Nic, which is right next to Ortega and UCEN.

FT - Crazy ass social dorm. 1 mile off campus means less incentive to leave which means more time in your dorm partying. A lot of hooking up and little parties, the RAs are more a bit more strict here. You get to know people on your floor and its very easy to get to know people in your building. Has your own pool and dining commons, not too far from the shopping center by bike. 10 min bike ride to school or your take the bus. You get a lot of ""FUCK FT"" hate but uhhh right of passage I guess

Manzanita - In it's own little bubble. Home to second years +, so it's quieter and less social. People move out because they want the more social freshman experience but its not impossible to have fun. One of my friends is on a health floor (I think) and loves it. Roomier, and has a more ""family"" feel to it, but also more isolated, and on the other side of campus (Carillo dining common). But you're also closer to IV.

Basically this is from my experience visiting and talking to friends. I don't know all the different types of floor communities by heart. Definitely talk to some people about it. I'm on API and I've met some amazing people here :)"
9620,"Besides ft, there is san Miguel, San nicholas, santa rosa, santa cruz, and anacapa. These are all in the same general area. I'm pretty sure that San Miguel and San nicholas have no triples,only doubles and singles while the rest have all three options. 
Last year I was in San Miguel on the scholars floor. Being scholars for didn't make a huge difference as a lot of people were still down to smoke and drink with everyone. I knew everyone on my floor. But San Miguel is not coed floors,  it alternates boy girl by floors. There was still mingling in lounges though and we had the same ra as fourth floor, who also stayed on the 4th floor most of the time and left us alone. San nic is another 8 story tower but it is arranged differently so it has coed floors. 
The other three are all two story coed floors, but there is still a little separation between genders. I heard nothing about santa rosa. Santa Cruz kinda has the chillers rep. And then anacapa. 
One of my friends lived in SC and was in a triple after requesting double. I feel like there are a lot of triples in the 2 story clusters and they also kinda look like swastikas sooooo....
It don't matter
Really I'm not too sure if it makes that big of a difference"
9622,"Oh god, I can't imagine that. I lived in San Nicolas about 10 years ago (depressing), the year before the renovation, and those rooms were *tiny* with just two people in them."
9623,I lived in San Nic 4 years ago and I can't imagine them stuffing three people in there. That's just inhumane!
9624,"Oh, my b. Never went in there too much and just expected it to be more like san mig which had none"
9625,Check out [UCSB Residences](http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences) for basic hall descriptions.
9626,"So the two story dorms - anacapa, santa cruz, santa rosa - have no singles or doubles this year because of the large freshman class. San Mig is all small doubles, and san nic has all 3 options. I dont know how it will be next year, but this year the class was so big that they had to do this on the three two story dorms. FT would have been the best bet this year if you were banking on a double tbh."
9627,"I was in Manzanita for 2 quarters and didn't like it. I mean the room was cool, the dining commons was good, but people weren't very social. Mostly creepy actually. My own room mate wasn't social at all. I was a transfer but he was a 4th year that lived in the dorms all four years. I moved out to IV after 2 quarters and loved it but I would choose one of the other dorms."
9628,I also loved ft but I've heard the construction has made it quite a bit less enjoyable
9629,The only kids I met at UCSB my freshman year lived at FT or would go hang out at FT with us every night because the on campus dorms were lame. You should reconsider
9630,"Look man. I'm currently a 1st year at UCSB and staying at Santa Rosa.

In my opinion - Santa Cruz/Anacapa are both good and equal. Then I'd go with Santa Rosa, San Nic, then San Miguel. I don't like how far FT is personally, but people do like it there too. Anyways, go with Santa Cruz/Anacapa."
9631,"Just letting you know, there is some construction happening near FT at the moment. I have no idea when it'll be done, but it's quite literally right next to the dorms. Most of the time it's not that loud, but it's a bit of an eyesore when you have a beautiful mountain landscape outside your window. 

Besides that, I am a supporter of the FT experience."
9632,"Live in San Nic, couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. Honestly you'll be happy anywhere, college is what you make of it. If you choose to get close to your hall mates, then so it will be. Personally San Nic is THE SHIT, and FT comes a close second. ;)"
9633,"Manzanita isn't very social, and has tons of 2nd, 3rd, 4th years who aren't very social. Pretty much all the other dorms on the other side of the lagoon are the same. . . 

FT is pretty fun."
9634,"Another plus for San Miguel. It's one of the older dorms but it's obviously the most central out of all of them, the closest to Ortega dining commons (best lunch if you don't like eating pizza everyday), and the floor size is perfect. With ~25 per floor you have just enough people that it's never empty but not so many that major cliques form. I was friends with everyone on the floor and with most of the girls on the floor above. They were all close too, because of the 25 per floor reason, so it was a neat set up. That being said, I had plenty of fun in Santa Cruz and FT as well, I just think San Miguel had the most pros going for it.

My biggest recommendation would be against manzanita or Santa Rosa."
9635,why would you recommend against santa rosa? I was actually considering that because I thought the Wellness LLC seemed interesting and practical. Any advice on that?
9637,Santa Cruz is the best of the chi-5!
9638,Anacapa gave me a great freshmen year.
9639,Me too :)
9640,"Current RA here. Here's brief rundown for next year. I'll separate it by area:

***San Cat***: Made up of two towers, south and north. Each tower is 8 or 9 stories. There will be construction, and no parking; but all the rooms are going to be doubles, which is cool. I lived there my first year and loved it. Portola is the best, don't believe the lies. You'll end up biking a lot or bussing a lot if you live here. The bike ride isn't that bad, and it keeps you fit. The rooms are suite style, so you'll have a two rooms connected by a bathroom. And given that it's only 2 people to a room, sharing a bathroom with 4 people is super chill. 


***Chi 5***: Only Freshmen live here and it's made up of 5 residence halls. Majoriy of the rooms will be triples. You'll probably eat at DLG or Ortega a lot. I dig Ortega, DLG is whatevs. 

* **Anacapa**: Shaped like a swastika, divided in the middle. Currently one side houses the scholar floor upstairs which is divided in the center by gender. The lower floor is non themed, separated by gender similarly. The other side houses the API (Asian and Pacific Islander) floor upstairs, and the lower floor is non themed. These are both separated by gender in the middle too. The gender separation is pretty much negligible though, as you're all technically on the same floor anyway, just different sides. Each floor has two bathrooms, a male one on the male side and a female one on the female side. 

* **Santa Cruz**: Probably similar to Anacapa, with different themed floors. Bathrooms similar to Anacapa I think. 

* **Santa Rosa**: Shaped like a really long snake. No gender separation. Has some themed floors, not sure which ones. Bathroom situation similar to Anacapa. 

* **San Nic**: Houses the students from the Freshman Summer Start Program(FSSP). Unless you do FSSP, I would recommend *not* choosing this as a top choice because (1) it will be hard to get because it will be mostly full already, and (2) everyone in San Nic will have already formed their friend groups if you do get put there.

* **San Miguel**: Tbh, I don't know too much about San Miguel. Sounds like the floors are single gender, which I think is less fun. I do know that there are more single rooms here though. So if you *really* want a single room, you can try to get put here. 

***Far Side***: This area mainly houses second and third year students, but some freshmen do live here. You'll eat at Carillo a lot, it's cool at first (brick pizza oven, pasta a lot) but I got tired of it fast. It's v carby, ""pizza, pasta, and potatoes"" is how my friends and I would describe it. Though I think a lot of first years in the Chi 5 tend to like it. 

* **Manzanita**: This is a ""village"" composed of 17 different houses. Some of the houses have themes, such as the Continuing Scholars House . Some are non themed. If you get a top floor room the ceilings are p high, which is [neat] (https://i.imgur.com/ZkYogmc.jpg). Single bathrooms, of which there are like 4 or 5 on each floor.  

* **San Raf**: I'm actually not sure if any freshmen live here at all...But I'll give the information anyway. It's made up of a tower and 2 clusters. A lot of it is suite style, so you'll have like a living room, bathroom, and several rooms in one suite. It's pretty cool  if you have a group of friends to live with. 

I personally think San Cat is the best choice. I loved living there and made so many friends. Portola is bomb dot com. The construction will be kinda lame, but I think current residents have said it's not that bad. 

Regardless of where you get put though, you'll have a good time if you make the most of it. I'm sure if I had lived anywhere else my first year, I'd be recommending that res hall to you. So go where you think you'll like the best. Also consider applying for a themed floor (formally known as LLC's or Living Learning Communities). They're nice because you'll be living with people who already have a similar interest, and so it will be that much easier making friends!

EDIT: Yes, I am part of the minority opinion that Portola is good. But when they're on, they're ON."
9641,Either things have changed or portola is definitely not good
9642,"Yea was gonna say the same thing, lol.  When I went portola was the worst and DLG was the best.  God I miss college"
9643,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure FT also has triples now."
9644,FT for sure has triples now
9645,"Yeah that's what I thought. They definitely still have some doubles, but the shorties have been mostly converted to triples."
9646,"It does currently, but next year the plan is for it to be all doubles."
9647,"I feel like this is the minority opinion regarding San cat... Portola is alright. Nothing fantastic, nothing terrible. Just lower your expectations and you'll be fine. And from what I've heard it can get pretty loud at night from construction as well as noisy neighbors. And for the bike ride, some of my friends hate it, some don't mind. Regardless it is a major inconvenience forcing either to rely on the bus system or to bike some ways away to get on campus. It makes anything other than class harder to attend because you wonder if it's worth the bike ride/hassle. Though Just my thoughts mixed in with what I've heard. I personally live in Santa Cruz and it's pretty awesome that we're in walking distance to the beach."
9648,"Hi, Construction hours are 8am-5pm Monday through Friday. There's no night construction."
9649,Is it a bad idea to take a longboard instead of a bike? Especially if I wind up living in San Cat?
9650,"FT is most social. 

Manzanita is most isolated. 

Everything else is in the middle."
9669,FT
9652,"Both Anacapa and Santa Cruz have been renovated. The biggest differences, I would say, is the distance from the beach. Santa Cruz is close to Campus Point by a few yards and that's really the only difference. 

And don't really worry about ""social"" dorms and whatnot. There's literally nothing you can really do about that. One dorm might be more social than another because of the people who are in it, not because it's that dorm. One dorm may seem more social because more social people may happen to live in that dorm that year. 

And don't worry about San Nic. True, a lot of people have formed friend groups, but a lot of people have not! A lot of people move in/out of San Nic after FSSP, so don't worry about trying to join a hostile environment."
9653,"If you're torn between Santa Cruz and Anacapa, here's some stuff to consider. Santa Cruz was recently renovated, and everything is brand new. It also has a movie theatre that is available to all residents, where you can borrow movies from the front desk or attach a laptop or an Xbox with an HDMI cable. Santa Cruz is also right next to DLG, the best dining commons on campus (not that Anacapa is much farther!) Santa Cruz is also closest to Campus Point, the most beautiful beach on campus (that is why I chose it.) Anacapa is slightly closer to campus; if you're riding your bike back to Santa Cruz, you always pass Anacapa. But beyond that, it really doesn't have any advantages. It seems like Anacapa has prettier girls this year but that's not important for you!"
9655,Good ole Anacapa.
9656,"You’re gonna be happy no matter where you are. Everyone wants to make friends and be social in the dorms their freshman year. 

That said, live in Chi- 5 or FT. In other words, your options should be San Nic, San Mig, Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and Santa Catalina (FT). You’ll make tons of friends in all of those

Manzanita is socially dead and a terrible choice if you’re a freshman. It’s all 2nd years who either have their friend groups or have social anxiety. Don’t live in Manzanita or San Raf as a freshman. It’d be a waste of your freshman year dorming experience. 

Live in one of the ones I mentioned above^ (chi 5 or FT). I did FSSP and lived in San Nic my freshman year and it was the best option for making friends. Everyone in FSSP is SO FUCKING SOCIAL, OUTGOING, AND FRIENDLY BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT TO MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS THEY CAN. 

FT is also very very very social and the best dorm if you like to turn up and party. By far the most lit dorm, although I will say it was rare to see people sober in San Nic on my floor. 

But tbh, all the freshman dorms are pretty similar. No bad option (except for manzanita and San raf)."
9657,"Depends on what you’re looking for. 

If you want to be close to campus the chi-5 (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, San Nic, and San Mig) are the way to go. If distance isn’t an issue then FT and Manzinita are an option for you. 

If you’re looking for triples all the chi-5 have them. FT has doubles and triples (I believe? But a lot of doubles I think). San Miguel and San Nic also have doubles. The shorties (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz) only have triples.

Some of the shorties have a nice ocean view, depending on which side you choose. The towers (San Nic and San Mig) have a lagoon view but it depends on which side you choose.

The shorties are 2 floors and the towers are 8 floors. 

The best dining commons from the most popular opinion is probably: Carrillo > DLG > Ortega > Portola or Carrillo > Ortega > DLG > Portola. 

The towers and shorties are close to both DLG and Ortega. Carrillo is a bit far from the chi-5, it’s closest to Manzi. FT has Portola. 

Personally, as a person that lives in San Mig, Ortega is my number 1 because of its specialty bars like waffle night, ice cream bar, curly fry bar, etc...

I think socially all dorms are pretty active except for probably manzi (because a lot of 2nd years and up are probably living there and already have their groups). 

Santa Cruz has a theater and their color scheme is whacky but nice imo. Santa Rosa is a bit older and the color scheme may seem a bit dull but they have a small fitness room. Anacapa has a somewhat brighter color scheme (sorry I don’t know much about Anacapa or the shorties aside from their color scheme). San Mig has a small fitness room too but the color scheme may be a bit dull. There’s also a thing about San mig having janky elevators but I haven’t had that much of a problem with the elevators. Sometimes one side is closed but I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. The only time it was bad was during the Thomas fire and people had to walk up to their floor. I’m not so sure about San Nic but I know students from FSSP stay there. 

I hope this helps and gives you some insight into the dorms! I know I was pretty stressed when choosing a dorm so if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"
9658,"Santa Cruz is really social dorm. I work there as DA (desk attendant), they have the F.Y.R.E floor (First Year Resident Experience) so they have a lot of social events. And they have their own theatre room, which is always a competition to check out. Lots of other stuff as well, but the Lead Staff is super social and cool with the residents too. I may be biased, but many other freshmen from other ResHalls always talk to me at the desk waiting for their friends saying they wished they had picked Santa Cruz. 

##**But just like anything else in life, it’s what YOU make of the experience!**

Edit: Santa Cruz was also just newly renovated as of last year."
9659,"Search bar my dude. Prob Anacapaca > Santa Cruz >= Santa Rosa > other dorms, if you want on campus. Ofc some people love FT, but some people don’t like it because of the distance. So opinions about FT (San Cat) can be pretty polarizing."
9660,Try a little searching first: http://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/search?q=dorm&restrict_sr=on
9661,"Pretty much everyone will tell you that whatever dorm they were in is the best one.

Except for Santa Catalina (FT), that one seems to be about 50/50.  To go with this though, the half that love it absolutely love it and the half that don't absolutely hate it, so depending on what half you fall in it could be good or bad.  Unless you really don't mind waking up early to ride a mile to class, I would just avoid it.

Despite that though, everything is going to be pretty similar.  Every dorm has parties, every dorm has chill people that don't necessarily want to party, and every dorm (except FT) is within walking distance of class.  Sure you might have to take an elevator or multiple flights of stairs down some of them, but that just means you get a cooler view.

I personally was in Santa Rosa and thought it was fine.  It's technically the closest to main campus (although the difference is negligible), and has a gym and a decent rec room.  Other dorms had slightly newer carpets and whatnot, but the furnishing is pretty much the same everywhere.  Any difference in room size is also negligible (they're all fucking tiny).

And a little unsolicited advice: whatever you do, don't buy the biggest meal plan you can.  The dining commons are the worst part of the dorm experience, and really the only negative I had with the whole thing.  Sure, you'll be fine with it at first (""All you can eat; FUCK YEAH!""), but give it two weeks and you'll be begging for another cup-noodle to avoid a dreaded trip to the DLG.  As the dean of students once told me: ""It ain't cheap, but it sure tastes like it is!"""
9662,Dining commons are far healthier and tastier than a Cup of Noodle. Even DLG.
9663,"I respect your opinion, and cannot argue as to the health side of the issue.  However, with that said, please do not take offense if I choose never to eat at your house!"
9665,"Definitely healthier. The only low quality of the dining halls is the meat which is to be expected. I work for dining services and disagree with you, having seen the ingredients used and how often fresh central coast produce and dairy are brought in. I am also a nutrition enthusiast and avid gymrat,  so I'm pretty knowledgeable on macronutrients and hardcore with the food I choose to eat.


I get access to baked sweet potatoes, fresh produce from the Santa Ynez valley, along with organic milk, and a decent piece of meat with every meal among other things. Can't complain."
9666,santa rosa was renovated so it has new stuff
9667,"As a freshman currently I think it's important to put it out there: ive talked to other year students and I've pretty much concluded that the quality of food in the dining commons is totally different from year to year. For example two years ago Ortega was good while dlg was shit, but this year it's opposite in the opinion of most freshman. Never heard anything good about portola though...which is another downside about ft"
9668,"I also want to point out that unless things have changed significantly, ""good"" is a very relative term."
9670,it's the closest and quietest
9671,HAH!
9672,"manzi’s super quiet and right by carrillo. There’s like 4ish bathrooms per hallway with one stall + shower inside and you can lock the door, so not communal (obv everyone uses the same bathrooms but you get a lot more privacy this way)."
9673,"Manzi is the best dorm and if ure lucky you can get a ocean view. It’s also right next to IV so if u come back from a party you don’t need to walk far af to get home! 

FT is 1 mile from campus and is def a raging dorm building."
9674,"FT has shared bathrooms between 2 rooms. Issue is that it’s a trek from campus (5-10 minute bike ride or 15-20 minute walk).

San Rafael suites are shared between a few people not too many. It’s closer to campus."
9675,"pretty sure all the dorms on campus have shared bathrooms

ft would be your best bet. the bathroom is shared between your room + the room next door the only downside is being off campus. ft is so far from campus but there’s a bus that takes u to campus"
9676,ft rages though
9677,it rages but the bathrooooms
9678,DONT LIVE IN SAN NIC
9679,ft/san cat
9680,"Aside from the singles halls, San Raf shares bathrooms with people in your suite."
9681,"Santa Catalina (ft) has a shared bathroom between two rooms. I believe all the other dorms have shared bathrooms among the whole floor. I liked the portola dining commons for the most part when i lived at ft. 

Ft has a reputation for being a “party dorm” but honestly i didnt find it much louder than santa cruz/anacapa and i stayed there a lot. it just depends"
9682,"All the dorms around Anacapa (San Nic, San Miguel, Santa Cruz) are pretty similar in terms of location/dining commons, you have the choice between Ortega and De La Guerra bc both are really close, and all those dorms are on campus so its super easy to get to class. 

FT aka Santa Catalina is off campus by about a 10 min bike ride, but it has its own brand new dining commons. Santa Catalina is also just a huge building full of freshmen, so I imagine it would be pretty easy to find friends and I can't see how it wouldn't be a lot of fun. You can't really go wrong imo, since all the dining commons are pretty similar."
9683,FT best dorm in terms of experience
9685,Fuck towers.
9686,"Aka Santa Catalina, it’s more like living in a hotel versus a “normal dorm”. U get ur own personal bathroom (shared with 3-4 ppl vs the whole floor normally) and live in either a double or triple. Downsides are a 10ish min bike to campus but for me I like that because it’s extra cardio. Portola is the dining common next to it and this year I think it’s easily the best one after eating at it for most of the year. Also look up “dorms” or something along the lines of that in this subreddit and you’ll get lots of threads on this typa thing"
9687,Thanks I might consider that now
9688,Just know that rain meant 99% of FT didn't go to classes; granted the rest of the dorms weren't all that much better about attendance during that mystic wet stuff falling from the sky either.
9689,All the dorms besides San Nic are pretty good
9690,What's wrong with San Nic
9691,"If you aren’t there for Summer Session, a lot of people have already made friends and aren’t as social as other dorms. It’s also the only freshman dorm on campus that hasn’t been renovated in a while so everything’s a little worse than the others. Rooms are also pretty small and mostly triples. About 1/8 of the building has a great ocean view though"
9692,"So I lived in San Raf as a first year this year, and I'm staying for next year.

Pros:

* Close to IV and campus. You can get most places in 5-10 minutes walk.
* The suites (in the main building) are nice. One bathroom shared by 4-8 people, and you get a common room.
* No triples AFAIK. It's all singles or doubles.
* It's really quiet. Very few fire alarms or loud parties waking you up in the middle of the night.

Cons:

* The ""suites"" in the mountain/ocean cluster don't have a common room, but you still get a private bathroom.
* Physics/engineering classes are on the opposite side of campus so it's a bit of a commute (but still only 10-15 minute walk at most).
* There's not that many first years, it's dominated by sophomores/upperclassmen. In my experience it's definitely harder to make friends with people from a different year.
* You are pretty removed from first year life/culture. 90% of first years live in the other dorms, so you might find it hard to relate to their experiences.

Overall, I'd recommend it if you're not interested in party culture and want a more quiet/relaxed atmosphere. It's definitely still possible to have a social life and I've made some great friends here, but it won't revolve around partying.

As far as dining commons, honestly, all of them are pretty good. I usually go to Carillo since it's closest, but I often make the 10 minute walk to eat at DLG or Ortega if they have something really nice on the menu. DLG has tacos every day."
9693,Most of the Mountain/Ocean clusters do have common areas. From what I've seen it's the suites with singles that do not have it.
9694,"Ah, guess I just got unlucky then."
9695,Is San Rafael the only dorm with suites? I think I'd like to live in a suite style dorm.
9696,"I think so, but Manzanita may actually have them as well. Highly recommended honestly. My best friends all live in the same suite and they have a shared TV, PS4, and Switch plus communal board games, water bottles, etc. It works really well. Next year my entire suite will be friends, which will probably be really fun.

In my case, I don't really talk to my suite mates or know them on a personal level, but we don't bother each other at all and having the shared bathroom is nice. There's really no downside to it."
9697,"First year here. I’ve lived at both FT and San Miguel. I think it depends on what you prefer.

The one thing I was worried about when I was moving to San Miguel was the community bathroom situation. But, it wasn’t that bad actually, because the bathroom does get regularly cleaned.

At FT, even with your private bathroom, if your suite mates/roommate don’t clean up after themselves, it’s no different than a community bathroom lol. Also, it can be really annoying at times when your suite mates forget to unlock the door.

Anyway, here are some pros and cons at least from my view:

FT: (pros)
-private bathroom 
-big study space(I really liked the Linda Vista room at my time at FT)
-Room size

-(cons)
-It can get pretty loud at night, especially with driving cars yelling “F**k FT!”
-Inconvenience (Bc FT is off campus, if you forget your hw/papers, you can’t just go to your dorm in like 5 min unlike someone who lives at one of the Chi-5 dorms)

San Miguel 
(Pros)
-On Campus (This is what I like best about San Miguel. If I wanted to take a nap, I could just go straight to my dorm. Also, Ortega and DLG are really near my dorm)

-Quiet(Even though a lot of people prefer the social aspect of FT, I like a quiet dorm:)

(Cons)
-Fire Alarms (lol) There’s been like 6 fire alarms, and there was this one weekend when an alarm went off on Saturday and Sunday (ramen/popcorn related)

-People rag on the elevators, but since I live on the first floor, I don’t use them lol.

Feel free to PM if you have any other questions!"
9698,Alright thanks! I was thinking about Anacapa but I'll check those out too.
9699,"Currently finishing up my first year in Santa Catalina dorms. Biggest complaint I here is the quality of food served here. I certainly agree the quality does not match up to what is on campus I can't complain. There's also the distance, considering San Cat is about a mile from campus but if you ride a bike you can get your exercise WHILE riding to class. 

San Cat houses the most freshman out of all the dorms so if you wanna be surrounded by your class, that's a plus. Oh yeah, we got a pool too."
9700,"I heard most freshmen now don't call it FT. We called it FT almost all the time last year! But FT was awesome. Can't beat the social life, though!

Also, fuck portola."
9701,"Do people still shout FUCK FT as they drive by? My friend lived on 5south four years ago, and we heard this 10-15 times/day"
9702,They did last year. I still do on occasion. Not quite sure.
9703,"Thanks! From what I can gather San Cat is great socially and room wise, but distance, food and pretty much everything else is sacrificed. Top 3 though!"
