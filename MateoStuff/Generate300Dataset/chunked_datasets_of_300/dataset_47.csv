15090,"I generally prefer contemporary romance. Alisha Rai, Alyssa Cole, Julie Anne Long, and Alexa Martin are great. Beverly Jenkins is a master. Christina Lauren's books are fantastic. (For the most part, these are all cishet romances. But Alyssa Cole just released a wlw novella as part of the Reluctant Royals series. I haven't read it yet but Twitter has been positive!)"
15091,"Nora Roberts, Catherine Coulter (both her modern and historical stuff), Judith McNaught, Juila Quinn, and Lisa Kleypas"
15092,Syrup by Max Barry is pretty good.
15093,"Have a pretty long list.  I like both paranormal and contemporary.  My favorite paranormal is the Afterlife Saga, original and long, 12 books, it's by Stephanie Hudson.  I also enjoy the ones that can make me laugh and cry.  The Blue Moon series is funny and a there are about a town where hippies got lost on the way back from woodstock.  The town is just as funny as the main characters and their love interests.  For steamy ones that are also paranormal the Discovery of Witches trilogy was amazing and I googled so many historical references while reading.  I also loved the sexy Chosen by the Vampire Kings and the Program Series by Charlene Hardnady.  The Sugartown series was also really good and funny as well.  So many more that I can't remember off the top of my head."
15094,"I also forgot Mariana Zapata - all of her books are great.  One of my favorites is called Bright Side by Kim Holden.  I smiled, giggled, and cried so hard.  It is followed by up Gus."
15095,"I'm reading a self-published (with all the typos and editing issues that entails) romance series in French right now, she calls it ""dramatic fiction"" though. It really needs good copyediting but the plot is PENG i can barely keep up.  I'm completely engrossed."
15096,"the french lieutenant's woman 

Very very solid read."
15097,"I will confess that I bash romance novels all the time. 

That being said, I love Jane Austen novels. Sense and Sensibility is my favourite and if I ever have a daughter, I want to name her Elinor."
15098,"Does Ada, or Ardor by Vladimir Nabokov count? I just read it and it was amazing"
15099,"The Sons of Destiny series by Jean Johnson. Not super popular, but the series over all is interesting if you can suspend your disbelief a little.

I’m also in love with Sherrilyn Kenyon. I love the Born Of series from her.

I also liked this older space series by Susan Kearney (can’t remember the name right now).

I liked Lynn Vihel’s (sp?) vampire novels.

Oh and an erotica novel called Venus Rising. I will reread it once every few years."

15103,"Oaks grow slowly but they are great for this.  Lots of varieties too, I like bur oaks. American sycamore is another great one, gets huge and has beautiful white bark. Both drop some stuff but it’s not that hard to clean up.

Edit: just saw Eastern Europe, better to research what is native"
15104,Copper beech.
15105,Beautiful tree.
15106,I live in a very similar climate. Actually it gets colder and hotter here. One of my absolute favorites from where I live is the American Sycamore. I'm not sure what's native around you but these are beautiful long lived trees. You can't go wrong with an Oak or even something a bit odd like a Katsura could be really cool!
15107,"The suggestions of oaks and copper beech are excellent. If you want a graceful tree instead of a shade canopy, a dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) is an excellent specimen tree that will also get large."
15108,"My preference would be something with a more gnarled look, and a more interesting trunk structure.

Don't much like trees that just stand up like candles :)"

15112,"I have a customer that is wanting a very identical thing done at his house. I don’t mind explaining how I’m doing it and pricing they agreed on. We’re in the southeast though so a lot different climate than Ohio. 

1. I’m installing Thuja Green Giants. 
2. Landscaping contractor nursery is where I’m getting them from. 
3. We are planting in about 4 weeks, when our temps down here average around 50-60. 
4. He has opted for a more dense coverage “wall” so they’re going in every 6 foot. 
5. My customer is about triple the length you want but if you put them every 5-6 feet then get about 8 trees. 
6. Size and price depends on your budget. My customer has opted for a 5-6ft tree to start, so he hopefully sees 10-15ft height in 3-4 years. Buying them at 5-6ft height he is paying $90/tree and $40/tree to install, including paying the price for the rental for a mini excavator. 

These are just my numbers for this specific customer in my zone, call your local nursery to find a good tree suitable for your climate."
15113,"Wow, that's great info.  Thanks!"
15114,"1. What kind of trees should I buy?
** You’re in OH. If you need year round blockage, then go conifer route instead of deciduous. 

2. Who should I order them from?
**Depends on your area. Size you pick. Delivery.**

3. When should I plant them?
**This should be #2. Whenever available and able to work the ground.**

4. How much space should I put in between each tree?

**Depends:**

• how instantaneous you want the privacy. 

• your budget.

5. How many trees should I get to grow a 40' long wall?
**See above. Budget and expectations will drive this.**

6. What size and price for each tree is a good deal?
**Depends on your local conditions; if you can work a deal with volume/wholesaler; size; delivery, etc.**


Basically—you can do anything you want, but it comes down to your budget. 

**If you buy larger,** you’ll need a crew and/or equipment to move say a 12’ tree with a B&B rootball. You’ll have your privacy faster. 

**If you buy smaller/ not a burlap root ball,** you can move and plant relatively easily, could buy more and have a denser hedge-like effect. But, the trees are smaller and will take years to grow to desired height.


**instead of trees** you could also go the privet hedge route. Fast. Cheap. Bamboo if you hate your neighbors and if allowed in your community.

EDIT: cleaned up crappy formatting on my part."
15115,"> If you buy larger, you’ll need a crew and/or equipment to move say a 12’ tree with a B&B rootball. You’ll have your privacy faster.

I planned on buying a group of seedlings.  When I googled the various sites that sell and deliver them they have small, medium and larger along with S, M and L prices.   Not sure what the advantage is with the seedling size. (should I call them seedlings?)"
15116,"Seedlings will give you privacy in 10-15 years, if they survive.

Best to go to a local nursery and look at their 6 foot trees.  These will cost you about $50 each but will still be manageable by one person.  They will give you privacy much sooner and have a greater liklihood of survival if you plant them as directed and care for them properly."
15117,"Yeaaahhhhhhh...

We’re not really on the same wavelength as OP, are we? 

Client: I want privacy! Budget is no issue. It’s $46.99 and I want it full by summer."
15118,"Oh, wow... that's the advice I needed.  

The sites I looked at that sell the seedlings gave the impression I'd have a thick privacy wall by the end of this summer."
15119,"Marketing is just like that... 

Poster below brought up a good idea if you’re on a limited budget. 

• Prep a long bed as if for a vegetable garden. 

• Plant annuals —like sunflowers —behind your “seedling” trees for the next decade. 

• Add in a couple of larger “real” trees in strategic privacy spots for **immediate** impact. $200-400 a tree

• Add more each season —or as they go on sale— as your budget permits."
15120,"Like peanut butter? Well now you can like more of it. Sunflowers have been used to create a substitute for peanut butter, known as sunbutter."
15121,I can't imagine any home grower is going to go through the immense work to make sunflower butter from seeds. It's like $3 a jar for more than you'd get from five hours of shucking seeds by hand.
15122,"Some plants can grow a lot in one season (like beans, sunflowers, morning glories, etc) but not trees."
15123,"If you want a faster solution, you might consider building a trellis and planting so quick growing vines. Depending on your growing area, Clematis and Passion flowers are super pretty.

I would check out this blog for an easy tutorial and recommendations of the right plants.

15124,Go to the Ohio Agricultural Extension Service website and do some research. Often fast growing trees are weak wooded or prone to disease and you can easily end up with a giant headache on your hands. Also know that crowding shrubs is a really good way to encourage disease and mean you are constantly pruning.  Have a little patience.
15125,How tall?
15126,12' or higher would be nice.  The taller the better.
15127,6 foot trees will grow to 12 feet in about 5 years depending on variety.
15128,"I have oleanders surrounding my property. They grow tall and fast if you water them. I think they are on the medium/lower end of the price spectrum.  

If you have livestock though, the leaves are poisonous."
15129,"Will oleander survive hard Winters?

I've never seen them anywhere except a mediterranean climate."
15130,"Leyland Cyprus

Have the local landscaper order them and plant them.

Plant them as soon as the ground can be worked.

Plant them about 5-6’ apart"
15131,You think Leyland Cyprus would be better than Green Giant?
15132,"I’m not an authority on either one, but I think the Leyland grows more like a tree, and the Arborvitae is more like a bush."
15133,People who live in snowy conditions need to be advised that arborvitae like to flop in snow and ice storms.
15134,"What do you mean by ""flop""?  

Fall over?"
15135,"Their branches aren’t as sturdy as, say, spruce or pines. Their branches and central core are prone to snapping in heavy or wet snow fall. 

I don’t know what the Midwest is like except for the Weather Channel pics showing snowpocolypse."
15136,I just moved to OH from NJ and from what I've seen the winter weather in NJ is worse.

15138,"Aspen/poplar/cottonwood. They're all related. They aren't wide, but they grow like rockets. Plant a few. They're cheap. They don't live long. 

Landscaping tip: odd numbers of trees always looks better than even numbers of trees."
15139,These are deciduous trees and will give very little privacy in autumn and winter.
15140,Ha!  Fair point. I'm in a very cold climate and no one needs privacy 8n the winter as no one goes outside.
15141,Towering poplars
15142,"Following.
Thanks @u/McNam77"
15143,"Bamboo. Bamboo Garden out of Portland, Oregon area is a great resource and vendor. Free shipping too"
15144,Gotta make sure it’s cold hardy and clumping or you’ll have issues in Ohio
15145,"1) Everyone uses privet round here.

2) https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=377

3) Go to your nearest trusted garden centre (if you say where you are geographically I can try to recommend) and just ask the staff.

4) Dunno if Radio 4 Gardeners' Question Time has a resource website, but this is EXACTLY the kind of question you hear on it."
15146,"Thanks! I've found quite a few UK sites discussing the a similar issue. Being in a semi detached house (should have mentioned that in OP), and the neighbouring house being in the shady fence side, I wouldn't want to plant something that would grow monstrous too quickly. Actually, I wouldn't mind, but they might. In an ideal world, I'd like to dig a hole and plonk in something big enough to block the immediate sight lines from the houses behind... but still kind of be cinsiderate to how it will grow. No real big trees in neighbouring gardens. Sizes are about 8x10m perhaps."
15147,"Well, pruning keeps things to the right size.

Of course, leylandii are very popular- we have some at the back- but you'll need to keep them aggressively pruned...."
15148,"Hazel.

They grow 12m max, and you get catkins which look nice and Dormice love them.

You could plant a Cherry tree on the other side if you want the two to be different. Also a tree that has a nice blossom, and they don't grow massive.

Field Maple is a good hardy hedgerow tree, but grows fairly large eventually. Pretty colouring in autumn though.

Kind of wish you hadn't gone with laurel, tbh. It's hardy but it grows damn big if you let it and it seems to be a primary spot for wasp nests in my experience! I would've favoured some traditional British bushes/shrubs like blackthorn, hawthorn etc all mixed up so you get some berries on them for wildlife. You could still do that if you don't mind mixing them and taking out a few chunks of laurel. If you got a good amount of blackthorn you can make sloe gin!"
15149,"Thanks for the tips! I will look into Hazel and cherry :)  Only really chose laurel for the back as I read it grew quite fast, definitely enough  room to mix in some of your other suggestions."
15150,"Nothing really likes the shade, or nasty soil. Would Clematis and a trellis fence work?"
15151,"Could work! Is there a limit on how high trellis can be set up? The fence is 6ft high. Suppose I wanted the trellis 3-4ft higher than that, could neighbours complain?"
15152,"Get an old galvanised water tank (you can clad it with wood or withies) put it up on blocks and plant bamboo, instant screening, Bamboo can be expensive, so if you know anyone with a decent clump ask if you can dig some up, it is easily split, and you can get some really lovely coloured stems."
15153,"That's a cool idea, thanks! Like the idea of the tank; presume to keep it from spreading like crazy?"
15154,"Only some bamboo send out runners, the rest is clump forming, they are all easy to split so you can keep increasing your number of containers over the years, I have quite a few mostly in tanks and old animal feet troughs, all on heavy duty castors, so I move them around easily, they look great all the year round, and I attach wren boxes to the taller ones. 

I'm always giving clumps to friends, so have a careful look at friends's gardens and just ask."
15155,"Buddliea grow quickly, have a good spread and get fairly tall. They grow anywhere and butterflies love them.

Or, try a Leylandii. Again they grow bush well and grow quite quickly. They can get very tall, so will need trimming every year."
15156,"Oh god buddliea can grow massive. My neighbour has one - it is now almost as tall as the house. I have to prune my side heavily about twice a year and it's a massive pain in the arse as it grows very rapidly in all directions (annoyingly, mostly towards my minidish).

In summer it shades out my garden plants, however it's not that effective at screening."
15157,"Not heard of buddliea, will have a read up on it. Thanks! Leylandii was my first thought, but I'd rather something I don't have to maintain a lot if possible. My parents had a big hedge of it, had a lovely time tasked with keeping it tamed!"
15158,"Hackberry: not a glamorous tree but hardy, large, and native. Walnut or butternut very pretty but attracts squirrels. Catalpa very very attractive, but  a bit messy.

Medium sized Birch is very beautiful and native. Ironwood is not so beautiful but small. Honey locust very beautiful. Buckeye. Kentucky coffee tree.

Small trees (because trees are challenging): Mountain ash. Pagoda dogwood: mine is 30 feet tall, very beautiful aspect. Hop hornbeam. Wahoo, more of a 20 to 30 foot tall copse.

All these are native to MN. Plant native trees, they provide a huge amount of habitat and year-round interesting animals.

adding: Oaks! large and messy but wonderful. Crabapple, small to medium and can be messy but beautiful flowers. Willow is beautiful but very challenging. Magnolia or azalea: extreme beauty, but challenging in MN climate. Note, plant trees at least 25 feet from house. adding Linden (dur! can't believe I forgot!) They are beautiful, medium to large, they can rain aphid honeydew but only sometimes."
15159,I’d veto the flowering crabapple. I have one and it loses its leaves in the summer every year. Something to do with a fungus I think? They’re pretty for like a week. And this year I missed out out on the flowers even because of a late snow we got.
15160,"I've got a flowering crabapple, and it does great. Beautiful fushia flowers for 2 weeks in the spring, and just a solid tree the rest of summer. It only gets to \~15 feet tall, and the fruit is the size of small cherries, so I don't have any cleanup. The birds take care of it all."
15161,Lol I have some resentment built up towards mine.
15162,"The fungus is called Apple Scab. It’s something that’s just around in our climate, you’re right, it’s best to avoid planting trees susceptible to it."
15163,It’s cedar apple rust and you need to spray the tree in the spring to avoid it unfortunately.
15164,Yeah. I’d rather cut it down and replace it with a lower maintenance tree. It’s not that big so it would be fairly easy to do. I just need to find the right tree to replace it. And I’d move it farther from my sewer line than the crabapple is.
15165,"I concur. I've been complaining about the crabapple in our yard for the last couple of years. Beautiful flowers in the spring give way to a summer of dropped brown leaves, a fall of dropped overripe fruits, and a winter of dropped brown leaves AND rotten fruits. It doesn't help that whoever planted it put it next to my patio. I've been suffering it to exist because the bees love the flowers in spring and birds love it as both perch and forage year-round, but I can't deal with the insane amount of mess it produces in my yard/on my patio. It's like...some trees are 4 seasons of beauty, crabapples are 4 season of maintenance and mess."
15166,"I gotta push back on the hackberry. I'm in Texas and have several hackberries on my property, and they are by far the ugliest trees I have. Very scraggly, and all of them have developed rotten places on the trunks. They drop thousands of tiny berries that turn into saplings in all my flower beds... the squirrels don't go after them, so nothing cleans up the mess and I'm constantly pulling tiny tree sprouts. Maybe things would be different in MN, but down here I certainly wouldn't recommend them.

Edit: this may also be specific to Texas, but after our big freeze this February, the hackberry trees are constantly dropping leaves."
15167,"I don't think the hackberry is right for your area

\-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtis\_occidentalis"
15168,"They're native to central Oklahoma about 150 miles north of here, and they're supposed to be hardy all the way down to the gulf coast. Maybe they're healthier in colder climes, but they still produce a ridiculous amount of sprouts regardless."
15169,"My first thought was ""birch clump"" but I'm so basic Minnesotan ;) Love these suggestions"
15170,Oh my gosh what a thorough reply! What should I plant in my very sunny yard in New Hampshire? Please and thank you.
15171,"Many of the same trees or shrubs, though check for local varieties."
15172,"If your yard has water or drain pipes, select a tree that isn’t known for invasive root systems."
15173,"Excellent advice, please take this into consideration before planting! My gigantic crepe myrtle (planted by original homeowner) eventually destroyed my sewer pipes. Granted, they were very old clay pipes so you hopefully will not have the same issue, but definitely look into where the pipes are and what they’re made of before planting near them. I found a way to replace them without having to remove the tree, but it was stupidly expensive."
15174,Saint Paul has a lot of old clay pipes for sure.
15175,That takes out Japanese Maples for sure.
15176,Mn redbud or pagoda dogwood. Both are well suited for that area.
15177,"https://extension.umn.edu/tree-selection-and-care/recommended-trees-minnesota#recommended-trees-for-southeast-minnesota-1275561

This is what I used. Lots of options to help choose."
15178,"I've got some landscaping software with 3D models of trees.  

I imported your picture here and I tried a few and thought [this one might look the best](https://imgur.com/a/AxgIUIC)."
15179,This one for sure.
15180,Yeah this is what this garden really needs 😂
15181,That’s some great 3D tech.
15182,Nah. That one will make your house look cheap!
15183,"I am surprised no one has recommended a redbud. There are all sorts of varieties.  For instance a red leaf variety like Forest Pansy would look great. 

If you do go with a large tree I would highly recommend an oak. they naturally grow with a great shape. I would not go with a maple for a variety of reasons."
15184,Dogwoods are nice. Japanese maple come in different shapes sizes and colors. Great in all conditions. My personal favorite. Wouldnt go with Chinese hackleberry. Some type of oak.  Or citrus tree fruit producing.
15185,"Japanese maple isn't typically cold hardy in zone 4, where I live and where OP lives. Maybe they'd survive with a thick layer of mulch in a protected area. Garden centers have alternatives that are similar style maples and cold hardy to zones 3 or 4."
15186,It would get pretty damn cold up there where OP is. Your correct. Beautiful trees through.
15187,"They are beautiful trees. Jealous of my zone 5 and 6 friends, which is more similar to the climate I had as a kid."
15188,I second the dogwoods! Lovely blossom
15189,Maybe some kind of conifer?
15190,"Dogwoods can be super fickle especially the pink variety and be super careful when planting Japanese maples as they will destroy your pipes. Both are beautiful but can be difficult. Bradford pears are beautiful, ornamental,  flowering in the spring. They have  no fruit to deal with. Easy to maintain and grow quickly as to make a nice shade tree. They grow in a nice shape also."
15191,"Bradford pear trees require regular pruning every few years or they are prone to split. They are not native, and they bastardize native pear trees for miles around. If OP wants a small shade tree without a mess, dogwoods, serviceberries, and redbuds are great options with a variety of leaf and blossom color. The root systems of these won’t cause problems with the lawn or foundation as they age."
15192,Sure they may need some pruning but I still think they are better than some of the other suggestions.
15193,"They’re expensive to maintain compared to smaller native trees that don’t need regular pruning. I see these trees regularly split out after a storm in yards where homeowners neglected to drop the $$$ to get them pruned regularly.  They’re also an invasive, ecological nightmare! 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/how-we-turned-the-bradford-pear-into-a-monster/2018/09/14/f29c8f68-91b6-11e8-b769-e3fff17f0689_story.html%3foutputType=amp"
15194,Geez everything is something!
15195,"I’ve only ever had terrible experiences with Bradford pear trees—had them in FL and TX and they’ve only ever grown in weird shapes, get diseases, and seem to die quickly and easily with fragile branches and brittle bark. Just had one cut down, it was dropping branches on our car and was diseased and damaged from winter storms. They’re overly popular ornamentals IMHO.

I’d go with Northern Acclaim® thornless honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis ‘Harve’), a seedless and quick growing legume with dappled shade, so it’s great for being in the middle of lawns (adds nitrogen and lets in sunlight), good for OP’s climate. Tuns a pretty yellow. Otherwise, a native like hackberry or service berry which looks pretty and works well there too and is great for birds."
15196,Same as I feel about Dogwoods. I think they can definitely have problems also. I have four in my yard in Ga . Planted them almost thirty years ago. They grow beautiful without any problems. I planted two pink dogwoods before planting a third white in the place of the other two that fell ill with disease. I have three Japanese Magnolias (Tulip trees) that are twenty-five years and going strong and gorgeous. The property had three beautiful fully mature pecan trees unfortunately one blew over during storms from Hurricane Katrina. I’m not familiar with hackleberry trees so much.
15197,"If you want a smaller tree, look into a blue beech. Native to MN and fun, different bark."
15198,"You have a really healthy lawn so I'd stick with pillar shaped trees around the perimeter (so many people on here complain they can't get grass to grow because of trees).
 
Maybe a wall of tall vertical hedge on the right side property line and to help balance that out another individual of the same type behind the sidewalk hand rail."
15199,Ivory silk lilac for a smaller tree with beautiful flowers.
15200,"Oak tree!

Or an apple or cherry blossom tree! Smack in the middle of the lawn! :)"
15316,Red maple
15202,"Looks like you have a wild assortment of suggestions here that don't help dwindle it down. Might be better to look around your neighborhood and scope out the trees that you think look the best, then dwindle it down based on the trees' nuisances (pests, disease, cleanup) and decide."
15203,"I would pick a column shaped one. It gives you the height, without the headaches of a big ass tree near your house like 'where did the sun go?'. 

Maybe one that flowers?"
15204,Look down the streets nearby and see.
15205,No tree as I like all the natural light. I have a oak tree and all the acorns that I have to pick up is a pita!
15206,"American mtn ash. Beautiful for most of the growing season. Good growth habits, shade, wildlife value."
15207,"Magnolia are awful, messy and when the flowers bloom they smell so rotten 🤢"
15363,Cherry blossom
15209,"I'd listen more to what you desire before anything. I'd ask questions on size, flowering,other ornamental a aspects, etc."
15210,"I’m in Fargo. We put a ginkgo in our front yard that is doing really well. 

Our neighbors have a several year old birch clump that is also thriving. That’s a pretty common planting around here that grows quickly and looks good even while young.

Whatever you choose, I recommend rabbit protection. They ruin so much ornamental vegetation during the winter time. We have a sweet 16 (u of mn cultivar) apple tree that is finally recovering from being eaten nearly to the ground (but above the graft)"
15211,"Redbud
Dogwood 
Cherry 
Plumb 
Maple"
15212,"Go to your state’s Agricultural Extension Service website and search on native trees. Read about the characteristics of trees that interest you. Pay attention to mature size, maintenance requirements and anything that might be a negative. For example, drops a lot of plant material throughout the year or has a lot of cones.  Look at images of the trees you are interested in online - you want something that is visually appealing. Where in your yard you plan to plant may make a difference ti your choice. There are some trees that give off chemicals that prevent other plants from thriving. Black walnut for example. Also, are you planting it to help shade your roof in summer and reduce your cooling costs?"
15213,"Yeah, just pay a visit to your county extension office and they will recommend a native tree suitable for your lot. And it’s free info! Win-Win"
15214,"Im thinking a japanese maple, or a nice silver wheeping birch. Both deciduous!"
15215,Japanese Maple
15216,"I disagree with magnolia at your location. Even in SE Michigan, many magnolias get hit by late frost or a warm spell in March followed by a frost. They are just too vulnerable. Star magnolia is the hardiest one, I believe. Serviceberry blooms early and you don't have to worry about messy fruit: the birds eat it all."
15217,"Hardiness zone 4 is good for most magnolias. I don't recommend it since it flowers early then doesn't look great in front of everything else after, but the climate is rarely an issue."
15218,Christmas tree.
15219,"Dammit, 2nd place again! I'll get you yetjjdawgs84..."
15221,I would go for a Magnolia
15222,Why add a tree? You’ve got a yard of the month qualifier.
15223,Magnolia. Not sure what direction your house faces though
15224,How about a Lindon tree
15225,Bur oak! <3
15226,Sugar Maple.
15227,Those columnar cherry blossoms to balance out the squattiness of the house.
15228,Maybe a nice dogwood?
15229,I'm seeing a tulip tree or catalpa.
15231,I like the idea of a dogwood but I'm a huge fan of Japanese maples - so beautiful.
15232,"I think your question should be what Trees. You’ve got plenty of room for a few trees, depending on what species you choose and where you chose to place them. Aspen, Oak, Kentucky Coffee, Honeylocust, Hackberry are all great shade trees. Serviceberry, Pagoda Dogwood, Blue Beech, Ironwood and Nannyberry trees are all great ornamental or understory species."
15233,"Red maple, cherry blossom, Emperor I"
15234,A Japanese maple 🍁 would give it enhanced intterest and color.
15235,Im a fan of nearly any fruit tree you like? It can be a pain cleaning up the mess or getting to it because animals but its worth it.
15236,Get a Japanese Maple.
15237,"Consider how much daylight you want to lose.  It looks like you don’t get much light on the sides of your house. 

I’d only consider a small tree for your yard or else I think it would overwhelm your home."
15238,A birch (?)
15239,"Check my Tree Project ✌️
Paulownia could be very nice for you"
15240,"I'm a sucker for the Red Sunset Maple.  Nice looking tree.  Low maintenance.  Turns to a beautiful red-orange in the fall.  Even the leaves eventually on the ground looks pretty.  Grows at a good rate, but won't overwhelm the yard anytime soon."
15241,"I'm from NZ so im unsure if you can get them there but white flowered Magnolia, very elegant tree with beautiful leaves"
15242,"I taught horticulture and landscaping and I have 2 ideas you might like: a) Spring impact with a Magnolia tree underpants with spring flowering bulbs (personally I like the King Alfred daffodils, tulips and grape hyacinth combo) or b) a grouping of 3 clump Birches planted as an island then UPLIT with white spotlights. I did this at one of my old houses and people always complimented it.  Even in winter it is striking. The Birch trees look good underpants with Daffodils and Vinca minor (periwinkle vine) or spring and summer bulbs and Gold Coast juniper which spread."
15243,Autumn blaze maple. Every time.
15244,Or a Genko
15246,A Smoke Tree!
15247,Don’t.  The house and yard are too small.  You will eventually block your view or the house could be overwhelmed.
15248,Willing or a cherry autumnalis rosea..very pretty and colorful tree in the spring and fall.
15249,Blue beech as a small option. Otherwise Bur Oak or White Pine if you want big
15250,Clump white birch
15251,"I like a cotton less cotton wood tree. Not sure your zone but they're everywhere, fast growing, shade tree,"
15252,Bradford pear
15253,Silver maple
15254,Shade may ruin the lawn. FYI. I’d skip the tree and just landscape more. Only my opinion…
15255,"Magnolias are good shade, great climbing, big flowers."
15256,"My parents house(the house I grew up in) has 3 of the biggest magnolia's I know of. 60-70 feet tall.  And they're so close to the house, they had to be limbed up to about 10-12 feet so the limbs wouldn't ingulf the house. But I can tell you, cleaning up the yard as a kid with those trees was not fun. The leaves are tough and thick and the cones are hard & spiked. And you can forget trying to get grass to grow anywhere near them. But they are all the things you say, but also a lot of work too."
15257,"Fun fact: The biggest magnolia tree in the world is in Old Washington State Park in Arkansas. After part of the tree was damaged and died (in a storm of some kind, iirc), it was *still* considered the largest magnolia tree, because it's that fucking big."
15258,Weeping willow
15259,They are the lava lamp of trees.
15260,"I sat here for a good 30 seconds trying to figure out what the lava lamp was in relation to.

It's a lamp. Right. I'll just hop on over to /r/drunk now, it'll be easier"
15261,I've been wondering for 4hours as well & still don't get it
15262,"Lava lamps are really weird lamps, just like weeping willows are really weird trees.

I think?"
15263,"The wind blows the wispy branches all around and they are considered tranquil and  peaceful trees. Kind of like how lava lamps are mostly just cool to look at as the ""lava"" floats around. Both considered a stressball for the eyes if you will."
15264,"Thank fucking god someone explained it, haha"
15265,"My favorite willow in particular is the one at the Elms mansion in Rhode Island.
http://i.imgur.com/ZruKSxk.jpg"
15266,Now that's a cool tree. Maybe the coolest willow I've seen!
15267,It look like it's hiding something!
15268,"It's actually quite amazing underneath. Climbable trunks, a few degrees cooler than the outside. Only downside is everyone who has carved their names into the tree."
15269,Whomping willow? No?
15270,###SHHH
15271,"God, how great are weeping willows, though??"
15272,"Oh yes, to sit beneath a majestic willow in dappled sunshine and watch the world go by! That's what life is all about to me, that is my life aim. I can't think of anything better."
15273,"Weeping willows are beautiful trees, especially when they are in your neighbors yard and not yours."
15274,"My great grandma had a weeping willow tree and she'd cut off branches and give to which I thought was cool.

I also have very fond memories of sitting under that tree and just doing random kid shit.

She also had a pussy willow which I thought was really neat since it was all fully and she had some old folk story that went along with that tree but I have long since forgotten what it was."
15275,Such a beautiful tree. For some reason it always makes me feel peaceful.
15276,Sequoia. Because holy shit.
15277,"[Album](http://imgur.com/gallery/tLQjM)

Yeah, they're pretty cool for how tall and grandiose they are. I prefer trees with a bit more character though. Sequoia is just tall."
15278,"Fuck me, that's a big tree."
15279,Ginkgo trees. I love the leaf shapes and how the ground turns yellow when the leaves fall. I recently took this picture on campus :) http://imgur.com/C9vGrxs
15280,But the smell when the fruits rot......sooooo bad!
15281,The female trees smell like dog shit.
15282,Yeah but they smell like  sweaty asshole when they're getting ready to bone.
15283,They are my favorite too as long as you have a male tree!!
15284,"Oak, a big ole English Oak. Aye"
15285,"Nah man, it's all about them Live Oaks"
15286,"Yeah big old knarly Oak. Good for shade, climbing, aesthetics. Love em"
15287,Are you a boy or a girl?
15288,"Mango trees.

I used to climb them to eat green mangos with salt. I was a weird kid."
15290,Sounds like my day-to-day life tbh
15291,"Most people online, carry a bag of salt."
15292,No there was a salt tree planted right next to the mango tree.
15293,Well that damn snail or its decoys could be anywhere
15294,That's like most Indian kids .-.
15295,"Same here, Philippines yo"
15296,Add some Chili powder and lime and you have deliciousness.
15297,"I used to climb grapefruit trees when I was a kid and eat grapefruit after grapefruit, letting the peels fall to the ground. The sickly sweet smell of rotting citrus is a really happy memory for me."
15298,We had a mulberry tree. It was a space ship that grew delicious berries in the summer.
15299,Green mangoes with shrimp paste is the shit though
15300,"Bonsai. My father has taken care of about 15 of them my entire life, and since they can outlive generations of families easily, I like to think he will continue to live on in them once he passes. I know after he is gone, there will be many days I spend out there, trimming the branches, having a nice chat with Dad. 

Edit: Im aware bonsai is a style, and that any type can become a bonsai tree. My dad doesn't just have 15 bonsais all of the same type, but I do agree it's important to be accurate. With that in mind, my favorite type would be the Californian Redwood Bonsai."
15301,I am 60 years old and have been growing bonsai since I was a teenager. I'm hoping my kids will take an interest in them before I die.
15302,"I've always been really captivated by bonsai, I tried to grow one from a seed and killed it :/ one day I'd like to have many bonsai and actually be able to care for them properly"
15303,"Bonsai is actually an art form and can be done to any species of tree!

I particularly like Japanese Maples, as the black bark with purple leaves is really pretty!"
15304,"Oh man, those are awesome looking, I saw one in a store once that had been taken excellent care of, so the price was incredibly high. But the colors are very pretty. I used to have a Carmona Retusa (also known as Fukien tea tree) but it died because I didn't take proper care of it, now I have a new bonsai, though I forgot which species it is (it looks somewhat similar, but it has no white flowers and the leaves aren't as pointed) that is still alive after about a year, although I really need to trim it one day, but I lost my bonsai scissors, so I'm going to buy a new pair in a few days."

15325,"Oh, this here person knows."
15326,Years ago I lived in a small community in the Southwest. Some of the  residents heated their homes with wood; cedar and pine. On calm Winter mornings the smoke would linger in the valley making my walk to work a fabulous experience. Thanks for the memory jog.
15327,Just thinking about that gave me chills. I would have never left.
15328,Douglas Fir. They remind me of my hometown.
15329,It's your hometown Twin Peaks?
15330,Doug Firs are pretty common here in the west.....
15331,Weeping willow. Grandparents had one growing on the edge of their pond so the trees remind me of all the time I spent there as a child. And I think they look neat.
15332,"Where I'm from, most people consider them a problem because they'll crush your water pipes to get to the water. A lot of houses in my old neighborhood got rid of them because they were doing too much damage to their pipes."
15333,"Japanese cherry blossom tree, the ones with really pink flowers and pitch black tree trunk."
15334,"Palm trees. They don't just grow anywhere, and are super pretty."
15335,"Except date palms, which drop their gooey fruit all over the sidewalk and it sticks to your shoes.  Fuck those ones.  Although their leaf patterns are actually prettier than other palms."
15336,Birch. Birch beer reminds me of 90s Fuddruckers.
15337,Yep .. Definitely birch

15367,"I was surprised too. Maybe because they're only found in a relatively small corner of the Earth. People also often get them confused with giant sequoias. Anyway, they're my favorite. Redwood National Park is straight up magical."

15380,"Birch trees. We had one in our garden and I often sat in said tree as a kid, learning to climb, making up stories, daydreaming. I loved that tree. 

It fell down two years ago. It was a strong autumn thunderstorm and the birch fell down with a crashing sound, just along the house - just a tiny tilt in direction and it would have hit the roof. It lay there, reaching up to the street.

I went outside to look and was so shocked that I broke down crying. Then I grabbed a saw and went outside in the rain and cut its branches, its arms in order to at least save my bike that had been standing next to it and was now buried. I cut my finger but the death of my tree was more painful.

Firefighters had to come and cut us a way from the house to the street, chopping my tree in half. 

We saved its wood and will likely use it this winter."
15381,The Larch.
15382,"I had a huge Japanese maple (still not that big), and a huge maple tree growing up.  The maple was great for climbing and the Japanese one turned bright red.   Incredible."
15383,"Cypress, without a doubt. It has a beautiful sculpted shape and smells sharp and fresh. Anyone who disagrees is a fool."
15384,"I've always wanted to walk through a Giant Sequoia tunnel, so I guess my answer is the Giant Sequoia."
15385,"Finally, something I can answer! From a Botanist's perspective, I'd say almost all trees have *something* unique and cool to offer, but if I was held at gunpoint and forced to pick a favourite, i'd have to say the *Iklypt Fisairn* better known as the Opal Lilly.

The opal lilly is one of the most interesting plants from both a technical perspective, as well as from a layman's view. It's an approximately 1.5m high ""flowing"" shrub and like its name suggests, each petal of the lilly resembles an opal, containing multiple, vibrant colours which can appear to shimmer given the right light conditions. This property led to their use in some of the most expensive dyes in older times, however this has fallen off recently with the invention of better synthetic replacements and other crops that are able to be cultivated and farmed more easily. The Opal Lilly was originally native to the island of Sri Lanka, however due to its trade, it can be found growing anywhere as far away as Egypt and the Middle east, which is where its other name, the ""Byzantine Lilly"", came from.

The most interesting thing about the Opal Lilly isn't it's flower however, it's its fruit. More specifically it's the method of self-nourishment that it uses to produce its fruit. The Opal Lilly is the only carnivorous plant in the world that also produces fruit edible by humans. It is not like a Venus Flytrap however, which is called an active Phyllagetige, the Opal lilly is a Passive Phyllagetige, meaning that it just sits and waits for the food to come to it. The reason for the flowers bright patterning is not dissimilar to the reason for roses bright colouration; namely that it is meant to attract as many insects as possible. Once attracted, the insects are enticed into the bulb well in the centre of the flower, where they are subsequently caught in a sticky, mucus-like resin. The insect is left to die and decompose inside the flower and it's nourishment is then absorbed through the stem recess (the part at the bottom of the bulb well connecting it to the stem). The plants produce fruit which allegedly taste of a mild citrus like a cross between a tangerine and a lime, which is consumable by humans. 

**Tl;dr** the Opal Lilly is the only carnivorous plant in the world that produces human-edible fruit. It might taste like a lime, but you're actually eating bugs.

EDIT: Funnily enough, my last comment was about botany too."
15386,"Wow. You, you really put a lot of effort into these fallacies, eh?"
15387,"> Iklypt Fisairn
Yup....damn,  I google searched and EVERYTHING."
15388,"Ok, you got me, I googled the flowers and was extremely disappointed in Google for a while..."
15389,"Well, as an expert botanist, posts on botany seem fitting...."
15390,"I like the Magnolia. They smell nice, are nice to look at, and they're easy to climb."
15391,Christmas trees
15392,"Weeping Willows. As a child I would always run up to a branch, jump on it, and try to swing back and forth. It never really worked out, but young me still loved them and tried again every time."
