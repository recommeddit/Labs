40324,ahhh ok I knew that wasnt quite the right term haha thank you for explaining more I appreciate it!
40325,Also grab yourself some decent ram. At least 3200mhz cl16 or faster. Even better is 3600mhz cl16.
40326,I am going to get the G.SKILL Trident Z Royal Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin RGB DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) Desktop Memory Model F4-3200C16D-16GTRS mostly for the looks but the performance seems to be decent too
40327,If you want to pay extra for fake diamonds on your memory than go for it.
40328,honestly 100% know im paying for looks but yes unless im missing a hidden spec that makes it not quality performance wise this is one of the few things I dont mind doing a bit more for.
40329,No the performance aspect is good.
40330,alright sweet thanks for checking!
40331,"Also consider crucial ballistix ddr4 3600mz. U got the looks, u got the performance, u got rgb for more fps, also low profile, for case clearance in case if you putting an aio at the top"
40332,What is CL....BIGGER number means it's better?
40333,"Exactly the opposite, the lower the number, the faster the ram. (Google: CAS Latency)"
40334,">why the downvotes you dipshits? 12th gen intel is buggy, pricey, and runs hot. I am providing sound advice.

12th gen is not ""buggy"" as there are very simple fixes that let games run just fine. This wont (And isn't even now just by turning off e-cores with the press of a button) be an issue.

Its not really pricey either. The CPU itself is the best price/perf by far and has the most upcoming upgradability (With PCIE gen 5, potential DDR5 upgrades down the line if you want to keep your CPU, completely new CPU architecture that will be adopted by AMD too, way more lanes/m2 slots/new gen usb ports/things you just don't and can't get for those cheap $100 B550 boards).

It also only runs hot under very specific scenarios that 95% of users will never run. Under gaming it runs better then anything on the AMD side most of the time, or at worst about equal.

Everything you said is fairly wrong. There's no reason as of today, 11/16/21 to be going with AMD and a 5600/5800x unless you are looking to save $100 and really cant afford spending the extra.

TL;DR: The $100 extra for a $200 z690 DDR4 board is worth the extra money. And the CPU is better at the same price range. And you get way better futureproofing. And it runs less hot at \*most\* tasks aside from stress testing reasons. And the ""buggy"" aspect is overrated and easily fixed and reverted once your done playing one of the 50 games that doesn't work (And will probably get fixed anyway)."
40335,"The 11600k costs $200 at micro center and I was able to get Best Buy to price match twice. I’d either save the money buying an 11600k or stick to your cpu budget buying a 12600k.

https://www.microcenter.com/product/633423/intel-core-i5-11600k-rocket-lake-39ghz-six-core-lga-1200-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included"
40336,"5600x! Higer single core performance and over core performance. Well u wanna get out of the debate? Watch videos from the holy grail, gamer nexus and all. Amd is really doing a good job with their cpus.

U will see YouTube is full of build videos all surrounding 5600x. Watch pc centric, he builds almost every rtx 3000 series around the 5600x. I mean why re invent the wheel? Why fix if it ain't broken? There must be a reason most youtubers who are into building go for the ryzen 5 5600x!

If u can find a good price, can evem go for a ryzen 7 5800x. I did, myself."
40337,"IMO, either a Ryzen 5600X or Intel **12**600K would do.  Here's a good configuration for both CPUs:

40338,"Much appreciated, also would there be any real benefit to trying for a higher price bracket or would that be just a waste (for an average gamer)"
40339,"For an average gamer I'd take the additional incremental cost that it would take to get a 5800X or 12700K and reallocate it elsewhere in the build, as boosting the GPU's specs would be much more impactful in this scenario."
40340,That sounds good. With the 12600 I shouldnt have any issues with it bottlenecking the 3070 right? Just want to check
40341,"I'd expect absolutely no bottlenecking issues.

The one thing I do have to mention about the 12600K (like all 12th-gen Intel chips) is that you need to actively make sure that the cooler you buy is compatible with the new ""LGA 1700"" socket, as it has different dimensions compared to Intel's previous LGA 115*x* / 1200 sockets."
40342,"Good to know ill make sure to watch out for that, I appreciate the help!!!!"
40343,"One thing to note is there are some places discounting the 5600x to 250, and solid motherboards can be had for around 100$, if you look. So there is a pretty decent price gap. That said, the 12600k is a fair bit more powerful, although neither will realistically limit a 3070 for years"
40344,"Running a 5600x with a 3060ti and it's not even close to bottlenecking it, I really don't think any of the CPUs you consider here will bottleneck a 3070."
40345,No bottlenecking but you'll need to spend around $600 for the cpu mobo combo
40346,"note, cooling not included there. the 12600k will need a beefy one, pushing it at least 50$ up."
40347,"I haven’t checked since availability went to shit, but the 1660 super usually fits well into a $1000 budget. 2060 can be made to fit as well. If you’re willing to stretch and able to find one, a 2070 super or 3070 is a good bet, especially for cp2077. I would use cyber punk benchmarks to pick the card you want, as that’ll let you know about what FPS you can expect with each card.

What are your other specs?"
40348,[This is what I have so far.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TLBKTC)
40349,"That's a seriously bad build for a graphics card anywhere near that budget. 

When using an AMD CPU with integrated graphics, half the GPU PCIe lanes gets bifurcated to the iGPU. As a result you have PCIe X8 going to the graphics card instead of PCIe X16. 

Ryzen G APUs are a generation behind. The 3000G is actually a 2000. The 4000G is actually a 3000. As a result, AMD jumped from 3000 to 5000 to fix this naming issue. The 3600 would be a much better choice for $7, the i5-10400 is a much more affordable choice with comparable gaming performance. 

For $3 more, I would recommend the Gigabyte A520m Aorus Elite - it has much better voltage regulating (8 stage vs 6 stage), a better Ethernet LAN, RGB, and full PCIe 3.0 support. (The B450 chipset itself supplies PCIe 2.0 lanes). 

With a GPU under $1,000, you can easily have 1440P performance. A 1080P 60FPS monitor is a bad choice. 

With the higher end GPUs in this price point, you would want a 650+ watt PSU. 

The best bang for the buck card currently is the Nvidia 1650 Super. The RTX 3050 (regular/TI/Super) will totally destroy this. Manufacturers are scared to make old graphics cards, because they will be seriously devalued with RTX 30 cards. Many 1650 Super models have been discontinued. 

It's basically a challenge to get any graphics card at a reasonable price right now. Trump added a 25% Tariff that started January 1st that doesn't help."

40352,"Used 1070, 1660 (super/ti), 2060"
40353,"You can look at used cards, if you don't care bout raytracing you could get lucky and find a 1080ti for $230-300 or a 1070ti for ~$180-230 you could go for a 5700 (XT) or a 2070 (super) if you find em for a reasonable price"
40354,"Look at something line this, but replace the gpu with a 3070 when it will be available at 550$ again https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/qzLrxr/modest-amd-gaming-build"
40355,"Best price to performance goes to 1660 super at $229, and the 3060 ti at $399. I think both models have seen price increases so I recommend waiting or looking on r/hardwareswap"
40356,RX 570/580 (580 is like 15% better than the 570) are great value and will be plenty for most 1080p 60Hz.
40357,How do the AMD cards compare to the NVIDIA ones? Never really looked at AMD before?
40358,I think the RX 580 and the GTX 1060 6GB perform similar but you can find the RX580 a bit cheaper. But the GTX 1060 is more power efficent while the the RX580 (and all the other AMD GPUs) have Freesync. Freesync monitors are way cheaper than G-Sync monitors which is the Nvidia equivalent of AMDs Freesync.
40359,Nvidia now supports freesync as well
40360,"oh wow i just read this while reading through posts, thanks im gonna try to activate it now!!"
40361,"Only on 10 series and newer cards, hope that means it works for you!"
40362,Ohh shit didnt know that. Thats great! Thanks for the clarification!
40363,"It's only ""officially"" supported on like a dozen monitors, but it should work on any -- can always google to find out for sure for a specific monitor :)"
40364,And what CPU would pair well with either of these GPU's. I was thinking the Intel i5 8400?
40365,I am not familiar with Intel CPUs. I have the Ryzen 5 1600. For Budget builds its generally recommended to go the AMD route. I personally would recommend the Ryzen 5 2600 or 2600x.
40366,"Get a RX580 8GB or GTX 1060 6GB, whichever is cheaper. Avoid the MSI Armor RX 580 mk1 (mk2 is fine)."
40367,What's the difference between the AMD and NVIDIA cards? I've never really looked at AMD before.
40368,"The 2 mentioned cards have about equal performance, but the RX 580 is usually cheaper."
40369,Rx 580 or gtx 1060
40370,"https://www.mwave.com.au/product/msi-radeon-rx-570-armor-oc-8gb-video-card-ac11196
I did a quick search and I think this may be the best value for money gpu. The rx570 is about on par with the gtx1060 3gb."
40371,"You should probably go for a 2060, but if you want to you can get a 2070 for around $750"
40372,"Is there a big difference in the 2060 compared to the 2070? 

I know alot of people say if you can spare the extra 100 bucks then get the better model. I'm just honestly a noob in the scene."
40373,2070 is around 15% better performance than 2060 is.
40374,Yeah beautiful 2070 it is and it's not much more expensive compared to the 2060
40375,"What is the exact budget?

GPU performance can be greatly improved with about $20 extra, so getting as close to budget as possible may yield the best results"
40376,Probably about 700 AUD.
40377,RTX 2060
40378,"Okay awesome. Thank you very much and sorry for my horrible grammar, spelling and newby information."
40379,What's your budget? And goals?
40380,Like 1080p 60hz or 1440p? 1080 144hz?
40381,Around 700 aud and I'd like to be able to get 1080p at 144hz?
40382,For the whole build or just gpu
40383,Just gpu.
40384,"So 500 usd roughly? I'm american, that would get you a 2070, or a 1080. Honestly any of those are good. They should be overkill at 1080p 144hz a 2060 or 1660ti would do you good if you wanted to save money"
40385,Yeah about 500 usd. Yeah it dont mind spend the little extra on the newer model just want something that's good and wont make me rage haha
40387,1660 s... wait he beat me to it. *tableflip*
40388,Obvious choice .
40389,Yeah. RX 570/580  might beat it price/performance if you find it cheap enough.
40390,"How about 1650 super? It's about $50 cheaper on Amazon, I'm not sure which one I should get."
40391,The performance difference is more than $50 worth.
40392,1650 super is a great choice but in OPs case he has more than enough money to get himself something better which a 1660 super is great for his needs. If you are in that type of scenario where your budget is very tight or you just need a new working GPU then 1650 super is a great choice.
40393,What resolution and refresh rate are you targeting?
40394,1080p 144hrz
40395,"If we're talking strictly budget, even a used gtx 1070 or rx 580 will be fine for all but the most demanding games. For the best bang per buck at $400 usd new tax included, **with stock right now**, probably a 2060 super. If you can wait a few months, the 3060 is expected to come out."
40396,"They're canadian.

For context, the 2060 KO is $448.97 CAD."
40397,1660 super?
40398,"Yeah, that or the 5600 xt if they don't mind dealing with AMD drivers. Although I've heard that they've improved a lot since launch."
40399,"Maybe I’m getting older, but I value my time more these days. It’s not fun to reinstall and reboot and google instead of playing games."
40400,"Don't blame you, I paid the extra premium for a 2060 over a 5600 xt because I really didn't want to deal with the drivers."
40401,"I swear the driver issues have turned me off from AMD forever. The only stable driver for the 5700 XT is 19.12.1, which is nearly a year old. I have tried every new release and experience constant system crashes. Extremely irritating for a $420 USD card."
40402,"$400... budget... half the cars I've owned in my life cost less than $400, so we must be thinking different. My take is that if $400 is not much money to you, you probably aren't concerned with cost."
40403,"Budget compared to $700-1500 GPUs. Also, OP mentioned a *budget* of $400."
40404,"OP lives in Canada, that's around $300 USD

For reference, my 8gb 570 costed $160, while a jug of milk at Superstore costs $6"
40405,"That's still not trivial though. Is the Corvette a ""budget"" car simply because Porsches cost more, or is $57k still a lot to pay for a car? 

I simply don't see the RTX cards as ""budget"" cards. Your 570 is a budget card."
40406,400 cad can get you a good mid-high range card. 5700 xt if you go used is probably the best you can get. 5600 xt or 2060 new
40407,"Unfortunately a new 2060 is *currently* slightly over budget. But it can easily become with-in budget with almost any kind of sale. And with prime days being rather soon he might get lucky.\

The 5600 xt Sapphire pulse is currently $383.99 on newegg canada so that would work nicely."
40408,"Seems like you can [get a 5700XT for like $40 more](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapclounge/comments/j2z0ba/fresh_stock_gigabyte_radeon_rx_5700_xt_gaming_oc/), which seems worth it, no?   Not sure how the Gigabyte version is.  I just heard to stay away from XFX."
40409,"That's usd, he's canadian. Gigabyte is great"
40410,"Unfortunately, that's in USD not CAD."
40411,"In my experience, the 5700 XT is an *infuriating* card and I can't recommend it. I have done a fresh install of every single driver and 19.12.1 is still the only one that works. Everything since then crashes every few hours, even while watching Netflix."
40412,That is a bummer to hear!!  Thanks for sharing
40413,For 400$ *Canadian* I'd recommend either a 1660 super/ti or Rx 5600 xt. The 5600 xt being the better performer but the drivers aren't as good/reliable as nvidia's. You *can* find sales on the 2060 which are around 400$ (Amazon prime days is soon so) and theirs always the used market where you might be able to nab a Rx 5700.(an xt if you're lucky)
40414,Does Canada have a different prime day? In the US I thought it was like July-ish
40415,"Hello, fellow Canadian. I've been doing a similar build for a new system (my motherboard recently died and it's time for some upgrades). 

Also from Canada. I bought this: https://www.amazon.ca/MSI-Radeon-RX-5600-XT/dp/B08CKDLN91/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=ox_sc_act_image_2&smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB

5600xt with the 14gbs memory. I understand that there could be some driver issues but for the price it seems like a deal. For context, the 1660 super is going for $300 to $350 and the 2060 seems to start at $400. $350 for the 5600xt which is supposed to have 2060 like performance, seems like a deal to me."
40416,"Everyone here is saying 1660, so I just thought I'd add this. Great prices on full warranty GPUs. 1660s starting at 200USD

https://www.evga.com/products/ProductList.aspx?type=8&family=GeForce+16+Series+Family&chipset=GTX+1660+Ti"
40417,Not bad unless they need to RMA and have to ship across the border.
40419,I've got the R5 3600 and paired with the Sapphire Pulse 5600XT (300USD) it will do 1080p 144 fps in almost any game at high settings. Easily get over 144 fps in modern warfare at everything high and around 100 in Warzone at everything high. It's a great card and definitely worth it from my experience. If you need fps for any other game just reply with the game and I'll tell you what I got with it.
40420,"If you can wait a year max, then 3060. If not, then 2060 or  Rx 5700."
40421,3060 will not be released in 2020
40422,Yea I said a year
40423,Yeah the post says “what’s the best budget GPU in **2020**”
40424,"Thats why i said if you can wait, and thats why i gave another option if he cant wait."
40425,Sorry bro but you gave him an option that literally doesn’t exist in any shape or form. Might as well have told him to wait for RTX 4000 series
40426,"You’re right, I could’ve told him to wait for RTX 4000, and I’d still be more useful than you. I could explain why the 3060 WILL be coming soon, but you don’t seem interested, and you’re definitely not worth wasting the few minutes I’m going to spend explaining the leaks."
40427,"Nah, I’m not interested"
40428,"3060 hasn't been even confirmed tho.
 It's possible Nvidia doesn't make one."
40429,Its pretty much confirmed. A lot of leaks showed it.
40430,"They released the 2060, they'll release the 3060."
40431,"Just get a 1660 Super or if the 2060 Super is under 400 in Canada, get it. 

Don't buy a 5600XT unless you're willing to do all of those driver installs and updates. This year alone had a ton of updates from AMD's side for their GPUs.
(Also, Nvidia cards are more efficient than AMD)"
40432,PowerColour and Sapphire have the best 5600XT drivers by the way. Those are exceptions to this rule.
40433,"Agreed, but I hope it's available in his location. In India, meh, NOWHERE TO FIND EM :((("
40434,"TBH if you’re not a Western Country, good luck with finding good higher-end GPUs. I’ve heard that most are horrible, and India is actually one of the better ones. Coming from Brit btw"
40435,"Yep, it sucks. Especially for peeps like me who are into SFF PCs but they are WAYYY MORE expensive than their US prices. Import is also not an option cus that's freaking expensive. Plus, India has some shit taxes of it's own that hike the price up by upto 25%."
40436,"AMD is announcing new cards October 28th, no idea on the price points yet. Answer could change by then."
40437,"Smart man, the prices are off the charts now"
40438,GTX 1660 Super for $230. Paired with a Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB 3600 speed 16 cas RAM gets me a stable 75 FPS max settings (except RTX) while playing Modern Warfare.
40439,"Sorry for responding to a 4 month old post, but what do you get when playing a more demanding game like Warzone?"
40440,"I mean it feels pretty much the same as Modern Warfare, which was the stable 75 FPS at max settings except the RTX feature (since it's a GTX videocard). I specifically have a 75 hz monitor so I've never tested going above 75 FPS since I wouldn't be able to notice it"
40441,"A used RX480 8Gb can take you a long way as you can find some for around 100$, but that's about cheap GPU, not really in your budget in a way.

A 5600XT or 1080TI would be your best bet, at around 300$ used. Don't forget to get some thermal paste and thermal pads in case you want to buy used, so you don't run in any overheating issue. 

Or wait for a sale on a 5700XT."
40442,1660 super is great
40443,my guess is to buy an used rtx or a 1080
40444,Yea I'm pretty sure I'll be going with a Newegg refurbished RTX 2060 for 410$ CAD
40445,Congrats mate! i have a 10 year old pc with 1050 ti on it :P
40446,1650 super
40447,You can get a used 2070S for $400.
40448,I would do this. There’s going to be a ton of used RTX 2000 series for sale here real soon.
40449,"1660 TI for $379.99 @ Canada Computers.

https://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=43_557_559&item_id=135364

40450,"The best GPU in 2020 is the Nvidia 3090.

Now to answer your question, 2060 ko or rx 5700. Or wait for the 3060 though it has not been announced yet. https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-release-date-price-news-and-features"
40451,Best budget GPU =/= Best GPU
40452,"Oh right, I misread the title. Guess I was more tired than I thought."
40453,"Unfortunately, the 2060 ko and rx 5700 are slightly over budget for them. Remember, they're Canadian so expect prices to be higher compared to US prices.

All that being said, I'd recommend the 1660 super/ti or 5600 xt at that price range. Thats not accounting for Sales/used prices though."
40454,Those are two great recommendations then considering the budget.
40455,3070 no doubt once its on the shelves
40456,3070 is going to start at  $499. That's not budget
40457,"Maybe. 

But if you scale it down to power/dollar,  i doubt any card beats it in value. 

If you can save to buy a budget pc, you can save to get the best value. 

Whats the point of budget, if its obsolete shortly, and you need to make another budget purchase to replace it? 

Saving the 500 for the 3070 is the best choice. And save another 500 for every other component combined. 

50% of a builds budget should be gpu, 50% for everything else. 

1000 is a respectably budget friendly build cost. Not the lowest, no. But far from the highest. 

A 3070 will carry the build many years into the future. Can a ""budget"" card do that?"
40458,"50% for GPU? That'll make the rest of the parts much inferior than the GPU.

Bruh, 30-40% for a GPU is ideal. The rest should go for everything else.

And when someone says ""budget"" build, remember this: ""Every single dollar that can be saved will be saved."" Suggesting him to wait for a 3070 is a wrong call cus by the time it'll be available for purchase, it'll already be out of stock (sad reality). And none of the cards rn are going to be obsolete anytime soon. There are people who still use the Pascal Nvidia GPUs till date without feeling left out as ""obsolete"""
40459,Are you buying for us? Did you post this from the deck of your yacht?
40460,"You might find 1000 is a lot less money than you think. 

You might find that 1000 is a lot closer to 100 than you think. 

Oh, you can manage 100 for your build? Might as well save till its 1000."
40461,What's your price point.
40469,$200 - $300
40463,I'd look into a used gtx 1080 then because there are some good priced ones under $300 and that gpu performs the same as a 2070. The good thing about the 30 series cards are all the pascal cards are becoming really cheap so if I were you i'd get a gtx 1070 or 1080. gtx 1070= gtx 1660 ti and 1080= rtx 2070.
40464,Price point?
40466,RX 580 maybe (I don't remember the exact price)
40467,Used market if you're patient. 2070 super under $300 would be decent. New markets a joke
40468,Budget first and foremost.
40470,3070
40471,"Hm, 3060Ti? Pretty damn good value (AT MSRP)!"
40472,i think the 1650 and RX 570 also worth their price.
40473,"well considering the 1650 right now is 350-400 id disagree. Also the rx570 was 100-170 now its 250-400 so again, id disagree. No GPU right now is good value unless you get lucky. Its insane how much these GPU costs right now. 1050ti should not be 300 bucks. You cant get 60fps 1080p on low with that card unless its a game from 2016 and under. 1650  is not much better. Im sorry but 300-400 and id just go get a damn ps4 or hell a ps5 if you can find one. Building a pc also requires other parts so in the end you will be paying 800-1000 bucks for ps4 pro performance yeah no fucking thank you."
40474,"The mid tier GPU usually have best performance per dollar standalone. But if you factor in the entire cost of the system, the value changes.

RTX 3060 Ti is currently best performance/dollar for a new GPU.

But for buyers you should only buy what you need (and maybe a little more) as extra GPU horsepower is going to waste if you dont use it. And if you buy too low, it can compromise your gaming experience so you might as well fork over a little more to hit your performance expectation, even if what you end up buying wasnt the best GPU in performance/dollar."
40475,">RTX 3060 Ti

they are selling for 1500 dollars now"
40476,this is due to scalpers still on the prowl? right?
40477,Of course it is. Seems thats the reason everything in tech is skyrocketing in price
40478,How  about know
40479,"none. im from the future, if you have any graphics cards, save them. even extremely old graphics cards are worth 100$ and theyre expected to be worth more later, and something like an rx 470 is worth 450$, also expected to be worth more. other stuff is also expensive, but especially graphics cards."
40480,Gpu mining is already dying so we might see the oppsite
40481,"It's not about mining, there's a literal shortage of microchips in general."
40482,"Mining plays a big factor, miners wants to sell their cards before they mine less then they can sell them for in 12 months. I can already see in my country that cards are being sold way cheaper on websites like ebay."
40483,the prices are really bad now
40484,Any you can get
40485,"Bro if 100-200 dollars is your budget for your pc rig in 2021, you already playing a game so why need a graphics card."
40486,"It is absolutely beyond me watching PC gamers duct tape two dollars to a subsandwich and then cry on it and say to themselves "" Here it is, heres a hail mary, maybe somebody will hear my cries."" and they throw the sub it cries tears of the pc gamer and somewhere along the way a lone pedestrian hears these cries from the sub as it flies by, and this complete stranger comes and works 55 hours with OT just so this pc gamer can finally rest and play on the 2060 acquired from working hours.

It is flawless how much of the Pc gaming community is broke on cue.

Like should Dr.Disrespect hold a seminar on Finance so you can all be reached equally at one time? orr??

Maybe you should go pick up some hours like the guy who just bought a 3060ti for whatever price for whoever cares.

All i'm saying is all this time spent on micromanaging low performance graphics cards and just pick up some extra hours, get an extra job possibly, sell some stuff, i dont know figure it I dont care clearly but my god you guys, lolol.

I've been reading threads on like budget gpu's and shit and its like bro I really dont think its the price of GPU's lately, taking into consideration of bots, miners, shortage, it's like broooo you shouldnt be pc gaming lolololo.

Like all these broke ass dudes like what are you fucking doing, Im not saying you cant have fun and that everybodys got fat stacks, but if you dont have the mobility to get a good graphics card financially....????

I'm just confused because I really think my priorities are vastly different than what im seeing.

I thought Pc gaming mid tier was like the toyota of gaming and ya'll acting like you cant buy a cv axle, you should probalby get some shit together?"
40487,Did you really even read anything about the state of GPUs and other PC components as of the last year? cause clearly everything is marketed way above MSRP which is why people are saying don't buy now since it is literally a waste of money to buy a low - mid range GPU that is way too overpriced.
40488,"My whole argument is why are broke ass dudes even pc gaming.

Go work and get the money so you dont have to cheapen your experience, even in the plight of a downturned economical stalemate"
40489,GPU's are up to 3x more expensive than before ain't no crazy person gonna fish out 400 dollars for a 1050ti and most people would rather not spend 800 on a 1650 so that's why these questions exist :/
40490,Why is this guy above even gatekeeping a hobby? All sorts of peoples with different means are allowed to build a machine... Lol
40491,"If being real is gatekeeping rock on.

Trust me im not expecting the gaming community to have financial reasoning, when ya'll whine and moan about gaming rigs when you cant save a thousand dollars if your lives depended on it.

Like you don't understand that the 15 minutes is up on the whole graphics cards are expensive, everyone understood the conditions of why, and the market has moved on....

Especially the secondary markets.....

If you cant manage to find a good deal under 700$ on a 2080, 2070 super, or 3060, I dont know what you want.

A fucking small violin to play while we caress your foreheads and comfort you through the fact you cant buy a 3060 for 350$ and have to pay double for something you couldnt produce if your life depended on it?

Pc gamers have become the most entitled little rat face creatures...

Thats why i fucking said get the money or shut up.

If your so smart why dont you produce graphics cards and ship them worldwide and solve all the future problems of all microchips for everybody.

Sitting around and whining about prices doesnt change the fact someone is getting a deal right now on a graphics card that you're all MSRP crying about."
40492,"Idk, sometimes there are other priorities (like a house and kids). But saying broke-ass people can't game on a PC, when there are still millions of people playing software like RuneScape or Warcraft 3, seems a little silly. The PC I built for gaming in 2002 with a mix of new and recycled parts could run software like that. There are YouTube channels even dedicated to building ""new"" capable gaming machines out of used hardware. Like any hobby, it can be approachable for many price points."
40493,"I didnt say Broke ass people cant game on PC, at all, not once

Go read what I said again.

Ive said this like 6 times now, what is so difficult to understand!

I said Broke ass people shouldnt PC GAME if their main motif is to complaining about the price of equipment they cannot make and they cannot make the means to an end, I.e get the money, get the extra hours, extra job, whatever they need to  to figure out how to buy something.

Even in the midst of a economic downturn affecting the markets.

The problem is PC gamers don't have priorities 70% of the time, its just to mindlessly game, and mindlessly attain the next best product, theyre never content and by far the most entitled group of people you will ever meet.

Oh and theyre all broke by doing what i just said, but having no savings afterwards.

They get just enough to buy everything to have nothing in their bank account.

My WHOLE point is priorities. If the last of your money would go to pc gaming but you figure that will hold you through going to work, coming home, and saving the losses made on buying pc rig's.

It's just like stop, stop stop stop stop stop stop stop.

Go find hobby while you can save money and be financially secure, and THEN have surprlus money to buy a graphics card or a whatever.

who says you have to pc game, who says you have to game at all, who says you cant just go enjoy nature trails, or growing food, or a garden, or go travel, or go cycle. People go do all those things and arent spending their last 15$ on it, theyre people of utility and sound ideas because its them that made their financial decisions a priority and not their pleasures.

Nobody cares if you dont have enough money for something, nobody cares how much the price of something rises, everybodies dealing with it.

Just so someone can play Red Dead 2 maxed out in 4k doesnt mean shit to anyone who's actually saved a dime.

People just look down at folks like that and it is what it is, try and change it and youre just gonna run into yourself.

If theres a problem fix it, if you cant stop complaining"
40494,Dude you must be a blast at parties
40495,I see absolutely nothing wrong with somebody picking up a hobby on the cheap. But I do get your point on stop having unreasonable expectations. but you can get a way lower end graphics card then a 2080 as listed and still be perfectly happy. Not everyone is wanting the best of the best just to play a game on a computer once in a while.

40501,What the Nazi fuck is this comment 😬
40502,Any founders edition gpu from an official vendor.
40503,"If you're looking for a $100-$200 dollar budget gpu, the Ge-Force 1030 2gb the best I've seen for that price range right now, just make sure its GDDR5 and not GDDR4. 

If you have a couple hundred dollars more then 1050ti would be even better."
40504,"Something like a gtx 1660 super, but they are so much more expensive than they should be. I recommend using a stock checker and follow that for a few days/weeks and see if you can get a decent deal"
40505,Sadly that there is no true budget gpu in bitcoin pandemic.
40506,"needing to upgrade my old GTX 970 but all gpu's are insanely priced or not in stock everywhere.
1070ti, 1660 super, rtx 2060... all at insane prices.
looks like ill be stuck with my old 970 until it breaks (which its already kind of doing) .... RIP"
40507,"I would recommend the rx 480 4gb I've been seeing them from around 200-250 dollars on used websites like ebay, offer up, and FB marketplace (rx 480 4GB out performs the rx 570 4gb)"
40508,I got a used 980 ti for a pretty good deal
40509,"With the current shortage i'd say gtx730 or maybe a 1050ti, nah just kidding maybe a 1660 super or an 2060"
40510,"I only have $200 budget, but the 1050 TI is so overpriced.."
40511,"I find it more helpful to think in terms of resolution and the ability to drive a specific refresh rate.

* RX580/1650 Super/1660 Super -1080p 60hz to 120hz (depending on game, settings) - Older or less demanding VR titles
* 2060 Super/5600XT - 1440p 60/75hz or 1080 120hz to 144hz - Will deliver consistent VR performance *without* supersampling.
* 2070 Super/5700XT - Some 4k gaming, 1440p 120hz, 1080 240hz, Supersampling in VR
* 2080 Super and above - 4k ultra details or higher than 60hz, 1440p 120hz+, 1080p *why the fuck would you buy this to play at 1080p*, Supersampling all the things in VR"
40512,Mid-range starts with rx 5700/2060 imo
40513,"Oh I see, so that means for example that the 1660S/RX590 is entry level/low-range?, then RX5700/2060 mid and 5700XT/2070 high-range?"
40514,Yeah
40515,"you can go by

1. price
2. 2. overall performance
3. performance in resolution 1080p, 1440p, 4k

pick any or a combination of these"
40516,"I would consider 5700xt and 2060s midranges.   (1440p)

RX580, 1660 budget. (1080p)"
40517,"2080ti, but a Titan V is much more reasonable :)"
40518,"The hard truth:

RTX 2080/2080S will be mid range when RTX 3060 drops"
40519,"From what I gather, Brand new I would go with 1660ti just under $300 and the 5700 around $330-$370. 

I would make the push to go with the 5700 if possible. 

2060 is around 5700 price but 5700 seems to be much better. Unless you are going for raytracing, which the 2060 does have."
40520,"> From what I gather, Brand new I would go with 1660ti just under $300 and the 5700 around $330-$370. 

1660Super should be good too, not that far from 1660ti, but also cheaper."
40521,"True, that's actually what I am going to get soon. The value is just too hard to pass on."
40523,"I would say it's a no brainer to go for the more powerful card and ignore noise, etc, but I also say that you should avoid blower models and get the Gigabyte 5700XT on the cheap end or Nitro+ on the high end. This is all coming from the perspective of keeping the card for a few years though. If you're gonna replace it in a year or two then get whichever is cheaper."
40525,Put the computer in another room and invest in some longer cables.
40527,"Since you're not renting, just put a hole in the wall and place the computer on the other side."
40528,Get a good 2060S then if you won't be gaming on it much since those would run quieter I'm sure. EVGA is imo the best Nvidia card partner so I would suggest their 2060S offerings.
40530,"If both cards are idle, do you REALLY think you will hear the difference? Over my 20 years of PC gaming, I can't recall where I said: ""\*\*\*\* this card is loud during idle"". Can you please link me to this noise test?"
40531,"Some variants in idle, eg MSI Gaming X, stop fans altogether."
40532,Almost every single gpu nowadays has 0 rpm mode. Meaning the fans wont run unless you're actually putting stress on the gpu.
40533,If you're worried about that just tweak the power and fans of the gpu for a profile dedicated to when you're running Ableton or whatever you use.
40534,Given that most aftermarket GPU has a fan stop mode when idle I don't think it's a major issue anyways. Unless your music programs uses gpu for some reason. I would probably be more worried about coil whine.
40535,"Yea you're right, that also something to consider. 5700 does seem to run hotter."
40536,I've been looking to buy a new system and was looking a lot at benchmarks on yt and can confirm that the 5700xt is comparable to the 2070s the fps differs 3-7 in some occasions 10 fps. But then it depends if you want that raytracing tech or not I personally don't need it cause I still think the raytracing tech is in its baby shoes so price/performance yeah a 5700xt makes more sence
40537,"Rx 5700xt user here, I'm not sure how comfortable I am recommending it. I'm an AMD fan, but since moving from the 1060 to the rx 5700xt I've been having issues left and right. Overheating, not performing well without uv, constant settings resetting, unresponsive black screen resulting me to hard restart PC, strange artifacts in some games, feels like it's not optimized well for games, driver updates don't help and sometimes brake more stuff. I wanna love it so, so bad and I still do, but I can't recommend it at its state, a card shouldn't bother you. It should plug and play, my 1060 did and I'm very confident the 2060 would aswell."
40538,I wish people wouldn't even mention ray tracing on any nvidia card below a 2070 super. Unless you want console level framerates turning it on is a horrible idea for all the low/mid range nvidia cards. No one should consider ray tracing when buying a mid range graphics card.
40539,Or streaming with 2060.
40540,I have a 1660ti. Pretty solid.
40541,5700
40542,"$300 is a tricky range because the performance of the 5700 flashed at $330-$360 is absolutely worth the price difference but I'm not a fan of recommending hardware outside of people's requested budget.   
  
What I'll say is if you're willing to consider used:  
$300 or under go used and try to get a 1080 or Vega 56/64 because those will stomp the 1660 or 1660 Ti hands down and AMD RX 590 is laughably not worth $275.  
  
If you can squeeze another $30-$60 try to grab a 5700 or 2060 Super.  
I hate to say it but new GPU's under $300 just don't cut it right now. The 570 8GB if you can get it at $100 is the only good value under $300 IMO."

40546,"No point in $280 1660 Ti since 1660S has basically the same perf for ~$250. For $300 I would go for a 2060 first but if a 5700 with a non-stock cooler was available I’d see if my case had room for it (they are pretty large) and just hope the drivers improved over time.

40561,Greetings from RDR2
41398,"One more for piano 
Here's what Dizzy Gillespie said about it:

**Learn to play the piano, man, and then you can figure out crazy solos of your own.**"
41399,"I'm a guitarist and drummer, but man do I wish I sat down and really learned how to play the piano. That was my first instrument when I was 6 but I never stuck to it, and only played by ear with no theory or more technical hand independence. Recently i've been trying, and i'll keep trying, but this is tough."
41400,"Everything, including music theory,  comes back to piano.  Always piano first.  Learn piano.   Source:  I'm a hs band director."
41401,"Extended answer:

Music notation is basically set up for piano. The notes are all in a row, every octave played the same as the last, most people even refer to the staves as left hand and right hand, because that's how you would generally approach it with a piano. A piano isn't just some instrument, like a saxophone, or a ukulele, it's a logical tool set up to play music, so it fits naturally with notation. It's like the predecessor to MIDI and recorded music, it was the best way to get all of those notes in with a single person. 

You also wont need to build calluses for piano, or spend 15 years getting your picking hand accurate and fast, no painful muting technique practice, you get to sit down on stage, you generally have a wider range of pitches, you have a fuckload more options when it comes to close harmony and wide intervals, general harmony and polyphony, you can even bend pitches on many keyboards, as well as accessing a wide range of timbres, you will likely learn notation immediately(rather than learning guitar tab and then trying to learn notation), and because notation is set up so logically it will help you learn theory faster. 

There are few things it can't do in relation to other instruments, but when it can, or can e manipulated to do so easily then other instruments are basically pointless. 

If instruments were used for cooking rather than music you could use matches, or rub sticks together, or hold it closer to the sun, but the piano is like an oven, it is scientifically designed to be the best device for its purpose so far."
41402,"> There are few things it can't do in relation to other instruments, but when it can, or can e manipulated to do so easily then other instruments are basically pointless.

Lol what. This is parody, right? Piano is fine but it can't replace having a string or air column to push on directly."
41403,"I don't know why you are downvoting me or even arguing, I am saying exactly what you are. Piano can't do those things."
41404,"You have to admit, you picked a strange way to say whatever you're saying."
41405,"I think you picked a strange way to interpret it. I explicitly said there are few things a piano can do in relation to other instruments, just like you are saying, then I said if it could do these things other instruments would be pointless, which it can't, so they aren't."
41406,"I've been in your position, but I maintain that your wording is confusing."
41407,What position am I in?
41408,Being misunderstood on the Internet
41409,You literally just made my point for me
41410,How long will it take to be good at playing piano?
41411,That's up to you
41412,What does that mean?
41413,"It depends on how you approach learning it, how much time you can put into it and finally what your goals are.   
  
Good is pretty subjective so there's no easy way to answer your question without more context."
41414,Learning anything should be measured in work hours. One year of 40 hrs a week is about the same amount of time as ~~5~~ 10 years at a half hour every day.
41415,I really disagree. You can practice 10 hours a day and get no progress. Knowing how to keep your practice time productive is a skill. Time does not equal skill.
41416,"My point is that asking ""How long does it take to be good"" is not a useful question because you need to consider time practicing. Not just time in general."
41417,"Yeah, but you should also take into consideration how long it takes for practice to become ineffective. 40 hours of practicing a week for a year is definitely going to wear you out."
41418,Half an hour a day is 3.5 hours a week and 40 hours a week is more than 11 times more than than that.
41419,"3.5 hours a week over 5 years. Roughly equivalent to 17.5 hours a week for a year.

My math was a bit off, but it's more like 2 times, not 11."
41420,"Personally, I've played it for 5 years now. I was self-tought for the first two years before I got into a music school. I've become pretty decent...
If you do it because you like it, every minute of practise will have impact. If you don't like it, you'll barely have any progress at all!
I suggest, start learning the instrument you'd most like to play, and if it isn't piano, you should learn some piano after playing your chosen instrument for a while. I promise, if you know how to play one instrument, it'll be much easier to learn a second one!
Most music schools I know of will require you to at least have piano lessons, singing lessons and one instrument of your choise, because piano is important for understanding a lot of theory, singing let's you express yourself to other musicians using voice, and a lot of people want to play other instruments as well (like guitar or drums) :)

I'm on my phone rn, so sorry if there's a lot of typos"
41421,Did you have to audition with the piano to get into the music school?
41422,"Well, the music school I'm attending (well, I'm graduating this year), would be similar to upper secondary or High School (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Norway).
Since the school gives you both the standard education as well as musical education, students is chosen by grades. However, you can have an audition to get some extra points added to your grades if you're really good...
As far as I know, it depends on the school. If there is usually a lot of applicant, or the standard is really high, they will have an audition.

I chose to go to the audition, but at the time, my main instrument was drums, so my audition was with drums.

If I where you, I'd check with several local (or far away if you want) schools to find out if they have auditions. Usually, auditions would be done by now though, so if you want to apply for next year, you're probably out of luck :P

Next year I'll be attending music technology at University College (according to Wikipedia above), where we also have instrument classes. That school didn't have any auditions at all, only grades."
41423,"What do you mean by ""good at""? Do you want to play classical music from sheet music, or learn basic chords so you can jam with other musicians for fun? The second one will take less time."
41424,"Yea, but it's still a lifetime improvement project.  That's what's great about it."
41425,Classical
41426,Find a classical teacher and take lessons. Learning by yourself would take longer.
41427,Yeah. I'm not going to teach myself.
41428,"There is no ""you ought to be able to play this well by 3 years"" formula because everyone is different. If you take lessons and apply yourself, you'll probably have bass/melody interdependence by the end of your first year, but it's not that simple."
41429,"One of my classmates was a voice major who–in his first keyboard class–had to be shown where middle C was.

By the end of the first semester, he was playing the first Chopin Nocturne amazingly well. Everyone was floored by his progress. 

So I think he means you get what you put in."
41430,"This man started learning piano in his 20s (which many would consider ""too late"" compared to those 5 year-old piano prodigies) and he released this Jazz album only 6 years after he began learning. He obviously busted his ass off, but you can do it in a relatively short amount of time. How do I know all this? I read the Youtube comments.

41431,"As an adult, you can learn, however kids are fearless, so as an adult learner, you have to have patience with your playing. Adults have the plus of being more motivated than a kid. However adults have less time to practice.

Source: learned piano from the age of 5, then learned to play fiddle in my 30s."
41432,"What's ""good"" to you? A lot of pianists never feel they are ever good enough by their own standards, which can be a good thing because it is a driving force to getting better and better. 

What's your short term goal?"
41491,"I just want playing an instrument as a skill, you know. Maybe play when I'm alone. Play for someone. Nothing too professional like for a band or anything."
41434,"Well basically, you never stop learning. There is always some hard piece that is too difficult for you. But with dedicated practice you can be playing some beautiful pieces after 2-3 years. Maybe longer maybe shorter. It really depends on how much effort you put into it, your teacher etc. Most important thing imo is just playing as regularly as possible, atleast when you are starting out. It definitely sounds like you want to play piano, it's a beautiful instrument, I'd say go for it."
41436,"One of my favorite sayings is that it takes 10 years to be bad at the violin. That's, of course, due to the relative difficulty of playing in tune.

As others have said, your aptitude combined with effort will determine how objectively good you are. Subjectively, you have to decide what you consider good."
41437,"If you want to be a good all around musician, play piano. If you want to be a good all around musician and get chicks, play guitar. If you want to always play with other musicians, play bass. If you are insane, play the drums."
41438,This. And learn to sing.
41439,This is so true
41440,"I really think guitar and piano both have it's ups and downs.
Guitar is easier To transpose, but piano have more and easier acessible voicings.
Piano have a wider range and guitar is more portable.
Guitar have more ""sibilings"" (bass, electric/acoustic, uke, mandolin, banjo, etc.) that you can re-use and exchange technique. Piano have keyboards/synths that open a wide variety of possibilities soundwise.
I think both are viable as far as theory goes but you have to analize your needs/possibilities.

I'm a guitar player myself, but I really admire  piano as the great instrument it is and I'm trying to get around finding my way in these keyboards"
41441,">Guitar is easier To transpose

I have played piano since I was a kid; I know scales in every key, so transposing is a breeze. Guitar for me - not so much. Capo is how I transpose on a guitar!"
41442,"At least at a entry level transposing chords (even more if you think of simples chords) think chords on tha shapes of E, A or D, power chords, you can just move you hands up and down without changing anything. Piano every chords have a slightly diferent ""shape"", really easy To do anything in C major but you have to do some more thinking To get the notes On piano even though i find single notes can be easier To find on the keybed. As a experienced player is a diferent story and when you are used To it it probably gets as easy or easier with the added bonus of more acessible voicings. 
But i think is A thing that is up for debate."
41443,"Piper's right, but just in case you need a second opinion to convince you of that....piano. It's the single most useful tool for learning music you can have. Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it. In addition to being the most helpful, it's also the most versatile. There's a reason so much keyboard music has been written throughout history."
41444,"Uhmm...
> Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it.

Single note, legato crescendo/decrescendo. XD"
41445,"It decrescendos, just slowly lol"
41446,You can do all that on piano if you know how.
41447,"You can imply legato and crescendo, but it cannot be fully realized in the same way as a violin/flute. Similarly a violin can imply a certain level of polyphony, but it cannot achieve it in the same way as a piano."
41448,"This is true.

Organs can play nicer crescendo and synthesizers nicer legato, so the perfect instrument must be the polyphonic synthesizer."
41449,my man!
41450,This is why my username is what it is haha
41451,Aka a piano with pitch and volume wheels
41452,"I expected someone to come around saying ""but you learn the piano first,"" which is why it always comes back to the piano."
41453,Like I didn't need another reason to buy a poly6..
41454,It also specializes in portamento
41455,You can certainly do that with a synth. I also have piano samples that can be manipulated to crescendo.
41457,"And if not, buy a melodica"
41458,"Yeah, i need to get one"
41459,Well that's just not true. I love piano but I made a special point of learning smaller instruments because I love to play music while camping and backpacking. Piano can't do that.
41460,? i have a small casio keyboard that literally fits in my backpack. lol
41461,"Well, for starters we prefer to be a little more professional than playing some casio that fits in a backpack at real gigs, and furthermore I imagine that's only 2-3 octaves which severely limits your playing ability compared to an 88 key. I also assume your keys aren't weighted.

Also, it still doesn't matter if we don't have power, which is roughly 50% of our gigs. Your backpack keyboard speakers aren't keeping up with several guitars and voices. 

Edit -- woops, didn't realize which comment you replied to. If you've ever backpacked before you realize how much space *any* keyboard takes up. It would be horribly inconvenient to backpack with a casio keyboard.  

Plus then you have to worry about batteries and keeping the thing from getting wet or too dirty. Plus I just dislike playing non-weighted keys."
41463,"Well that's closer but still not true. I play in an acoustic folk band and we play in coffeehouses, bars, and outdoor events all the time. It would be an enormous headache to try and bring a keyboard with us everywhere and often just impossible because power sometimes isn't available. And a real piano is straight up out of the question for 9 out of 10 gigs we play.

Piano is absolutely the most versatile, theoretically important instrument I can think of, but it's also among the most impractical to travel with or expect to be able to play at any gig unless you're a big time performer."
41464,"> Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it.

And it does exactly none of that as good as instruments dedicated to those specific things.

Piano is good for learning but poor for performing music."
41465,"Adding another vote for the piano

The fact everything is so well laid out made it really simple for me to wrap my head around. Not just with the keys, but when looking at the grand staff, it all translates well. 

Plus it's just a beautiful instrument with a lot of amazing history. 

But if you just want to jam with friends, I know a lot of people who just pick up the guitar for this. Much easier to carry around and play pop songs with."
41466,"You should learn the instrument that calls to you.  Seriously.  You have to spend hours and hours and hours and hours listening to it.  Living with it.  Practicing it.  Thinking about it.  Dreaming about it.  If, for you, the instrument that calls to you is the nose flute, than that is what you should learn to play and master.  Music comes from the heart.  To play really well you and your instrument have to be connected on some ineffable level.  -- If you want to master music _theory_, (ie, achieve a superior academic and intellectual understanding of musicial communication) then piano.  If you want to master _music_, then you need to match your soul to the instrument."
41467,"Piano, I choose you!"
41468,"In a music theory subreddit, piano.

But if I want to be much more mobile than technically proficient, guitar."
41469,Piano hands down.
41470,Wrists up
41471,"What music do you want to play?

is probably a good question to ask yourself at this point, to help guide your decision."
41472,Something like Ghibli music.
41473,Piano then
41474,"I would say, voice. The Indian classical tradition revolves around either emulating the natural sound of the voice or accompanying/supporting it.

Given today's music technology—with access to a microphone, audio I/O device and computer—you have at your disposal a melodic instrument, percussive instrument, and harmonic instrument (with the addition of looping, etc.).

I only say this because people often understate the importance of the voice as an instrument, otherwise I'd say piano."
41475,"As a classical singer, I'm of the opinion all instrumentalists should learn to sing, and all singers should learn to play an instrument. they really help each other. So... Singing and piano?"
