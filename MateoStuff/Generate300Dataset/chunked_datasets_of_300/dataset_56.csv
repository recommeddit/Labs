17920,Really? Good to know
17921,"Hahaha yeah other than that she’s pretty chill, I love watching her YouTube"
17922,"Kimmie has always been my fave, I can’t help it"
17924,Same! I think she just does her though
17925,Kourtney. Especially in the past seasons. She may be a bitch now and all that but I kind of understand her wanting to do her own thing and focus more on her kids.
17926,"Kourtney can be a bitch now but I think she’s just had to resort to that, she’s been through some hard times. She gave so much to the show in the earlier seasons and does deserve a break"
17927,Kris
17928,Yeah lol Kris who is basically behind it all and the backbone
17929,Kourt and Kim for dif reasons
17930,Kim
17931,I like Kourtney right now. Khloé used to be my favourite for years.
17932,"I go through phases too. Khloe reminded me a lot of my sister and I love her humor, so she used to be my favorite. I still like her, but I think nowadays, I'm starting to like Kim the most. I also bounced between liking Kendall too, but I think what annoyed me was seeing how mean and critical she is to Kylie.

But back to Kim: I think all her hard work is paying off, and it shows. I love her strong work ethic and how professional she is. She's the type of woman who knows what she wants, and works towards making that happen. Obviously she's fortunate to have the resources, but still. She really matured throughout the years, and I think there's a reason why Khloe is starting to gravitate more towards that."
17933,"Yeah Kendall and Kylie seem to have a bit of a feud sometimes but maybe that’s just being close in age and growing less close as they got older, they’re very different to each other I guess. I love how motivated and positive Kim is, she really seems to try and make the most of her life and others. And her work ethic is off the charts, wish I had that! I think Khloe admires this about her and it motivates her to be the same way which is why they are closer now"
17934,Rob

17947,"I think Khloe is pretty awesome and will always put her first. She has always been my fave. I stand by her. She is honest, funny and just seems like someone you would want as a friend."

Something about kourtney lately that doesn't sit right with me"
17984,What about Kourt doesn’t sit right with you that she wants to put her kids and real life before the tv show?
17985,"Nah I get that part. Just the way she handles it I guess, I find it sneaky or something. Like if she truly wants to leave then leave. But she still wants to get paid and get all the perks but not put any effort. She's not a victim, but she likes to play one."
17986,I assume because her family pressures her to stay. The show is already doing poorly.
17987,That’s her whole personality IMO. That’s why poosh happened.
17988,"the victim complex? Bc if that's what you mean, I 100% agree.

Anyways, everyone knows poosh is a joke and just a safe way to make herself feel like she's doing something. Even she knows it's a joke.  she doesn't have the balls to leave the show, only complain about it. That's all she does, complain. 

She's too insecure to put 100% into anything. I actually respect kim a lot for being able to always put 1000% into any idea she has regardless of what anyone thinks. Kourtney is the opposite, terrified of failure so she half asses everything, including leaving this show, while still wanting a pitty party/money,perks. I dunno, she seems like the most selfish out of all of them."

Kim and khloe honestly do not even make my list lol."
18005,Kourtney and Kendall
18006,Kourtney's style is consistently good.
18007,And the most accessible. Like I look at it and see an outfit that could be recreated.
18008,"Honestly, neither. I like bits from every sisters, but none of them as a whole."
18009,"after reading this, I actually agree with you!"
18010,Kourt 111110000000%
18011,Kourtney's style is the best.
18012,I loved kylies emo lite  era and her blue hair was iconic at the time
18013,honourable mention! I like that phase too - she did it very well
18017,Kourtney
18016,Kourt
18018,Kim. She’s the OG trendsetter.
18022,I think poor Kylie was so blindsided & hurt. I think if she wasn't she would have spoken out about it already.
18023,"And I was just thinking about this: it’s not *just*  that Jordyn messed with her sisters boyfriend. If Jordyn was my friend, after that whole situation I honestly wouldn’t trust her around my man🤷🏻‍♀️ and it’s not that I don’t trust my man, but it’s still disrespectful to attempt to hook up with him. Travis may be trustworthy, but I would still be upset if I were Kylie if Jordyn made attempts. She ain’t trustworthy after all that."
18024,"Weren’t Tristan and Khloe broken up at the time? I wonder why it’s okay for Kendall and Kylie’s friend Sofia to be dating Scott, but Jordyn is being treated like a traitor (unless, of course, they weren’t broken up)."
18025,I don’t think they were broken up but there’s a lot of people definitely theorizing that they were broken up and that this whole mess was an excuse to publicly break up🧐
18026,"Kim-She is aware of herself, she understands her influence she has on people and uses it to her advantage. She’s a very smart business women. She has been able to keep herself relevant over the past decade. That’s a hard thing to accomplish. She is very dramatic and bratty. While sometimes she can be her siblings biggest supporter and cheerleader she can also be very critical and hurtful. 

Kourtney- She seems like a fun mom. She is all about her kids when it comes to fun and memories  and experiences. I also love her style. She is very judge mental and super outspoken to the point that I’d almost say she says things that in my opinion would be unforgivable. I also hate that if she doesn’t agree with someone she automatically puts them down and calls them annoying. 


Khloe- She loves life and Loves her family even more. I feel like family is her #1 priority. She always try’s to see the positive side of things in life and she is a hopeless romantic (while this can also be a negative character trait of hers). I fee like she would be the only one to be okay if she “lost it all” I think she is the most in touch with reality with “common folk” lol ( I’m sure you can tell she’s my favorite). She is an enabler to Rob. She is very easy to forgive people. She will do anything for the man she’s with even it comes to turning her back on her moral code. I think she has a lot of issues when it comes to the way she handles  her relationships with men. 

Kendall- Gorgeous and I appreciate how she keeps her private life pretty private compared to all the other sisters. She is so unaware of everything. She has been so privileged in her life that she lacks any awareness of what’s going on in the real world. I don’t think she really understands how some of her actions and decisions could offended people. I feel like out of all the apologies the Kardashian/ Jenner’s make hers are always the least sincere. 

Kylie- obviously gorgeous and seems super into her little family. She seems very confident and happy I’m her relationship and private life. She is so aware that she can get younger people to buy literally anything she shills, She uses that to her advantage. I also despise how she always is on her soap box about not wanting to be famous. I feel like out of all her sisters besides Kim she LOVES being famous and relevant the most. 


One thing I hate about the 3 older sisters and Kris that they have in common is I believe they are a big part of the reason Rob is the way he is. While I do believe obviously Robs actions both mentally and physically are his fault and he did a lot of this to himself and I believe he needs to seek mental health treatment I don’t think the sisters helped his well being in the slightest. From Khloe/ kris enabling him for so long. To Kim/Kourtney  constantly calling him a loser/ annoying and telling him he will never amount to anything for so long. To always emasculating him making him feel less than. I’m not shocked he’s gone down hill over the years."
18027,"You're so right about Kendall, like the whole Pepsi thing and the ""I don't walk like 30 shows a day, that's not the type of model I am"" - all her apologies just come across as really insincere because it's obvious that she's not very self-aware and that she's not really taking the steps to become more self-aware."
18028,Yeah it’s like she’s only apologizing because she has to she doesn’t feel one ounce of remorse. If anything she feels misunderstood and doesn’t understand why people are attacking her. If you notice all her fake ass apologizes she is always sorry and there is a But right after. She always has a lame excuse. The entitlement from her and Kourtney sickens me the most. They are just so unaware.
18029,I agree with you about Kylie. Always going on and on about wanting to be normal. At least Kim admits she loves fame and attention. Kylie loves it but acts like she doesn’t to seem relatable I guess? Idk. She wants the money and fame and attention but only when it benefits her. Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
18030,"Khloe’s flaw is that she ever trusted Tristan. I also personally think that the Jenner’s fall short when it comes to acknowledging their privilege. I think that rob sr. made sure that his kids understood how others lived and it’s helped the older sisters be a little more grounded. Of course, it may be an age thing"
18031,"Kim: Very hard-working and ambitious. But superficial and cold at times to her own family.

Khloe: I think she is the funniest and kindest. She is also very hardworking. But she's insecure and allows herself to get taken advantage of.

Kendall: She's pretty but she seems the most out of touch with reality.

Kylie: Very entrepreneurial, influential, and has a unique style. However, I think she hides her personality on KUWTK for some reason and comes across very blah.

Kourtney: I'm sure she's an amazing mom. But she's very self-centered, often rude, and she lacks drive and ambition."
18032,"I definitely agree with all yours points! 

Kim - I really respect the career/empire she has built over the years and she’s definitely a smart woman. That time where she slut-shamed Bella Thorne (I think that’s who Scott flew out to Dubai on the family vacation?) put a really bad taste in my mouth, even if it was just for the show. 

Kourtney - Her style, her passion for being a mother and living a clean and healthy lifestyle is really inspiring to me. She can be hypocritical when it comes to coparenting with Scott and seems like she lacks self awareness when it comes to her own faults and mistakes. 

Khloe - She’s hilarious, probably the most genuine out of everyone and you can tell she truly puts her family first, which I admire. I think she definitely has some anger issues and she’s always quick to yell/swear/snap at someone for saying something she doesn’t agree with, plus the whole Tristan/Jordyn situation where she was definitely taking advantage of being the victim and making people feel sorry for her. 

Kendall - Something about Kendall I really love and I know most people won’t agree but I find her to be one of the most interesting sisters? Her style has been kinda whack recently but she’s absolutely gorgeous. I really hate that she got work done on her face and lied about it but I guess they’ve all done it at this point. 

Kylie - I lowkey am obsessed with Kylie to the point where my entire explore page on instagram is pretty much her. I LOVE that she seems genuinely happy with her little family that I remember her saying in a Teen Vogue interview that she wanted to accomplish by 2025, and that she seems to be keeping her life a lot more private nowadays which I think is so much better for her mental health. I only really dislike how over the years she’s lost so much of her personality due to the fear of being judged and hated on, like girl BE YOURSELF WE LOVE YOU!!!"
18033,"Okay Kim screaming at that girl in Dubai was SO unnecessary. Why wasn’t she yelling at Scott? I don’t think anybody should slut shame but Kim Kardashian, a literal sex symbol, should especially not slut shame anyone"
18034,"Hi, heyhalfpint!

I am dropping by to offer you a robot hug! I hope the rest of your day is fantastic!

-HappyFriendlyBot"
18035,Do we know for sure it was Bella Thorne?
18036,"Kim:


she is my favorite. I like how calm she can be, how disciplined she is, her support for her husband, and her ambitions, especially when it comes to helping people


I think that her constant striving to look flawless and all the selfies seem a little insecure at times. She doesn't need all that in my opinion.


Khloe:


Her honesty, her discipline, her positivity, her passion


Honestly, I think she might be trying a little too hard to look pretty which makes her look a little unnatural at times. She is pretty without all that.


Kourtney:


Her passion for a healthy life, how she always wants to spend time with her kids, how calm she appears, her sense of humor


I feel that she often builds walls around her emotionally and doesn't try to understand other people's perspectices


Kendall:


her attitude to be down for whatever


I don't really pay enough attention to her to know what I would dislike about her


Kylie:


How much she loves being a mom and how she cherished her pregnancy that she just wanted it to be special privately instead of seeking attention


This is not so much her doing but Forbes saying she is a self made billionaire. Good for her that she is successful but 1) she already had the attention and fanbase and 2) her family's money and 3) it's lipstick. It's not like she had a super unique idea. Again, great that she is successful and passionate about it but there are people out there that came from.nothing that get little or no recognition"
18037,"Kim: i think she’s genuinely funny, in a self-aware way. the video of her telling north why she’s famous is proof that kim is hilarious. / kim promotes unhealthy body image, like posting videos of khloe calling her anorexic. she needs to stop! also, she enables kanye’s problematic behavior and egotism.

Kris: kris is totally unselfaware and hilarious. she’s sort of pathetic and powerful in equal measures. i also think she cares a lot about her family and tried to support caitlin. / kris didn’t instill a proper sense of reality and privilege in kendall and kylie. she kind of stopped parenting them when they were like 15. she’s too concerned with being a cool mom, and doesn’t provide moral guidance for her kids

Kourtney: she has a really acerbic wit and dry humour. she is very honest and perceptive. / kourtney is massively entitled and thinks that just because she puts her kids first, everyone else has to. she uses her kids as an excuse for her selfishness.

Khloe: her behavior is the most entertaining and she definitely keeps it real with her sisters. her comments are usually the most entertaining because she’ll read her sisters for filth. / She is a bit pathetic when it comes to men and seems to crave their validation above all else, so she forgives their bad behavior and acts like it a woman’s duty to do so. 

Kendall: she’s the most private which is guess is resepctable? honestly i can’t think of one funny kendall story from the whole show. however, i think it was admirable how she fought for her dad to be accepted by the family. / she seems to think her family background means she wasn’t taken seriously as a model, rather than crediting her family’s fame as the main reason she ever made it big. 

Kylie: she’s the most driven, it seems like she really know what she wants and tries to get it. in this way she might be contrasted with kendall, who is pretty lazy. kylie could literally do anything. / she is pretty guilty of promoting a culture which profits from trends and styles appropriated from the black community"
18038,"Kim- I really respect her hustle and her ability to take things in stride and just handle shit that gets thrown at her. Seems like the most level-headed of the bunch. She's a very sweet person. Seems like she has recently discovered an actual sense of humor which has been refreshing// Dislike how she tends to invalidate others' feelings and acts like her opinions are facts. Definitely has bratty tendencies. Not a fan of her style these days. 

Kourtney- IMO has the best style of the sisters. I like that she doesn't get taken over by fashion fads as much as the rest of them. She's good for a one-liner, has a very dry sense of humor (perhaps being with Scott for 10 years rubbed off?). // Seems like she is severely delusional. Has very little drive/work ethic. Way too flakey. Takes all of her Kardashian privileges for granted, yet refuses to do her share of contribution to the brand.

Khloe- Definitely the most grounded/in touch with reality. Seems like she genuinely appreciates what they all have and I suspect has always prepared herself for it to go away. I respect her loyalty and how hard she loves. Seems to have the most developed personality, probably because she didn't get by her whole life by just being pretty// Obviously gets way too wrapped up in her romantic relationships. She hasn't really been single since Lamar and I think it would do her good. She's very reactionary. Comes off as slightly unintelligent to me sometimes.

Kendall- I like how she kind of does her own thing from the rest of her sisters. She has a cool sense of style. She seems to be the only one to maintain a close relationship with Caitlyn, which I respect despite my feelings about a lot of Caitlyn's actions. // Kendall has literally zero concept of reality and makes no attempt to gain any kind of perspective. Maybe the most boring? I honestly don't have much of an opinion on her, positive or negative.

Kylie- Obviously has crazy hustle/business savvy as she is the highest earner of the fam. Seems like a very attentive mom and loyal partner. She definitely has a relatable quirky/goofy side that doesn't get shown on camera very often. // Seems very entitled. It irks me that she complains so much about being famous. Comes across very bland on the show most of the time. I really dislike her Instagram persona.

A couple of likes/dislikes on the family as a whole- They are all ride or die loyal for each other no matter what, and have kept family their #1 priority. Most other celebrities/people in the business seem to have nice things to say about them, which I think is pretty telling for an industry of people who could have easily rejected them. // They all have obviously had major work done, yet deny it which is super toxic. Zero chance those butts are all natural lol. I don't have a problem with plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures, but the fact that they have been lying for years about having them done is irresponsible. They also treat pets like they are disposable (except for a few) which really bothers me."
18039,"Kim- I love her dedication to being successful. She is very, very smart and is very business oriented. Also, I think Kim is an old soul at heart. She is definitely my favorite. / I think sometimes she can be too cold and mean spirited towards her family. In the earlier seasons she was very vain too. 

Kourtney- Love her sense of humor and idgaf attitude. I think she’s hysterical, personally. I also think she is the most beautiful. / She is just not there emotionally and can’t express herself or help anyone with hard times. She can also be mean.

Khloe- I think she has a good heart and has good intentions. She’s also very dedicated to working hard and she definitely did the most at Dash. / She can be annoying sometimes. I really don’t like her sense of humor and constantly belittling those around her. She can be insensitive. 

Kendall- My second favorite. The most vibey in the family and very chill. She is the only one I could see myself getting really close with as a friend. / She can be bratty and standoffish. 

Kylie- Very smart business wise like Kim. She seems nice and is a good mother. / I don’t love Kylie like everybody seems to. She just seems very fake to me, everything about her seems manufactured by a test group."
18040,"I agree re: Kylie. My boyfriend (i got him into watching it with me even though he used to roast me for watching/talking about KUWTK) & I talk about how fake Kylie is/seems to be, not even her fillers, etc just her personality. In the interviews on the show she speaks so slowly it seems like she’s being very careful with everything she says & you never see her real true personality. That being said, she really is a brilliant (while not necessarily self-made) businesswoman & a really good mom to Stormi."
18041,"Kim: Watching the show u can see she’s the most humble even though she comes off different in social media and I like that she tries to learn to do North’s hair and be more aware of race issues//her constant appropriation of black culture and using North as an excuse. That video her and Malika made admist the Jordyn drama turned me off of her, very childish for someone her age

Kourt: I love her sense of humor and style, she stays in her lane as far as race issues and doesn’t try to appropriate black culture like her sisters//she seems lazy and out of touch with the real world. Loves the lifestyle but doesn’t wanna put in work and acts the most entitled even though she does the least and is the least popular

Khloe: Used to love her, she always seemed the most down to earth.// that comment she made about Jordyn ruining her family pissed me off. Tries too hard with her style and copying black women

Kylie: I like that she’s been lowkey lately, seems like she’d be fun to chill with and a good friend//I don’t like that she copies and steals ideas fashion wise. Also don’t like how she always goes on and on about wanting to be normal when she knows she doesn’t, she tried too hard to seem relatable. That whole Forbes self made issue is a mess. I don’t like that she acts like she started kylie Cosmetics in a garage with a $20K loan or something. Shows she’s out of touch with reality, but it’s expected when you’re born into money. Just own and accept your privilege 

Kendall: pretty, nice style, minds her business. //Sane thing, she doesn’t realize how blessed she is for her modeling career to take off so quickly. Acts like she started from the bottom"
18042,"I don't think Kylie is out of touch with reality. She admits she is not self-made and had a lot of help from others. The ""self-made"" thing was started entirely by Forbes."
18043,"Kim - she knows her influence/power. She navigates all the stresses of stardom so well. She’s incredibly vain and judge mental tho.

Kourtney - I think she’s hilarious. Great mom. Also judge mental.

Khloe - I would love to be her friend the most. She tries to have fun and loves her family. She is very insecure tho.

Kendall - idk much about her

Kylie - I have an irrational dislike for her"
18044,"The flaw that they *all* have is not being honest or up front about the work they've had done on their bodies. With the exception of Kendall, they've all had boob jobs. Kim, Khloe, and Kylie have all had Brazilian butt lifts, fat transfers or something to that effect. They've all had *lots* of help, and it's not just having a personal trainer. I don't mind that they've had the work done, I just wish they'd be more upfront about it."
18045,y would u put kim and kris on the same poll lol?? couldve left out rob
18046,i don't want to leave out rob :( He deserves to be in there.
18047,yeah seeing that zero is pretty satisfying
18048,I just thought to include him into the poll because he's part of the family I don't wanna exclude anyone
18049,It’s fine to exclude him. He posted revenge porn to Twitter of the mother of his child. He’s trash.
18050,"I didn't know that, is there stuff I can read on rob? I just didn't want to seem like a bad person for excluding him."
18051,Google Rob Kardashian + revenge porn & tons of articles should come up about it 💗
18052,Don’t worry the rob fans just aren’t online yet! I hate that I usually forget him in post so I’m happy you did
18053,Could have put him with Kendal or something they both need the votes lol
18054,"Kim and kris (well les be honest, the entire fam is controversial) but I loveee kim and kris so much because they’re the ultimate shot callers meaning they both know that fame, money & power is pretty much all a game & they know how to play annd win that game. Of course they’ve always been pretty privileged and well off but like how we say some people can turn a “nickel into a dollar,” kim and kris know how to turn a million turn into a hundred million haha"
18055,i agree with this haha yas
18056,"Yes also to add to my comment, kim and kris have taught me a lot and have even helped me negotiate office politics at work. Like how kim keeps her cool and doesnt fight back (for example like when that interviewer was hella passive aggressive with her in a post someone else shared earlier today). Kris gives everyoneee in her staff niceee presents. The karjenners always look neat from head to toe like with clean hair and a styled outfit even when in sweats. 

Ya a lot of what they do is superficial, but remaining professional when you’re still climbing the fame/corporate ladder, treating everyone below you (as in your subordinates) kindly, and looking polished are important things that i wish my own mother had taught me.

Also i know kris sometimes gets tough with her employees like even steph shep has said that, but that’s also taught me to have a thicker skin when others are tough and to be more self aware so that i dont come off mean."

18060,"Kourtney won me over in early years and in especially Miami, and I love the boundaries she sets now. She is also very interesting to look at-some might say the most."
18061,Ugh I couldn’t vote cause it’s Kim and kourtney lol I’d do Kim but I hate Kris lol
18062,Kim is my favorite but Kris is my least favorite. I'm conflicted 😕
18063,Why isn't none ever a choice? Just curious.
18064,Bc it just takes up space when theres only 6 options anyway
18065,Never knew that. Thanks for filling me in.
18066,i knew this sub was full of kourtney stans🙄
18067,"Kim or Khloe actually

I dont like Kourtney at all

Kanedall and Kylie are just there 😂"
18068,true
18069,I'm camping here for the tea
18070,"Same girl, I’m intrigued"
18071,"Deuxmoi on instagram has been posting a few stories submitted about the Kardashians. Apparently Kim is very personable and sweet to her fans. Also very professional on set. 

If I'm remembering correctly, I think there was a blind about Kylie Jenner or Khloe and her crew absolutely trashing a hotel room and leaving it reeking of weed and coke residue everywhere which isn't very surprising."
18072,"I genuinely think the Jenner siblings would be MEGA bratty. They were really young when the show started and by the time they were old enough to feel some type of way, they were already rolling in cash"
18073,"It wasn’t a blind, but around 2013 Kylie and her friends were partying in a hotel room, and Kylie was denied bottle service because she was 16. She got really mad at the staff and left"
18074,Lmao and she expected what exactly to happen when she asked for alcohol at 16? Entitled as hell lmao.
18075,Lmao wasn‘t there a story of Tyga and Kylie wanting to enter a club together but they denied Kylie because she wasn‘t even 18 yet?
18076,"I have never met Kim personally, but I saw her at a meet and greet in Vegas years ago and she was really smiley and talkative with her fans."
18077,The later sounds like Kylie
18078,"Kim is always spoken about highly, everybody that’s met her always say that she’s very sweet. I’m not sure about the rest. They probably avoid talking to people at all costs."
18079,"I've heard that about Kim too, that she's really lovely to speak to. I think Kylie gives legit brat vibes"
18080,Lol I genuinely don’t think she would even know how to have a engaging conversation with a fan even if she tried
18081,"I met Kim and Khloe at an appearance. Both as sweet as you’d imagine at an event like that. My impression is that they both really experienced at interacting with people in that context but I’m sure personally they are much less charming, and more normal! Hahaha

I get the impression Kylie has missed out on that fan experience. For example, Kim had to learn to charm her fans as part of making herself famous, where Kylie’s fans were handed to her so she never had to learn to interact with them!"
18083,I once ubered Kim’s body guard to Kim’s HOUSE and yeah he was so handsome and nice. Gave me a big tip and left me a compliment. I wish I could remember his name :(
18084,"Whyd she do that lol

I always felt really bad for her kids, to be growing in front of the lens

I always suspected Kendall and Kylie didn't care about school"
18085,I am DYING at the Todd Kraines thing
18086,">""he also said that when kim thought no one was looking, she went through jojo siwa’s kitchen counters lmao ((jojo’s mom saw this through their house cameras)""

But... Why?"
18087,"maybe she was curious about that normal people eat? 
i also asked why she did that & he said that jojo siwa’s mom was just like “omg!!! kim kardashian is going through my kitchen” instead of being weirded out lol. when i watched the kuwtk episode, kim goes into jojo’s merch room & facetimed kanye to show him & when she hears someone coming, she runs away lol"
18088,">""maybe she was curious about that normal people eat?""

She could come to my kitchen for that!!"
18089,Omg lolol i love that
18090,I know someone that’s met Kim through their work. He said she was very sweet but he was honestly surprised she could walk and chew gum at the same time.
18091,People can’t talk and chew gum?
18092,It’s an expression that means someone’s a bit dumb
18093,"Oh lol, I guess I’m a bit dumb"
18094,"You just haven’t heard it before, you’re fine!"
18095,"I had a friend in a college class who told me a story that he was vacationing with rich friends, who were renting a house, and the Kardashians were renting the adjacent house. He could have been making it up, I guess. He said Kourtney and Kim were super sweet, super tiny and I think he said Kim was prettier in person, all things I’ve heard said before."
18096,"I have a few stories. I have worked in the special events industry and at most if not all of their houses. 4 years ago I worked the infamous party that happens around a certain holiday
 I worked at on of the houses 2 days before the holidays, took the holiday off and then worked the day after the holiday. The day after the holiday I was in the garage and Kim came in, she asked me how I was doing and how my holiday was, if I had spent it with my family or not. I told her i spent it alone because my roommates were out of town and my family was in another state. Upon hearing that, she said ""I wish i had known, we would have had you over here"".

That was an incredibly kind thing to say, as difficult as it would have been to have a conversation with her the days before and actually have that be the subject, iys still kind that she would have opened her doors to me. 

I have also witnessed her be an extremely kind, compassionate and fierce momma!

Kim is amazing. I have stories of the other sisters. They all are kind"
18097,So my sister's bestie brother is a producer and KUWTK was one of his first shows post graduation(he is listed in the credits) and out of all of complaints he had it always came back to Khloe just being super loud and bossy and annoying.
18098,Someone I know produced cocktails with Khloe and he had a similar complaint - she wasn’t the best person to work with.
18099,I didn't get to ask him (her brother) but because he didn't have any stories about Kourt and Kim I think he was just Khloe's producer they should share notes lol
18100,What else!!!
18101,"I should have corrected myself, he left back in 2017 or 2018 and I really should ask more! He lives in the West Coast and the last time he was east side was for a family funeral but I'll ask his sister!"
18102,"Kim is SO kind. Ran into her a couple times at a restaurant and have family friends that know her and always defend her. She truly is a great person. She is also TINY IRL. Like 5 feet tall and her body doesn’t look nearly as disproportionate as it does in photos. She was insanely tan as well! Lol  but yeah, Genuinely a great woman with a huge heart. Loves her fans and understands her life is public and has no problem with that. She knows it took fans to get where she is. Kourt on the other hand... lol 

Kourtney has kids that go to my cousin’s school. As we saw in this last season, she hates the fame and can get really upset about all the attention. She yelled at one of the parents at a bday party at a pumpkin patch because she thought they were taking pics of her. Maybe they were, maybe they weren’t... point is she’s super bothered by the attention she gets and can be quite hostile about it. 

Idk if she understands that Poosh wouldnt exists without KUWTK. She needs to humble herself. There is no such thing as privacy anymore. You capitalized on being “yourself” and your lifestyle. If you want to keep that lifestyle, you have to continue to share 🤷🏼‍♀️That just is what it is"
18103,She’s clearly trying to go the GOOP route. Gwyneth isn’t really photographed by the paparazzi that much. I feel like Kourtney is trying to be taken seriously in a way where she can maintain her status without always having her success be rooted in the “my sister became famous thanks to the Ray J sex tape” story.
18104,True!! Curious to see if/ how the company grows...
18105,"I remember there was a video of kylie at an appearance and she took a fans phone did a 180 selfie and didn’t hand the phone back just dropped it on the ground

ETA: I can’t find the video on YouTube or anything about it on google. I remember it was like right when her and tyga started dating"
18106,What the hell?! Yikes that's just.. That's super gross lmao. Did she pick it up? Was it an accident?
18107,"No it was just like one of those things that looked like “I’m not gonna hand you your phone peasant here” and dropped it, like half turning around. I can’t find the video and I’m mad bc I remember it so well lol"
18108,What the hell that's just rude I'd ask for her autograph and tear it up in front of with a comeback like sorry i dont want autographs from entitled children lmao how absolutely awful!
18109,I think I know what you’re talking about. Some girl did a vlog on YouTube about some Kylie event and she came out to only take the selfie and left. Am I right?
18110,Yes that sounds about right lol
18111,Omg I think I remember this!  It was at some sort of pool side meet and greet right?
18112,"I’m really not sure, I just remember it being some kind of appearance. I think the fan that it happened to made a YouTube video about the experience and it must be deleted. :("
18113,If it was poolside I think it was at her 18th birthday party in montreal ! Timing seems right and i briefly remember this being a thing. I was there but it was a quite a few years ago and I was partying to my memory is cloudy lol
18114,This is terrible.
18115,"I’ve heard that Kim is like, the nicest in person. I’ve heard that Khloe is nice too, but a little more standoffish. I’ve never heard anything about anyone else in the family except what I’ve read on here lol 😂"
18117,Somehow I doubt it...Remember how she treat Snooki when she came to their house?
18118,Khloe was drunk and was caught off guard because Snooki randomly showed up to her anniversary party at her house without a personal invite. I would be weirded too if a stranger showed up to my house uninvited. Plus multiple people who met Khloe in real life said she was really nice to them.
18119,Really? In Kocktails with Khloé Snooki said that Kim invited her...
18120,"Right Kim invited her, but not Khloe or Lamar. It was they’re one year anniversary so Khloe probably only invited close family and friends. Snooki was none of that to her so Kim should have told Khloe in advance instead of letting her be caught off guard while drunk."
18121,"I didn't know that was Khloe's house! From the context of what Snooki said I thought it was Kris house (she talked about ""Kardashian house)."
18122,I haven't seen revenge body but i always get the impression that she's the most emotionally mature person
18123,The same girl who posts 30 instagram quotes a day is emotionally mature?
18124,Lmfao chill sis i aint getting paid to defend Khloe. It's just my opinion and hardly something that warrants your shady af response.
18125,The shade is toward khloe not you... 😂
18126,"Oh sorry, I misinterpreted the comment 🐸 sorry my bad"
18127,All g sis 💕
18128,"If she's the most emotionally mature person, god help the rest of them 😂"
18129,"I've heard in general there is a big difference in the Kardashians vs. the Jenners lol. I don't have personal stories honestly lol. Because Kim's narrative pre Kanye was very dicey in the media I feel like her media relationship was extra important. She was always professional, always on time, always sweet to her fans. And I think she tried to push Khloe and Kourtney to do the same, but i feel like Kourtney is not really about it anymore and kinda gets more hostile with people now.

There's a host of stories about Kendall being late, a brat, not professional lol. She's not well liked in the modeling world outside of the Hadids lol.  She always comes off entitled and she hardly does any runway shows anymore.

Then of course there's the story where Kylie was supposed to open for the Balmain fashion show bc of their makeup collab. She was going to do all their makeup looks and whatnot. I know she said she was sick, but i honestly think she was so painfully anxious that she just straight up bailed lol. I was kinda surprised by that and I'm also like how is Olivier like not more mad? He still sends her outfits that she posts on insta. So it's makes me wonder if she's bailed on events before.

Her and Kendall were born famous and got like 80 million insta followers just from like existing on the show, so it makes sense that they aren't as humble, professional and media ready as Kim, Khloe and Kourtney are lol. I don't have personal stories, but that's my two cents"
39049,Yikes
18132,Sounds about right. Do you work somewhere that he frequents?
18134,"Only last year.. A table full of women and cocaine, wouldn't have liked to have been in Sophia's shoes. Obviously I can't say for certain that he would've cheated on her, but it sure doesnt look good."
18135,They’re having relationship problems and broke up recently I think
18136,Can you explain the throwing money situation? Or link an article? Need that tea!!!
18137,"Okay so Kendall went out to dinner with another model friend, and they basically dined and dashed. So the waitress followed them out, asking them to pay and Kendall threw money in her direction (didn't even ask if it was enough and apparently it wasn't) and bounced. She didn't even hand it, she legit threw it in her general direction and the server had to pick up the money off the ground. Apparently, Kendall is famously a really awful tipper"
18138,I know someone in the criminal justice area who met Kim and said she was super nice and very engaged and eager to learn and focused on the cause. Also much shorter than they had imagined.
18139,I'm. Honestly most curious about Kourtney. I know the least about her personality
18140,I don't know whether to believe Kendall threw money at the waitress. She seems sensitive and down to earth on the show. I read a lot of Kendall bashing on here and I wonder if people think she's stuck up because she's introverted. I can relate to her more than the other family members.
18141,"I 100% believe the [0$ tip receipt ](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-accused-not-tipping-receipts)with her name on it, personally. The bar is very popular and there’s no reason they would make it up as a successful business lol"
18142,"I find it not that hard to believe because I've heard even other stories of Kendall being really rude to staff in a restaurant, and being really rude to basically everyone who isn't her ""squad""

I also read a twitter thread where she insulted someone's appearance when they came up to her for something so there's that."
18143,"Idk about now but when she was a teenager, there were a lot of reports about her being rude. It wasn’t a one time story"
18144,"She did deny it on Twitter. I personally think it was half true. Kendall did admit she left and forgot to pay, but said she was apologetic and paid £33 and £7 tip. I personally doubt she apologetic too. She probably frustrated and embarrassed to be called out so publicly (as it was probably a accident) and rushed the interaction. I bet the waitress found her quite rude and hostile, and exaggerated a little in her tweets."

A few years ago, my mother, little brother, and I were playing with our new Chromecast. Family bonding, ya know? We were just hanging out, streaming a random playlist of stupid videos to the living room TV. Everything is going great..And then this fucking woman comes up on. 

I’ll never forget the look on my poor mother’s face. Right below the cross on the wall, a woman was grapefruiting a fucking giant dildo. Worse, it was in surround sound. 

All hell broke loose. Suddenly, my mother is screaming, demanding I turn it off. Little brother is in shock, but begging me to keep playing it. I’m laughing so hard, I start crying and can’t figure out how to shut it off. 

Yeah, so, Chromecast time ended after that. My mom is still convinced I did it on purpose. Worth it though."
