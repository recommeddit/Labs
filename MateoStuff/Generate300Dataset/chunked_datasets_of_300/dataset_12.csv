3882,"I know what you mean. I'm only on week three here, but I keep having mini flashes where I freak out that I made a wrong decision."
3883,Agreed! But not if it's from some random one
3884,"UCLA has their ""Empowered"" program where you can receive certificates and they are a credible university. 

EDIT:Certificates, not Degrees"
3885,"No, you don't receive degrees.  Your receive ""Certificates""."
3886,"If you receive, say, a masters degree online from Duke, would it be the same as taking traditional on-campus courses? You could still just put M.A. in Underwater Basket Weaving on your resume, right?"
3887,yes. But good luck getting a masters online from Duke.
3888,"My dad's 3rd Masters is from IU's online program. Degree doesn't make any mention of that fact. Of course, it's not like it's been put to the Job Application test since he's been in the same field for 40+ years."
3889,What's IU?  What are the three masters in?  I'm just curious.  I wish I had three masters
3890,"Indiana University, mentioned upthread."
3891,"Indiana University. Masters from them was in Public Affairs in the early 2000s, others were in engineering in the late 70s from, obviously, more traditional programs. I wish I had three Masters as well, or at least that mine was in something useful."
3892,"Yep, a lot of universities in Canada are now offering programs where some or all classes can be completed online. They are fully accredited and not differentiated from the non-online ones because they are still from reputable, accredited post-secondary institutions."
3893,yup. what i was wondering as well
3894,"I considered going back to school but my only real choice would have been online due to work schedule.  My bosses (including director and SVP, SVP over ~900 people) said not to bother."
3895,"My friend is a hiring manager for a fortune 500 company- they dont hold only online degrees (Phoenix) up to same standard as an actual university, he wont hire anyone from online degree. Im not sure if everyone else is the same- but thought it was worth sharing."
3896,"Thanks, it confirmed what I thought from the beginning. No online courses for me."
3897,I work in project management and most of the reputable programs are delivered through online course work.  I've never had an issue and I am making a VERY comfortable living.
3898,"Hiring manager here. If I see U of Pheonix or any of that type, I treat it like no degree. Doesn't mean I think less of you, but I don't think much of your degree."
3899,Really? I feel like that's kind of harsh. Some people don't have the option to physically go to school. Do you at least give them a chance based on other qualifications?
3900,Are people just missing the part where I was talking about for profits?
3901,"> I feel like that's kind of harsh

Wahhhh too bad. It's a business. I'll take the state school kid over online scam colleges 99 times out of 100"
3902,"And you are qualified to make that determination how?  No offense, but some folks have no other choice but to go online.  Dismissing their resume out of hand because of where they got their degree seems a bit uppity. 

For instance, I worked two jobs supporting a family while going to school online.  What I learned there was as academically challenging as any B&M school would offer, if not more.  I got a degree in business, Project Management, and was able to pass the PMI CAPM and PMP tests on the first try within the following few months.  I also kick ass at my job.  

Biggest difference between B&M and Online?  My son is going to school now.  He touts the ""Social experience"" and ""Collaborative environment"".
What?  Binge Drinking at Frat Parties?  I'm 50 years old, own five houses and served 22 years in the Army.  Earned 5.2 Million dollars for my company as a contractor, and the fucking HR filters wouldn't get me to an interview until I had a BS degree.  

Just about pisses me off when someone says that going to a Brick and Mortar school while being a twenty something single kid with parents and financial aid paying the bills is harder or somehow more  challenging than keeping a roof over a family, working 60 hours or more a week to replace the 100K job you lost, being a father and a husband, and having to properly research and cite every thing you write, meet weekly objectives, papers, projects, postings, all properly researched and cited."
3903,"Ok, but why didn't you go to an online program from a good school?

There are plenty of options."
3904,Exactly...U Phoenix is a bullshit school.... doing an online program and any reputable uni would be fine.. but Phoenix man.. come on
3905,"Who says I didn't?  I never specified my School.  (Columbia Southern University, FWIW) 

My point is, I'm good at what I do- but your company would never have the opportunity to know that because you'd have tossed my resume in the trash, because you ""Don't trust the degree"".  

Like I pointed out to the smart ass HR kid that I had to interview with along the process of getting the job I have now- he graduated from UCLA.  Mom and Dad paid for it.  He didn't have a job through college except for internships.  He didn't have a mortgage, a kid going through school that HE had to pay for, two other kids in middle and high school, bills to pay, and two soul crushing jobs, a family to hold together, four rental houses to maintain, He didn't have to do anything but make it to class, turn in roughly the same amount of work I did, if not less.  And I am not complaining...I just had all the responsibilities that grown folks do, and people who counted on me.  

Now who's better at managing time, allocating resources, prioritizing tasks, not to mention leading others?  At least, who's *demonstrated* that?"
3906,"It is harder. That's the thing people who didnt go to a 4 year college don't get. It takes 4 years out of your life where you can do nothing but school. That's why 4 year colleges are held in higher regard because the people that attended them sacrificed working for four years to get the degree. 

College was never meant to be something to do in conjunction with work. College was meant to be something where you went to learn skills to work. It was never a given. It required legitimate sacrifice of your life to obtain a degree and that's why the people who hold regular 4 year degrees observe online ones that way. 

Imagine being flat broke and only able to work 15 hours a week for four years and doing nothing but school."
3907,"Meanwhile, imagine having a family, a mortgage, and a job while attempting to go back to school. I'm not sure you can consider that easy in comparison to going to university. I worked full-time while taking 4-5 classes per semester when I was getting my BA and I still don't envy people who have to sacrifice any semblance of freetime in order to go back to school as an adult. People in both situations face their own unique set of difficulties and it's impossible to make any kind of blanket statement about who has it worse."
3908,Dude who are you arguing with? Obviously college is easier if you're not married and raising kids..
3909,"Ah.  Yeah, I can see that.  Those poor kids I see moseying about at CNU look so poor and downtrodden.  Legitimate Sacrifice?  Most of those kids have no clue what a legitimate sacrifice is.  What, exactly are you ""sacrificing""?  

I'd have loved to go to college right out of high school.  Spent that dreamy time taking care of my mother until she died of cancer.  Pity I couldn't have made that college sacrifice.  After that, I enlisted into the Army.  Now THAT was a cake walk.  All those leadership skills just handed to me on a platter, rather than having to earn them like those poor hardworking college kids.  All those technical skills just dropped into my lap while those poor college kids had to slave over their classes.  

22 years of that, much of it running organizations larger than most companies, and as I grow older, marriage, kids, always moving, wars, etc...but that holds no ""prestige"" within your circles.  

But you betray your ignorance with the statement ""College was never meant to be something to do in conjunction with work""  No, it wasn't.  Once upon a time, the social elite sent their kids to colleges and universities because they could, while common folk went in for a trade, if they were lucky, or just did whatever they could to survive.  The commoner going to college was seen as an anomaly, and he was despised for it, generally.  

You asked me to imagine being flat broke for four years and only able to work 15 hours a week...  Now you imagine having two kids at home and one in college, a mortgage on a 3500 square foot house in a decent neighborhood because you don't want your kids to have to do what you did to get started in life.  Imagine stroking check after check for your wife's tuition, because at the time you have a job making more money than most college grads could dream of making- but not taking your turn just yet.  Then the bottom falls out of the economy, and that job goes away.  Imagine working 12 hours, getting home, and firing up a computer for another three or four hours.  Do that for a couple of years.  Imagine selling off things you worked hard for so you can buy a car for your son to take to college...that you just sold a motorcycle to pay tuition to so he wouldn't have to take out a loan...and selling another motorcycle for the next semester...losing shit you earned the money to pay for...and still working at a shit job many levels below where you should be because there's people out there with Bachelors degrees like yours that just don't get it...college is a breeze compared to real life.  Sacrifice?  Until you've driven yourself to utter exhaustion to provide others a better life than you did, you have no clue what sacrifice is.  You really don't.  

I was a project manager running a portfolio of projects long before I hung up the uniform.  I was an operations manager, and more than that, I was a leader, in charge of real people, real deadlines, real budgets-something no college kid ever has the opportunity, much less the ability to do...but people like you cling to that paradigm without the slightest clue as to what life really is.  Yet in corporate America, you become the gatekeepers.  HR Punks with ""regular"" degrees, without a clue as to how to evaluate the quality of a potential job applicant.  You discard anyone who has had to take a route different from yours, hit the delete key when sifting through resumes, and then sending corporate recruiters to job fairs to find someone that looks and talks like you. 

Yeah, I went to college online.  Difference between me and you, I had *context* to apply to my studies.  The best you could hope for is to be able to remember a fraction of whatever you learned in school when the situation arises where you can apply it.  

You scan a resume for ten seconds, then toss it, or like you, thinking less of a person because they got their degree online- regardless of the school.  You honestly think you did the right thing by your company?  You honestly think you fairly and accurately evaluated that person to determine if they were the best fir for the job?  No.  You didn't.  Same applies for thinking you are somehow superior to someone because of how they got their degree.  All you did was look down on someone because they don't look like you."
3910,"At first, as I was reading through this thread, I was feeling bad for deciding to do a trade instead of school and go for the online degree. Almost like everyone was superior to me. I've been struggling with this for a while, questioning my choices and everything. And even though my reasons and experiences are much different than yours, you have helped me out a lot. Definitely gave me a boost of confidence. Just wanted to say thanks :D"
3911,"FWIW 

I enlisted in the navy as a corpsman out of high school. I made it up to E6 and went to the university while in the reserves. I spent over a year in Iraq when I was in my early twenties.

 Please spare me the i didnt drive myself to the point of utter exhaustion to give someone a better life cause i lived it ever waking moment as a hospital corpsman. 

I gave up my active duty salary and orders to Europe in order to get a quality education because I knew how important education was to me.  Now I'm an officer on my 9th year of service. 

I had plenty of context to apply my studies. Shit I did my masters thesis on Iraq after I spent so much time there. 

I don't think less of the person, I just don't hold their degree in the same regard because they aren't the same.  There is no comparison between the degrees."
3913,"my thoughts exactly, plus HR doesn't assume that an online degree equals you have more hardships and work harder..."
3914,A good portion of my job is HR related. Everything matters when presenting yourself to a company. Seeing that online degree on your resume is not a positive...
3916,"Actually that depends. Some colleges, such as embry riddle, offer degrees online but their diploma and transcripts say worldwide campus distance Ed"
3917,It's the institution that matters.
3918,They will if it's an accredited school.
3919,"I have a bachelor's from University of Phoenix.  I think it all depends on the field you are going in to.  For me, the degree made my resume look good enough to get an interview so I could prove that I was a good fit for the company.  I was hired as a systems administrator by a company I love.  The only problem with my education is that I am now under a mountain of debt."
3920,I got a BS in IT from U of P also. Currently working as a programmer. It helped me get my foot in the door for sure.
3921,"If you're going to an online school, shouldn't the expenses be less?"
44152,HA!
3923,"Well, it's easier to pretend you bought the book when you actually didn't. Seriously, I bought only one book throughout getting my graduate degree. I did use the heck out of it, though."
3924,"I think, at UOP, the understanding is that you are essentially purchasing an easy degree.  It really was very little work, unfortunately.  You can learn more in two weeks on www.codeacademy.com then I learned in my classes."
3925,"agreed. The debt is killer, but i had no other choice in the matter. I was out on my own and had to work full time to pay my bills while going to school."
3926,how much does a degree from U of P cost?
3927,"[Here you go.](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/university-of-phoenix-phoenix-hohokam)

4 year degrees usually fall into the 120 credit region, which makes a UoP degree cost around $50,000."
3928,"Holy hell. I was wrong about what this program is for. I thought you paid 1,000 a year and got the paper that says you're educated now."
3929,"Really, for 4 years, that's not too bad, considering."
3930,I took a course online through a local college while working full time. I didn't end up completing the course for other reasons but I had a great experience. I was able to contact instructors at any time and could study and complete my work when I saw fit. All of the course material was provided and we had regular chat room sessions with instructors and other students in the same program to make sure we were all on the same page. If you're someone who can keep yourself on task and get yourself to complete assignments on your own then an online course might work for you. However if you need a classroom environment and an instructor lecturing to you and keeping you on task then I don't recommend it.
3931,"thanks for the reply! I am thinking about starting exactly for the learning side of it, i also believe you have to have good discipline, but I was also wondering about the job side of things. Do you think there are advantages/disadvantages of having your degree from an online school in terms of getting work in that area?"
3932,Well my school wasn't an online school so I'm not sure. It was a regular provincial college that offers the opportunity to take classes online as a part-time student. You may want to see of any colleges/universities in your area offer the same thing.
3933,Take online classes at an accredited college.  Don't do only online college.
3934,The big problem I see in online school is slacking off.  My brother slacked off and did very little of his work as it was all due by a certain due date that was like a year ahead.  By last week he had a month's worth of work done and ten or eleven months to do in three weeks.  He's stayed awake with a combination of medicine and catnaps and I'm kind of worried about him.
3935,catnip: not even once.
3936,That's why it isn't for everyone. You have to be really self motivated and manage your school work schedule all on your own.
3938,"I took online classes from an online college- I went 3 years (work was reimbursing me at 100% for that college) and transferred so my degree was from an accredited university, of which I took the classes online. Loop hole!"
3939,"Former recruiter here. While selecting resumes, the employment agency I worked for ALWAYS preferred someone who got a degree from a ""physical"" college over someone who got an online degree (like Phoenix University). I've heard it been referred to as a ""Mickey Mouse College"". But, an online degree is better than no degree, so you're still winning."
3940,"Yeah it is called Mickey mouse college and it's soley because you don't have to do any ""real"" research.  When I was working for my under grad I put in at least 300 hrs into research and the student's who didn't give a shit put in at least 100 hrs into research...  The whole idea of research is to train you how to think rather than to follow in the foot steps of others and hopefully that's what corporations want."
3941,"Absolutely perfectly. I have my master's degree in nursing education and work as a nurse educator for a large magnet status organization. 

I would never sit in an actual classroom ever again."
3943,Western Governors University
3944,My firm hired a woman who had a masters degree in accounting from the university of phoenix. she was bad. really bad. She didn't even know the most basic accounting procedures and was fired after a month.
3945,made me lol
3947,What in the fuck? An online law degree? Can you even take the bar with that?
3948,Some states allow you to take the bar exam without a law degree.
3950,I didn't even know online law schools existed. That's why I asked.
3951,"Went for almost two years without a decent job interview.  I had a lot of experience as a retired soldier and contractor, but no degree.  When my contract went away due to budget cuts, I couldn't buy a job interview.  Within one month of finishing my degree, I had three solid job offers, all within my field.  

Edit:  I did learn quite a bit, and felt that the classes were academically challenging as well as current.  Looking forward now to starting and completing my Master's degree."
3952,"I got my master's degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois. I took mostly online courses because I registered for classes late and they were my only option.  This turned out to be advantageous because the classes were 2 hours instead of 3 like the on-campus classes. The online classes met on campus one day each semester to account for shorter class time. 

A lot if schools are offering online classes that are just as valid as if you attended on-campus. Makes it easy when you have a job in addition to school. 

In terms of finding a job with my degree: one month after I finished my degree, I found a high level job as Associate Director and Head of Reference at a library in the area I wanted to live. 

I'm so glad I got my degrees, even if I don't use them directly in my current career. I gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunities or encountered the scenarios to learn otherwise. 

Tldr: I got a masters and I'm quite glad that I did."
3953,"Quick question for you, unrelated to this thread, how is the job market for librarians these days? I'm considering changing fields in a few years and would love it if I could have this as an option."
3954,"It really depends on where you're at. You should do some research for your state's library association and see if they have any job listing pages or resources. 

If you're not limited to one location in particular or you're not married to the idea of working in a typical library setting, it's a lot easier to find a position. The degree prepares you for a lot more than just the library field. It's basically a degree in research and ethical information management / dissemination. 

You can specialize if you know you want to go into a field that has more to do with archiving or serving a particular community or data management.  It's a great degree to have. 

If you're set on working in a specific library setting, it gets harder. I wanted to work with teens at a public library near Boston and lucked into my job where I built a teen services department. 

Don't expect to be a wealthy person if this is the path you choose. Library funding is scarce in the first place and jobs frequently get cut or reduced. 

I moved to LA and opted to switch careers because the market was very tough here at the time. 

It was a very rewarding time in my life but I don't think I'll be returning to that career any time soon."
3955,"I have an elementary education degree from Phoenix. I got a long term subbing job before I even graduated and am now teaching full time (got this job five months after I graduated, once hiring for this school year began). 

That being said, I did three years of my schooling at a private Christian university in my home state. I went to UoP because I was freshly married to a man in the military and we had to move and I had no idea "" real schools"" had online programs. I hated UoP and I worried I wouldn't get a job. Luckily people can tell I'm not a dipshit. Networking is also important."
3956,"I received a degree from The University of Maryland University College online a couple years back, I do not attribute my high pay to the degree, but it is a decent accomplishment. In the eyes of employers, it is that you finished what you started. The degree is in Cybersecurity, coupled with many industry certifications, I make close to 100k in the states, and over 200k overseas contracting. Mind you I am only 26. It is what you make of it. Depends on how far you want to go within your career, and why you are picking an online program. My advice, if you can, go traditional PT. If you are unable, kids, jobs, remote location, then online is a fine runner up.  With all that being said, most of the comments are correct about online for-profit vs. non-profit. Schools like UMUC, are part of the State of Maryland University system, most people won't bat an eye if you but University of Maryland-UC on your resume, there is also College Park, Baltimore and a couple other schools in that system. But places like Phoenix and Virginia College, which or private-for-profit institutions, I would stay away from."
3957,"UMUC is thankfully part of the UM system, so I've never heard any employer/person doubt its rigor. Many of its graduate programs seem to be tailor made for people connected to the DoD/IC community.

Still think UMUC is a hilarious name."
3958,"The Open University in the UK is known for long-distance/online learning. I know some nice people who teach there, and people with degrees from there can make it on to do good things. However, I don't think it's 'for profit' like some online courses. If anyone is interested in online learning you should check it out."
3959,I have an interview with Best Western as a desk guy
3960,"I have an online degree from a non-online school. No schools in my state offered a Masters in the program I wanted to attend, so I applied to a bunch of random schools. I was accepted into one of the big programs, basically if you have an interest in historic preservation, this is where you go. Unfortunately, tuition was way outside my grasp, but the online program was a lot more affordable.

I ended up finishing my program while working for a historic preservation group. When I started applying for jobs, I got a lot of wtf comments from employers because I had to explain that I worked full-time and finished my program at the same time. Hell, I took a full course load, worked 40 hours a week, and worked on my thesis all at the same time.

Did it work out for me? Not really. I ended up falling into freelance work. I write for some companies online, published a book completely unrelated to my field, and haven't worked in historic preservation in around four years or so. I still love the field, but I got screwed my a former ""supervisor"" who I tried and later threw me under the bus. The school itself talked up the program and kept mentioning how its grad professors were almost all former grads of the program. Turns out that they almost never have any open positions, so I couldn't apply for work there. Most grad schools have a small number of teachers and jobs as professors almost never turn up. I loved the program and still love historic preservation, but my life definitely didn't turn out the way I intended."
3961,"I got a degree in Film; against the advice of most friends and family. After a year and a half of food service jobs I've been working in the film/TV industry for over 2 years now. Both casting for several notable TV series and movies (Warner Bros, HBO, NBC, CW) and working hands on on-set for several feature films and TV shows (Dark Knight Rises, Walter Mitty, Law and Order SVU, Girls, Amazing Spider-Man 2, etc) 

My only main issue is that I'm already jaded by the way the industry works as a whole. And it may be too late to find another industry to work in (would love to work in Video Games)."
3962,My wife is currently making $89k a year with her online degree.
3963,Do professors hate her?
3964,pretty sure they liked her.
3965,Where did she get her degree and what is her degree in?
3966,"This thread is depressing. I busted my ass for four years and graduated with a 4.0 to earn my B.S. I wrote papers, diagrammed fingerprints, diagrammed crime scenes, dusted for prints, studied chemicals, took tests, did homework, bought and read all of the books, took part in real-time class seminars where I interacted with my professors, took notes, and still retain a large portion of the degree-related information. It's frustrating to know that people in positions to hire me will trash my resume just because I earned my degree online."
3967,"Just out of curiosity, how did you do things like diagramming crime scenes, dusting for print, study chemicals, etc online?"
3968,"I had to draw and then scan the diagrams and email them into the professors. Dusting for prints we did with what we had on hand. I used crushed pencil graphite and was able to pull some excellent prints with that. The chemicals were studied via books, watching videos, etc."
3969,Well what university is the degree from?
3970,Kaplan University
3971,"A friend of mine is a police officer and she's getting her B.S. in something criminology related from Kaplan.  As far as I know she's set to get promoted after getting her degree or something.

Good luck to you!  My suggestion would be to network with classmates/professors at Kaplan, see what they can do for you in your area in terms of getting real work experience or job placement.  Seriously, I wish you the best of luck, it's tough when you get shot down without even being given a chance."
64615,Thank you so much!
3973,"You're welcome :) Us online learners need to support each other.  I don't know how much help I can be, but if you need help with anything send me a PM.  I'm somewhat resourceful."
3974,I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thank you!
3975,"I don't think they trash it if it's from a traditional, accredited university with an online program. The ones most people are talking about here are for-profit online schools, like the University of Phoenix."
3976,It's from Kaplan University.
3977,"Kaplan at least has regional accreditation, unlike U of Phoenix, which is nationally accredited. National accreditation is generally reserved for for-profit schools, and don't hold much weight. Regional accreditation holds significantly more value."
3978,"Capella is also a for-profit school but has regional accreditation (and many of their programs are accredited by the institutions that offer licensure like CACREP for counselors, etc.)."
3979,Ah! Thanks for the information.
3980,"My coworker is a teller and he has a MBA from University of Phoenix. Usually with a MBA, one instantly becomes a branch manager or regional manager."
3981,"Uhhh, not true at all. In banking, it's experience and proven track record in numbers that gets you a job. 

I've been in banking for years."
3982,Ex-banker here. Can confirm.
3983,MBA is worthless unless it's from a brand name school and/or backed by years of experience.
3984,I got my law degree from some shady online college. I got fired and now I go to a community college with some loveable misfits.
3985,'Community' reference!?
3986,"Online certification (e.g. project management or SPSS) or online coursework from a reputable institution is much different from an online degree from a diploma mill. If I see Walden, Phoenix, Capella, or any of their ilk, the resume goes in the trash. In my field, the degrees from these places aren't even properly accredited, and I've witnessed coworkers who can't string together a paragraph getting master's degrees and PhDs."
3987,"Have you tried taking a course at one of these institutions? I would suggest you do so before casting its students aside-- you could be passing up the opportunity to hire some very innovative and well-put-together people.  It takes a tremendous amount of self-discipline to go through a 2 or 3 year program online with little to no social support, work a full-time job on top of that, and for a lot of students they are also parenting at the same time.

Don't knock it til you've tried it."
3988,Point taken. I've had multiple bad experiences with coworkers and other folks who received degrees through these programs. I don't doubt there are intelligent and capable people in programs like this.
3990,"I have to agree.  I'm in Capella's Mental Health Counseling program, which is CACREP accredited as well and it takes quite a bit more time and effort than most of my psychology classes did when I was an undergraduate at a reputable private school.

As an undergrad I probably ended up with good grades just because I showed up to class, was respectful, and at least tried to do my work.  And office hours.  As an online student I can't kiss ass quite like that.  So it's all hard work."
3991,"I stand corrected re: the accreditation. It's hard to get over multiple bad personal experiences with any institution, though, and the fact that folks like my coworker were able to graduate doesn't speak well for the program, I'm afraid. Some of the cover letters I've received from graduates of Capella and Walden have been riddled with typos, run-on sentences, and so on. 

Sorry if I sound like an elitist asshole, but I'm just relaying my experience as a hiring manager. Clearly, there are some talented and intelligent folks attending these programs, so I'll do my best to be more open-minded next time there's an open position on my team."
3992,"I highly appreciate the fact that you will do your best to be open-minded in the future (and so will future applicants, I believe). 

You stated it is hard to get over multiple bad experiences with any institution; are you letting your personal feelings affect your professional work?

You also said ""some of the cover letters....from graduates of Capella and Walden..""; did cover letters from other (brick and mortar) schools have perfect cover letters? (I am speaking about every. single. cover. letter. ever. received. from. said. schools.)


I'm not trying to start a war with you (concerning this, or any other thing); I am just curious how integrating personal experiences, with any institution, is beneficial as a hiring manager ?

3994,"I'm studying nursing via distance ed, and its really good. In all honesty I am really slack with the studying as I have a toddler and am two months pregnant, so seem to leave assignments to the last minute, but I have still been achieving high marks so apparently I am understanding the course work. 

Because my university offers it both on campus and off campus I doubt it will affect my job prospects at all when I'm finished, as its exactly the same degree. 

And for those wondering it is a Bachelor of nursing to become an RN, not an EN course"

3996,"I have friends who work in staffing and HR and they have told me the completely online colleges you see commercials on tv for might separate you from someone with just a high school diploma or GED, but won't come close to putting you on an equal playing field as someone with a degree from a non for profit accredited college.  

Im not saying legit colleges and universities don't offer certain classes online.  They certainly do, but the majority is still in the classroom I'm pretty sure.  Pretty much if you can't take the credits and use them to transfer to say a local state school (if ur in usa), it's not worth your time or money"
3997,"This is a hard one to answer as I had the career first. As far as that's concerned the degree, and the certs, are assisting immensely. Online school, nonprofit, nationally and regionally accredited, is great. I have tried the for profits and agree with the top poster, they do nothing to ready you for the real world. This school does a fantastic job of trying to prepare you for real life. It focuses a great deal on the assessment end of things but, the tests are applicable, in the IT majors many finals are industry cert exams, bonus. Only about half of the courses have an exam at the end, the others you're expected to turn in a document of some kind. I did a science paper and turned in video and pictures with the project, very contemporary. 


If you're interested in online school and think you have the self discipline, do your research, find a quality online degree program, with reputable  accreditation and the experience is great. Self discipline is not optional, no one is there holding your hand.

I have purposefully not mentioned the school by name, I don't want to be accused of being a plant of some kind. If you can't find them with the details I've given (basically it's the only school that meets this criteria), PM me."
3998,"I'm in a program at a state brick and mortar school that offers all of my program's classes online. It's great for people who need to be flexible and have their shit together. The diploma is the same, the material is the same and they stream the in class lectures. I however took one of the classes online instead of learning in the classroom and discovered that online learning isn't my thing. It requires a greater deal of motivation, and alas I am a weak individual in that department. If you know you can do it, go for it; it really boils down to knowing yourself and your learning style. I'm content to rue the stupid B+ I got in that online class."

4009,"I'm currently getting my master's degree through the distance learning program at a state university. As many have already said, getting a degree through a program like this at an actual university is almost the exact same as getting the degree on-campus. The main difference is what attracts most people to online education: you get to do everything when it's convenient for you (while still observing due dates for assignments, obviously).

I actually completed the majority of my bachelor's degree requirements online (for my major, not just core classes), and no one's questioned the legitimacy of my degree. The application process for my current program was actually more rigorous than for the on-campus programs (at other schools) that I applied to - you can tell they take it just as seriously.

tl;dr pretty well so far"
4014,"I'm a HR Manager now, but when I was an assistant, I can tell you that when reviewing resumes and we saw ""Education: University of Phoenix"", it went straight into the trash/shred box. Now that I'm a manager I have more say so. If you just have a degree from UofP, I'm probably not bringing you in, but if you also have a steady work history along with it, I'll consider bringing you in."
4015,"Phoenix. I work in software, there are plenty of self-educated people in software who point to cool things they have built when someone doubts their education. I would say 80% of what I know I learned independently. The school work was very easy - if you ever got tutored in a subject to get ahead (as opposed to catch up) you know what I mean - when you're far enough ahead every thing you write/type is as easy and natural as name and date.

I really enjoyed this arrangement, I read a lot of great books on the topics of my classes and played around with every language and tool we were using, and more. I also worked, a lot, to support myself and to pay for school. I didn't end up building anything cool enough to be proud of on my resume while in school, but my internship (not school-related) turned into my first real job at a very cool company after I finished school. In effect all I got from school was a shove into some aspects of my field that I thought were lame and boring (some things take a few years to grow on you, like your parents and writing documentation) and a piece of paper that doubled my hours, my pay, and gave me benefits.

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANY FIELD BESIDES SOFTWARE

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANYONE BESIDES THE SELF-MOTIVATED

If you're not all of the above, forget my happy outcome and read some other responses.

*EDIT:* I really have to re-state, in CompSci you can learn and practice everything with a computer and an internet connection. I can't think of another field where this applies. I wanted to finish college because:

1. Sitting down and learning a subject without a guide is hard.

2. I didn't really believe I could get hired as a self-taught person.

If you are in the same situation as me, I would advise:

1. Take free CS courses from MIT, Harvard, and all the other amazing universities that offer them. One of them actually offers a degree (with lots of asterisks) now.

2. Find people who want to collaborate on cool things. Small cool things. Things you think you could finish in a 20-hour day. (You will learn a hard truth that you've always thought didn't apply to you.)"

4019,"My dad got his masters from University of Phoenix, and currently teaches fourth grade."
4020,">Are there any fully online accredited colleges, hopefully affordable, where I could possibly transfer my existing credits and come out with a degree that is respectable?

You could see if any local universities offer online programs. Most 'colleges' that are marketed as fully online, inexpensive, and a fast track into IT are not what I'd call respectable. You could also try to go for some certs instead; you'd likely end up more knowledgeable than with an online program. 

maybe try /r/itcareerquestions"
4021,I've debated with myself going with certs or the degree but I want to finally get my degree since almost every job I see requires it.  I can always swing back and get certs for a specif job requirement.
4022,"This. Most every local university has an online option now. Go with a traditional school and you'll get a degree worth something. Some of the online only schools are ok, but many are a waste."
4023,"Like others have said, go with a brick and mortar institution that offers online degrees.  So many schools do this now.

I'm enrolled at Champlain College for MS in Infosec. 
  
I originally started at Capella and switched after the first class to the traditional school.  I literally Google'd something like  ""top online masters programs"" and weeded out any school that wasn't brick and mortar, then researched the pros and cons from there."
4024,That was my plan with my local community college but at least half of the required classes aren't offered online for some reason.  I'll check some of the other colleges and see what they look like.
4025,"1. is the school regionally accredited?
2. is the school non-profit?
3. does the school also have brick and mortar locations?

if the answer to all of those are yes, then it's probably not considered a joke"
4026,"WGU. 

Western Governor's University.  About 5000 a year - you can take as many classes as you want, just have to complete 12 units each 6 month. AWESOME one on one support by a dedicated mentor. All the materials are provided, including things like CBTnuggets, Boson test preps, lab simulators, etc. The books are electronic so I did buy a handful of books - especially for the Cisco.

I have gotten two promotions and tripled my salary since I started. Best thing I ever did.

I have a B.S. in IT with security emphasis. The finals for ALL of the IT classes are passing the certifications which are including in the tuition. I got credit for my existing A+, Security + and my AA in Networking from the local Tech College, so started as a Junior. (at age 52)

4037,"Here's what I did. I've had a pretty successful career but not having a degree really bugged me. After a lot of trial and error. I went back to school at 26 (now 31 and finally close to graduation) and I highly recommend the following path:

- Enroll at you local Community College first. Most community colleges offer almost completely online programs today. The advantage of a community college is that you have an actual brick and mortar school to drive to to meet with tutors and professors, while still doing almost all your classes online. This also give you the option of taking more difficult/interesting classes in person. If you worried about your age you'll learn CC varies from 18-65. Also this will save you a ton of money. Not to mention in some cases an AA degree from a CC might be worth more than a for profit online degree. 

- After enrolling at the local community college look at your states online college program. For instance in my area we have UMUC (University of Maryland) and Penn State Online. Most state college systems offer an online program linked to your actual school system. This makes transferring credits seamless. I would dual enroll in CC and your states online almost right away. Most will have a transition program so not a single credit is wasted and you'll earn a AA after your second year. Even though UMUC for example blitzs our market with ads at least I know its not for profit like UoP.

- It sounds like your career is setup well, but most IT programs have classes based on certifications. I would recommend taking the cert after the class. For example a typical ""network security"" class will link directly to Security+ cert.

- Suck it up and realize it will take 4-6 years even online, but we live in a golden age online education and you'll find a vast amount offered from free sources to help out. 

Good Luck!"
4038,I'm an instructor at a CC and I agree with this. CC's now have many online programs and its an accredited degree that will allow you to enroll in a state university.  You really do have to watch out for the ITT tech's Phoenix and other non-accredited diploma mills.
4039,"Excellent advise. Thank you.

>It sounds like your career is setup well, but most IT programs have classes based on certifications. I would recommend taking the cert after the class. For example a typical ""network security"" class will link directly to Security+ cert.

Very well. Funny, I have Sec+, Net+, MCSA and CISSP already :)"
4040,Some schools will give you transfer credit for your certifications as well.
4041,"Makes those classes cake. I had certs before I went to college, and those classes we super easy."
4042,"There may be cheaper options (if you're not a PA resident).  Western Governor's is an accredited online-only college, so the pacing, flexibility, and tuition can all be better for someone with a job and a family.

http://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/programs

I haven't enrolled at WGU (I applied and got auto-rejected for not having a HS diploma even though I have a Master's), but I studied out various options fairly thoroughly a few years ago, and it is definitely worth looking at.  I did my Master's online through GATech, which was fine but really nothing more than video-taped classroom lectures, so I couldn't fully recommend it.  Programs that focus on online education are going to have better resources and support for you."
4043,"WGU is amazing if you're looking at IT, you get a ton of certifications as you go through the program- I admit I am biased because I work there, but OP's situation sounds exactly like most of the students I get- if you want more information you can PM me."
4044,"Consider Excelsior College, regionally accredited and nonprofit: http://www.excelsior.edu/programs/technology"
4045,"I went to a community college then a university to end up getting a bachelors and masters in Spanish, which you pretty much can't do online.

I had two friends do online college.

1 went to some unknown online university, spent $$$$$ and graduated and its not taken seriously because nobody recognizes it and its only online so I think some people don't trust them or something.  She has had a terrible time and she's in debt-a lot. 

My other friend went to an actual college that has a good online program.  She takes one in person class and the rest she does online.  It's called the PACE program for working adults but its an actual, accredited university here (she could in any semester actually take in person classes if she wants to or if something isn't offered online) and she is almost done and already has a job lined up. 

I think the difference is just respect for their effort (because who knows who did the work in the completely online classes) and recognition of the school.  Also, my friend at the actual university ended up spending less! 

Good for you for going back-just be smart about it! And definitely look into pell grants! And don't go to any school that isn't accredited.  

My ex boyfriends mother went to one of those 12 month nursing school things and it wasn't accredited so the only places that will hire her are the companies that work with that school...and she can't use the year if she decided to actually become a nurse, which she won't but it wouldn't even be an option to transfer.  

Good luck!!"
4046,"I'm so glad I found this post/subreddit. I'm in a similar situation in that I have a decent job, yet unsatisfying and doesn't pay well enough for the long haul. I have some school under my belt, but want to finish my undergrad in CS now, hopefully with a software development focus.

I've been doing a lot of self-learning, but now that I qualify for my employers' tuition reimbursement program I want to take advantage of that. But I don't just want a piece of paper from a ""diploma mill."" I want to be challenged and actually *learn* whole I'm in school (novel, I know).

But the only way I see it working is online. I'll be working full time and have a baby on the way. But it's so hard to judge an online school before enrolling. Every school has such polarizing reviews. And aside from that, there are just so many factors to consider.

But I'm going to look into some of these schools listed. This is why I like Reddit…"
4047,"Everybody fucks up, to a degree.  Man, I'd love to go back and do my Bachelor's all over.  But now... I have my MS and I'm a college professor.  There was another professor at this school who only had a high school degree and was a forklift driver.  She got hurt on the job, had to go on disability, was all like fuck this, and now has a PhD and is a writing professor.  Fucking up doesn't mean you're screwed for life, and it doesn't matter how old you are or where you are in your education.

The important thing to remember about online education (I teach in a Master's program online) is that, while convenient, it is just as intense, involved, challenging, and time-consuming (or even more time-consuming) as regular face-to-face courses.  Most students do not realize this.  To be candid, if I had a student with a demanding full-time job and a baby on the way, I'd counsel them to wait. I'd counsel them VERY STRONGLY.  If, however, you're getting a degree and you need to take those bothersome courses that duplicate your certificate knowledge, they might be a lot easier; this would make your studies easier, content-wise.  Also pay attention to courses with synchronous (ie, ""live"") components.  If your life is such that you cannot log onto a class every Tuesday night at 7 p.m. (and it will be 7 p.m. local time to the university teaching the course - keep that in mind), it's not a reasonable thing to do.

And do watch out for reputation and credibility of the institution, as previous Redditors have mentioned.  We are unimpressed if we get applications from people who got their degree at Phoenix or Walden.  It's easy enough to see evaluations of specific programs online.

If the Redditors below are making recommendations based on experience, that's excellent!"
4048,"I did Designlab’s UX design course, with an art history BA under my belt, and went from making 40k in a career with a low ceiling to 70k with a high ceiling for salary. Took me 1 year from beginning to getting hired."
4049,Did you do the UX academy? The USD 5999 one? Can you please share your experience doing the course? I am really interested!Thanks :)))
4050,"Yes that’s the one!

I had a very positive experience, and I absolutely recommend the course. I was skeptical because it’s less recognized than General Assembly or some of the others. Also, there seems to be mixed perspectives as far as how valuable and worthwhile these courses are. You’ll see plenty of UX professionals on Reddit saying how they never hire people from these courses, etc. So naturally I was concerned, but took those statements with a grain of salt and pursued it anyways.

I think my experience was so positive because of my mentor. He was super communicative, encouraging, and empathetic, not to mention incredibly intelligent and successful. 

At the end of the course, I had completed an online portfolio and had gained the language to speak confidently about user experience design. Took me a couple months to land a job, but immediately landed a job after going through a staffing agency. 

Overall, completing the course through designlab truly set my life on the path I had wanted for so long. I’m now in an industry that challenges me, and every day I feel so fortunate to have had the fortitude to pursue what I wanted and to have actually landed a job. That being said, I am super passionate about understanding people on a very human level, problem solving, and working with others. I love giving people positive experiences, so the industry very much matches my personality. Definitely do your research before committing to one of these programs because once you commit, you really have to be prepared to work your ass off, even after the course ends. Interviews for these jobs are no joke. 

Can I ask, why do you wish to pursue one of these programs? What is driving you to want to enter this field?"
4051,"I work in an office with some artists turned UX. When I asked each of them that question individually, they all told me different versions of ""I was tired of being poor""."

4053,"Thank you so much for your detailed reply. For me the reason I have been looking into UX courses (I actually considered GA but it’s outrageous how much that costs) is because since a very young age (I am 30 now) I am always looking at websites or even just everyday products and think how to improve them and make them more user friendly. I do that even with the documents I draft (I am now a paralegal). So when I came to know about UX I was like ohhhh sweet that sounds like something I would like. I do calligraphy and so I also pay a lot of attention to type face, color combinations and illustration on app interfaces, website or even just greeting cards haha. So yeah... haha I am so encouraged reading about your experience!! Very happy for you too!!"
4054,"Second this, I'm considering doing Springboards UX course for ~the same cost. I'm just leery about this paid online courses that *seem like schools* but are really just businesses offering an online product.

^ the key difference for me would be the applicable workforce skills and one-on-one mentorship support/structure other online courses don't offer.  

**Whats your experience been?"
4055,"I will say that with Designlab, the workforce skills you’re talking about were highly stressed. No lesson was presented without considering the functionality within an actual workplace. My mentor was constantly training me on how to answer stakeholder questions, etc. 

See my reply to the above comment for more details about my experience. Or feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions!"
4056,"Nice, congrats!"
4057,"Did you go through the whole program? Did you like it? What was the cost? I’ve seen similar programs and I’m considering it, but any insight would be helpful!"
4058,"I did go through the whole program. I loved it. I mean it helped me leverage my prior experiences (fine art sales and exhibit production) so that I’m making much more money in a much more interesting environment. My program was 6k and worth every penny. 

Definitely do your research on the industry and be confident the program is something you’re willing to commit to. It’s not enough to simply complete the program and expect a job to land on your lap. You definitely need to network and self educate and be genuinely interested in the work. The program is largely what you make it. You’ll get out of it what you’re willing to put in. Not to mention the hiring process for these jobs can be very demanding and there’s nine million other people just as driven and ambitious as you are with just as good portfolios competing for the same roles, so you need to find your edge and really lean into that. For me, it’s that I’m a great communicator and speaker, and add value to the teams I’m on because I am a great liaison between the stakeholders and the design team."
4059,"Very cool! I’m really excited to dive deeper into this. I have a background in film, photography and marketing so I think they are pretty transferable.

Even there I didn’t have really any networking opportunity, because I was locked out of those career growth things because of a low GPA. I’ve been in the work force for over 15 years, and wanted to get a grad degree in a better paying field, but I just wasn’t willing to pay the insane tuition costs, work on anyone else’s schedule, and sit through traditional classes. I work full time, commute 10 hours a week, and have a disability. Traditional education was not an option. A close friend recommended WGU, and I chose it as best for my needs. It isn’t easy, you have to be self-motivated, manage your time well, test well, write well to pass the classes. At the same time, they tell you exactly what they are looking for to prove competency on essays. They take out the bullshit of course work. I don’t think much about the networking stuff. I know there are groups that meet online within degree programs and within classes, you’re assigned a mentor, and there are course instructors. I believe they can help you network around. That said there are many ways to network, friends, family, colleagues, former employers, volunteer supervisors, meet up groups, church functions, LinkedIn, etc. My friend who recommended WGU to me never had a problem getting interviews or jobs with her degree, and I don’t expect to have an issue either. WGU now has several satellite affiliates and they are growing, companies offer tuition reimbursement for their programs, and they take industry standards seriously when determining competency. I understand your nervousness, I was also, and then I decided I just needed to do it so I could get a better paying job. It was the only real option for me. I can’t say that all is well yet because I haven’t graduated, but I fully expect to double my income once I graduate."

Because they are pay as you go.  They are the only schools that offer low monthly payments (or you can pay all at once per semester) and they do accept nearly all transfer credits. They are 100% online distance learning.  In fact they won't release your grades/allow you to enroll in the next semester until the current one is paid off.  Both colleges run about $1200-1300 for 5 courses/15 credits (3 credits each) and offer AA, BA and a couple masters degree options.

Both offer tutoring, online assistance and availability to instructors and fellow students to ask any/all questions you need to complete the lessons.  Cost is the same per student, regardless of where the live in the states

4127,"I think they are unfairly looked down upon. Depending on the class though I can see how there would be an advantage to have face to face classes vs online courses but that's another topic.

I think online courses are godsends for some people. It allows the student to work on their time schedule while still holding down a job and manage their personal life. It's hard to balance a job, a child, and school enough already. Online classes allow a more even balance for that individual.

I also know some older people that wouldn't go back to school for they feel it's too embarrassing to be a 40 year old in school again. 

One should never be embarrassed to take online classes and they shouldn't have to suffer afterwards for making the decision to get further education, no matter the source (as long as it's reputable of course)"

4129,"Not a hiring person, but generally if it's from an accredited program, it's the same as any other degree. You don't have to explain where you got it unless it's from a very recognizable ""diploma mill"" institution like University of Phoenix. 

I'm completing my bachelor's online through a local college. I chose it specifically because it's an actual brick-and-mortar institution that I can physically go to if I have an issue, which means a flesh-and-blood teacher and staff that I can talk to. Granted, I haven't been there physically in over two years -I'm what you'd call a turtle-paced undergrad, only taking 6 credits at a time. It's all I can afford, and all I can take mentally with working a full-time job. But hey, end result is going to be the same either way. 

I'm looking at doing my master's degree through John Hopkins University, and their program is online as well. When I get my M.A. it won't read ""JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY - FAKE-ASS PUSSY DIVISION"", it'll just say the name of the school.

About the college football program: a school that has one has an established grass-brick physical presence. And that's worth $ compared to one run out of a strip mall in Miami. Imagine if you're competing with someone and you have exactly the same skills, but your degree comes from a physically-established program as compared to a pure online school. You'll win the interview. Look at Park U if you need to go online (I'm not affiliated with them in any way) as an example."
4136,"Grand Canyon University is a for-profit school in the same vein as DeVry, Ashford, AMU, or University of Phoenix.  As others here pointed out, they just aren’t held to the same esteem as most regionally accredited schools. ~~In fact, I think the DoD even banned AMU from being eligible for TA for a while, because they were seen as predatory and offering an inferior education. (I think Betsy DeVos is trying to undo this, but I may be wrong.)~~ (proved wrong by /u/colabear19)

I was doing some research for military friendly schools myself a bit back - here’s a few I found to be reputable, most of which are tied to state brick-and-mortar universities.

~~- University of Maryland University College (I know, stupid name)~~ I should do more research. University of Maryland College Park has a stellar reputation, not necessarily University College, apparently

- Arizona State University (great for technical degrees! I worked with a lot of engineers in Silicon Valley who got their Computer Science undergraduate and master degrees from here)
- Colorado State University (ty, /u/russki !)
- Penn State University
- Ohio State University
- Oregon State University
- Utah State University
- Excelsior College (I believe they’re a private school, but they’re very accommodating to military folks. I believe a lot of Master Chiefs of the Navy graduated from here.)

Military friendliness is one important aspect, for sure. But a school's reputation is another important aspect. You can try looking through US News' online programs rankings to scrutinize for yourself. (Of course, they're just one of many resources).

Got to rep my school WGU though. 3k for 6 months, flat rate. Minimum of 12 credits in those six months, but you can bang out more if you want."
4152,"I finished up my degree at WGU this last week. Bachelors of Science, IT-Security. I have degrees from WGU AND a brick and mortar school. I can tell you several things, I learned more at WGU and felt significantly more accomplished at WGU because I didn't have my hand held. I have 10 different IT certifications and now work as a Security Officer. Not only has my degree never been questioned in interviews, it has actually been praised. Many of the smartest IT folks that I've worked with have WGU degrees. In fact that is where I got the idea to even look at WGU originally.   


Brick and mortar schools serve a purpose but they simply cannot stack up to the flexibility of WGU (did I mention I've been military for the lat 15 years as well?). You will pay more at a brick and mortar school, the certifications will not be part of your curriculum, and you will have less flexibility. WGU has the same accreditation as the University of Oregon and tons of others. I see users in here mentioning competition between you and another person, but you have a degree from an online school and they have one from a brick and mortar school, then say it is favorable for the non-online school. This is a made up scenario that doesn't happen, which is laughable. Why? Because WGU you do not get your hand held at all, you do all the work yourself. If any interviewer is worth their salt, they will know what goes into the more well-known school programs.    


TLDR: There isn't a wrong answer, just that the answer is going to different depending on what is right for you! Many people in here spewing what-if scenarios that don't happen in reality."
4153,"Attending AMU personally.  They have helped me do things such as work on a resume, got me into an apprenticeship program relating to my degree and took a bunch of elective credits based on being a submariner E5.  If you do any research, then yes some places do not personally like for-profit colleges while others do.  Difference in for-profit is the lack of focus on general education and more on specialized.  I do agree that a non-profit, state college-type-thing that also has an online program generally looks better.  However, AMU and Excelsior are both regionally accredited schools and are further accredited in specific programs by boards that mean something.  The most important part is to do research on that school prior to committing.  For instance, AMU got sued by the state of either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania (I cannot find it currently) for their failure to disclose post-completion employment data.  They did not lose their certification.  While I also agree that  for-profit colleges are a business, either way you are paying for a product.  WGU is another example.  They are regionally accredited  and their online teaching program is also one of the only online accredited ones.  I also know people at the company that I am apprenticing with that got their degrees through AMU as well as connections through sites like LinkedIn.  Online for-profits are generally more flexible with schedules as well.

TL:DR 

Do research and haters gonna hate on online college because they paid more or took on loans for their brick-and-mortar degree. A degree is mostly a check in the box and you need networking and experience.

Edit: There are pros and cons to for-profit and non-profit.  Research.

Edit 2: Graduation rates seem to be lower for online for-profit schools as there is less interaction.  If you are good at teaching yourself it may be for you. Results may vary."

My only real knock on it is that the built-in debugging is just adequate.

available for linux mac and other more difficult to use OS's [https://www.geany.org/](https://www.geany.org/)"
4190,I've removed the duplicates of this comment you posted.
4191,thanks I abandoned it in the end (assuming it wasn't posted) it kept saying there was a problem and hadn't seemed to post....
4193,"you should try out the IDE clion. It is free for students. I love it for C++, have little experience with it for C."
4194,Visual Studio Code.
4195,"My only complaint is the startup time, if I just want to change 1 config option or something the wait is annoying."
4196,"Yeah it's a bit slower than other options like sublime or np++ but its still way faster than a full IDE. It also scales nicely and the text font looks the best to my eyes. 

If you're doing a lot of text file based changes then I would just keep it running."
4197,Most other editors let you change the font. Don't judge a text editor based on its font until you have found out you can't.
4198,"I meant the way it renders the text, and scales it as you zoom in. Useful for HiDPI displays."
4199,Electron...
4200,"VSC is *way* faster than Atom and I have no idea how. The only thing I've (personally) seen conclusively beat at loading it is N++, honestly."
4201,"Yep, it is, but not as faster as Sublime yet :("
4202,"This answer also applies to OSX fwiw (haven't tried it on Linux, but maybe there too)"
4203,It is available for Linux too but I also haven't tried it on that platform.
4204,"I use it on Linux, works the exact same as windows/OSX"
