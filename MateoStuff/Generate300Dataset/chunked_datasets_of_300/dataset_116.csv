36958,"SFNE is my home park, and honestly I don't like Superman that much either because of the restraints."
36959,"From my least favorite to my favorite.

SFA - Only worth it to get the credits. I'll probably return when they RMC Roar.

SFNE - Good ride collection, horrible operations. When I was there (last time was Goliath's opening year I think), they were assigning seats on rides that had no lines. Will probably revisit at some point for Wicked Cyclone and to ride Superman again.

SFGAm - Large collection of rides, has the original Batman, Raging Bull is good, and Goliath is pretty good. Nothing really makes my top 10 steel though. Goliath comes in at number 7 wood for me which, despite being a weaker RMC, is still an RMC.

SFOG - This is a great little park with a quirky layout but very good ride collection. Scorcher is my favorite Stand-up, they have the best Batman (in my opinion). Dare Devil Dive is really underrated. Goliath and Mindbender are both amazing. The one drawback is that the wooden coasters are horribly rough. Both Cyclone and Scream Machine come in at the bottom of the 48 wooden coasters I've ridden. If they get retracked or RMCd, I'd be glad to go back down to experience the park again.

SFMM - This is a destination park. Sure, the coasters could be considered weaker than most, but the park it has a lot of coasters that are definitely in the top half of my rankings. The highlights here are Superman, the first coaster to reach 100 MPH, Tatsu, the most intense and probably best American flyer, and of course X2, which is my number 3 steel and has an experience that can't be described. Last time I was there was 2013, so I haven't experienced Twisted Colossus yet, and I've heard that it's really good as well.

SFGAdv - This and SFMM are really close for me but it really comes down to the fact that I visit SFGAdv more than any other Six Flags park because of how close it is to me. It has a pretty good line-up that has 3 half-decent B&Ms (Green Lantern, Superman and Batman), 2 really good B&M's (Nitro and Bizarro), two really good indoor family coasters (Dark Knight and Skull Mountain), a Vekoma Madhouse (Houdini is amazing), the tallest coaster in the fucking world (Kingda Ka), and one of the absolute best wooden coasters in the world (El Toro). The collection is amazing and makes up for the park's terrible layout. Seriously, El Toro is worth the trip there alone, and when you combine that with the rest of their lineup, you know the price you paid for admission was worth it.

I'll be going to SFStl for the first time this year, so we'll see where that stands."
36961,"SFMM looks a lot better than SFGAdv, which looks very overrated.  I'm not serious, because that's a dumb thing to say.  El Toro looks ridiculous.  

1.) Magic Mountain - Roller coasters galore.  Twisted Colossus fits smack dab in the middle of my top 10 roller coasters.  Full Throttle, X2, and Tatsu are all very good coasters as well, and they have a ridiculous selection following.

2.) SFGAm - A big selection of fun coasters.  Again, the RMC is a standout, but I also really enjoyed Raging Bull, X-Flight, Batman, and the wooden coasters.

3.) St. Louis - 

4.) Discovery Kingdom - 

5.) Elitch Gardens - when it was a Six Flags park."
36962,"I've been to Six. Going to SFGAdv this Summer. 

1. SFOG - With the ride collection and quality of SFGAm, the theming, landscape, and beauty of SFOT, and having my favorite roller coaster Goliath, this one tops it all. 

2. SFOT - The theming, interconnected-ness with the environment and landscape, and just an overall beautiful park with plenty of rides.

3. SFFT - Beautiful park with fun themed areas and a unique setting, and Iron Rattler is amazing. 

4. SFGAm - So many rides, but it's the second most Six-Flags-y out of these. (First is SFMM) 

5. SFStL - Quaint, cute, hilly, and comfy. A great collection of woodies, friendly staff, and just a cozy park with fun rides. Just not as much to do as the other parks, hence its low placement. 

6. SFMM - Terrible experience at this park. If you wanna know the story, ask."
36963,Actually I would like to know the story because I'm going there soon
36964,"The problem wouldn't happen now. I went at a different time. Superman was closed because of Lex Luthor being built. Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus weren't built yet. Tatsu broke down while we were in line. X2, the ride I was most looking forward to, was incredibly rough, music wasnt working, and was in no way pleasant. Scream is one of my least favorite coasters. Aside from RR and Apocalypse, everything else I found to be mediocre. Very dissapointing visit."
36965,"I think SFFT is very underated, it needs one show stopper coaster, and I think people would completely change there tune on it, I also think its the best themed six flags, and literally one of the top five amusement parks in terms of setting, having the rock wall to use in coaster layout is simply amazing."
36966,"""One show stopper coaster""

Like Iron Rattler or Superman Krypton?"
36967,"One other, I really Like both of those and there very good, but I mean something really special, something that stands out as being Fiesta Texas unique stand out coaster."
36968,"What happened at MM? I didn't have the best experience either. Nothing personal happened, the park just sucked for me lol"
36969,"Superman was closed because of Lex Luthor being built. Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus weren't built yet. Tatsu broke down while we were in line. X2, the ride I was most looking forward to, was incredibly rough, music wasnt working, and was in no way pleasant. Scream is one of my least favorite coasters. Aside from RR and Apocalypse, everything else I found to be mediocre. Very dissapointing visit."
36970,My favorite is Gram probably because it's my home park lol
36971,"I would go MM, have been to MM, grAm, and SFoT is my home park. I visited mm on saturday with fright fest so only got to do half the rides, but it was a cool place. 

One of only gripes with sfot is that part of it is like a maze, i still havent figured out how to efficiently get from new texas giant to the gotham section. All the shops and what not look similar, and the signs that point to which rides are ambiguous at intersections of multiple pathways. Dont get me started about the entrance to titan, at least i can now laugh at all the people missing the lack of proper signage when you turn by el aserradero.

Although the view of the parking lot from titan is outstanding, but scream at mm is in a parking lot so it wins there /s"
36972,"Been to SFOT once, completely agree about getting lost in that area."
36973,SFMM. Best variety of rides in the country.
36974,"I've been to, technically, three parks.

Six Flags New England is my ""big"" home park. Staff is friendly, park is small enough to get around, even if the layout is a bit wonky, but big enough to have plenty to do. Also, Wicked Cyclone and Superman.

Six Flags Great Adventure is... monstrous. It's a huge park, with a HUGELY varied set of attractions. El Toro is king. The staff is pretty good, dispatch times can be hit or miss. Did I mention El Toro?

Six Flags St. Louis is weird for me. I was there for an off-season tour last year and it wasn't fully opened. Just Mr. Freeze and American Thunder. Justice League, too. Seems like it's a cool park, and would love to visit it in full swing.


Out of them, I'd probably vote SFNE... But El Toro is so damn good, it's worth the 2+ hour drive alone."
36975,"Been to: SFNE, LR, Sfgadv, SFGAm, SFOG, SFFT, SFA, Six Flags Ohio, TGE, and SFMM.  I think Six Flags Ohio was the best, it was run the best and I had the best time there. Since that park is gone, I'll go with Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It was the least Six Flags feeling park. It has personality and felt... cared for? Well aside from where Pandemonium is, that felt straight up Six Flags and kind of just placed without much thought."
36976,"Of the ones I've visited: 

1. Magic Mountain — Having TC, X2, Tatsu and FT gives it the edge, despite generally shit operations. 
2. Great Adventure — Better run than SFMM, but Nitro and El Toro cannot save a less-impressive ride profile. Not a fan of the layout.
3. Texas — Great variety of coasters and well-themed. Texas Giant is in my top 10, Titan beats SFMM's Goliath, and I could ride Runaway Mountain and La Vibora all day. 
4. Fiesta Texas — Gorgeous park. Iron Rattler also in my top 10, and despite my dislike of B&M floorless coasters, Superman is a great ride.
5. Discovery Kingdom — Well, it looks nice."
36977,"> Great Adventure — Better run than SFMM, but Nitro and El Toro cannot save a less-impressive ride profile. Not a fan of the layout.
> 

Agreed on the ""less-impressive ride profile."""
36978,"The ones i've been to...

1. SFGAdv
2. SFMM
3. SFNE

It mostly came down to the amount of rides and quality, but SFNE is slowly gaining on SFGAdv, especially with its RMC."
36979,"I'm gonna say Tatsu is the best. It's so graceful, long, and an incredible experience. Besides that, don't miss out on X2, Twisted Colossus, and Full Throttle.

As for rides you might not think would be that great but you should DEFINITELY ride, I'd say give Apocalypse, Superman: Escape From Krypton, and Viper a shot. Those rides never fail to impress me."
36980,"Thanks mate, much appreciated"
36981,"Best: Tatsu, X2, Twisted Colossus, Full Throttle  
Next Best: Batman, Apocalypse, Riddler's Revenge, Superman, Scream, Goliath   
Okay: Ninja, Viper, Revolution, Goldrusher  
Not Okay: Green Lantern"
36982,"I walked out of the park very surprised at what ended up being my two favorite coasters of the day when I went for the first time this past march. Going in to the day I was expecting to walk out with Twisted Colossus as my favorite, with maybe X2 or Tatsu right behind it. 

Instead I would actually say my favorites were:

1. Full throttle 
2. Superman: Escape from Krypton
3. Riddler’s Revenge

I got super lucky and almost every ride was a walk on all day, and the only closed ride was Green Lantern. 

My first ride of the day was X2 on the front inside left, and it was one of the best and most unique rides I’ve ever had. But later on I took another ride in the back seat (left, inside) and the final raven turn was so jerky with the rotation that I bashed my head hard against the headrest 3-4 times in a row. Overall it wasn’t a fun ride after the amazing first drop. The rotation just seems to get worse the farther back you are in the train.  If I had skipped that second ride X2 would have been my favorite and would have cracked my top 10. 

Tatsu just verified for me that I’m just not cool with B&M flyers. It’s mainly the shin restraints. I think they just trigger some kind of claustrophobia for me - which is weird cause I’m not claustrophobic at all. 

Twisted Colossus was amazing that one lap that it actually dueled. But it was jerky, short, and terribly paced during the other 7 laps. And those two laps where the station train managed to pass the 1/2 way train on the lift really hurt my head, my feelings, and my soul. 

Superman though?  I wasn’t expecting anything from the ride, and it ducking blew me away. Full Throttle I was expecting to like a lot, but it ended up being so much more fun than I had expected.  And even as a verified stand-up apologist, Riddler genuinely surprised me with how great it was. 

The rest of the coasters were pretty good for the most part. Viper really only for some GASM nostalgia; but ninja, revolution, the mine train, the big mine train (goliath burn), pretty much everything except for Scream was really very good."
36983,"I'm glad you enjoyed FT - it doesn't seem like it would be a great one on paper, but it's just a damn fun coaster!"
36984,"I used to love superman back in the day, when it went forward. I think it doesn't get enough recognition."
36985,It's still fun backwards
36986,"Glad to hear it! It's on my list of ""things I want to do again and repeatedly""."
36987,"X2, Viper, and Revolution are my personal favorites. Goliath and Tatsu are up there too. I think Tatsu is a tiny bit overhyped but maybe I just needed another ride or two on it. Riddler's Revenge was another surprising highlight. Really wasn't impressed by Twisted Colossus; obviously it's still fun but it's one of my least favorite RMCs."
36988,"Tatsu, Twisted Colossus, X2, Full Throttle, Riddler's Revenge, Revolution, Goliath, Ninja and Lex Luthor are the best rides at Magic Mountain.

I also enjoy Viper and Batman. Scream is hit or miss. Superman is worth it if the line is short."
36989,"Best - Twisted Colossus 

Worst - Green Lantern. Take a Vekoma and multiply the pain by 7"
36990,Green Lantern is actually a fun ride. Viper is painful. I would even take Green Lantern over Goliath \+ Gold Rusher.
36991,"Been going to Magic mountain a lot recently so I think I have some valuable input for you. For me the must rides at Magic Mountain are: 
Twisted Colossus - In my opinion the best ride at the park. Typically has a fast moving line since its usually running three trains.

X2 - This ride has mixed reviews but I personally think it's amazing. If you can ride back row inside seat. This thing has the best drop I've ever experienced and is just an insanely intense ride. Typically has the longest line in the park so keep that in mind. 

Full Throttle - short and sweet ride, super smooth and has some amazing hangtime on that loop. Also quite a unique ride. Can't go wrong with this one.

Tatsu - I've heard this is the best flying coaster. It's the only one I've ridden, but that Pretzel Loop is the single most intense moment I've ever experienced on a roller coaster and that alone is worth a ride. Personally I think a front row ride on this is the best. 

Lex Luthor Drop of Doom - Typically doesn't have too long of a wait and is the 2nd tallest drop tower in the world. They have VR on it right now and if you have a chance to experience it twice I'd recommend trying both. Personally for me it feels more intense with the VR but you have to try it without!

Revolution - pretty chill ride, but special to ride just for its historical significance.

Ninja - you have to do this one towards the front. I've ridden this ride a lot and the farther towards the back you get, the more tame the swinging tends to be. Front row on this thing is amazing. Surprisingly intense.

Riddler's Revenge - I tend to thing it's a little overrated but it is a fun ride that isn't super intense. From what I've heard it's one of the only bearable stand up coasters. It is pretty dang smooth, and it's the tallest and fastest stand up coaster, so probably worth a ride! 

Everything else:

Goliath - Honestly this thing is super overrated. It's fine, but it's nothing special. Offers little to no airtime, and the end offers pretty intense positive G forces, but it just isn't that enjoyable to  me.

Scream - An okay B&M, if you miss it you aren't missing much. Definitely has gotten a pretty noticeable B&M rattle over the years.

Batman - I love this ride, but it is a clone, so if you are short on time you can skip this if you've been on the other Batman clones.

Gold Rusher - a fun arrow mine train. I love old arrows so it's a must ride for me, but it isn't anything to crazy and can be skipped.

Superman Escape from Krypton - Not a super intense launch but it is a fun ride. If you sit in the front row (technically the back row since the car is backwards) you really get a sense of the speed of this thing. Your face begins to flap from the wind. If you had to choose between this and Lex Luthor I'd choose Lex.

Apocalypse: A fun GCI but it's pretty dang rough these days. Has a cool queue line though.

Green Lantern: Been closed for the past year or so and haven't seen much signs of it reopening. Super uncomfortable ride anyway.

Viper - an older arrow looper and tends to ride like one. I enjoy it but most people tend to stay away from it. As long as you lean your head forward you should be fine.

Justice League: If you've done any of the other ones you can skip this. It's slightly different but for the most part about the some. If you haven't, this thing is pretty awesome."
36992,">I've heard this is the best flying coaster

Flying Dinosaur is easily the best flying coaster in the world, but Tatsu is the best in the US."
36993,Twisted Colossus and Full Throttle are my two favorites.
36994,"When are you going?  How busy it is will determine how many rides you can get and are you getting a flash pass?  Also do you visit a lot of parks or only a few every once in a while.  There’s a few different ways to look at it, but I would try to get in all of their good/unique rides, regardless of other people’s opinions l, because we all vary.  I would put them in tiers and pick from there moving down.  

So tier 1 of there most widely regarded and unique rides would be:
X2
Twisted Colossus
Tatsu
Full Throttle

Tier 2 is your good woodies, average B&Ms, something that would be a main attraction in the 90s:
Superman
Scream
Riddler
Apocalypse
Batman
Goliath

Tier 3 would be your older Arrow rides and smaller more tame rides, that have some fans and have some historical significance, but would be below average rides to most: 
Ninja
Revolution
Green Lantern
Viper
Gold Rusher

Unless you have a specific reason to hit any of the tier 3, like maybe wanna do Viper bc you haven’t done a late 80s arrow mega looper than you should most likely be able to get the tier 1 and 2 rides.  If you have to eliminate some Batman is cloned so if you have ridden a clone or will soon be able to skip that.  If you have ridden a bigger B&M standup (Mantis, Chang) and didn’t enjoy skip Ridler, if not you may want the experience.  All of the floorless are fairly similar so skip scream if you’ve done things like Medusa/dominator/bizzaro and thought meh.  Point being here it’s all about the B&Ms if your a big fan of their average rides hit these up, if not or you’ve ridden plenty of others go for the more unique ones like Superman, Goliath, etc."
36995,"I’ve been on all the non-kiddie coasters except Apocalypse (though I haven’t done Revolution since pre-makeover, and the ones I have done were spread out over 3 visits from 2010 to 2017). Here’s my ranking...I think:

*Tier 1: Awesome*

T1. Twisted Colossus

T1. X2

3. Tatsu

4. Full Throttle

5. Superman

*Tier 2: Solid*

6. Batman

7. Goliath

8. Scream

*Tier 3: OK*

9. Ninja (would like to ride it again though)

10. Revolution (probably better post-refurb)

*Tier 4: Wouldn’t Recommend*

11. Riddler’s Revenge (probably would’ve rated it higher if I hadn’t been worried the whole ride as my seat kept popping up notches...)

12. Viper (ouch...would like to try again though)

13. Goldrusher (just odd, not comfortable as a single rider)

14. Green Lantern (lots of forward/backward body tossing...it’s like a mild car accident)"
36996,"Twisted Colossus is the best

After that, Tatsu, X2, and Full Throttle are all must rides.  They also have a lot of really good coasters outside of those, and I know a lot of people hate Green Lantern, but I thought it was a pretty awesome ride."
36997,"I have a tough time ranking X2, Full Throttle, and Tatsu.  All three are awesome in different ways.   Twisted Colossus is on another level, however."
36998,"I just went friday, I agree on most things minus riddler. I would probably bump full throttle to #2 because its smooth and reridable. Not really sure where riddler ranks but its high for me,  I love standups. Getting the restraints right is all the difference.

Twisted is in competition for my top #1. After only doing NTG, twisted is insane with the off axis twists, double downs, and inversions, where NTG is only small straight ejector hills. Not to mention I got to race or get close to racing 4/6 loops around."
36999,"Yeah, my feet are really prone to getting sore anyways, so having any form of G's in a stand-up is just hell for me.
As for TC, can we all just agree that it's insane?"
37000,">Ninja:
>This ride exists. 

LMFAO"
37001,"Honestly, I prefer Tatsu to Twisted Colossus. It's much more comfortable, longer, more diversified, crazy, fun, and the atmosphere kicks ass. Mostly it's just so damn fuuuuun.

I love X2, but it sure beat the shit out of me last time I rode it. I rode outside the first two times, but the last time I rode inside, 5th row. And I felt like I was dying the whole time. It was truly just as rough as the fabled legends told. But on the outside I found it to be absolutely incredible."
37002,Goliath too high. GL:FF and Tatsu too low.
37003,Lol I didn't even ride GL:FF
37004,"Enjoyed the report. Small nitpick, Joker nee Roar (West) is at SFDK not CGA."
37005,"Solid report. I went last Monday and actually enjoyed the park for the most part. The staff was great and the park was very clean. None of the rides are stand out for me, but Superman is solid but definitely not running like new, haha. I really liked it in the front row compared to back. Wild One, Jokers Jinx and Batwing I thought were fun. The park needs a big homerun ride like an RMC for sure."
37006,"Haven’t ridden Batwing, but have ridden Nighthawk at Carowinds and I agree 100%. These Vekoma flyers are nothing extraordinary, but man are they fun, the loop especially."
37007,"Do not RMC Roar.....  tied for the best at the park.

Other than that I am glad you had a good experience.  SFA is overly hated and it doesn't deserve it.  In all honesty I feel SFA has the edge over KD anymore/"
37008,"SFA is better than a park with a Giga, RMC, and a solid floor less coaster? Right...."
37009,"Yeah hard agree on that... my takeaway is that SFA is decent for what it is and doesnt deserve all the ire it gets, but I'd go to KD for Dominator and TT anyday. KD has much nicer landscaping and scenery too."
37010,Dominator is the better floorless but it still doesn't do much for me.  And I am not negating the fact that KD has a great thing with i305 and Twisted Timbers but after that KD kind of goes meh.... I really like Grizzly but would rather ride Roar....  SFA has a more consistent line up of rides that are decent across the board.
37011,KD has the better ride lineup but SFA has superior woodies
37012,"Jokers Jinx, Batwing, Superman.... all great steel coasters.  I'm not saying KD is terrible because it's not.... I'm just saying with everything that KD has lost it's not the hands-down winner anymore.  Even when it comes to flats the new pendulum at SFA is going to really challenge KD."
37013,"I agree that SFA gets more hate than it should, but putting it on the same level as KD is silly. I don’t understand thoosies who claim KD has lost a lot and is trending downhill. Name one other defunct ride from the past decade that is missed besides Volcano."
37014,I even enjoyed Shockwave and I think Delirium is an upgrade.
37015,"Why do you like Roar so much? Serious question, not sarcastic. The layout seems good it just seems like it needs a retrack at a minimum."
37016,I don't find it rough at all.  I love that it's constantly turning and has no straight track on it... it just feels completely out of control and amazing.
37017,It's really not rough in the front I've found
37018,"My headache post ride would like to kindly disagree with you. I'll believe you more if you say it's enjoyable despite the roughness, but not rough at all?"
37019,That's correct. It isn't rough at all in the front
37020,"Man, I love it too. I mean if you don't like wooden coasters there's no way you're going to like it, of course, but if you do love wooden coasters, Roar is excellent. Super fun and out of control feeling. RMC'ing it would be a kick in the stomach. Enough with the conversions to steel."
37021,Well I went ahead and got a gold membership on the assumption I'd go back or go to GAdv in the next year so I'll be sure to give it another go and keep those things in mind. I want to like woodies more but I guess my taste just leans more GP than hardcote enthusiast. I wish I could get on a modern woodie like Mystic Timbers to see what all the hype is about. I feel I've only ridden really old woodies like Roar or Grizzly or Hurler before the redo.
37022,"Superman is about 1000x better in the front than the back in my opinion. This sounds crazy to most, but I rank it as my number 5 coaster for the insane intensity and ejector airtime. (I have 77 credits)"
37023,"That explains why I actually really liked jokers jinx this year. With the mid course break run limited or off, the second half is actually enjoyable.

As for superman, I wouldn't say it was brand new, but it was much more improved on from the last couple years. I think the only rough patch was there at the end before the bunny hills.

Roar gets worse each year, and I've decided I'm not riding it again until they do something to it."
37024,"I agree with you that theming rides is important.  I have never been to SFMM, and the only real ""theme park"" I've been to is Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, but it most definitely makes a difference.  Most mainstream U.S. parks are sorely lacking on the ""theme"" aspect (your Six Flags and your Cedar Fairs).

One of the first things I learned in ride construction - specifically from John Wardley - was all about the importance of the scenery.  I hope to make it to Alton Towers one day, and I also wish more American parks put an emphasis on their theming."
37025,"Cedar Fair is better then Six Flags. Kings island has a bit of theme, and there are some coasters filled with trees (Beast and diamondback). Both of the Busch Gardens are the best theme parks in the US. Of course, Disney and Universal are amazing, too."
37026,"Cedar Point is literally the worst example for theming. Their ""theming"" is pretty much just the lake setting. None of the rides have themes except maybe for Maverick, but they have done a terrible job keeping the theme up and now it's basically nonexistent. I love CP but that's ridiculous to say they have good theming compared to a place like BGW."
37027,"I don't think Cedar Point really has to use theming. It is just an amusment park. I think what they do right now it perfect: Using the land and great landscaping to make the rides look their best. When I went to Six Flags I hated their theming. It looked tacking, cheap, and ugly. Also, the look of a bunch of differently themed rides next to each other isn't that great. Theme parks should be the only parks that theme their rides. Amusement parks shouldn't have to. Theme parks do it much better because they are able to theme entire parks of the park to make everything match and look its best. I like the direction that the Cedar Fair parks are going, but I guess everyone has a different opinion."
37028,">I don't think Cedar Point really has to use theming. It is just an amusment park. 

I never said CP needs to do theming, I said it's one of the worst parks that you could use as an example of good theming, because it doesn't have any."
37029,"No, what I meant is the trees and the beautification. Cedar Point has no themeing I agree."
37030,"Europe does not seem to push the envelope with roller coasters the way the US does, but boy do you guys have a higher standard for parks than us. I was having this conversation with someone at work the other day (not sure how this came up) and told them I didn't think a Six Flags park would be very successful in Europe. Europapark and Alton Towers are probably the two nicest parks I've ever been to. They just blew me away. That level of dedication to quality is rare over here. 

As someone who has a Six Flags as my nearest park (Great Adventure), I almost visit begrudgingly. I go because they have one of the best rides I've ever been on (El Toro), but almost always have some level of regret at going while I'm there. There are few redeeming factors about the overall experience outside of the few top notch rides they have. 

Busch Gardens Williamsburg is a park that maintains a European level quality standard. I was a season pass holder when I lived in North Carolina and I never got bored of going to that place. It's just a pleasant place to be in outside of the ride experience."
37031,How long ago did you go to Alton towers?
37032,[Last September](http://jonathanhawkins.net/2012/09/alton-towers/).
37033,"The water on nemesis is still dyed red, you were just in the off season, and it was a real shame that the 2005 plans fell through, as Alton towers alternate between family rides and rollercoasters yearly I suppose there is hope for 2015. The smiler (SW7) is my favorite ride there, it's got that same short looping bursts that nemesis has with less G forces and is very intertwined with itself, making all of the loops and bends flow incredibly well.
Edit: [Video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UrqbWF9fJ8&feature=youtube_gdata_player) very little pov footage but a good idea of the track based clusterfuck."
37034,"Welcome to the US!  I just recently returned from a trip to Germany and was blown away at how nice most of the parks are in your area.  Europa may be the best theme park on the planet while Phantasialand, Efteling, and Tripsdrill are all world class.

Unfortunately, a majority of the large regional parks in the US are average to poor when it comes to atmosphere, theme, and attention to detail.  The only place that can compare to Europa or Phantasialand is Disneyland which you should definitely visit while you're in California. 

I don't know where else in the US you are planning to visit but Busch Gardens, Hersheypark, Silver Dollar City, Dollywood, and the Universal parks are just a notch below but still pretty good.  Cedar Fair and Six Flags parks have some good rides but don't expect a lot of atmosphere to go with it.  On the other hand, we have a ton of small parks, family parks, and boardwalks that are charming in their own way."
37035,"Thanks for the advice! Unfortunately, we have a very tight schedule because we only have two weeks and want to drive to SF, Yosemite (if it hasn't burn down until next week... ) and LV. We ruled out the Universal Studios because we all are not that into movies and we think Disney land is too expensive and we'd rather see some more of LA while we are here. 


Oh and I'm glad you liked Germany :-)"
37036,Did you ride Apocalypse? It's soooo much better than Colossus (colossus is only good when seated at the front of the train) and I'm really disappointed you didn't get to on X2 -that ride and Tatsu are arguably the two best coasters ever made.
37037,Great to hear that I not only missed the great X2 but also another great ride because both were closed. Thanks for rubbing salt into it :-P
37038,Doubt it. Apocalypse has been closed. Saw they were doing some track work/inspections.
37039,Since when??
37040,"Been almost a week I believe.

37041,"Welcome to our country! Hope you like Cali, but i have a bone to pick with you. Scream, Riddlers Revenge and Batman almost suck the big one? Seriously? Those rides are fantastic, if a little rocky and relatively ""old"". I do agree with you on the theming though (Scream especially). But they definitely went for thrill over theme, and in most cases it doesn't bother me because frankly the thrill of the ride outweighs any lack of theme or scenery."
37042,Scream used to be great but is aging badly. RR however is still as epic as ever!
37043,"Just constant heat from both above, and below will do that to steel that just sits like that."
37044,"Yeah I definitely agree with you that Scream is a fantastic ride. Very nice elements and a lot of action. But it has seen better times and the dozen punches to the head are a unforgivable deal breaker for me. Same goes for Riddler. Batman however was tolerable, I have to admit that. I very much appreciate that modern coasters tend to get away from over head restraints and try to give the rider a free experience around his head.


Thrill is in fact something we see seldomly in Europe. But as I said, I'd now say that I prefer themeing over thrill."
37045,"Some of the newer coasters do not have landscape features, which I've come to notice (Scream, X2, Tatsu to an extent). Older rides (Gold Rusher, Revolution, Ninja) seem to be built around the landscape. I guess over time SFMM decided to go more for thrill than aesthetics, which I'm perfectly fine with since the newer coasters are pretty amazing. (As rickety as Revolution is, I do appreciate it's designed around landscape). 

As for Viper, it's only fun if you're taller than the headrests, otherwise you're going to have a bad time."
37046,I used to hate viper but I enjoy it now.. Maybe it is just because I am taller :P ... Tatsu uses the landscape well.
37047,"The restrains on Viper dig into my shoulders a bit too much, so I would say that being too tall also has its disadvantages."
37048,"I'm rather small (173cm, convert yourself :-P) and yet I have a nice bruise on my shoulder. Not great for a day at the beach :-("
37049,"I'm too tall for Viper, it's painful."
37051,"Yeah, the fact that the rides at SFMM are mostly over concrete does bother me- particularly Scream. It really does take away from how solid the ride could be!"
37052,At least they finally painted over the parking stripes...
37053,"OP, what about Lex Luthor???"
37054,Lex Luthor? Did I miss something? O.o
37055,"Well its not a coaster, but currently the worlds tallest and fastest drop ride"
37056,"Ah, yeah that one. I don't like those rides but I got a good look while I waited for my friend to ride it ;-)"
37057,I understand where you're coming from. I'm from New York and I've been waiting to ride X since it first opened 11 years ago or whatever. We finally made it to six flags magic mountain and it was closed all day. Biggest disappointment of my life thus far.
37058,I wouldn't go that far but I mourned pretty much all morning and again in the afternoon when we passed it.
37059,"hey, 11 years is pretty fucking long for a 19 year old. I was devastated."
37060,"Alton towers local here, wondering how well themed parks in the US are, any examples/averages?"
37061,"I have noticed that a few Six Flags parks do not do much in turns of landscaping. That is another thing Cedar Fair (and other parks like Bush Gardens) has. They design their rides to not only be fun to ride, but to also look nice. I noticed that at all the Cedar Fair parks I have been to almost all of the thrill rides and roller coasters were placed to fit in with the landscape. The roller coasters had grass, rocks, etc. under them and were not just placed over concrete."
37062,"BG>CF>SF with respect to landscaping.

Cheetah Hunt at BGT probably has the best scenery and landscaping value of all the ~100 roller coasters I have ever been on. Big Bad Wolf at BGW was thrilling due to the trees, especially in the autumn. Scream however..."
37063,"Putting grass under a coaster instead of concrete is still not themeing it. Have a look at Black Mamba (Phantasialand) or Blue Fire (Europapark). That is themeing! The coaster diving into dips and through caves, winding through the African desert like a snake or flashing through the scarce and rocky landscape of Iceland."
37064,"Well they do more than just drop it on a piece of grass. I didn't really know how to explain it. I was just trying to point out that other parks actually theme/landscape their rides instead of putting it on concrete like SF. Most Cedar Fair coasters are not really themed but have beautiful landscaping and placement in the park. Only a very few do have themeing in CF and I will admit that. Some of them do have slight themeing like Maverick at CP. Some of coasters that I have seen really themed are too short or not that fun because they spent so much to theme it or it is too distracting. Also, It just depends on what you think themeing is. Some people might say Maverick is themed, some may not. Same with the Smiler. Some people might want more themeing. Some people might not even liked themed coasters. It just depends on what you like and what parks you go to. I know it takes a lot to theme a ride, but different people may say different things and hate some themeing while liking others. Also, a lot of ""themed"" rides are not that themed.
Also, a lot of the coasters at CO and other CF parks are so fun and look so nice that they don't need to be themed.

Sorry for all the text. I am on mobile and have no idea how big this will be. I will have to shorten it later."
37065,I just went to Hersheypark and it's one of the best parks I've been to. I went to SFGAdv a few days prior and it pales in comparison.
37066,"If you're willing to go 6 and a half hours away, the easy answer is Cedar Point.

King's Dominion is a solid choice also from what I hear."
37067,"Kings Dominion is the obvious answer if you've never been - it's a shorter drive than Busch Gardens and one of the best parks in the Cedar Fair chain.

Pennsylvania parks like Hershey and Knoebels are also great answers. Knoebels in particular is a really unique family owned park that gets [tons of praise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/6siqq8/dorney_knoebels_trip_report_august_5_2017/?st=jhtbue18&sh=95090906) in this sub."
37068,"Echoing Cedar Point, but also I vote Busch Gardens."
37069,"So, these rankings aren't purely done on park quality, but also on distance. I would read each description thoroughly. 

1) Busch Gardens Williamsburg: Fantastic coaster collection, great food/drinks, catchy music, great entertainment, and looks beautiful. You are transported into a new European country with each section. Overall an amazing atmosphere and one of the top parks in America. Plus, there's a lot to do in Williamsburg.

2) Hersheypark: Is it a bit further but is a really charming park with a top notch collection of 13 coasters, including some world class ones like Skyrush and Storm Runner. It's also pretty in most areas too, and you have a zoo and Hershey's Chocolate World right on site. You're getting the full package with it.

3) Kings Dominion: Has about as good of a coaster lineup as Hershey. I305 and Twisted Timbers are two of the most insane coaster experiences you're going to get. Besides the coasters, it has a really good flat ride collection and is shaded in most areas, but doesn't have much for non-thrill seekers. Still, it's a great place to spend a day and is right off of I-95.

4) Cedar Point: This park is only this low if driving six hours from DC is a hassle. Otherwise, Cedar Point is the best amusement park in the country (emphasis on ""amusement"" and not ""theme"": it's an extremely thrill-oriented park). It has the best coaster lineup in my opinion, with 17 roller coasters. The best and most insane ones are Maverick, Top Thrill Dragster, Millennium Force, and the recently-opened Steel Vengeance. You still have many more that would make most parks' top 5s. Besides the coasters, there is a plethora of thrilling flat rides, and other activities in area such as the nearby beach. You will also get great views on some of the rides. 

5) Knoebels: This is a more laid back, family-style park, but it's still fantastic. There are only a handful of good roller coasters but this park is incredibly quirky, shaded, and there are a LOT of activities to do there outside of them. Food is some of the best at any park, too. Something to note- admission is free, but you pay per-ride. Is slightly farther than Hershey.

6) Dollywood: Think of it as Busch Gardens quality but themed to the south. It's ranked this low because it's also several hours away, but it is a must visit. Fantastic theming, food, coasters (Lightning Rod holy shit) and music are rolled into one.

7) Six Flags Great Adventure: This park has El Toro, one of the greatest coasters ever built. It is a must ride for any coaster fan. It also has the tallest and second fastest roller coaster in the world, Kingda Ka. It also has Nitro, a very fun B&M hyper. Besides that? This park isn't that good. The rest of the coasters range from alright to pretty bad (and are mostly clones), but the big turnoff is how unimpressive it is to be in. It's dirty, not well shaded, is plastered in advertisements, and has mediocre food. If you want to do El Toro and Kingda Ka that badly it's worth it to visit once, but if you want a full park experience, you won't find it here.

8) Other PA parks: These include Kennywood, Dorney Park, and Waldameer. They have one standout roller coaster each (although Phantom's Revenge is considered to be amazing) but none are on El Toro's level and none of the three offer anything special either to travel a few hours to.

9) Six Flags America: Bad park overall. Sort of unpleasant to be in and has a mediocre coaster lineup. It is however the closest to you, but it's much more worth it to drive more to a better park."
37070,"Hersheypark, Knoebels, and Kings Dominion are all great. I still think Busch Gardens is the best choice though. There isn’t a bad ride, the park is clean, it’s completely beautiful, and it’s one of the best park experiences around. It’s honestly my third favorite park, only behind Cedar Point and Dollywood. There literally isn’t a bad thing about the park I can think of. Plus the food is amazing and not TOO expensive. Great Adventure is honestly probably the worst option."
37071,"Can concur, if you have done Gadv already and there is nothing new, it's not worth the ride. So much better coasters being built everywhere else. Gadv needs a RMC bad :("
37072,"Europa-Park hands down. The level of details and passion that goes into this park is insane. 

It's also been voted best park in the world for the last 4 years by Golden Ticket."
37073,"Knoebel's

EDIT: I should elaborate....  Knoebel's is an amazing park with an experience that you will not get anywhere else.  There are also 2 world class wooden coasters that aren't to be missed *(my non-enthusiast sisters were having a discussion about coasters and the one said that wooden just weren't her thing even though she'll ride them and the other one who had been to knoebel's told her that she would absolutely change her mind after riding those two)* as well as the flying turns which is a neat experience and a fun little steel coaster.  This is also a park that you could stop and spend a few hours at or spend a whole day at and enjoy yourself either way.

My personal opinion on Busch Gardens isn't horrible but when I went a few years ago solely as a coaster/ride enthusiast I really wasn't impressed.  I've found it to be the most expensive in terms of admission, food, merchandise and didn't rise to my expectations.  There isn't a bad ride there and it is a beautiful park but for someone who is/was focused on rides I felt like I was paying for a lot of stuff that I could have easily done without.  There are 2 new coasters since I've been there so maybe that helps and, aside from that, I also want to stress that this isn't saying it's a horrible park because it isn't but it doesn't rate high on my list simply because of what I'm looking for.  I'm far happier stopping at King's Dominion, paying less, and getting a lot more rides."
37075,"I echo the Cedar Point vote is you are up for a road trip.

If not, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is the way to go.  They have a really good collection of roller coasters and the park itself is one of the most beautiful parks in the country.

Hersheypark would be a close second for me.  They have a lot deeper collection of roller coasters but to me, they lack the top end quality that BGW has.  They have the quantity though.  They have 7 really good coasters.   It is also a really nice park, but not on the level of BGW.  Throw in the zoo that is attached, and Hersheypark is one of the few parks I could do more than a day at without getting bored."
37076,"If you do BGW you could add Kings Dominion to your trip easily.

Also Dollywood is in your area and is a wonderful park."
37077,Couple hours from DC?  Hershey or Kings Dominion would be the best.  I prefer Hershey but I haven't been to KD in a while.
37078,One that I haven't seen mentioned is if you want to combine rides and beach you could check out Morey's Pier in Wildwood NJ. A trio of neighboring piers built off the boardwalk with a handful of coasters including a nice super old school wooden one that goes out over the beach. Plus some good water park sections and you're at the damn beach! A longer drive than say Ocean City but about the same as VA Beach so worth thinking of.
37079,"If neither of you have visited Kings Dominion or Hersheypark, I highly recommend them. I live near DC, too, and I can't choose between KD, HP, and BGW as my favorite ""local"" park. No matter which one you visit, you're going to get amazing coasters, smooth operations, and a nice atmosphere. I think BGW has the best of all three categories, but the other three aren't bad at all. BGW has the most consistently good lineup, KD has the best ""standout"" coasters, and HP has the best variety. Operations clearly vary per visit, and while I can't recall HP or KD having slow ops, BGW has always memorably impressed me with its efficiency. Finally, BGW is a true theme park that has the most beautiful and immersive atmosphere. KD and HP both have parts that are kind of ugly in my opinion, but they also have some totally gorgeous areas as well. 

I've never been to Six Flags in New Jersey, but I've heard some not-so-nice things about it that can be read in this thread. Cedar Point is literally the greatest place on earth, but that's not a day trip for us down here (and you might need two days to cover everything there anyway!) But for a day trip from DC, you can't go wrong with Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, or Hersheypark."
37080,I don't see why you can't go to both at some point. You live close enough that you're not too far from either.
37081,Cedar Point or Magic Mountain. Both just a couple hours by car or plane.
37082,"You can fly from the east coast to lax, then drive to santa clarita in a couple hours? Seems legit"
37083,If you're fast enough you can probably finish both parks in one day.
37084,Actually yeah. It’s about a 4.5 hour flight followed by a 1 hour drive. Expect 6-7 hours total. Not bad at all.
37085,"Plus you have to get to the airport at least an hour, probably 2 hours, before the plane takes off so there’s that"
37086,Which passes do you have?
37087,In that area? Easily King's Dominion or Busch Gardens Williamsburg. Busch Gardens is a great park but King's Dominion has better coasters.
37088,"Kings Dominion for amazing coasters and good atmosphere. Busch Gardens Williamsburg for amazing atmosphere and good coasters.
I wouldn't recommend anything else. Except maybe Hersheypark."
37089,"Here's the top 25 parks when sorted by median rated coaster

The point assignments of ""500 - #rank"" are less valuable than the underlying values used to calculate the original rankings, though."
37090,"I just updated the top 25 parks with all the unlisted coasters and total coaster counts. All unlisted coasters are worth zero points (think kiddie coasters, garbage coasters, Vekoma SLCs and Boomerangs). I also did the work for you and averaged every coaster, including the crap ones. (Sub-500 coasters are all in ""500th place"")

These deeeeefinitely factor when determining a median. Check out Six Flags New England and Carowinds for a hell of an example."
37091,Damn good for KK
37092,Sorry if the list sort was confusing - more points is better. KK is #25
37093,Oh lmao whoops
37094,"Good for CGA, holy crap."
37095,A list that shows Shock Wave at SFOT is better than Titan is a validated list to me!
37096,I don't get how clones like Tigris and Tempesto have such radically different rankings.
37097,Scenery and maintenance can play a huge part in the experience.  For one example that involves both I think FoF at KD is garbage and the one at KI is amazing.  The pre-show theme adds to the experience and when I get off the KD one I tend to have a headache while the KI one I don't seem to have the same issue (even though they both actually seem like similar ride experiences)
37098,"Nice work! As someone else said, it would be interesting to see these ranked by quality over quantity. Perhaps find the average score by dividing each score by the total number of roller coasters in the park? Or in the park that got a rank?"
37099,"I think a simple way to interpret quality over quantity is simply to look at the rankings of each individual coaster in the park and, well, that's it."
37100,Odd to see Wonder Woman vs Railblazer not be right next to each other... is one running better than the other or is it a matter of ridership?
37101,It's more of a matter of this still being an imperfect science. It'll improve each year as more people vote on it.
37102,"Maybe setting/park is an influence, it's mostly hard core enthusiasts who have been on both. Just based on trip reports I'd say WWGLC is actually running better than Railblazer, it doesn't have the three potholes on the hill to the brake run."
37103,Never realized how good SF Great America’s lineup really is. Might just be because it’s my home park
37104,Me neither. It was my biggest surprise when compiling this list. I expected it to be six or seven spots lower.
37105,Ok so I was looking back at the coaster rankings and HOLY SHIT lost coaster is actually ranked higher than steel Hawg wtf
37106,"Might be its uniqueness. Enthusiasts will appreciate a REALLY quirky and unique coaster more when they've already ridden one of the other five El Locos, perhaps?"
37107,Could be. I’ve always liked LoCoSuMo more so no complaints from me
37108,AKA a listing of the parks with the most coasters.
37109,"If you look at it more closely, you'll see that it's definitely about more than that. Parks with loads of B-coasters don't do nearly as well. Lots of those coasters might not even make it into the top 500 at all, hence they won't matter in the numbers game."
37110,"I just updated my original post showing all the below-500 coasters that are in each park. As a counterpoint to your argument, please take a look at Six Flags New England, Carowinds, Lagoon, and Morey's Piers on my list. The number of crap coasters in those parks is huge!"
37111,"My comment was mostly tounge in cheek, because obviously the more coasters you have, the more likely they will be ""ranked,"" the more likely you'll place high in these rankings.

I take umbridge with calling unranked coasters ""crap"" though. Wild Mice and kiddies aren't crap, they have their place, but of course you don't plan trips around them (unless you're me and my wife are least.).   I also love Mine Trains and Arrow Loopers, so maybe the rankers have shitty taste 😝.

But mostly I just heavily disagree with the rankings of the poll. I didn't vote so I can't complain, but wooden coasters aren't getting a fair shake by integrating them with the steels. RMCs are wayyy too inflated, and rides like Magnum are comically low. Same things I always complain about..."
37112,"I agree with you on Magnum, but the ranking seems to reflect the average person's opinion about it in this subreddit, though.

I didn't mean to seem disparaging to coasters that didn't make it in the top 500. I used that word as a simple way to make the context of what I'm doing more digestible to the average reader."
37113,"Magnum is a 31 year old Arrow in a park with a huge number of winners. Honestly, I am ecstatic to see it so high up still.

RMCs and other newer coasters are more universally acclaimed, while older coasters like Magnum have their fanbases but naturally lose some sheen with newer enthusiasts. It's predictable, and it makes sense to me to see things laid out this way.

Lovely poll. Thanks for sharing it!"
37114,"I enjoyed this, until Buffalo Bill's was ranked above Morey's Piers."
37115,"Gotta blame the people who voted more highly for Buffalo Bill's single coaster than they did for Morey's Piers' seven coasters combined! None of its coasters cracked the top 500.

(that's kinda wild and depressing, huh)"
37116,My guess would be more people have gone out of their way to ride Desperado.
37117,"By the way, I added more info to give context to the ratings.

Check it out, Morey's Piers has one coaster in the top 500, but SIX that are not. Hence, only one ranked coaster, which essentially means it's Great White vs. Desperado."
37118,"This poll definitely has the right direction given it reflects the Mitch poll's system. It also seems to do a good job of getting a mix of the US and worldwide coasters. However, I can tell that at least so far, it's suffering from a big lack of support for the smaller parks. 

I've seen several examples of high tier rides that have ranked severely below the supporting lineup coasters from the high visited parks. While I'm sure more ballots and support over time will correct this, there should be some weighting to ensure that Cedar Point and Kings Island's coasters don't dominate over everything. I've read a little into Coaster Bot's methodology and he clearly lies out the challenges faced with this. It's been a while, but IIRC, the Mitch Poll did compensate in some way for lower ridden rides.

I don't want to seem to critical, since Coaster Bot works hard at what he does, and is one of the better coaster content creators around. While the statistics are always interesting, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on this year's results until we see if next year's seem to be more accurately reflected."
37119,"Plenty of rankings I find baffling (less than 10% of the top 100 includes wooden coasters which is a crime, as is Batman being around 200 simply because it's been cloned).

Still interesting to see though. Now let's do a ""quality over quantity"" where parks with at least 3 coasters are ranked based on the average spot each coaster landed. I have a feeling BGT, BGW, SWO, Holiday World, SDC, and a few of the smaller parks will receive a lot more love on a list like that."
37120,Is it that baffling considering less than 10% of the roller coasters currently operating are made from wood? Wooden coasters make up only 2.9% of the roller coasters in Europe and 13% in the US. 10% sounds pretty good to me!
37121,"Quality vs. Quantity

Mystic Timbers, Voyage, Ghostrider, El Toro, Lightning Rod, Outlaw Run, Boulder Dash (on a good day), Python in Bamboo Forest, Fireball, Wodan, and Raving Flyer 2 are all in my top 25. Furthermore, I'd put Colossos, Phoenix, Gold Striker, Prowler,  Boardwalk Bullet, Thunderhead, Rampage, Balder, Raven, and American Thunder somewhere within my top 75. I haven't been on them but I'm guessing T-Express, Wildfire, Wood Coaster (Knight), El Toro (Germany), and several of the Chinese woodies there too.

Now of course, that means my top 75-ish is still only filled with 30% wooden coasters, but I still find it surprising that rides like Wodan, Mystic, and Ghostrider are ranked as low as they are and that continues down the list. I guess I just happen to prefer a solid wooden coaster over most people who participated in the poll.

Then again people put Kumba at 90 so the poll is complete nonsense anyway. ;)"
37122,"This is it right, it's entirely subjective. I think most people prefer steel roller coasters over wooden ones. Personally I'm right with you, I absolutely love a solid wooden roller coaster. Hopefully next year we'll have more people taking part who have ridden the awesome wooden coasters in China so they get more accurate rankings. Once that happens I'm sure we'll see more wooden coasters in the top 100. :)"
37123,"So if you think the voters underrate wooden coasters, I'll ask this, Raven or Thunderbird?  Which is better?"
37124,Thunderbird's my favorite wing coaster but unless Raven is running like crap I'll go Raven every day of the week.
37125,"For this to work, I'd suggest averaging only the top 3 or top 4 of each park. Take Canada's Wonderland, for example. 17 coasters, but only a couple that stand out. But then you have Holiday World with five coasters and The Voyage."
37126,One way we could consider it is doing a top three or a top five and averaging those.
37127,"Exactly that, yeah"
37128,CGA BEATS DISNEYLAND LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
37129,"Thank you for doing all of this! It's definitely an interesting way to use the numbers from the Coasterbot poll. Though, shout-out to me living near a home park that has six coasters and ZERO ranked 😂😂 Probably the largest park that has nothing ranked in all of the US"
37130,Every coaster within a 200 mile radius of where I live doesn't make it into the top 500! :(
37131,That sucks too :( Guess we'll both be making journeys to great parks next year!
37132,"Magic Mountain is better than Cedar Point.

I said what I said."
37133,I think we'll all agree that both parks are mandatory to visit on relatively equal footing.
37134,"As a teenager I preferred Magic Mountain to Cedar Point but I considered them nearly even. throughout the 2000s and 2010s Cedar Point has completely separated itself from Magic Mountain in pretty much every metric that I care about- general coaster collection, top tier coasters operations, upkeep, atmosphere."
37135,"I think in terms of great coasters, they seem pretty evenly matched - though there were 4 or 5 closed coasters when I visited CP. The ones I did get to ride were great, but ops were terrible and lines were stupid long. Perhaps I need a few more visits to CP to see what everyone else sees, but I didn't enjoy my trip very much."
37136,I would agree that Cedar Point's operations are not what they're cracked up to be but they are usually running the correct number of trains unlike Magic Mountain who can barely manage to keep one operational train operational. And in terms of a direct comparison between coaster Cedar Point wins almost all of them and it's not close.
37137,"Having great coasters is great, if you can ride them.

Long lines and closed coasters prevented me from doing that, even over two days at CP. Gemini, TTD, Rougarou, Blue Streak, and Wicked Twister were all closed. Millennium Force, Maverick, and Steel Vengeance were hour to 2 hour waits even on a ticket system. 

I'm not saying it's not a good park, or that I won't give it another shot. I'm saying if I had the option of going to one park over the other, I'm going to the park where I can actually ride things."
37138,"Oh I completely agree. Last time we were at Cedar Point, we played ""guess which coasters are currently down despite perfect weather"". It was a really fun way to pass the time, because at all hours of the day(s) we visited, we'd find ourselves in line for a ride and we had a blast just going down the list and trying to guess which coasters were down.

The funnest part was each morning, when we would round the park and queue for Millennium Force (told it was opening late), then run to Maverick and be told they didn't know when it would open, only to go to Vengeance and be told it may not open at all that day, then to give up and go to Gemini and see a chain across the front without them even staffing an attendant to explain it wasn't open. Same with Mine Ride which was at least cycling empties. Finally we found Magnum open with no wait, rode it, then made our way over to Dragster which still hadn't opened.

We did this exact crawl through the park in some form each day and almost always found more coasters closed than open in the back half of the park well after the posted open time.

Cedar Point is a damn joke when it comes to ride up time. I've never seen a park with so many problems keeping rides up for a few hours at a time or even bothering to open on time. And I really, really don't want to hear about ""weather"" or ""safety"". Every other park has this stuff figured out.

Now in terms of SFMM being any better? That's not even a debate. CP is still better in their attempt to open things. SFMM just throws up a sign and calls it a day. It's always a major gamble to see just which SFMM coasters will bother to attempt to open. Back in the mid 2000's I have pictures of the ""closed today"" signs outside the park overflowing and unable to hold all of the plaques for the amount of rides down. On any given day, at least 3 or 4 headliners were closed with half a dozen more smaller rides and it was like that in the middle of the summer. I can't remember them all, but my friends and I considered it a badge of honor when all 4 B&M's, Superman, Ninja, Deja Vu, and of course X were all down for the day during Fright Fest in 2005 I believe."
37139,"We've had very different experiences at SFMM. I've only been there 3 or 4 times, for a couple days each time, but aside from Apocalypse being down while they built West coast racers, I can't think of any rides being down on my trips."
37140,"Eh depends on the time of the year and day you go. Obviously rides like the dragster will pretty much always have long lines but if you go during down season and late at night its so much improved.  For instance on less busy days I can typically get on the millenium force in 45 minutes, raptor in 25-30 and wicked twister, power tower, gemini, max air, and magnum xl somewhere around 15. Ones like corkscrew, blue streak or matterhorn are obviously short. On the other hand rides like the dragster and maverick are always long (also weirdly some like iron dragon), and during halloweekends its so bad. Just depends on when you go"
37141,"Cedar Point probably has the best combination of quality and quantity of coasters in the world, followed by Magic Mountain (depending on who you ask). Fuji-Q has some coasters that are arguably better than at those two, but doesn't have anywhere near the same volume."
37142,Magic mountain or cedar point.  Both are phenomenal
37143,"If you actually want to visit a theme park then your best bet would of course be Orlando and visit Islands of adventure, SeaWorld Orlando & Busch Gardens. If you’re talking amusement parks then it’d be Cedar Point & Magic mountain"
37144,"Yeah I wrongly used theme park , but I mean amusement park"
37145,I consistently think Cedar Point.
37146,Cedar point is the obvious choice. A very well rounded lineup of great coasters and something for all types of enthusiasts.
37147,Michigan's Adventure
37148,"Hey, I know that was supposed to be mean. Don't be mean."
37149,"But I *meant* it. Wooden coasters like Shivering Timbers are what keep people wanting to actually ride wooden coasters. And stuff like SLCs are the eight wonder of the world, why else would there be so many of them? Thunderhawk may be second hand, yes, but who cares? Combine a marvelous creation with a good location on the water, and you get a masterpiece. Why travel to nearby places like Indiana Beach and Cedar Point, where they have unrequited trash like Cornball Express and Steel Vengeance, when you can go to MiA, so close to home, and so fun for the families."
37150,Wait seriously
37151,Carowinds since it has about every coaster you could wish for.
37152,"Once RMC Gwazi opens, I think BGT and SWO will have one of the best coaster collections in the world between them.  They're only an hour away from each other so it's entirely possible to do all of them in one day with time to spare.  Separately though, I think BGT will be top 5 but definitely not #1."
37153,"I would do Busch Gardens one day and Sea World another. That worked out well for me. Let me tell you though, marathoning Mako for 17 rides almost killed me. Don't do that. Lol"
37154,I see nothing wrong with 17 rides on Mako :)
37155,"To be fair, I wasn't used to the Florida humidity and I had already been worn out from riding Manta too many times. I may actually like Manta more than Mako. Kraken being my least. And Kraken is not even a bad ride."
37156,"Don't forget the launch coaster coming to SWO as well. The BGT & SWO combo is strong even without the two additions, I can't wait to get back out there next year."
37157,"Themed: Phantasialand 

Thrill and quantity: Cedar Point"
37158,Six Flags Magic Mountain
37159,"WalibiHolland, Phantasialand"
37160,"I really like King's Island and Hersheypark.  Sure, CP has extreme coasters but the overall  experience just isn't what it used to be.  Also on a smaller level with basically all fantastic coasters look no further than Knoebels and Holiday World.

*Note: Exclude parks out of the US."
37161,"You are right, the overall experience at CP isn't what it used to be. It's WAY cleaner now, events are constantly going on, the food is improved, the employees speak english, and the water park is actually worth visiting now."
37162,There's never been a time that CP wasn't a clean park.  There was a time that they had more of a focus on guest satisfaction though and not on how many fast passes they could possibly sell in a day.
37163,"Nah bro I just disagree. There has been a pretty big shift in the past several years evident in the changes and new marketing. And especially since they just specifically said the focus will be on 'guest experience.' 

Also all parks want to sell fast passes. CP is just annoying cause it's so flippin busy."
37164,KI is great but I have that place a few pegs below both CF CW parks.
37165,"Disney: go here if you love Disney or have kids. If you aren’t a Disney freak (or Star Wars fan?) I’d probably avoid it tbh. 

Universal: compared to other Universal parks in the world, this one is incredibly small and only has one coaster (Mummy).  

Six Flags: go here if you love coasters; this along with Cedar Point are considered the two Coaster Meccas. Not the cleanest park, landscaping is trash, and food is terrible. Quantity>quality

Knotts Berry Farm: go here if you enjoy amusement parks overall. The coasters aren’t as insane as Six Flags, but my favorite coaster in all of California is Ghostrider (I’ve ridden them all). Also has amazing atmosphere, food, and treats.  Quality>quantity 

Sea World: they are focusing more on coasters ever since Blackfish, but I wouldn’t go here unless you are going to stay in San Diego for a few days... there’s better stuff to do in SD than SW imo. 

Other tips: get the flash pass/skip the line/whatever they call it in that particular park. Also arrive 30-60 minutes before the gates open."
37166,Universal also has the Harry Potter ride now! It’s like the Mummy one but even bigger. There’s also a small coaster in the hogwarts area.
37167,"As a dad of two kids and has been through the special hell that are amusement parks here in SoCal, Disneyland is by far the best. 

You pay a premium, but when you go there, it's clean, it doesn't feel cheap or ghetto, and you know where your money went. The other parks, a lot of them almost comparable in price to Dland, are pretty shitty in comparison, with tons of closed rides, closed kiosks, no operational order, and employees with shit attitudes. I'm not saying I want them to be smile robots, but man, if I need to ask you a question, don't stare daggers at me and give me some flippant answer.

I just came back from SeaWorld this weekend and we waiting in line for over an hour to get beer/snacks. Take that in.

edit: just realized you don't have kids...my answer still stands though. If it were just the wife and I, we'd go Dland."
37168,"In rankings from closest to not:

Disneyland & Knotts

Universal

Seaworld & Six flags

Which is best for a day trip?  Well then that depends on budget & preference for rides.

If you like rollercoasters, Knotts.  If you do not like rollercoasters or you want to get fancy insta pics, Disney.

I'm sure, since you can operate Reddit, you can use the internet to determine if you need reservations."
37169,"disneyland will probably be the most memorable. it has a little something for everyone. try to go on a weekday (not friday lol) to avoid the crowds as much as possible.

knotts is also very fun, lots of roller coasters and good food. six flags has better coasters than knotts IMO, but it’s a fair drive.

avoid seaworld at all costs. an unethical and garbage corporation.

can’t say much about universal because i’ve never been, but it doesn’t get as much hype as disney."
37170,"Having grown up in OC, Disneyland and DCA would be my vote for the overall experience, food, theming and rides, but If you're really into roller coasters and thrill rides, I'd say Knotts. It's a good value and the food is getting really great, IMO. Six Flags would be an option but it's a hike from Santa Ana so, meh. Save yourself the drive. 

Seaworld is a skip for me even tho I loved it as a kid. Universal is kinda boring IMO, all the rides there are basically virtual ""put 3D glasses on"", unless you're a big Harry Potter fan it's a skip for me too."
37171,Any favorite rides/attractions in DCA?
37172,"Soarin’, Midway Mania, and the guardians of the galaxy ride (the old tower of terror) are my faves in DCA, but go for the food / drinks too, in normal times we’ll sit at the bar at Lamplight Lounge or Carthay circle lounge, the tasting terrace, etc"
37173,A.F.R.A.I.D.
37174,very cool indeed
37175,Absolutely Disneyland/California Adventure especially based on where you are staying.
37176,"Disney

Also, obligatory PSA - *please, please, please* don't go to Seaworld."
37177,"If you have kids under the age of eight consider Legoland. It’s in Carlsbad in northern San Diego county. Yes, it costs as much as the other places (many people I know think it’s be cheaper ), but little kids can go on every ride."
37178,"Disney is good if (a) you have kids, (b) you want to embrace your inner-child, or (c) you're a couple and want to feel that innocent high school type romance again

Universal is good for media fans, especially Harry Potter

Magic Mountain is good for roller coaster fans

havent been to Knott's in a long time, so can't advise you on the one

dont go to Sea World"
37179,Avoid Universal
37180,Why
37181,"Disney and Knotts will be closest. 

Disney is, in my opinion, the best but it’s also the most expensive and the tamest. Really close to Santa Ana though. You could do Disneyland *or* California Adventure or do both in one day with a Park Hopper. Lines haven’t actually been too and since capacity restrictions lifted, but the *big* popular / new things (Spider-Man in DCA, Rise of the Resistance in Disneyland) require some early morning planning. Good food options, much better if you guys are both actual Disney fans. We used to be annual pass holders when that was still a thing but have gone a few times recently and it was still very fun, despite no fastpass. 

Knotts is, in my opinion, one of the best options for the money. It has the kitschy ghost town area, lots of food, some roller coasters, and it’s pretty affordable. Pretty fun, imo. Still pretty close to Santa Ana. We’re also passholders here. 

Universal is fun *but* imo it’s some of the worst value only because almost all of the rides are simulators. I will say: lines have been short af, Jurassic World and Harry Potter / Forbidden Journey are great, and there are some unique experiences here (specifically the tram tour). More expensive. Tame rides. Farther from Santa Ana but not out of reach at all. We’re also passholders here and go quite a bit, at least once/week. It is a more unique experience, compared to the next one…

Six flags is great *value* if you like roller coasters but is by far the least unique experience (imo) because well, it’s Six Flags. It’s fun - there are a ton of thrilling rides, it’s inexpensive. Pretty bad food and a far drive from Santa Ana. If you guys are all about roller coasters and not theming, this is the one, but in *my* opinion it’s the worst lol. We still have passes for this one too though, only because they’re so goddamn cheap, but as far as a unique experience this ain’t it. 

SeaWorld (all controversies aside) is fun - there are some smaller roller coasters, obviously the sea life, and some actually okay food and drinks. It’s also pretty, and the weather is good. Downside is that it’s pretty far and you *do* have to be into the sea life stuff to really get your value - which may include some of the marine mammal stuff which can get uncomfortable for some. Imo it’s better when there’s a food festival. Honestly I’d skip it though, to be honest. 

All in all if you guys like Disney IP and don’t mind spending the extra money, I’d go with Disney. I think it’s the most unique (very different from WDW in my experiences), memorable, and quintessential, but if you guys will be bored with the tamer rides then you may consider one of the others."
37182,"Born and raised in LA and Disneyland is the best. I’m not a Disney fanatic (in fact, I’m more a movie person so I thought Universal would be more my jam) but Disneyland is pristine. It’s expensive but if you’re gonna make a day out of it, just go to the top"
37183,"PS If you have the money, Disneyland offers private tours where you don’t have to wait in line. It’s insanely expensive but just throwing it out there if money is not an issue"
37184,"Dunno if there are passes available for Disneyland or California Adventure (Marvel’s campus opened 2 weeks ago) but out of all of them: I prefer Disneyland (I am a Star Wars fan) and like snacking and drinking at California Adventure.

If you go I suggest parking across from the park at the Anaheim Hotel- it’s $25 and doesn’t involve a 2 mile hike to a parkade."
37185,"If you're going for the best overall experience inside the park, I say Disneyland. If you're looking for the best roller coasters, then you should go with Six Flags. If you want the best bang for your buck and a great experience outside the park, I'd go with Knott's Berry Farm. 

Personally, I like Knott's, because:

* I felt that the ratio of ride:wait was the best (albeit from my experience a few years ago).
* Compared to the other amusement parks, they were moderately-priced.
* It has lots of variety in rides.
* The food options are decent inside the park.
* There's great Korean food right outside the park, from Korean soups to Korean BBQ. There's also a huge plaza nearby called [The Source](https://www.thesourceoc.com/), which has a lot of things to do and eat.
* There's a [Porto's](https://www.portosbakery.com/) bakery very close to the park. They're a beloved bakery in the Greater Los Angeles area, and I really love their Milk and Berries cake. Their potato balls, Plato de Pollo, and fresh fruit tartlets are also very good."
37186,"I was gonna say that excluding Disney and Universal isn't fair, but then I realized that if they were included they'd just take over every state."
37187,yup
37188,Ohio and Pennsylvania beg to differ.
37189,"Nah, Disney would still win out.  There's thousands upon  thousands of Annual Passholders in OHIO.  It's really insane the reach Disney has for it's parks."
37190,Nah Pennsylvania is spot on
37191,Living in Utah most people out here have never heard of Cedar Point or Kings Island. They are destination parks for enthusiasts but for the general public it's all about Disney...and ever since the Wizarding World opened it extends to Universal.
37192,"Living in Tennessee , I disagree"
37193,You guys are 2 states away from Cedar Point. It's a regional park and you guys aren't that far. When I tell people I'm going to Cedar Point they all ask what it is.
37194,"Despite being a 13 hour drive for me, most of my friends and neighbors down here very much know if cedar point."
37195,"Like I said, you're still close enough for it to be regional for you. You can drive there. Out west it's far less known. Within a few states it's definitely well known."
37196,"It’s “Amusement” parks not “Theme” parks. Although, Knott’s kinda feels like it’s more of a theme park"
37197,I've always considered amusement parks a broader category that also includes theme parks.
37198,Does this exclude Disney and Universal parks?
37200,Does it also exclude seaworld?
37202,"Wow, I'm surprised that BGT is more popular than SWO"
37203,I'm not. BGT in my experience has been busier than SWO.
37204,Probably because the GP doesn't associate BGT with Blackfish.
37205,"Doesn’t look like it, Busch gardens is owned by Seaworld, and i don’t think it would be the most popular anywhere anyway."
37206,I meant the 3 Seaworld parks not other Seaworld owned parks like BGW and BGT.
37207,Florida is BGT so SeaWorld is included
37208,I'd be curious to see which states preferred Disney vs Universal. I'd imagine it'd be heavily in favor of Disney.
37209,You're probably right.
37210,I'm kinda surprised Knotts is more popular than SFMM tbh.
37211,Personal opinion obviously... I feel Knott’s is the far superior park. SFMM really only offers coasters while Knott’s is a much more complete theme park experience. Knott’s coaster lineup is nothing to shake your fist at either. It’s also much closer to LA proper than SFMM is.
37212,All fair points.
37213,"I live in Anaheim, so I'm only 15 or 20 minutes from Knott's, but about 2 hours from Magic Mountain. I go to MM once a year, and that's enough for me, but I just *love* spending time in Knott's. I go like 2 or 3 times a month, and while I try to ride Ghost Rider at least once per visit, most of my time there is spent just wandering around and enjoying the atmosphere. Imo, Ghost Town is the best themed land in the state, and I'll die on that hill."
37214,"i really don’t think it’s a matter of distance. i live in hollywood and the two parks are almost exactly equidistant from me, and, if anything, traffic going south into orange county is much worse. likewise, nearly two million people in the san fernando valley are much closer to magic mountain than knott’s. i really do think it comes down to magic mountain sort of being a shithole (i love it, but it is what it is) and knott’s being well-manicured and lovely. there also were problems with gangs at magic mountain and LA boomers seem to have never forgotten this (it was the first park that had metal detectors in SoCal, and this was a long while before they were installed at other parks)."
37215,They’re both pretty equidistant to LA proper.
37216,"It may not be on Google trends, though. A lot of people refer to each SF park as just ""Six Flags"" rather than its full name, and if you shorten the search term to just that, the difference is stark.

[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-CA&q=six%20flags,knott%27s%20berry%20farm](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-CA&q=six%20flags,knott%27s%20berry%20farm)

I compared Discovery Kingdom to Knott's also, so I don't think it's enough to make up for the gap, and even in the LA area SF is leading."
37217,"I see Knott’s still (just barely) winning in California when I shortened to just Six Flags. That’s when I look at them as topics instead of search terms, which I think is going to give a better sense of which park is searched more by the GP"
37218,"Honestly, it’s probably inly due to it’s proximity to Disneyland. If you’re on vacation for Disneyland, might as well set a day aside to drive the 3 miles and visit another family friendly park with more intense grownup rides as well"
37219,That's definitely a factor for families on vacation. I'd say it even affects the local GP cause Knott's has really been killing it with the food festivals and seasonal events that even rival Disneyland's. Scary Farm within the last 5 years alone has been drawing in TONS of locals (remember one maze getting a 3-4 hour wait last year) and its only getting better.
37220,"Theme Parks tend to have a broader appeal. You can't enjoy a day at SFMM if you don't like coasters where Knott's appeals to a lot more than that. They have fantastic food, decent shows, a cool Ghost Town area, fun family rides and coasters. I'd rather go to SFMM for the coasters but a lot of my non-coaster loving family members prefer Knott's."
37221,"I am not, half of my trips to Magic Mountain involve me wishing I had just gone to Knotts instead.  Often before I even make it into the park.  Twice I have been at SFMM stuck in lines at security, ticketing, and at the gate which left me waiting in total more than two hours to just get into the park.  Both times to find the lines inside the park moving with at worst like a 45 minute wait, frankly the park did not even feel that busy, those kinds of lines just to get into the park are unacceptable.

Combined with single train operations, frequent downtime, terrible food, lack of just about anything but coasters.  I have a much better time at Knotts.  A local might have a better opinion of the park, but as a tourist there are better ways to spend your day."
37222,I always see people crap on Magic Mountain for not having much besides their coasters but I never see that complaint about Cedar Point. SFMM could definitely use more but Cedar Point has some even bigger gaps (like a dark ride) but no one ever talks about that.
37223,"I have seen plenty of complaints about the lack of a dark ride, and the general lack of indoor areas at Cedar Point.  The bathrooms are also from like the 60s or 70s, they clean them but they look extremely old.  Both topics which are brought up to management during Q&A events with enthusiasts annually.  But Cedar Point still has a decent flat ride collection it’s mostly older but they have a good number of them.

Cedar Point and Magic Mountain are only really in competition online, and for a handful of coaster enthusiasts.  SFMM’s main competition is Knott’s, and then Disney and Universal."
37224,"Same. No coaster enthusiest would pick it over Knotts, most of the time. That said, walking around in the parks and laying for crappy food does nothing for me so Knotts brings pretty much nothing extra to the table."
37225,Knott's actually has some of the best food found in theme parks.  They really go the extra mile for guests without the weird corpfeel of Disneyland.
37226,It's decent for a theme park I suppose. Definitely better than MM.
37227,That Chicken Dinner and Knott's Berry Punch make Knott's worth visiting for me. Their food is up there with Dollywood and Silver Dollar City for me as the best theme park food. It's definitely a step above the stuff you get at your typical Six Flags or Cedar Fair park.
37228,Funny how KI and WoF are #1 in multiple other states but not their own.
37229,"Probably one of the best arguments as to why Geauga Lake actually served a purpose aside from ""stealing Cedar Point's business"".  People forget that Ohio is a large state and that people frequently travel across borders."
37230,"Not too surprising in WoF’s case considering it’s proximity to Kansas and Nebraska. And it’s hard to argue against SDC being the hot park of its own state. We discuss HW and KK a lot around here but attendance wise it doesn’t hold up to KI mega pass holder base range that’s just a days trip distance for folks in neighboring states. Same for Michigan, you can’t visit CP without spotting tons of MI license plates and guests wearing MI college or sports apparel."
37231,"That’s kinda why I’m optimistic for WoF’s future. Regional park owned by CF, in a fairly isolated area but in a big city. I think it should be moving in a good direction soon."
37232,"Looking at WoF's history, it seems like Cedar Fair had a lot of interest in the park for the first 15 years or so after they bought it and then haven't bothered to add any major coasters in over a decade. An 11 year drought is pretty shitty of them.

Dorney, ValleyFair and MiA all seem to be in the same boat. I hope you guys all see some new coasters, or at least some good relocations, soon. The theme of WoF seems pretty cool at least."
37233,There's rumors that Dorney's getting rid of Possessed (I hope not) and possibly putting in a gravity group coaster. They have room to build without removing Possessed though
37234,"I think sometimes Cedar Fair will remove rides they don't feel is worth the maintenance cost, even when they don't have a replacement lined up. Us over here at KI just lost Vortex and as far as I know there are no plans in place to put a new coaster in its spot.

I get that ridership was probably low but it was still a great ride. I wish they'd not take prominent coasters out until they have a replacement lined up."
37235,"Yeah I get that. It just sucks because Dorney hasn't had a new coaster in about 15 years, newest being Hydra. Possessed has become expensive to maintain it just sucks because it's a fun coaster"
37236,"I wonder if Cedar Fair decided that trying to compete in that area with Hersheypark and Great Adventure wasn't worth it once they bought the Paramount Parks. And at that point they just kind of left Dorney to wither on the vine.

I hope not. We may see some unexpected closures and relocations as a result of the pandemic if it continues much longer so who knows how things will end up. You guys are certainly past due for some new coasters though."
37237,"I hope not as well. Dorney was the park I went to as a kid all the time. To be fair, it can't compete anymore but easily could have if they added more rides"
37238,"There is a certain point that you can build a park to and then it makes more sense to stop.  One of the biggest lessons in this is Six Flags Worlds of Adventure in which Cedar Fair realized just how hard it is to repair a park that has been destroyed by growth.  Dorney has a charm that the big parks don't have and it's a different experience than the likes of KI and CP.  When I go to Dorney I'm really going for something different than the work that's involved in making sure you get to every ride you want to and if you start adding stuff you actually lessen the draw that Dorney has for me.  Even MiA is in this same classification.  Both of these parks also thrive on the combo of dry/water parks in the same day and, even though I'm not really ac water park guy, these are the parks that I wouldn't mind stopping at the water park because I don't feel like I'm ruining the dry park experience.

Bottom line is this: These small parks aren't aimed at the people that just want to spend the entire day going from ride to ride non-stop.  If you start trying to capture that audience you alienate an entire base of their visitors and net a gain of basically nothing."
37239,"That's a valid perspective. I don't disagree. And I think GL is a good example of too much, too fast.

They wouldn't necessarily have to expand the park to offer something new though. A coaster with low ridership could be replaced, or a strip of restaurants/shops which aren't popular.

I could see Thunderhawk and Steel Force staying put indefinitely since they are well known classics. If I had to pick from the list, I'd go with replacing the Wild Mouse with maybe a spinning coaster like Cobra's Curse if they want to stick with a family friendly option, or a compact Intamin if they want to add another ride for thrill seekers. The Wild Mouse model is everywhere and unremarkable, so nothing unique to the park would be lost.

I agree that not every park has to be huge and cater to coaster enthusiasts. But it wouldn't hurt to put something new in some of these smaller parks. Just to remind their regulars that CF hasn't forgotten about them at least."
37240,"I do have no idea how West Virginians could forsake their own Camden, though. It's unirionically the best part of their backwoods ass-backwards state."
37241,"I live in WV and I'm far closer to Hershey, KW, Knoebels, Dorney, KD, BGW, SFGAd, and probably even Waldameer and even CP.....  Even Carowinds might be closer.

Then again, I don't think Martinsburg counts for this argument ☺"
37242,Honestly I’m not sure what there is to do in ones spare time in a state like WV. I also imagine it’s the least contributive of the non-Ohio Kings Island base. It’s relatively pretty when driving through though on the way to Ohio. Guess I’ll have to check out Camden Park one day. It’s just hard to veer off the major interstates when traveling through these random states.
37243,"It's literally right next to an interstate, Dirk. And Big Dipper's airtime is not to be missed."
37244,Also SFGE
37245,"Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania are all for Hersheypark."
37246,"Well I can guarantee no one was gonna be picking Six Flags America lol so yeah, Hershey it is"
37247,"Yeah, it's even crazy ppl in that state search more for KD than SFA"
37248,I went to SFA once and it was the worst experience I've ever had in an amusement part. Never again. I felt so unsafe on the rides and we only got on 4 rides in 5 hours when the park was basically empty
37249,This excludes Disney and Universal parks.
37250,Now I'm wondering what the map would look like if Disney and Universal parks were included.
37251,it wouldnt look very intresting
37252,Probably all Disney.
37253,"Some things that surprised me when looking through data: KD is more popular in Maryland than Six Flags America, KD is more popular than BGW in Virginia, Kings Island is more popular in Kentucky than Kentucky Kingdom and more popular in Indiana than Holiday World, SFOG is more popular in Alabama than both Park at OWA and Alabama Adventure, Great Escape is the most popular park in Vermont."
37254,"I feel like the KD stuff is off, especially considering how low their attendance is."
37255,"Wonder which specific search terms were checked? Almost all BGW-related searches in VA would be for just ""Busch Gardens"", not ""Busch Gardens Williamsburg"". I checked and searches for just ""Busch Gardens"" consistently top ""Kings Dominion""."
37256,"I measured these by topic, not by search term. Usually when one searches a search term, the related topic pops up. The reason I selected topic is because there exists many alternative search terms for theme parks.

Now that you brought it up though, I went back to double check. BGW actually has a slight edge over KD (measuring topics). However, this was unlike previously, as previously I was comparing 5 theme parks at a time. One of the parks I think was Dollywood, and a part of the eastern Virginia area preferred that park, maybe that's why KD was measured as the most popular - because when comparing just BGW and KD, BGW is more popular in those areas preferring Dollywood, perhaps giving BGW the slight edge. It's very close tho, it's the most polarizing measurement out of all the states I've measured."
37257,"KD pulls in 1.5 million+ visitors every year, I wouldn’t call that low"
37258,"I mean, that's like half of BGW. That's why I think it's weird."
37259,"Well you gotta think about it like this, BGW is mostly pulling in from the tidewater region and southern Va. KD pulls from Richmond and DC/NoVa which are much more populated and people from there probably don’t wanna drive an extra 1.5 hours just to go to BGW. If this map is based off internet searches, KD is located near more densely populated areas which in turn results in more internet searches.

I hope this makes sense, I tried to not sound too technical."
37260,"Sure, I mistakenly thought this was based on something else. That makes sense, at least a little bit. Still seems weird that this many areas draw KD without it having that great of attendance."
37261,"Its not that surprising that KI is more popular than Holiday World in Indiana. Its about the same drive time from Indianapolis to KI as it is to Holiday World and the prices between the parks are not that different. KI is a much bigger park with more coasters and a lot of schools in Indiana take field trips there. Holiday World is great, but its in southern Indiana, which is less populated and is a much smaller park."
37262,Kings Island is also far more popular in the northern part of the state than Holiday World. HW isn't even a blip in the northern third of the state. It's cedar point and Kings island by a mile.
