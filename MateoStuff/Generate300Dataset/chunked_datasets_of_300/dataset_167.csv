54626,"artisan restocks every 3/4 days thers a twitter account tht will notify u whenever they do its called isartisaninstock

just activate the notifs so u can see whenver artisan restocks 

its not tht hard to get an artisan pad really"
54627,"Okay, thank you! I don't think it would be difficult for me personally to acquire, but I do think it would be for my parents. I am asking for a new mousepad for my birthday."
54628,G640 isnt similar to zero soft at all.
54629,What makes the artisan better?
54630,And how are they dissimilar?
54631,"Zero soft is obviously much better quality, a lot more durable and has nice premium feel. It is also considerably faster with less stopping power. I prefer xsoft zero because it is a bit slower. But still faster than G640."
54632,"As G640 owner dont buy it, shitty durability. Because its affected by temperature one day it can feel like a average pad the next day it can turn into pad that has incredibly inconsitent slides (mud pad in the middle, kinda normal on the sides for example)

Its feels like a good mousepad for the like first 2 months of use then it wears out + the inconsistency is cherry on top, honestly one of the worst pads you can buy for the price

Zero (XL) is rn in stock in both MID and xSOFT, theres not any noticable difference between getting MID or xSOFT instead of SOFT from what Ive heard"
54633,"Okay, thank you for your response. Based on what I've heard I think I will avoid the g640."
54634,"Hey there, I have an Artisan Zero Soft that I actually got off of Amazon. It is one hundred percent legit but I guess you have to check the reviews and all that to make sure. That being said, I think some other options I've seen recommended around here are the Razer Gigantus V2 and the X-Ray Pad Aqua Control+?"
54635,"Okay, thank you for your response. What size pad do you have?"
54636,I have a medium.
54637,"Maybe ask for your parents (or whoever is buying the mousepad) to buy the mousepad when it's available (tell them when it's available). Artisan pads are worth it, and imo you shouldn't get anything else. I myself am using an artisan hein fx soft."
54638,"The hien isnt in stock as the soft thickness. If it doesnt go in stock for the next week or 2, should I just go with the mid or just scrap the idea"
54639,"IMO just wait for the zero fix soft. If not, then I heard X-ray makes good pads"
54640,GP4 or AC+ uncoated.
54641,Haven't used it personally but it seems like xtrfy gp4 might be a solid runner up.
54642,Or the ac+ uncoated
54643,How can I tell which one is coated and un coated?
54644,Because where I live I can only get the Grey and orenge pattern ones and the un coated one is the fully black one with no pattern on it right?
54645,"The grey and the rob (red,orange,blue) are both coated.

The white and black are not coated"
54647,Go to hell bot .l.
54648,GP4
54649,Razer Gigantus V2 is a better qck
54650,Apparently the new Lethal Gaming Gear Venus mousepad has similarities to the Hayate Otsu.
54651,"I second this. Never looked back once I tried Artisan, liked the zero and I absolutely love the Hien it’s my main, I do wanna try the Otsu but as u said “always out of stock” so yea give lethal gaming gear a shot. Check out boardzy on YouTube he did a review on it"
54652,"i use an otsu xsoft and can switch between it and the ac+ perfectly. both solid mousepads, wouldn't mind using either. can confidently recommend the aqua control+ black."
54653,Amazing thank you! I'll make sure to take a look at it
54654,Does AC+ have the same speed/control as otsu? Currently have AC+ ROB Strata but feels i need just a tad bit more control. So I am looking to alternatives of Otsu but only not if my AC+ Rob strata is almost the same?
54655,otsu is faster. stopping power is less also. i own the ROB too
54656,"I'll add to this old thread that I got a brita one as I also like my water cold and can't be bothered with complex installations and it's been serving me and my family really well, I like the size of it, holds plenty of water but not too huge so can fit well in my fridge, overall cheap and efficient

edit: the brita I got is the number 1 item here: https://thedailywhey.com/best-water-filters/"
54657,"I had good luck with Pur + Target refills. Under-sink is better, but not an option for many apartment dwellers"
54658,"[Edit Feb 2019]

Apparently people keep finding this post while searching for info on Berkey filters.  So, here's some useful links I found while finishing my research.

Here's The Wirecutter's article on the Berkey:  https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/big-berkey-water-filter-system/

Basically:  If it's not NSF certified, you can't trust it.  ""NSF compliant but not certified"" means ""noncompliant.""  The more ridiculous your claims are about contaminants and longevity, the more expensive it is to do NSF testing.  Therefore, Berkey didn't want to pay the money to back up their claims, so they paid a smaller lab to do cheaper tests that you can't trust.

I ultimately bought the Brita Longlast, which is cheaper and more convenient.  I learned about it through this Wirecutter article:  https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/

None of Berkey's competition in the gravity filter space is NSF certified (I think), so I wouldn't waste your time, money, and counter space on any of them.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

[Original Post Follows]

I'm in the middle of doing research about gravity-fed countertop water filters -- stuff like Berkey's units.  I haven't actually bought one myself; I'm still in the research phase.  Sadly nobody on Reddit seems to be talking about these things outside of doomsday prep subreddits.

Here's Berkey's website (though you probably would end up buying on amazon):  https://www.berkeyfilters.com/

The other main competitor I'm looking at is AquaCera:  http://www.aquacera.com/gravity-systems.html

I'm presently interested in AquaCera's CeraMetix filter elements.  You should replace the filters in units like these once a year because of the potential for bacteria growth (even though they claim to filter bacteria...), so the question is more than just ""What's the price per gallon of a filter element?"" because you're going to replace them yearly.  IIRC the CeraMetix elements are $40 each, and you're going to want two of them each year, probably, which is $80 yearly for filters total.  Berkey's replacement filters are $150 for two, which is too much.  Also, the CeraMetix filters are supposed to filter out fluoride and stuff too without add-ons, so that's an advantage over the Berkey filters.  (Fluoride might be a neurotoxin even at the diluted levels found in fluoridated water, but I haven't done enough research to say with certainty if that's true or not, and is likely outside the scope of this subreddit.)

I currently own a Brita filter, and it doesn't help the water very much at all.  I have not been impressed with it.

While the ZeroWater filter system is in the same ballpark as Berkey and AquaCera in terms of how well they filter the water, their filters last a fraction as long.  Their filters are $15 and filter 40 gallons max.  If you assume a two-person household drinks two gallons of water per person per day, that's ~1,500 gallons a year, and about $560 a year for filters, but only if you replace them every 40 gallons according to the manufacturer.

None of the filter elements are BIFL, obviously."
54660,Have you used the fluoride filters for it?
54662,"They work well?  Ever had your water tested, like plain tap vs berkey water?  

I really want to get one."
54663,I agree with the Berkey love. I've had mine for over a year now it produces great water. I convinced my parents to get one too and they love it. It's a higher initial investment compared to typical filters but the solid carbon block will last a lot longer and actually filter out contaminants.
54664,"We made our own Berkey using a  replacement ceramic filter 4 pack and two large stock pots for much cheaper, and they're cleanable. It's crazy cheap, holds more water than pitchers by far, and tastes amazing. This is definitely the way to go"
54665,"This sounds pretty interesting. How did you set it up specifically? A Berkey sounds great, but $300 sounds pretty steep."
54666,"You drill holes in the bottom of one pot for the filters to screw into, and then set it on top of another pot the same size. Then drill a hole on the bottom pot for the spigot and that's it! There are tons of YouTube videos for diy Berkeys, we watched a lot of those before deciding what to get. We used two large stock pots but you can use 5 gallon food grade buckets too, even cheaper! We have had it about 3 or 4 years now and have barely cleaned the filters and still works like a champ. We use the fluoride and heavy metal filter attachments too. So I think altogether it was around $200 but we haven't spent a penny since! Totally worth it for the quality, nothing touches it"
54667,Don't you still have to buy filters?
54668,"Yes, but not nearly as often, these last years and years. You just scrub them every 6 months or so with a toothbrush until they wear down. We've had this set almost 4 years, and they'll last at least that long more, they seriously last forever lol"
54669,"Stay away from Zerowater and Brita. The filters are tiny and way overpriced. Buy a plain pitcher to store your water in the fridge and fill it from one of these that just screw onto your faucet, no installation required. 

&nbsp;

You can start out with a single counter top water filter and use your choice of at least 50 different filters in it. You can get commercial quality filters for this style that will last an entire year for under $25 online. If you have special filtering needs (want to remove fluoride or bacteria?) you can get a double filter counter top version.

&nbsp;

http://www.purewaterproducts.com/model-77-countertop-water-filter
 
http://www.purewaterproducts.com/model-77-double

You can get these units for much cheaper on eBay and buy filter(s) of your choice. This type of filter is an industry standard size.

&nbsp;

If you want the cleanest water at home I suggest a reverse osmosis counter top system. The initial cost is much higher but you are receiving a better filtered water in return.

54670,"I have a unit like this and it makes my sink leak like crazy. I just checked and there's a large puddle underneath. The sink leaks at the base whenever I flip the switch to use the filter - so it's probably related to the aerator, but it does it with every type I've tried."
54671,A leaky aerator is $10 to replace. There is an O ring at the filter base that needs to be replaced every couple of years that could make the housing leak. The new O ring is $2 to replace.
54672,I've had multiple filters and I've tried multiple O rings/aerators. Still without fail my sink leaks with a filtering unit. I've been told I have to replace the faucet.
54673,I have had mildew get in the Brita pitcher filters twice and twice have made myself sick by drinking filtered water in the Brita pitcher that was from a filter full of mildew.
54674,"Go with Zero. I used to get kidney stones twice a year, no matter how I changed my diet. Eventually I found out the tap water was so bad where I lived that just drinking water was causing stones...and I only drank water out of my Brita. 


Switched to a Zero and haven't had one in four years. They are more expensive, but you can even tell a difference in taste. The water from a Zero is so clean it almost tastes sweet."
54675,I have a Berkey and it is awesome.
54676,"I rock a Berkey. Highly recommend. Sincerely, internet stranger."
54677,Berkey would be the only buy it for life water filters i would recomend. berkeywater.com/big-berkey-system-2-25-gal/
54679,"Zerowater up front tells you, if you're having that problem, then your water sucks. Brita ""doesn't"" have this problem because you're just drinking what the Zerowater is holding onto.

Also, Sam's Club isn't frugal. See if a Costco or BJ's is in your area."
54681,"I'm just saying, it isn't like Zerowater has a design flaw here. The side effect of filtering at the level Zerowater does causes the issue it does. There *shouldn't* be bacteria in municipal water, but it doesn't mean there isn't.

And I agree, there are stronger filters, such as getting a reverse osmosis filter, but I don't suggest those unless you absolutely need it's abilities (most of them aren't fire and forget setups for the average person, and the ones that are are very expensive)."
54682,"> safe to drink

Unless you're in Flint or have rusted pipes, tap water shouldn't be dangerous. For me, a water filter is about taste (our water is limey and the water softener doesn't remove everything), not safety."
54683,"I've owned both. I liked the zero water while I had it, since it filters a lot more stuff than the Brita filter does. Most importantly, the zero water filters removed lead, which was an issue where I lived. Brita filters are just activated carbon, which are only effective at removing chlorine. The thing I didn't like about the zero water filter was that it didn't hold much water. Brita sells much larger jugs which I liked better. Once lead was no longer an issue in my water, I switched back to Brita because I only needed to remove the chlorine, and they held more water."
54684,I have a soma water filter that I like a lot. You can also essentially subscribe to them sending you a new filter every couple months so that you don't have to think about it. And the pitcher itself is nice.
54685,"I still have a few NSA 50c units, they last for 3 years. Killer units."
54686,"I rock an ajax countertop filter and keep a glass flip top bottle in the fridge. Filters are replaceable, cheap and the unit is durable."
54687,"As a reminder, sometimes you can find these things at Goodwill. Some may think that's icky, but the filters are what need to be bought new and you can save bucks on the pitcher."
54688,"I'm a fan of zero. It's not just a matter of lasting longer, but taste which is purely a preference.

Keep an eye on amazon and buy the 8 pack when they go on sale. Filters don't go bad, so doesn't matter if you store them for a year."
54689,"Would you care take a closer look at [alkaline water pitchers](https://diligentchef.com/best-alkaline-water-pitcher/)? These devices produce kangen (alkaline) water which is much more healthier. 

I'm offering you some friendly advice to read this information about benefits of alkaline water: http://www.precisionnutrition.com/alkaline-water-legit-or-hoax"
54690,"According to my experience, pitcher filter don't do much for your water quality (they remove roughly 10% of the contaminants). If you really want to improve your water quality, I suggest looking for an RO system. I personally have very good experiences with the AquaTru waterfilter, which are available in the US and EU. This filter has been thoroughly tested by the NSF, removing up to 99% of all the contaminants in your tapwater, and has been recommended by several experts (among them Dr. Mark Hyman).
I've had the filter since august 2017, and so far, I've got nothing to complain.. The water tastes great, makes me feel good and it's very easy to use. 

For more information: 
https://aquatruwater.eu"
54691,"Check out [Berkey filters](https://reddlink.tech/berkey), EXCELLENT quality, not 'frugal' exactly but they will last. Absolutely worth it."
54692,I use Pur faucet attachment. Replace about 4x per year.
54693,"Just wondering, do you replace them when the light comes on, or do you let them go a bit longer? Mine comes on way more often than 4x a year. I'll usually go a few weeks after before replacing.

Note: the cheapest place for the filters seems to be from BJ's Wholesale Club if you have one near you. There are usually coupons available for them too."
54694,"On mine it seems the light comes on very fast, but I usually just ignore it for a while. I probably replace the filter about as often as OP. Never had a problem, the water always tastes great and fresh even after the light has been red for a while."
54695,"> Just wondering, do you replace them when the light comes on, or do you let them go a bit longer? Mine comes on way more often than 4x a year. I'll usually go a few weeks after before replacing.

I go until I can tell a taste difference, probably not the best method. The red light is probably on for a month or so before I decide to replace. I feel like the light works off of some internal timer which has no measure of how much volume of water filtered in that time, so I guess that's how I justify it."
54696,"> Note: the cheapest place for the filters seems to be from BJ's Wholesale Club if you have one near you.

They beating $7 each? That's what I pay on Amazon and it gets sent right to my door."
54697,"Some times they have a 5 pack for $30...regular price is $40, so slightly less. These are the slightly 'better' (supposedly) filters too. How are you getting them for $7 on amazon? All I see is one filter for $9 something, and that's the 'basic' filter."
54698,"The 3-pack is like $23 right now, so that's $7.66 each."
54699,"I used the Pur faucet attachment for a couple of years but finally stopped because it wasn't a perfect seal. It would drip when you turned the water on (in non-filter mode) and spray water up and to the side if you turned the water up to higher pressure. I even bought a few different gaskets over the years to try to get it to stop, but they never worked completely."
54700,"I read many of those reviews before I purchased. I've only had mine for a year, and it's working pretty well still. I felt like it was inexpensive enough that I could purchase a new filtering mount when those problems arose."
54701,It's plastic.
54702,wat
54703,"Am I the only one who came to this thread hoping the top comment would be something like ""you can just buy a bag of this special sand on Amazon and refill your filters dozens of times for $20""?"
54704,"They say consumers should test their water and not pay for a filter that removes things that are not present in their water. If all you need is to remove the taste of chlorine, try an undersink filter from the hardware store. Just buy the cheapest one. Check the price of new cartridges and divide by the duration in gallons or months. You may find that the limiting factor is the six month replacement schedule and not the number of gallons passed through it."
54705,so how do you test the water to figure out what to remove?
54706,"At my Home Depot they offer free water test kits. There is a small tube inside you fill with tap water and mail it off somewhere.

I did it and never heard back, so ymmv lol"
54707,It's not free if they steal your water
54708,They have water test kits that test everything from just the pH(simple tests) to the more elaborate ones that test for specific metals.
54709,"I use an [API test kit](http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?id=580#.WPw5W4iGOUk) for my aquariums, and you could use them just on your tap water as well. It comes with little dropper bottles to test for a few different things (chlorine, pH levels, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate).

About $70 here in Australia, but I think in the US it's much cheaper, maybe $20-30."
54710,"We have a lot of homes in our area that have well water and there is a lab right in town where we can drop off a water sample. If you live somewhere more urban check your local listings for ""water testing"" they'll send you a container in which to return the water. The cost is pretty reasonable."
54711,"I've been using mavea pitcher to remove chlorine I think, has that smell and slight taste to it. Works great so far."
54712,"I also use a berkey , mostly to remove flouride  and  iron , both levels are to high in my well water. I have used it for six months , and like it ."
54713,"Seriously, the Berkey water filter is the best money I have ever spent."
54714,"I've been using the same filters for two+ years. When it slows down you can clean it with an abrasive pad. See the instructions.

Best water filter ever."
54715,"what do you mean,  do you clean the black elements with an abrasive pad? How do you know the filters are still effective after two+ years as you mentioned?"
54716,"> How do you know the filters are still effective after two+ years as you mentioned?

You could use a TDS meter. That's how I know when my filters are getting ready to die."
54717,Red food coloring
54718,"Totally! According to the instructions, you have to occasionally scrape the black filters with a 3M Scotch-brite pad. Because of the way they are constructed, as long as water goes through the filter it is clean. 

http://www.berkeyfilters.com/berkey-answers/how-to/black-berkey/clean/"
54719,One more happy  Berkey fan.
54720,You have fluoride in well water?
54721,We have naturally occurring fluoride in our water
54722,I had never heard of that.  Thanks for telling me.
54723,"Did they ever resolve the leaking/water bypassing filter issue with their products? WAY too many reports on the forums of bad filters not properly bonded, combined with poor customer service when it was discovered."
54724,"I use a ZeroWater. I live alone but I go through a lot of water to keep my three rabbits going.

So what I do is I filter it first through a cheaper filter then re-filter the ZW to keep their filter going longer. Pur doesn't do a good enough job of filtering by itself."
54725,"I have ZeroWater, and the big blue dispenser tank too. I think the filters last fairly long, wish they would last longer. Only big gripe I have with the filters is they take FOREVER for the water to filter through and fill up the container. Other than that, makes water taste really good and gets the tap water taste out of it completely."
54726,"Yeah. That's the one I have. I actually got a pitcher filter to filter the water first, then put THAT water through the ZW. It's tripled the life span of my big blue box's filters. I have to refill it a lot because the buns drink plenty of water, but as long as I remember to refill it immediately after using it, I never have a problem with running out.

The problem I have with it is I get mildew growing in the top part which gets into the filter and spoils it. I wish it was made of microban or something. As it is I have to take it apart and clean it almost daily because the mildew just keeps coming back."
54727,"Mine only lasts for three weeks tops (household of two), and once the filter is no longer working, makes the water taste even worse then tap water!"
54728,"Wow that is pretty fast. If you like the zero water filters, I'd suggest doing what I do. Have two. Filter the water through one and then the other. When the water reads above the suggested levels, swap that filter to your first stage and put a new one in the second."
54729,Yeah I thought it was weird it makes the water start tasting sour or something after the filter was past its life. Until then the water tastes amazing.
54730,"ZeroWater is the best. The filters last forever, I probably only change it once a year and I use it for everything every day. Yes, I use the tester. Currently having issues with contaminates in city water so my tap isn't really safe to drink. ZeroWater is the only one that filters nitrates besides a reverse osmosis system."
54731,"The cheapest per gallon is a gravity fed filter.  Like a solid filter, like Berkey or Propur."
54732,I use Berkey it works great
54733,Get a reverse osmosis system for like 300$
54734,I remember seeing somewhere that RO systems waste water like 3:1. Is that true?
54735,"that is correct, not sure why someone downvoted you."
54736,I just bought a new one that is 1:1. Much better than the old tech. Taste is amazing and they last a long time.
54737,"I think the newer systems are near 2:1, but still not ideal."
54739,Hooking the toilet drain up to the RO system sounds like a good post for frugaljerk tho.
54740,RO water isn't the best for drinking because it strips out useful minerals.
54741,"This is a myth. We get necessary minerals with food, not with water."
54742,Purely RO yes but some of the higher end machines actually have filters that put minerals back into the water after the water has gone through the RO membrane. Taste is superb.
54743,"I can understand taking out the calcium for the kidney stone sufferers, but the rust (iron oxide) should be left for anemics. Ehh...or sweeping generalizations like this are bad."
54744,"Just something that people should know before drinking RO water. Someone also mentioned that many drinking water RO units will remineralise the water, which I was not aware of. I use a commercial style RO unit which doesn't remineralise, but it's not for drinking. I would just hate for someone to drink RO water, not knowing what it really is."
54745,You could just take a multivitamin.
54746,I would add trace minerals if you had one. Or get a Berkey.
54747,"Berkey water filter. Per gallon cost is around 3 cents I believe.

It is well regarded."
54749,Fluoride filtration isn't one of the most important things when choosing a filter.
54751,Muh pineal gland!
54753,"I like the taste. I hate a lot of spring water. People are weird 

Edit: we have pretty good water close to the great lakes so yeah that too"
54754,Fluoride is an add on to a Berkey.  Berkey wins for the rest of the most important reasons.
54755,"Just in case you're thinking about backpacking, the Sawyer Squeeze is extremely economical, especially if compared to the Lifestraw that has a life measured in orders of magnitude less than the Squeeze."
54756,"Discovered these filters just last night, pretty clever design. Do you own one? I'm curious how well that mylar bag holds up"
54757,"The bags are pretty tough, but not tough enough if you're hiking from Mexico to Canada, but Evernew bladders do better. They're pretty cheap though, and they've improved since the first generation.  One thing I really love about Sawyer is that the threads are the same as a soda bottle, which meant on one trip in the desert I was able to add capacity for free by recycling a bottle."
54758,"Necropost but the Sawyers are absolutely the best portable water filter on the market for backpacking. They're pretty much ubiquitous in the long-distance backpacking community. When I hiked the Appalachian Trail, pretty much every thru-hiker carried one. They are truly fantastic pieces of kit. They will thread to pretty much any standard water bag or water bottle with a screw cap thread so they're enormously versatile, and if you backflush them every now and then, and pre-filter heavily sedimented water through a rag/cloth/buff/shemagh/whatever to get the 'gunk' out before running the water through the Sawyer to filter the microbiological contaminants they will last a **very** long time.   


I'd recommend the Saywer mini because it's lighter and does the exact same job with only a moderately lower flow rate. And toss out the water bag it comes with and pair it up with an Evernew or a Platypus water carry bag with a standard thread which will allow you to filter a lot more water. 12/10 I bring this thing with me literally every time I go hiking. There's nothing in the world quite like freshly filtered spring water.  


There are alternative squeeze filtration systems like the katydin which are fine but Lifestraws in my opinion, while better than nothing, are dreadful in comparison to pretty much any alternative. They're awkward, weigh only a tiny bit less than a sawyer mini, and restrict you to drinking directly from dirty water rather than being able to filter and carry clean water with you when you're on the move."
54759,"Berkey is the way to go. I actually have an extra one if you're interested in buying used. I've had mine for about ten years and I replace the filters annually, although by some accounts on here that's even too often.

It is definitely the best cost/gal filter on the market and you can get filters to handle many kinds of water contamination, including heavy metals."
54760,Read the reviews on Amazon and saw a lot of leaking. What say you?
54761,"I'm not sure what would cause a leak, other than someone assembling it improperly. It's a stainless steel bucket, basically, with a filter inside and a spigot for dispensing the filtered water. There are seals on each of the openings with thumb screws to tighten things up. I check mine any time I notice that something is moving that shouldn't be. Just a quick turn of the screw every now and again and I've never had a leak.

TL;DR - I've never had a leak. Basic maintenance is foolproof because there aren't very many parts to begin with."
54762,"Brita seems to be one of the most common when I search for filters. No one on here seems to have on (or mentioned it). Is Team Frugal against them? If so, why? I'm currently evaluating filters as well. Brita seems to come up as an option and replacement filters are sold everywhere."
54763,I have a brita pitcher and the resulting water tastes good.
54764,I use Pur pitcher. Filters are very reasonably priced. Water tastes great. Very noticeable difference from the tap water I use to fill the reservoir.
54765,Why filter and store water in plastic?
54766,"It isn't in the plastic long enough to cause problems. I empty the pitcher before adding new water, then clean things with soap and water."
54767,"Second the Pur water pitcher. We have gross city water (chlorinated to all hell) and the filter makes it taste so clean and fresh. It's nice to always have tasty cold water in the fridge. It tastes better than Brita, and cleaner too."
54768,"Chlorine will degas out of water if it merely sits in a pitcher, filtered or no. Some municipalities have switched to chloramines though. Does your filter remove chloramines?"
54769,All I know is It removes the chlorine taste and smell.
54770,"Have you tried filling it up and leaving it in the fridge without a filter? 

A lot of the time the chlorine will degas and you can't taste as well when something is cold so just sitting it in the fridge would work just as well."
54771,right but then you have open buckets of water sitting around everywhere.
54772,"Yes, I used Brita for quite a while. Then when they upped their prices on filters, thought I'd give Pur a try. Never looking back."
54774,Wasn't aware Walmart had their own brand of filters for Pur products.

54776,"[Spectrapure RO/DI refurbished](http://spectrapure.com/Refurbished-90-GPD-RODI-System) for $124. Is a hit among coral reef keepers, produces absolutely clean water for demanding reef tanks. Easy to bypass the DI portion of it to produce water for human/animal consumption. This is what I do: RO/DI for reef tank, RO for humans/animals.

TDS(total dissolved solids) meter reads 360-400 ppm(parts per million) tap water, 10ppm after RO and 0ppm after RO/DI."
54777,"I plumbed in a sinktop faucet next to the tap water faucet using a Culligan kit. I replace the filter under the sink every six months. I have it on my Amazon Subscribe And Save list, so it comes automatically every six months, which reminds me to do it. The initial kit was $25 on sale, now it's $35. The replacement filters cost between $22 and $45, depending on the level of filtration you need."
54778,T
54779,"I just use the water filtering pitcher. When the filter stops filtering, just open it up (drill a hole in the top) and pour out the contents. It should be mostly activated charcoal (carbon), and an ion exchange resin. You can buy both in bulk online and simply replace them in the filter housing. I was fortunate enough to find some on sale at Kroger when they were liquidating the Reuse brand products. Each pitcher was $4.99 and came with three filters."
54781,"Oh my gosh, thanks for this.  I'm searching Reddit for info on water filters, found out about Berkey from this thread, and was blown away by the difference in price from your comparison.  I want to verify the price myself before buying, but I'm so glad to have heard about Berkey's competitors.  Thanks!."
54782,A ceramic ultra-filtration water purifier with high initial price but need never replacement of filters.  It should be the cheapest per gallon water purifier available from Amazon.
54783,I use Culligan filter attached to my faucet. Monthly costs is only $10 to replace the filter.
54784,I use the Body Glove BG-3000 mounted to a dedicated faucet in the kitchen sink. The filter costs ~$120 and lasts at least 18 months (with 2 people and a few cats who all drink a lot of water). You can send the old filter back to Body Glove (they pay for shipping) for recycling.
54785,"I got my Aquasana 3 stage under counter from Home Depot. I haven't tested effectiveness, but I do like the way it tastes. It doesn't take up as much space under the sink as a reverse osmosis system and it doesn't waste the water the way RO does, so those were the winning factors for me."
54786,"Culligan, if you can find them, are good quality at a lower price."
54787,Santevia sells the original Nikken model for half the price.
54788,"I liked my Britta pitcher when I lived in town. It wasn't  too expensive, and I didn't have to replace the filter often. I did only get it for taste reasons though."
54789,are the big bottles not better value than filters ?
54790,"Better question would be if you need one. Unless you live in Flint, the tap water is probably so clean that it doesn't need filtering. Your municipal water utility should have quality tests on file."
54791,"Actually most people are getting dosed with chromium six in their water in the US (the ""Erin brockovich chemical"")"
54792,I use zero water; it's slightly more expensive than a Brita but it filters chromium 6 and lead (most filters do not). For me the extra few dollars up front was worth it.

If your water is super dirty, you can get double and tripe housing ones too! More upfront but cheapest in the long run and way better than a Brita in terms of what it filters out."
54796,"I use a ""Woder 10k"" Filter. I've never had the water tested but it tastes great. It removes all of the funky city water taste. It costs around $80 (on sale for $65 right noe on Amazon) to filter 10,000 gallons. For the money, you can't beat it."
54797,I use a Doulton filter
54798,"If you don't mind doing some installation.   Go to Home Depot and look at the whole house cartridge filters.  There is one they sell for $20.  Cartridges are $7.  Will go 6 months easy.  Hook to your cold water under sink, preferably before it goes to ice maker if you have one, then you will be filtering both.  Usually the connections for an  easy install will be less than 15 bucks.  I put these in for people all the time and they love them."
54799,"depends

do you want taste filtering or acutally cleaning?

Acutall cleaning a Berkey  gravity fed can do well,high initial cost  of $300 or(buy the filters for 110 and build your own chamber) but filter cost is good since $110 = 6000 gallons

I think about $50 for the filter cartridge. I like it because the taste is excellent and it's nice that it does so much with just one cartridge."
54804,Did you notice an increase in water usage via waste water with this RO unit?
54805,"I use eSpring from Amway (yes, the MLM company). I think it's $900 to buy the unit and it comes with a filter that lasts about one year of daily use for a family. Replacement filters are $200 or so. The beauty of it is that it's not just a filter, but also passes the water by a UV light to actively kill pathogens. It keeps the fluoride in the water, though (if that's a concern to you)."
54806,I second this. High upfront cost but awesome product.
54807,My concern was how much faster my teeth would get ruined if my water has no fluoride
54808,"Various sources say there is no difference whether or not you ingest fluoride. Fluoride application directly to the teeth by the dentist, however, is proven."
54809,Never heard of that
54810,Now you have.
54811,"No, I only read it I still haven't  *heard* it lol"
54812,"True, true. These days, most things are read, though. Maybe there's a podcast about it. Anyway, I believe the findings that at best, invested fluoride is of no benefit and at worst, it has a negative impact on some people's health."
54813,"I use a Brita faucet filter.  About $30 for the initial filter & add-on, then about $15/filter after that.  Often a little tricky finding compatible filters, but they last a while.  Replacing it around three or four times a year sounds about right.  The light doesn't matter too much, I used my last filter until the water poked a hole through it and it started spraying my ceiling."
54814,If you want a pure water then I'd suggest a distiller. They'll last a long time as well as you can usually fix any of it if you're handy. Only downside is no nutrients or minerals in your water. But nothing like Fluoride either. A lot of filters are just for taste FYI. Be sure you're looking into the filter type and if its doing what you want it to do. Distiller is the only way to get pure water.
54815,I replace my built in water refrigerator filter with whatever is cheap twice a year.
54816,"I recently did a ton of research on this topic for my whole-house water filtration system, so I'm glad I have a chance to share what I've learned.

My conclusion after all the reading was that RO (reverse osmosis) is usually best for wells, or situations where you're worried about things like lead, asbestos, radium, and other heavy metals. These are usually not concerns if you are on city water (unless you live in Michigan). However, RO is not very effective at filtering things like pesticides, herbicides, and chlorine/chloramines. RO is also wasteful (some systems more than others), in some cases the systems waste 2-3 gallons for each drinkable gallon produced.

Carbon filtration isn't the best at removing heavy metals and won't filter stuff like arsenic, but it is great at filtering organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, chlorine/chloramines, etc. There's no wasted water with carbon filtration, so it's cheaper/more-environmentally-friendly.

One piece of wisdom I'll give you is **DO NOT RELY ON MANUFACTURER CLAIMS**. Look for the **""NSF Performance Data Sheet""**, and compare those. If they don't provide a NSF Performance Data Sheet I would not trust them.

Here's a performance data sheet for a [Brondell Undercounter RO ](https://www.brondell.com/media/wysiwyg/water-filters/coral-uc300-100-performance-data-sheet.pdf). Compare this to the performance data sheet of this [Aquasana Undercounter 3-Stage Carbon filter](https://cdn.aquasana.com/assets/AQ-5300+_Performance_Data.pdf).

They are both certified for NSF42, NSF53, but the Carbon Filter is also certified for NSF401 and NSFP473 (look at the data sheets above to see exactly what that covers).

For me a 3-stage carbon filter was the better choice. It wastes no water and filters out everything that would be an issue on my water supply, including lots of things that RO won't.

As for which brand you go with? Just compare Performance Data Sheets and costs of different products to find the best bang-for-your-buck. I didn't go with either of the above brands for my whole-house system (I went with a Springwell system), but if I was going to buy an under-counter system I'd probably get that Aquasana AQ-5300+."
54817,"Hi glad I have a chance to share what I've learned, I'm Dad👨"
54818,Exactly what i was looking for! Thanks so much! I felt like the RO would be overkill for my city water but am more concerned with the organic compounds. It seems like so many filters claim the same things but performance widely varies. Appreciate you sharing your research!
54819,"Just found that the NY Times Wirecutter recommends the AQ-5300+ as their ""Upgrade pick"" for ""[Best Under-Sink Water Filter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-under-sink-water-filter/)"".

I generally agree with their reviews. They explain their methodologies well and are usually very thorough. I do my own research on products and often come to the same conclusion as them. (For example just now in my comment above)."
54820,"I live in an area with problems with arsenic and chromium in the water supply.  I have a TDS meter that measures total dissolved solids in the water.  I measured tap water, water from a brita/pur type filter attached to the faucet and water from a reverse osmosis unit that goes under the sink.  The tap water had TDS of say 136 ppm or something (I can't remember the exact number), the brita/pur type filter maybe reduced that to something like 133, if at all, and the reverse osmosis unit reduced it to like 10 or something.  That should give you an idea about what each does to things dissolved in the water.  Plus the water tastes great from the reverse osmosis unit!  Pure water tastes amazing.  Throw on a deionizing filter (~$30 and lasts years) after the RO unit and the water tastes even better and the ppm can get down to 1-3ppm.

The brita/pur type are an enormous waste of money in my opinion, they may remove some chlorine and make it taste slightly better, but you are basically wasting $30 every few months.  My parents have wasted hundreds of dollars on those when you can get a reverse osmosis unit from amazon for ~$150 and install it yourself quite easily."
54822,"Just under a sink and has a separate faucet, but it is easy to get used to only using that water for drinking and cooking.  It looks like this.-

http://www.amazon.com/5-Stage-Reverse-Osmosis-Drinking-System/dp/B008LH9SBQ/ref=sr_1_25?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1368389758&sr=1-25&keywords=reverse+osmosis"
54823,"[From the page about Brita filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brita), it says that they are not meant to truly purfiy water, but to remove the halogen compounds, like chlorine, that cause your tap water to smell and have a bad taste. They also soften your water. Your tap water quality is highly dependent on your municipality and the age/material of your pipes, but due to federal regulations, should always be potable."
54824,"I think it depends on the water in your home. I have a well and I have a water softener and a filter to keep silt out of the softener. The water has been analyzed and is completely safe for what matters. The softener is there because of calcium which basically eats fixtures and makes soap not work properly. 

Most municipalities have clean water which is carefully monitored (and more regulated than bottled water). Of course, mistakes happen. The major danger would be from bacteria, which usually are not removed by a filter though you can get systems which do kill bacteria. 

Some people find the taste of water (well or otherwise) disagreeable and in these cases, depending on the cause, filters help.

That being said, for the most part, most Britta water filters don't really do much good for most people."
54825,"I'm not sure if Brita filters remove halogen compounds, but the carbon filter improves the taste. 

Brita is a decent filter, but you have to keep in mind that it removes suspended solids. This includes calcium or iron buildups and particles that broke off from the inside of the pipes. Brita filter do NOT remove suspended solids. Intertron's test backs this up. Dissolved solids include dissolved organics, halogens, and Ca and Mg (""hardness"", though Brita has ion exchange resins that treat this to an extent).

I don't think it's a bad idea to filter your water. The benefits are marginal, but if you like the taste and don't mind spending the money then have at it.

If you are concerned with halogen content, then you should invest in an RO unit."
54826,"There is a variety of good and not so good feedback.  In general the consensus is that Brita filters do remove some things, but not ALL the things.

Brita filters tend to be filters based on the use of activated carbon(AC), while I don't know specifically what type of AC, I do know that AC has been known to be tailored to target specific contaminants to some extent. (I actually took a graduate course titled Activated Carbon)

So there are two big principles associated with filters and specifically Brita filters. 1) is actual filtration.  You mention it by talking about larger particles.  This is often referred to as turbidity, and it is the things that aren't dissolved in water.  Things like microorganisms, insoluble minerals, etc. The removal of these things is dependent on their size and the media size.
2) is the ability of AC to adsorb (adhere to the surface of) charged particles. This is how you get the removal of ions and organic contaminants.  The AC is an extremely porous media (my professor said that a particle has the surface area of a football field - this is conjecture just to give you an idea of extent of surface area) and throughout the surface there are different functional groups that help facilitate binding.  

Someone elsewhere said that britas are good for ions but not organics, this is not necessarily true. Some organics, sure. AC is often used in water treatment plants to reduce their organic load prior to disinfection.  It really depends on the organics in the water at the time and the carbon its self. 

I have seen some work in developing communities where they use a combination of AC with slow sand filters, to treat drinking water.  The sand filters are better at removing microorganisms, which are often too small for AC media to remove, and the AC removes other contaminants.

Ultimately, I would say that I wouldn't necessarily trust a brita alone if you don't know the drinking water quality.  A virus is pretty small and can get through pretty easily. Someone mentioned using brita and boiling, this could give you a decent water (depending on source.) As a suggestion though (my hurricane survival strategy) is Brita + couple drops of bleach.  The inactivation of microbes from the bleach is usually pretty good, and you don't have to boil the water.


Ultimately, I don't have a real answer to your question.  The brita can potentially make your water safer to drink and remove nasty things like Mercury or toxic organic compounds, but I can't issue a blanket statement saying that Brita just makes your water safe.  It is great for polishing already treated water, and really good at removing chlorine taste (AC sucks up chlorine like it is its job)."
54827,"> Brita + couple drops of bleach

Into what quantity of water? A gallon or so?"
54828,"Couple drops per liter.  I'd shake it up for a bit, lit it sit a few minutes then open it up.  If you smell faint chlorine smell then you are good to go, if you don't it is likely that you haven't fully inactivated everything in the water, so repeat the process. 

The smell of the chlorine is a good sign because it means everything that can be inactivated, is likely inactivated. I will say that this isn't full proof either.  Certain spores and viruses are resistant to chlorination, but I feel this is a good enough precaution in emergency situations."
54829,"For your consideration: These are Clorox's recommended steps [from their FAQ](http://www.clorox.com/products/clorox-regular-bleach/faq/):

1. Remove suspended particles by filtering or letting particles settle to the bottom.

2. Pour off clear water into a clean container.

3. Add 8 drops of Clorox® Regular-Bleach (not scented or Clorox® Plus® bleaches) to one gallon of water (2 drops to 1 quart). For cloudy water, use 16 drops per gallon of water (4 drops to 1 quart).

4. Allow the treated water to stand for 30 minutes. Water should have a slight bleach odor. If not, repeat and wait another 15 minutes. The treated water can then be made palatable by pouring it between clean containers several times."
54830,"Another way of making it palatable, and masking any residual bleachy taste, is to add 2 drops/qt or litre of oil of peppermint, avail at almost any pharmacy. One of my best lines of defence while travelling in SE asia is a small squeezebottle of 10:1 bleach: peppermint oil."
54831,"this is cool, thanks for this!

Matches pretty well with my process."
54832,"[this](http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.asp) is the center for disease control official recipe for sanitizing solution. make sure to use the word ""drops"" conservatively because it only takes a teaspoon per gallon to turn water into cleanser. the words drops, for this conversation needs to be standardized. per this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_%28unit%29 drops can mean 

>1/20 mL (50 μL)

>1/12 mL (83⅓ μL)

>or 1/96 of a teaspoon... (approximately 51 μL)."
54833,">Certain spores and viruses are resistant to chlorination

Holy shit, what the hell are those? How can they possibly survive chlorination?"
54834,"I don't have some of my lit on disinfection with me right now (nor can I find what I'm looking for online)

I realize I said spore, but I mean cyst.  (I'm not a microbiologist, sorry!)
Cysts tend to be really hardy, because they've evolved to protect the genetic material in harsh conditions. Viruses also are pretty hardy.  

I'm also referring to disinfection, not just chlorination. This varies greatly depending on the form of disinfection you are performing. In my field we use a something called the C-t value.  Which represents the concentration (of disinfectant in mg/l) times contact time (in minutes). You can meet these values using a variety of disinfectants (things like Free chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide, or ozone). Each of these interacts with microbes differently.

There exists [something called a CT table](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fishw/UO_CT-Glossary.pdf)
which is used to determine what CT value you need to inactivate certain microbes with different disinfectants. 

To answer your question, the common cyst mentioned are Giardia cysts, which require much higher CT values.  Viruses are varied, but bacteria like E.coli tend to be pretty easy and treated by most disinfection processes pretty easily."
54835,"Spore can also be acurate as bacterial endospores are resistant to bleaching as well as just about everything else we can throw at them. Species of bacteria that can form endospores include C. tetani (causes tetanus), B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. anthracis (bacteria causing anthrax)."
54836,"Couple drops per liter, as far as i know its around half a caps worth, and regarding the ""resistant to chlorination"" bit, that's why you should boil it afterwards too... 

Most filtration systems are as good as the smallest particle they can stop."
54837,What the surface charge of activated carbon in water?
54838,"surface charge tends to be pH driven.  A common figure that you'll see in papers is a point of zero charge diagram. 

Natural organic matter, often referred to as NOM, which is a water contaminant that is often removed by AC has a negative charge in water. 
Carbon can have either a negative or positive charge depending on the carbon properties its self and the pH.  So if you are removing NOM you want to have a carbon with a positive surface charge. 

[Not sure if you have access to it or not, but this article has a couple of good figures illustrating what I've shown above.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979798959756)"
54839,"While I agree with you with respect to carbon adsorption, I feel it is relevant to note that with minor changes in water chemistry and constituents (pH, silica, zirconium), the adsorption preferences of granulated activated carbon change significantly. For things like arsenic, which are non-acute contaminants (generally speaking in drinking water), it would be unlikely based on ion-selectivity of the carbon that you would have any effective removal. [Adedge](http://www.adedgetechnologies.com/technology/overview.htm) has a great amount of research concerning arsenic and uranium removal. Their media is a granular ferric hydroxide and the page describes common interactions with ions which decrease efficacy of adsorbtive media. If you really want in depth and highly technical answers, see [this](http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009FDL.PDF) EPA study.

Now, if you are dealing with acute inorganic and non-biotic contaminants such as nitrate (infants are especially vulnerable), there will be little to no removal given the nature of the molecule. If you are on a private well and are on septic, have your well tested for nitrate and coliform bacteria annually or more frequently. FYI 40 CFR 141.23, 24 and 26 is the safe drinking water act maximum contaminant levels of inorganic, organic, and radionuclide contaminants. 10mg/L is the nitrate MCL and water above this level is considered a very high risk to public health and generally considered non-potable (in the US). 

Where the OP may have some success with a brita filter would be with turbidity and total dissolved solids. As nopropulsion noted, cryptosporidium, giradia and other microscopic nasties are harbored by turbidity and TDS. While it would be unlikely that you would have total removal, it would be synergistic to filter and then try for microbial inactivation with chlorine. Essentially, you are removing protective environments for the microbes and allowing for more contact time for chlorine with microbes rather than organic matter. This would be assuming you are starting with non potable water.

Ultimately, activated carbon is typically geared for aesthetic improvement. Removing halogenated organic compounds and chloramines, which are compounds that form in chlorinated water, is the typical mission of a brita filter. Taste and odor improvement yes, health issues, probably not.

Additionally, for chlorine odor issues, call your water provider and ask them if they are currently meeting proper [chlorination breakpoint](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=breakpoint+chlorination&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1680&bih=935&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=umZr92Ir4Z1TJM:&imgrefurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/chlorine.html&docid=eK-wv8AqT-BG2M&imgurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/zones.gif&w=947&h=690&ei=YcHmTsfcBbKGiQLXhNj9Bg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=873&vpy=159&dur=304&hovh=133&hovw=183&tx=177&ty=79&sig=102303205236723783424&page=1&tbnh=131&tbnw=180&start=0&ndsp=41&ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0). Often times, if there is a strong chlorine odor, the water treatment operators have actually not added enough chlorine."
54840,"I absolute and utterly agree with thechemistree.  


It is hard to answer if ""water will be safe"" when you know nothing about the water quality going in. Which brings me to a pet peeve of mine, and it is how little most people know about their water and where it comes from."
54841,"I agree and I bet I'm preaching to the choir here. I'm not sure if it's sad or just funny to me to hear folks talk about how their tap water in a major municipality ""just isn't safe"". The public in general has absolutely no idea how many millions of dollars, massive amount of environmental/public health engineering, and regulatory oversight go into their drinking water."
54842,do you know what specific factors influence AC adsorption? what sorts of organics are likely to stick?
54843,"Before I get into it, let me state that I specialize in ion exchange not AC and I took this class several years ago.


A big factor is pore size distribution. A lot of what governs removal is transport within the carbon. If a molecule is too large, it isn't likely to be able to travel in the pores of the carbon, thus is unable to be removed. 

In addition to steric effects, structural properties of the molecules matter and so do the surface functional groups of the carbon.  I'm no  expert on AC, but I do know that carbon tends to make use of Van der Waal's forces and that alcohols tend to not be removed.  If you need/want more info I can look further into it."
54844,what about minerals that might be filtered out? Do we get any chunk of nutrition from what's in our water?
54846,"Activated carbon doesn't tend to remove all the minerals.  Processes like reverse osmosis is where you see the complete removal of water constituents that may be harmful.

I'm unfamiliar with the negative repercussions of drinking distilled water exclusively, but it is my understanding that it is not ideal.  Someone with a medical background would likely have to chime in.  

My guess is that the difference in activity of the water will cause osmotic pressure differences internally which would not be good in your organs.  That coupled with missing out on some key micronutrients seems bad."
54847,"Some countries still have water towers made of asbestos.

Does asbestos from water towers contaminate the water? Is there a suitable filter to remove it?"
54848,"my understanding of asbestos is that the problem with asbestos is that it is friable and damages the lungs when inhaled. 

I've not seen much regarding the consumption of asbestos. [here is a link to a WHO report that says there is no increased incidence of cancer through ingestion](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/asbestos.pdf)"
54849,"When I went backpacking, we would gather water from the stream, drop a couple drops of iodine, wait X minutes, then drink it. Is iodine as effective as bleach?"
54850,"yeah, Iodine is a halogen and thus oxidizes compounds pretty well. When disinfecting or inactivating microorganisms, what is actually occurring is that the disinfectant is oxidizing the microorganism and killing it. So iodine is behaving much like chlorine would.

I believe that iodine used to be used in swimming pools.  The drawback to iodine is color and taste. I'm not sure that it is AS effective as bleach, I've not really looked into it."
54851,"In my backpacking experience, where it is often impractical to pack sufficient water for the duration of a journey, I have experimented with various methods of water purification. Although I have never used bleach, my preferred method is to use iodine drops or tablets in conjunction with ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Adding ascorbic after iodine treatment precipitates the iodine out of solution and removes that nasty iodine taste. The procedure is as follows:

* add iodine to the untreated water (for iodine solution, add 5 drops per quart when the water is clear, 10 drops per quart when the water is cloudy)
* shake and let stand for 30 minutes to one hour (depending on who you ask)
* at this point the water should be safe to drink
* add ascorbic acid (usually in tablet form) 
* shake and let stand for ~10 minutes
* enjoy!

Some other thing to take into consideration (from [OA Guide to Water Purification](http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml)):
>It is important to note that you are using the iodine solution to treat the water, not the iodine crystals. The concentration of iodine in a crystal is poisonous and can burn tissue or eyes.

>In order to destroy Giardia cysts, the drinking water must be at least 68° F (20° C). The water can be warmed in the sun before treating or hot water can be added. Refill the treatment bottle after use so that the solution will be ready one hour later.

>Be aware that some people are allergic to iodine and cannot use it as a form of water purification. Persons with thyroid problems or on lithum, women over fifty, and pregnant women should consult their physician prior to using iodine for purification. Also, some people who are allergic to shellfish are also allergic to iodine."
54852,"I work at a [company that makes water purification products](http://halosource.com/). I'm in IT, so I don't understand all the chemistry stuff the magicians in the labs do, but it's been explained to me as such: A product like a Brita filter removes particulates from the water like dirt, debris, etc. Our products, however, have ionically charged beads that kill bacteria and viruses (without the needs for chemical additives) in addition to filtering out particles. So such products exist."
54853,This sounds more like an advertisement than an actual contribution. Could you please explain how such technology works? Maybe add to the conversation?
54854,"Didn't intend for that to come out as a sales pitch, merely pointing out that portable filters that make contaminated water safe to drink *do* exist.

As I mentioned before, I'm not one of the scientists that works on these things, so I don't really know the details of how the system works, only that a cartridge filled with polystyrene beads that have been infused with halogens are able to ionically kill bacteria and viruses that pass through it.

54855,"> Our products, however, have ionically charged beads that kill bacteria and viruses

The [Gallery of water-related pseudoscience](http://www.chem1.com/CQ/gallery.html) has a number of entries that sound similar to this - e.g. search the page for ""bead"".  Does your employer have any sort of scientific support for their claims?"
54856,[yep.](http://www.halopure.com/how/how-it-works)
54857,"No offense, but that page contains marketing claims, not scientific support.  There's also a link to a PDF containing an economic impact study, which says nothing about the filter's effectiveness or operation.

""Scientific support"" would typically at least involve a study by an independent lab which assesses the filter's effectiveness on different types of contaminants."
54858,"Sorry, I must admit I probably got in over my head here, [will these suffice](http://www.halopure.com/what/scientific-papers)?"
54859,"That's much better, thanks, and certainly helps credibility compared to the claims on that pseudoscience page I linked to.

I haven't gone over the references in any detail yet, but one link that still seems to be missing is the connection between that research and the actual product.  Again, a study of the product by an independent lab would provide that link.  Some feedback for your boss' boss.. :)"
54860,"I am a graduate student who studies drinking water.  To answer your question directly, brita filters use a media that we call Granular Activated Carbon.  The media is very porous with a large amount of binding sites which adsorb molecules regardless of size.  Actually, the mechanism of filtering by 'sieving' is really not applicable since in tap water you won't have particles that big anyway.  

To simply answer your question if it is 'safer'... in theory yes, but not really.  If you live in a 1st world country your tap water is very very safe and a brita filter will do basically nothing to the microbiological content of the water.  If anything it will actually increase it (although likely not pathogenic) since activated carbon is a good support for biological growth.  The brita filters will remove disinfection by-products from chlorination, organic material, and other trace level contaminants but really the regulated levels of these are already safe.  It will also remove chlorine/chloramines which can contribute to bad taste etc.  If I recall correctly, some brita filters have ion exchange membranes which can potentially remove some metals, but again regulated levels of these are already below a threshold which we believe will have a substantial impact on the health of the general public."
54861,"> If you live in a 1st world country your tap water is very very safe 

Safe, maybe.  Drinkable, not necessarily.  I live in a town with pretty icky-tasting hard water.  Brita-type filters at least make the stuff more drinkable."
54863,"solid video, very concise lecture."
54865,"This example is a bit anecdotal. 
Yes, metals and ions are pretty likely to be removed, I disagree that organic molecules remain.  

I've explained this elsewhere in this thread, so I'll be brief here.  Activated Carbon is the stuff in Brita filters that do most of the treatment of water.  Activated carbon is often used in water treatment systems to remove organic matter from water, to prevent the formation of disinfection by-products, or it is used to remove disinfection by-products.

[This paper analyzed home use water filters for their removal of disinfection by products (which are organic molecules)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jctb.1087/full) and found that they had good performance."
54866,"Yes, activated carbon is good at removing organic compounds, however it is not good at removing compounds such as metals and ions at all.

Brita filters used to only employ activated carbon.  The main purpose was to remove chlorine to make the water taste better.  It does have an added health benefit of removing halogenated organic compounds and other toxic byproducts of chlorination.  It does adsorb some arsenic, but not very efficiently at neutral pH.

I believe most Brita-type water filters now use a mixture of activated carbon and ion-exchange resin.  If you crack one open, you can see the black stuff which is activated carbon and little balls (usually green and yellow) which is the ion-exchange resin.  This is more effective at removing metals and ions.

Of course, most people neglect changing the filter, which defeats the whole purpose.  In fact, some studies have shown that ion-exchange resin tends to leach adsorbed ions at a high rate once it becomes saturated.  Additionally, bacteria and fungi can grow on the activated carbon and release endotoxins that can make you sick or cause chronic inflammation.  If you don't maintain your filters, you are better off drinking straight tap water."
54867,This is a great point.  I wasn't sure if commercial filters like Brita used ion exchange resins.
54868,"I thought the same thing, that activated carbon does indeed bind organic compounds. The source of the confusion may be that his measurements do not measure the types of organic compounds that are absorbed. It is possible to miss large swaths of different types of organic compounds, depending on how your mass spec is set up."
54869,Is this just the nature of an activated carbon filter? Why is this the case? What sort of filter material manages to get the organics out (if possible)?
54871,Reverse osmosis is amazing! We had one for a salt water fish tank (mixing the purified water with salt). Took our water from 400 to 4 ppm! *FOUR!* That is just crazy.
54872,I run 7 stage reverse osmosis / de-ionization for my reef tanks and my TDS meters read at 0-1ppm.
54873,"I think ours was a four or five stage... Bringing it down to 0–1ppm is insane! It always boggled me that one could ""make"" water that pure without some kind of laboratory."
54874,"Laboratory here. The filter unit we use is from [Millipore](http://www.millipore.com/catalogue/module/C79625). It produces water below 5 parts per billion. List price is $12k but I got it down to >$5k with trade-in. The part I think is cool is that the water basically doesn't conduct electricity anymore at that purity. The purity is measured in part by using its resistivity, which is extremely high."
54875,"When I use milli-Q water for my experiments, I have to degas it to get any last bit of dissolved gases out. It always amazes me how how pure the water can get, and how even the slightest impurities can affect my results."
54876,Do you freeze-pump-thaw to remove gasses?  Just curious.
54877,I pump Argon through with stirring for about 30 minutes.
54878,"Biochemist here, half of what I do wouldn't be possible without equipment like that millipore unit. Our unit is painfully slow though."
54879,"How often do you change the filters? I think when the unit is running less than 1 L/min, the bacterial filter [not shown on this unit](http://imgur.com/ooz9o) should be changed. If you change the big cartridges every year then you should change the bacterial filter every six months or so."
54880,"Honestly, I have no clue. We have a lab tech who is in charge of the shared facilities equipment in the room (autoclaves and such) so for the a great deal of science I hope the answer is ""often"". I've always had clean electropherograms on my CE, but come to think of it, we have had some strange results on some PCR's the undergrads have run. Thanks for the tip and I'll check in with the tech at some point about this. I do know that it's flowing way under a liter per min, it's usually a 45 minute~hour ordeal for the undergrads to fill up our 20L holders."
54881,"This isn't related to the original question, but it's still scientific so here goes:

How significant is the difference between the water from the Millipore and the water that comes out of the deionized water taps in most labs?  Specifically, does the deionized water act as an electrolyte to a significantly greater extent?"
54882,Hate to ask this here but it seems like some of you might know. Where could I get a good R.O. machine? I am concerned about the quality of the water in my home and was wondering if anyone could tell me of a reliable manufacturer of these. How much does a good R.O. machine cost? Do you need to add minerals back to the water before drinking it?
54883,"I assume the filters are probably about the same regardless of brand so you may as well go w/ the least expensive option. I have a 5 stage Water General RO-585 filter which has worked well on our nasty well water for a couple years now. $143 at filter direct. http://filterdirect.com/index.php?cPath=22

Edit- the way it works is it adds a 2nd spout (probably at your kitchen sink for drinking water). It takes most of the minerals and hopefully any contaminates out of the water and it tastes just like a bottle of water you would buy at the store."
54884,"We have well water, and it's been stinky lately, thanks for this. Would've never though about R.O."
54885,"ebay.  there's a lot of them out there.  I picked up a 7 stage system, with tank, tap, TDS meter, etc.  $130ish, and my TDS is 0 to 2 PPM."
54886,Does R.O. take out fluoride?
54887,"Yeah, around 80-90%"
54904,http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/michael_pritchard_invents_a_water_filter.html
54889,"RO is not what is necessary.  Activated carbon is actually effective at removing organics.  

I've posted throughout this thread, but here is a [link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jctb.1087/full) to a paper showing that carbon based filters like the brita remove out organics.

It isn't the ""filtering"" ability of the media that removes the organics, it is the chemical properties associated with the surface that causes them to bind with the surface of the activated carbon, thus removing it."
54890,I personally would appreciate it. I notice a significantly improved taste and visual clarity to my water after a pitcher filtration (extremely old municipal pipes)
54891,"A lot of this is based less on making the water safer than it is on making the water more palatable. 

In the US and most developed countries, tap water should be pretty safe.  These filters help remove some metallic taste.  It is especially good at removing chlorine, which is often people's big taste complaint with tap water. 

I'm guessing if you have old municipal pipes, it is likely you have more dissolved metals in your water and potentially higher chlorine content to help with disinfection.  



Edit:
** I don't mean to hijack this comment, but I just want to say that the top comment is not sound science and based on his anecdotal experience.  For example, activated carbon is KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO REMOVE ORGANICS! (which is contrary to what the author has stated, he may have been dealing with alcohols or diols, which aren't easily removed by carbon)**"
54892,"My tap water is perfectly fine, but just too hard, so I use these filters simply for making it 'softer'."
54893,Cloudy water is often just the result of trapped air bubbles.
54894,"Definitely, but it's also sometimes possible to see actual sediments in the water if it's from certain sources."
54895,"the house at the end of my street is also the end of the water main, every month they must disassemble their taps to remove sandy sediment or else they will clog completely.
It has a high turnover rate of owners"
54896,There are whole house filters for that kind of stuff.
54897,"Living in a town with lots of sediment, I got one.  It is amazing.  I can drink my tap water.  My hot water doesn't smell so terrible all the time.  My dishes don't come out without spots.  (I realize this is anecdotal, but I thought I'd throw it out there).  I'm hoping it will cause my new water heater to last longer."
54899,"I have a whole-house filter because I use well water.  The filter is a snap to change.  You unscrew a cup-shaped thing that the filter sits in.  Dump out the old filter, put in the new one.

HOWEVER, be sure that when the filter is installed, its plumbinb is fitted with a bypass valve.  Otherwise, it would be a pain because you would have to shut off the water for your whole house and drain the pipes to change it.  A plumber will charge you about $250 in my area to put one in, plus the cost of the filter.  You most likely have to sweat copper to do it.  We added ours during construction when the tools were available."
54900,"Every three months.  I have a special wrench.  Not difficult.  It is about a one liter container that you have to twist off and twist a new one on.  They're about $20, but what I save in water damage is well worth it."
54901,"> My hot water doesn't smell so terrible all the time

Did it smell bad the entire time the hot water was on, or just the first few seconds? I believe I may have the same problem."
54902,"I feel like it was an olfactory thing where you got use to it after a second, but it still smelled.  I hated showering in it.  I never felt like I got ""clean."""
54903,Which is exactly what an activated carbon filter will remove. Plus the odd tastes and colors from small molecules
54905,"What about reverse osmosis filtration? Does that remove the same things, or does it remove more or different impurities?"
54906,"RO filtration can many times eliminate almost any sort of impurity because it relies on huge pressure to pass water through nearly impermeable membranes. If you use enough pressure with small enough filter, nearly pure H2O is possible."
54907,"In this case you have [other things to worry about](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water#Health_effects_of_drinking_purified_water)


>Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water which is not an ideal replacement for drinking water. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily absorbs them, and because the presence of calcium and magnesium in water can prevent absorption of lead and cadmium."
54908,I would assume that's why [Pur makes a filter that adds minerals](http://www.purwater.com/pur-products/faucet-water-filter/mineralclear.html)?
54909,"It could be yes, it might just be marketing. 

The need to use filters like that is honestly alien to me and if such a product was sold in my Country (Netherlands) with the requirements that we have on tap water I would be very skeptical about using it and the claimed benefits and health hazards."
54910,"In the US a lot of houses have private wells for their water, and therefore aren't necessarily following all the requirements. I haven't got the slightest clue what the laws are about creating a new well, but I know that old wells were not monitored/tested (or at least not well) for drinkability."
54911,"Our standards for water mains in the US are terrible. There was a great post on it by a water engineer a year+ ago (I remember because I read it before moving). Basically we have to keep the water pressure really high to push out all the dirt getting in, and a lot of our sewer lines are at the same depth as water mains instead of much lower, so poop water can get in if the water pressure drops for any period of time."
54912,"It's also why the ingredients to Dasani water isn't just water, they use a high grade filtration process like that, they filter out just about all the minerals, and that means they filter out the taste of the local water. They then have to add minerals back into it to make it drinkable (it tastes terrible without the minerals). This also means that it tastes exactly the same no matter what the water source is (which is great for a company like coca-cola that sells everywhere in the country and has hundreds of water sources)."
54913,I always thought of it as filtered tap water with salt added.
54914,That's what it is.
54915,"Ultra-pure water doesn't taste like anything. Thats why Dasani adds minerals, to make it taste like water."
54916,"This is startling. The ship I served on for the last 5 years, USS Thach FFG-43, uses 3 large RO units to make drinking water for the crew....  I wonder if thats the case around the Navy. I also wonder if thats an accepted negative due to the need for drinking water for long underways. Thanks for the information."
54917,Just because it was filtered via RO doesn't mean that was the only process it went through. A multi-stage water treatment system can start with RO and then pass the pure water through something that adds salts back in.
54918,"I am not saying that RO filtered water by definition is bad, I know that at least Singapore does use it as tap water. I was responding to 
>If you use enough pressure with small enough filter, nearly pure H2O is possible."
54919,All Navy ships filter the sea water for drinking.  Aren't you still required to be ESWS qualified to take an advancement exam?  You should know they add minerals to water if you paid attention.
54920,Nearly all bottled water in the US goes through RO. It doesn't distill the water.
54921,"source?

my understanding is that most bottled water is essentially tap water. RO is VERY expensive, so I don't see how it would be profitable."
54922,"I've seen both Pepsi and Coke's branded waters (aquafina, dasani respectively) both state (in various places) that they incorporate at least one reverse osmosis step. I suspect that they are just bottling the same feedstock water that they use for soft drink production. While it might be ""expensive,"" they still do it; bottled water is not any cheaper than soft drinks, despite omitting many flavours and carbonation steps.

54923,"Spazmodic has the right idea, look at the labels. It really depends on the brand, to be honest, but the ones that do take what is basically tap water run their water through reverse osmosis."
54924,"Thanks. Out of curiosity, what other things pass through the membrane along with the water? I assume it would be mostly molecules smaller than or similar in size to H2O. Also, what material is used for the membrane in this process?"
54925,"But not in any way desirable. Pure water tastes bad, and lack important nutrients.

54926,"Theres a filter called zero water that claims to remove ALL dissolved solids from water. The water tastes cleaner, but I'd like to know if its actually doing what it says"
54927,Zero Water filters are also a lot bigger. My aunt have their water cooler.
54928,"My dad knows the guy who made these. He brought a few filters last year and I have to admit, it's 10x better than Brita or any other filtered water I've had. 

It comes with a thermometer looking stick that measures the solid density in liquids. Always a 0.00 with a new Zero filter. It almost taste sweet it's so good."
54929,"psi_star_psi: do I know you? we have a few GC-MS and an ICP-OES in this building. anyway on my well water at home, I can see a difference the filter makes at removing rust (brownish water/pipe on one side, clear on the other). However I wouldn't trust any filter to remove e.coli or some such -- only a chemical treatment as far as I'm aware will do that (maybe RO water does it?).

In a well to get rid of e.coli /bacteria you dump bleach down the well, grab a hose and stick it down the well (after it's been hooked up to a sillcock), turn on the hose and let it recirculate. Pretty cool solution if you ask me."
54930,Is there a simple test *I* could do at home?
54931,"All I know is I poured pepsi into a brita filter once, and it came out clear"
54932,"I'm not 100% positive about colas, but Dew gets its coloring from a colloidal suspension that you can even spin out with a microcentrifuge."
54933,"This would be neat to see. 
You must have access to a centrifuge; at least through a third party. Please make a video and upload!"
54934,Need to get myself some mountain dew first.
54935,Not bad!
54936,"Please re-comment here when you dou!

Can you post the results of your previous experiments?"
54937,"Does the filter in my Brita really need to be changed once a month?  Isn't this, (I apologize if i'm using the wrong term) a *mechanical* process?"
54938,"Activated carbon works by adsorption (adhering of molecules to a surface.) Eventually most of the surface area will be covered with the molecules you're trying to filter out, and so you need to replace the filter."
54939,"I would love to know if that "" Zero water"" filtration system is as legit as they claim. I seriously doubt it though."
54940,I have a Bobble water bottle. How about that for a specific test? Please let me know! Greatly appreciated man
54941,"Carbon filters will take out the chlorine in the water, they may also have some multimedia (sand, gravel, etc) in there as well to catch some of the suspended solids in the water as well.

What the filters won't do is 1.) Soften the water (removal of calcium and magnesium) 2.) Filter out TDS (Total Dissolved Solids- minerals, chemicals, etc) or 3.) Deionization/add resisitivity."
54943,"You are using ""coagulant"", do you not ""flocculant""?"
54945,"There is no difference between ""coagulant"" and ""flocculant"". Flocculation is the agglomeration of particles facilitated by mixing, which causes collisions producing enough energy to overcome the repulsive force between two like-charged particles. This is why the closer to the zero-charge point the easier it is to form large flocs (which are not always desirable--such as in dissolved air flotation water treatment plants). Could go on and on about this topic however and if you really need to know more, it's time to pick up Theory and Practice of Water and Wastewater Treatment (Droste, 1997)."
