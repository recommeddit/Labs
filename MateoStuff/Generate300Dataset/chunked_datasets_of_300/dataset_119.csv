37876,"Woah, wtf? Where did that come from lol Did you mean to reply to someone else? Literally not a thing you just said was stated by me. In no way did I say anything like “I’m right you’re all wrong” lol. I think you’re reading non-existent things. 

Oh and what in the world do you mean by “ignoring evidence”? All I said was that when new shit comes out, its immediately called “the best thing in the MCU”. Period. It happens. If you don’t think so then you’re the one “ignoring evidence” because all those posts are still on here. 

The movie was great, I loved it. I just don’t think its “majority have it in their top 5”, especially after a month or when Eternals comes out. Theres no reason for you to start throwing around “arrogant and dense”. That’s completely uncalled for."
37877,"I highly doubt it will be top 5 for many people. Not a knock against it, just there's a ton of great movies and origin stories are slower. I imagine Infinity War, End Game, Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, Iron Man 1, Guardians, and Spiderman will all be ranked higher on the majority of lists.

Again, I loved the movie but no way it's a top 5. Good competition"
37878,"The ending kind of threw off the rest of it for me. I still very much enjoyed the movie but it turned in Godzilla vs Kong the last 15 minutes or so. I get it, they needed to raise the stakes and power scale Shang Chi in a major way as his next appearance will likely be alongside some formidable allies and foes. I bought into the mythical land and creature and thought it was well done, but the “soul sucker” vs Dragon thing is something I think they jumped to too fast."
37879,"Also it’s an origin story tying into a massive universe, something tells me the whole soul sucker dimension portal thing is part of a bigger plot and that was just an introduction"
37880,I haven't seen it yet but my sister has been a much longer Marvel fan and said it's her favorite.
37881,"As a stand alone film I definitely agree, but it's impossible to look past End Game if you factor in the context of it all."
37882,Gotg is still my favourite MCU film...
37883,"Uuuuuuuuh. I'm glad you loved it, dude.  But, that's your opinion. I wouldn't go THAT far I've heard the same stuff since Black Panther. I can a lot of other films that are far superior to Shang-Chi (Infinity War, Guardians 1, Winter Soldier, Black Panther). I'm not saying it's terrible at all, but it does feel like an overreaction. Let's see when Eternals comes out."
37884,I didn’t like the last fight scene.  To me this is somewhere in between ant man 2 and captain marvel
37885,I couldn't agree more. The action presentation alongside D-Box made it so good. Mandarin is definitely the best character with his agressive style.
37886,Glad you enjoy it in D-BOX :)
37887,"Totally agree with everything.
Who's your no.1 villain, because for me it is Wenwu.
Also, Tony Leung should come back for at least a five movie deal with Marvel because I can't get enough of him"
37888,"Xialings KO kick to Shang-Chi after that heart wrenching flashback! I’ve never felt so emotional, empowered and turned on all at once fuck yeah"
37889,I personally think it’s the best marvel movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
37890,"Agree with everything above (just watched on Disney +) and have two more points:

11. No love story- I liked the platonic relationship between the characters and that they didn't need to push anything onto Katy and Shang-Chi, there was enough emotional moments that a relationship would be forced 
12. Karaoke- I mean, who doesn't love karaoke 

Probably my #1 Marvel film at this point, incredible film!"
37891,Best dysney* movie
37892,"Its not, the last 1/3 falls flat.

People were saying the same thing about Black Panther. Both movies are excellent but not the best Marvel films"

37920,"Ragnarok & infinity war best. 
Black panther worst."
37921,"And six of them are from Phase 3

Which goes to show how big of an improvement Phase 3 really is."
37922,"It gets better each phase. I'm on a rewatch of the MCU and just finished Phase 1. They are okay, but really not as great as I remember. It's because we were spoiled by phase 3. I was almost dreading watching The Avengers, maybe I misremembered how great it is. Fortunately, the movie is still just as great as ever, maybe even better after Endgame."
37923,"On my rewatch, I actually liked the earlier films more than I remembered, and I think it's because they are made better because of connections to the later (and better) films. Especially Captain America First Avenger. I was *very* surprised at how well it fit in with Winter Soldier and Civil War when viewed in close proximity with them, even though it had a different director and was set in another era."
37924,"I'm four movies in so far, and the only thing I didn't like was Hulk. I've very much enjoyed the others."
37925,"Different director, same writers.   It helps alot"
37926,Let’s hope we didn’t peak already
37927,"I keep thinking there's no way they can top the current movie (Civil War, Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War, Endgame), and then they keep topping the movie. I almost have to lower my expectations after Endgame, though."
37928,I just finished reaching phase 1 too. Iron Man 2 does not hold up well and I wish they can buy back the movie rights for Hulk back. I forgot about The Leader being hinted and the Abomination.
37929,"Really?  You don’t like Iron Man 2?  It’s my favorite Phase 1 besides Avengers.  It’s the one movie that feels like it really exists in a bigger universe, /plus/ it’s full of a lot of subtle character building and has a lot of likable characters."
37930,Watching Avengers 1 for the first time when i was 9 years old was fucking great.
37931,"Personally I skip out entirely on Phase Two. That phase nearly broke me. Very disappointing compared to the earnest charms of the first phase. Phase 3 felt like they finally got the hang of their formula and went back to the sugar and spice and good director hires that I came to Phase One for, only even more wild and less conservative in tone."
37932,"Even Winter Soldier, Guardians, and Ant-Man?"
37933,"It also had, like, twice as many movies going for it"
37934,"While I agree that phase 3 has the best of the MCU, it's also the biggest phase. 10 of the 22 movies."
37936,"Well it does have way more movies than 1 or 2, but still notably better quality."
37937,Where’s Infinity War?
37938,"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avengers_infinity_war

Avengers: Infinity War got 85% fresh."
37939,"That was the month that 15% of reviewers were evidently under the influence of some kind of reality altering drug, because that score isn't right."
37940,Reality is often disappointing.
37941,Infinity war more than any of the other movies relied on all the other movies to support it. It's good as an in universe film but stand alone I could see someone not liking it.
37942,We could say the same about endgame though
37943,End game has more character development and a defined ending. Infinity war really is part 1 of 2. I think if they said it was part 1 of 2 it would've been better received critically. I think all things considered infinity war is the far better film but if you watch both out of context standalone  then I could see why endgame is more pleasing
37944,"I always hated the argument ""i dosent stand well alone"" . It's not meant to!"
37945,"That's the thing tho. Before the movie came out, in what I can only imagine was an attempt to stop spoilers, they said the movie was not going to be part 1 of 2. It's obviously a two part film but if critics treated it as standalone because that's what the studio told them I have no gripe with them not liking it as much."
37946,"It is not a two-part film. Infinity War and Endgame were written and shot as two separate films with their own narratives. IW is a complete story about Thanos' conquest of the stones, and it ends with his victory. EG is about the heroes' response to his victory. They are two distinct films. It's the whole reason the titles were changed from ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part I and II"". The Russos didn't want people to think it was one movie split into two."
37947,Infinity War and Black Panthers score should be switched.
37948,Infinity War is down at 83% so it didn’t make the cut
37949,"85% not 83%, which is a great score but just not as universally acclaimed as these other movies."
37950,Yeah I agree. I think it’s better than most of the others up there.
37951,I think it has a solid argument for best of the MCU
37952,It was the first Marvel Studios film I saw multiple times in the theater. (3x) Endgame is the only other one (4x and probably going for a 5th).
37953,"My personal ratings aside, I'm really surprised IW has such a low rating compared to Endgame. I'd understand if it was a fan rating, but it shocks me that critics liked Endgame more. Infinity War is a cleaner movie with a tighter plot and I think it stands on its own a lot better than Endgame does. It balanced characters a lot better as well; for as good as Endgame was, it had a lot more problems than a lot of the best Marvel films. Endgame is 3 hours of fan service and payoffs to other films, and from the ratings on other films I would think critics wouldn't like that."
37954,"I think it’s because Endgame has much more depth as a movie than Infinity War. IW is an amazing movie, but it has basically no character development besides Thanos and possibly Gamora. Endgame has a clear theme of our reactions to loss and how we redeem ourselves from that, which is reflected through every Avenger. Infinity War is basically 2 hours of action with emotional moments sprinkled in, which is completely fine because Endgame and Infinity War are meant to balance each other in that. Fan service or not, Endgame has much more heart, which makes you more invested in the movie and the Avengers ultimate triumph."
37955,"IW also tried to juggle so many characters. Sure, it was a Thanos-centered movie, but there wasn't enough focus given to the heroes.

Endgame simply focuses on the OG6 and excels at it."
37956,"> there wasn't enough focus given to the heroes.

Due to having so many characters branching off it also means that some plotlines disappear for a while. Like after Tony and Peter leave earth on the ship they aren't shown for a while so you forget about it. 

The movie also has so much going on that I remember when the rewatch before Endgame happened, a lot of people were surprised (myself included) that Thor arriving at Wakanda was actually before the Titan fight. Not that that really relates to the discussion, but the movie just has so many standout moments from different heroes at different moments at different fights that it lacks the character drama and focus that Endgame."
37957,"That exact thing happens in Endgame too, but instead of following 3 plotlines, you're following 4 or 5 at a time. Endgame is definitely more character focused than Infinity War, but it's still a lot to follow; the second act is significantly more hectic than any part of IW."
37958,85%. Very good score. Just not enough to make top 10.
37959,"Bull that it's not on there, it definitely deserves to be in the top 3."
37960,Low 80’s
37961,There also going off the critics score. I would say use the audience score but that just my opinion.
37962,"Audience score on RT is even less reliable, it’s why they changed their system."
37963,Both scores should be taken lightly. Movies are subjective
37964,"The point is that once enough people give their opinion, it should provide a close estimate. It only doesn’t work when people decide to shit on it for no reason, like emoji movie that was a better than average kids movie."
37965,It can be a good indicator but in the end every single person has different likes. If you want to watch it then watch it.
37966,Let's not count the trolls
37967,Yeah the audience score is way more reliable. Sometimes I feel with rotten tomatoes that they have random movie critics review them and not actual fans of the franchise. Like black panther is good and all but would any true marvel fan have it absolute number one? (Some tru fans  obviously have too but I mean in general)
37968,"Thats because... they do have random critics review them. Critics review ALL movies, not just their interests. Why do you think that Iron Man has way less reviews then Endgame? Endgame is a bigger blockbuster so more critics who dont care about superheros will watch it simply to write a review"
37969,Audience scores on RT are not reliable they're nearly as unreliable as IMDb.
37971,Dude calm down. Plenty of movies with primarily black casts have gotten bad reviews.
37972,"Yes, if you remove the morality, character dynamics, social relevance, plot, sympathy, real-world meaning, and impetus for the art itself, you're left with a bad film. As every film would be.

&#x200B;

Remove the politics from Iron Man and what do you have? Rich guy makes a suit I guess. Snore."
37973,"This is not how Rotten Tomatoes works. If you want to use it to rank the 10 best Marvel Studios movies, you should use the average ratings. This is just percentages of reviewers giving it a 'positive' review."
37974,RT is a most recommended list.
37975,"Winter Soldier is a different type movie, more like a great 1970s spy thriller with occasional superhero’s. It may be the best Marvel movie structurally, I enjoyed it at a different level especially seeing it a second time."
37976,"I agree.  To me, it's still the best movie.  It may not be the best superhero movie, but it's the best movie."
37977,Me as well!! It’s my favorite out of all of them. Glad to see so many people have it as their fave. As much as I love the banter and fun of the others Winter Soldier was just by itself a masterpiece.
37978,I was not prepared at all for WS after The First Avenger. Left that movie with my jaw on the floor.
37979,"It’s at least in the top 3 of MCU movies, and number one of the more serious ones. I laughed more during Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy was fun, but Winter Soldier is something special."
37980,"Seeing it in theatres when it came out was really a jaw-dropping experience. I was a big fan of the MCU before CA:TWS and thought they were great superhero movies, but with this one it was a great superhero movie AND a great movie.

 I really liked CA:TFA and became a big Cap fan from that and from The Avengers, but TWS really dived into Cap's character more. And the fight scenes were phenomenal. I really liked how they were just regular people (albeit supersoldiers, former assassins, or former military) without magic powers fighting each other physically.

Plus I liked Bucky's character a lot in TFA, so seeing him come back in TWS with more complexity to his character was amazing. That reveal at the end of the highway fight scene absolutely floored me."
37981,It was the movie that took marvel from fun superhero niche thing to actual movies that can be talked about in a normal setting.
37982,"Rewatching it right now just for that very reason! It felt like a 70s spy thriller movie but set in the MCU...outta left field, I wanna’ see a hulk horror/thriller. I mean I loved how we got to see professor Hulk and all (MCU does great fan service) but I would love to see some ultimates/old man Logan Hulk. I like the monster. AOU Hulk is my favorite Hulk"
37983,Yeah same
37984,I loved the references to that movie in end game too. That was a treat
37985,Favorite movie everrrr
37986,It’s so tightly written. I loved every moment
37987,The editing was fantastic. I liked that it gave Scarlet some good character moments and introduced the Falcon very naturally into the group.
37988,"Only movie I like Falcon in really, I hate him in Civil War"
37989,"I think this was part of it for me.  Lots of people praise The Dark Knight because the movie is packed full of stuff every minute, nothing feels offhandish or wasted.

Even the comedic parts of TWS are meant to serve a purpose, Cap trying to find his purpose in the world and live a life of normalcy.  I think by AoU he learns that he's not going to have that."
37990,"Anytime something from a movie takes me away from it then it’s like a deduction for me. And with TWS it doesn’t really do that. 

Look at ragnarok for example. There was too much comedy in it although it was written fairly well. It was a dark movie but it was just too cheerful. 

With TWS it all just synced. It’s the first Marvel movie that showed how amazing the films could be. I’ll always give props to the Russos and Markus & McFeely for that"
37991,"Same, it’s my favourite and most rewatchable film in the MCU for me"
37992,"They should have used different (not that much, but still noticeable) genres with every character.  


Instead, they Guardians of the Galaxyfied even Thor Ragnarok (that I love, mind you...but still...)"
37993,Only a second time?  I think I've watched it at least 10 times.
37994,"No other MCU movie has left me with the same ""holy fuck what an intelligent movie"" impression. It has something to say not just about heroism, but it has a topical message about a serious problem in our real-world society. Winter Soldier is the movie that made me really fall in love with Cap."
37995,Capt is far down my list of favourites yet WS is my favourite movie!
37996,I love Black Panther but thinking its better than Endgame is laughable.
37998,I wish more people understood this.
37999,"I wish more people would understand that we do understand, but we also believe that in the aggregate, a binary scoring system is also a valid way to rate a film. Is it the best? Maybe, maybe not, but it is a valid way to measure something."
38000,"If you want to use a binary scoring system to rate movies then fine but that doesn't justify misinterpreting the RT score as rating of a movie's quality. Using the RT score to determine the ""best"" movies is flat out using the system wrong. If every critic in the world gave an Adam Sandler movie 6/10, it would have a 100% score. But if 99% of critics gave a Jordan Peele movie 10/10, and 1% rated it 4/10, it would rank lower than the Sandler comedy. The RT score is very useful for audiences to determine the chance that they'll enjoy a movie but it is certainly not a valid way to measure quality."
38001,people just see BP get any type of positive response and they go into a total meltdown.
38002,Because it's not a movie that deserves the excessive praise it gets.
38003,"Or at least, the said they did."
38004,Their average ratings are 8.31 (Endgame) and 8.27 (Black Panther). There isn’t that much of a discrepancy.
38005,"I disagree but like many other comments here I just want to point out that the Tomatometer is not a score, it’s a percentage of how many critics liked a film vs critics who didn’t"
38006,Black Panther had a bigger audience and many believed it had a large social impact
38007,I know. Everyone in my family wanted to see Black Panther and they’re not Marvel fans at all. It was a fun experience seeing the movie with my Godmother. I just think EG was better tbh. No offense.
38008,Oh I was just explaining a major factor why it did very well. It’s not in my top three but it’s still a good movie.
38010,Well the RT score is how many favored it. Or said it was “fresh.” But yeah I agree with you. It’s a fairly overrated film.
38011,Social impact drives more and more people to see the movie and walk away with an impression.
38012,Yeah you're right . I feel black panther is overrated . There are a lot of movies which are way better than this one . I feel  this movie shouldn't have been nominated for Academy awards as the best picture when clearly there were other movies which were way better than this one . ( Just my personal opinion )
38013,"I completely agree. Black Panther on its own is just a generic action movie. It just has a better written plot than most others in its genre and Killmonger is pretty nuanced for a villain. That being said, the CGI especially at the end is quite bad. I'd be surprised that it was nominated for Best Picture but the Academy Awards are kind of a joke now."
38014,I much preferred Black Panther to Endgame. Didn't hate Endgame or anything but 🤷
38015,*Sorts by Controversial*
38016,You're a bold one.
38017,Alright where's the bastard reviewer who submitted a rotten on the very last day dropping Endgame from 95 to 94?.. Give me his address. Lol. :)
38018,Probably the same one who claimed Dark Phoenix is the best superhero movie of the year.
38019,"Wait, what?"
38020,"Yeah, X-Men fans are out there celebrating a couple of positive early social media reactions (forgetting BvS), one of them being a reporter claiming that DP is the best superhero movie of the year."
38021,"uh.... 
“Best superhero movie of the year” was thrown around for Venom.... and Aquaman..... and..... Deadpool 2.....

Every movie is the “best” it seems"
38022,"Meanwhile Shazam, ""Best superhero movie since a month ago""."
38023,Haha did they really say that? I should totally go check it out. It's the one DC movie that actually seems interesting from the trailer.
38024,"I’m not a fan of the DC movies, but I LOVED Shazam. To me it felt much more like a Marvel movie then a DC movie."
38025,I can’t help thinking he was originally called Captain Marvel when I think of how much like a Marvel movie it is.
38026,https://youtu.be/LAgSdEcRn-Y
38027,Deadpool 2 doesn’t belong in this list...
38029,Every thread that has to do with Rotten Tomatoes.
38030,ITT: people acting like Rotten Tomatoes as a company put out this last and are angry when in reality the percentage is really just the odds someone will think the movie is good
38031,"Dr strange is one of my favorite movies in the MCU, and im glad that it was so well received"
38032,Someone could give me this as their top 10 and I wouldn't really argue with it. Though Doctor Strange over Infinity War is hard to swallow. And I'd have BP around 4 or 5. One of the best movies in the MCU but not top 3.
38033,Ryan coogler us great director.
38034,"This isn't how it works. When you get a metacritic 89, that's an average of 8.9. Percentages on the tomatometer are just the percentage of people who like it, not an average rating. Rotten Tomatoes does have an average rating feature, which I'm fairly sure would give a more agreeable list.

For Example, Doctor Strange got 89%, but an average rating of 7.31, but infinity war got a score of 7.61, so according to Rotten Tomatoes, Infinity War is the better film no? Yet it's nowhere to be seen here but Dr Strange is."
38035,"I'm too late to this thread, so this'll be buried. But this is incorrect and demonstrates how much people do not understand RT. The number is a percentage of how many critics gave the film a positive review, not an indicator of the film's score. If you want to see the actual MCU scores, you need to look at ""Average Rating"", under the ""More Info"" tab. Here are all of the films ranked by average rating:

1. Avengers: Endgame - 8.31/10

2. Black Panther - 8.27/10

3. The Avengers - 8.06/10

4. Guardians of the Galaxy - 7.78/10

5. Iron Man - 7.71/10

6. Captain America: Civil War - 7.7/10

7. Spider-Man: Homecoming - 7.65/10

8. Avengers: Infinity War - 7.61/10

9. Captain America: The Winter Soldier - 7.61/10

10. Thor: Ragnarok - 7.54/10

11. Doctor Strange - 7.31/10

12. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - 7.25/10

13. Iron Man 3 - 6.98/10

14. Ant-Man and the Wasp - 6.97/10

15. Captain America: The First Avenger - 6.96/10

16. Ant-Man - 6.86/10

17. Captain Marvel - 6.79/10

18. Avengers: Age of Ultron - 6.74/10

19. Thor - 6.72/10

20. Iron Man 2 - 6.47/10

21. Thor: The Dark World - 6.22/10

22. The Incredible Hulk - 6.17/10"
38036,"ITT: ""DAE BLACK OVERRATED??1"""
38037,"Black panther isn't bad or anything, it's just not as great as people say it is...
People only think so highly of it because it made a political statement."
38038,"This is a guage of how many Critics said it was fresh, not it's overall rating. I would give almost every MCU film a positive rating including BP, but it's not my fav."
38039,"Same,
When is said ' it's not as good as people say it is'
I meant in comparison to the other MCU movies"
38040,"I wouldn’t call it the best marvel movie, but is easily a top 5 for me"
38041,"I'm putting it at like top 8 or 9ish. It's good, but I have a hard time putting it above Endgame, Infinity War, Avengers 1, Civil War, Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ragnarok or GotG1."
38043,I loved basically everything about the movie EXCEPT Black Panther. I felt like he didn’t go through a lot of struggles compared to other superheroes and kinda downplayed him tbh.
38044,His struggle kind of happened in Civil War I guess. I was way more interested in his character in that movie.
38045,"That's a perfectly valid reason to like a movie.
I enjoyed it because it was the first marvel movie where the bad guy wasn't a mustache-twirler. I still think Killmonger was the bad guy, and he wasn't perfectly written, but it was refreshing to see someone other than ""we're hydra and we want to rule the world!"" or some of the other, more cartoony villains of phase 1 (with Ultron maybe being the worst).

Plus the soundtrack for Black Panther is legitimately amazing."
38046,Killmonger was more of a mustache twirler than most of the MCU... Literally wants to send Wakanda tech out to overthrow the world.
38047,"He wants to use Wakanda tech to reverse centuries of oppression that's still in many ways happening--he sees race as determinative (as many supremacists do) and insists on his group being the winner.

I mean, it's clearly a comic book take on race relations, but there are parallels between the MLK-style approach to race and the more militant, Black Panther-style approach. It's hard to look at pictures of slaves or Emmitt Till or hundreds of others without at least feeling some empathy for that mindset, even if it's ultimately destructive."
38048,"I never said he didn't have good reasons. I liked Killmonger a lot, right up to the end when we find out his grand plan all along was to create world anarchy and he put on the copycat cgi suit. He got real boring real fast for me."
38049,"Ah, to me a mustache twirler is someone who just wants to be evil because, like, they just want to. Maybe I'll have to watch it again, but man, you can't deny he has the best final line of any marvel villain."
38050,"Ah I got you, sorry, I read more into the take over the world line. I loved him for the first 2/3s and then the last minute. He's still one of the better villains, but he could have been probably second to Thanos if they had done the third act better."
38051,"Outside of Thanos and Killmonger, what do you think are some good MCU villains? I liked Loki but I don't know if he counts. Hela was o.k., but mostly visually--her storyline didn't do a lot for me."
38052,"Thanos, Zemo, Vulture, Loki, Taserface… in that order."
38053,"Thank you. Yes, exactly. It’s a decent movie. Definitely not the greatest.  I would consider it in the top 10, not top 5."
38054,And this is why Rotten Tomatoes should not be trusted...
38055,"Rotten Tomatoes is just a score aggregator, and their scoring system is a lot more flat than other weighted systems, like Metacritic.

The problem is that the Rotten/Fresh percentage is derived from a binary good/bad interpretation of a review. The reviews themselves aren't usually binary, but on 5-point or 10-point scales.

The result is middling reviews get normalized to either ""good"" or ""bad"", and the weight of a more nuanced opinion is lost in the wash of ""thing bad"" or ""thing good"".

They include the actual average rating normalized to a 10-point scale, but that's usually a smaller, less noticeable number."
38057,Vol. 2 is very underrated. It complements Vol. 1 very well.
38058,i knew most of the responses would focus mostly on BP being listed. Get over it.
38059,"For real. First, RT isn't saying it's a better movie. Just that more critics liked it. Second, it doesn't matter - there are a LOT of possible permutations of an MCU top 10 list, everyone on this sub could theoretically have a unique list. This is just one. And it's not even by a person. Lastly, the animosity towards BP is revealing."
38060,"Yeah, it really is telling. No MCU movie gets criticised this much to the point that if you praise it, you get downvoted. But oh well, hopefully one day they'll get over it..... Maybe not. It's actually funny to see people get all upset about this. I love it."
38061,"You should be showing the average rating, that’s a better way to compare them."
38062,This is similar to my top ten just not in the same order
38063,"this is actually wrong, percentage of positive reviews has nothing to do with how good a movie is, it should be sorted by average critic rating, or just metacrtic score  
like you can have a movie with 100% on RT but all could be 6/10s would you consider that movie better than one with 400 9-10 and 8 4/10 would put it on 98%"
38064,"ITT: People still bitching about Black Panther, get the fuck over it. It's been over a year now."
38065,"There is so much wrong with this that I don't even know where to start. I mean, I'm not saying my opinion is better than any else's, but I mean, what even is this monstrosity? So many questions. How does Infinity War not make it into top 10? How is Winter Soldier at 9? How is Black Panther at the top? And those are just the the big ones..."
38066,I like Homecoming better than ragnarak dont @ me
38067,"Once I saw Black Panther at #1 I stopped looking at the rest.  It's a good, socially important movie.  But it's really not a great movie.  I wouldn't put it in the top 5 MCU movies."
38068,I mean to be fair this isn’t really a true top ten list. All rotten tomato rankings mean are what percentage of the critics would recommend the movie. Not even the website itself tries to claim that it’s a true indicator of quality. The ranking does have some worth but it heavily varies based on the individual.
38069,hurt your feelings to see that huh.
38070,Yes.  I ugly cried.
38071,"Woo, right on cue BP's success brings out people's insecurities."
38072,"Baffles me seeing Black Panther up there at 1. It’s my second to last out of the MCU. But it’s all subjective, I know I’m in the minority and a lot of people love it."
38073,"You rate Thor 1 or 2 higher? 

Yeah, i dont trust your judgment."
38074,"I like Thor 1 more than Black Panther. I thought it was a really fun movie that did a good job introducing the general audience to Asgard, something that is very hard to do. Plus it gave us Hemsworth’s Thor, Hiddleston’s Loki, and Hopkins’ Odin who are all fantastic. Thor 2 is my least favorite MCU film."
38075,"Dude, Asgard is so paper thin in Thor 1. It is barely fleshed out."
38076,"Not gonna lie, bro...

&#x200B;

but people have like...

&#x200B;

opinions.

&#x200B;

Yeah, and sometimes they're different.

&#x200B;

Crazy.

&#x200B;

Personally I love Thor 1 and Black Panther and see them as structurally similar. The MCU has been returning to phase one films for structure for awhile. They used Iron Man a lot, and in my opinion that wasn't very successful - it gave us Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, which were kinda flaccid without RDJ's charm and the political commentary of the original. THOR's structure, however, has proven more versatile. It's given us Black Panther, Ragnarok, and Captain Marvel, which I enjoyed far more. There's more room to play with it, too."
38077,"Out of curiosity, what didn’t you like about it?"
38078,"I just felt that it was a story we’ve seen over and over again, I found Black Panther himself to be really boring every time he was on screen, also the whole pretending he was dead thing was 30 minutes of wasted screen time and a really dumb narrative choice. I thought most of the action was poorly shot, and probably the biggest of all, the 3rd act is a mess of truly bad special effects. I loved Black Panther in Civil War, I thought he was so awesome but his solo movie was was just disappointing. I even went back to the theater a second time after not liking it just to see if I was crazy for not thinking it was all that good like everyone was saying and ended up walking out still very lukewarm on it."
38079,Rearrange the order a bit and switch out Dr Strange for Infinity War and it's the same as my list.
38080,"Pretty close to my own rankings, actually. Except no  Guardians 2 which is one of my top 3 for sure."
38081,I thought GotG was going to be trash but I really enjoyed it.
38082,I'm a little offended Infinity War isn't on this list.
38083,Why is Ragnarok so high?
38084,"I'm sorry, but Black Panther is not that good. No way is it better than Endgame. And Infinity War isn't even on the list?"
38085,The Winter Soldier should be higher up on the ranks
38086,"I never liked RT's rating system (seriously, Black Panther is #1 and Infinity War isn't even in the top 10...)

I find IMDb's ratings much more accurate:

Avengers: Endgame - 8.8

Avengers: Infinity War - 8.5

The Avengers - 8.1

Guardians of the Galaxy - 8.1

Iron Man - 7.9

Thor: Ragnarok - 7.9

Captain America: Civil War - 7.8

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - 7.8

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - 7.7

Spider-Man: Homecoming - 7.5"
38087,"Black Panther being #1 is a fucking joke. It's not even top 5 for me, probably not even top 10."
38088,"Infinity War is a much better movie than End Game, change my mind."
38090,"Because it doesnt rely on watching a whole bunch of marvel movies, making it more open to critics?"
38091,"Yeah, just like we know why most don't like it...."
38092,You’ve gotta be kidding BP in #1?
38093,"People love to focus on Black Panther. Really says alot.

EDIT:
>""Black Panther is overrated and only praised cause it has black characters"" 

People didn't like the fact it won awards compared to others or whatever, but the way that people act whenever the movie is brought up is just revealing to say the least.

To put it bluntly, it feels like racism but isn't (or atleast it is a tad bit close to it). Black Panther had problems, and you don't have to like it, but if the movie is praised in the slightest someone has to chime in on how it is overrated or try to say it is only popular due to political reasons.

No one does that here with Doctor Strange (random example). 

Black Panther had many great things about it, but it seems people want to undermine all of that, and the hate around it doesn't make much sense. 

But I don't think you have to be a genius to get what i'm saying."
38094,"Black panther is good but gimme Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier as the top 3."
38095,The only issue I have with this is BP being #1 and no IW. I’d put BP in the 5-10 range and put IW in top 5. Not sure which movie I’d drop for IW though.
38096,"Black Panther was WAY overhyped. Sure it’s great in many ways, but it doesn’t have much rewatchability and those other movies (except Doctor Strange maybe) are all better."
38097,"This makes me sad. BP was good, but not even close to the best MCU movie"
38098,Why does that make you sad?
38099,Do you even know how RT works?
38100,"a lot of people in here don't. they just see BP in a high position and go into meltdown without even reading. Ignorance at its finest, but i am not surprised."
38101,"awww, go get some tissue."
38102,"Infinity War, Endgame, Raknarok, Iron Man, Civil War, Winter Soldier, GOTG, Homecoming, Avengers, and a tie for basically whatever because the rest are kind of similar in many ways. Standard formula stuff. I think I liked Ant-Man more than most people. I'd probably put that above Black Panther and maybe Doctor Strange just because it's a quirky sort of intro instead of boilerplate like BP. Ant-Man and Wasp on the other hand is near the bottom with Thor and stuff."
38103,Lmao black panther is better than endgame? Bruh that's just not true
38104,"I can quibble with this or that, but Dr. Strange better than Infinity War?"
38105,"I'll quibble over order, but as far as selection, I have no major complaints.  

If I was to make and selection changes, I'd swap Infinity War for Dr. Strange."
38106,I don't care about ratings but according to Rotten tomatoes Black panther is a better movie than Goodfellas.
38107,"This is pretty much my top. Idk why but I super hated infinity war. I’ve watched it a few times and I just felt like the pacing was poor and it felt so disorganized. I get why a lot of people like it but honestly I would probably put it in the middle at best. We all have different reasons why we like them and don’t like them, I guess."
38108,My personal rankings would have these ten in a different order but replace Spidey with IW.
38109,Winter soldier and black panther should swap positions..
38110,No IW? What a joke
38111,I’m this got me thinking... what happens when the Sony deal is over? Does he leave the mcu like he never existed?
38112,The lack of infinity war and guardians 2 instead of Endgame and maybe Strange is kinda disturbing.
38113,"Black Panther and Dr Strange are overrated but other than that, pretty spot on"
38114,Winter Soldier came out at a time when reviewers were still afraid to give comic book movies 5 star reviews
38115,"Just in case you want input from the much more skeptical POV (i.e. I generally hate these films), to me the good ones are Iron Man, The Avengers and Thor: Ragnarok."
38116,"Respectable. Did you see Guardains? If you liked Ragnarok, my guess is you'd like Guardians, but maybe not."
38117,"Admittedly I did have fun for most of it but by the time it climaxed with >!that third-rate-network-sitcom-level ""dance-off"" moment and then some purple CGI goop!< I was like ""How did they trick me into paying to see this?"" But I heard on the commentaries how about much Griffin and David revel in these films so it's not like I think anyone who likes them is an idiot."
38118,"Also, everyone keeps talking about the boys liking MCU movies. Did they go through the entire MCU on Patreon? I'm not a member because I'm poor, but I may have to shell out if they're covering Marvel."
38119,"Yep, the first series of the patreon was the MCU in its entirety from Iron Man to Spider-Man: Far From Home. They’re all fun listens! Especially the ones where I felt I had a different opinion on the movies."
38120,"Oh yes, that was their whole first year of commentaries - from Iron Man to Far from Home! And now that they’re done, you can go grab 50+ hours of content you’ll enjoy for just $5..."
38121,"FYI, you can become a patron for a month for $5, download everything they've done so far, then opt out and listen to it all in your own time. That's currently 23 commentaries for the MCU, 8 for Star Wars and one for Toy Story (if you do it next month, you get all four Toy Story commentaries as well). Plus all the bonus episodes, of course."
38122,Hahahahaha I loved your description of the climax.
38123,"The best ones IMO are Iron Man 1, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 and 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Spiderman: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.

My real opinion is just watch them all. Treat it like a TV show if you need to and do an hour at a time. Watching them all is the one true Marvel experience.

Except Hulk, like /u/ThoroughHenry said. Hulk sucks, it doesn't feel like part of the franchise, and Edward Norton was recast anyway.

Edit: Add Black Panther, which I can't believe I forgot. That's a real good blankie movie. Set designs and costumes are AMAZING, as is Michael B. Jordan's performance."
38124,"I'm  huge MCU fan and have seen all the movies multiple times, even the stinkers. I'd highly recommend the following curated list in this particular order. I basically tried to give you the cream of the crop while also condensing the giant storyllne from 23 films down to 8. I actually think this flows quite nicely and, if I'm correct, I don't think there will even be any plotholes. From Iron Man to Avengers, it skips four films, but those four films are pretty much summarized in the exposition during the opening fifteen minutes of Avengers. Captain America: Winter Soldier skips ahead a couple of films, but you aren't missing anything. You then take a break from the main storyline for a b-story with Guardians of the Galaxy: new characters, new world, but it's worth it because it's one of the better crafted films and you'll need it for when you get to Infinity War and Endgame. Civil War picks up the main story immediately where you left off in Winter Soldier. Thor: Ragnarok takes you up to speed with what has been going on with Thor in another galaxy and that film ends in a cliffhanger that picks up directly in Infinity War. Infinity War and Endgame serve as Part I and Part II of the epic conclusion. You will need Netflix for Infinity War, but everything else is available on Disney Plus.

I'm actually glad you asked for this and am proud of my abridged adaptation. Not only does the story flow well with these, but I also think these are the best films! I think i'm going to watch along with you in this order should you decide to take me up on it!

1. Iron Man
2. The Avengers
3. Captain America: Winter Soldier
4. Guardians of the Galaxy
5. Captain America: Civil War
6. Thor: Ragnarok
7. Avengers: Infinity War
8. Avengers: Endgame"
38125,"I’m kinda surprised to see Age of Ultron omitted! It’s a good curated list otherwise, all of the movies you listed are indeed essential to the overall story."
38126,"Thanks! Yeah, there seems to be a lot of people in this thread that enjoy Ultron. I can't say I'm one of them haha. To me, Ultron was always the worst Avengers movie and I don't feel there's anything you're missing storywise without it except for maybe the introduction of some new characters which are easily explained during the exposition in Civil War."
38127,"I’m one of those who really enjoys Ultron and thinks it got a little underrated (still wish we could get the more pure Whedon version), but there are some important story threads in there that are important.

Not only do you have two of the stones, there are a lot of call backs related to Tony’s (character) arc, Sokovia, Hulk, etc. Not to mention the excellent payoff for Hawkeye’s farm that comes in the opening of Endgame. It’s messy but unskippable in my humble opinion."
38128,Only Iron Man 3 but the Guardians movies are fun too.
38129,I love that you appreciate Iron Man 3. It's severely underrated.
38130,This is the right answer.
38131,"As a big Marvel fan, I think all of them are worth watching except Incredible Hulk. Beyond that it comes down to preference. A lot of people don’t like the first two Thor movies, I don’t like the Ant-man movies much, but pretty much all of them have good qualities and contribute something important to the overall narrative arc."
38132,"Depends on what you want and how much time you want to spend!

For an abridged version of the main storyline, I would recommend:

Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. And you could probably skip The Dark World and Doctor Strange if you wanted.

For just my personal recommends of the most fun/best of the series:

Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man Three, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War.  Would include Endgame but the enjoyment of that really comes from watching most if not all of the series. 

David and Griffin are big fans (relative to most) of Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man Three, and Guardians Vol. 2, so those are just fun eps"
38133,"Well, if you're watching for the commentaries, they're all great. Movies themselves, I don't know. I think they're all pretty watchable, but I don't know if that's enough for you. 

You probably will forget ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Captain Marvel"" and the first two ""Thor"" movies immediately after finishing them, but they're still fun as you're watching them. 

""Avengers"" is kind of a perfect action movie. 

The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films are the ones with the most distinct style. 

People will swear that ""Black Panther"" and ""Iron Man 3"" are the ones that are truly great, and you might agree, but to me they're good in the exact same way the other ones are."
38134,I should emphasize that I recommend listening to all the commentaries because the go over a lot about the arc of the MCU and how each movie changed people's expectations. Plus Ben's reaction to seeing them for the first time.
38135,"obviously mileage will vary BUT these are the ones that I, personally, would think of as categorically good flicks on their own:

Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Guardians of the Galaxy, 
Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther

i also love Age of Ultron but it is kind of a mess. Every other Marvel movie i have basically zero interest in rewatching most of the time. Infinity War and Endgame are ok but you have to have seen at least 80% of the MCU already to fully buy into it. (also Winter Soldier is extremely well-loved but it’s just not my thing i guess)"
38136,Individually the marvel films are generally just good movies. However they are greater than the sum of their parts. You should watch all of them in order. You’ll enjoy the later ones a lot more having watched the earlier ones.
38137,"Captain America: The  First Avenger is a top-tier commentary, because in includes a Touch of the Tucce, and Tommy Lee Jones rocking the house."
38138,"Oh ho ho, you're a sneaky one u/timnuoa. You ALMOST tricked me into sharing a Marvel opinion online. But NOT TODAY, MY FRIEND.

What's next? You'll have never heard of these ""Star"" ""Wars""? I ain't fallin' for it, buddy!"
38139,"the ones I'm ride or die for are Captain Marvel, Age of Ultron, IM3, Black Panther, Avengers and the first Captain America

and I also like Thor: The Dark World, the Ant-Men, first Guardians and the first Iron Man"
38140,"What is it about Captain Marvel that puts it in your top tier list? The other ones you listed are mostly divisive, but they all took big swings and are real ""love it or hate it"" flicks. I liked Captain Marvel fine, I'm looking forward to seeing where the character goes, but to me the movie was very safe and ""generic Marvel""."
38141,"I gotta say, Captain Marvel is probably one of the worst art-directed movies I’ve ever seen considering the budget and means these movies have.

Alien city? Basically just some glowy vague buildings, a train and a big empty fighting room

Then the next third of the movie is set in a generic facility

Then the third act is in a swampy field and then a desert field

Also Jude Law’s makeup is super boring and Ben Mendelssohn looks like he’s wearing a big rubber mask. Just absolutely the cheapest looking MCU movie"
38142,"Carol's my fav comic book character and has been for like the past 5 years. Even since Ultron, I've never felt the movies have foregrounded these characters' personal lives and the tragedy of those being lost because of how responsibility they take on -- partly because Whedon stopped having a hand in things, partly because they suddenly realised they had like 3 years until IW and hadn't done enough of the groundwork in setting that up sufficiently -- and this goes a step further. It's about someone who has their sense of being, their autonomy taken away and reclaims that through the course of the movie. Carol gets to choose who she wants to be.

And Boden & Fleck afford Brie so much space to give a human performance, the fact this movie has the time for the sequence in Louisiana is wonderful, the quietness of it all that gets all shaken up by the black box recording revealing the truth and her ""I don't even know who I am"" feels so big as a result."
38143,"I gotta say... I'm super confused as to why people are coming down so hard on Captain Marvel when you listed Ultron and Dark World. Dark World is, I think, the worst film in the entire MCU and Ultron is not far behind to me."
38144,"Have you seen Hulk lately? I did a complete rewatch last year when I got onto the Patreon and I could not believe how piss-poor Hulk was. It really does not come across as a quality movie in any way. Dark World and Ultron have plenty of good parts. Hulk genuinely doesn't, IMO."
38145,"I rank Dark World as the worst, Hulk as runner-up to the worst, and then Ant-Man and the Wasp, and then Ultron..."
38146,"Cool cool, just didn't know if you were counting Hulk in there. You are, so fine.

^(I mean that's totally insane to me but arguing on the Internet is dumb.)"
38147,Hahaha. Arguing on the internet is the only thing passing the time for me in lockdown. I mean as long as people realize we're arguing on the internet and remain respectful which you're clearly being. I like people that feel passionately about movies even if they disagree. And the important thing to remember is that we can all agree on one simple truth: Hulk sucks. (Just his standalone movie. I enjoy Ruffalo much more especially in Ragnarok and Endgame.)
38148,"Yes, Hulk the movie sucks. Hulk the character is great, as is Mark Ruffalo. I like him better than Norton, both in his early ""tortured soul super-genius"" mode and his later ""vaguely stonery comic relief"" style.

I went to SD Comic-Con in 2007, went to the Hall H presentation with RDJ and Ed Norton and Gwyneth Paltrow and I guess Kevin Feige was probably there although I had no idea who he was then.

At one point, someone asked Norton what his involvement behind the scenes of the movie was. He did a cute little ""aw shucks"" move, looked down at his shoes, and literally said ""I wrote the movie"". That is a direct quote, and I have not forgiven him for it."
38149,"That is a really good story. Also crazy that you were there for that... Because I remember when Iron Man came out. It was the summer in between my junior and senior year of high school. All of my friends and I stayed after the credits for the cut scene with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and then we talked about how one of us had read in a magazine (those were in '08) how there was going to be a film or two every summer until they all converged in like 2012 or 2013... Back then, it was unheard of. And the fact that you were at Hall H is pretty wild. 

Also, I worked in the film industry for a couple of years and met a lot of people. Never met Norton, but know many friends that have. He's apparently a huge dick. He and Cumberbatch (who I have met) are notoriously the worst to work for/with. Apparently Norton was never happy with the studio or the script. He rewrote the whole thing which is just bizarre because he's not a good writer."
38150,I like Captain Marvel because it's fun to watch Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson hang out. The Dark World is un-fun sludge.
38151,Amen to that!!
38152,"Good take! Especially about letting the movie slow down. You're right, it's like if the farmhouse sequence in Ultron was allowed to last more than a few minutes."
38153,"\*\*the ones I'm ride or die for are IM3, Black Panther, Avengers and the first Captain America

and I also like the Ant-Men, first Guardians and the first Iron Man

You had some typos. Fixed it for you."
38154,"How many do you want to watch? If you only want to watch one I think Iron Man, Guardians of Galaxy, and Ant-Man work best as stand-alone films. Not to say they are the best films. 

If you want to just want to watch the good ones: Captian America Winter Soldier, Iron Man,  Captin America First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Guardians of Galaxy (1 &2), Ant-Man (1 & 2), The Avengers and Black Panther.  Everything else is ok to bad in my humble opinion."
38155,"Watch Iron Man, watch the first Avengers, then you can basically fill in the plot details live as you listen to the podcast and just imagine the same visual language, music, acting, writing, etc from those two.

If you haven't watched Hulk for the Ang Lee series yet watch that as well as it's something different."
38156,What’s nice about MCU movies that they REALLY stick to a strict three-act structure. So you can put any of them on for 40 minutes at a time and sort of get a nice little dose of MCU: The TV Show
38157,"Iron Man

Captain America: The First Avenger

The Avengers

Iron Man Three

Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Guardians of the Galaxy

Captain America: Civil War

Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2

Black Panther

Avengers: Endgame* (you’ll have to watch Avengers: Infinity War for context which I don’t think is great and is pretty long so idk)"
38158,Wait. What? You think Endgame is better than Infinty War? Infinity War is the Episode V of the saga!
38159,"Infinity War is barely a movie, just cgi action scenes and quips for 2.5 hours. At least Endgame has some real emotion in it"
38160,"Just replying to throw some support behind this take. *Infinity War* is an extended best of showreel with no substance. I like *Endgame*, which actually dares to be fun and somewhat meaningful."
38161,"It's really interesting that you think that, because the majority of fans and critics alike agree that Infinity War is the superior film. It has better pacing, a better blend of action and story, and is more self-contained than Endgame. Since Endgame serves as a soft conclusion to the entire MCU it is tying up so many loose threads whereas Infinity War had room to breathe and is a better standalone movie. What I find most interesting is that your main critique is that it is nothing but quips and Endgame threw away much of the character arcs to instead make them caricatures. Out of the main characters presented in Endgame, Iron Man, Ant Man, Rocket, Hulk, and Thor served as comic relief. 

Infinity War is also a remarkably focused film considering how many characters' storylines had to converge at the same time. We see the culmination of Tony Stark’s fears of a threat too great for him to handle, Thor finally fighting back after losing everything dear to him, and Captain America’s refusal to “trade lives,” and it’s all told through the lens of Thanos’ quest to collect the Infinity Stones.  With Thanos’s early death, a meandering time jump, and the haphazard “Time Heist” that drags out the second act, *Endgame* is far less focused and sharp than its predecessor. 

Infinity War also has a far less muddled plot. It sees the Avengers split into three distinct groups across the cosmos, with their scenes structured around Thanos’ quest to collect the Infinity Stones. The geography and timeline all make perfect sense, which is astounding for an epic of this scale. Endgame on the other hand has a muddled plot that leaves the audience scratching its heads for half of it because, thanks to Marvel’s reshoots, there are two sets of time travel rules established in the film.

I'd very much like to hear your rebuttal if you can! I'm so bored in lockdown that arguing about movies is nice distraction for me! Also, can any Blankies back me up? Am I crazy? Who do you agree with?"
38162,"I adore Endgame. The first hour makes you feel the weight of what happened in Infinity War. The second hour is literally called a ""time heist"" which should earn it a Pulitzer alone. And the third hour gave me the most goosebumps a film may have ever given me. It's not perfect, obviously, but maybe the most satisfying time I've ever had in a movie theatre."
38163,"I agree. I'm not a huge MCU fan, but the portals at the end (I don't think that's a spoiler) was the most goosebumps moment I've ever had in a theater."
38164,"I like Endgame a lot! I also remember enjoying the experience in the theater more than Infinity War. It did a great job with the payoff all us fans had been waiting on for sure! Especially when Captain America wielded Mjolnir! I just think Infinity War compared to Endgame overall is a superior film due to pacing, character arcs, story, etc."
38165,give Steven Moffat the Pulitzer first: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_Heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Heist)
38166,"I agree with u/Ace7of7Spades here.  *Infinity War* doesn't work.  Sure the characters break into manageable teams, but there really isn't any through line to the narratives.  The movie is a bunch of cgi action scenes stacked in a trench coat acting like it's a movie.  

The ""Thanos is the protagonist"" narrative doesn't really work for me either.  When I watched the movie the first time I was baffled by the lack of structure, but bought into that Thanos narrative and was ready to engage with it watching the movie again before *Endgame*.  I just don't see it.  It seems like an excuse to wipe away the lack of any of the other characters working in the movie.  Just because the audience is expected to know all the backstory of the other character (which barely follows through movie to movie) doesn't mean that there should be nothing that I am able to hold on to through *Infinity War*.

EDIT: And how does *Infinity War*'s pacing work in your opinion?  Fast bouncing around =/= good."
38167,"Lol thank you for doing all the heavy lifting.

The other problem with *Infinity War* is just that the ending means nothing. Everyone knows that Black Panther isn’t fuckin dead. *Endgame* gets all the credit for doing anything interesting with *Infinity War*’s ending. 

Having the first hour be so reflective on their failure and Thanos’s early fate are **legitimately** surprising, while the ending of *Infinity War* does nothing but have people go “oh boy can’t wait to see how they reverse this”"
38168,"That makes sense. It's weird because I originally thought Endgame was better than Infinity War upon initial viewing. I've already said in this thread, but the movie going experience was far superior for Endgame, but then when I re-examined both movies during the holiday, i just felt that everything Endgame did, Infinity War did better. Guess I'm the minority amongst this group."
38169,"Love Infinity War! This isn’t the sole reason but to keep it brief, I was completely shocked by the ending as I think most were. I don’t agree with “we know they’re not really dead” as a criticism because the characters don’t know that! And in the interim before Endgame came out, I could actually kinda see (like 10% possible) how every character that vanished was either replaceable or wouldn’t really be missed. 

And if nothing else, it feels like a $300 million production of kids smashing their superhero action figures together"
38170,"Yeah, it's definitely the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel and I'm shocked the people in this thread are arguing otherwise (but I'm enjoying the argument and human contact albeit virtual... Wow, quarantine is rough.)"
38171,"Well I love this sub cause it’s the rare place we can civilly disagree. And I totally get most people’s dislike of MCU in general, I’m just in the bag for these so paying $20 to watch Thor make a hammer and RDJ be covered in a CGI suit is a fun time for me. Totally get it’s not everyone’s thing."
38172,Definitely!
38173,"> I don’t agree with “we know they’re not really dead” as a criticism because the characters don’t know that!

Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. When Black Panther makes over a billion dollars and then dies in the next movie, it's just impossible to take seriously. When Bucky and Wanda were dusted, I was shocked and fully bought in. But then T'Challah vanished and I thought, ""Never mind, this will all be undone somehow."""
38174,"Lol not to mention fucking Spider-man whose new movie was ALREADY ANNOUNCED

They weren’t even trying to sell it straight"
38175,"That was my first reaction too so I get it and if Endgame didn’t focus on it, I’d totally agree but they make you and the characters sit with it. And this is probably just me but I could see the sliver of possibility that Nakia/Okoye/M’Baku become BP and they make Miles Spider-Man.  Not saying likely, but I could see it. Because frankly I hate that we know all this behind the scenes crap and dont want to hold that against a movie that again, shocked me when it ended!"
38176,"> majority of fans and critics alike agree that Infinity War is the superior film

Evidence?"
38177,"I mean... Is your Google broken? It's one simple search, but I guess I'll just copy and paste for you. Haha. Here: 

https://www.google.com/search?q=which+is+better+infinity+war+or+endgame&oq=which+is+better&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l6.4518j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

If you search ""Which is better Infinity War or Endgame,""on the front page (without clicking next), there are 8 result articles... 6/8 lay out what I think is solid reasoning how Infinity War is superior. So that is 75% of op-ed pieces by both fans and critics because some are from reputable publications and others are things like Reddit. To me, it is the Episode V of the MCU. 

HOWEVER, inconsistent to that, I found that on Rotten Tomatoes, Endgame edges out Infinity War with 93% over 84% and then the audience score is basically the same for each although Infinity War is barely ahead by a slight margin so I find that pretty interesting... Infinity War shows a ten point spread over Endgame on Metacritic though and also edges out the IMDB score by a margin... So out of 4 things: Rotten Tomatoes, the audience score for RT, IMDB, and Metacritic, Infinty War is ahead in 3/4. 75% again... At least I'm able to show my work! Hahahaha"
38178,"u/pacoismynickname Did this evidence suffice? I was wondering what your response would be considering your ""evidence?"" comment seemed condescending. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but it seemed like you were implying I had no ground to stand on. Guess you weren't expecting so much to back up my claim, huh? haha"
38179,"On RT I only pay attention to the Top Critics score. Endgame wins 93% to 74%. You have Metacritic wrong: Endgame has 78, Infinity War 68. It's clear critics preferred Endgame.

Audience scores on websites are based on self-selected samples and mean nothing. On CinemaScore, a professionally administered survey, Endgame received an A+ to Infinity War's A. Dollars are another form of voting. Endgame wins that one easily, too.

This is pretty open & shut."
