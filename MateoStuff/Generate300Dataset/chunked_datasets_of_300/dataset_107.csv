34132,What the hell man. &#3232;\_&#3232;
34133,"Without a doubt the GOAT, is Jerry Rice. I fully believe that both Joe Montana and Steve Young would not be half as respected as they are if they weren't throwing the ball to Rice. 

He shattered so many records in a time when the league was no where near as protective or pass happy as they are today. And he did it with largely inferior physical talent, but just with a knowledge of the game and a unquenchable work ethic."
34134,"While Jerry Rice was one of the greatest players and definitely the best WR of all-time, Joe Montana won two Super Bowls without him."
34135,"Sammy Baugh. 

But also Jim Brown, Jerry Rice, and Lawrence Taylor are right in there. 

(Rex Grossman isn't done yet)."
34136,Let's go TCU Horned Frogs.
34137,"NFL network has a Top 100 players series. If I remember correctly, it was Jerry Rice, Jim Brown, Lawrence Taylor, Joe Montana and ~~Dick Butkus~~ Walter Payton.

Can't disagree really."
34138,Payton is in their Top 5 somewhere.
34139,You're right. Payton was number five. [Here's](http://top100.nfl.com/all-time-100) the official list.
34140,"Most dominant player in their era? Don Hutson

Most complete/versatile player? Many would probably say Walter Payton, although I think Sammy Baugh was better who actually played in all 3 phases throughout his career.

Best athlete? Probably Randy Moss, but that doesn't mean it always translated on the field.

I'm going with Sammy Baugh. There was also the season where he led the league in passing, punting and interceptions in the same season."
34141,"Randy Moss has every single physical you would want in a WR: he's tall, he's fast, he can jump, and he has amazing hands. Plus when you watched him play (while he was trying) it was like watching ballet. He was so graceful it was incredible. When he was sprinting it was like he was almost gliding. It's purely his own fault that he will not go down as the greatest WR of all time."
34142,"I'm glad you brought up Hutson. I realize Rice is always considered the best receiver/player of all time, but Hutson was so dominant for his time and essentially created the modern receiver position as we know it. Plus he still holds the record for most seasons and most consecutive seasons leading the league in receptions, yards, and touchdowns. Records I dare say that will never be broken."
34143,"Let's be fair, Hutson broke those records in the early 40's when most of his potential competition was fighting the Axis powers."
34144,"Nope. Hutson played 7 seasons before the US entered WWII. He led the league in receptions four times, yards four times, and touchdowns six times.

He was getting more receiving touchdowns than entire other teams, and he was doing it at a time when teams couldn't even complete 40% of their passes."
34145,"Haha you might want to direct this towards TracyMorganFreeman, I was not the one to mention Hutson."
34146,True. My bad. Reddit is always harder for me on my phone.
34147,it's all good homie
34149,"He wasn't really a deep threat as he wasn't very fast. He was a homerun threat because of his YAC ability no doubt.

>I could go on, but I think the fact that he scored 22 touchdowns in a 12 game season, in an era where the defense was still allowed to stop the pass is more convincing than anything else.

In a strike season where 80% of players didn't cross the picket lines; he didn't go against the same caliber of defenses."
34150,">He wasn't really a deep threat as he wasn't very fast. He was a homerun threat because of his YAC ability no doubt.

Yes he was. His slow 40 time was because of a slow front 20. His top speed was really, really, fast."
34151,Jerry Rice or Sweetness.
34152,Chuck Bednarik
34153,"That's the beauty of this game - no clear, outright winner. Good question though; I'd give the nod to Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, or Jon Blackwell."
34154,"It's *reeeaaallly* hard to narrow it down to one, I'd have to go with Jim Brown.  
I can honestly say he'd have all the rushing records if he would have played more than 8 years. The man's a beast."
34156,I didn't know that actually. Thanks for sharing!
34157,"> The man could play any position...

Dubious.  It is highly unlikely he could play O or D line and extremely doubtful that he would have made a good linebacker."
34158,Lawrence Taylor. The most unstoppable force to ever step onto a football field.
34696,Jim Brown
34160,"nfl network already did this and the experts picked jerry rice to be #1 not my biased opinion but what the experts said 

edit:http://top100.nfl.com/all-time-100 heres the list"
34161,"john elway. but again, i'm clearly biased."
34162,"A man walks into a bar and the bartender says, ""Why the long face?""  John Elway replies with, ""Well, I'm either sad, Scottie Pippen, Sarah Jessica Parker, or John Fucking Elway!  You choose.""  Haha, I love that joke."
34163,He did take a couple of teams to the Super Bowl that had no business being there.
34164,Singling out individuals in a team sport!  It's people like you that ESPN thrives on.
34165,"Football isn't a one man game like basketball where you can make an argument that MJ is the best. IMO there is no one great football player. Different times have different players, each playing different roles on a team."
34166,"I love WP. Love. 

But to say he could play any position? Defensive tackle? Quarterback? Punter? Place kicker? Center? Defensive back?

It's like I'm 12 again and arguing with my dumb little brothers. 

Yes he could.

No he couldn't.

Uh-huh.

Nuh-uh."
34167,"John Madden said any position.[I have proof of QB](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4omCZa31d3w) also [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AobfjXLlzRI) has Mike Ditka making the claim that he could play any position, blocking, kicking, tackling, catching. Whatever he needed to do. At one point he even said that he was glad he got to go to the Bears, because a team like the Steelers would have forced him into specialization."
34168,"Wow. I tip my bowler to you and Boom!, Mr. Madden as well. 

As I am but an armchair QB, I will humbly and respectfully disagree. While he may be a phenom of athleticism, he did not have the weight to be a lineman. Ability for moving blocks? Without question. But even the 80s linemen would have eaten him as an appetizer."
34169,"Hard to pick just one because of different eras/rules/positions, but as far as offense goes it is hard to argue against Rice, Montana, Manning, Sanders, Payton, Jim Brown, a few others."
34170,"Probably too late for this, but I'd recommend you watch a series done by the NFL Network called 100 Greatest NFL Players(Jerry Rice was listed as number one). Some of the videos are on youtube (here's a [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/The100greatest) to their channel). Their are a bunch of user videos that complete the list, which im sure you'll be able to find. These videos are great to learn about the history of the game too"
34171,tarkenton
34172,"Chuck bednarik, monster"
34173,My top three are Barry Sanders Dan Marino and John Elway.  Because they achieved the most with the worst supporting cast.  I include John Elway not because of the two super bowl wins where our team was dominant.  But because of the decade he made the team relevant with little to no help from everyone else.
34174,Reggie White
34175,John Hannah
34176,Anthony Munoz
34177,Let's not talk about Walter Payton and playing in that Superbowl...
34178,[Johnny Utah!](http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y107/ManofSteala/misc/johnnyutah.jpg)
34179,Barry Sanders. He did rely on other players to get shit me like Jerry Rice Joe Montana etc.
34181,"They don't think it be like it is, but it do."
34182,F5 szn on Budda Bakers twitter
34183,“Yo PFF stop hatin lol. Never liked PFF lol”
34184,"Top post on r/NFL incoming:

[Baker] “PFF=💩”"
34185,">35 WR JULIO JONES, TENNESSEE TITANS


:("
34186,"Alternatively, :)

RB1, WR5, WR6"
34187,"Brown above Metcalf, the way it’s meant to be. Only person who can stop the Titans offense is Downing"
34188,I’m rooting for the hawks to win the finals bc Atalanta sport needs a win
34189,They even struggle in Serie A too
34190,"I await to be up 3-1 to channel the state curse, and then do the best Atlanta braves impersonation and end with a broken heart. I always tell myself I wouldnt fall for it. But its hope everytime. Its an endless cycle"
34191,What about us 😭
34192,List checks out - there are no Bucs linemen in between Brady and Mack.
34193,I see no room for controversy here
34194,Darius Leonard?
34195,Yessir
34196,Can't wait for him to have his billionth meltdown on twitter over this
34197,"As long as he keeps the twitter meltdowns football related and isn't spouting anti-vax bs or calling Deshaun Watson's accusers liars, I don't have a problem with that."
34198,True football meltdowns are fun
34199,Now that Luck is retired we need an unnecessarily hostile rivalry over Bobby vs Leonard.
34200,"I feel like the edge rankings could change. Mack, joey bosa, TJ watt and myles Garrett could probably be in any order"
34201,"Let's see if this works:

34204,Yeet
34205,I knew T.J. was popping off but damn.
34206,"Nice one, looks like TJ is the clear #1 to me."
34207,until he gets held every play like the true god
34208,And Chase Young is still playing.
34209,"I mean, in the last 40 years there have only been three men who have repeated as rushing champion and ran for 2K: Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders, and Derrick Henry. And Henry isn’t even in the top 10."
34210,PFF even having a RB at 12 is low key surprising
34211,Xavien Howard didn't even crack the top 5 for CBs despite last year being his second year leading the league in picks. First CB with double digit ints in over a decade.
34212,Chirs Jones #19 is kinda a surprise imo.
34213,Kamara at 39
34214,"Unless I missed it, I don't see DK Metcalf on the list, but I do see AJ Brown on there. That raised my eyebrow."
34215,Lower that shit because AJ is the better receiver.
34216,That’s the way it’s supposed to be baby DK got nothing on AJ
34217,Except straight line speed but that’s about it
34218,Aj brown is a better receiver than DK though
34219,No Lamar Jackson is laughable. PFF consistently underrates the added value and offensive efficiency running as a QB has and I'm really tired of it. You can't say you value analytics yet talk about how passing is so much more efficient that running without realizing that running as a QB improves the total offensive efficiency. It really annoys me how biased that analysis of running as a QB is for them.
34220,"Yup, look at Allen, second in mvp voting let’s pretend he didn’t run for 421 yards and 8tds  to go with the 4500 yards and 37 passing tds. Slot him at 40… it’s laughable."
34221,Bakhtiari the 15th best player in the NFL RIGHT NOW even with his torn ACL. That's some heaping praise. Imagine where he'd be on this list after recovering from his ACL injury.
34222,Apparently it’s a list of projections going into 2021 but it still makes no sense.
34223,Why is Lamar not projected to be a top 50 player in the NFL in 2 years lmfao
34224,Hey it makes no sense to me either and that’s what I said about these lists they pick and choose what data and variables to make it work. Some are from strong 2020 seasons and some they use “projections” for 2021
34225,"This list also have the reigning MVP listed as the 3rd QB and 10th overall, so I wouldn't put too much stock into it lol."
34226,They say this list is based off the last few years of play. In that case Rodgers placing 3rd makes sense.
34227,I still don’t see Brady edging out Rodgers’ numbers the last few years.
34228,Brady has been the better QB the last several years if you average them out. No QB in the NFL gets more out of that sad husk of a supporting cast that was the 2019 Patriots offense. Football isnt baseball either. Numbers can't tell you as much in this sport.
34229,This is the most PFF list I’ve ever seen
34230,"Out of all the lists they've made, it is definitely one of them"
34232,"A player I like is too low, and a player I dislike is too high"
34233,You are wrong.  The player you like is not as good as you think.
34234,"Yikes you must not be following my team, my player has been top 10 in ____ and ____ every year since 2018 and top 5 in ____ since 2017."
34235,You're just cherry picking stats.
34236,"That's when he was playing with \_\_\_\_\_\_, who makes anyone good.  Now that he's with \_\_\_\_\_ you see he's actually not good."
34237,"A player I think is better than another player at the same position is lower on the list than them, which invalidates this list entirely"
34238,"I know right, and don’t get me started on them leaving out <insert player here>!"
34239,"That player is not as proficient at football as you believe. The low quality of your opinions suggests that you are a party clown suffering from a closed-head injury.

This player from *my* preferred team, however, is another matter."
34240,But <insert player here> was top 15 in the league in <insert random stat here> in <insert random year here>!
34241,"I love Dak but he's not the 6th best QB in the NFL, especially now that he's returning from a devastating injury"
34242,They seem to think Rodgers is the 10th best player in the NFL.  I wouldn't put much stock in these lists.
34243,Do you think Rodgers is low or high?
34244,It's weird to me that they had Rodgers graded as the best QB last season but have him as the third best now.
34245,Well yeah this is projecting for 2021. I don’t see the problem here
34246,Especially behind Brady
34247,He's the reigning MVP.  Take a guess.
34248,That’s because he plays quarterback though the list isn’t ranking value
34249,"I mean, he's the 3rd QB I'd take.    


I'd take Brady above him, and I'd take Mahomes above him"
34250,"I agree with this, although I think basically any ordering of those three at the top is defensible"
34251,"Low, wtf?  They have him as not even the best offensive player on the Packers..."
34252,"Really hard to rate Dak right now... on one hand you could unfairly down grade him based on injury, on the other you could unfairly up grade him based on insane unsustainable stats from a short season. 6th best definitely seems like the current ceiling of the rankings. It is definitely generous, but not completely indefensible."
34253,"Lol had this argument in our vikings sub, theres people that think this dude is borderline top 10 when hes is top 5 if not that top 8 i guess cause he plays for the cowboys"
34254,Probably put Watson ahead of him
34255,"[In May PFF did](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-quarterback-rankings-all-32-starters-ahead-of-the-2021-nfl-season)
Not sure what changed.

EDIT: someone posted this from the article
>The ranking below is a projection of what we think will happen and not necessarily a reaction to a spectacular or underwhelming 2020 season.

Watson probably not there because of looming suspension?"
34256,Or a looming prison sentence
34257,dak > that massage addict
34258,"Bears fans, is Khalil Mack really the 6th best player in the league? He's good at stopping the run, forcing fumbles, and drops into coverage too, right?"
34259,"I think it depends on how they are defining \*best\* player in the league. It seems like they built this list controlling for positional value. 

Based on how PFF rates D-line players, they make a compelling argument that he should be this high on the list. When looking at his pass rush win rate and overall disruption rather than raw sack numbers, his performance warrants this high of a rating. PFF basically says that Mack consistently wins his 1-1 matchups and that matters more to them and their rankings than raw sack numbers.   


All that to say, I think Mack should be very high on this list, but I was surprised to see him come in at number 6."
34260,They say in the article that this is not weighted by position value. Just an overall estimate based on the grades they got from PFF in the past.
34261,">PFF basically says that Mack consistently wins his 1-1 matchups and that matters more to them and their rankings than raw sack numbers.

As it should. Sacks happen 5-15 times a year for most. Why in the world would we limit our evaluation to maybe 10 reps a year over the other 600 times they were on the field? Give me someone with no sacks winning 25% of the time over someone like Jarran Reed having 7 sacks as a DT while being fucking awful on the rest of his reps"
34262,"I agree with you and PFF on that 100%! 

They (Steve Palazolo & Sam Monson) did a great job discussing this topic on one of their recent podcasts. I forgot which player they were discussing, but basically over a 3-year period the pass rush win rating for this guy was in the mid 60s (something like 62; 66; 64), but during that period his sack numbers were something like 3, 8, 2. So essentially, even though the player had steady pass rush performance it did not reliably predict the likelihood of a sack. I agree with them, there is too much variability in what happens after a pass rush win (i.e. QB throws ball away, rolls out, scrambles, slides into another rusher who gets the sack, etc.) that makes using sacks as the end all be all stat for pass rushing misguided at best."
34263,"He led the league in pass rushing wins last year. That's his job, all the other outcomes after winning his rep are out of his control. He is absolutely deserving of the spot."
34264,He’s not better than garrett
34265,How is he better than current TJ Watt
34266,He's not nearly as scheme / blitz dependent
34267,"According to pffs top 10 edge players posted here yesterday, Mack isn’t even top 10 edge 🤦‍♂️"
34268,"That was CBS, not PFF. PFF has been vocal all year about how they think Mack is the best edge in the league."
34269,Oh nice. Yeah CBS is ass and Khalil Mack is the real deal.
34270,"uh pff has him 1.

like literally 1"
34271,He's the only one that got past rookie extraordinaire Tristan Wirfs so he's good

34273,"Ah yes, 49ers, Rams, and Seahawks all in the top 5. The NFC West is indeed a bloodbath."
34274,"So many good players on the NFC West teams not listed here too: DK, Jamal, Whitworth, Baker, JJ, Jones, etc."
34275,"John Dorsey is ""responsible"" for 4 of these guys and was in the room for a 5th with Aaron Rodgers"
34276,If only he could write contracts half as well as he could draft.
34277,"> Absolutely correct.

*--Chefs Fan*"
34278,Great googly moogly
34279,"Dorsey was definitely wrong regarding coaches for us, but I am so thankful for his roster moves for Cleveland. He definitely set us up to succeed."
34280,I love that we got all the way to the AFC championship despite having only two in the top 50 and 0 in the top 25. Shows how solid our team is from top to bottom.
34281,Shows the value of a great QB too
34282,Also how underrated our stars are. A couple of these guys listed above *anyone* on our team has me scratching my head but what's new.
34283,Small market teams don't get the credit.
34284,What guys on this list do you think are worse than every player on the Bills?
34285,"Well let me reframe the question because that's not at all what I said. A few players who IMO should not be ranked over every Bills player include Eric Kendricks, Allen Robinson, and AJ Brown. Not that it matters."
34286,I’m a homer pick here but AJ is an absolute stud and he’s shown it over the last two seasons
34287,"He's damn good, I just wouldn't put him over Diggs right this second."
34288,"Give it time, another couple years."
34289,But I thought the Packers had wasted Rodgers career with low talent teams??
34290,They didn’t waste his career regardless because he won a fucking Super Bowl anyways
34291,Dan Marino hated this comment
34292,"This is the dumbest narrative ever from fans.

In the last few years Rodgers has had a top 3 O-Line, very good RBs and below average receivers (Adams is a top 5 receiver but the rest are a meh so it evens out). That's literally no different to what Lamar Jackson had in his MVP season and I don't think anyone would say we failed to provide him good surrounding talent that year.

For some reason people on seem to look at receivers, despite the fact that Rodgers himself and many other QBs have said they'd much rather have a good O-Line than good receivers. We don't constantly hear about how little Wilson or Ryan had to work with even though their O-Lines have been bad."
34293,"It's only a ""wasted career"" because Brady and the Pats have ruined any ounce of nuance forever

Not getting 3+ superbowls now means you are shit"
34294,"Brady having 7 is just stupid. Manning was as good or better than most of the QBs we have discussed in this thread and he had to be carried to his 2nd just to join the multiple SB club. So many all time greats have two or fewer. Their careers weren’t/aren’t “wasted,” it’s just really hard to win one, let alone multiple."
34295,"> Manning was as good or better than most of the QBs we have discussed in this thread and he had to be carried to his 2nd just to join the multiple SB club.

Also because of Brady. Who knows how many he would have won without that constant competition?"
34296,Agreed completely. The team regularly shits the bed on the biggest stages (NFCCG) and people talk like the team is talentless besides Rodgers. What a crock!
34297,The 2020 draft did no favors for killing this narrative.
34298,"People just hold onto narratives too long at times. Rodgers has played long enough that the ebb and flow of rosters has given him good teams periodically. GB had pretty damn good rosters from '09-14 (won a Superbowl), a decent lack of talent from '15-18 (drafting trending poorly, McCarthy era ends), and then good rosters again '19-present (results TBD)."
34299,"They act like because his defense was shitty for a few years it means his career was wasted, ignoring his defense during the SB year was elite.  Also ignoring the fact that Brees and Manning had awful defenses for a good portion of their careers."
34300,"It's a dumb argument, but this list also is kinda shit. 

You're telling me the reigning MVP is #10 overall, and his WR, who isn't even a lock for best WR in the game, is #5? The next best WRs are listed at 17 and 18. I don't agree with that in the slightest."
34301,3 of the top 5 are NFC West. I hate our division :(
34302,"Noticeably missing is Xavien Howard. I know he gives up a lot in coverage, but I thought PFF still had him rated fairly highly?"
34303,They crucified him for those bs DPIs against Hopkins. In what world do you lead the league in picks (10) and you aren't even in the top 50 PFF players?
34304,"> In what world do you lead the league in picks (10) and you aren't even in the top 50 PFF players?

In a world where this list is the 50 best players in the NFL for **2021**. From the introduction:

> [""The ranking below is a projection of what we think will happen and not necessarily a reaction to a spectacular or underwhelming 2020 season.""](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-pff50-ranking-50-best-players-nfl-2021)

PFF already released a list of the top players for the 2020 season only and Howard was 26th. But for this list, they're considering past performance as well as projecting for this year, so leaving Howard (who isn't young and doesn't have a spotless record of performance with 2 good years and 3 meh ones) off seems fine to me."
34305,"I mean he missed 11 games in 2019, so he’s been great 2018-2020 (when he plays). So he gets punished because he wasn’t great as a rookie and a sophomore? (he was great the last 5 games of his sophomore year)."
34306,"It's a stupid PFF list, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Howard is going to play however he plays, regardless of where PFF 'projects' him to play.

People are downvoting because they get REAL upset when people criticize really stupid lists PFF produces."
34307,"I think he should switch spots with Bradberry, I have respect for Bradberry a lot though."
34308,Bro Howard is a beast and gets shit on all the time it’s wild.
34309,Losing JJ3 hurts. Hopefully the youngins back there continue progressing so his departure is not as noticeable. Browns got a good one.
34311,Lol indeed bro
34312,The fact that he went from 1 on the NFL 100 last year to not even on a bunch of these lists is so stupid.
34313,I'm not even that mad knowing that Lamar isn't going to be fazed by this shit.
34314,it's absurd
34315,The stark fall of Thomas and Kamara is… something
34316,Thomas was injured the majority of last year? Kamara is listed as the 5th best running back? Making this list in itself is impressive. This list has them as top 50 out of 1664 roster makers. That's high bro
34317,Thomas I’m okay with because of the injuries - wouldn’t have been shocked to see him off altogether - but Kamara is definitely top 20 at least.
34318,"As a homer, I agree. But this is pff and their ""projection"" for next year, so it'll be fun when he shocks them runs for 2.5k and wins mvp"
34319,Am I crazy for thinking jalen Ramsey should be top ten
34320,"PFFs top WR in the league, in order:

1.	Davante Adams
2.	 Deandre Hopkins
3.	Tyreek Hill 
4.	Allen Robinson
5.	Julio Jones
6.	AJ brown
7.	Michael Thomas
8.	Stefan Diggs"
34321,I think the top 3 is probably correct and can be in whatever order they are all pretty close but 4-8 is spicy.
34322,"I can see Julio and MT above Diggs, but I have a hard time putting AJ and Robinson over him.  If we're looking at just this year, I'd have Diggs at 4 though."
34323,Yeah Diggs at 8 after what he did last year is a bit surprising to me too. Especially since he now gets a full offseason program with Josh. I figured he should be 4 or 5 as well.
34324,"Yup, I can understand if it was based on the Vikings, but after seeing him come in and boss out with a QB that they were shitting on, I'm a little surprised."
34325,I don’t know how anyone gets Robinson over Diggs on any list lol
34326,"He was really carried by the NVP no doubt, and now that we have him too, that just doubled Diggs up imo"
34327,"So no First Team All-Pro Xavien Howard? 

Cool, cool, cool, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt"
34328,"Weird, 4 safeties on this list and the best one in the league is not here lol"
34329,Literally no Minkah or Jessie Bates is awful lmao
34330,"So Jackson isn't a top 50 player ""right now"" or heading into next season...ok..."
34331,"If this list is a measure of how good a player has been and is projected to be over the past few Years, then Lamar should be in over Dak. If this list is solely for this year (or the pace they were on for this year since Dak got injured) then Aaron Rodgers shouldn't be the 3rd QB on the list. I know this is a clickbait meme list anyway but I'm still pissed at just how bad this list is."
34332,Gimmie Lamar over Prescott any day of the year.
34333,Dude the amount of people who continue to hate or sleep on Lamar annoys the shit out of me lol
34334,They keeping that chip on Jackson's shoulder. Nothing's changed since Louisville
34335,It blows my mind honestly
34336,The fact that Dak got in over him is just straight bananas.
34337,"Sir! Sirrrrr! 

Why is Thomas Brady so low? He is the God-king of football. 

This is an outrage! 

ree"
34338,WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?
34339,I know I’m biased but not having Justin tucker- arguably the greatest kicker ever- or Lamar in the top 50 is absurd
34340,I just read the list a few times.  I thought OP messed up because Lamar was not in top 10.  Is this list from 2017?
34341,"So Aaron Rodgers who has more tds, less interceptions, a better completion rate is number 10 but Brady is 7? Only thing Brady is ahead in is yards"
34342,"TDs are very volatile year to year, interceptions a little less so, completion percentage is very stable, but also more indicative of offensive style and not something related to winning until you start getting shockingly low."
34343,"Basically all QB stats are heavily influenced by their team.  The personnel, the style of offense, the weapons they have, etc, etc.

There's a big difference between good stats and bad stats, but when 2 QB's are both putting up good stats, it's usually splitting hairs to claim one is measurably ahead of the other."
34344,"Yeah, other than Cmp% the most reliable thing year to year is PFF grade, you can argue there's some autocorrelation going on in QBs they just like, but I do think it says something about subjective views of QB play being very valuable."
34345,"From the original article:

> The ranking below is a projection of what we think will happen and not necessarily a reaction to a spectacular or underwhelming 2020 season."
34346,That’s what I don’t like about these lists they are basically just whims. Not even based on logic I’m not directing it at you I’m just speaking to the group. You’re telling me Bakhtiari is expected to come back from an acl tear and be the best tackle? Or that Henry will have the same production despite the Titans adding Julio Jones? Or nick chubb won’t have a better season the mccaffrey
34347,Look where Allen is ranked. This list is just bad.
34348,"They mention Brady having to adjust to a new offensive scheme and team. See Rodgers’ 2018-19 for how challenging just the first portion can be. 

So projecting Brady does even better now that he’s had time to jive isn’t a stretch, especially if our star WRs stay healthy throughout the season.

They are also likely taking projected strength of schedule into account, where the Bucs’ next season will be a lot easier than the Packers’."
34350,"I feel like we have so many players who could *potentially* crack the top 50 on our team at some point soon, but yeah I agree that we don't have one yet."
34351,Jesse Bates snubbbed again:(
34352,"Lol PFF and their Bills bias. Top WR in yards and receptions, yup let’s slot him at 45.  QBRT who came second in MVP voting ohhh 40 sounds good.  They will never get over the Bills beating Math."
34353,"tHe PaCkErS hAvE nObOdY HeLpInG AaRoN rOgErS. 

Packers have three players in the top 20, not including Rodgers himself."
34354,No Justin Jefferson??? We riot.
34355,"One of the PFF guys was on Purple Inside with Matthew Coller and basically said ""his one year indicates he is top two at his position but everyone ahead of him has done that as well"".  They don't even have him in their top Wrs."
34356,"Rodgers feels kind of low...#10 for the reigning MVP 

And Devante Adams had an incredible season last year, but I'm not sure he's 5 spots ahead of Rodgers"
34357,Myles Garrett is way too low on this list though if it wasn’t for covid we’d be talking about Myles the dpoy
34358,I was going to say he was too high.
34359,Imagine making a list of the top 50 players in the league and not putting DeForest Buckner on it.
34360,It's weirdly pissing me off. It's a list that literally means nothing but Buckner was so good last year. Wish he got more respect
34361,"This is some of the stupidest shit I've seen in awhile. It's not even about where Allen/Diggs are ranked (which I don't agree with), but I feel like the people who created this steaming pile of ass don't even watch football."
34362,I know it's your opinion but mahomes is clearly #1.
34363,"I have a hard time saying that Aaron Donald isn't the best player in the NFL, and the most valuable if you adjust for positional values.  Do I think Mahomes makes a bigger impact on a game?  Yes, but he is a QB.  Every QB should make a bigger impact than a DT in the overall outcome of the game...  But, I just don't see anyone nearly as value for their position in the NFL as Aaron Donald.  The guy does the job of both a DE and a DT on the same play, all while facing double teams.  If Donald goes down for an injury, I think the Rams D fall to the middle of the pack, if not worse."
34364,Donald is the king for sure but if a team could have Mahomes or Donald I think most are going to pick mahomes.
34365,">47. CB JAMES BRADBERRY, NEW YORK GIANTS

That's my CB #1."
34366,"OP, if you’d like to mess with the formatting at all, based on your last comment, you can highlight all the text and hit Shift + F3 (Fn too), you can cycle between all the text being all caps, lower case, or the first letter of each word capitalized."
34367,"PFF Graded Buckner quite a bit higher than Jarrett, but Buckner didn't even make the damn list and Jarrett did?"
34368,I don't understand how Robinson is the 4th best receiver in the league.
34369,Guy has balled out in the league with dumpster fire level qbing.
34370,"I'm honestly very surprised to see Grady Jarrett up so high. Not because he doesn't deserve it, he absolutely does. He's a fantastic player. He just so rarely gets respect from playing on such terrible defenses his whole career."
34371,Someone please tweet this at Darius Leonard!
34372,Forwarded to Von Miller.
34373,I feel like Darren Waller should be up here.
34374,Absolute cap that you put Prescott on and leave Tannehill off
34375,No Lamar Jackson is blasphemous.
34376,Myles > mack
34377,Myles + Helmet > Rudolph
34378,Lol Brady over Rodgers
34379,2 TE in the top 9. And Darren waller isn't even top 50 :\ the disrespect
34380,No way there are 50 NFL players better than Lamar Jackson
34748,Jerry Rice.
34382,System receiver!
34383,"The ""throw it to Jerry rice a lot"" system"
34384,I actually think it was called the Stickum Coast Offense.
34386,If only coach had put him in...
34387,"They'd be state champs, no doubt in my mind."
34388,Pele
34389,"Oh man, triggered. 

Pele wasn't even the best Brazilian of his time, never mind the best ever. Most popular, probably, best, not even close. Ask any Brazilian in their 60s or older, Garrincha was a  better footballer. Also, (Fat) Ronaldo, Romario, and Neymar were/are all better Brazilian strikers. They just weren't around when Brazil won every game by a bag of goals with one main striker like Pele was.

Wrong sub to rant about this, but one sure way to separate actual soccer fans from casuals is to ask this question and see what they say. If they say Pele, I immediately know they don't watch much soccer.

Maradona, Cruyff, van Basten, Best, Muller, Eusebio... the list of better attacking footballers goes on. And I'm ignoring defensive players.

But to end with an answer, rather than just needless whining, Messi and Ronaldo are the #1 and #2 of all time. Modern day athletes are just superior in every way, thanks to modern day training, diets, etc, and improved opposition. And those two just separate themselves from the pack, even by modern standards."
34390,The fact that Pele didn't play in Europe (to the best of my knowledge) is also a huge knock on him because the Brazilian league has never been that great.
34391,Santos was a legendary team that made up the core of those World Cup winning Brazilian teams. The league wasn't great but Pele definitely played for a team that had the quality of a European side. I agree though that he isn't the undisputed soccer GOAT
34392,"Your point is actually one of the reasons why I believe he's over-rated. Sure his team was great, but his opponents weren't. He made a career from always being on a team that was vastly superior to his opposition, both internationally and domestically. Not that it's his fault that Brazil were so much better than those around them."
34393,"Playing on the good team rather than against it is the knock. Sure his team was European quality but the majority of the league wasn't of that quality and that's who he was playing against. To me there isn't an undisputed GOAT, it comes down to Messi, Best, Maradona and a few other guys."
34394,"Yeah it all comes down to opposition, and his opposition for 99% of his games was abysmal. 

The fact that he also did well at World Cups shouldn't be ignored and I'm not trying to dismiss that. He's a legend of the game, just not in that top tier."
34395,ThANK YOU
34396,"I would give Messi that crown if he was always consistent. He's definitely the most talented ever. Copa America this year is a great example of his inconsistency. He just can't get over his championship game letdowns. 
Maradonna wins, hands down."
34397,"Inconsistent? Messi is the most consistently excellent player there ever was. The dude has been the best or 2nd best player in the world every year for the last 9 years, with 50-90 goal seasons where he carries arguably the greatest team of all time. While playing alongside Suarez and Neymar, he still stands out as the key player. He's the Champions League and La Liga record scorer. I could go on and on, this is the easiest point I'll ever make.

>championship game letdowns

8 league titles. 4 Champions Leagues. 11 domestic tournaments. Olympic gold medalist. And several other smaller titles. Whether it's his 91 goal season, on the CL final when he single-handedly dismantled Manchester United, he has been the key to a boatload of titles.

Messi hasn't had the same success with the national team, many accusing him of underperforming... yet he has 56 goals in 114 games, compared to Maradona's 34 in 91. Messi underperforming has done more for Argentina than Maradona ever did. All in an era when Argentina were significantly less dominant on the world stage, with a much weaker squad (compared to the competition)."
34398,"International play is exactly what I'm referring to. His play has been excellent until he gets to a final. Then he shits the bed. He absolutely is both more talented and more athletic than Maradona ever was but he hasn't been able to carry his country to the win. I also believe the players around Messi are far more talented than the ones Maradona played with. Maradona played a much larger  role in his teams success than Messi has. I do have Messi at #2 and would certainly move him ahead if he gets over the yips in 2018.
Comparing stats for players from different eras is just as flawed as it is in the NFL. Rule changes to promote scoring have been very effective and play just as much a role as the better training and athleticism of today's athletes has."

34410,The downvote button isn't a disagree button.
34411,"It's a legitimate answer.  Many consider him the GOAT defensive player or GOAT pass rusher.  If you value that highly, it could affect your decision on who is the greatest player.

Also, there is his influence as a player even outside of what he did on the field.  He revolutionized free agency."

34424,"There is no single great because of 2 reasons 

1: People opinions 

2: You can't compare positions to other (can't compare rb to safety"
34425,I would counter that argument with this; Jerry Rice.  Just look at all time NFL records and try to find ones he doesn't have.
34426,"Most sacks, most tackles, most rushing yards, most passes completed....can do this all day."
34427,Way to take my statement literally.
34428,True but Randy is the true GOAT wide receiver.
34429,"If Jerry, Terrell and Marvin were erased from history yeah maybe"
34430,Randy was better then T.O.
34431,"Jesus TO is HOF no doubt but i don't see how you can put him in the same sentence as Jerry and Moss. As for Marvin, if you put arguably in front of his name then sure."
34432,"I would wager that I'm better at playing 8 ball pool on my phone, than Tom Brady is at playing QB (I have a LONG commute o.k.) that doesn't make me a better athlete.

You've got to look at how skilled people are at their particular position, but you've also got to look at how relevant their skill is. there's no skill more relevant than QB in football. The best QB is the best player"
34433,"the greatest QB ever is the the greatest player ever because nobody at any other position can impact that game like a QB

The case used to be that Montana was Jordan, and Brady was Lebron, but that has changed. Brady hasnèt usurped Montana as Jordan, now there are 2 Jordans.

People can tell me that's a cop out, but it's the right answer, damn it"
34434,"Montana and Brady are very similar.  Obviously Brady directly benefits from new rules and more passing.  Both benefit from having the best coach of their era (and its not even close), one who revolutionized NFL offenses and another who attacks weakness like probably no other in history.  It's real hard to compare them because Montana definitely has more clutch moments of his own, where Brady I don't think won a single Super Bowl with a clutch play, but that's not a knock on him just saying the highlights are defensive ones or a field goal late.  I'd argue the NFC of the 80's was more of a rough ride than the AFC of the 2000's as well, Manning and Steelers (And sometimes Ravens) aside."
34435,"I think going 13/15 for 150 yards 2 TDs in the 4th quarter of a Super Bowl down by 10 points is pretty clutch. Also the last drive of Super Bowl 36. If anything, Montana doesn't have as many clutch Super Bowl plays because his teams were blowing the other opponent out lol."
34436,"Like I said, I'm not knocking Brady at all.  I'm just saying from a highlight perspective you'll always remember the Catch or the Jerry Rice touchdown with barely any time left against the Bengals in the Super Bowl.  Brady's comparable plays are the Tuck Rule play, Vinitieri kicking a game winner, or the defense making an interception.  It's strictly circumstantial and really only affects the eye test if you factor in biggest moments."
34437,"> Jerry Rice touchdown with barely any time left against the Bengals in the Super Bowl

i genuinely have no idea what you're talking about. perhaps that play isn't as iconic as you think?

you're basically punishing Brady here for not having short clocks or not needing TDs. against the Rams Brady lead a game-winning field goal drive with a short clock, and against the Giants ('08) and Seahawks Brady lead TD drives to take the lead with fewer than 2 minutes left. against the Giants the defense gave the game back and against the Seahawks it almost did. Neither of those undo the fact that Brady lead his team to a TD late when he needed to."
34438,"You're apparently missing the point. There wasn't a single iconic play listed there. Yes it was clutch, but both times the iconic plays were special teams, defense, or the other teams scoring drive. I blatantly said it was entirely circumstantial, but you're kidding yourself if you don't think a ton of fans still think of Montana for big clutch moments.  You mention the Rice TD not being iconic but I beg the differ. Pretty sure that whole drive is legendary from Montana calmly pointing out John Candy in the stands, to driving down field and scoring the latest go ahead touchdown in Super Bowl history."
34439,"no, i'm pretty sure you're missing the point here - Montana's plays are iconic to you because you're a 49ers fan. it's also why you give them undue weight.

when Brady has retired i don't think any non-biased fans are going to look back on those two and point to any discrepancy in iconic plays."
34440,"You're wrong. Period. For the hundredth time; the lack of iconic plays is not a knock on Brady, it's totally circumstantial. But perception is reality for a lot of people and Joe Cool has the more famous moments. Period. Go watch an NFL films movie or something. Me being a 49ers fan has nothing to do with the the thousands of times I've seen Montana's plays. The only ones from Brady that I see are the tuck, field goals, and interceptions. Get over it, get your head out of the sand and stop trying to argue a dumb thing to argue about. The Catch > The Tuck, period, end of story, no debate, go home and get over it. Stop crying about someone saying Brady is as good as Montana but that a lot of people (not me) wont agree due to Montana's iconic moments and never losing or throwing a so much as an interception in the Super Bowl. You done yet?  I'm tired of explaining how this works for someone who has no knowledge of NFL history, or is completely unaware of how a lot of people dislike Brady and will never put him over Montana. This stupid argument you're having with yourself while ignoring the context of what I'm saying is over."
34441,I guess Venitari drove the Patriots 61 yards with 1 minute left and no timeouts on top kicking that game winning field goal right? I don't think I've ever met someone who doesn't think Brady has any memorable playoff or super bowl moments as well as not being clutch.
