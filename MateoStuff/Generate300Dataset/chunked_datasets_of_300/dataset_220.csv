72517,"The M has 2 key rollover for some very specific combinations.  Most of the sets of keypresses in the gaming area have 5-7 key rollover.

x-key rollover means the absolute minimum number of keys that can cause the board to stop registering new key presses, not the maximum number you can ever press."
72518,Going to be completely honest. Cherry MX Blues for the sound.
72519,"For gaming? Eeewwwww. Upvote for honest opinion, but it's a bad one."
72520,"I've been gaming on blues for nearly a year now. It feels so good. I have a board with Gateron Browns and one with MX Browns and I can't imagine gaming on anything but my Blues. Well, I can easily image it. The Gateron Browns are actually super smooth and would technically be a better choice, but I like my blues. They're fun."
72521,"I game on blues and they're fine. I think people overstate the impact that 5 grams will have when you're in the thick of it.

Honestly, I gamed for years on an IBM model M and I had no issues with it. It was firm, responsive, and delightfully pingy."
72522,"It's not the extra weight, it's the plunger. You can't release without raising farther so rapid, repeated keying is more difficult. Think ""mash X"". Blacks, I think, have the same weight without the plunge.  

Also the model M doesn't have cherry switches at all. They're buckling springs. Blues are built to somewhat imitate them."
72523,"I'm aware. The membrane buckling springs have a ~70 gram actuation force and are my preferred key-switch due to the immediate tactile and auditory feedback compared to the slightly delayed feedback of MX switches. Also the lovely metallic hum that they tend to create when you're typing away.

The point was more that activation force is an overstated issue. You won't notice it after a bit of use. Really, any of them are fine for gaming once you're accustomed to them. I've gone down that rabbit hole and found that there's not a whole not of reason to overthink it.

Edit: corrected find to fine"
72524,"I don't think there's a lot of reason to over think, but be real: there's differences for a reason. The way blue switches work vs Brown/red/black is very different and again, not very conducive to some (popular) styles of gaming. When you're spending upwards of a hundred and fifty on a keyboard (minimum) you ought to get the right information to help decide which you'll prefer. I think for a person just now ""going mechanical"" with games in mind that blues are a bad choice."
72525,"I've been on blues for a couple years and have no problem with adadada strafing or repeating key presses rapidly. You grow accustomed to the force and the activation threshold so it becomes a non-issue. O-rings are also pretty useful for reducing the distance your keys travel, and depending on hardness they'll dampen some click in clicky switches. Those problems become more apparent coming off reds or browns than anything else I think. I can't stand reds or browns though. The click on the browns feel like broken blues, and I just end up pressing too many wrong random keys with reds. The required force on both of them is too small and I can't even tell I've pressed them, especially wearing headphones. 
If I had to pick a linear switch I'd go for black because it requires even more force than blues. 

And if I wanted the world to hate me, greens ;)."
72527,"I've had push to talk on for years for this very reason! At this point It's muscle memory that if I'm talking while using a computer, I move my thumb to my PTT button. Even when I'm not using my computer. Or my mouse. And I'm talking to somebody IRL."
72528,"I can't imagine blues in a fast paced game. Reds are too sensitive, I'm with your assessment of Browns. Best compromise between reliability and speed. No clack of blues though."
72529,Once yin get used to reds they are real nice.
72530,"Out the the switches I've used Gateron Browns because I like the bump browns have and they are smoother than Cherry browns.  I've heard Zealios are better but I don't feel like paying $.75- $1 per switch atm. 

Clicky switches (greens, blues)  are also fine, but I don't like linear switcher (blacks, reds) ."
72531,If you like browns but are willing to take on a little more weight Zeals are perfect. I have a 78g zeal Planck I use for non-fps stuff and it's a dream.
72532,I'll likely pick up some 67g or 78g eventually. Just have to find a board i like that allows hot swapping since I don't want to solider. (my vision sucks)
72533,"It's literally down to preference. I like Cherry MX Blues because I can feel the actuation and the clicking is satisfying. My fiancee, on the other hand, prefers Browns because she can still sleep while I am using them."
72534,"My preference is 65g zealios, but i often leave that keyboard at work by accident, and then my spare board of reds does OK."
72535,All about the feelios
72536,"Its preference, but if your aiming is gaming, then id say the Cherry MX ""Speeds"" or Silver, they have the fastest actuation point and give a slight edge. They're like reds in feel though, but they're also exclusive to the some models from Corsair that are not exactly cheap.

Feel wise, my K70 RGB Rapidfire is amazing."
72537,"While not my personal favorite switch, if you're going for mostly gaming you should invest into Red switches.

* They're on the quiet side of mechanical switches, so lots of key presses and spamming keys won't be as loud and clacky as others (which isn't much of a problem if you live alone, but with others such as SO or roommates it can be fairly annoying for them)

* they're a softer switch, so it requires less pressure to register a key press, which means overall less stress on your fingers over longer sessions.

* there's also a long enough distance between where the switch registers and where it bottoms out, which is ideal for ""double tapping"", which allows you to quickly press the keys multiple time with each one registering without having to wait for the key to return.

Personally i prefer brown switches myself, but that's because i spend nearly as much time actually typing as i do gaming, and browns offer a nice mix of quiet and comfort while still having a relatively high actuation force that makes long typing sessions feel way less strenuous."
72538,"Honestly use a key tester.  
Red and browns are usually what are recommend but honest after buying reds and trying browns I'm not a fan of either. I actually like MX Blues the best for gaming. Reds are too linear and browns to me feel mushy and blues just feel great, people say blues are stiff, they're stiffer but they're not at all a hassle to type on."
72539,*switch tester
72540,">use a key switcher.

What is that? Have any links to some?"
72541,He meant a Switch Tester. You can buy them off Amazon for under $20. Look for the 6-key Switch Tester by WASD Keyboards.
72542,I had blues now I have MX speeds on the new K95.  Typing I prefer the speeds for gaming I can't tell much of a difference.  Sound I prefer the speeds.  Speeds sound closest to reds for reference.
72543,"I have the WASD Code with MX Clear keys and while it's not really a ""gaming"" keyboard I think it feels and looks fantastic and the MX clear switches have a nice level of resistance to them."
72544,"I've got several mechanical keyboards with browns, blues, greens and clears. Got to say the Code with clears is the one I keep coming back to."
72545,I have the same board and I love it!
72546,"MX reds becacuse they are a lighter switch in terms of actuation force and feels comfortable in my hands
Though, I do like most switches anyway"
72547,"I find, unless you're a twitch-shooter type gamer, that reds tend to be too sensitive without any bump. I prefer using Brown switches as a good compromise. Typing can be a real pain on red switches, in my experience."
72548,"I play CS, BF, OW, and LoL... and sometimes gears. So yes, it's why I have reds. And Osu."
72549,Poor Black switches don't get any love.
72550,"Are blacks your preference? I know they are heavier than the others, but what googles tells me is most membrane keyboards have about the same or heavier actuation point anyway (60+g). This would be my first mech keyboard buy so I'm a little nervous, I don't really want to go down the rabbit hole of buying a ton of different switches :P"
72551,"My preference is the MX Reds as well.

I actually switched to mechanical (MX Red) recently and have noticed a lot less hand fatigue while typing or gaming."
72552,"I originally was leaning towards brown switches but now I feel nervous because everyone claims red is superior for gaming. However, I'm going to be using this as an all-around keyboard but play things like Overwatch and League of Legends. As such, which should I go with?"
72553,"Clears or reds IMO, Browns have a really weak bump"
72554,"The fact of the matter is, as it's been repeated multiple times, you should use the ones you enjoy. At the end of the day, no amount of in depth analysis of actuation force and rise time and other metrics make a difference in the vast majority of usecases. Even if you're a pseudo-serious gamer, it's highly unlikely that you're at a competitive level where these subtle differences will make a major detriment between wins and losses.

The point I'm attempting to make is that many, many gamers will emphasize things like hardware, fps, or even character selection as the reason they are winning and losing when in actuality, the raw technical skill is far more important in nearly all spheres except the highest levels of competitive, professional play."
72555,"I recently got a Corsair K70 with reds because reds were proclaimed king for gaming.

I'm starting to warm up to it since it's my first mechanical, but the keys activate VERY easily. I'll find a lot of times I'm resting my fingers on the keys and pressing them without trying to. I wish I could try out blues or brown but I got this keyboard for pretty cheap refurbished so I can't complain. Just a word of warning to anyone who might read this."
72556,Vintage blacks or cherry clears with springs swapped to 62g ones.
72557,"If price is a concern, and you want the best for sub-$50, shipped? Get an AT101W Dell with SKCM Black Alps. Just do it, and have better tactility than any Cherry with none of the hysteresis."
72558,65g zelios at the moment. Used to use clears but then swapped to zelios. They are nice that they are lighter as the clears were a bit heavy but I did play with them for a year. I really do like the bump though in the zelios. Will be building a 67g zelios build next and try them out.
72559,My preference is blacks. I used to use reds and found myself accidentally pressing keys even after a good year of use while playing games like LoL or Overwatch. I never have that problem w/ blacks and don't experience fatigue like others sometimes complain about.
72560,"Brown Masterrace checking in.

JK - You're going to get a ton of subjective replies here. Try them out and see what you prefer, as everyone is different here."
72561,"I have a Unicomp (buckling spring) and love it.  Not a HUGE gamer, but every few months I'll get super into TF2 for a while.  Never had any issues.

I haven't used any of the cherry switches through so I couldn't give you a comparison. I just know it beats the hell out of a cheap membrane keyboard."
72562,"I use mx greens (very clicky, very heavy) but my hands have a tendency to click when I don't mean to click. I constantly right click my mouse inadvertently."
72563,What keyboard do you use? I want greens but am having a hard time finding them in products.
72564,I use a Ducky Shine 4 with MX Greens. The WASD Code and MK Fission also have greens available. So do some of the other Ducky boards.
72565,Has to be a razer keyboard if I'm not mistaken
72566,Razer keyboards aren't real greens. Razer Greens are actually MX Blue clones.
72567,Oh ok wasn't aware that there was MX Greens. What are they like?
72568,"Wow Greens, I love them because I type like a Neanderthal. Blues are alright but man, when can we see Green RGB switches?"
72569,"It's a coolermaster tenkeyless, no lights or anything. I don't think they make it anymore."
72570,"My favorite are the Cherry MX Reds. Better for gaming than for typing. Quiet and smooth. They encourage bottoming out because there is no activation feedback. This makes them a little awkward if you do a lot of typing, though. Typists generally prefer blues or browns. There are many more switches which mostly vary in travel distance and pressure required to press them."
72571,"It's totally personal preference. It seems like a lot of ""pros"" use reds, and maybe they're slightly better but *to me* they don't really feel hugely different than rubber domes. I only tried them for about five minutes but I found them totally nondescript.

Blues are my favorite to type because of the sound... but they're loud enough that honestly I get self conscious using blues in a room where there are other people trying to do things that involve their ears.

So brown are probably my favorite overall."
72572,"I currently have mx blues but I find that a lot of the time it doesn't naturally reset when my fingers are on it and it is in the position where the click is. Wouldn't reccomend it for first person games, it's better for mobas I Guess. I've tried mx reds and browns and I like them both better."
72573,Love my Pok3r with clears. 55-95g of force not terribly clicky. I used to game on greens but the click eventually became too much for me lol.
72574,I don't play fast twitchy competitive games so I go with my normal preference which is Gateron Greens by about 1000 miles.
72575,"As everyone else has said already it's all personal preference, I thought for sure I'd like blues or browns for typing and gaming, and I'm not a massive fan for either, I prefer linears.  I've just picked up a board with Gateron Yellow switches on, my favourite so far, a bit harder than Cherry Red and a bit softer than Cherry Black, plus Gateron switches are much smoother to press than Cherry switches (which are a little scratchy) which is a bonus."
72576,"Brown. I like the tactile bump. I also like the click-sound that the blue switch has, but I think it would drive my girlfriend nuts."
72577,"Typing on MX Blues, gaming on MX Browns."
72578,"It's depend on your personal preference mainly. 

To me there's nothing more satisfying than gaming on a light weight linear switch like MX Red. However I also like typing on it, and many people don't, so there's that. If you find it too light then you might want to step up to MX Natural white or MX Black for the extra heftiness."
72579,"It is completely up to you. Go to a shop, try out different keyboards, see which you like. I prefer blues for their nice click."
72580,"Unless your a pro gamer, i highly doubt you'd be able to notice the difference."
72581,You can buy a key switch sampler on Amazon. It has 6 different cherry MX switches for you to try so you can find your favorite
72582,Three only way to really tell the difference is to get a tester that comes with a bunch of different switches imo.
72583,I like browns. Love my pok3r
72584,"If you're new to mechanical keyboards or just want a neutral switch, I'd say MX Browns. They're a middle-ground between the linear ones and the uber-clicky ones.

As for what is the best switch, I'm sure you can dig up some in-depth analysis where people measured the microseconds it takes to activate a switch in rapid succession to determine the ""best"" switch. I think linear ones fit that criteria.

Outside the lab and in the real world, however, the decision between Blue/Brown/Red/Black/Fuschia is going to be 100% personal preference.

I personally like MX Blacks and MX Browns."
72585,"Blues are my personal favourite -  but if you don't like them clicky then go with Browns imo.


Personal preference but I can't stand reds. 

I like Cherry MX the best but gaterons are a close second."
72586,Blues masterrace where you people at...
72587,"May be a little late to comment. It really comes down to personal preference. No one switch is better for gaming. Buy a switch tester and experiment. Also, check out /r/MechanicalKeyboards for keyboard/switch recommendations."
72588,"Reds are quiet, blues are clicky, and browns are an in between so they are my favorite"
72589,"The ones that the user likes. 

For me, MX Blues are excellent."
72590,I game on reds and have played a bit on browns and didn't mind those either.
72591,"Browns are my choice for general use and gaming.  After trying several types of switches, these will be the ones I buy for any future keyboards.  After using old membrane keyboards during my 8-12 hour days, it always puts a little smile on my face to get home and use mine

I like blues for prolonged typing (several pages or more at a time) and showing off

Reds, well, I just didn't care for them.  I dunno why, they just didn't feel like a mechanical keyboard to me.  Others may love them, and that's great, but they weren't for me"
72592,"I like MX Greens, Clears or Zealios Purps."
72593,"For me, the Cherry MX Speed switches are great for gaming. It has a 1.2mm actuation point, has a shorter travel distance, and it is actually pretty good to type on (unless if you have heavy hands, that is). They are also not that loud if you value a bit of quietness as well.

For typing, I will recommend Cherry MX Blues as they are soft and the clack is just amazing. However, some mechanical keyboard pros recommend the Topre switches, though, they are quite expensive as of the time of writing."
72594,Do you guys recommend blue or brown more for a mix of typing and gaming?
72595,Definitely Browns for the best of both worlds.
72596,I can tolerate Blues but they always feel a little light to me. I've been wanting to get my hands on a board with MX Greens but they are hard to find.
72597,"Definitely Cherry MX Reds for any FPS gaming. It may seem weird, but not having that click every time you press WASD to strafe in Counter Strike does something for me (and most other people I talk to about this) subconsciously where I don't think about the button attached to the movement, I just move. 

For MMOs and MOBAs, I would assume having a bit of tactile click would be better. Reds are very very sensitive and there's no feedback at all, and you don't want to accidentally Chronosphere when you just hovered over the key and thought about it for a second! I'd prefer Browns in those games, as they're not as clicky as Blues."
72598,Browns are the best all around switch. Good for your fist mech keyboard
72599,"I have blues in my Das Keyboard Ultimate Model S. Honestly, unless you are an invested pro gamer who wants to tweak every fine detail of his gaming performance, the way the keys feel while typing is going to quickly become more important than gaming.

Having an actuation point at a certain spot can feel nice while wandering between WASD an 1-9, but having the keys feel good while rapidly typing hundreds of characters is far more valuable in my opinion. 

Again, this is assuming that you aren't an invested pro gamer who needs to max his performance in CS:GO or whatever."
72600,"I personally use Cherry MX Clears, and I love them to death!"
72601,Have Browns they are perfect. Blues are great as well.
72602,"To be honest, I would get whichever switch suits you. Be warned though, I would go for the tactile silent: the clicky ones sound like machine guns at night but you still want that tactile feel. If you want full stealth at night (membrane is best but there are ones where it's more like a USP-S instead of a machine gun) then you have to sacrifice the tactile feel (the bump when you press down on the key)"
72603,"Browns because if you live with others, blue switches will just annoy them :/"
72604,"I use Gateron browns, a Cherry MX clone. I enjoy the slight tactile bump they provide. I also enjoyed the quickness and responsiveness of my board with Cherry MX reds. As multiple people have stated, it's all a matter of preference. I suggest heading into an electronics store like Best Buy and play around with their floor samples. Or even get a switch tester."
72605,I have no idea what's inside my razer black widow but I like them
72606,"everyone will have different opinions here. the blue is okay for me,but i only use it type in the office,it's too noisy,haha"
72607,"maybe Kailh White BOX Switch is my favorite,clear click and long life"
72608,"I'll probably get shit on for this but I got the razer hybrid mechanical and rubber dome and it's perfect to me. Perfect amount of clickiness without being too much

Edit: yep, already got some downvotes. Good job promoting discussion and opinions guys"
72609,"There's nothing wrong with your choice if it works for you, it's just that those switches, and that keyboard, are inherently inferior to people who prefer mechanical stuff. Which is most people here I would assume."
72610,BROOWNNN
72611,Steelseries Omnipoint switches. Smoothest switches ever.
72612,"Zilent v2 @ 67g, really love the way the feel with the amount of force and tactility while being quiet enough for the office. Only downside for me was price and time lubing, but I didn't join r/mk to be rational with a keeb."
72613,Cherry mx blacks love the force it takes to press
72614,"capacitive buckling springs, feels like sex and with floss mod sounds even better"
72615,"Box Whites by far, they're light and crisp and just really satisfying for me to type on. Yes I've tried Jades and Navies but the Box White to me has a much better typing experience.

I think that might change soon though, I have Holy Pandas, 67g V2 Zealios, and some Aqua Zilents waiting to go in boards that aren't built yet, just trying them on a tester feels nice but I won't really know until I can try typing on them for a while"
72616,"Box whites/pinks are what you’d want cherry blues to be. An upgrade in every way, and a decidedly ‘delicate’ feel. 

Better sound. Smoother. Crisper click event. Just better. 

I like them a ton (I put them above any other cherry mount click switch, including other boxes, and perhaps tied with SMK 2nd gen Blues). 

Perhaps only some alps clickies or model f/m spring feel better."
72617,Zilents V2 62g
72618,"Right now, Kailh Box Navy since they have a nice actuation point (I used to use MX Blacks; but didn't really want to stay with linear switches, so 60g feels right to me) and they have a hefty 90g bottom out. They feel quite crisp and smooth out of the box (no pun intended) and they're loud as fuck.     

Definitely not something I'd use if I were in an office or classroom or if I had someone sleeping nearby but damn do I find them satisfying to press.      

I haven't tried any of the more boutique switches, my reasoning is ignorance is bliss. Box Navies are something like $3.50 per 10 while these more boutique switches are like $5 - $10 per 10. Maybe I'll change up the switches for my next keyboard build (I'm considering an ortho like the Planck) but for now I'm content with the Box Navy switches."
72619,"I have all the mice you mentioned with the exception of finalmouse/ Air 58 and you are pretty much spot on about them. My hand size is 20 x10.5 and I prefer the Xtrfy M4 the most followed by the Endgame XM1 v2 and maybe the G703/ G pro Wireless after them.

My least favorite by far is the Razer Viper/ Viper ultimate. To me it's way too flat and very uncomfortable. I was thinking about trying the Finalmouse Capetown but after your review I'll pass on that now."
72620,"Yeah not a huge fan of the UL2, not with 20x10.5. It’s soooooo small and the infinity skins are not it for me. Glad you had similar experiences"
72621,I love the m4 but the aggressive curve makes the bottom of my thumb hurt even after 2 weeks of us. My aim is v good with it. When I went back to ec1 the pain went away instantly.
72622,"Lots of comparisons and practical stuff,  was a good read."
72623,Thank you very much I appreciate it
72624,Have you considered getting the [Air58 clone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0843GX2LR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Wr4mEbG8VNWXY)? I'd love to see a comparison on those two.
72625,Didn’t even know that existed. Thanks for the recommendation that sounds like a good idea

72627,"Awesome write-up! I didn't realize you were nock till the end. I subbed to your yt a while back aha. Looking forward to that stardust review.

What's your ranking for m1/2 clicks between gpw, air58, xm1, ul2?"
72628,"Air58/UL2, XM1, then GPW. But all very good. Thanks for the sub man I appreciate it. Thought I’d do a write-up to switch up the medium a think through the same stuff in a different way. Looking forward to getting the hati in and taking a look. Long overdue."
72629,When you do receive and review it could you compare the clicks and buttons as well? I've been curious since they switched off ttc and people claim the 10/20mil omrons feel crispier than the 50m
72630,"Yeah I imagine they would, I definitely will. I hope they’re a bit crispier than the ones on my early Skoll."
72631,"IMO UL2 is one of the best looking mouse out there, off-white looks very good and I kinda like the orange too. I dislike majority of  the ""gAmINg"" mice out there due RGB and ugly-ass logos. It feels like the whole PC gaming industry is around RGB and gAmING GamING gaAMiNG... I'd rather see minimalistic designs combined with premium materials."
72632,However the abnormal high price tag makes it branded as a gaming piece immediately. People swearing about Razers products being overpriced so the UL2 is no excecption either.
72633,"I bough mine for 70€. Had been one week in use so not bad price at all. It is made for gaming no doubt, but it does not yell GAMING GAMING GAMING with RGB nonsense and thinks like that IMO."
72634,"Hahaha totally fair, I go back and forth on it. Aesthetic is a very subjective category. My experience with it was just that it was too small for my hand and like I said, I was annoyed that the infinity skins weren’t more functional but probably more annoyed at myself for buying a mouse that was way too small for my hand. At this point I’m just kind of making a meme of it. Like I said, def a good addition to the market for people with small hands."
72635,"Agreed and I feel you. Stickers or ""infitity skins"" are not acceptable on a 120 € product. If I would need to add stickers to my mouse to be able to hold it properly, then I would rahter just get a new mouse that fits me better."
72636,Did you feel any M1/M2 wobble on the XM1 (especially when holding them down)?
72637,"No wobble, but as many have noted, when you click hard/aggro (not that hard really, firmly) it does sound a little on the hollow side. Doesn’t bother me with headphones on, but it’s notable. No wobble as far as I can tell though"
72638,I won't lie I find it very amusing when I hear people describe the XM1 as sounding hollow. It is! I don't think it has under top shell reinforcements.
72639,For sure. Just something to note
72640,Appreciate your in-depth reviews!
72641,Thanks so much. I’d like to go more in-depth but I feel like Bearded Bob and BadSeed Tech and RJN sorta cover that stuff and sometimes people are just looking for honest reviews and comparisons from the perspective of an average consumer.
72642,I'm glad someone else appreciates some nice feet
72643,Lmao 👀
72644,were you able to palm claw the xm1? i currently own the model o and it feels way too narrow and flat for me. i get cramps on my pinky and ring finger if i game for really long. cant seem to palm the mouse as well. i have similar hand sizes 20x10. i am currently considering the model d and roccat kain 120. but your review has got me reconsidering the endgame xm1 even though ive been told that it would be too small for my grip style. i used to forcefully palm a kana which was like a fk2 clone so idk. fingertip clawed an office mouse in my early gaming days as well.
72645,"I’m not sure about palm clawing, it’s so low-profile it’s really better for an out and out claw grip esp at 20x10, but the hump is towards the rear and can support the base of your palm a bit if that’s how you hybrid. 

I had a similar experience with the Model-O though, it felt so big that I should palm it but it wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Air58 in that respect so I ended up in a hybrid but I didn’t love it. The Model-D is much more comfortable for a palm grip.

On the XM1 I’d say the sides are thin because of its low-profile but I have mine just in front of and just behind the midpoint of the mouse on the right hand side, respectively.

Sorry I can’t be more help, I know making the call can be tough. I’d say of the options as far as I’m familiar, Model-D for palm, XM1 for claw. I think the XM1 is the better mouse but I’d feel bad if I recommended something that wound up being too small for your grip preference."
72647,Logitech nailed it with the GPW. Hopefully the switches hold up.
72649,Awesome to hear. Fingers crossed.
72650,"Good luck, I gave up on the mouse after the fifth RMA with the double clicking occuring within a week each time."
72651,Damn sorry to hear that. Never a fun experience
72652,"After reading so many great reviews i decided to order my own XM1 with the white colorway. I was swapping mices like crazy. I'm a little woried because i didn't like S1 at all, I had S2 too it was way better than S1 but still couldn't feel that ""ENDGAME-feeling"". Now i'm daily driving a EC2-B but i'm way worse with ergonomic mouse, anyway thank you very much for that review!"
72653,"Thanks for your feedback, hope you like the XM1. If not, I’m sure you can flip it without taking a loss. Very hot mouse rn and for good reason."
72654,My hand size is around 19-19.5/9-9.5 so i have hope that will be my endgame mouse :D
72655,Where can I get one? Amazon is out of stock
72656,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Its just written so natural with expressing your actual feelings rather than acting censored and polite.

And the written about the UL2 - this just killed me , i was actually laughing damn hard.

>If you have smaller hands and you're colorblind

Like , lmao... Legend!

I relate to everything written about FM , terrible company. Great shape. I use Scream mainly for the shape and that i found 2 for 40$ each. The shape is good very good. Cons : extremely slippery , with my sweaty hands its hard to find good grip for 1min> without readjusting my grip , awful feets , awful cable , too much post-travel , on both copies , the wheel encoder actuates itself like its ""stuck"" - annoying ingame. 

The XM1 is very interesting. I remember at the beginning it wanst getting any attention and infact the few people that tested it , didnt liked it. And out of nowhere it became the most popular and recommended mouse for claw - damn impressive. Im still waiting for the white one to arrive in my country. Sounds too good to be true , but i'll absolutely give it a shot , especially with this new UV coating that Roccat uses - by far the best coating i've touched!

Just checked your channel too , deserved sub. Nice reviews."
72657,Hey thanks so much I appreciate it. Hope your XM1 gets there soon and that it lives up to the hype. The coating is super nice you’re right
72658,"Very nice review, great read. It has great humor which makes it easy and fun to read.

I don't own all mice you mentioned, but I agree on many things you've said. I also would recommend the XM1 to almost any type of claw. This mouse is seriously the best mouse I have ever used for said grip.

People need to take into account a mouse works best with X grip. I play pure fingertip grip, so unlike your opinion, I do like small and ultra light weight mice. At 19x9.5cm I like the Model O-. I'd probably like the UL2 too (maybe even more since it feels smaller in hand I've read).

Hoping for that XM1 mini or a XM mouse with a bigger hump to use knuckle claw with!"
72659,"Yeah if you like small mice the UL2 would be good, I was obv hyperbolically harsh on it but like I said, it’s basically a 60% clone of the Air58 with a better scroll wheel and no paint job"
72660,"I love how much effort you've put into this! These detailed write-ups really do a lot to help everybody else make an informed decision when buying a new mouse, so thanks a lot my friend. 

Also you've definitely piqued my interest in the xm1, I'll be trying that one out for sure"
72661,"Thanks for the kind words, glad you found it useful"
72662,Would love to see you pick up an MM710/711 and add your opinion of that to the mix (if you get a good one). Currently my main due to size / shape / weight
72663,"Yeah I’ve been thinking about it. The 711 I’ve heard better things about than the original release of the 710, just worried it might be too small"
72664,"It might be, but I've seen people with bigger hands enjoy it too - all preference depending on grips"
72665,For sure for sure
72666,Fantastic read. I pretty much agree with everything you said. Especially about the Viper.
72667,Thanks so much for reading
72668,"Awesome review dude. Totally agree on those I've tried. But what's your main? Air 58? GPW? XM1?

Either you have a main or you don't and you just use them when you feel like it. lol"
72669,"Yeah that’s fair. It was the Air58. Then the GPW. Then back the the Air58, kinda switched between the two depending on the day. And now the XM1 for the past few weeks. So..."
72670,"Got it!.... Not hating though, I know how it is and how often we all change mains every now and then. Just curious :)

I so want to try the XM1 but at the same time, when will I stop this madness? SEND HELP!"
72671,"That was a good read and I couldn't agree more with the point, that it's absurd that $50 for a mouse is considered cheap."
72672,For sure. Tough times. Good that not everything is $100+
72673,"Actual thoughtful writing vs typical single photo of a mouse with the caption of ""endgame.""

Sir, have an upvote!

Thoughtful humour and using full sentences and punctuation are further pluses in my book!"
72674,"Lmao thank you, I did my best. Might’ve gotten a little tired toward the end but it’s a solid overview of my experiences with the mice."
72675,"Hey man, question about palming the XM1, how is it? I currently am palming a viper ultimate but want a little bigger hump"
72676,"It's a very comfortable mouse for hybrid claw/palm, but I highly suggest an ergo mouse if you full palm. You can full palm the mouse, but it would sure take some getting use to, surely a lot easier if your hands are medium or smaller."
72677,"I’ve used the Hati, M4, Model O, Model D, GPW, and Viper ultimate, model D was nice but too big for my hand.... not sure if I should try the skoll or not but I’ve been very intrigued by the update XM1"
72678,How’d you feel about the m4? Too aggressive of a shape?
72679,"Shape wasn’t too bad, I just placed my thumb too far below the side buttons so it was kind of a pain to reach up for them, it was also kinda weird to pick up to place back in the middle of my pad"
72680,Interesting. And you didn’t love the GPW?
72681,"I didn’t like the shape for some reason, I couldn’t get comfortable on it day to day. It was like every time I used it my grip felt different, probably because it is just straight and doesn’t have much curves to it like the viper.... if the viper had a bigger hump and was slightly wider, it would probably be endgame for me"
72682,"Interesting. I just hesitate to recommend the XM1 for a palm grip because it’s so low profile. The hump isn’t very big but it is a bit closer to the back of the mouse. It is a great mouse but my recommendation would be to hybrid grip at a medium hand size, not sure if that’s what you’re looking for"
72683,"Not sure, I ordered a skoll and cancelled it before it got here 😂 wish I had bigger hands bc I did love the model D"
72684,Model-D is a solid mouse. Wish I could be of more help haha. Maybe wait/hope for the Model D-?
72685,There's no point to try the skoll if you felt the Model D was too big for your hands. XM1 is worth to try once for almost anyone who is a gamer.
72686,"I’m just worried about ordering it then having it not be comfortable for palm you know, cause there isn’t like a resale value so I’d like 100% lose money"
72687,My hands are about medium size
72688,FYI you can’t write off full price of the mouse
72689,"(Is a joke, I work in finance)"
72690,Tell us what you think on the hati.
72691,Will do for sure
72692,look at this dude shitting on the finalmouse ultralight 2 because he's probably trying to palm it like a pleb
72693,Lmao I just have big hands my dude. Don’t take it personally. It’s tiny. Couldn’t palm it if I tried
72694,"the point is that it's not made for palming at all, i myself probably couldn't palm it, but the mouse is probably the best mouse possible for fingertip gripping"
72695,"Your point was very explicitly that I was probably trying to palm it like an idiot, and my point was that it's just too small for my hand."
72696,"XM1 is the goat.

but for reviews man, you should really separate your personal bias for a company and just look at the product. In my opinion anyway.

XM1 is also my last mouse for a long time now, after buying and trying many mice. I sold all my mice recently, the search came to an end =)"
72697,"Glad to hear you’re happy with the XM1, I am too. I think I did separate my bias against FinalMouse from the review, like I said I love the Air58 (other than the scroll wheel) and I had a bad experience with the UL2 but for people with smaller hands it’s probably a welcome addition. The rest was just jokes. I do think they’re a shitty company though"
72698,"so many review in one go!

XD

they are quite good.

the pictures are really nice.

good job."
72699,Thank you so much
72700,"Since you really put some time and effort into this long post, I will waste 2 minutes to destroy it.

The reason you ‘can’t get enough‘ is because you blame your lack of skill on a piece of equipment. The scary part isn’t just that you are a dumbass but the fact that you aren’t going to find your ‘endgame’ at all.

I buy most POPULAR mice to find MY ‘endgame’. Do you understand the stupidity of your thinking?
Not to mention that these mice are only popular on this sub where 95% of people are exact idiots like you.

I’m not gonna bother replying to your ‘reviews’ because I honestly cannot call any of that garbage a review."
72701,Damn dude I hope whatever’s wrong gets better. Tomorrow’s another day.
72702,"I'd say GPX, but there are mice coming out soon to match it's weight with arguably better shapes."
72703,Any mice in particular to look out for?
72704,"MM731 (as my flair states), Gamebitions Orbit, Razer Orochi V2, Origin One X, and a few others (these are off the top of my head). I made an upcoming mice thread on this sub that has some more."
72705,"Check his flair.

Then join the room."
72706,Just a quick bit of research and I think I may also join this waiting room.
72707,"$90 for a 60g wireless mouse with optical switches and no holes sounds almost too good to be true. If the build quality isn't trash, and the wireless performance is flawless, this could be a game changer."
72708,optical switches are not a good thing what
72709,"I disagree. The number one reason why I've thrown away/RMAd mice is because the switches developed issues.

Optical switches might not ""feel"" as nice, but that's a trade-off I'm willing to make for better durability."
72710,Understandable.  What mice from the ones listed above are we talking about anyways.
72711,Looks like you're in the wrong room
72712,"Definitely not a shape I would ever use, but the gamebitions mouse has some good internal specs (Kailh switches, 3370 sensor, good battery).

I've never owned a wireless mouse bc all the shapes I like are wired... maybe someday though."
72713,"GPX is way too expensive for what it is imo. It’s a good mouse, but the value is insane in a bad way. 150$ for a mouse with omron 20m’s, passable side buttons, a scroll wheel button that’s very hard to press (some people like that, but I don’t), very thin stock feet with poor longevity and no replacements included, and it uses micro usb. Sure, these aren’t terrible flaws, especially the micro USB isn’t THAT big of a deal since you rarely need to charge it, but if I pay 150$ for a mouse I expect better features than that. I expect near-perfection for that amount of money.

After I just wrote that paragraph I realized that OP mentioned “disregarding money” but I spent time writing that rant and I’ll be damned if no one reads it lmao. The rest of my comment will ignore price!

If you want the lightest wireless gaming mouse on the market with good build quality and a shape that anyone can use, then yes the GPX is exactly that, but for me that’s not all that’s needed for a mouse to be “the best” imo. 

Some mice like the XM1r and the Pulsefire haste have such good cables that it really doesn’t matter that they aren’t wireless, and they have better clicks, better side buttons, better stock  feet with replacements included, better scroll wheel, and a shape that won’t be as safe, but that can be the best for someone. Safe shapes are good for everyone, which is a good thing for people who don’t want to try a million mice, but they’re rarely the best for anyone. 

If you ignore price, then paracording the mouse is also free correct? If that’s the case, my top 5 in no particular order consists of the following:

M42, Viper mini, Pulsefire Haste, XM1r and Ducky Feather (ducky feather is my least favourite out of the 5 though).

I’ve tried the GPW and quite a few other wireless mice, and while it’s nice to have a wireless mouse, I value other features over wireless that the GPW lacks. 

I’m hoping to get my hands on a zygen np01s later this month, it might dethrone the ducky feather and join my top 5!"
72714,Depends but I guess the best of the best have to be the RVU or GPX
72715,"*Depends but I guess*

*The best of the best have to*

*Be the RVU or GPX*

72718,"GPX. Unless you really hate the shape or the price is too high for you, there isn't a better mouse on the market right now.

RVU is significantly heavier.

MOW is heavier, has holes, and has a questionable sensor (I'm not sure if they've fixed the angle snapping yet or not)."
72719,RVU
72720,"probably the GPX but I could see arguments for others

the upcoming final mouse could potentially be the new top dog though too. Also if you include 3D printed wireless mods then it all depends on what shape you like best."
72721,"Haven't heard of that one before, is it a limited run they're making or something?"
72722,Usual limited run nonsense.
72723,"If we're talking spec-wise it's gpx for sure, but the shape is not for everyone."
72724,"I would say the Razet Viper Ultimate( on white, rose or cyberpunk edition since those are the ones with v2 switches) It's only 74g and its shell its actually very robust for my taste(I usually rage quit after 3 hours of csgo and I throw or hit or smash my stuff)My RVU has gone trhough my whole setup room flying and ending smashed in the wall but it still works and looks as good as new, and well, 74g, a top tier sensor and wireless, its what ur looking for, and plus, almost every mercury white and rose quartz includes a charging dock as u may know"
72725,"Starlight-12 if you get one, I like the finalmeme shape."
72726,Probably the new Finalmouse
72727,Maybe the Model O Wireless? Idk but the BAMF sensor on that thing coupled with it's pretty light weight seems like a good pair for fps gaming.
72728,"GPX is impressive but clicks and stock feet suck, also shape is meh.

RVU has a better shape but i can't ever get used to the optical switches, even V2.

IMHO the best available right now is the Xenics Titan GX Air Wireless: great shape (S2 clone), great build, same weight as RVU and perfectly balanced, 3370, good stock feet (Arc2) and amazing clicks. I genuinely can't find a fault with this mouse"
72729,Just backorder the Model O. You won’t regret. I still have to use my G502 while I wait for mine to come in. But all I know is that it will be worth it..
72730,"under 70g hmmm no sorry most gaming mouses are around 80g and up

this is why the model o is so interesting.

madcatz is trying to make lighter mouses but dunno about the quality of the new lineup.

logitech has the gpro wireless the g203 and g305

roccat has some light mouses too and razer has the abyssus."
72731,"There are very few under 70 grams, and even fewer that are actually reasonable as purchases (which excludes Finalmouse's offerings). If you want it to be under 70g and can't get a Model O (or wait for the new Coolermaster MM710 to come out), you could get a G305, and have a honeycomb battery cover, shell, and mouse buttons printed by a 3D printing service. You could get to under 70 grams, and have wireless on top of that.

On top of that...you could just get any decently lightweight mouse and drill the fuck out of its shell (such as the G Pro Wireless or something) but...I wouldn't *personally* do that, because it permanently ruins the mouse."
72732,X lite.
72733,Oooo all three of those are excellent.
72734,"Model D and X lite are way safer shapes then the Origin, but they are all pretty damn good."
72735,do you think the Xlite is better than the OOX for smaller hands? currently maining the Model D- Handsize 17.5x9 cm hands
72736,"I can't say which one's best for you, but the OOX could either be a bit too small for your hands, or just about the perfect shape. The Xlite is a bit bigger then your d-, but it's a really safe shape."
72737,By any chance do you know if d- is smaller than oox? I've been using the rtings tool but they don't have oox yet. Thanks in advance.
72738,"It's quite a different shape, so it's hard to say exactly.
The OOX feels more curved and smaller at the grip, but the hump is a bit bigger and more towards the back."
72739,"Oooh I get what you're saying. Honestly I'm just waiting for a good small wireless ergo. At this point I'm holding out for puc v2, model d- wireless. Just gonna stick with my orochi v2 until one of them comes out.

Thank you! ♥"
72740,G703 and Deathadder are in that price range as well.
72741,If the prime wireless or kpa were cheaper id say one of the 2 but the pulsar is probably the best deal for a good ergo wireless that u can get. Its built better thsn the origin imo
72742,A lot of people like the deluxe for a budget wireless mouse. Maybe the g305 could be good or fantech Helios (wireless S2).
72743,Wait a little for the MM731?
72744,"Get the Delux M800DB 3355. 
The mouse is by far the best for its price and comes with a nice shape.
Maybe invest in some grip tape for the sides."
72745,Origin one x
72747,Every other mouse will just be disappointing compared to the GPX in terms of battery life and build quality. If the GPX is comfortable just stick with it.
72748,"If you like low profile claw mice, the viper ultimate and g305 are great choices. Other than that the GPW is the only other lightweight wireless."
72749,Pricey but the [Logitech G Pro Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Esports-Performance/dp/B07GCKQD77) is a very nice lightweight wireless mouse.
72750,"Wireless mice are really great these days. I just switched to wireless and not gonna go back to wired anytime soon.
There are few on the market worth buying and I guess logitech leads the way.
There is g pro, g305, g703 and razor viper ultimate.
Depend on what's your grip type/hand size you have to decide for your self which one suits you best."
72751,Razer Viper Ultimate is the best money  can buy in terms of wireless mice and tech. It is better than GPW because many GPW are known to develop double click issues. Razer Viper Ultimate will never develop those issues because it uses optical switches for m1 and m2. Plus the coating on the RVU offer better grip than the coating of the GPW.
72752,"Well the GPW has sturdy build and great quality, only issue are the switches. The VPU has really dodgy QC and both my units I’ve had had mushy clicks like crazy."
72753,"My GPW has m1 and m2 lateral movement and when pressing m2 hard sometimes m1 would scratch the side of m2. Also it developed double clicking issues in a matter of weeks and when i had sweaty hands it felt really slippery. On top of all that it also had very subtle steps on the scroll wheel to the point that i could not use the scroll wheel to bunny hop in csgo or change weapons in COD MW. 
The VPU has light switches which are indeed different feeling than the GPW switches but at least they do not double click and the QC is great so far at least in my copy of it."
72754,"QC is great? Just look in this sub, a lot of ppl have shitty units, QC means quality CONTROL you just had a lot of luck with the VPU and lot of bad luck with the GPW which is like a tank for most ppl besides the switches (which can be easily replaced and the customer support at Logitech is top tier. Razer is dog shit, took literally two month to replace my mouse and only because Razer Right stepped in and made people do their job(thanks again for that though <3))"
72755,"My experience is the exact opposite from yours. I live in EU and logitech support here is dog shit. They make you jump through hoops to RMA a defective unit while Razer simply asks you for the serial number of the product. A lot of people here also complain about GPW scroll wheel and the switches which obviously have a problem. That being said i might have been lucky with my VPU but all my friends also got lucky with their? And all of us got unlucky at least 2 times each with the GPW? 
It's a bit weird if you ask me. To each their own i guess, but imo the VPU is much better than GPW."
72756,"Mate I am from Germany and it took seriously two months to replace a VPU and a simple email
Exchange to get a new GPW. But yea to each their own, personally razer is dead to me after that experience"
72757,I am from Greece and they did not answer to my email for a month and then it took another month to the process moving. To each their own. I am not touching another Logitech product until they address the switch issues they have with their models.
72758,"Hmm, at the moment most lightweight mice (<80 grams) are wired. There might be several new wireless lightweights coming out this year, Wireless Hati, GPW X, Wireless Finalmouse. Current options are obviously Viper U and the GPW. Both of those are expensive though, and I own neither so others could probably be more informative. The GPW does have time on its side though, and the only issue people report consistantly is double clicks.

I don't know what I would do if I were you, the Model O would probably be a less expensive way to experience a lightweight ambi mouse. Their new cable looks fantastic so I'd make sure to get a current unit. So yeah, unless you're in a rush to try wireless tech, I'd try a wired mouse that's vastly different from the DA, just so you know what kind of shape and weight you like."
72759,"Yeah I think looking at the prices I'll get more value by saving $75 or so on a wired mouse. The viper wired is actually the same price as the model o in aus right now, is that a better deal?"
72760,"It just depends on what you value. Model O is holes, lighter, good stock skates, meh history with button wobble. Viper is no holes, average dyed skates, slightly heavier, optical switches with no debounce time. Idk which is better tbh."
72761,Guess I'll just have to see whichevers cheaper if they're really similar. Thanks for the help
72762,"Good luck man, hopefully you find something that works, also don't be afraid to hold the new shapes in new ways. I used to use a Deathadder and now I'm on an ambi mouse. It wasn't a  huge change for me honestly but I hold the mouse in Pincer Claw instead of normal Palm like I had before."
72763,"The Logitech G305 might work. It's great in fingertip and wireless. If you swap the AA battery for a AAA lithium with a converter you can get it to around 84 grams and still get around 2 months of play form one battery.   


I searched for G Pro Wireless prices in Aus and the lowest historical price I saw was around  $165 so that may be an option too. If you take out the bottom plate on that you can get it to 77g. 

Unless the Razer Viper Ultimate goes down in price, those are pretty much the only solid wireless options at the moment."
72764,"Yeah ok will have a look. G pro wireless goes on sale occasionally so I'll try that but viper ultimate is newer and I haven't seen it go down, otherwise I would go for that. I'll check out the g305 as well, thanks for the tips"
72765,No worries. Good luck!
72766,+1 for the g305 with a triple a mod. I'm loving mine
72767,What is your hand size? Please measure from bottom of the palm to the top of your middle finger and from your thumb to the opposite side of your palm.
72768,Will do
72769,It's about 17 by 9.5 cm
72770,"The FK2-B and the model o- are the purest fingertip mice that fit your grip and hand size. I would go for the model o- if you want something extremely light weight and small, while the fk2-b would fit you if you want something a bit larger but still small with a 82 gram weight.

Also the model o- is much cheaper and has better clicks, cables, and feet."
72771,"Ok sounds good, I wasn't actually sure whether to get the model o or o- . Thanks"
72772,"If you don’t buy directly from glorious, make sure it’s the newer batch. They come with a much better cable."
72773,Yeah I've seen that about the right angle thing and will definitely buy from glorious

But if you have a little more money check out the upcoming version of the model o (It should be 58g) or the cooler master mm710 (52g) or maybe you should try the model o (that for me works well having palm grip and is 67g ) all of these are at almost 50 dollars/euros

If you want the cooler master you have to preorder it from amazon.com)"
72796,Depends on your budget
72797,"The lightest budget (i.e. less than 30$) mouse I know is the Gigabyte Aorus M2 (76g), followed by the Nixeus Revel (82g). EVGA Torq X5 is pretty light too (83g)."
72798,"yea ur only hope is the previous ultralights or the Model D which isnt released yet, and those arent guaranteed to fit either as the Skoll is pretty damn big. 

might as well just adjust ur grip to fit smaller mice if neither of those will work"
72799,":(

&#x200B;

I was afraid this would be the case. Was hoping there was maybe some boutique brand that made something"
72800,"Same hand size

Most comfy - g403 and intellimouse
Best lightweight - Skoll (i also hate the coating but grip stickers helps a bit).
Model O (glossy) - really good, needed some time to adjust to the shape.
MM710- had good resaults but my hand is too wide so hurts after a while."
72801,I’m in the same boat. Waiting on model d reviews to go with that or just bite the bullet and go buy another ec1 with the new coating
72802,"You might would love an Ultralight Pro, but you’d need to find a used one. You can check on r/mousemarket for generally the lowest prices outside of Facebook/craigslist

Finalmouse’s shape leaves the most room on the sides of any lightweight mouse. The model o makes my hand cramp but the ultralight is very comfortable. 

Only problem is it’s ambi not ergo."
72803,For now model O (fk1 shape) its 70 grams not really that much lightweight but still lighter than fk1/s1
72804,model d soon maybe the skoll and hati will be to small.
72805,"- [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for ease of use and support
- [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) if you a want Windows-like UI and Ubuntu compatability
- [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) if you like the idea of a commercially back project
- [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) if you want a crash course on Linux systems as a whole

Starting from the top, Ubuntu and Mint (and any other Ubuntu based distro) will get you up on your feet and developing in Linux the fastest. Fedora is backed by Red Hat Linux, which is a commercial company and has a significant presence in enterprise, so that familiarity may be more beneficial if that's the kind of work you're going into. Arch is pain, but from that pain you'll learn a lot about *how* linux systems work and how to fix them."
72806,"A relevant advantage of Fedora is that it has a focus on developer's tools. A couple of ""yum groupinstall ..."" will bring up a programming environment for the popular enterprise languages.

Having said that, the GNOME3 user interface is a long way from Windows and Ubuntu's always-present menu is a great help for beginners.

Starting with a VM is a good idea, but getting rid of the VM and installing on the bare metal is when the real learning starts."
72807,"Despite its difference, I've found that most people adapt to the Gnome interface remarkably well. I think Unity is equally strange to to most - but they're both quite intuitive interfaces once you get the basics.

Also, thanks for the Fedora info. Outside of its connection to RHEL and Gnome I don't know much about it."
72808,"That's not really a relative advantage, since a couple of ""apt-get install ..."" will do the same thing on Ubuntu or Debian."
72809,"So alot of people are going to recommend Ubuntu. Which is a fantastic OS and a great newbie friendly system.

But you have experience with computers and programming and I recommend you just say fuck it and dive in to the deep end. Install Arch Linux....in a virtual machine (To save your sanity).

Follow this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide

You will probably fuck up. Several times. You will probably do several restarts. You will probably decide that you have no desire to keep up with Arch's bullshit and go down to ubuntu later on. But you WILL learn and get alot of skills in the process.

But if you dont go this route. No biggie. You'll still learn and have some fun. 

A few pointers though:

-A distro (Distribution) is a term for a Linux Operating System. Since Linux OS's are all really similar it makes more sense to use a separate term. Think of Linux as a community of programs. A Distro is a collection of different programs. (For example: Ubuntu and Kubuntu are the exact same OS, but they include different Interfaces)

-Desktop Environment. Think of this as a mini distro within your distro. It's a collection of software that you interact with on the desktop. Including the interface itself. 

-Repos (Repositories). Linux has been using ""App Stores"" since before they were cool.....kinda. This will be your primary form of installing software. Generally software in a Distros repo has been tested and should work fine. 

-Package manager: The program that downloads from the repo, unpackages, and installs software. You update your system through the package manager also. Most are command line based but graphical versions are getting popular. 

So that's a few pointers that I can think of. Ask if your confused! And have fun!"
72810,"That's a great idea, I am fast learner. I don't want to try on VM, but I can install with my Windows right ?"
72811,"You can dual boot (you'll need to tweak a few things to get it working just right. But the arch wiki is amazing). I recommend the VM just because it makes it abit easier to get your bearings. But if you are ready for it, go for it."
72812,Twitch something? Like what? I think I have find some tutorial online.
72813,"The Arch install guide linked in the post above is ""some tutorial"", only Awesome."
72814,"Yes, you can install it in a separate partition no problem."
72815,if you're gonna go the masochist way why not go full on gentoo?
72816,Personal preference. I found Arch a much better learning tool than gentoo.
72817,"As a Gentoo and Arch user, I agree."
72818,"I disagree, Gentoo was amazing for learning (in my case), ran it for years. Granted I did start with Mandrake 7.0 a while back...equivalent nowadays would probably be (K)Ubuntu or something.

TL;DR: Arch"
72819,"i've tried getting into gentoo, but documentation never described the flags system well enough for me to understand how to use it correctly."
72820,"Pretty good advice, except the VM part.

It doesn't count if it isn't on real hardware. Nobody learns Linux using a fucking VM."
72821,Haha
72822,"No kidding. I don't know of a single person that has learned their Linux skills from VM use.

It needs some investment. Dual-booting is okay, but using only Linux and trying to get everything done on Linux is how people learn. An VM? No way."
