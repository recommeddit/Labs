65515,"Osan=Olleh


Robins=Verizon


Creech/Nellis= AT&T for Creech (it gets shit service on Nellis though) and Verizon for Nellis."
65516,I have had horrible luck with Verizon while on Nellis. The trunk for the area gets overloaded during daytime.
65517,The BX is a complete dead zone for AT&T though.

65519,When i was in tech school there I had sprint.... those were dark times
65520,"We've had Tmobile at Robins & Warren with no reception issues. Pay $50 a line for unlimited minutes, texting and 4G. They also give a military discount. Best part is we're month to month in case we move somewhere Tmobile isn't."
65521,"McGuire: AT&T or Verizon. T-Mobile and Sprint suck out in the sticks. That being said, if you live off base and dont mind missing out on signal at work, any work pretty well. Being between Philly and NYC help with that."
65522,"T-mobile, free data and text in Europe and even in other countries such as beautiful Afghanistan and many other frequented locations.  The service is really good in big cities and  across the CONUS as well."
65523,FE Warren - Verizon/ATT
65524,"but if you're in the missile complex... good fuckin' luck.

amirite?"
65525,"Columbus AFB - AT&T or Verizon

T-Mobile is starting to get decent service albeit very slowly."
65526,"T-Mobile is gearing up to do a massive upgrade of its network through 2015, converting all of its 2G towers to LTE towers."
65527,"Verizon seems the most popular in Little Rock

I personally have Tmobile, and while I like it, 3/4 of the base is a dead zone for it"
65528,Anyone know if you can get T-Mobile at JBER?
65529,"Not sure about JBER, but I spent time in Juneau and Fairbanks with T-Mobile. They don't have towers, so you don't get T-Mobile service. I believe they have a contract with GCI so you get their service, but I couldn't get any data transfer at all. I was stuck with phone calls and texts that often dropped or wouldn't send. I switched to AT&T."
65530,Born and raised Alaskan here. T-Mobile is non-existent. Go with either ATT or Alaska Communications (ACS). With ACS you can get a killer internet/cell/cable deal too
65531,Beale - verizon
65532,"Verizon sucked in the gold country dorms if you faced the golf course tho, from what I remembered."
65533,"Worked fine for me when I was in the dorms.  I think I was room 334 (faced golf course/street), never had any problems."
65534,Yea I was in 109 (110? idk they were right next to each other)...and if I didnt leave my phone in a particular place on my window i never got phone calls or texts on it unless i went outside
65535,Andersen- GTA or Docomo
65536,"[Cannon] - Plateau is the regional Telecomm/ISP here, and have pretty great coverage. They will be merging with AT&T though in about 6 months, plus AT&T will be putting up more towers in the surrounding area. So, if you will be PCS'ing here in that time frame, hold on to your AT&T device.

Verizon also has great coverage, but they will be #2 here once AT&T takes over Plateau."
65537,"Colorado Springs (USAFA, Peterson, Schriever, Cheyenne Mountain)

It's a mixture of AT&T and Verizon, some get by with T-Mobile, very few if any Sprint.

I personally used AT&T and rarely had calls drop other than 2 very specific spots on the way to Schriever on Hwy 94. Can anyone say Garbage Hill? lol"
65538,Goodfellow - 2 cans on a string.
65539,Data breach is inevitable these days.
65540,Verizon $$$$$$$$$$
65541,"It depends where you are. There are only 3 providers on the west coast, TMobile (bought sprint), Verizon, and ATT. I believe all other brands are MVNOs.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator"
65542,Not AT&T
65543,Why not
65544,Poor reception
65545,"Get a booster. AT&T is old Cingular, formerly Cellular One and has the widest coverage here. You personally just live in a dead zone."
65546,Google Fi
65547,"Not sure why people are down voting you. It's cheap and works really well. You get coverage from Tmo, sprint and US cellular, and there's no roaming - it just works wherever you are. I've been super happy with it."
65548,Where are you located? I get super spotty reception around SJ Airport. I even have Pixel 4 and still planning on switching.
65549,Mountain View. Commute between there and Palo Alto. You can usually find me all over the peninsula and I've only had good experiences.
65550,I work near the airport and never had issues on my Pixel 4XL on Fi.
65551,"😔 Damn, I guess I need to figure it out. Because I do like how cheap it is"
65552,">US cellular

Doesn't US cellular = Verizon and Tmobile?"
65553,"Maybe, but in 4+ years in California with Fi, I have never been connected to a US Cellular site.  Fi will not connect to Verizon towers as far as I know."
65555,"When I was with T-Mobile a few years back it definitely was. Throttled speeds, extra costs. Really just an excuse to fleece you for more money."
65556,"Calling ""long distance"" from your home phone used to cost an arm and a leg"
65558,"It's not the cell band, it's Apple. Even 5G doesn't work, despite both the phone and TMo supporting it. Voicemails are crappy, and WiFi calling completely unsupported.

Apple has privileged relationships with carriers, and Google is not one of them (I guess it comes down to money. Google doesn't sell iPhone as part as Fi deals, and Apple doesn't let them work on iPhones).

You're better off using TMo directly on iPhone."
65559,"Ah interesting, maybe that’s why I’ve had so many problems with google fi."
65560,"I switched from Verizon to Google Fi (when it was ""Project Fi"") and it's great, even interntionally."
65561,"What area are you in? I had sporradic issues when I lived in SF, which almost always wound up being that I was on Sprint, had to change to T-Mo with my switcher app. 

Now that I'm in upper east bay, if I'm not on T-Mo, I don't have shit for connection. Sprint is the literal worst network in the world around here. Also, I've been randomly connecting to some unknown network here, and Fi refuses to put a block on it. 

I'm kind of at my end with Fi. Once the Pixel 6 comes out, I'm going to be taking a hard reconsider."
65562,"Here here, Google Fi kicks ass. I worked as a field biologist for a while and it got great service in a bunch of remote areas in the bay area that I never expected (and my ATT work phone didn't). The hassle free international service is amazing, too. Spain, Morocco, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan... Didn't have to do a damn thing for my phone to work in those counties. Landed and got going."
65563,"I have google fi and the data is just horrendous if you’re travelling. Having said that I don’t know how it compares to others, but I would expect a good provider to not throttle “unlimited data” so quickly and to work well when travelling abroad. (Travelling in Europe was hard with google fi, it was just so freaking slow.)"
65564,I get super spotty reception in the east bay
65565,Verizon will be your best bet. And then to save just go to a provider who uses verizons network. Everything else is trash. TMobile is fine if you are only in a city
65566,Bruh Verizon sucks ass. They need to get more satellites or towers here.
65567,Doesn't mean they aren't your best bet haha
65568,Verizon by far.
65569,"I'm sitting here at my cousins in Fremont with 1 bar.  Verizon gives me so many problems in the mountains and while traveling I need to find a solution. 

I'm gonna research into Google fi"
65570,"> Verizon gives me so many problems in the mountains

Wait til you try to find some other coverage in the mountains. In a lot of remote places, Verizon is the only option."
65571,"Verizon is slow in the mountains

The others flat out dont work half the time."
65572,"AT&T is better than Google Fi, Google Fi has substantially worse performance outside of cities than AT&T and Verizon"
65573,"I switched from Verizon to Google fi, and my signal everywhere got noticeably worse.

Not worth switching back because I hate Verizon, but Verizon definitely had significantly better service for me."
65574,Rip everyone's butthole in the bay
65575,"I've been on Fi since summer 2016. It *is not* going to be better than Verizon. I've lived in SF for most of that time, now live in northern East Bay and if I'm not on T-Mo, the service is nearly useless. The fact that I have to manually switch to T-Mo so often is incredibly frustrating. 

Every time I'm  stuck looking for signal, the people in my group who invariably have signal are Verizon customers. I really dislike Verizon's tactics and prices, but at this point I will readily admit that they are the superior network in the Bay Area (and the mountains as well)."
65576,"Check out Mint Mobile. Same coverage as T-Mobile because they buy network capacity wholesale and resell it, but great pricing especially if you can’t have a family plan. Shouldn’t be affected by data breach since they do their own billing and all."
65577,Mint had their own data breach last month https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/mint-mobile-data-breach-compromises-customers-phone-numbers-and-personal-information-071321.html
65578,"That’s interesting! Didn’t know, thanks for sharing. I guess I wasn’t affected."
65579,"But who's the best protection from hacking?

AT&T just got hacked too. Verizon was hacked last year."
65580,prepaid. don't gotta give any sensitive info to the telecoms
65581,I've been relatively happy with Xfinity (which uses Verizon).
65582,I’m in Oakland and Verizon has never given me any problems throughout East Bay or in the city.
65583,Verizon hands down
65584,I have Xfinity/Verizon in Livermore and it is absolutely terrible in the triangle between downtown/home depot/Lowe’s. Been considering switching providers
65586,Livermore is weird because Verizon either works perfectly or it’s completely dead
65587,Consumer cellular is inexpensive and has good coverage. I've been a customer for about five years.
65588,Verizon for sure T-Mobile's not bad they're all pretty good. You have to know the history of all these companies Verizon comes from Cellular One which turned into airtouch which turned in Pacific Bell and then Verizon I believe
65589,"> they're all pretty good.

Sounds like you've never had Sprint."
65590,"T-mobile.  

The data breach has already been done and I'm sure they had a long meeting about making it more secure.  Hackers are probably trying to hack other companies now so why switch now?"
65591,metro
65592,That's owned by T-Mobile.
65593,You get what you pay
65595,Apple phones are pretty good all things considered
65596,"At least in the South Bay, ATT has been good for me. My parents have Verizon, which typically has better signal wherever we go north, especially San Francisco. However, just annecdotally ATT seems to have better latency."
65597,"https://m.slashdot.org/story/389293

Looks like att lost their customer data as well."
65598,"At this point, they are about the same. All three have 600/700Mhz bandwidth.  What you need to do is to personally test out service at places you use the most, e. g. home, work, etc.

Hopefully at least one works"
65599,Depends on the locations you frequent.  ATT had the best signal at my house in Oakland and in SSF where I worked but there were some dead spots elsewhere.  Verizon seemed pretty good outside of the 2 areas I found myself frequently.
65600,My Verizon works well except going north up in Mendocino County.  My husband's T-Mobile has worked everywhere consistently.
65601,I switched to xfinity from Verizon and I couldn’t be happier. Much better service inside my house and I’m paying 1/3 what I did with Verizon. I’m in The tri valley
65602,"...dude, Xfinity Mobile is an MVNO that runs on Verizon's network."
65603,That’s crazy because with Verizon every time I got a call I’d have to run outside for people to be able to hear me at all. The day I switched it was fixed.
65604,probably WiFi calling
65605,"I also upgraded from a 10 to a 12, that probably had a lot to do with it. My house has always been a bit of a dead zone with multiple carriers, dating back to the old Nextel days"
65606,"Funny enough, we switched from Xfinity to T-Mobile because of our data usage and the fact we had some spotty coverage in our neighborhood.

FYI, I would only recommend Xfinity if you have Xfinity internet/tv. Then they waive the $20 access line."
65607,Every company has had a data breach at one point. I just want to know which provider is best for iPhones.
65608,"For coverage/speed/cost, Verizon prepaid. There are currently Verizon prepaid dealers on eBay offering the exclusive $60 ($55 with autopay) prepaid unlimited plan like this one: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Verizon-Wireless-Unlimited-Sim-Card-4G-LTE-with-First-Month-60-plan-for-Free/123455906958?epid=530089359&hash=item1cbe8ba48e plus they give you a free sim and the first month is discounted even further. And for further savings, if you buy eBay refill cards it will be roughly $40/mo out of pocket."
65609,How is priority and roaming Vs postpaid and Vs Boom Mobile?
65610,"So if I am already a Verizon customer, can I switch to this?  Can I keep my same phone number?"
65611,You would have to port out and port back.
65612,How is that plan exclusive? This comment isn’t meant to be rude btw
65613,Exclusive to prepaid dealers.
65614,"I'm currently on the $45 a month plan. If I call them and upgrade, afterwards could I buy the prepaid cards for $25?"
65615,"You can’t upgrade to the $55 unlimited plan, it has to be a new account. You can port out, open a new account and port back. And yes you can use the refills."
65616,Sweet.  Thanks!
65617,Teltik is nice if you're ok with t-mobile service.
65618,"Loving Teltik so far on the $40/month plan. 

When I signed up, they offered $10/month off for the first three months as well. Think I saw that promo was still a thing so $33.50 has been my bill for the first few months.

I’m actually not a huge data user, so I think I’ll just drop to the $30 plan when this third month is over."
65619,"Same. Don't forget, you're eligible for tmobile Tuesday as well"
65620,"I did. Thanks for the reminder! 

I actually installed it, but then had to restore my phone, and I guess that install wasn't backed up. Just re-installed today."
65621,I had them for a while and loved them. I just got back on my parents verizon plan.
65622,I was on the 30/mo plan forever ! It works great
65623,"###### this $30/Mo plan? Unlimited Talk & Text, 6GB High-speed 4G LTE Data + Mobile HotSpot, Unlimited Video Streaming, Rollover Data

###### it appears that  the ""unlimited video streaming"" doesn't count against the 6gb but their site doesn't say whether it is or isn't HD or throttled."
65624,"https://teltik.com/support.php

Is the T-Mobile unlimited video streaming included?

Yes!

All qualifying plans - with 3GB or more - can also take advantage of the unlimited video streaming and it won’t count towards your 4G LTE data. Data charges do not apply! Please note however, that access to the actual video streaming services are NOT included, rather just that the data which they use will not count towards your high speed data allotment of your plan.

Click HERE (T-Mobile link: https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/binge-on-streaming-video) to review the list of approved streaming services.

Ensure your BingeOn is enabled by checking the status, dial #BNG# (#264#) from your phone. To turn on dial #BON# (#266#), and to turn off dial #BOF# (#263#)"
65625,ah ok so 480p
65626,"Can I shove it in hotspot and use like ATT iPad plan? Or did you use only in ipad/mobile maybe?

Thanks"
65627,No I only used it in a cell phone sorry
65629,"it's t-mobile so it depends on where you are. Rural coverage is usually a joke, but the city coverage is decent and at time beats vzw speeds ."
65630,UsMobile unlimited mobile data with ludicrous speeds on Verizon $55
65631,"If I'm on Verizon, and I switch to this, can I keep my same number?"
65633,"If you have decent Sprint service, Kickstart isn't bad - unlimited data for $25/month and usually another $5 or so for taxes/fees.  Obviously the concerns there are the quality of Sprint coverage in some areas and phone compatibility, along with what will happen to the plan in the distant future if Sprint and T-Mobile do merge.

If you have an iPhone or a few select Android phones, Visible may be the way to go - $40 for unlimited on Verizon with hotspot (but speed-limited to 5Mbps).  They're owned by Verizon and a relatively new service, so it has both the pros and cons of something really new and finding its way.

Next, Cricket is owned by AT&T and uses their network.  They have two unlimited plans: $55 ($50 with autopay) for Unlimited, but speed capped to 3Mbps and $60 ($55 with autopay) for Unlimited Extra, but deprioritized (no speed cap).  Both have pros and cons and searches around here and /r/cricketwireless should help.  For what it's worth, I'm on the cheaper one with a group discount and it's really only noticeable under certain circumstances like app updates over cellular.  In many areas, AT&T's network is pretty consistent, so that's a good tradeoff for speed bragging rights.

AT&T Prepaid has two unlimited plans, too: $65 ($55 with autopay) gets you unlimited, but deprioritized data like Cricket Unlimited Extra), and $85 (75 with autopay) get you data with 22GB until deprioritization, the ability to turn on HD video, and 10GB hotspot.  Almost every other unlimited plan throttled video to ""SD quality.""

Metro has a $50 unlimited plan, too, but they're owned by T-Mobile and use their network, so if you're unhappy with T-Mobile, this may be more of the same.

These are by no means exhaustive, but hopefully a starting point.  How much data do you use?  There's a lot of 8-10GB plans that may also be worthwhile if you don't really need unlimited."
65634,StraightTalk from Walmart. $45 per month no contract 15GB data. It is very difficult to use 15GB in a month.
65635,The $45 plan is actually 25GB per month.
65636,Thanks for the catch!
65637,"They recently changed the plan. I'm on it. When I joined, it was 5GB a month. Then, it went to 10GB a month, to 15GB, and now 25GB."
65638,Yeah I sorta came to that conclusion. I started looking for a deal with 10+ gbs in data
65639,"AT&T prepaid offers their $65 unlimited plan for $45/month a few times a year. 

Pretty sure T-Mobile prepaid offers unlimited for $50/month.

Straight talk is $55/month for unlimited."
65640,"Pageplus(verizon) 55$ for 60gb. Is there better on verizon? Not sure about ebay sellers.

Att is the go/ipad data plan at 35$ monthly. If you use no more then say 5gb then the redpocket annual at 20 dollars monthly is it. 

Im sure someone else here can better address tmobile and sprint."
65641,"If you have Comcast or Spectrum internet, their unlimited plans are $45/month and run on Verizon's network."
65642,"Doesn't help now, but Comcast had a Black Friday promo $500 visa gift card with port in and handset purchase a year or two ago.  Hoping Spectrum does the same or Comcast brings it back in the next year or two..."
65643,Comcast has $250 gift card with port in and new phone purchase now.. Last year black friday was $300 i believe..
65644,"$250 is not bad.  Here is the deal I got in on, guess it was 2017.   
https://slickdeals.net/f/10765331-xfinity-mobile-500-visa-card-per-new-accout-200-visa-card-per-samsung-phone-line-activated#commentsBox
Needed a new phone so the $500 about covered what I wanted.  The extra $200 for a Samsung ($700 go total) was pretty tempting, but I was in too deep with Apple to switch hardware. No problem unlocking once it was all paid off either. 

Fingers are crossed for a similar deal from Spectrum or Comcast soon!"
65645,My wife and I did that but I don't think we'll see that deal again. It was early in their launch.
65646,"True!  I am hoping Spectrum does it to try to catch up though.  Spectrum just launched mobile last year, similar prepaid pricing, and I just moved out of Comcast's area and into Spectrum's."
65647,"I recently changed and looked at Comcast.  From my understanding, you can only use an iphone if you want to BYOD.  It looks like you can still activate on a Samsung device, but only if you buy it from them.  Did I understand that right?

I probably would have given their service a shot, but I've got a Pixel 3 and didn't think they'd let me activate new service with only that device."
65648,"The one month I used them, I had a Pixel 1 at the time. My wife had an iPhone 6S+, so we got the sim for her phone but I popped it into my phone immediately and it worked fine. I might have had to modify the APN, but I don’t recall. If you know anyone with an iPhone, see if they’ll go with you to sign up for service."
65649,"Visible if you want great coverage, Teltik if you want the best speeds. Both $40/unlimited everything."
65650,"Visible unlimited plan for $40

 If sprint is good, $25 unlimited plan from hellomobile ($15gb high speed data and includes wifi calling). Being new, had some hiccups initially but has been good after that."
65651,"I second Visible, except it's heavily deprioritized and capped at 5Mbps. However, it's been great - except the 80-90ms latency. I am on At&t prepaid after being on Sprint's Kickstart unlimited and getting pissed off with the service issues when I have 3 to 4 bars."
65652,$35 ATT ipad plan + google voice(or extra phone tello pay as you go or $5 plan)
65653,"I currently have Wing’s unlimited plan for $55/mo on AT&T’s network and it includes HotSpot. However, when I told the rep I’d think about it, they baited me with a promo down to $50/mo plus tax, so keep that in mind."
65654,"I'm enjoying the iPad plan via ATT, it's really unlimited... I would not recommend red pocket, their data runs out very fast compared to others"
65655,">Teltik 

So is their tablet plan not truly unlimited?"
65657,"Not true... I use 150gb or more per month, no throttle."
65659,So ATT and Teltik both have truly unlimited data? But Teltik is $5 cheaper. Now I am not sure how easy to would be to fool Teltik as it Att on the hotspot side of things. I know a jailbreak would work
65660,I've had near stellar service with Verizon over the past ten years.
65661,"I have T-Mobile. With my plan, I have ""unlimited data"" which is really just 3GB, but you can buy more. I never use 3GB because I'll be on wifi for most of the day.

I'm mostly in South LA. Cell service is fine, I always have LTE (not always full bars). However, in the Malibu area I only have 4G or sometimes 3G--gets a little spotty. 

I think verizon is better with cell service overall, but T-Mobile is cheaper. And the jump program is amazing! I love my freedom to switch phones.

At the end of the day, I can reliably make calls, texts, and use data. It can be spotty (like I said, range in LTE changes) but not disruptive."
65663,"I will be traveling all over for my new job; therefore, I need a cell service that is good throughout LA and hopefully on the cheaper side too."
65664,"I currently have Verizon, and am thinking of leaving. Their data coverage in the Palms/ Culver City area leaves a lot to be desired, and is sometimes non-existent."
65665,"My girlfriend has Sprint and I've had Verizon and AT&T.

Sprint is awful for internet.  Phone coverage is pretty bad also.

Verizon is good for the most part but there are a bunch of weird dead zones, including anywhere on the beach.  4G availability is decent but not great.

AT&T has by far the best coverage, both phone and internet, in my experience.  If you're scared of their customer service, note that Verizon is no better.  Verizon is also more expensive than AT&T by a small amount.

Note that most of my experience is from the south bay so if you're not from here, ymmv."
65666,"I can attest for a fact that Downtown Glendale is a weird ass dead spot for Verizon. Three phones and working there for four years I would get no service in my office, and not any bars until I got down to Brand and Doran. 

Everyone in my office with other carriers actually had service to work with, I was the only one that sat with a dead phone for my 8 hours. Very annoying."
65667,T-mobile was pretty good. I had a few blindspots around Griffith Observatory but otherwise awesome reception in most of Socal and SF
65668,"I work with many mobile phones for many people spread out around LA.

Verizon has the best coverage.  There are a few nooks and cranny's (pacific palisades) where VZW is the only option.

T-mobile's coverage isn't bad, but is much cheaper than VZW.

AT&T - i hate they customer service with a vengeance.

Sprint - People use sprint?"
65669,"I've done and worked for all 4 carriers. 

Here's my honest, no bullshit ranking, based off my experience in the west coast, and Utah/Colorado 

Verizon: Best for coverage. Data speeds abysmal in congested areas(which is everywhere with a population over 5k). Worse if you have a deprioritized plan. Customer service lacks with hold times and stores have this strange civil war between corporate and indirects. 


AT&T: Second best for coverage, second best for speeds. Tmobile is faster. Customer service lacks, not in hold times, but in the amount of overseas reps for literally anything. Pretty balanced company. Shit billing system and they need to lose TV though. 


T-Mobile: Best for customer service, best for speed. Does not work in buildings still as of 11/2018. Coverage 3rd place for that reason alone. Still lacking rural coverage. 


Sprint:


lmao"
65670,"Tmobile didn't get my business simply because there is a startling amount of reports of port out scams. It happens across all carriers but seems to happen (or at least be reported) disproportionately often on Tmobile.

Also, my coworker has Tmobile and most of the time he cant even receive calls inside our office. Unacceptable. In my area, Verizon is king for coverage and building penetration."
65671,"Idk about the port out port in scams so I wouldn't be able to say, but Verizon and ATT definitely work better than Tmo for building penetration. It's like you time travel to 2005 everytime you walk inside and lose signal with them"
65672,"Verizon just added port lock online, so you can now help prevent it from happening"
65673,"i find sprint to be decent in urban areas where the have lots of band 41 (2,500 MHz sites).  Coverage in outer suburbs and rural area sucks - weak signal at best, drop outs at worst times.  My Boost Mobile phone sometimes switches to Verizon's 1 xrtt's network even in urban areas.  I can't comment on mobile data speeds because I haven't used it.  I rather use T-Mobile.  T-Mobile is usable everywhere I've been to even though my phone doesn't have band 71 (600 MHz)."
65674,This has been my experience in Arizona. AT&T is less congested than Verizon.
65675,"They’ve really got an urban/suburban congestion problem but their network across the rest of country still manages to balance it out. AT&T is countering their lack of density with spectrum and it’s surprisingly working well on paper, but everyone seems to gloss over the detriments of poor cell density."
65676,They’ve also got a congestion problem in medium sized small towns (with 5-20k people.)
65677,"Disagree. AT&T congestion is nothing like Verizon congestion. 

Verizon can be congested with just people being out and about for lunch time. 

AT&T will be congested in a stadium."
65678,This has been my experience as well. AT&T doesn't congest often.
65679,Shit my Verizon has been straight Ass in Daytona 😩
65680,"Verizon is straight ass in FL, I had to go back to T-Mobile to get decent service."
65681,Agreed. AT&T is really good in the Orlando area.
65682,"AT&T is generally pretty good from what I've seen, but I only had a SIM for a hotspot for a few months when I needed to make a network for cybersecurity stuff.  T-Mobile is usually pretty good too."
65683,Well now I can at least confirm it’s not only me
65684,"Someone please tell Verizon that congested Band 13 1/2 bars is not reliable coverage on most of the interstates here.  I shouldn't be getting better service on T-Mobile on smaller interstates.  It doesn't make sense.  You're not the only one.  How were the speeds with less spectrum on my shit S7 in buildings faster than new Verizon iPhones and Galaxies everywhere I've tried with more bars (and dbm strength), it's nonsense, especially now that I'm on an S9+"
65685,Oh no. I am going there on vacation next month with my Verizon service.
65686,"I mean, if you're just visiting it should be okay, it's not horrible everywhere, but I wouldn't recommend anyone who lives here switch over.  It is pretty congested for sure, depending on where you are."
65687,We’ll be in the St. Pete area. I am traveling with my mom who fortunately has T-Mobile.
65688,"I lived 40 minutes away from there.  T-Mobile is good there but not as good as Northern Pinellas, Verizon I haven't tried there, but others I am friends with seem to use it just fine.  You should be fine with most carriers around that area."
65689,Thanks! That’s good to know. I figure it can’t be much worse than congestion around the SF Bay Area.
65690,"Definitely not as bad unless you enter Tampa!  Even T-Mobile can choke there sometimes, but not as often as Sprint or Verizon.  I visited SF last year and T-Mobile performed admirably, despite what every single person on this forum told me, saying my phone would be unusable.  There was 1 or 2 spots where I dropped to H+ but otherwise it was pretty good."
65691,We’ll be flying into Tampa but the only thing I can see myself really needing some data for is requesting an Uber. I’ve actually not had a problem the times I’ve used Verizon in SF. I have Starter Unlimited as well.
65692,"If you're deprioritized on Verizon in this area it can be rough, especially where I'm at in North Florida, but luckily you're not going there.  I'm sure you'll be good enough on data as long as you're not going crazy with it"
65693,I’ve used both and found TMo to be kind of shitty in FL (Fort Lauderdale/Orlando/smaller highways) too..  I hear AT&T is good though.
65694,"I can count on two hands spots across the state where Verizon gets better coverage, not even service, but I can list many spots where T-Mobile gets better service.  I've used both extensively.  If you want the most reliable/consistent cell experience in FL AT&T is the way to go, if you want something overall that's still pretty good and can give great speeds, T-Mobile is it.  If you use Sprint...bless your soul, I suffered with them for 3 years"
65695,"Definitely always got better speeds on TMo where I had service but not a single spot I can think of where TMo had a signal and Verizon didn’t after being all over FL with both.  TMo constantly had indoor areas with no signal, especially in south florida.  I never tried B71 though maybe it helped a lot down there.

I have hit congestion problems more and even some down towers with VZ though."
65696,Come to T-Mobile! they’re very good in most of FL
65697,Ordered a sim on the way home
65698,I hope your service is much better than Verizon. Welcome to the magenta fam!
65699,"AT&T has been doing massive improvements on their network with this first net agreement. Speeds have increased, coverage and etc. Verizon is still king. If AT&T stays aggressive like they are now, they could start nipping at the heels of Verizon with plenty of spectrum at their disposal. I opened a byod line with AT&T to test the service and so far its matching the service that I’m currently getting with Verizon minus that I’m able to stream at full HD with AT&T. Between the two, the cost is a $5 difference. My initial impression, I can’t go wrong with either one. The real test would be a road test to see how AT&T would hold up."
65700,I moved to BFE. AT&T was ok if I was at my house but nowhere else if I got past my driveway so I switched to Verizon. I'd go back to AT&T if I ever moved back to town.
65701,They might to more upgrades soon
65702,"that reminds me, I should buy a 4G LTE Tracfone one of these days.  My current CDMA phone is stuck on 1XRTT."
65703,Harvey mudd is a great school if you want to get into engineering. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is also a cheaper alternative.
65704,"Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbra, and USC."
65706,"The majority of people already covered it, but something that might interest you is that Apple supposedly recruits heavily from San Jose. If you're a computer science major, San Jose state wouldn't be a bad option."
65707,"Cal Poly SLO is very good for certain programs and for other programs is, as another commenter said, comparable with other UCs. You should do your own research but Cal Poly SLO is particularly known for Engineering, the sciences, and agriculture."
65708,"So you got SLO which is a csu but uses a quarter system like the UCs. I would say that it ranks as a great csu and can compete with some UCs. 
SDSU (my school) is the flagship CSU so they're always trying to be the top. Hirschman has shifted the culture here in the last decade to a more academically known school and is trying his best to shake off that party school vibe it's known for.
As for the other csus I would say Long Beach, Fullerton, and SFSU are the better ones alongside SDSU. If you got any questions feel free to pm me!"
65709,"San Jose State has got the biggest course catalog in the system.  It's a very large and diverse school, and the engineering and CS departments are fairly well in synch with Silicon Valley.

UCSC is considered junior league compared to some of the bigger campus; and in many ways it is: quirky, underfunded, administratively shakey, no big professional schools, doesn't get the huge grants.  Doesn't even have a full engineering school (if you wanted to do mechanical engineering, you'd have to finish at Berkeley).  It's been mainly a liberal arts university up till 20 years ago, but is trying to move in other directions.

That said, it's got its hot spots and people tell me that econ is one of them.  (I live in Santa Cruz.) They made a breakthrough a couple of years back in getting some interns placed on Wall Street, and they got offers.  Not to say that that'd happen to you, just that the program is good.

The new-ish game design major (now called computational media) is really successful, and the department is well hooked in with the industry.  New robotics major, too.  And genomics is taking off, but that's not your field of interest.

Physically, the campus is amazing.  Few others like it.  Good in some ways -- really beautiful, deer in the roads -- not so good in others as it's very decentralized and there's no real center _and_ it's on the edge of town without a student neighborhood."
65710,"SLO is basically regarded the same as mid tier UCs, at least among the state anyway. I know CSU San Diego aka SDSU is pretty well regarded as well, and it's a little more nationally known (for other reasons but hey name recognition is name recognition).

As far as I know they all have solid programs but they're CSUs, which are geared more towards BS/BA education rather than research/further education, so you might take that into consideration if those implications are important to you. Some of the CSUs are looking to become more like UCs, but it's a slow and small process."
65711,"+1, I think UCSD is arguably the second best school in CS in the list"
65712,"For an interest in computer science and possibly economics in descending order:

Public: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UCSD, Cal Poly SLO

Private: Caltech, Stanford, USC

LACs: Harvey Mudd, Pomona, Claremont McKenna

Of those, USC makes me the most leery and Caltech is by far the ""best"" of the group but is easily the most intense (including ridiculously hard to transfer into).
Really though, California has a lot of great options here."
65713,"UC Irvine, UCLA, UCSD, Berkeley, Cal Poly Slo, Cal Poly Pomona, Stanford, USC, Caltech"
65714,Scripps
65715,"Most of California's public colleges are top-notch.

Stay away from for-profits.

You should be good to go.  Apply for Berkeley, but don't count on it unless you have something to separate you from other applicants.  No, good grades and academics don't do it.  That said, if economics and CS are your interests, try to find a way to combine them.  Make a tool and put it online.  Do something you can demonstrate.  That is a good way to get a leg up with the EECs folks at Cal."
65716,"UC/public schools in descending order (generally): Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Irvine, Davis, Cal Poly SLO.

Private: Stanford, USC, Pepperdine."
65717,Davis is above both UCSB and Irvine on every rankings website.
65718,"Davis is very strong in biology and premed majors, but average in the rest"
65719,"I can assure you Davis is not average in anything. UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCD, and UCB are all top 10 public schools in the united states. An average program to consider would be Pepperdine, and even they are above the national average."
65720,"I didn't mean an average college sorry, I meant that it stands out in the UC system for biology and pre-med, but is comparable to Irvine or SB in other subjects."
65721,also there are a lot of small private schools better than Pepperdine.
65722,"UCD
UCB 
UCSB
UCSD
UCLA
UCI

And as always community college seems to a be good choice, if you are in California and never heard abt these colleges!"
65723,"Let's not forget to shine a light on the CSUs either for their outstanding cost-effectiveness and focus on instruction. As well as the other elite CA unis beyond USC and Stanford like CalTech, the Claremont Colleges, and the great assortment of private Jesuit institutions.

I know you probably just listed out the UCs because it's obvious and easy, and nobody wants to sit here all day listing out the dozens of outstanding colleges in CA, but OP seems to not know shit about it, and we shouldn't just lead him to believe that it's UC or bust."
65724,"Yeah, sorry for being a typical Asian."
65725,"LOL. I'm Asian too. Funnily enough, I rejected all of the UCs for Cal Poly SLO. They can suck it, at least for undergrad."
65726,"California has some of the best, most prestigious, and best of all perhaps the most diverse assortment of colleges in the world. Whether you are a star S-tier student, or a struggling one that is finding their balance in college, there is every type of school for you.

Anybody in this sub would be glad to help, but I question why you ask this.

If you are going to be a college student, there is some responsibility to fall on yourself to make the preliminary research into your school options. I assume that the reason that you have been downvoted is because it is clear to most readers that you have not put any effort into any preliminary research at all.

It takes not even 20 seconds to look up ""best CA colleges"", and stumble upon a list like [this.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ca) It's okay to ask for help when you need it, but this is the most basic of research that takes a solid couple minutes of reading to do. You should do some basic research yourself, and then come back with some more substantial questions.

You should do your due diligence and put the effort into it, because if you can't even do this part for yourself, you will fail at any college that you enter."
65727,"The UC (University of California ex. Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD) schools are definitely excellent colleges in California. There are also CSUs (California State Universities) that are also really good. There are many private colleges, such as USC, Chapman, Pepperdine etc. There's a pretty good list on Niche which you can adjust based on your needs! https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/s/california/"
65728,Google does.
65729,"Other than the UCs, CSUs, and community colleges these are ones I like:

U Redlands 

Whittier

USC

Occidental 

Claremont Colleges 

Santa Clara 

St Mary’s College

U San Francisco 

U San Diego

Loyola Marymount"
65730,"PSA, **public** universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. 

If you need financial aid, look at private universities.  Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply."
65731,"To save everyone a click:

39. UC Davis at 39

37. UC San Diego at 37

36. UC Irvine at 36

34. UC Santa Barbara at 34

22. USC at 22

22. UC Berkeley at 22

20. UCLA at 20

12. CIT at 12

6. Stanford at 6"
65733,"Surprised Irvine and SB are ahead of SD now, that wasn’t the case a decade ago when I went to school."
65734,It shows how meaningless the specific rankings really are.
65735,You don’t think it’s because UCI and UCSB have improved whereas UCSD has relatively stagnated?
65736,"I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but no, I don't think so. Just like I don't think UCLA is now ""better"" than Berkeley. 

Some UCs do have better graduate programs (in specific areas of study) than other UCs. Some programs are better funded at some UCs than others. Those rankings matter. But the general undergraduate rankings are pretty useless."
65737,"I think it's true that departmental rankings matter more, but general rankings are generally true too. As in, on average a higher ranked school has higher ranked undergraduate programs as well as student quality of life.

I think that these things matter in terms of student happiness, mental health, quality of education, and employ-ability. Also more than 1/3 of undergraduates change their majors at least once, and it's good to know that if you go to a university and change majors, you will have a higher chance of finding other good programs too.

Not saying that these rankings are the end-all-be-all, but it's disingenuous to say that they're meaningless, no?"
65738,Was thinking the same.
65739,I’ll admit UCSD has outstanding problems but I don’t understand how US News is putting UCI and UCSB above it. Is there a detailed breakdown? No offense to alumni from either school but UCSD is consistently rated higher than UCI and UCSB in every other university ranked list.
65740,"One of the main factors is total enrollment. If you increase enrollment as a University, you become less competitive ceteris paribus. Santa Barbara has increased enrollment the least, therefore remaining more competitive."
65741,If you want to be employed after college for less than $50k go to Cal Poly SLO. It carries a great reputation in CA
65742,What no slugs!?!
65743,"Dude, Hasan Minhaj will have a field day.

He grew up in Davis and for some reason dislikes the slugs!"
65744,"""for some reason""

doesn't all of Davis? Santa Cruz certainly does. I mean Davis kids are weird, aren't they?"
65745,"My disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.

But on a serious note ucsc is really at crossroads and needs to address some systemic issues at the University. Bad administration of the universities funds and goals along with issues within the town to Santa Cruz are a real threat to the school losing its identity and roots. It's really sad the school provides such an interesting counter to UCAL, Berkeley and Santa Barbara the UC system will be worse off if it's strange little outcast smoking weed in the redwoods loses its identity."
65746,"> My disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.

*Immeasurable

Lemme guess, you went to UCSC? /s"
65747,UCSC is getting up there. It climbs every year but it's not quite elite tier yet.
65748,UCSC represent! We sequenced the human Genome
65749,"Wasn't that this man?

Craig Venter"
65750,It was a world-wide effort. He did come up with the shotgun approach tho that sped things up immensely.
65751,"Hmm, interesting, I think he was leading a competing group, a private one. I'm probably mistaken."
65752,Weird. Pepperdine is #50 and they left it out. Should be 10 schools in top 50
65753,"USC and Cal are both listed as #22, so there's something slightly off about the tally."
65754,There's no #23. If there's an actual scoring system instead of just random rankings its possible they got they same score.
65755,I really hope my family doesn't see this.  We went to basically all of these schools and the rivalry is strong.  Especially with Cal/USC.
65756,Probably because Pepperdine has more students from the UAE than the US.
65757,"? Pepperdine only has 13% international students (87%+ from US) and not sure of any representation from UAE. Majority of international population is from China lol

https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/admission/fast-facts/"
65758,"Ah yes, I can't wait when someone tells me that they went to name-drop school. I'll say, ""wow, thats amazing, the number 23rd best school!"" :D"
65759,"I always hear people talk about how horrible California is but I love this state.  Adding this to the list of reasons why.

I mean, there are many things we could improve but I would not want to live anywhere else!"
65760,"Ssshhhh, let them think that lol"
65761,"I literally never hear how horrible the state is unless the person is too poor to function here. Or has never been here and has some sort of agenda. 

People who can afford to be here who have explored the state? Love it. It's very pretty and there's lots of stuff to do."
65763,"> it's liberalism

are complaints by people who've never ventured outside of the SF bay area or LA counties.  upper northern CA and the inland empire are all conservative areas.

in some respects, CA is a miniaturized, very concentrated version of the US."
65764,Yeah and all those people in Northern California and inland empire complain about liberals nonstop.
65765,"Hey now, the IE largely voted blue this past election.  Only two of the IE's congressional districts are still red, and one of them includes a bunch of eastern land not actually in the IE."
65766,Whoever decided to separate Temecula from Murrieta is a total goob. Ca-50 doesn't make any sense
65767,The problem is those two cities dictate how the rest of the state lives
65769,"I didn't, I perceive San Diego as being more purple than LA or SF"
65770,"California is the paradise it is because of its liberalism, that’s the true irony.  The weather is obviously aside from that, but a majority of the things people love about California are because taxpayers have been paying to keep them that way or make them better."
65771,"It’s just pure ignorance. Like it’s a coincidence that states like Alabama consistently rank at the bottom in economy, healthcare, education, etc."
65772,A lot of people think California is just LA and the bay area. Neglecting the ridiculous amount of other interesting places this state has.
65773,I live in the Bay Area and the amount of my neighbors who have literally never been outside is insane. They are transplants from other countries and won't go to the local park 'because there are dogs and they are dangerous'.
65774,That's really unfortunate... I'll regularly do 2 hour drive day trips from LA on weekends just to get out to some wilderness haha
65775,"I hear it from some people at work. They complain about taxes, cost of living or whatever is the latest bill or law that went into effect.  They sound like Republicans or Libertarians more than anything."
65776,It’s basically a meme at this point with people of a certain political alignment. They parrot whatever talking point that the man on the tv or radio says.
65777,"i think its funny how many people from other states go out of their way to trash California, meanwhile those people or their states aren't ever on our radar."
65778,"most of the hate for cali is based on politics, if i hear somebody dogging on California they're probably a hyper partisan dingleberry"
65779,"> there are many things we could improve but I would not want to live anywhere else!

Its funny, EVERY state has things they could improve yet CA always gets singled out. Jealousy."
65780,"Go Banana Slugs!

We don't need no stinking list."
65781,Idk man ucsc had been pretty highly ranked for many years because of the research being conducted by the faculty/students. I think that research provide some of the context that makes ucsc such a cool place I think not being on this list is a bad sign for the school.
65782,"agreed.

while lists are lists, we can't have the anteaters ahead of us. I mean, have you even visited? It's almost worse than the bobcats."
65783,"I’m happy to see UC Davis on the list, but also surprised at Cal Poly’s exclusion."
65784,"They classify Cal States as ""regional"" universities as opposed to ""national.""

It's the #4 university in the category ""Regional West"" 

https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university-san-luis-obispo-1143"
65785,"No real surprise, the CSU system has always been looked down upon because they're not ""prestigious"" , likely because they're not research schools. Cal poly is leagues ahead of all the other CSUs (and many of the UCs IMO) at teaching actually usable skills and getting people into well paying jobs, but it still isn't well known outside of California. 

Source: Cal poly grad who moved out of state. The only people here who realize how good of a school Cal poly is are other CP grads"
65787,"Agreed! But I was mostly referring to out of state people not knowing Cal poly. They know the big names like UCLA or UC Berkeley, but Cal poly is largely unknown"
65788,I’ve had employers explain to me that they want someone who is willing to pick up the book and learn what you need to learn to do it rather than the person who is writing the book. Employers love Cal Poly.
65789,Did you go to Pomona or SLO? Considering transferring to CPP this spring if they accept me. That or CSULB.
65790,SLO. Not really sure how Pomona stacks up to the other CSUs
65791,Not as good as SLO but better than the other LA area counterparts. Plus they are extremely well funded by the Kellogg Foundation.
65793,And anyone who does major construction projects.
65794,"Not it...categories are based on PhD's (among other things).  The CSU system isn't a PhD-giving system, so the schools are not in this category.  Cal Poly is a great school, but isn't going to be compared in this category unless, well, the education model changes completely."
65795,Not true. There are CSU's that grant PhD's. CSU's are teaching institutions...UC's are research institutions.
65796,"CSU's generally work with a specific UC for PhDs.  CSUs have decent research programs sometimes, but they are unable to grant PhDs on their own.  Not every department even offers Masters degrees at CSUs."
65797,I was a little unclear...you can grant some PhD’s but none of the CSU’s are designated as PhD granting institutions.  Someone posts the actual verbiage below.
65798,"From the [methodology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings) page:

Takeaways:  

* CA has 6 out of the Top 11 in the public school rankings.
* SDSU and Fresno State managed to get ranked in the National Universities rankings despite being CSU campuses.  The other 21 Cal State campuses, including Cal Poly SLO, are in the Regional Universities (West) rankings with the exception of Cal Maritime, which is listed in the Regional Colleges (West) category.
* With UC Merced rising to a tie for 44th place among public schools, the 9 UC campuses with undergraduate populations now all boast a ranking better than or equal to the best public schools in 25 US states."

65809,"It appears that the main difference between “national” and “regional” schools is how many doctoral programs are offered. Fresno offers 8, making it just one of 2 CSU campuses with more than 5. (The other one is SDSU, which offers 23.) Meanwhile, SJSU offers 2 doctoral programs. And Cal Poly is one of seven CSU schools that apparently doesn’t offer any doctoral programs at all. 

Anyway, I think that’s why SDSU and Fresno are the only Cal States in the “national” rankings, though it easily could have been just SDSU as they’re the real outlier when it comes to doctoral degrees."

65814,"im only targeting UCI for my daughter. even w/o scholarship/aid, i think we can afford her tuition as long she stays at home"
65815,"If it's a long drive, that may be pretty hard on her. 

My first year in college I lived at home with a 40+ minute drive even when there were no big problems on the freeway. :)"
65816,"just 15 miles from our house 😝

it would be a nice policy that as long as u qualify, nearby residents should have priority on the UC campus nearest to them"
65817,Yeah right. Like the UCs are gonna turn away that out of state $
65818,"its just a wish

my point is:

its more cost effective for residents to just choose the nearest campus (assuming u qualify)"
65819,Can you guys help me finding resources on getting into a college/university in california from europe?
65820,"If you go onto any school’s websites admissions page, you’ll get all the information you need"
65821,"My kids won't be able afford any California University, but its nice to know they exist."
65822,"California public universities are some of the most affordable in the nation. When factoring in quality of education, they're unmatched.

Edit: California has the [lowest in state tuition](https://www.collegetuitioncompare.com/state/) of any state."
65823,"They may be affordable to you, but they're too rich for this household. I'm glad they're here though."
65824,"FAFSA and Cal Grant are there for low income house holds. California has the cheapest in-state tuition of any state in the US. There's always private loans as well. 

My parents didn't make a lot and I got some decent help from the government, but I graduated Cal Poly SLO with only 10K in student loans, which honestly I probably could have cut out if I lived a lot more frugally."
65825,"Yeah, my kids are part of the flourishing middle class. Not poor enough to get help, but rich enough to give help to others. Plan is for community college at this point. I've got a few years more to save, but 30-40k a year for a UC is out of the question."
65826,Which you can do... and then transfer to a 4 year like myself and thousands of others.
65827,">30-40k a year for a UC is out of the question.

You realize there's also CSUs, a few of which are better than most UCs. Half the cost too."
65828,"Yeah the CSU's are [more affordable](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/paying-for-college/Documents/19-20-coa.pdf) than the UC's that's for sure. Still, not everyone can afford an extra $1,500 a month for a kid, let alone $4,500 a month for 3. We need these institutions, but the honest truth is not everyone is going to be able to afford to attend."
65829,"My parents covered my housing costs for college and I covered tuition via loans and scholarships. You might be able to do some similar cost splitting to make college more affordable for you. Taking a year or two at community colleges isn't a bad idea at all, especially if your kids aren't 100% certain what they want to do.

My living costs in college were about $1000/month and my tuition at Cal Poly was about $6k per year. It's still a pretty chunk of change, but if your kids go to a CSU and have a part time job, it might be affordable enough."
