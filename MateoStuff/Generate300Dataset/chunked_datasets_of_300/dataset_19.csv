6204,Yes! My husband and I argued about the sequencing the entire time. I was going crazy and he liked it. It was so interesting but infuriating to follow. I came away feeling like I knew less about basketball because it confused the timeline so much!
6205,"Completely agree with that, what’s wrong with chronology?"
6206,"I guess to follow themes rather than strict chronology? I though the whole series was exceptional, editing and all"
6207,"I thought it worked best when the episode was about a specific cast member/""antagonist"" around Jordan"
6208,"I’m not sure I understand what people are saying about the editing. It’s not *that* hard to follow, and as someone who knows nothing about basketball - or sports, really - I found the whole series super engrossing. 

But that’s just me!"
6209,If you just keep in mind that the whole series is about the final season and each episode is about the stories and people leading up to the literal Last Dance - I think it’s easy to follow. And they even show the year before each time jump.
6210,It's a great series but it jumps back and forth through time which is a bit jarring.
6211,"Pretty sure it just bounces between the last season and then the seasons leading up to that season pretty much I chronological order. I actually found it kind of nice because you’d be able to see the players younger and older, obviously MJ in particular. 

Fantastic documentary."
6212,"Blackfish - truly incredible documentary about killer whales (orcas) being held in captivity by sea world, and the many dangers that come with it"
6213,I've never watched anything as stunning as Our Planet... A bliss for everyone's eyes
6214,"""Ottoman: Rise of Empires"" is a great look at the Fall of Constantinople over a few episodes."
6215,*Murder Mountain.*
56247,Seconded.
6217,Fyre
6218,"I loved business of drugs, one of the best documentary shows I've ever seen"
6219,"The Last Dance 

Even if you aren’t a sports fan it is a fantastic piece on the career and legacy of MJ. I’d recommend this to anyone"
6220,Making a murderer and the staircase are good true crime type docs
6221,High Score.
6222,Is this good! I saw on the new releases today and added to my list but wasn’t sure.
6223,VERY well done!
6224,Currently watching this! Perfect for video game lovers!
6225,Dont fuck with cats
6226,"https://streambuddy.io/lists/d8ca1d17-great-netflix-documentaries

All of these are very binge worthy IMO"
6227,"Stink! - all about chemicals in our daily lives and how unregulated a lot of industries/products are that we use. 

Shot In The Dark- About people who make and sell footage to news outlets in LA.  Like what the movie Nightcrawler is about but they follow around the real people who do it for a living.  

Alone- Making people survive in the wood by themselves.  Last person standing gets a half million dollars. This is more of a reality show but its still good.

Mars- More of a docudrama but it is very well done.  Following what colonization of Mars would be like.  It is shot in a way that draws on real world issues and makes parallels to what might happen when we colonize Mars.   

Waco- Another Docudrama but still very good about well Waco.  If you don't know much about the incidence and it's lead up I highly recommend it.  

Frye- Documentary on the failed Frye festival.  It's actually fascinating. 

Rotten- A documentary series about the food industry and its failings and shady practices.  

Tread- A man feels slighted by his adopted town.  Builds a tank and takes revenge.  

Making a murder- Man is accused of murder twice.  But is he innocent? 

Behind the Curve- About the flat earth community.  

And once you finish all that and your bored why not go down the UFO rabbit hole?

Unacknowledged - Aliens are real and the governments been covering it up.

Bob Lazar Area 51 and Fly Saucers - Aliens are real and this guy worked on flying Saucers."
6228,I’m halfway through The Making of a Murderer. Seriously WTF was going on there?
6229,"Shot in the Dark is so good and IMO, underwatched. When the twin has to go save someone from a burning car...shit, I did not expect that to affect him so much after and almost take him out of the game. Scott is a douche but he’s effective at really getting the good shots"
6230,Yeah that’s what got me hooked
6231,Alone is great. Never thought I'd get invested like this in a reality TV show. Sadly there is only one series on Netflix.
6232,There are a couple more on Amazon prime
6233,"That season is all I’ve seen, but wow. Fabulous show. The winner is one of the most amazing real human beings I’ve ever seen televised."
6234,"I know it’s not a Netflix production, but did Mars get renewed? The second season was half the eps of the first and I haven’t seen any signs of it continuing.

Edit: I thought s2 was shorter, guess I was wrong. Both about the same. But nothing new since 2018.

Edit 2: from Wikipedia: “The lead actress Jihae confirmed that the series was cancelled after only two season's on her official Instagram”. I’m sad now. It was a good series."
6235,"I wouldn't call Waco a docudrama, its a drama loosely based on the actual Waco event"
6236,I’ll give you that.  But never the less still very good and well done.
6237,Oh yeah I enjoyed it
6238,Immigration nation
6239,The Devil Next Door!!! It’s about a man who was deported from the us and put on trial in Israel for being a nazi soldier in a concentration camp.
6282,13th
6241,"Long Shot - DescriptionAn innocent man is accused of murder, leading his attorney on a wild chase to confirm his alibi using raw footage from a television show.

The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez - (this is one is hard to watch) A boy's murder and the trials of his guardians and social workers prompt questions about the system's protection of vulnerable children.

The Mind of Aaron Hernandez - Through interviews with friends, players and insiders, this docuseries examines how Aaron Hernandez went from an NFL star to a convicted killer."
6243,"Very good, but the episode on fasting could be triggering for people with eating disorders."
6244,How to sell drugs online fast. Based on a true story about a teenager who gets into selling xtc in a crazy big way.
6245,"Evil genius.
The only thing I'm gonna say is, I couldn't even imagine something like this happening."
6246,Fyre festival
6247,I really liked History 101 and Untold History of the United States
6248,Upvote for Untold History of the United States.
6249,"If you're interested in food at all, Chef's Table and Street Food are incredible.

Chef's table looks at some of the best chefs in the world and tells their stories, often delving into the driving forces behind their love for food. For some, it's an attempt to preserve the  traditional dishes of their culture. Others, they're trying to gain recognition their cultures dishes in high cuisine (they have one episode about a chef who's Michelin star restaurant is devoted to the taco, iirc). They're really lovely stories of humanity and love for food, and an incredible watch (for food porn alone, if nothing else).

Street Food: Asia and Street Food: Latin America are for the same director, and take a look at the street food and ""common"" dishes from various cultures. It's a great celebration of the common man, their food, and the struggles of these small-time vendors."
6250,LA 92 and Icarus are incredible !!! highly recommend
6251,Hypernormalisation. If it's not on Netflix anymore then you can watch the full thing on YouTube. Amazing.

6261,One excellent doc from a few years ago is “Something’s Wrong with Aunt Diane.”’Gripping.

Those are just the ones I know are currently on Netflix. There’s a lot more, I’m making a list that’s my current COVID goal. These were some of my favorites hope you can find something good! I left off the other ones I saw mentioned."
6270,Have a good trip: adventures in psychedelics
6271,"I'm upset that Ken Burns isn't on Netflix anymore. Jazz, prohibition, and the circus are *chefs kiss*
The Searchers is fantastic for true crime. 
I highly recommend Betting on Zero for how predatory MLMs are.
Jesus Camp if it's still on there. Indoctrination is scary, guys
Hot Girls wanted for a very eye opening look at the porn industry. 
And Catwalk is so fun and silly and fascinating. Also I can look at the face of the champion cat without laughing. It's like a 90 min long meme. Delightful."
6272,"For true crime there are a ton, but for the two that got me sucked in and blew my mind were

Making A Murderer

By the end of it you'll feel like you journeyed with them and you'll be devestated its over. 

Its awesome."
6279,"If your into sports, The Last Dance"
6280,"The Act or Killing. It’s about a genocide in Indonesia, so it’s not light subject matter, but it’s incredible. They take the people responsible for these killings, who were never punished for it, and let the, recreate what they did. Some of them are clearly having the time of their lives, reliving their glory days, while others start to realize what they did. Watching the walls built in a murderer’s mind start to crumble is a truly incredible thing to behold."
6281,"I don’t know if this counts as a documentary, but the show Formula 1: Drive to Survive was a great show. Highly recommend"

6295,When hero's fly ......crap name but excellent Israeli thriller
6296,"Highly recommend Last Chance U if you’re into football. They hone in on the junior college scene where young college players scrap to make their way onto the Division 1 scene. Follows few players through the whole season, both in their games and their academic/social life. Great visual style too."
6297,Explained by Vox
6298,The Spy
6299,"""Story of God"" and ""The Story of Us"", both with Morgan Freeman. Having Freeman is reason enough to watch, but he goes and explores other cultures and learns how they view and navigate their world. They're some of my favorite documentaries ever"

6318,Dear Zachary.... will break your soul. Wonderfully told
6319,It's a great documentary but I can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. It's just so heartbreaking.
6320,The best documentary I’ll ever watch once...
6321,"I’m crazy about documentaries, I’ve watched pretty much all of them, and I have to say NONE has stuck with me as much as Dear Zachary. The storytelling is the most fucking raw shit I’ve ever experienced, talk about being taken on a ride. And I also have only been able to bring myself to watch it once. *that* moment that happens, dang.... I have never felt second hand anger so strongly"
6322,I loved Nightstalker. I was on the edge of my seat.

6332,The Pharmacist
6333,"Social Dilemma.

The Last Dance was powerful for me as a basketball and sports fan."
6334,I thought The Game Changers on Netflix was quite interesting. Definitely makes you think about veganism in a new light
6335,The Devil and Daniel Johnston about a troubled little known musician who had big influences on indie/rock musicians since the 80s.
6336,"""Unseamly"" its on discovery plus, theres a 1 week free trial but if you like crime docuseries its def worth it! 

""Unseamly"" is about canadian Peter Nyguard who is almost as bad, if not worse, than Jeffrey Epstein. if you are sensitive to sex trafficking then i wouldnt recommend because descriptions can be graphic but its a CRAZY story"
6337,"ALSO, on HBO, ""The Vow"" is amazing, its about the NXIVM cult.

then also on Netflix ""Wild Wild Country"" is great (another cult docuseries) and of course if you havent watched the Ted Bundy tapes that is a must-watch"

- Evil Genius: History’s most diabolical bank heist
- American murder- Family next door (on Chris and Shannan Watts, and their children. Just...yikes. Pretty horrific)
- Going Clear- A study of the church of Scientology (THIS is HBO, but I rly wanted to include it bc it dives so deeply into the toxic world of Scientology, and the effect it has in its members. Truly powerful)

Still finishing The Cecil Hotel rn, I’ll let u know lol. Everything else- SO good! EDIT- I forgot to include “Fyre” however there’s like 5 of these man so idk which one I actually watched but- dude has issues and he’s still robbing ppl to this day. Pretty fked, sparked a lively debate in my household anyway."

Maybe because some of the songs/products are so odd, or because the ""main character"" was a comedy writer for David Letterman, I spent the first half convinced it was all a windup.  A very interesting topic/piece of Americana I knew nothing about before watching and left really appreciating everyone involved.  It's on Netflix too I believe."

It's a short documentary, cheaply made for a local West Virginia PBS station, but it soon went viral through VHS copies and word-of-mouth due to its fascinating subject: Jesco White, a white trash, sociopathic, glue-sniffing, Elvis-impersonating tap dancer in rural Appalachia.

It's on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAS4PtGxiA4


The *Jackass* producers financed a full-length follow-up 20 years later, *The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia*, also excellent, which follows Jesco and his extended family for a year. ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQBiXDNVeSA))"

6437,The West by Ken Burns.
6438,"The happy people: a year in the Taiga.  Absolutely terribly named doc about Russian fur traders in remote Siberia.  A strong feeling of self sufficiency and isolation here (think a little bit the mood of Deadliest Catch or other Man v Nature) but with an interesting subtheme about whether to stick to a more traditional mindset or not.  Hard not to think how cushy modern life is after, but also appreciate some of the peace and the pace of this totally different, almost pre modern life."
6439,"Absolutely amazing film. Wholeheartedly agree with the misplaced name. I thought it was about an isolated tribe around the China area. I couldn't have been more off. I came out of this completely envious of the people shown. Actual, honest to god men!  I took a good look at myself in the mirror after I watched this flick!"
6440,Anything with Werner Herzog associated with it is going to be fantastic. And this was no exception.

6443,Thank you for your great comment!
6444,10 mph.  About two guys traveling across the country on a Segway.
6445,Sounds great :) adding it to my list now.
6446,Senna. Its about Formula One racer Aryton Senna. I have never watched Formula One and really enjoyed it
6447,I have seen it while browsing but never payed much attention. I will go check it out!
6448,"Me too. I have seen this film about 1,000 times while browsing Nwetflix. I think maybe because the cover art is so eye catching. I've heard good things about it, and like the previous poster said, I have no interest in Formula One (or any racing) however, I have been pleasantly surprised more than once by a doc that I thought I would have no interest in.

I do believe I will watch it soon..."
6449,I did the same thing. Thought I would only watch it for 15 minutes and then it sucked me in.
6450,"The natural drama of his life was genuine, inspiring, and eye opening to how big the culture of F1 is.  Easily my favorite documentary on Netflix, maybe even my favorite of all time"
6451,"The two escobars. Don't let the fact that it's an espn film discourage you if you don't like sports, it's more about the situation of Colombia than anything."
6452,I think the 30 for 30 series is great regardless of whether you're a big sports fan or not generally. I think people shouldn't hesitate checking out the rest.
6453,My two favorite 30 for 30 documenatries focused around Len Bias (Without Bias) and Chris Herren (Unguarded).  Both are insanely gripping.
6454,I'm a sports fan. I will check it out.
6455,Even better.
6456,Its really interesting but I found it very difficult to focus on the was it was made!
6457,You meant Colombia right?
6458,"Yes sir. Bit of an error on my part, i'll fix it."
6459,"* **Hoop Dreams:**
Two of Chicago's top high school basketball prospects face pressure on and off the court in this iconic documentary about sports, family and race.

* **Marwencol:**
After a terrible beating left Mark Hogancamp brain damaged, he began creating models of a fictional town, Marwencol, to process the trauma. Jeff Malmberg's documentary explains how Hogancamp uses the elaborate dioramas as stand-ins for real life.

* **Indie Game: The Movie:**
This captivating documentary follows several indie game designers as they painstakingly develop their games and hope for breakthrough success.

* **The Queen of Versailles:**
Meet the Siegels, glitterati who made a fortune in the time-share business only to see it crumble in the 2008 financial collapse. The site of their rise and almost-fall is their home (America's largest), a gaudy replica of the Palace of Versailles.

* **Into the Abyss:**
Director Werner Herzog's compelling documentary examines the emotional aftermath of a triple murder in Texas, interviewing the two convicted killers, their relatives, the victims' families and law-enforcement officials involved in the case.

* **The Thin Blue Line:**
Filmmaker Errol Morris's gripping investigation into the murder of a Dallas police officer was responsible for freeing the man who was originally -- and erroneously -- charged with and convicted of the crime.

* **Pressure Cooker:**
Three Philadelphia high school students negotiate the challenges of the inner city and the demands of their tough-minded culinary arts teacher, Wilma Stephenson, to become contenders in a citywide cooking competition. Charming and surprisingly hilarious, Jennifer Grausman and Mark Becker's inspiring, Emmy-nominated documentary showcases the heights young minds can reach, regardless of their environment, when they're expected to succeed.

* **Page One: Inside the New York Times:**
Documentarian Andrew Rossi goes inside the New York Times to examine how the venerable paper is preparing for the future of newsprint.

* **Hot Coffee:** This documentary examines the so-called ""hot coffee lawsuit"" in which a woman sued McDonald's after she spilled her coffee and burned herself, specifically looking at the reasons why the fast-food giant invested heaps of money to sway public opinion.

Plus, U.S. Netflix seems to have all of ESPN's 30 for 30 documentaries, most of which are well worth watching if you like sports documentaries. 

Documentaries seems to be one of the genres that Netflix has the best selection of. We have an annual documentary film festival here in Toronto, and a lot of the most buzzed about movies of recent years (Marwencol, The Imposter, The Invisible War, Queen of Versailles etc.) are available for streaming, at least in the U.S. Even in Canada, the selection is not so bad. I guess the rights to documentaries are easier for Netflix to license than big budget action movies or whatever."
6460,"Crossing The Line  
The Imposter  
Brother's Keeper  
The Great Happiness Space  
Dark Days  
Wild & Wonderful Whites of West Virginia  
The Dust Bowl  
Into The Abyss  
Exit Through The Gift Shop  
Children Underground  

I'm a documentary addict and these are some I rated 4 or 5 stars. They all stuck with me quite awhile after watching them."
6461,I also second The Great Happiness Space.
6462,Spoiler alert:  I like how all of the female clients of the male hookers were also hookers.  It was fun to wrap my mind around that.
6463,I second Wild and Wonderful Whites. The family portrayed in it is unlike anything you've ever seen.
6464,"The Imposter was INSANE.  Exit Through The Gift Shop was a total mind fuck, it almost felt like you were being pranked.  Into The Abyss was surreal, Werner Herzhog (director) is a master of re-creating harrowing tales.  If you dug Into the Abyss check out Grizzly Man, it was actually really good."

6467,"**David Attenborough Nature Documentary Series** - 1 Hour each, between 8-10 episodes per series

There's a few of these on Netflix right now, and they're all amazing. David Attenborough has a way of telling a tale of the natural world that I haven't found with any other documentarian. He breaks things down in such a way that you learn so much but are left being able to draw your own conclusions and walk away wondering about deeply interesting issues and questions. I've never seen someone who is so capable of explaining nature so succinctly and deeply as him.

**[The Life of Mammals](http://movies1.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Life_of_Mammals/70213010?trkid=7808591)** 
>Breaks down the Kingdom of Mammals into logical categories and tells the history of evolution and fascinating specialization of beautiful and interesting creatures who scratch an existence out of the smallest niches. **[9 Episodes]**

**[The Life of Birds](http://movies1.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Life_of_Birds/70213012?trkid=7808591)** 
>An examination of how Birds got to where they are evolutionarily and the unique and surprising challenges that life as a Bird poses. From how flight came about, to what they eat and why, to communcation, the demands of an egg, and more. A fascinating insight into what being a bird *is*. **[10 Episodes]**

**[Wildlife Specials](http://movies1.netflix.com/WiMovie/David_Attenborough_Wildlife_Specials/70213167?trkid=7808591)**
>A great series of in-depth looks at the life and challenges of individual animals. Each episode follows one animal species through its life and takes a detailed look at every aspect of their lives. From Polar Bears & Wolves to Crocodiles & Humpback Whales and more. **[8 Episodes]**

**[The Blue Planet](http://movies1.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Blue_Planet_A_Natural_History_of_the_Oceans/70235731?trkid=7808591)**
>An exploration of the many surprisingly unique environments under the ocean's surface. David Attenborough dives into the amazing differences possible below what looks the same at the surface no matter where you go. **[8 Episodes]**

There seems to be a disease in most modern nature documentaries lately that just ends up with them all being so dumbed-down and childish. The David Attenborough documentaries never have this problem. They neither assume that you're a biologist nor do they see you as an utter simpleton and talk down to you. I've never watched any nature documentaries as good as those produced, written, and narrated, as those from Mr. Attenborough. Watch them!

Let me know what you think, here :)!

Note: I posted this to [it's own thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/1mhqre/david_attenborough_nature_documentary_series_810/), as well, as I think these are deserving of a little more individual attention and discussion."
6468,"Watch Cocaine Cowboys.  It's an INCREDIBLE documentary that chronicles the cocaine boom of the 80s and just how influential it was to the city of Miami.  It's narrated by smugglers, dealers, enforcers, hit-men,  etc.  I'm a sucker for all kinds of documentaries and this one is definitely in my top 5.  Cocaine Cowboys 2 is also good, but the story is mostly narrated by a single person, whereas the first Cocaine Cowboys is narrated by many different people who were in the business."
6469,"I have heard praise for this film endlessly. I don't doubt that it is a good film, but I feel like I have seen enough drug documentaries in my life - quite a few about the 80's cocaine subject. On the other hand, I am pretty curious as to why this film seems to stand head and shoulders above the rest. I'm sure it will hold my attention, and that I will probably end  up enjoying it, I just can't seem to ever press play on it."
6470,Restrepo.
6471,"zeitgeist: moving forward - A feature length documentary work which presents a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical ""life ground"" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a ""Resource-Based Economy""

surviving progress - Humanity's ascent is often measured by the speed of progress. But what if progress is actually spiraling us downwards, towards collapse? Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, A Short History Of Progress inspired SURVIVING PROGRESS, shows how past civilizations were destroyed by ""progress traps"" - alluring technologies and belief systems that serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. As pressure on the world's resources accelerates and financial elites bankrupt nations, can our globally-entwined civilization escape a final, catastrophic progress trap? With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behaviour, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn't an evolutionary dead-end.

samsara - Filmed over nearly five years in twenty-five countries on five continents, and shot on seventy-millimetre film, Samsara transports us to the varied worlds of sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial complexes, and natural wonders.

the house i live in - From the dealer to the narcotics officer, the inmate to the federal judge, a penetrating look inside America's criminal justice system, revealing the profound human rights implications of U.S. drug policy.

the imposter - A documentary centered on a young Frenchman who claims to a grieving Texas family that he is their 16-year-old son who has been missing for 3 years."

6500,Icarus is absolutely fantastic.
6501,Came here to say this. It's not often you get a documentary that starts as one thing and ends on the frontline of a global controversy
6502,"This was definitely one of my favourites, I for sure did not see it going where it ended up lol."

I did not expect to like it as well as I did, but it is captivating."
6506,I really didn’t even expect to watch this one. I was about 10 minutes in oddly enough I was hooked. Jiro’s story is definitely an incredible one lol.
6507,Don’t Fuck With Cats. It’s really dark and messed up.
6508,I read the description for it and decided there's no way I could handle watching it
6509,"It’s heartbreaking, don’t watch it if you don’t think it’s something you can handle. I had to stop it several times and that was years after knowing the full story and it was still hard to watch."
6510,It's worth watching. You do NOT see the animals being killed.
