9704,"Third year here. My first year I was placed in San Nicolas Hall, on the 7th floor, ocean side. As far as views go, it was really hard to beat. I had a straight view to the pier and faced east so I got super amazing sunrises if I happened to wake up early enough.

San Nicolas has co-ed floors (as opposed to San Miguel), so that was really nice. All of the residence halls except for San Rafael have washer/dryer rooms inside the building itself.

I'd say the most important thing is don't feel like you have to stick around with your floor just because they're there. I found a better floor that my friend was living on and I had a much better time there."
9705,Where do San Rafians do laundry?
9706,put on all our clothes and jump in the pool
9707,There's a separate building not too far away. It's essentially next door; it only sucks if its raining cuz then your clothes get wet.
9708,Sounds awesome! I'd be so stoked to have an ocean view. Thanks for the info!
9709,"Ft is so far. Far from school, far from the beach. Don't under any circumstances apply for the scholar's floor. I got placed there randomly...boring. But other floors were really fun. I'm pretty sure Manzanita is the best though. That's where I hung out most besides ft, and it was so nice and had the best view. Plus it was right next to the beach, and I know a lot of people who liked Carillo Dining Commons best out of all the places to eat. Make that your first choice I think."
9710,"The thing about Manzanita is that you don't get the same social life as the other freshmen. Manz is about 60% transfer and foreign students. It is also extremely quiet and from what I've heard, not that fun. It may work for you, though. The views are also excellent from what I've heard. Also, Carrillo has gone to shit this year."
31852,Thanks for the heads up!
9712,Thanks! Manzanita sounds awesome for location and rooms! Ahhh too many choices!
9713,"I was in Anacapa my first year. I loved it, it was literally steps away from the beach, as in you stepped out the door, crossed a small road and were right at the beach steps. It was on campus/near the other channel island dorms, which was what I wanted, so I was close to friends and most classes.

I guess my complaints are that the dryers didn't dry so well, and I was in a triple, so space was limited. Also Anacapa is the furthest from IV, so the weekends were a bit of a trek. Not that I minded that much, traipsing through campus at night with your friends is kind of fun. 

From the sound of it, I'd think you'd enjoy either Anacapa, Santa Cruz, or Manzanita. I found those to be more quiet and they're all very close to the beach."
9714,"I also was in anacapa my freshman year and this person is right, you are pretty much on the beach here, it is amazing.  I was in a triple as well and was a CS major so I was close to all my classes.  Santa Cruz was pretty much the same as far as I could tell.  Also as far as getting to IV have a few drinks in your room before heading out and the 15 or 20 minute walk to IV is nothing, also campus is pretty cool at night.  If you long board Anacapa is a couple minutes from some great spots, I don't know if they have cracked down since I left or not but we used to go to the engineering parking lot late at night and skate there for hours.  Man all these posts recently have made me miss UCSB a whole lot"
9715,"I really like the traditional style of Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, I think Santa Cruz is my first choice. Thanks for the tips!"
9716,"Out of bias and nostalgia, I'd liked to say that San Miguel is great. It's steps from a decent dining common, close to most classes and you have the San Miguel Ghost. I really loved being on the Creative and Performing Arts floor, as we were one of the tightest knit groups that I know of. Both of our floors bonded well and often.

But I heard that Santa Cruz is actually really great since it has pretty big rooms, near the beach and a dining common, but triples everywhere. I never heard of any tripling in San Miguel. Anacapa is also good, but a little further away from classes, but only relatively.

Fuck FT!"
9717,"But, if you plan on using the elevator in San Mig, you're going to have a bad time."
9718,"Thanks! I think my main decision now is whether to go high rise (San Miguel and San Nicholas) or low rise (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa). So stoked!"
9719,"Not sure if you are still looking at this but i was in san miguel last year and it was horrible. Old and rundown, and it is not coed floors a result, while i do have a lot of friends, they are all guys and its harder to hang out with chicks. We had like 6 move off the floor because it was so hard to socialize with other people. Id say do one of the low rise options, you'd have a much better time."
9720,"Hey, I'm a first year Econ and Accounting major in Santa Cruz Hall. It's great! 45 second walk from the beach. I could give you the typical advice like ""Balance academics and partying"" but honestly it will all come naturally to you. Making friends in the dorms isn't difficult and everybody is just really friendly. If you want to chill, you'll find somebody to chill with. You want to study, you will find somebody to study with. Anything you want to do, you will find somebody to do it with. College has been great so far and I never want it to end. One of my roommates is trying to get into the Mechanical Engineering program...have fun! Who knows, maybe I'll bump into you around campus next year...haha obviously I won't know it's you, but still that would be pretty rad. 

Edit: My advice is not to live at San Cat. I'd shoot for Santa Cruz, Ancapa, Santa Rosa, or San Nic. It's all personal preference though."
9721,"Thank you! Santa Cruz looks awesome to me, probably number one! Too many great choices, seems like I really can't go wrong!"
9722,"Good to hear! I hope you get Santa Cruz and have an equally, perhaps greater experience here! It's a wonderful place."
9723,"FT sucks, between the distance, location, and shit food it is by far the worst dorm, well San Mig is pretty bad also. I would recommend going for one of the shorties(Santa Cruz, Anacapa , Santa Rosa) the rooms are the biggest most people are in doubles, and they are close to the water and the dinning commons. My first year was in Santa Cruz and the dorms themselves were great. Plus as an engineer must of your classes will be near the shorties, and will getting to and from a lot easier."
9724,Nothing. Best god damned time of my entire fucking life. If I could go back I would do so in an instant. Enjoy every second of it. It will probably be one of the last times in your life when you won't have to worry about eating or cleaning.
9725,"santa cruz is DEFINITELY a good choice. finishing up my first year here and ive met some awesome people. youll probably get stuck in a triple but honestly its not that bad, especially if you take down the lofted bed and put it up against the window. i know a few people who did this and it creates a lot of room. think about it. as far as social life goes, im in the substance free floor (dont take the name seriously) and the social scene is just as good as ft. all the freshmen from anacapa, santa rosa, santa cruz being close together creates a very cool, very chill scene that rages quite often. the ra's are a little more strict but you just have to be careful. anyway have a great time man! thats all the advice i could think of. (also, if you smoke there are some great spots nearby :)"
9726,portola.
9727,On campus.
9728,"Chi-5 are the best. Personally I would choose San Nic, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, Anacapa, Santa Cruz (in order). But they are all pretty similar and any would be good. Manzanita is more sophomores. FT is a mile off campus but 1/3 of the freshmen class lives there."
9729,"Also, it depends on the experience you want. All the dorms on campus are dorm style (sharing a bathroom for the whole floor) while FT has two rooms share one bathroom. Honestly, after seeing both, I preferred the dorm because 5 people sharing one bathroom can be too much."
9730,"One more thing! They have ""special"" floors so you should look to see if any of those interest you. They aren't especially different than any other floor but the RA may try to put on a few more events towards that ""theme.""
You can see all your options on this link and what dorm they are in:
[http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residence-halls/living-learning-communities]"
9731,The only perk of the bathrooms is hot boxing.
9732,Santa clara is the best for freshmen right?
9733,There are no Santa Clara dorms.  Are you thinking of Santa Cruz?
9734,I think so. I just want a location with lots of freshmen.
9735,"[Look at this](http://www.aw.id.ucsb.edu/maps/images/UCSB_largemap.jpg)  Directly to the left of the legend is where the majority of the dorms are.  San Miguel and San Nic are towers.  Santa Cruz and Anacapa are identical two story buildings, and Santa Rosa is a unique two story building.  That whole area is swarming with freshman all the time."
9736,"[Really shitty map](http://imgur.com/QcXLM3S)

Red = shorties (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz)

Blue = towers (San nic and San mig)

Purple = manzanita and san raf (they house transfers too, unlike the chi-5 which are only freshmen)

and yeah FT is over...there

Edit: Green are the dining halls, figured I'd include them too."
9737,"I'd recommend one of the chi-5 (the 5 dorms in the middle of campus).  Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa (the ""shorties"", 2 floors and kind of shaped like swastikas), or San Nic and San Miguel (the ""towers"", 8 floors).

FT (Santa Catalina) is about a mile from campus and surrounded by construction.  Manzanita and San Raf are on the edge of campus and quiet and not very social."
9738,"Would definitely recommend the chi-5, like some said before. I am currently in San Nic and its amazing. But would not want to live here another year."
9739,"I was in Anacapa for freshman and San Raf for sophomore. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Anacapa if there is any choice in the matter. Great location, great view. I'll never forget it!"
9741,"Any dorm on campus. I personally like Anacapa or Santa Cruz, then Santa Rosa and San Nic equally, then San Miguel"
9742,"Here's a map that shows the UCSB residences: http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/residences

If you're a freshmen, check out this page: http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/community/freshman (look at the right to see the res halls you're eligible to live in).

If you have any questions about UCSB Housing, please feel free to ask me. (I work for UCSB Housing.) Thanks!"
9744,Oh damn thought it was segregated
9745,FRANCISCO TORRES!!!!!!   FUCK FT!!!!!
9746,But it's gone..
9747,"It will always be FT.  Living on campus has it advantages, but there is a lot more concentration of people living in those two towers than all the other dorms on campus.  You are close to IV and the Goleta Town Center.  If there bike ride scares you, you can take the bus."
9748,Dude trop is like the worst place to live.
9749,FT aka Santa Catalina is the most lit fo sho no questions asked hands down.
9750,Yeah just put it in my first choice.
9752,Do tell.
9753,"I've heard very mixed reviews. Some cool people live there, but it's expensive, the foods not as great as on campus, and there are a lot of write-ups. Are you a transfer or a first year?"
9754,First year.
9755,"Does anyone know which one is a good residential hall for a transfer student and how much would it cost me for a double or triple?
Thanks fellow gauchos...!!!!"
9756,"Hi, I work for UCSB Housing. Transfer students aren't eligible to live in the UCSB Residence Halls this year. Check out this page http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/community/transfer-student. If you look at the right you can see the UCSB apartments you're eligible to live in. Hope this info helps!"
9757,Thanks for the link. Do you know how much would it cost me of out the door for these apartments?
9758,"Here's our [rates](http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/rates) page. The rates include utilities, internet, etc."
9759,fuck ft
9760,fuck FT
9761,"I would say it really truly depends on the person. For example, as a freshman I really wanted to live in Manzanita Village, or San Miguel because they were considered some of the quieter dorms. However, if you wanted to socialize more, you would probably feel happier in FT or any of the Channel Island dorms. It really depends on who you are as a person."
9762,FT has the best bathroom situation. Portola food is still lousy but imo having only five guys to a bathroom is preferable to sharing one with the whole floor like Santa Rosa. Nasty af
9763,Portola actually has the best food now after the redesign
9764,"I would probably have to disagree, as an FT resident... DLG at least is still way better imo. The salad bar situation at Portola has a lot of gross limp vegetables, and their vegetarian options aren’t as good at the other dining commons. 
        
That being said it’s not bad st all. But I always enjoy going to Carillo more than I do going to Portola. They also have a weird thing going on with the serving size there."
9765,Carillo is definitely the best. DLG is buttcheeks tho.
9766,portolas amazing!!! way better than dlg!!!
9767,"Santa Cruz and Anacapa have the best locations. They are actually on campus instead of a mile away like other dorms \(Santa Catalina/FT, Sierra Madre, etc.\) Both residence halls are across the street from the beach and a 5\-10 minute walk to classes. After that, I would say San Miguel, San Nic, Manzanita Village, and San Rafael because they are also on campus. Don't be tricked into choosing a farther dorm, it is a pain to have to bus or bike over a mile to class each day"
9768,"As someone who lived in San Nic, Santa Cruz is definitely the best dorm. It got cleaned up and refurnished a few years ago, it is the closest to campus point and has a beautiful lawn."
9769,"FT is almost a mile from campus, so if you enjoy biking. It's only a 10 minute or less bike ride though.

I have no experience in ft but they just rebuilt the dining room there so maybe it's better?"
9770,"I was in Santa Cruz last year and Manzi this year.

Santa Cruz had way cooler and more interesting people in it, but the nice thing about Manzi is that the bathrooms are individual (there’s like 3-5 per floor) instead of locker room style. The rooms in Santa Cruz were nicer too, but Manzi is closer to Carillo which is the best dining commons in my opinion. These are the really big differences I noticed, besides this AMA"
9771,"FT is further from campus but if you get a bike then that's completely fine. You share a bathroom with one other dorm which is a huge+, especially if you get chill people who you share the bathroom with too. In biased because I lived in FT my freshman year, but FT is the best dorm.

Also, FT = Santa Catalina"
9772,"I would recommend staying in the Chi5 over FT.  It is off campus, so if you have an hour between classes, you have to find somewhere to hang out, while if you lived on campus, you could go take a nap or something  and not have to plan to spend your entire day on campus. There is only one dining hall for FT, while for CHI-5 there are two close by and also Carrillo which is a bike ride away. FT might look like a hotel high rise since they have pool etc, but CHI-5 is like a resort. It's just more livable. It's next to the beach or lagoon, people sit out on the grass, it's serene. FT is on a busy street with people constantly yelling ""fuck FT"" from their cars at you. The CHI-5 dorms are tamer than FT, but it doesn't really matter if you are in a party dorm because you just go out to IV to party anyways. 
Out of the CHI-5 I would say Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Rosa over San Nic and Mig because there are a lot of stairs and their rooms are pretty small, even if they are doubles. I'd say Santa Cruz > Anacapa>Santa Rosa. Santa Cruz is the closest to the beach and the most newly renovated. Anacapa is just as nice, it's just slightly farther away from everything. (These distances are pretty negligible but if you want to get picky). Santa Rosa is more in the center of things, right next to two of the dining halls but it looks like it is stuck in the 70s and it's not looking over the beach at all."
73422,"The Anker Power bank, I think it's the 20000 mAh, charges a phone and a tablet multiple times no problem, takes a while to charge though"
73423,Is it heavy?
73424,"[It's](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-20100/A1271012) probably about the weight of a tablet, just sort of lives in my backpack when I'm traveling anywhere. I don't really charge it consistently but when it's empty I just leave it plugged in overnight and it'll be good."
73425,I've got it and mine is 208g.
73426,impossible
73427,Damn you were right. I have the 10000mAh model.
73428,It is fairly light. Amazing customer service and longevity!
73429,Seconding this.
73430,"I have an Anker 10,000 mAh (not sure which model). It's pretty old now, at LEAST 6 years, but it's quite light and a bit smaller than a deck of cards, I'm sure they're even better now. It'll charge a newer phone about 3x. Those cheap little chargers are usually about 1,000mAh and phones are around 3,000mAh so they're really not very good. You can get a 10k for like $25 and a 20k (six charges) for not much more, so it's worth the upgrade to one of those.

I'm a big fan of the Anker brand and so I'd definitely buy from them again."
73431,"Yeah, from reading here, Anker seems to be the way to go. I like the 10K and the 20K, but the 20K might be more than what I'm looking for."
73432,I have an Anker 10K with PD. So it has USB A out (IQ I think) and USB C for charging input and PD output. It charges my Pixel 3XL as fast as a wall charger. I love it.
73433,"Anker is good stuff, and for me, 10k seems to be the right weight/capacity tradeoff, as it's similar in size to my phone.

One thing to watch for is making sure that the inputs and outputs match your needs to avoid carrying extra cables and to take advantage of any quick-charge capabilities your wall charger or phone may have. 

Also, in the age of USB-C, I encourage you to test everything at home. I've got at least one device that works fine using an A-C cable, but won't power up on a C-C cable."
73434,nitecore nb10000. it's the lightest you'll find at that charge capacity. easily charges a cell phone 2-3 times
73435,This one is popular among the /r/Ultralight (minimal wilderness backpacking) crowd.
73436,"Size wise it seems like its among the best for sure, but the lack of power delivery sort of kills it for me."
73437,"Using the Zendure 10,000 mAh. Love how small it is, and has usb-c."
73438,"Replying to support Zendure as well. I even bought their larger tank version (26800), and it can power my USB-C ThinkPad for 1.5 charges."
73439,"Another vote for the Anker 10,000"
73440,"At 3oz the Attom Tech 5000mAh is perfect for me.  Got it on amazon

Finding a onebank can be tricky.  For me it was more about weight than anything else.  I do the same with phones and my crappy Galaxy J3 is lighter than everything out there.  

When travelling though, I try to unplug and take in my surroundings/read/etc."
73441,"I've got an 8,000mAh one from SMARTCOBY, pretty small/lightweight. Kind of hard to find good options between 5k and 10k, which is the sweet spot for me.

I think most probably do these days, but be sure to look for one with pass-through charging (so you can charge the power bank while it charges your phone)."
73442,didn't think of using it that way... that is not a bad idea at all!
73443,"I have a couple i choose from depending in the trip:
-	Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000 is a combo plug/battery
-	Anker Power Lite 10000 for times when there’s a good chance I’ll be away from a socket all day"
73444,"I like the 10000, but I like the smaller one also because I can combine it with the plug and get rid of one more thing..."
73445,"I have a bunch I've collected over the years from anker, ravpower and jackery. The one I travel with currently is the Ravpower 15000mah. At the time, it was a good combination of size, power and output (18w)

73449,"For USB charging devices like phones, I just carry one of those cheap little oblong power banks containing an 18650 battery. I cut a notch in its door edge and removed the vendor's stupid glue, so when the battery is flat, you just pop the door with a screwdriver (I bike so I usually have one) or key and swap the battery for a charged one and carry on. Maximum charge for minimum bulk - just make sure you carry the batteries in holders so they can't short."
73450,If you’re outside a lot you might consider getting a solar charger - it’s saved me on hiking/camping trips in the past.
73451,"I use [this Aukey powerbank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK63TSJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I wanted something 10k ma, which is the sweetspot of size and juice imo. Can charge my phone ~2 times which is usually long enough to get to an outlet overnight. Also USB-C was important to minimize the cables I carry. This fits both of those."
73452,"I like this one! wish it had wireless charging, but still, I like it!"
73453,Anker 10000 PD because I need power delivery to charge my camera. They make a 20000 version too but I think it's too big.
73454,"I also like this one, so far its the winner in this post."
73455,"I use an Anker PowerCore 10000mAh Power Bank. 181g/6.5oz. I have one of their 10k slim models with two USB-A ports as well. Both have quick charging “IQ” ports and they work very well on my iPhone, Fire and iPad Mini tablets as well as legacy USB devices. 


I find that I don’t need more capacity (read weight/expense) than that for travel. It can charge my phone several times and I consider it backup vs a everyday method of charging. I use a multi port USB charger so I can recharge everything at once when I get back to my lodgings. 


The only reason I would go bigger would be if getting into areas with no reliable electrical service. The cell service probably wouldn’t be good as well, so it’s a toss up."
73456,"Samsung Wireless Battery Bank, 10000mAh. Takes USB-C in, and has also a Qi charger on top of the battery pack. I use this also as my “nightstand charger” with the phone sitting on top of it, and another device charging via a cable"

Neither have let me down; they've always gotten me through tight spots, but also to be honest I've very lightly used the second one / it's become more of a backup that stays in the hotel room. The first has gotten heavy heavy use in all settings in a bunch of countries. With COVID I also stopped traveling and forgot about them, found them in my bag recently and tested their battery levels, still held a charge."
73458,"I use an Anker Powercore Slim usb-c PD. 10,000. They have one now that also has a stand on it which is nice. Fits nicely in all my tech pouches or slots in backpacks. 20,000 are heavy (I have one of those too for trips where I could be away from an outlet a while).

They also have a 20000 that has wireless charging, PD, and a stand for your phone. Pretty cool. 

10k is my sweet spot and good for most people I think."
73459,"I find that the best way to calculate is usually by the total battery then round up to the nearest 5K or so. If you have about 3700mah battery and have 2 off them, I'd try to find 10K battery or so. Those batteries are about the same weight, and there are some that has solar charging. It'll be painfully slow, but if you'd be outdoor, it'll help if you hook it to your backpack.  


EDIT 10KmAh should weigh about half a can of soda."
73460,"I have a Romoss Sense 8+ 30,000 mAh 

It’s pretty heavy, and I haven’t had a chance to use it (I got it during a Black Friday sale and am not traveling cuz of covid). I do have high hopes, whenever I travel to cold places my phone used to die after 2 hours."

73527,I second Anker. Top notch products. I've owned probably 20 different Anker products and none have really ever failed me. Their powercore line of powerbanks are the highest quality powerbanks available.
73528,"Third. Also, cell phone charging cables are vastly superior."
73529,Fourth
73530,"Fifth, for sure.  Wonderful cables, spectacular power banks, lovely waterproof speaker; I highly recommend Anker."
73531,Indeed. I started using their Powerline+ cables almost exclusively about 8 months ago and haven't looked back. They're so good.
73532,"Anker makes great stuff and they stand by it. I had a multi-USB charger that one of the ports died on, and they sent me a new one, no questions asked."
73533,Anker or Aukey are clear shots for the best.
73535,Kind of unethical...or actual theft.
73536,"Considering the fire hazards of poorly designed lithium batteries, I would not get a battery pack not made by an established company: Anker, Mophie. Asus, Xiaomi, Energizer and so on.

Also, do not buy from Amazon as they have a big counterfeiting problem and doing almost nothing to combat it."
73537,"Do you mean FROM Amazon, or ON Amazon.com?

Amazon the seller is the most reputable seller

The website + all other sellers are not"
73538,Both. They have a program called commingled stickerless inventory where they mix their own inventory with that of third-party merchants in the same bins. Thus even when you order from Amazon themselves you can still end up with a counterfeit.
73539,"The commingled inventory you speak of, from what I've researched on, only applies to third-party sellers who opt into ""Fulfillment by Amazon"". Amazon wouldn't dare taint their own inventory, they have a separate facility for those sellers. Can you imagine the lawsuits

By the way, you can click view other sellers and specifically choose Amazon to buy from directly"
73540,"Well, yes. If they’re not “fulfilled by Amazon” their inventory would not be in Amazon’s warehouses in the first place.

It’s unclear whether Amazon is able to retroactively trace the source of the inventory in the absence of stickers, but that program was clearly not thought through, just another example of Amazon turning a blind eye on counterfeiting. Whether this is deliberate or not is open to question.

Your faith in Amazon is misplaced, there are certainly reports of counterfeiting on Amazon orders:

https://consumerist.com/2014/05/12/does-amazons-inventory-commingling-help-fake-products-fly-under-the-radar/"
73541,"> By the way, you can click view other sellers and specifically choose Amazon to buy from directly

I’ve gotten items that I thought were “directly” from them and ended up being FBA. I though I was buying Amazon stock but I got third party stock. I know this because they directly told me so. Don’t know what variables lead to this (maybe out of stock items?) but Amazon has no problem letting you believe stock originated from them. Twice I’ve called them out on this (car parts,work boots) and they apologized and offered return refund, or partial refunds to keep items."
73542,"With how technology is always advancing, there isn't really any rule (that I know of) for this type of thing.  


A product suggestion though, I purchased a belkin 10,000 mah charger that is about the same size as my phone. It seems well built, and reviews for it were all very good, and it is a trusted brand. It was definitely significantly less than $50 CAD (on sale, near 50 full price), but I do not remember the exact price. 

They might also have a bank that charges using a lightning cord, or type C,  instead of standard microUSB.

73548,"Anker uses quality cells and I've been happy with mine...however all batteries degrade over time so really there's no BIFL solution yet, but Anker is a good bet for a solid product."
73549,"Can recommend Mophie - have bought myself a 30,000mAh for £37, which I love. It's heavy but I don't mind. I also bought a Mophie 10,000mAh as a gift for a family member. Both have had heavy use, with almost no wear and tear, and both still perform well."
73550,I bought one at an auto parts store that's powerful enough to jump start my car multiple times.  Cost around $90 but seems way more legit than the cheap call phone batteries you see all over.
73551,Go to the meeting rooms area at a Vegas hotel and wander into one during one of the breaks and grab a USB battery/charger off one of the sponsor tables.
9855,Anker is the best. I have the 10k version and it's small but lasts.
9856,"I have the Anker 20000mAh battery. Definitely recommend the brand. I don't use my phone much at festivals, but the 20k mAh battery made it all the way through 4 days of TML without needing a charge."
9857,ditto on this. i have the exact one and it'll charge my 	Galaxy S9+ slightly over 2x from 0-100%. takes about 6+ hours to recharge though.

It’s a little on the bigger side but it kept both of mine and my boyfriend’s phones charged all weekend! They have a smaller version, too"
9859,"I done ton of research on this, tried a few chargers and the answer is one - Anker! (the exact model is the number 2 on this list [https://digitalaquarius.com/best-portable-charger/](https://digitalaquarius.com/best-portable-charger/) ) - get it and it will be the last one you will ever need. it's ultra portable compare to the other good ones in the category and it last for ton of time. simply the best out there without a question."
9860,"Hands down the best camping, long-term portable charger I've owned.  I purchased this charger for LIB 3 years ago & have taken it on every road trip and camping music festival since!  Fully charge it before your trip. It keeps our phones at full charge for the whole event! (4-6 days).  I'm sure this is contingent on how many people you share it with and how often you need a full charge (we did about 2 a day with 3 people).

9866,"Just to check, we are definitely allowed to take portable chargers in?"
9868,"Anything Anker. Go to /r/Anker

I have quite a few power banks and USB-C cables from them.

Best stuff on Earth. Suck on that, Snapple lady!"
9869,"I like the Samsung 5100. Not a very large battery but good quality, comes with a nice USB C cord, has fast charger, charges via USB C, I just bought a second one the other day off Amazon it was on sale for $20. Anker, zero lemon are two other companies I've had good experiences with."
9870,"I use something like this ( https://www.ravpower.com/6700mah-external-battery-charger-silver.html  although I have it in black) I got it back when I used my nexus 5, but it still did well to charge my phone and was fast."
9871,"Im new to portable chargers but I just bought AUKEY 10000mAh Power Bank, 18W USB-C Portable Charger with Power Delivery. It's the smallest I could find that has power deliver for fast charging. So far it works great."
9872,For portable chargers (and earbuds) I always go for xiaomi. They have decent prices on gearbest and similar sites (not sure which of these is best for the US though). They tend to be excellent value for money with excellent build quality.
9873,"I bought one last week. Their 10000mAh usb-c version. Disappointingly, if I use a cable with usb-c on both ends, it's ph-1 charging the battery, not the logical direction. 

I need to use the supplied usb-A to micro-usc cable with the also supplied micro-usb-c adapter to charge the phone properly. While ph-1 reports ""charging"" or ""charging slowly"" on the lock screen, the overall charging speed is not too bad (about 2.5 hours for 10-90%). 

Wondering if direct usb-c charging were working, will be faster?

Who has a <10000mAh usb-c pd battery that works well?"
9874,"Ah, these batteries are normally usb a to usb c for charging a device and vice versa. I don't know if there are USB C to USB C for charging. I don't think this is causing the charging speed issue. I have had the charging slowly issue with rapid charging wall chargers lately (i'm having it now actually). I have to reset the phone for it to charge at fast speed, and even then it doesn't always work. This should be the same with the charger. I haven't checked if I have the problem with my portable xiaomi battery. This seems to be an issue thats happening since the upgrade to Pie. Try resetting it then plugging it in again and see if it states that its charging rapidly."
73350,Anker
73351,"I have yet to be let down by my 3yr old Anker. 

I'll buy another when this one poops out."
73352,I took my anchor on a 3-day backpacking canoe trip and it's save me the entire time with two bars left of charge (50%)
73353,Anchors are too heavy for my trips but I can see the appeal of getting a workout in
73354,"Works for security, too. Tie your bag around it, let's see if any would-be thief will manage to run off with it."
73355,I had a kayak but if not I would use a solar panel.
73356,Every Anker product I’ve had has made me happy. Good stuff.
73357,"Agreed Anker. I use it everyday to charge the iPad I work off of for 12 hours, it is amazing years later. Bought for $50 on amazon"
73358,+1: Check out the PowerCore Slim series
73360,"Seconded, they are just really great powerbanks. Had mine for close to 3 years and it still holds an excellent charge and works perfect even after being treated rather rough"
73361,Plus one. Cannot recommend my Anker pack highly enough
73362,"Seconding this, had two anker powebanks through the years, both were amazing!"
73363,I didn’t know what brand mine was that works very well so I looked at it and it’s anker hah
73364,"Which anker would change two iPhones and iPad and Nintendo switch at the same time?

Or atleast a combination of any two of the above mentioned devices."
73365,"If you want 20,000 mAh you need to expect to carry something about 0.4kg. The lightest is probably the Anker PowerCore 20100 at 355g; the rest are 380-450g.

At this capacity all the power banks are ‘baggable’ rather than pocketable and the come in about twice the thickness of your phone; they also take overnight to charge from empty and you must use a high power charger; if you save weight by packing a puny 1A charger it’s going to take a full day.

However 20,000 mAh is comfortably enough to run my phone for five or six days. If you’re going to be away from power for more than a week like this, you have other things to consider so I think 20000mAh is the maximum sensible capacity for everything except crazy expeditions.

I can thoroughly recommend the Anker ones, they are lightest at this capacity and very well built. There are several models with different combinations of ports and power delivery options. They don’t support passthrough charging (Anker say it’s risky), but otherwise have every feature set.

Personally I wouldn’t cheap out on this kind of device and invest in a reputable brand. There is enough energy being transferred around when charging and discharging these big batteries that you don’t want an overheating and fire risk in your bag.

If you want something more pocketable, step down to 10,000 mAh chargers; at this point you’re talking about something phone sized."
73366,This should be the top comment. I regret my 20k
73367,"Nah I always have a 20,000 mAh one and a 3,350 mAh one. The larger one is great for long travel and if you are on the top bunk of your hostel and there are no outlets. I use it as an outlet for the 2-3 days I'm there an dont worry about charging my phone from the wall during the day. The smaller one I carry with me when I go out at night or if I am not going to have a bag with me. I think a large one and a small one are a perfect duo!

Edit: I can see just getting a 10,000 mAh one though. I just really like having a larger one and a smaller one."
73368,"Yeah I get all that, it’s especially useful on a 26 hour flight with no outlets but the weight becomes a bother. It’s just big and heavy enough to cause discomfort in my sling bag. I think a 10k is a good median. Also if you upgrade I recommend staying with USB C"
73369,Agreed. I've been upgrading everything to USB C for about 2 years now. 😉
73370,"Well, I guess we are on the same wavelength. I already have the Anker PowerCore 20100. I was hoping for something as powerful, but even lighter and easier to pack. It seems I have my answer."
73371,"The Anker 10000 PD is lovely. Actually... I have the older 10000, too. Both are smaller than a deck of cards and will fast charge most phones I have tried."
73372,"If it turns out that 2 10000 mah power banks (or multiples of lower mah) weigh less than 1 at 20000, it might be worth a shot to go this route."
73373,"I do this and rotate them.  


I was given 2 free mophie 6,040 mAh charges from Verizon and I just keep one charged and one in my bag.  Then I can swap out.  Each is good for 2 full charges.  So I can get 4 full charges without worry and they take far less time to charge.  

If I were to purchase my own? I’d go with Anker 8,000-1,100 range as I have there very old 20,800 mAh power bank and it is still going well after 4+ years of use.  But that one I relegate to long trips where I won’t have access to ANY electricity for 5+ days."
73374,"The ravpower Batteries have passthrough charging if that’s something you care about.  I personally do.  Allows me to plug in my power bank and use it as a splitter to charge everything I own at the same time as charging the battery itself.  

The anker powerbanks explicitly do not do this.  You’re either charging the bank or the devices connected to it but not both simultaneously.  Supposedly this helps with the long term health of the power bank but I don’t really care about having it in pristine condition 5 years from now.  

I’m also going to suggest the OmniCharge 20c+ since that’s the one I actually use.  The downside is that it’s hella expensive (~$199.  Got mine on sale for $165.) compared to everything else BUT it has two power delivery enabled USBC ports and also supports passthrough charging.  I can charge my MacBook (and two more devices) at the same time as the power bank is charging and that’s awesome."
73375,"This is an important point, I carry a 10000mAh Aukey over an Anker for this reason.  As a business traveler I have to charge headphones, phone, laptop, and sometimes a tablet.  With this device I can plug it in and then pass through charge the headphones, tablet, and phone saving a plug."
73376,"This is what I roll with. Serves 2 purposes in one and saves space/weight in my one bag.

73377,"One thing to look out for with these are outlets with old and loose...holes. But seriously, it seems more often than not US airport outlets are too weak to hold anything heavier than a two-port non-battery charger.

I have a similar sized non-battery 4-port Anker charger that often falls out. At least this one will keep charging your devices from its battery, though."
73378,"Same issue for me. I bought one and then the next trip I took, it keep falling out of the wall outlet at the hotel. Last time I used it and now my son has it. I prefer the dedicated charger with 2ports, use the battery during the day or travel, plug the battery and phone in overnight."
73379,"Bend one prongs of the plug outward, so holds itself in place."
73380,Best reason for pouches. I usually prop them up with a pouch.
73381,Is that like a purse? I’m not sure what you mean by pouches.
73382,"Think of packing cubes, but for electronics. https://www.sfbags.com/collections/pouches or https://www.peakdesign.com/products/field-pouch"
73383,"Ditto to this. I’m not going to be away from a wall outlet for longer than 24h, and with this device, I don’t have to fuss with specifically charging a powerbank."
73384,I just bought my 10K PowerCore Lite and found out about this... now eagerly waiting for resupply at my local Anker outlet. This is actually optimal for on-the-go day charges and saves some space in the bag. If this is sufficient to power my Pokemon GO obsession while traveling then I’ll reconsider my CARD Traveler + Anker 10K setup.
73385,anker or aukey are the go to brands.
73386,"I currently use a Xiaomi powerbank, was previously using an Anker one. The Anker one is older and larger, but while in use, never gave me any issues. I'd recommend either one."
73387,"Anker!

We own two of each for our camper. We live on these things for a long trips. They're also under regulation size for all flights. Both not too bad for (mens) jeans or a jacket pocket for their capacity, kinda bulky but you aren't going to get slimmer for that size. Definitely comfortable to throw in your backpack for a hike. Durable so far (2 years of many many camping trips and flights home)"
73389,Mophie just tends to cost way more for little-to-no added value.
73391,Nothing wrong with mophie but there is a premium to the name that isn’t warranted.  If buying new the better value is with anker 9/10 times.
73392,"May not be quite what you are looking for, but here is an alternative to the popular Anker.

2. There is no flight time on the planet that my iPad’s battery can’t outlast when watching a realistic amount of movies.

2. Half a KG is excessive for a ""what-if"" item.


Perhaps a tiny powerbank for a 1-iPhone charge wouldn’t be bad of an investment to have for those rare occasions when you get to a new country and realize you don’t have enough battery to find your Airbnb because you’ve been using your phone to listen to podcasts all day.

No real world scenario has ever left me thinking ""damn, should have brought a 20.000+ mah power bank...""

73510,"With 20ah, not too high in capacity but high in power, compact and passthrough (i believe): the new baseus blade powerbank. 100w in and output on usb-c and has 4 ports in total."
73511,"20Ah, FTFY"
73512,thanks :)
73513,"I've been using large Anker and Ravpower banks for years. They've been okay. I got the zendure powertank maybe 6 months ago, and it's been fantastic.  I wanted pass through charging and 65W or better USB type C output, and it supports both of those. The biggest issue is that it's pricy, and their new powertank model is even more expensive."
73514,"Hello,

I have power banks from Anker, RavPower and Zendure and they all seem to work well. 

I will point out, though, that RavPower is one of several brands that Amazon removed all listings for:  https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon.  Other removed brands include Aukey, [Choetech](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow), and Vava.

Searching the USB Implementers Forum (USB trade group) website at https://www.usb.org/products for ""power banks"" brings up only a handful of USB-IF certified power banks, so any of those models might be ones to look at as well.

Regards, 

Aryeh Goretsky"
73515,"> I will point out, though, that RavPower is one of several brands that Amazon removed all listings for

They're still on Amazon. All they did is rename themselves to iSmart, remove all mentions of RavPower from their product nomenclature.

Aukey might be *Oriental Hero* on the big rainforest (unlike the real place, which is fast becoming a savannah…)"
73516,"I personally use an Anker powerbank, and it’s been great so far, but one issue of note is that you have to charge it with 5v 2.1 amps or else it charges super slow (like 1-2 days to fully charge)"
73517,"This sounds, like you have an old one without USB-C Power Delivery. This issue shouldn't exist with the new models."
73518,"I do, it’s held up pretty well and I plan to run it until it dies, but I guess it’s not much of an issue with the newer ones"
73519,It's good to use old stuff until it dies. I just wanted to make clear that this issue doesn't apply to current USB-C models.
73520,Mophie makes a couple good ones but they're not cheap. I got one of their Powerstation 3XLs on sale a few years ago. Up to 45W charging and fabric wrapped. I don't see it on their website now though so I'm not sure it has been discontinued.
73521,"Do you want to carry it on a plane? If so, you aren't allowed a capacity above 100 Wh (~26,000 mAh)."
73522,"I personally have the [Anker Powecore III elite](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/anker-powercore-iii-elite-26000-mah-87w-usb-c-pd-portable-charger-black/6433261.p?skuId=6433261) as my high capacity battery. It outputs 87w but charges at 100w, allowing me to fully charge it in about an hour with the right charger."
73524,Seems good but I'm in Aussie land.
73525,I have a Comsol branded one from Officeworks. USB C in/out so charges fast both ways.
9966,"£20 and BIFL rarely go in the same sentence, especially with electronics at play. 

I have a Lenmar PPW20000k that's awesome. Paid about $100 for it. 

4-5 full charges from dead on iPhone 6
4 USB ports: 2 for phones at 5v 1A, 2 for tablets 5v 2.4 A
Pass through charging (important!)
'Charge bars' to indicate power remaining
Small enough to fit in a coat pocket, bigger than a jeans pocket. 

Good luck!"
9967,"We have been using an Anker for the past 3-4 years and it is going strong. We have a bigger one, I think it is like 10,000 mAh, and so it isn't small. We get about 3+ charges for a phone out of it (used to be 4-5 when it was new)."
9968,+1 for Anker. I have the 13k mAh and it gets quite a few dead to full charges.
9969,I have an anker one as well. I get  3-4 charges out of it.  The battery stays charged up so I can pull it out of a drawer after a month of not touching it and it's still fully charged. I'm very pleased with it.
9970,"Li-Ion batteries have a lifespan of roughly 3-5 years, depending on usage. You won't find anything that lasts significantly longer than that, so try to find something with a decent price/performance ratio without spending a fortune.

There is no BIFL portable charger."
9971,"Please read the sidebar and understand that BIFL is about the spirit of the law, not the letter"
9972,"Despite that, it is important to point out that no lithium ion battery product will last beyond that lifespan, regardless of brand or price. This is important information for a buyer to have, especially if they were under the mistaken notion that purchasing a more expensive one will give them a longer lifespan."
9973,It's 20 quid.  Phones don't even last that long.  It is a moot point to bring up the fact that it will not be true bifl
9974,"My phone's 4 years old and still going strong (after a battery replacement, of course). I plan to keep using it until it breaks and I can't fix it."
9975,"I use the limefuel 15600mAh. I bought mine for $40. 
It charges my iPhone 5 at least 5-6 times from dead. It's a little big so maybe you can get a smaller battery size for a little cheaper.

9977,That range is pretty extreme.
9978,"I also own a Limefuel battery pack and charger. It's a wonderful device; it will charge Apple and Android devices at 2.4 amps. It supports pass-through charging which is handy if you have one foreign power adapter and want to charge your pack and all devices overnight. It charges from a standard micro-USB cable.

The limefuel charger is also quite good; it can charge 2 devices simultaneously at 2.4 amps each and works wonderfully with both android and apple devices."
9979,That thing probably sends some pretty bad power out of its USB ports and subsequently puts great strain on the battery of whatever is charging off it.
9980,Why do you say that?
9981,"It's really cheap, has an enormous battery, and lots of ports I doubt there is much in the way of power regulation between the battery and the output."
9982,"I have an Anker Astro Pro 20,000mAh and it's saved my ads from being stranded with a dead phone more than quite a few times!!"
9983,"I can recommend the Xiaomi 10400. Really cheap, too. Been using it for a few months now and it's great. But as others said, don't hold your breath for BIFL qualities."
9984,"this... 

i got it new for 15 euros from a reputable Chinese site and charges my Nexus 4 4 times"

9986,Look at Jackery. I can get two full charges for my iPhone 5. Pretty convenient.
9987,"I have a zerolemon 10,000 mAh battery. Only had it for a few months, but it seems durable to me.

9988,A MintyBoost with a second pair of batteries should charge an iPhone 5s.
9989,"I've been using [this little bad boy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D41CYWO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for a few years now.  I got one for my wife too.  It helped us survive a trip to Europe, and now it mainly sits in the boot of my scooter to charge my phone as I drive.  not sure about BIFL, but it's taken a serious beating and keeps on humming."
9990,"Look at the Amazon Basic products. I have one that uses a micro USB cable that's built in but there are some that can be used with iPhone. Mine $17 USD, definitely a good buy in my book."

No, even the best batteries degrade over time if you actually use them"
9992,http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower®-10400mAh-Compatibility-Thunderbolt-Incredible/dp/B009V5X1CE this is the one I have and its small and even comes with a carrying pouch. It's also only $22!
9994,Nobody cares.
9995,Bye
9996,I wouldn't call any portable battery charger buy it for life: due to the nature of lithium ion batteries. They lose capacity over time.
9997,thank you. several people have already pointed that out
73478,"Some folks on this subreddit made [this wonderful guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3npea9QoEtCpQor8W25_VSJTgXuy6QgCEvt4FrHMvA/edit#gid=0). You can figure out what mAh value you need, and then compare weights and costs."
73479,"Has anyone here tried the 33store 10000 from that list? Seems like the lightest option, plus it comes with a built in cable for extra weight savings"
73480,You may want to consider carrying two 10000mah packs instead of one 20000mah packs if charging quickly in town is a priority. With a two-port charger you can charge twice as quickly.
73481,"Ya know, I thought about 2 small banks vs one big one. Let's me spread out weight backpacking, and is more versatile - don't have to bring both if I know I wouldn't need it.

But then I guess the main downfall I can think of is just logistically managing them and eventually realizing you forgot to charge one. Maybe not a real issue..."
73482,"2 x 10k mAh qc banks will take just about 4 hours to charge with a beefy 2 port wall plug. 2x 6.8oz plus at least 2.5oz plug for 16.1oz

A single 20k mAh power delivery 30W bank will charge in 3.5-4 hours. 12.8oz + 2.1oz for 14.9oz

So definitely not twice as fast. And the only 10k banks with power delivery that are out as of a month ago either weigh 11oz for 30W or take 3 hours to charge with 18W at about 7oz

The 40W 12k mAh PD bank that Huawei is coming out with is supposed to weigh around 9oz which may hit a sweet spot"
73483,"> A single 20k mAh power delivery 30W bank will charge in 3.5-4 hours. 12.8oz + 2.1oz for 14.9oz
> 
> 

Thanks for all your info. In this 20k example, which bank were you referencing? So many, and so many by even Anker alone! It also gets tough to really tell which are newer/better. #overwhelming"
73484,"Anker 20k PD was the one I was referencing. Couple months ago I dove down the rabbit hole of fast charging power banks when u/Happypnt posted about a 10k 30W PD bank and I wanted to see what else is out there with the goal to reduce time spent in town charging.

The Huawei one is intriguing but still not out yet to my knowledge, but should be any day now. Can charge 12k mAh allegedly in something like 2 hours 15 minutes. But comes in at like 8.8oz per website specs. Not to mention it's also like 130 bucks and you'd have to also buy a 40W PD charger that's gotta weigh at least 2.1 oz and a c to c cable that is rated to take the charge."
73485,"The Aukey 30,000 is a pretty awesome beast. I put their quality with Anker just not as well known. They have solid board design and components and compatible prices. A little more feature rich IMO."
73486,"Anker makes several 20,000 mAh, weighing 12 to 13 ounces. I once met a UL through hiker carrying TWO. This brings new meaning to UL."
73487,This kind of stuff blows my mind about UL.   I know people who are worried about 2 ounces of sleeping pad and are cutting up the zlites; and yet they will carry a pound of batteries.
73488,"Saw a documentary where a hiker didn't carry a tent because of the weight, yet had canned food in his pack!"
73489,I believe it.  I met an ULer last autumn who complained that he was way too cold but stubbornly wouldn’t budge on his 1.5 pound bag. I’m toasty in my 2.0 pound bag.  I’ll accept the extra with happiness. I guess for some UL means ultra lousy.
73490,"Makes perfect sense to me, if you remember that for some Ultralight = Ultra efficient.  It's about being able to spend more time on trail.  If you want to walk all day, everyday, (or if your hiking style is camera heavy, or you're on a tight budget) there's a sense of freedom that comes with not having to concern yourself about battery status.   

2 20k mAh powerbanks still sounds ridiculous though."
73491,worn weight.
73492,My wife and I also used Anker 20k banks on the JMT. We were watching episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Wes Anderson movies every night on our phones. It was awesome.
73493,"This one below is 15kMaH and is on my target upgrade list. Might be a good pick. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HBWF1K8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9HjYCbHW7XW4G"
73494,"Hmm, interesting - looks like just about 50% more weight for 50% more capacity, plus bonus charging port.

I sort of assumed of jumping to a 20,000 size... but might have to think about this! :)"
73495,"The dual ports are essential for me, as I want to be able to charge my phone & inReach Mini at the same time."
73496,"Couldn’t agree more! I’ve got the earlier version of this one, and always bring it with me on trips. It’s incredibly valuable to charge my phone, inreach mini, watch & headlamp in pairs, instead of one at a time."
73497,I got a Xiaomi 20k for \~25€. 330g. Quickcharge 3.0 both ways.
73498,"If price is an issue, I bought one of these beasts locally for about 15 bucks. I didn’t think it would last, but almost a year later (taking it out nearly every week) it’s still around. At first I thought the cigarette lighter feature was a stupid gimmick. But it could be useful as a fire starting tool I suppose. Being some random China made company, I have my doubts if it’s really 20000mah. I’d love to test it if I knew how. 

https://www.amazon.com/15000mAh-Charger-Cigarette-External-Flashlight/dp/B07HQKYVNC

If price doesn’t matter and you want something rock solid, then I’d prob pass on this."
