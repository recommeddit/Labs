31623,"Every time I traveled abroad, I stayed in AirBnBs or tiny places with a ton of character.  It never cost that much, and it's much more worth it to us to have a cool place than a ton of luxuries.  Our favorite, so far, has been [Tashitakge in Lhasa](https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/lhasa-babao.html).

I do travel a fair bit around the US for work, and as a solo-traveler, and I get comped a lot of suites (I guess they know as a single traveler, they know I won't ever pay for it, while a family of four might spring for it?).  By far, my favorite hotel in the US is the Adolphus in Dallas.  Ton of character, amazing bar, great gym, even the regular rooms are huge, has a great coffee shop and barbershop attached, it's right in the middle of the city.  It kind of makes other US hotels, even 4-5 star ones, seem kind of dingy."
31624,"Seems like everyone is listing hotels in Asia but since I’ve never been ill have to go with grand hotel des trois rois, in Basel Switzerland. Also had a chance to dine at their three star Michelin restaurant, Cheval Blanc by Peter Knogl

Or the Cambrian Adelboden, also in Switzerland. A spa hotel built into the Swiss alps"
31625,I don't think I saw Eden Roc or Cap Estel here yet.
31626,"Park Hyatt Paris

Park Hyatt Vienna

Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria in Sorrento"
31627,The Breakers West Palm Beach
31628,"Hm. This one is a tie between the Taj Exotica Andamans and Las Alcobas in Mexico City.

The Lodhi in Delhi had excellent rooms and food (Indian Accent!), but the service was so-so. I’m not sure if that was just a one-off though.

My go-tos in India are either Taj, Oberoi, or Leela properties. Most of their properties outside of India are pretty great — the Taj Compton Place is a notable exception. For ROA, Peninsula and Aman properties are awesome."
31629,Grand Melia in Greece!
31630,"Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Waldorf. Surprised these are not mentioned here."
31631,All except Waldorf were mentioned multiple times before you made your comment
31632,Is this even a FatIRE thread anymore with questions like this?  Probably best asked in a Hotel subreddit
31633,"Do you pretend like you're a recluse king, with maids and shit?"
31634,"Once  everyone knows who you are and that your stay is indefinite they are pretty much at your service and will do anything for you.  As I get to know the staff I actually find myself sympathizing with them and trying to reject any pampering.  I park my own car, carry my luggage and only have my room cleaned once a week."
31635,Does work pay for your hotel or is it out of pocket?
31636,Hotel and meals are paid for.  I sold my car and townhouse a few years ago so I have no bills.
31637,Meaning you're raking in fierce amounts of cash?
31638,What if you get fired from your job?
31639,Travel the world
31640,"Walk the earth, like Caine from Kung fu?"
31641,Theres a word for that: bum. He'll be a bum.
31642,The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
31643,"Go from town to town, meet people, have adventures?"
31644,"Upvote, simply for knowing about *Kung Fu*.

Nobody that I know of is aware that ""the guy from *Kill Bill*"" did anything other than that."
31645,"He'll have to rent a place, or go on Deadliest Catch."
31646,"Which hotel? How many points do you have? I assume you are top tier status, what perks do you get?"
31647,"I stay in the Hilton Family.  I have close to 1 million points (I've only been doing this a few years).  I rank #6 in all-time stays at my current Hotel.  Believe it or not there are a few people that have been living here for more than 2 years.  The main perks just have to do with building relationships with the staff.  I can get any request attended to immediately.  I don't wait in line, etc.  Basically, the rules don't apply to my like they do the other guests.  This is my home.  Occasionally, there are other people from my company that pass through.  Once the staff knows they're with me they can get any room, late checkout, etc.  No questions asked. Oh, and I've gotten offered free tickets to local events (theater, sports)."
31648,Hilton expires after one year of no activity. Are you planning on trying to use them all after work is done? Are you keeping a residence somewhere? Are you saving tons of money doing this?
31649,"Are you saying that if I don't use my points in a year, they expire?  My plan was to save them until I quit and then travel for a year or two with them."
31650,"No, sorry. If you don't stay at a Hilton within a year, they will expire. You can get them restored once but that's it. I just did this."
31651,"Huh?

Didn't you just say that the points won't expire as long as he books at least one room per year?"
31652,"That's what I meant to write but he originally took ""activity"" to mean using points and not booking rooms. Now I'm confused. What are you confused about? Ouch, my head."
31653,"Are you saying booking a room with points does not reset the expiration date?  So he has to book at least one room a year with cash, while using points for everything else?"
31654,Ah. That I don't know.
31655,"Keep in mind that Hilton typically raises the amount needed to redeem points every few years (Cat 6s were 40k points just two years ago).  I wouldn't recommend hoarding points.  Use them as often as you can.

Also, you only have $1m?  I would think you would have more than that.  Get the HH AMEX Surpass card also if you don't already have it."
31656,What kind of work do you do that would cause you to have to travel so extensively?
31657,"I work for a company that builds and installs industrial equipment all over the U.S.  They send me out for all kinds of reasons (watch something get installed, diagnose a problem, talk to a client, run equipment and take data) you name it.  I'm have a unique position at the company in that I'm versatile in my knowledge and willing to go anywhere, so there's always something they want me to look at."
31658,"Do you ever stay at a hotel while staying at a hotel, xzibit style? (i.e. staying in hotel in town X but have to make a couple day trip to town Y a few towns over and get a hotel there too)"
31659,All the time.
31660,Your life is a M.C. Escher of hotels.
31661,"Yo dawg, I herd u liek staying at hotels, so we put a hotel in ur hotel so u can collect reward points while you collect reward points."
31662,"I don't think hotel staying works like that. You can only exist in one hotel at a time.

Only exception: hotel blanket forts."
31663,Hotel within a hotel. Innception.
31665,"When I take off from work, I travel overseas for vacation.  I love to travel."
31666,Do your hotel points also pay for travel expenses like tickets?
31667,I don't know.  I just max out the hotel and air points.  Not sure how creative I'm able to get otherwise.
31668,Sounds like you are almost irreplaceable!
31669,"For now, but a company will never see it that way."
31670,does it get lonely? scary?freaky? do you ever miss home?
31671,You really have to like being by yourself.  I eat dinner every night at a restaurant alone but sometimes sit at the bar and talk to the staff.  You basically are alone and develop casual relationships with people.  I love to read so I don't really mind but occasionally get the blues.  I miss home quite a bit since that's where friends and family reside.  I try to fly back one weekend a month.  As far as scary or freaky....no.
31672,"my stepdad was like you way back before he met my mom and this comment ""As I get to know the staff I actually find myself sympathizing with them and trying to reject any pampering."" that's like him talking. I hope you enjoy it though i think it's something nice to do every once in a while, i like being alone haha, anyway i hope you post some pictures of the room i'm just curious"
31673,Why don't you stay at an [extended stay hotel](http://homewoodsuites1.hilton.com/en_US/hw/index.do)? They have kitchens and everything. Designed for people who are going to be there for some time.
31674,What do you do for fun? Go watch a movie? Go to the opera? Walk in the park? Roller coasters?
31675,All of the above plus bars and reading.
31677,Surely if you're been in a town for a year you must have made some friends.
31678,I've made a bunch of acquaintances.  Sometimes I'll be invited to a party or something.  Maybe I'm a little anti-social or something but I think there is a threshold in a relationship where nothing can ever be awkward and it takes almost no energy to have a good time.  I've never reached that with anyone other than a few people.  The rest of it feels like a lot of work to keep the night going.  But I'm a good listener when I want to be and most of the time I'm just hearing people's stories.
31679,"Jesus, you sound like me talking."
31681,"Have you been in the same room all this time or have you swapped them, for a change?

How much stuff do you have?

Have you asked for any changes in furnishings?"
31682,"Same room.  I'm thinking of changing Hotel chains altogether just for a drastic change, but it will hard leaving this place.  It's home and the staff is excellent.  I have a bag of clothes, a laptop, a guitar and a shit ton of books.  I seem to buy them constantly.  When I check out of a place, I'm usually mailing a box of books back home.  I've never asked for changes in furnishings.  I'm not sure what they would change it to."
31683,Have you ever rearranged the furniture just for fun?
31684,I thought about that.  I'm going to do it this week.  I'd appreciate any other ideas or pranks.  Things get boring sometimes.
31685,"There was this radio/tv show in Norway that went to a hotel for a night and took apart all the furniture, like taking out the screws and lining them all over the room.

The rest of this story is that a while after, the same guys calls the hotel and asks if they can stay at it another night. The staff says sure, and when they come, the staff has taken the room apart just as they had done earlier."
31686,I love Scandinavian culture/society/attitudes.
31687,Where do you mail your books to if you sold your townhouse?
31688,good question.  My library is kept at my brother's house.
31689,Might I suggest a kindle to resolve your shit ton of books dilemma?
31690,"Kindles are sweet, but there are some people (myself included to some degree) who just love the feeling of turning the page, holding something paper in your hand, etc.

Edit: I've only used a Kindle once, and could definitely see myself using it for vacations as the OP was talking about."
31691,might be a patch for that
31692,"This is starting to sound like a VHS vs. DVD or CD vs. MP3 conversation. I don't care what the natural progression is, I love the feel of books!"
31693,real books can't run out of batteries.
31694,He lives in a hotel. An outlet to charge his kindle shouldn't be too hard to come by.
31695,"Where is ""back home""?   Do you have a house/apartment?"
31696,Texas.  I had a house and car but I sold it.  I'm trying to push the boundaries of minimalism.
31697,Have you read Lee Child's Jack Reacher series? You may be interested :)
31698,"Hell yeah, definitely check this out."
31699,"Is Texas still your legal state of residence, or are you having to pay tax in whatever state you're currently in?

(Texas: No state income tax!)"
31700,"You should look into getting an e-book reader if you read that many books, I know some people like having the physical books, but it would save you the hassle of having to ship them when you move around."
31701,"""Back home"" - is that your parents?

Dude, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If all you need is a change, go camping for a week. You'll love the hotel when you get back to it."
31702,">You'll love the hotel when you get back to it.

Or maybe he won't, and he'll become [Christopher McCandless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_mccandless)."
31703,Married or single and mingling?
31704,Definitely single.  Tried to keep a girlfriend back home while doing this...impossible.
31705,"Are you mingling though?

Do you know the area well now?  What do you do?  How do ladies feel about you living in a hotel?"
31706,"Ah, another good question.  I know the area extremely well since I get bored easily and constantly try new things.  I go out about 3-4 times a week to bars but mostly on the weekdays since I hate crowds.  I have found it hard to start seeing women when on the road.  For starters, they always tell me that going back to a hotel makes them feel like a whore.  Secondly, they know you're there temporarily and regardless of how easy going they seem after two weeks they want to know ""where is this going?"".  I like meeting new people, but nothing ever lasts.  Sometimes that's upsetting because I've met some really cool girls."
31707,">I have found it hard to start seeing women when on the road.


Unless you're George Clooney."
31708,Didn't end well for him either
31709,That movie made me sad.
31710,I'm surprised. I was a P/A/-S/A road warrior in my 30s-40s and found many women were happy to date men who were only on site for 6-12 months.
31711,Craziest hotel story?
31712,None I was directly involved in but I was surprised that at least one room every weekend is evicted.  People throw loud parties or try to fit 50 people in a room.  Once a couple was evicted for having sex outside their room.  For a while there was a young woman who was a long term guest that every night would hang out at the bar and bring married men travelers up to her room.
31713,">...a young woman who was a long term guest that every night would hang out at the bar and bring married men travelers up to her room


They're called hookers"
31714,">They're called hookers

Please. They're hired companions.

    We only call them hookers when they're dead and in the trunk of a car..."
31715,"""She's a call girl!""
""NO CYRIL, when they're DEAD they're HOOKERS!"""
31716,"I really don't want to up vote you, but still felt compelled."
31717,"Please, try to be a gentleman. They're called ""ladies of the evening."""
31718,What are your actual personal expenses?  How much of your paycheck (percentage-wise) can you directly deposit into your bank account?
31719,"If I wanted to and was disciplined enough it could be 100% since my meals are paid for.  However, I like to drink so I keep a few scotch bottles handy and rack up a bar tab a few times a week.  I am a minimalist and object to buying new things but have a huge weakness for books.  I also like to live life to fullest so any chance I get to have fun whether it is on the road or at home it's usually pretty lavish and extreme.  That being said I probably save 75% of my pay."
31720,"This might be kinda off topic.

But have you thought of getting a Kindle or Nook or some other e-reader? You say you end up sending so many books by mail ""back home"" when you leave, and try to be a minimalist(which I greatly admire, I'm in the process of decluttering).

Would an ereader help with this? One single item, no shipping, etc."
31721,"I had the Sony when it first came out because it allowed PDFs.  I thought 'hey, I can save on clutter and on money by just downloading books.'  I don't really like them.  They are good for a vacation.  Since I like to read multiple books at one time it's great not to have my backpack overloaded when I'm on a trip.  But to me there is something about them that falls short over the long term.  I love having the book in my hand.  Also most of the stuff I read is non-fiction so I'm constantly dog-earing and re-referencing material.  It still is a battle though, especially if I get free wikipedia with the Kindle.  Tempting."
31722,You might want to check the paper book versus Kindle book prices for the paper books you happen to buy as the friends I know who have one have been bitterly disappointed at how the paper books are generally cheaper.
31723,"Do you know if they are comparing used or new paper vs electronic? Also, is that more the exception or the norm?"
31724,">That being said I probably save 75% of my pay.

As I struggle to figure out a way to pay a $1,500 retainer this week I just wanted to say I hate you.

(I really don't. I'm just incredibly envious.)"
31725,That's cool! how big is your room? can you share any pictures of it?
31726,"It's a suite, so probably about twice the size as a 'normal' hotel room.  It has a living room with a couch, computer desk, dinner table and kitchen counter.  The bedroom is your typical setup.  I don't have any pictures and I'm not there now, but I can post some later if people are interested."
31727,We'd appreciate that.
31728,Makes it easier to fap to.
31729,"Do it, please!"
31730,"How do you survive on room service? I'm over it after a week. 

How's your weight? I'd die after 3 months of hotel food."
31732,"Books and Scotch. You, sir, know how to live."
31733,"Unrelated, but that picture and comment reminds me of a joke, ""A man walks into a bar. He is an alcoholic. It's killing him inside."""
31734,"Is that a bottle of Compass Box? 

Excellent taste."
31735,Looks like Embassy Suites
31736,"As a employee of a hotel, I'd enjoy hearing about the staff you've gotten to know."
31737,They are extremely warm and polite.  I've even hung out with them on occasion (which is against the rules).  They are just 20-22 year olds with bright dreams and much experience ahead of them.  They all want to do bigger and better things.  I like hearing people's stories.
31738,This all sounds very familiar. Thanks.
31739,"I work for a big hotel chain and I have got to say, this is the impression we try to leave on all of our guests"
31740,"> I've even hung out with them on occasion (which is against the rules).

Why exactly is it against the rules?"
31741,I'm curious too haha.
31742,"Do you now know any hotel ""secrets""?  Like the extra pillow comment, but more."
31743,"Well, one that comes to mind is that if a hotel says they don't allow animals they have to allow ""service animals"" and they specifically cannot question you about it.  I see a lot of ""service"" chihuahuas."
31744,"There actually are alternate service dogs for stress and such, which are universally small lap-dog type breeds.  How much is hype by the patients I don't know, but this is a real thing.  I know of one MS patient who has one."
31745,Which one are you? Zack or Cody?
31746,He's Dunston.
31747,"I have no idea who it is, my step son watches it."
31748,I loved that chimp :)
31749,Do you make your own hours?
31750,"Technically, yes, I manage my own time but it is dictated by the task(s) at hand.  Some days it is more efficient to stay in and do paperwork, some days I work at the site until midnight, sometimes I have a scheduled meeting with a client or contractor, etc.  That's kind of a perk, I usually work long hours but for the most part they are how and when I chose to manage them."
31751,"Do you get paid by hours on the job or yearly/fixed for ""gigs""?"
31752,"Initially it was hourly, but now I'm salary.  Still make roughly the same but now I'm more aware of fitting all daily activities into 8 hours, before it didn't matter."
31753,"Are you just living out of one suitcase, or do you try and make the hotel a bit more homely?

How long do you think you will be doing this job for?"
31754,One suitcase.  I like to keep it light.  I think I'd be hard pressed to be doing this another 2 years.   The lifestyle just weighs on you.  I'd like to see more of the world and work on things that interest me.
31755,"On one hand this sounds like the most awesome job ever, basically. 

But on the other hand...it does sound very lonely and very stagnant. If I lived in California I would come visit you and give you this hug that I feel so compelled to give. 

You should try to find some redditors in the area to have a drink with one night. Make some casual friends. :)"
31756,"So I've traveled quite a bit, but never 7 days a week permanently.  I did Monday or Sunday through Thursday every week for two years (been working locally for a few months).  I was comforted by coming back home to all of my ""stuff"" - my bigger tv, my desktop computer, the beer in my fridge, and my friends.  

Do you have any personal stuff in your room?

The thing I hate most about hotels is that there is no personalization.  It's just corporate crap - generic artwork, plastic counters.  Eventually, the small things start to get on your nerves - a frayed edge on a towel, a small spot on your carpet, the internet being too slow, getting a room that isn't facing a good direction.  I would get sick of going out, then get sick of room service.  

All that being said, I'm trying to get back on the road again soon.  I can't stand the idea of losing my airline or hotel status :)"
31757,"Yes!! The small things do get on your nerves... or at least get noticed.  I can tell you exactly which pillows are better, which door knob is loose, and which shower head is better compared with the rooms I've stayed in.  It's surprising."
31758,"Do you have crazy shenanigans with your twin brother? Jk, in all seriousness, do you enjoy it?"
31759,"That's hard to answer.  My close friends and I have had extensive discussions on the pros and cons.  It's definitely a double edged sword.  I'm lucky to have a job that pays for me to see other parts of the U.S. while allowing me not to have any bills and save money.  That is huge!  Also, I'm a minimalist so I do enjoy having a few things in a small place that is clean.  Most are the cons are obvious, no girlfriend, no hanging out with friends whenever you want.  There are many sacrifices.  Plus, something that gets overlooked is that when you are on the road for work you pretty much LIVE the job.  You work as the schedule demands and when you're ""off"" work, you're fielding calls and sending reports.  They don't send you out here to have a good time.  It would be hard to do this for more than 4-5 years.  I justify it by telling myself it's a means to save money quickly to jumpstart me into doing what I really want to do."
31760,What is it that you really want to do?
31761,Pursue my own interests.  I haven't narrowed it down yet but I'm fascinated by the subject of Cognitive Science.  Plus I want to spend a year or two traveling the world.  Eventually I will sign up for the Peace Corp. but I'm not in a rush since they take seniors now.
31762,"1. Notice how similar you seem to George Clooney in p in the Air?

2. Ever shine a black light in those rooms?"
31763,"1.  That movie got me to briefly concentrate on memberships and points, but I fell out of it.  I'd like to focus my energy elsewhere.   Great film though.  I thought it should have gotten praise for the script.
2.  I'd be afraid to.  First thing I always do is buy Lysol spray and wipes.  I hit the whole room and throw the comforter on the floor (they don't wash those things)."
31764,So does your comforter just live on the floor?  Or did you actually put it away and they just don't make up the bed with it anymore?
31765,It's half way at the foot of the bed and on the floor.  It still makes a good feet warmer but I don't want to get too close to it.
31766,"After living there extensively, why don't you ask them to bring/buy you a new one? (never been used I mean). Or, I guess you could always buy one yourself..."
31768,Yes.  Anything that I think I can get away with charging to the room.
31769,"Does your family live close by?
How do your holidays work out?"
31770,Nobody I know is close by but my company pays for flights back home every once in a while.  Holidays I either spend at home or traveling overseas.
31771,"Have you hooked up with any of the staff?

Where do you put all the towels and toiletries that you steal?"
31772,"Hmm.  I haven't, but it's really hard not to.  They are some of the hottest girls you will find.  But hooking up with them is way too close for comfort.  They see you come and go everyday (and bring someone home from the bar).  They could potentially make your stay hell.  It's worse than hooking up with someone from work.  At least then , you don't see them at night....As for toiletries.  It's hard to consider it stealing when there's an endless supply.

Edit: typo"
31773,"How do you pay for the hotel?  In other words, normally if you're staying at a hotel for three nights, you check in, give a credit card, and check out three days later.  I'm assuming in your case, they don't just wait until you're gone (a year) before charging you for your stay.  So how does it work?"
31774,They bill the card every $1000.
31775,Are you Alan Partridge?
31776,Do you ever cook meals in your hotel room?
31777,No. But I think I'm going to make an effort to start.  Sometimes the last thing you want to do at night is go out to find food.
31778,Does hilton have Residence Inn type places?  Those were a nice change.  Make a grocery list and the food will be there when you get back.  I always liked that.
31779,The hilton competitor to residence inn (upscale extended stay) is homewood suites
31780,Have you or your employers ever thought about or discussed the possibility of renting an apartment or house instead?  Would you prefer that?
31781,See other posts.
31782,"How do you stay in shape if you're constantly ""eating out""? I'm pretty sure the hotel food isn't that healthy.

Do you go to the hotel gym a lot?"
31783,"I vowed off exercise a few years ago.  After thinking about it, it seems like an enormous waste of time just to try and look a little bit better in someones eyes.  Now, I understand the health reasons and some people need to do it, but the average person needs a 20-30min walk a day and to eat healthy.  So that's what I do.  I walk a lot at work and eat healthy.  Seems fine and I stopped feeling guilty for not going to a gym."
31785,"couldn't you have someone stay and travel with you? Since your company pays for the room, travel, and foods, you could pay for theirs? Is that against hotel/company policy? 

Have you ever considered a pet?"
31786,"I've thought about that.  There's nothing against it other than they'd probably be bored during the day while I'm working.  I knew a guy that traveled with his girlfriend for a while.  I'm for it if I met the right person.

I'd love to have a dog, but I just don't have the time.  It would be unfair to the dog."
31787,How many times have you heard a couple going at it in a room near you?
31788,"Actually, that just happened for the first time last week.  The headboard slapping the wall woke me up."
31789,"I also live in a hotel in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic...didn't think people would be interested in a AMA about this. I also study tourism."
31790,You should do an AMA. :)
31791,Wouldn't even a halfway decent hotel room be prohibitively expensive? Or do the hotels offer long-term rates they don't advertise?
31792,"How much do you get paid?

How did you get this job?

What is your job?"
31793,"I gross about 100k/yr.  I just sort of fell into this job.  I graduated with an engineering degree and had some construction experience.  While working at a firm, the work was slow and my boss knew someone at my current company that needed an inspector for a short project.  My firm farmed me out contract and the company was so impressed with my work they hired me and and sent me on projects they were having issues on.  At first I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but eventually when you're sent out to solve a problem, you just figure it out."
31794,"I am mulling over a simular job, would you recommend this lifestyle?"
31795,"If you are content by yourself and are very independent.  I think it is great for saving money fast.  After all, freedom is bought."
31796,"So, would you say that you have a pretty suite life?"
31797,I had to look this up to figure out what everyone was talking about.  Who watches this crap?!
31798,"Kids.  College students that return home during the summer to babysit kids.  The people who run day care centers for kids.

I think you see what I'm getting at here."
31799,Kids?
31800,Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you and cheaper for your employer to just rent a small apartment?
31801,Wondering this too. There are plenty of apartment complexes that specially market for just this sort of thing...
31802,Oxford Suites comes immediately to mind. Rooms are just as nice and it would be a lot cheaper. Service may not be as lavish.
31803,Do you know any good human stories?
31804,Do wish you could live in a cooperate apartment?
31805,Not really.  One of the reasons I enjoy a modest and boring place is that I think people should just use it for sleeping.  I try to get out as much as possible and experience the world.  Even if it means just reading in a coffee shop.
31806,Does your room have a kitchen? Is it hard for you to eat healthy?
31807,"Not really, this room just has a counter with microwave, fridge and sink.  It was hard to stay healthy at first.  I had to eat smaller portions and cut out cheesy, cream-sauced meals when I eat out.  I stick to sushi and light meals."
31808,How much do you tip a chambermaid? Do you prefer to have your bedsheets tucked or untucked?
31809,I leave money out but they don't ever take it.  I guess I should ask.  I prefer the sheets tucked.

31816,How do you do laundry?
31817,Give it to the front desk.
31818,I want your job ;)
31819,This sounds like a dream job to me. I'm a very independent person and this seems like a great way to see the world.
72998,Thank you.
31822,"i did this for a few months, it was an experience. there were some comforts such as having a room that was nicer and cleaner than my own apartment, and having nice meals cooked for me every night. but the loneliness did me in and changed my perspective of hotels. i began to see the room as not so nice after all, as it had little niggly problems that a room that no one ever *lived* in would have. i began to question its cleanliness. and having heavy restaurant meals everyday lost its novelty. in the end i hated hotels and was glad to leave that job."
31823,"Exactly... You definitely know what you're talking about.  It's hard.  That is why most people aren't willing to do it.  Even myself, I can probably only take it a few more years."
31824,"i can't believe you can last as long as years. i only did 3 or 4 months and felt destroyed by the ordeal. i'm not sure what the problem was, as looking at my life now - a single guy alone in an apartment, it's not that different.

maybe you could do what one of the other posters suggested, and ask for a serviced apartment. at least then you wouldn't have to tell any prospective girls that you were only there temporarily, right away. ;)"
31825,Wow I was just considering doing one of these. I live in Residence Hotel so I can cook my own meals when I don't feel like going out. I've lived in my current hotel 2 separate times now for a total of 10 months. I've been working on the road for around 6 years total with a break of a couple years in the middle.
31826,Cool.  I've been thinking about moving to a residence hotel and cooking my own meals.
31827,"It is nice - I spent 6 months in a Holiday Inn in the middle of nowhere East Texas with only a mini-fridge and a microwave. It sucked. I love being able to cook meals, have leftovers, bake bread, and the option of just staying in available. This gig is only about 8 hours from my home so I drove up and brought more stuff with me, like cookware and my Xbox."
31828,"Hey, can you tell us more about your experience?  Like how did you get to doing what you're doing?  And you sound pretty young!"
31829,"I love Residence Inn by Marriott - and they treat their customers very well. Their points program is good, I prefer them to Hilton. And your hotel will feel more like an apartment and often you'll get your own private entrance instead of a long hallway of doors."
31830,"You like reading books, you say. Favorite author, or subject? Favorite book of all time?"
31831,"Here's what I have there now off the top of my head:
Richard Dawkins - The Ancestor's Tale;
Charles Bukowski - The Continual Condition;
Richard Feynman - What do you care what other people think;
Steven Pinker - How the Mind Works;
Christopher Hitchens - The Portable Atheist;
Rudolph Rocker - Anarcho-Syndicalism;
Bertrand Russell - A History of Western Philosophy;
Eric Davidson - The Gunk Punk Undergut;
Leonard (Something) - The Drunkards Walk;
Noam Chomsky - (Something on Latin America);

I know there's more, but that's a good start.  My favorite book is probably Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut.  It's the only book that after finishing it I immediately started over and read it again."
31832,"I usually stayed on the strip and just bought shuttle passes. The shuttle works pretty well. You just park your car at the World Market Center (I think that's the name) on first day show your printout and they give you a wristband for all 3 days. Pretty hassle free.

This year decided to stay at the Main Street Station and going to walk to the venue. I have stayed at the Downtown Grand before and it is a nice hotel. There is an awesome pizza spot across the street (forgot the name)"
31833,Definitely gonna hit the pizza spot up lol
31834,Evel Pie! Best pizza in downtown
31835,"I think the one I went to was [Pizza Rock](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-rock-las-vegas?osq=pizza)

But will try Evel Pie this LiB"
31836,Friends of mine stayed at The D in downtown fremont area. It was legit and price was affordable for last years festival.
31837,Any on Fremont or surrounding area are fine. We've stayed all the way down to golden gate and even then did not find the walk to annoying at the end of the night.
31838,How much did it cost??
31839,"That was 2 years ago and around $100 a night. I don’t remember for sure. This year staying at FourQueens and it was $121 Canadian a night. But it literally jumped 70$ a night 12 hours after we booked.

If you don’t mind Uber/lyfting. Stratosphere is dirt cheap."
31840,"I've stayed at the Golden Nugget for the past few years, and this year my group decided to try the downtown grand. Looks like if you book there you'll be able to attend the LIB pool parties too if that's something that interests you?"
31841,I’m definitely getting tickets this year for sure! First time at LiB. But are these pool parties worth it? And what time does the actual festival start/ end?
31842,"To be honest, no idea about the pool parties. I know capitol cities was there last year. Fest opens around 2 and ends at 1."
31843,"Last year Capital Cities played a show at the Downtown Grand pool that started at 10am. You didn't have to be staying at the Downtown Grand to go, nor did staying at the Downtown Grand guarantee you a ticket. They gave away wristbands on a first come first serve basis on Friday. If you got a wristband, you got to go to the show.

I believe this is the only time the festival has done something like this. They have done pool parties at The Plaza in past years, but not with a band playing the festival. Technically, you did have to be staying at The Plaza to attend, unless someone staying there could get you in.

If LIB does anything like this again this year, it will be announced close to the festival."
31844,Never been but super stoked to attend this year.  Is staying on the strip a real hassle to and from each night?  Seems like staying within walking distance downtown is the way to go.
31845,"I'd recommend staying downtown. Nothing can beat being able to walk back to your hotel each night. Also, you have the option to go back to your hotel during the festival, which is pretty sweet."
31846,When I stayed at the golden nugget it was definitely fun. Right after festival you can just walk straight down Fremont and party on for a bit longer. I just booked my room at the Downtown Grand. Trying to get the perks of the pool party
31847,"Stayed at Hilton on boulevard last year and loved it, although spent 100$ on ubers over the weekend and didn't use any ins and outs either. 

Staying at Oasis at gold spike this year. Anyone have any stories/reviews/tips?"
31848,In the last I’ve stayed at the El Cortez and walking right out the door and to the gates was amazing. Last year there was a bit more of a walk but still very close. Room was decent. Price was worth the convenience ~$500 4 nights.
31849,My group stayed at “the D” last year. Was one block away from the entrance. Got our same room last week!
31850,How big was your group? Got 12 of us going. We reserved at the El Cortez but looking to switch. Wondering about sleeping arrangements and whether we can book 3 rooms with 2 beds each or absolutely need to book 6 rooms? I read the El Cortez is strict with how many people stay in each room.
31851,Last year we packed 6 in a 2 queen bed room. 3 in each bed.
31853,"yeah the D and the Grand are closest/best hotels with casinos and are both pretty fun. You might check out the Oasis at the Gold Spike too, even closer and more of a boutique feel, with a big night club/outdoor games/ bar experience next door."
31854,"I've stayed at Cabana Bay, Royal Pacific, and Portofino Bay. If you don't mind spending the extra money, I loved Portofino. It is a stunning hotel, and we loved the pool there as well. My second favorite was Royal Pacific, the theme is so well done."
31855,"Here are the hotels I’ve stayed at, in the order I’d rank them (without considering express):

1) Hard Rock - proximity to the parks is awesome. Nice rooms, hotel doesn’t feel huge and very easy to navigate.

2) Cabana - Love the vibe here more than any other hotel. If the hotel footprint weren’t so huge it would probably be my number 1.

3) Portofino - I’d argue the best theming of any hotel. It really does feel like you’re in another country standing on your balcony overlooking the bay. Much longer walk to the parks than the other big two hotels.

4) Sapphire - I know people love it here, but it was just ok for me. Given that it’s the most expensive non-express hotel, I’d rather just go with a value resort and maximize savings or spend more on a premier hotel. Most crowded water taxis since other non-water taxi hotels walk over and use theirs.

5) Surfside - last in my rankings of the hotels I’ve stayed at, but not bad at all. Stayed here with five other adults in a 2 BR and it was very comfortable, nice and clean. Would recommend if you wanted to maximize savings."
31856,"I’ve stayed at Royal Pacific, Hard Rock, and Surf Side so I can’t speak for the whole spectrum. I can say Surfside was a beautiful hotel for a value. Bus service was easy and frequent. Really enjoyed my stay there.

I personally prefer the HR or RP for the short walk to City Walk and faster security (usually a walk-up). Both hotels have beautiful scenery and theming as well as great restaurants. At that point it becomes a matter of preference if you prefer a pacific tropical theme or artsy music vibes. RP is usually a little cheaper if that matters."
31858,"If your plan is to buy the passes, you are better staying at a hotel that offers them. You can save a lot of money. I’ve only stayed at the Royal Pacific and I very much enjoyed my stay."
31859,"I’m more interested in the opinions of the hotels themselves rather than the express pass benefit, but I appreciate your advice"
31861,"I would agree with this order.  I enjoyed the Royal Pacific. It was a nice hotel, included express pass, and was cheaper. Portofino Bay is amazing, but obviously more expensive. It depends on your budget. If you want to spend the money then hands down Portofino Bay is the best. I prefer the theming of Royal Pacific over Hard rock."
31862,"It depends, sometimes express might be cheaper if you’re a pass holder"
31863,"Out of the resort hotels I've only stayed at Cabana Bay, but I absolutely loved it! The 50s/60s theming is amazing, it has a lazy river, two big pools, bowling, an arcade, fitness center, etc. It's definitely not a fancy hotel, more casual, but a really great value for your money. The best part is the proximity to Volcano Bay, you can just walk over there."
31864,"I've stayed at Portofino, Royal Pacific, and Cabana Bay.  Would rank them in that order.  The theming at Portofino, and the bay itself, are just amazing."
31865,"Only stayed at Royal Pacific, others have mentioned most of the pros but military and veterans can get bumped up to club level which includes snacks and meals throughout the day as well as passes to the gym."
31866,"I’ve stayed at Portofino, Hard Rock and Cabana Bay. Here’s my best to worst ranking:

Portofino- Hands down the most luxurious and relaxing. You’re transported to another place when you come back from a long day at the parks.  It’s nice and quiet and the pools are great. They also just renovated the rooms. 

Cabana Bay - the theming is great and atmosphere is a lot of fun. My only complaint was it’s long distance from the parks (no water taxi) and thin walls. 

Hard Rock - I stayed in a club level room here and honestly was not impressed. I thought the hallway, room and club lounge looked quite dirty for what you’re paying. The rock theme is cool and you can’t beat the closeness to the parks but I deeply regretted not stating at Portofino again."
31867,"Cabana Bay was our first on-site hotel. The room was really nice (tower room) and didn’t hear anybody staying next to us. We had a parking lot view, but it was still a pretty view at night looking out at Orlando. 

We liked it so much, we are planning on staying there again in November unless we decide to splurge and get one that offers express passes."
31868,"Currently, daily express passes are more expensive than staying at one of the hotels that offers it as a perk. And generally speaking, if there is more than one person in your party, the hotels are always the cheaper option.

That said,  I also prefer Cabana Bay. I always stay in a room that is closer to Volcano Bay than to the resort pool!"
31869,"Cabana was trash, hardrock #1, portofino was nice, royal pacific was decent, if you don’t care about price then hardrock all the way"
31870,"We’ve stayed at every resort multiple times (except for sapphire falls) and we adore the Hard Rock. From the proximity to the parks to the best pool on site, along with an amazing staff, it’s almost impossible to beat the experience."
31871,"I'll compare the two I've stayed at... I'm a parent with 3 kids, so your needs may be different.

Cabana Bay is my favorite.  Nice pools, and the food court is really quick and reasonably priced.  We also like the family suites for the space.  And this is the place to stay if you plan to spend a lot of time at Volcano Bay, because it is much less convenient to get there from anywhere else.

Hard Rock is nice, the beds are comfy and the pool is fun.  You can't beat the walk to the parks, which is great if you want to get there early or leave at closing.  We found the food to be really good.   It's not as laid-back as Cabana Bay, but definitely ""nicer""- we stayed a few nights only because of the included express pass- for a family of 5, the hotel room was much cheaper than buying EP."
31872,"I'm going to sneak a piggy-backed question in here maybe someone can help.  I have a couple of questions about Hard Rock, check in is at 4pm.  I have a park ticket for that first day, can I take advantage of the express pass the day of, or do I have to wait for the day following check in?  Also, can I leave my luggage with them to take to my room when it's ready while I'm in the park?"
31873,"Yes, your express pass is valid on the day you check in and the day you check out. You can drop your luggage, get your pass, and head to the parks if your room isn’t ready."
31874,"Awesome, thank you for the info!"
31875,For 2 weeks if you are interested in only going to Universal I would recommend Hard Rock or Portofino Bay. If you are renting a car and looking to do a bunch of different things in Orlando like visit Disney etc. I would recommend either staying at Universal and the other location for the days you are visiting or going to a hotel off property like Drury Inn. If you are renting a car 2 weeks of parking at Universal will cost you around $22 per day. Drury has free parking. Drury offers a shuttle to Universal. If you rent a car and stay off property you will be paying for parking at the theme parks.
31876,"Most hotels will have a monthly rate they don't advertise. You usually won't see this on websites, so it's better to call in advance (if you can), or if you're really ballsy, just find a hotel upon arrival, walk in, and ask if they have a monthly rate.

Maybe it's less common with high-end luxury hotels, but places that are more low to mid range (and seldom fully booked) will usually be pretty happy to cut you a small discount for the extra business.

As an example, one of the places I stayed at in central Vietnam was $10 a night for a very nice double room with an en-suite bathroom. Their discount was 2 free nights for every 10 days booked, so I was able to get a ~$300/mo room for $240."
31877,"Most high-end luxury hotels definitely will do this as well, plus it is usually not hard to get what are normally crazy expensive options (like laundry) tossed in.  I recommend asking for laundry, club lounge (if this is an option at the hotel), breakfast, and percentage off of hotel dining/room service.  My experience is maybe 10% of luxury hotels don't feel the need to discount long term stays.  I would add, be sure and do your research first, certainly one big reason ""high-end luxury hotels"" discount is that they are lacking compared to the competition.

It is also the case that brand loyalty can matter, if I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for three months and then switch to the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, this usually helps a lot.

I'd also recommend though that what is usually the best deal for the month are serviced apartments.  Most people are there for extended stays, and the standard pricing is often monthly.

Every city is different of course."
31878,"Would still cost north of 6 grand for the month just for staying at such places, tho."
31879,"I'd love to stay ar the Mandarin Oriental for a long period :)

Can I ask how much of a discount did you get on a long stay like that?"
31880,"20% off the base rate of the top standard room, guaranteed upgrade to a suite, plus 4 pieces of laundry daily, free breakfast, and 20% off dining in hotel restaurants or room service, spa or laundry."
31881,"Thanks for the answer.
So you mean you stayed at a suite for 80 % the price of a standard room if I understood you right?"
31882,"The priciest standard room (for the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for example, their cheapest room is the Deluxe Room (going for ~70,000 yen per night), their best room is the Mandarin Grand Room - going for ~85,000 yen per night), so I paid 80% of ~85,000 (the actual rate varied per day) to stay in an Executive Suite (which normally runs ~135,000 yen per night).  Not cheap, but great value in my opinion."
31883,I agree!
31884,"Great info, thanks! Assuming it wasn't the capital, was it a sizeable city?"
31885,">Assuming it wasn't the capital

Good guess, the capital hasn't been in central Vietnam for almost 100 years :D

This specific example was in Da Nang... I'd consider it a pretty sizable city, but it's not ungodly huge."
31886,"We did something very similar in Da Lat, Vietnam.  Everything is negotiable in person.  Not sure if they'd do that online, but a ""no"" won't kill you.

BTW, we really liked Da Nang. Plenty big enough for us, and had a very positive feel.  Bonus: we stumbled on the Asian Beach Games while we were there.  Great fun on China Beach."
31887,"I've rented hotel rooms by the month  a number of times. Usually the monthly rate works out to be 60 to 70 % of the daily rate for 30 days.  Note that many hotels and especially guest houses will charge you separately for electrical usage for a monthly rental.  Also, they may only provide limited room cleaning and linen replacement, if at all. Amenities such as daily bottled water, soap and toilet tissue are usually not included.  Internet access may also be charged as an add-on.  Make sure to nail down those details, especially what the electrical rate per unit is as some places will mark it way up.

If you do make a monthly deal and electricity is separate, ask to see your meter when you take occupancy and write down the reading, even better, take a photo of the dial.  Make sure rules and restrictions are clearly understood.  Can you have a hot water pot? A hotplate? What if a guest wants to stay a few days?

If they ask for a security deposit beyond the agreed upon rent, be very careful.  Make sure you make them explain and you understand the terms of the deposit. Do you get your deposit back when you turn in your key or do they have a one or two week ""processing time?""  Do a walk through of the room with them and take photos of everything in the room, especially any visible damage, scuff marks, stains or scratches on furniture from previous tenants and have them acknowledge it.

There are those  who once they get money in hand, don't like giving it back.  The hotel business has many such people."
31888,Ma boy is wicked smaaaaaaaht
31889,Do you like apples?
31891,Can you share some of your experiences in this regard?
31892,"Thank you for the info, this is great advice."
31893,how about them apples
31894,"I did it for a month, gets boring and small, started to feel like a prisoner in a VIP cell. Breakfast also sucked after the 1st week, always the same, meh...meh...meh. 



I went in to the lobby, asked for someone from Sales and negotiated a monthly rate, was expensive, but much cheaper than their daily rate. Cost around $900/month (I think) for the Doubletree Hilton in Yerevan, Armenia. Which is expensive for the city, I rented a small house with garden for $400ish/month in one the best neighborhoods there (near the head honcho's palace).



Would not recommend, unless there's a compelling reason, or its a posh hotel, and you get a nice deal, but don't expect much of a discount when the crowds are in."
31895,Thanks for the info and recommendation. Looking at off-season is a fantastic idea for finding a deal. I have a ton of incoming work so what I want is precisely a boring routine minus any household chores.
31896,Might be cheaper to rent an airbnb and pay a little extra to have their cleaner come in once or twice a week.
31897,"Yes, much cheaper. Even a serviced apartment would be cheaper for a similar standard."
31898,"It really depends on the hotel, though."
31899,"Philippines-2.5 months, 950 peso a night( think it was about £14 at the time, 420 a month).

I’d stayed before for short term and struck a deal with the owner. I think it was a 3*ish place. I stayed in a separate area next to I think the chef, still a lovely room and en suite, no different from the others. Great memories. No kitchen of course. Can be done"
31900,Weed included?
31901,Fraid not. I did get cheap motorbikes though. I was 25 and it was the best time of my life
31902,"The one downside to hotel living is that when the wifi bogs down because everyone is viewing porn or streaming netflix, you can't do anything about it, usually 4 pm in the afternoon to about 11 pm at night. I moved to a medium sized city in the US (Reno) and have stayed at a motel for longer than I thought, as I am in the process of buying a house, and its like $900 a month, no kitchen, although I have a hotplate (my own), microwave and a half-size refrigerator.  One brainiac brought in a propane camp stove and blew up his room (probably to cook a batch of meth, we guess). Back in the day, it was easier to get a kitchenette, but high insurance rates have made a lot of hotel owners remove the stoves and such. I discussed having my own direct internet cable put in, but the owner didn't want to mess with that. I worked years in construction and have stayed months/years at hotels and usually its a matter of asking when you check in for long term rates."
31903,"I stayed at a monthly hotel in Orlando for around three months. Ask them about monthly rates, they may have them, since you won’t be the only person living there. However, you MAY still be required to pay weekly anyway. 

One thing to watch out for in long term hotels If you’re on the lower price range is the cleanliness. I had to move three times before I settled in my final room because of bed bugs. When you get into the room, check the creases of the mattress thoroughly since weekly hotels do minimal housekeeping. 

Also have them change the linens after you arrive. Just trust me on that. 

Another thing to be careful of in the lower price range are junkies. They tend to frequent and live in extended stay hotels. Keep your door bolted when inside. When not there hide everything. Use the in room safe. Wear earplugs at night. 

When I stayed it was the Home Suite Home ( not actual suites, just regular ass hotel rooms lol the lies ) and I got a discount for working for the company I worked for so it was 125 USD a week. For normal people it was $150 a week. 

I also stayed in an extended stay for a month in Washington DC. It ended up being about $900. Came with a kitchen but nothing worked and no one wanted to fix it. People doing drugs and deals outside constantly and tricks but it honestly wasn’t bad, they kept to themselves and didn’t bother me. Still a little pricy but clean, no bed bugs!

Your other option which is much better because times are changing - Airbnb. They offer discounts for an entire month most of the time and can be roughly the same price. When I lived in Bangkok for 3 months, I stayed in an Airbnb and it was wonderful. Three months under 800 USD. A little studio with a kitchenette in a decent area near the sky train. 

I never would have stayed at an extended stay hotel if Airbnb had been around. If you can, try that first!"
31904,"Beware than in some countries, you’re not allowed to stay in a hotel for more than 30 straight days, as it basically becomes a long term accommodation. Though there are ways around this, for sure."
31905,"If you use [booking.com](https://booking.com) or similar try to enter exactly  7, 14 or 30 nights. Weekly/ bi-weekly / monthly rates may pop up that you never see if you enter a different amount of nights."
31906,I lived in a decent hotel in Hong Kong for 3-4 months a few years ago. The monthly rate was much much less than the nightly rate and not much more than renting an independent apartment long term. I forget the price but it must have been less than $3000 a month and that included daily breakfast. Was a suite type place with one bedroom and a living room off it. No kitchen. Just suited my lifestyle at the time.
31907,Which hotel was that?
31908,"I have a rental property in Canada that I rent through a company called Premiere Executive Suites.  They compete with hotels on price, but you get a furnished condo or similar, much more appropriate for long term stays.  Might be worth checking out something similar."
31909,"I’ve worked in hospitality for about 15yrs and managed a couple of hotels, generally they will be willing to offer discounted long term rates, best option is to call in and ask to speak with the reservations manager directly, hope this helps."
31910,"How much of a discount can you expect, in your experience?"
31911,"That depends on a few things, length of stay being a big one. But generally you could hope for anywhere between 10% and 40% off, depending on room type and demand. Larger hotels are generally more open to the idea and many will have arrangements with local colleges and businesses. Hope this helps"
31912,"It does, thank you!"
31913,"No problem at all. Just bare in mind the 40% is absolutely best case scenario ie. long term, off peak days and out of season."
31914,At a small hotel/homestay in Bali for over 6 months now got it down to £330pm (6mil rupiah).  Plenty of similar priced places here it's very cheap.
31915,"I've done it in Thailand repeatedly and loved it. 
I stayed in a little beach bungalow for three months once. This is quite awhile back and at that time got it down to eight dollars a night. I would even take short trips but kept the place and my stuff in it. You can make it nice, buy some flowers for yourself and put some trinkets down. Don't think I would like it per se in a luxury hotel, too impersonal. 
I have repeatedly done the same thing in a friendly guest house in Chieng Mai, usually for a month. I always look for a cozy place, usually a corner room with good light coming in. I call these rooms my bunkers. I like the solace and do extended yoga sessions and journal writing, reading etc. while there."
31916,"I did this near the beach in Vietnam. Was awesome. Found an awesome deal that included breakfast, a massive suite with a mini-kitchen, a king size bed, etc. Paid below $500/month but I believe it was a pricing mistake on Agoda, to be honest. Hotel was brand new."
31917,One thing on hotel living - breakfast. Most hotels offer poor quality carbs for breakfast and so if you want a protein rich breakfast you will need to eat out a lot as you will not have access to a kitchen. Main reason we never hotel more than a week.
31918,"I stayed in two business hotels in Hanoi (took a week vacation in between) for about 20 days each. They both offered discounts and cost about $20/night and included a nice buffet breakfast (enough that I could often skip lunch). Staff at both were great and helpful, particularly when the electricity/internet went out and I needed to scramble for a cafe."
31919,"I've never lived long term in a hotel, but I've lived semi-long term in a _hostel_ with a private room. Very similar experience, I imagine, except you get a little more community and people are more interested in interacting, and the staff is usually smaller so you can build lasting relationships that are a little more meaningful. Plus, you know, cheaper and you can work out a breakfast/lunch/dinner package and whatnot if your budget allows."
31920,"Some Alaskan hotels have a cheap monthly ""winter rate"" as tourism in the winter(October-April) slows down quite a bit.


Usually like $750-$1,000, and that's everything included."
31921,"Many states/countries don’t tax long term stays the same as hotel stays. Taking advantage of this can save you at minimum the taxes, plus more if you negotiate the room rate. I hope this helps!"
31922,"We stayed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month and paid $10 per night, but that was years ago. I can't remember how much a discount they gave us.

It's an OK city for that amount of time. It's got a lot of interesting things going on, even if it's not the greatest city in the world. 

On the plus side, there was terrific food that cost very little, especially French food and baguettes fresh from the oven several times a day.

On the minus side is security. There are a lot of scams, robberies, and worse going on. Our hotel neighbour from across the hall got shot in the leg and someone stole his car. We got pulled over by the police for a ""fine"" of $10, but we hadn't done anything wrong and they didn't write any tickets.

We didn't realize when we first booked our rooms that it was very popular among sex tourists. One of our fellow guests insisted I go to the brothel with him. I passed, but he still came back with two hookers. The bar served a drink called ""the volcano,"" which was vodka, Red Bull, and Viagra. 

A lot of the guests were longer-term too. The guy who got shot lived there for years. Other guests would come and pick up a ""girlfriend"" they'd play sugar daddy to for a few months every year."
31923,"""Extended Stay America"" is good for, well, America.   Last one I stayed at was just outside of Vegas. Definitely worth the price.  Basically a hotel suite at motel prices."
31924,"I just tried this and I can't believe anyone is recommending it. Extended stay America funnels you into some extended perks website. I've created an account, given my information, AND downloaded their useless app and I can't even get so much as a quote from these people.
Everything is fine until you make your account and then everything is locked off till you log in from a computer (I don't have one).
If you try not making an account it's just an endless cycle of trying to coerce you into doing it.
0/10 would not recommend"
31925,"try not being so butt-hurt when a customer service app doesn't work.  They have a phone number. You can mention it to em when you call.   Their service is hotel stays, so what if their technology app isn't up to par, they still offer quality rooms at low rates."
31926,"I'm not being butt hurt, just trying to save someone else the 30 mins I've wasted not getting any quotes from this company who is supposed to provide quotes.
Like, that's the trade off, right? I give my email so they can sell it for money and junk up my inbox, and they are supposed to provide quotes.
Instead, I have a 33mb app that doesn't do anything on my phone and new spam mail, and I still don't have any quotes. 
I feel like that's worth mentioning to anyone who is actually trying to find housing, as this has not provided any useful solutions in the time i have been trying to use it.
This is useful information that is relevant to the topic."
31927,"Not hotels sorry. But I've been some pretty good results when booking for 4 weeks or more on AirBnB. Sometimes up to 60% off. 
I've been travelling through LATAM for 4 months now and it's worked pretty well."
31928,"If you like a social experience, maybe consider a long-term stay in a private room at a hostel. If you enjoy that vibe, it could be the best of both worlds."
31930,"Only if you like cooking. I'd much rather have amazing local food sent to my door for a couple of dollars than spend hours shopping, cooking, and cleaning to eat my own mediocre food."
31932,How does not doing something I don't like and doesn't save me money make me lazy?
31933,Why do you care how people get their food?
31934,"Starwood has a good portfolio as well. Not as many properties as IHG, Hilton, or Marriott though."
31935,"I'm a fan and seek out SPG properties when I travel. That said, the Aloft in Overland Park, Kansas had terribly uncomfortable beds and for that reason I won't stay there again. Bummer because it was otherwise a great stay, but not worth the trouble if you can't sleep."
