5131,I used to only shop at HD until this spring. Ordered $2k worth of material and they only delivered 1/3 of it. So I waited a week for the other material to come. The driver drove up to my house and he refused to deliver because the road is too busy. Safety should be #1 so I dont blame the guy but the road isnt that busy and last week they delivered it and didnt say anything. Call up home depot and they said there was nothing they could do. Asked for a refund and they said they could only do refunds in the store. I recently went through chemo and didnt want to go into the store. So now I am waiting on getting my money back.... while lowes was able to help me out just fine. I dont get how if I buy something online they cant just refund my card.
5132,Lowes for 10% military discount. Better tool variety in Kobalt 24v family. Plus Home Depot fired that employee for chasing kidnapper and saving a little girls life. I don't care if he could have got hurt and violation policy. He saved a little girl. Now Lowes gets my money.
5133,"My dad is a contractor and he calls it ""blows"""
5134,"Yea. When I’m doing a project, I alternate the stores. Let’s me give the impression to the employees that I don’t forget nearly as much as I do!"
5135,"HD (3 miles): I like Rigid corded tools and Ryobi cordless, and the garden center is setup a more to my tastes. 
Menards (6 miles): The farthest away, but it has the largest selection of wood in stock and is usually cheapest. However it’s main area is organized by Alzheimer’s inflicted hoarder so it can be hard to find shit. Also usually the cheapest. 
Lowes (2 miles): Closest to me and they also have a veterans discount which generally brings prices in line with Menards prices. 

In the end it will depend on what the project is and if I happen to have any Menards rebates on hand. Since Lowe’s is close, for oh shit trips in the middle of a project I go there almost exclusively."
5136,"Depends. I like Lowes better... Store seems better laid out, more selection, better customer service. Plus they will deliver for free clarge items like a chest freezer, whereas HD won't. Many times Lowe's beats in price too.

The HD is an hour away but the Lowe's is two hours away. Maybe it's a regional thing. The Lowe's does also have a HD a few miles away as well, so they need to compete I'm sure."
5137,Lowe’s credit card gives you 5% off all purchases. HD just sends you offers to borrow money.
5138,"Home Depot is for ""raw materials,"" whether that's composite decking, a new shut off valve for the bathroom sink, or the tools needed to fix things.


Lowes is better for ""decor"" things. Bathroom hardware, light fixtures, ceiling fans, etc. I also got my patio furniture from Lowes."
5139,"Everyone here posting HD is why I go to Lowe’s. SO MANY LESS PEOPLE!

I’m able to walk around and actually pick out what I need instead of elbowing past people."
5140,Neither if possible. Local lumber yard and specialty supply houses
5141,"Ah....the question as old as time.  They are so comparable that it's hard to make a distinction really, but it really depends on what you are shopping for.

The Lowe's closes to me could have a friendlier staff, but I'll never forget that after hurricane Katrina, when it was difficult to even get out of my neighborhood because there were so many trees blown down and blocking the roads, it was Lowe's that was going door-to-door passing out free blue tarpaulins to people that had holes in their roofs.  That sort of thing makes an impression on a person in time of need."
5142,Neither if I can avoid them. I prefer Menards for the selection and price. Just a better store imo.
5143,"Random fact, owners of HD and Lowe’s used to be married. Now divorced


https://www.lowesemployees.com/home-depot-lowes-owners-finalize-divorce/"
5144,"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-lowes-down/


 No"
5145,"Lowes, because it is 5 minutes drive closer to my house."
5146,"Lowe’s, because it’s 7 minutes closer to my house. And the parking lot at HD has a shitload of speed bumps."
5147,Lowe’s because it’s walking distance around the corner from my house.
5148,Lowe's because I literally live under a stack of old pallets in the garden section (don't tell.the manager!)
5149,"Lowes has better customer service, but Home Depot seems to have a better selection"
5150,"Agree with this. Every time I go to Lowes they're always very helpful and it's easy to find someone. I never get that great of consumer service at Home Depot, even when buying large purchases like appliances."
5151,The lighting is nicer in Lowes.
5152,This is the third time I've seen that in this thread.  I need to pay more attention.
5153,"Recently Lowes has better curbside pickup, good luck with Home Depot’s"
5154,"I prefer Lowe's because they're closer to my house.

I prefer Home Depot because it's generally better stocked than the Lowe's near my house."
5155,"Both, I go to Lowe’s for everything. I go to Home Depot for everything that I bought with a warranty before the Lowe’s opened up."
5156,"I hear a lot of people say HD is cheaper, but in my experience Lowe’s almost always charges less for the same item. Maybe that’s just in Canada? I do, however, appreciate that the HD website will tell me exactly what aisle and bin an item is in. At Lowe’s I’ll walk through the store several times sometimes before I find an item if I’m not sure what department it should be in."
5157,"I prefer Home Depot but I almost exclusively shop at Lowe's. Signing up for their veteran discount was painless and fast. Home Depots near me make getting a veteran discount a huge pain in the ass. So, fuck them."
5158,"In my experience, Lowes is better for finish stuff (cabinet hardware, blinds, curtain rods, etc) while Home Depot is better at just about everything else (rough in materials, plumbing supplies, electric, tools)."
5159,This has been my exact experience as well. I have one of each almost identically spaced and this is how I decide which to go to.
5160,"yes, I agree!"
5161,"I find Lowe’s (at least near me) has better finish items, while HD has more rough-in stuff. 

It’s also about the staff. At Lowe’s where I used to live, getting competent help was hard, at HD I was beating them off with a stick. 

Now that I’ve moved; The closest Lowe’s is 45 min away. Closest HD is 20."
5162,"Did they like that, when you beat them off, with a stick?"
5163,"Sounds rather painful.  I'd pass.

&#x200B;"
5164,This comment has me dieing.
5165,"To me the two stores are 100% identical and, I don't know if they do this anywhere else, here they literally build some stores *right* next to each other. Sometimes my decision boils down to things like whether I can turn left across traffic easier into one or another."
5166,"True about the return policy, except for that one time I had to return a door knob to HD. They said they didn’t have that door knob in their inventory. I argued that was ridiculous since I had just purchased it there a couple days before. Eventually they asked how much I paid for it and refunded me that amount. In the way home, it hit me. I bought that door knob at Lowe’s. HD doesn’t even carry that brand. I still feel like an asshole even though it was like 14 years ago."
5167,"One day I was intensely ADHDing and walked out with a bunch of products I was carrying. 

Usually it's only as bad as me walking up to the wrong car and actually pulling on the handle."
5168,"In the valley I live in, we have about 3 lowes and 3 home depos 

Only a home depot has an extensive rental center."
5169,Me too. I've never really seen any difference in them other than the color and location. I go to the one that's closest.
5170,"Yea, they are pretty interchangeable... my wife likes Lowe’s finished products better (like light fixtures, mirrors, faucets ect.). 

Both kinda expensive, both kinda poor quality."
5171,"It’s funny, I agree with finish hardware being better at Lowe’s for everything BUT light fixtures.  For some reason the ones at HD seem better to me."
5172,"For whatever reason, I’m able to find the things I want/need at HD better than Lowes. And I disagree on the return policy in regards to HD. My husband returns things long after the return date and often without receipt generally without fuss. We just end up with store credit that we’ll probably spend on our way out the door.

Lowes also don’t seem to always be located nearby. The HD is 10 minutes down the road from my house. The closest Lowes is currently 30+ minutes in either direction. It’s just not very convenient."
5173,"HD website and search is better.  Sometimes I search for things I need online and note the aisle/bin numbers.  Lowe's search just doesn't seem to pick up things as well, like searching for a specific trowel size.

And my Lowe's doesn't have tool rentals."
5174,"I sent Lowe's an email a couple years back showing how their search feature is inferior and how HD (at the time, not now) showed aisle locations and they did not.  They replied telling me that their market research showed that people tended to be happier when they wandered around and browsed.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it went 100% contrary to what I wanted so I stopped going to Lowe's (and for a few other reasons)."
5175,"Honestly, except for tools for most things, I'd rather go to Menard's."
5176,"> Menard's

Eh, 400 miles is a little far to transport drywall.

-Northeast resident."
5177,Trade-off is that you can probably get better hardwood lumber from local sawmills easier than we can.
5178,Now that you mention it we do have quite a few lumber yards within a 10 mile radius of our house....
5179,"Yeah, I had to travel 6 hours round-trip to pick up some cherry that wasn't worth as much as a home mortgage like our local suppliers."
5180,And Menard's can be a one stop shop. Need a t-shirt and some green beans with that caulk? Look no further!
5182,I avoid their off brand tools and take everything else with a grain of salt.
5183,I'm pretty sure a lot of their house brand stuff comes off the exact same assembly lines as Harbor Freight.
5185,"Yeah, but when it's $5 to $10 more than HF, it's a bit of a rip off."
5186,Makita makes their Masterforce tools.
5188,Home Depot has been just as political
5189,"I frequent both. 

* I have the credit cards for both. Lowes give you a blanket 5% off with the credit card. That's pretty good. So if there's similar goods for the same price, I'll go do Lowes. A lot of what I buy are essentially commodity goods (lumber, drywall, concrete) so I don't care where I buy it--just what price I pay.
* Home Depot does 1 year no-questions-asked returns on most everything with the credit card. And your ""if you  don't have a receipt you can forget it"" is inaccurate. They can look up a purchase with the card--even if it's not their card. Personally I've only ever had issues with Lowes customer service--never with Home Depot.
* Home Depot, IMO, tends to have higher quality goods for the comparable price tier. Not always, but often I've noticed this. This would be for things like blinds and toilets and decorative stuff. Not the same brand/model obviously. But the comparable item I feel I can generally count on to be higher quality at Home Depot--even if it is often a little more expensive.
* This will be highly local, but my Home Depot has *way* better staff.

>It always seems that HD is beating Lowes in revenue 

Home Depot has done much better with the pro crowd. As you can expect, it doesn't take too many local pros to overwhelm the sales volume of a thousand regular homeowners like you and me."
5190,"Return policy: ONLY if you have the card.  I've been screwed in the past by something I bought from them that I know for a fact Lowe's would have taken back.  It was beyond the 30 day period, but, as I said, Lowe's beats them hands down.  I appreciate your feedback and comment, thanks!"
5191,"HD will take back anything within a year of purchase with a receipt? I purchased a tool as a gift back in May and the person already had the tool. I lost the receipt and they declined the return (their computer printed a little reciept and they couldn't do anything about it). So I've been stuck with this tool I have no use for. However, I logged onto my account online and the purchase was done by credit card and it's recorded there. So will they take it back now that it's been 7 months? I haven't used it, it's new in the package still."
5192,"Lowe's appliance delivery is shameful and their lumber is mediocre.  
  
However, Lowe's employees generally leave me the fuck alone, which I prefer. They also picked up the hot dog cart guy's contract when HD canceled it a few years ago."
5193,"Two things:

1 - Lowes, at least in my area, tends to be more consumer oriented. It's for people doing home repairs or wanting to semi-DIY things. They have tons of fixtures, pre-cut lumber in several different varieties, lots of cabinet hardware and door hardware, etc.. HomeDepot is geared towards professional contractors. The stores here tend to have less variety of things like pre-cut boards and lumber, trim, and hardware and more large volume items, cases of fasteners, etc. 

2 - My customer service experiences with Lowes have been horrific. I ordered some very expensive kitchen appliances from them two years ago and they screwed it up SO badly that it took me 2 months to get my appliances and 5 months to have a working stove - and that's only because I gave up on them and hired a private plumber to come in and fix the issues that they caused and wouldn't take responsibility for.  I still buy little stuff at Lowes because they have it in stock as compared to HD, but I will never ever ever ever again use them for a large purchase or an installation. It's their loss, really, cause I bought my house 2 years ago and I have a long list of expensive projects that they're going to miss out on. Oh well."
5194,"Whenever I've needed Hardware such a screws or light switches or wall plates or caulk, there is always a larger selection at Home Depot, so I just don't bother going to Lowe's for that kind of stuff. Now things like light fixtures, I might try Lowe's first."
5195,"For me it's a brand thing. HD has Freud, Leviton, Simpson Strong-Tie...just to name a few. These are brands I depend on as a remodeler."
5196,"Story time... Once bought a kitchen light fixture from Lowes. Got it mostly installed only to find out the plastic cover they'd included in the box was the wrong part to fit the end brackets. Took all the parts I had left that weren't screwed to the ceiling, and the box and receipt, up to the store and asked them if they could swap that part for the right one.

And the answer was no. They said I had to go home, take down the whole fixture, fit it back into the box, and exchange it.

After raising enough of a commotion I finally got one of the CS reps to agree to let me go swap the parts from another box, but that advice ""wasn't on behalf of Lowes"" (he actually took off his apron to make the point) and they'd disavow any knowledge of it if anybody asked.

In contrast, Home Depot has previously just let me return the one incorrect piece for the whole refund if I'd wanted to (I actually had to argue that I just wanted an exchange, thanks).

You'd think I'd eventually learn to make sure all the pieces are present before I start, but no, that would be too easy..."
5197,"The solution is to buy a second one, swap the part, and return it."
5198,"If you are a DIY'r, you don't ask for actual advice from either."
5199,"In my experience, Home Depot has better selection and better prices, Lowes has better customer service.

Sort like the difference in Walmart and Target.

I prefer Lowes, but there is not a HUGE difference between the two."
5200,"I try to go to Home Depot over Lowe's simply because they're headquartered here in Atlanta but I've always lived closer to a Lowe's and whenever I couldn't find something at Home Depot, Lowe's has always had it. So I go to Lowe's more..."
5201,I return stuff to hd without receipts maybe once a week! Generally lowes is more expensive than home depot too.
5202,"I’m the exact opposite, I prefer Lowe’s over Home Depot. 

It’s closer to my house and the customer service I have received at Lowe’s has always been great."
5203,"I’ve never had good experiences with Home Depot. I’ve gone there for specific things like turned railing posts and they simply didn’t stock any where Lowe’s had several choices. 

Home Depot is also the only place where I had a store employee yell at me (a contractor) for saying “excuse me” after waiting through a good minute of his personal conversation with another employee. I just needed to use his pen to rough up some dimensions."
5204,"I find Lowes to be cleaner, brighter, less crowded, and more employees to get help with stuff vs Home Depot which is dark, dingy, dusty, crowded, and every employee is busy so it's hard to get help. Home Depot does have cheaper prices and a way better tool selection, but Lowes seems to have nicer items. Both are within a 3-5 minute drive for me so I pretty much choose what I want from both. I prefer Lowes, but when I need a tool now then it's off to Home Depot. I've used the HD rental tool a couple times as well. Also, I've been harassed by those stupid solicitors at Home Depot (no I don't need my water tested, been drinking the same unfiltered twp water for over three decades).

Overall it's Lowes for me, but HD wins in tools."
5205,Revenue has much less to do with you the mere homeowner vs the contractor. Home Depot’s pro dept is fast and easy. Those are the guys dropping 2500 a week not a year.
5206,"In my area, HD has better locations.  There are fewer lowes around.  I prefer lowes though.  They are nicer, cleaner, and there is an unlimited amount of 10% and $20 off coupons.  I save a ton of money using them."
5207,Purdy. But now the shoe is on the other foot
5208,"I like Home Depot for LED lights, I like Lowes for lumber.  Otherwise, either one is fine with me."
5209,"Yep, the GE LEDs at Lowes are very low quality.  I’d much rather have my selection of Cree, Philips and even EcoSmart (made by Lighting Science, a reputable company) at HD."
5210,"Home Depot can and will offer returns/exchanges based on the credit card.  That's a nationwide policy.  If you have no receipt and you paid with cash, well.. maybe you just weren't mean to return it.  Especially after years.  I can guarantee you there is no corporate policy that says you can return items after ""years"" with no receipt.  You just got lucky with the one you live near.

All the Home Depots I've ever lived near have sold wood and trim by the foot and allowed you to cut it yourself.  Lowe's sells it by the piece.  Everything else is just about identical.  I make a lot of trips buying wood or trim so I don't even bother going by Lowe's any more."
5211,"Home Depot- I created a HD account, tied my debit card to the account, and all my past purchases were there. Easy solution if you don't have a receipt. In fact it really saved me because I forgot to get receipts for my insurance.

But in terms of revenue: marketing. I see HD adds all the time."
5212,"Home Depot has a decent online site. I don't order much from it but it's a good way to check stock and it even tells you what aisle your thing is per store location. I really appreciate that. 

Lowe's is close to home while home depot is close to work so depending on where I am, that's the one I'll go to usually."
5213,"We don't have HD here but Menards and a Lowes.  I consider HD and Menards o be pretty similar.   Certain items I buy from Menards and other stuff from Lowes.  Menards wood sucks except for some of the trim.  Lowes is overpriced on electrical and plumbing stuff.  Otherwise, its what is on sale"
5214,Have you ever had an appliance delivered from Lowes?  That will ruin you every time!
5215,Yes several.  No probs
5216,"I'm with you, I much prefer my Lowe't to my local HD. Where I use to live I preferred HD.  Where I live now, the staff at Lowe's is way more helpful and competent (for the most part) paint department is way faster. Prices are better. Selection isn't (its an older smaller Lowe's) but then I just order online and have it shipped to store. In the 3 years I have been in my current house I have only had to go to HD maybe 5 times and it always annoys me."
5218,Some people just hate being happy.
5219,I actually prefer Lowe's because home depot only sells coke products.
5220,"Because they taste vastly different.

Any other questions?"
5221,"In my case, it is because the search on home depots website, while still terrible, is less terrible than the search on lowes. Lowes search, even if I know the model number or partial name, will frequently give me zero results. In addition, the tool section at my local lowes is lettered (A,B,C etc.) whereas the website lists aisle number and bay numbers... As a result, anytime I try to buy tools/tool accessories I have to ask an employee for help to find it. As the bay numbers and letters do not match in any way shape or form."
5222,I find the exact opposite to be true with Lowes. I have had a lot of difficulty returning items there even with a receipt. HD on the other hand will often take returns or at least replace items with no receipt.
5223,"Edit: i will keep adding occsionally for the next day or so, just post your comment below. i WILL NOT add sites like eBay and Etsy... those are not ""unknown"" or uncommon websites at all...

American-made, custom, RTA (ready to assemble) cabinets. 3/4"" plywood frame, 5/8""  dovetail drawers with Blumotion slides. You pay a bit more than the Home Depot MDF frame cabinets, but unless you have truly exotic tastes, they can custom-build to anything you want and they can handle getting wet without falling apart."

5229,Hi I posted it up as well
5231,Thank you kindly!
5232,How much is “a bit more”?
5233,"Figure on 50-100% more than Home Depot pre-assembled cabinets for a basic wood, Shaker door style. In exchange, it's built like a tank and completely custom.

The cheaper alternative is IKEA cabinets. For what you pay, usually comparable to big box store cabinets, you get a very good RTA.

**Edit:** Barker Cabinets doesn't do the usual ""let us send you a quote, and give us your phone number and email address so we can keep spamming you"" thing. Want to know exact prices? Build the cabinets you want on their website. You get to see how much different options cost in the drop-down menus as you pick them."
5234,"I just placed an order with Barker a few weeks ago. I’m so pumped to get my cabinets! After watching some of their YouTube videos and getting a sample, I can’t imagine ordering particle board cabinets!"
5235,"Same here. We are just getting new doors for our cabinets from them (probably ordering them next year) and I have yet to find a cheaper, better cabinet/cabinet door company to order from."
5236,"And you can get cheap samples sent to you before you make a big, essentially blind, purchase from them too!"
5237,Thanks!  I didn't know these sites existed or how to link things. Appreciate the information!

In case anyone didn't get the links"
5277,Not all heroes wear capes.
5278,Thanks you!
5279,Select blinds have the cheapest custom blinds I’ve seen. And they always have sales!
5280,"Believe it or not, Home Depot actually had the cheapest blinds when I bought them in July during a 30% off sale."
5281,Lowe’s has 40% off sometimes. And they both price match each other.
5282,"We did our first home with blinds from Home Depot 13 years ago, they are still hanging in the same house."
5283,"Home Depot 3 years ago, custom sized 2"" faux wood blinds that are cordless.  They were stupid cheap.  Like 10 windows were less than $500."
5284,"I love blinds.com. Similar concept, I think. They're always running a sale, and if you can afford to wait, you can get insanely good deals. Their customer service was top-notch when they sent me a mismanufactured blind, too"
5285,There warranty replacement was super easy.  So easy that I didnt care I had 2 break (over 3 years).
5286,"Blindsgalore.com also has really good deals, especially during the holidays. This site is my favorite because they have custom sizing, where a lot of sites like Lowe's or others often only have select sizes. Although I've never tried Select Blinds, so maybe it's worth looking into!"
5287,"Society6 is my go-to for artwork. The prices are relatively reasonable, and there are a lot of unique prints available."
5288,"A lot of independent artists use that site so you tend to get some more unique options as opposed to mass produced works.

Also you get stickers with your purchase... ultimate win."
5289,"They also have fantastic customer service. I bought a douvet cover off of society6 last year, it ended up not being what I needed and I reached out to them about returning it. They refunded 100% of my money and told me to keep or donate it"
5290,Boltdepot for specialized bolts.
5291,Seconded. I've bought a bunch of machine screws from them and have been very happy with my purchases.
5292,"I recommend [Everything But the House](www.ebth.com) if you live in the USA — basically a massive ongoing estate-sale / auction with interesting antiques and some bargains. I found a gorgeous 9x12 foot Persian carpet for $125, cost a bit more then that to ship it from Boston to NYC. Similar rugs might sell for $5000 and up at ABC Carpet & Home"
5293,I both love and hate you for this.  I love antiques unique items - and I’m a sucker for a wool area rug.
5294,"similar site shopgoodwill.com

its basically just stuff that gets donated to goodwill that is actually worth something (usually)"
5295,"""Cool knobs and pulls"" was a website I found years ago when I was broke and bought my first home. I had shitty, gross, dated copper pulls on my cabinets with an odd spacing. I found some nice nickel ones in that weird spacing for cheaper than the same style at Home Depot that would have required drilling new holes."
5296,"[House of Antiques Hardware](https://www.houseofantiquehardware.com/?GCID=S14464x015&KEYWORD=house%20of%20antiques%20hardware&partner=gpc&gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oei1RODKjPmtbEhwlXSgLoWVJEcvy1hIe76TgoE3DDzSY_rhSwgSokYaAnc9EALw_wcB) I like for unique hardware like push button light switches and plates. 

[Signature Hardware](https://www.signaturehardware.com) I have purchased our floor register coverings from them, they have a lot of sizes and styles not found in big box stores! I love the cast iron registers, personally.

[CB2](https://www.cb2.com), also has a nice selection of hardware among their offerings of furniture and linens. I recently purchased some great towel hooks from them.

[H&M home](https://m2.hm.com/m/en_us/home.html) has the best accent pillow covers! Great quality and affordable."
5297,Second CB2! I’ve gotten many decor items and some great barstools from them. I didn’t know it existed before I bought this house and it’s my favorite store now. It’s the more modern brand owned by Crate and Barrel. Sort of what West Elm is to Pottery Barn.
5298,"[Wm. A. Kilian Hardware Co.](http://kilianhardware.com/)

I have an 1886 Victorian house with original double-hung weight and chain (instead of rope) windows and this place has all the tools and hardware that I've needed to restore them to their original glory."
5299,"Second this- plus its in my neighborhood, great people"
5300,"mcmaster.com for every specialized part, bolt, beam, motor, fitting, flange, etc you can think of. They have literally every kind of fastener and fitting and gasket you can think of, searchable by material, size, threads, etc."
5301,"To add to this, also check MSC Direct. You can find the part number on McMaster, then copy it to search on MSC and sometimes find the same item for cheaper. MSC also has a huge catalog. Both have really fast shipping. (Related note: McMaster's shipping is magical - I've ordered something at 5pm and it was in my hands by 11am the next day. They have a lot of different distribution centers to get you stuff quickly.)"
5302,"Good point, I have bought fasteners professionally in the past as part of my work. McMaster is great for finding rare or unique items and their product drawings are awesome. However you pay much higher unit prices."
5303,Wow I used them years ago to get a unique spacer for a custom motorcycle I was building
5304,"You can get so lost on that site.  Came for an o ring, 3 hours later..."
5305,Definitely a good one!
5306,Mcmaster bones you on shipping though.
5307,little known?
5308,"Fair, but while they are huge for mechanical professionals I don't think they are as well known by homeowners. I thought of it because just yesterday I told my father about it and he'd never heard of them despite being a big DIY house guy."
5309,I like [Super Bright LEDs](https://www.superbrightleds.com).
5310,"[The Shutter Store](https://www.theshutterstore.com/). We got plantation shutters from there. If you're even a barely capable handyman, you can measure for them, send out the order, wait a month or so, then install them yourself for 1/10th the cost of even just ordering from somewhere like Lowes ... and you can get real wood instead of plastic for that price."
5311,"Outwater.com has some amazing and really weird building materials.  They’re have both residential and commercial.  Their website is hard to navigate but they have stuff you didn’t even know existed.  They have a lot of plastics, laminates, moldings, fittings, cabinet hardware, architectural pieces etc."
5312,Buying kitchen items from restaurant supply stores. They are MUCH better quality and insanely cheap!!!
5313,"Been using [BlindsChalet](https://www.blindschalet.com/) for years and always had a good experience.

NEVER buy full price.  If you don't get at least 35-40% off just wait with the items in your cart."
5314,"Lighting and hardware:

[Rejuvenation](https://www.rejuvenation.com/catalog/categories/hardware)

[Schoolhouse Electric](https://www.schoolhouse.com/)

[Lumens](https://www.lumens.com/)"
5315,"Rejuvenation is an excellent source if your lighting needs are specific to an architecture style.  Art-deco, Mission, Tudor, mid-century modern, etc. and all finishes are custom.  They are not inexpensive though.

About 15 years ago they had a custom order of about 70 Tudor-style wall sconces ready to ship for a client who cancelled.  I guess they looked at my purchase history as the sconces coordinated with three other lights I bought from them.  I picked up a few for less than half the cost, and these lights were next on my list to buy!"
5316,"Repairclinic.com[repairclinic.com](http://www.repairclinic.com)
Parts for everything in your home and garage.  I've used this site to fix my dishwasher, dryer, washing machine, tiller, and mower.  Just search by model # and it will usually give full parts list and diagram."
5317,Aaaaand saved
5318,"[woodworker express](http://woodworkerexpress.com/) is great for cabinet parts, inserts, pulls, hinges etc at the best prices I've seen. Blum complex mechanisms all over the place. The very cheapest place I've found for rev a shelf components. 

If you find better prices elsewhere please advise."
5319,"Mrdirect has awesome sinks, for 1/4 the price. They make an extra deep strainer too."
5320,"> Mrdirect.com

5321,Need this right now. Thanks!
5322,Need to buy one right now also!! Thanks!!

5324,"I don’t know how well known it is, but we got our sofa from Joybird and it’s the most comfortable couch ever. We got the Lewis sectional. It’s legitimately like a bed."
5325,"(www.grandbrass.com)

Cheapest place found for lightening wire and hardware. Their support is fantastic if you have any questions or need help finding a part.


Cb2 and build count as little known....?"
5380,Build.com
5327,Residential architect here. We use this site often in my office when selecting finishes. Site is super easy to navigate. Saves alot of time.

5329,https://www.tablelegsonline.com/
5330,https://www.homereserve.com/
5331,Rememberthefilter.com for any non standard sized furnace filters at reasonable prices.
5332,"I’m still a newb and only used HD. I wanted acoustic insulation and ended up finding it on Craigslist. I do a lot of thrifting. Buy nothing group on Facebook has provided us with appliances, wall sconces, ceiling fans, and I didn’t pay a dime.

These are all popular websites, so I apologize for not fitting into the criteria. However they have been very effective for me"
5334,"Yeah I found a pack of 4” roxul on Craigslist, HD doesn’t stock it or Owens in my area"
5335,"This place is a bit pricey and it takes a bit for orders to arrive but their stuff is very cool:

[Schoolhouse Electric](https://www.schoolhouse.com/)"
5336,[(https://www.softenerparts.com/)]
5337,"That site totally saved me when I was trying to fix the water softener that came with my house. It was a brand that didn't exist anymore but had a different name. They had a guide to fix exactly what my problem was, with a video on how to do it."
5338,Same here! Saved me tons of money.
5339,"So, my favorite by far is [Funky Sofa](http://www.funkysofa.com). Some of the sofas are a bit pricey, But they have the coolest looking sofas/couches and they are all custom. They have tons of fabrics and color choices at the base price and the premium fabrics are usually not very much more."
5340,"Lamps plus, farm and fleet, EBay."
5341,"Structure.com , designpublic.com , beambk.com (Beam has all the stuff you'd see in actual stores in Scandinavian countries, it's great)"
5342,"Anybody know where I might find 29""x8"" stair treads with a  matching 21""x30"" oval for the landing? I have a set that came with my home but I am unable to to find replacements and the ones I have are getting pretty ratty.

5345,This looks like a winner Thank You 😊
5346,"Honestly, etsy might work"
5347,"[The Builder Depot](https://thebuilderdepot.com) for great stone tile deals

[Apt 2B](https://apt2b.com) has some nice furniture"
5348,"[us-mattress.com](https://www.us-mattress.com) has very competitive up-front prices online. You can basically find the same model as in any department store or mattress firm for less (mattress brands try to rename them to be scammy, so you have to do your research first). They have stores locally here so it's not a fly-by-night operation."
5349,"[SWISCO](https://www.swisco.com/cl/Catalog)  - closet door, window, and other hardware. Includes a part identification service."
5350,Damn...this might be the most valuable thread I've seen in months.
5351,([Esalerugs.com])
5352,Blindparts.com they have every part and detailed pictures of each item they carry.
5353,"[Light N Leisure](https://www.lightnleisure.com) has the best prices I’ve seen on higher quality light fixtures and almost always runs discounts without brand exclusions.  Plus, since it’s a small company with only 3 physical stores, they are able to provide great customer service."
5354,"www.discountfurnacefilter.com

It's exactly what you'd expect. Always been fast and cheaper than Amazon for those with specialty furnace filter needs."
5355,Americanframe.com for custom framing
5356,"www.websaurantstore.com it's a supply store for restaurants, but I've found some good stuff on there."
5357,It's great for wire shelving units and accessories. We got the Container Store brand for shelves but the rest from this site.
5358,"[Lehman's](https://www.lehmans.com/) for old-school, working farmhouse stuff. [Townsend's](https://www.townsends.us/) is for American Colonial reenactment, but I wish I could build a small house and fill it with everything they sell."
5359,"Suggestion: add a 1-2 word description for those sites without descriptive names.

This is a great idea and resource! Thanks!"
5360,"Lee Valley Tools.  

In addition to hand tools, they also have garden and kitchen stuff I've not seen anywhere else.  But the real shine is the hardware selection.  You want fancy drawer pulls, knobs, etc?  Check them out.

Chilewich - for placemats but also for custom-sized flooring that works great in an office (your chair wheels roll right over the flooring). 

Brooklinen and Snowe for bedding/towels. Can vouch for Snowe: very nice bedding for what you pay for. The Company Store is good as well. Snowe also has starter kits for dishes and glassware but haven't tried them out. They look nice though.

Casper and similar for mattresses. 

Online design services like Havenly (there's others, can't remember their names; have had good experience with Havenly). 

JC Penny for window treatments -- they will help you select, measure, install and all of that. (But Home Depot is best for cellular shades, though I know you said you aren't including them). 

AJ Madison for appliance reviews, specs, pricing. We ended up purchasing local for the service agreements, but this was a great resource for research.

I have a love-hate relationship with West Elm. If you like MCM and are looking for apartment-sized furniture, they can be a pretty good choice, but I'd want to test the furniture out in person. 

cableorganizer.com - lots of good advice and products. 

urbanoutfitters and anthropologie have some interesting decor. (got some throw pillows from urban outfitters)."
5387,"[Flying Bulldogs](https://www.flyingbulldogs.com/) sells discounted bathroom & kitchen hardware, light fixtures, and designer quilting & home-decor fabric! They're a small family owned & operated business."
5388,"Loving these suggestions! I have recently learned of a Habitat ReStore. It’s like a goodwill for stuff that I typically find absurdly expensive and overpriced, and don’t care if it’s new or not: doors, ceiling fans, tools, lumber, etc. We just had a baby and it was a relief to find out about this place, so we could continue with some unexpected improvements, without spending a fortune. 

So, since I’ll be using these links, adding my two cents on this brick and mortar gem (depending on where you live). Habitat for Humanity ReStore."

5395,"I would add [Lexar Cabinets](https://lexarcabinets.com/) to the list. They are mainly for Southern California, but make cabinets that can be customized easily through their website. All the cabinets come fully assembled."

5413,"If you have Menards in your area, that is the best in my opinion.  Otherwise I go to both interchangeably, but most often to Home Depot because it is closer."
5414,"I used to go to Menards for everything but I feel like in the last 5 to 6 years, the quality of some of their products (kitchen and bath, tools and flooring to name a few) has trended towards the cheaper end. I worked there for four years when I was in high school and college, so I tried to stay loyal but I've made the jump to Home Depot for most of my home improvement needs. I only go to Menards in a pinch because it's closer.

As for HD or Lowes, they seem pretty similar from my experience."
5415,"I prefer Home Depot. I have both near me, and *my experience* at the two locations *I go to* (not general opinions of the chains, or saying they're all the same) I find the quality of the products at HD to be superior and the employees to be more friendly and knowledgeable on average. That said, I'll still go to Lowes sometimes. They're both fine stores."
5416,Use them both.  Compare prices and items and use the best one.
5417,depends. Lowes has higher quality lumber or perhaps fewer folks picking through it. HD has lower prices and more knowledgeable [if less attractive] folks working there
5418,"I've found that Lowes has more aesthetic stuff, whereas Home Depot usually has more utilitarian stuff. I'd check out Lowes for a door, HD for a drill. This is just my experience."
5419,"Honestly, I've had crappy experiences with both of them, but they are necessary evils.  This is a little like having an argument over what is a better color, red or blue? 

I work in different areas and its actually quite surprising how different their stock is depending on location.  In more rural areas they will have a lot more tractor lawn mowers, propane etc.  While urban areas might have more fencing options, patio furniture etc.  Some of the stores vary a lot in sq footage so the amount of merchandise may vary greatly."
5420,"Home Depot is better for most things.  Better deals on tools, cheaper delivery options, better framing lumber.  I grew up on HD and I'm often surprised by the lack of stuff lowe's has."
5421,The lowes around here is quite massive and has more tools including house items but I do agree HD has more knowledgeable and helpfull staff.
5422,"I've found Lowes has a better outdoor plant/garden selection. You also can't find anyone to help.  If you need a specific valve, fitting, screw, forget it.  Everything has been rummaged through and no longer in the appropriate box/area.  Also, they don't have self check-out and there is always someone in line at the one check-out aisle that is open that will try to return or argue about a coupon.

I mostly go to HD."
5424,"Lowes, but I'm in Canada. They have people in the store who actually help you rather than running away.

Mind you, their nuts and bolts section sucks."
5425,"Home Depot - because that's what my family went to, and until recently, there wasn't a Lowe's anywhere near me."
5426,"It 100% depends on the management.  I used to always shop at Lowes, friendly staff, good organization.  They they opened a Home Depot close by.  Friendlier staff, better organization, better all-round.  Now I've moved to a new location the nearby Lowes is the better store...."
5427,"Home Depot is my go to.  Their plumbing and electrical section (for me) has a better selection.  In general they end up a little cheaper.

For fixtures (lights, hardware, sinks) I shop at both."
5428,It depends. I like both but for different things.
5429,Lowe’s is my preference because I find the customer service better opposed to Home Depot not sure if that’s consistent because I really only go to the one nearest my house.  Prices are pretty similar but each run decent deals throughout the year.  I did my carpet upstairs through Home Depot because of the free install.
5430,"There’s no right answer here. They will both have certain things the other doesn’t, and both will have better prices on certain items. You’ll just have to go back and forth a little. I never have settled on one. For me, HD has better painting supplies (not actual paint!!! Don’t buy paint at hardware store). HD has better lighting options. Lowe’s typically has better lawn equipment and prices on outdoor equipment. As far as customer service goes, it’s a crapshoot depending on store locations. Overall Lowe’s is usually better customer service in my experience. But it really just depends on location."
5431,"I prefer Home Depot. I fucking love the electronic receipts they do, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable enough. I find Lowe’s is a bit higher priced."
5432,"Lowe's mostly, because I get 10% off there."
5434,"Aye same, thanks for the service"
5435,HD does it too...
5436,How do you get 10% off?
5437,"At Home Depot, you ask. Some ask for proof. Some don’t. Lowe’s makes you sign up online and then it’s just a phone number."
5438,"Not everyday, not where I am"
5439,Very odd. I have never been in a Home Depot that did not offer it at all times.
5440,*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** nicholas_janik! ^(hug)
5441,"Only on certain items, and definitely not on lumber."
5442,"All about the customer service of the specific stores close to you. 

As a general theme I prefer Home Depot for more convenience with online stock tools/receipts and better tool selection. Lowes seems to do better on appliances though."
5443,"My experience is that has come down more to the individual store regardless of which chain. Gotten really good service and advice from both but also received really bad service and advice from both. Same goes for Menards. You can definitely use the stores against each other to take advantage of price matching.

The negatives of the big box stores is that the quality of the products aren't going to be quite as good as a specialty store. For example, sprinkler and irrigation parts might be sold by the same brands (Toro, Hunter, Rainbird,etc) as the parts at a SiteOne or online via Sprinklerwarehouse.com, but the models are usually one or two versions behind the most recent.  

And for gardening/lawn Care, buying bulk mulch/topsoil/rock is usually about half the cost if you find a landscape supplier or garden nursery. We have had good luck with annuals and a few perennial plants from Lowe's. However, I'd recommend to never buy grass seed from a big box retailer."
5444,That's been my experience as well.
5445,At Home Depot you can find straight lumber.
5446,"Of course there's a difference. They're entirely different stores. And HD caters more towards contractors, while Lowe's caters towards homeowners. (Lowe's is dropping that and going after the contractor market in the future though)"
5447,"I think it really depends on where you live and what sort of project you are doing. Where I used to live, the Lowes was great and the Home Depot was a disaster. Where I live now, it's the opposite. 

Though to be honest, I prefer my local True Value, primarily because it is closer to my house and has 99% of the things I need. I find I tend to get better and more knowledgeable service at those places, too. Little pricier, but they are locally owned and operated, so I'd rather spend my money there."
5448,"I'll start off by saying that any of these factors can change based on where you are. This is just specifically for my city. In my experiences, Lowes is more geared toward the DIY homeowner while home depot is better suited for the professional. Lowes tends to offer better assistance for customers on what to get and how to do things, and they tend to be better in regards to organization and labeling. Price wise I find that they are pretty competitive with each other. One area where I find home depot tends to excell is in lumber. There lumber is almost always better quality than Lowes, being straighter and with less broken pieces on display. Home depot also often stocks a cart filled with reject pieces of wood that they will sell for 70% off, and if you only need a small peice of wood for part of a project you can often find a peice in this reject pile which can be cut down to be good enough for what you plan to use it for. So basically I go to home depot for my lumber, I go to Lowes for almost everything else, and I go wherever has the best online quoted price on very expensive purchases like appliances.

TLDR: it may vary by area, but where I am I find that it's best to go to home depot for lumber and Lowes for almost everything else."
