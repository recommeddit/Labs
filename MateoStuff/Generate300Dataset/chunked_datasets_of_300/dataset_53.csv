16966,An old iOS favorite of mine is 868-HACK. Really weird game that is basically a single screen rogue like that doesn't provide instructions. Part of the game is figuring out how to play the game. It's a great iPhone game.
16967,"Shout outs to everything by Michael Brough: Imbroglio, Cinco Paus (tho you need a guide if you don’t know Portuguese), P1 Select. Imbroglio is my favorite."
16968,"Wow just looked this up, looks amazing"
16969,"That is a great list!

I have and enjoy many of those.

Can I nominate [Solitarica](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solitairica/id970202342) ? A great little rogue-lite RPG with solitaire mechanics.

A great game I wish would be available again is [Til Morning's Light](https://til-mornings-light.fandom.com/wiki/Til_Morning%27s_Light) from Amazon Game Studios. I still have it on my 1st gen iPad Air and it was so well done. I think the publisher chose not to update and keep selling it, so future gamers miss out :("
16970,"Excellent list, I've been tempted by Northgard and I think your post has pursuaded me to give it a go."
16971,"You’ll want to be playing on a plus sized phone at the least. And it’s currently a battery fiend.
Just a heads up."
16972,This is like the 3rd post either calling Northgard the best game on iOS or one of the best.  I’ve really enjoyed it so far.  Make sure to turn off the higher performance graphics.  My phone got really hot until I turned it off and honestly I don’t notice a big difference.
16973,I played northgard on PC when it first came out. Replayed a lot on iOS. Very very good game.
16974,"And Northgard is just mid-upper tier in terms of PC games. Some of the best PC games of all time are also on mobile (xcom, civ, kotor, rome:TW) but Northgard beats them because of the amount of effort than went into making sure it runs consistently and controls well. It'll be held up as an example of how to port a game to a touchscreen for years to come."
16975,Glad I could help! Good choice
16976,"Hey there, new to the sub. Just wanted to say thanks for the list. Hope to see more on here, for many genres"
16977,Happy to help
16978,Well this post just cost me $20.
16979,Whoops! What did you end up getting?
16980,https://i.imgur.com/Zub9yLw.jpg
16981,Ha! I loved sorcery you’ll have a blast.
16982,Looking forward to all these news games. Thanks forth the list!
16983,"Btw, the first Sorcery game is a little short, Sorcery 2 is really where the series hits its stride. The city of Khare is one of my favorite fantasy locations because of it and you can really explore every nook and cranny of it in 2"
16984,No Polytopia??
16985,"I’ll be honest, I know people love it but I really didn’t have fun with it so I didn’t wanna recommend it lmao ;)"
16986,Have you tried “A Dark Room”? One of the most unique games I have ever played.
16987,That ones great! A slow burn but man if you give it time it really blossoms
16988,Yeah I always throw that recommendation out there.  Thanks for this list! I am excited to try these out.
16989,"This is the best list I’ve seen. I’d recommend checking out:
- Trouble with robots
- Mindustry
- Kingdom two crowns
- battle chasers night war
- hearthstone"
16990,"Oooo these are cool, thanks"
16991,"Maybe not Hearthstone. Really not a well designed card game, as someone who’s played a ton."
16992,Also the monetization is atrocious.
16993,"I will admit, after brode left and they changed to a season pass I hate it, but it’s totally playable for free after a certain point. Back in the glory days I spent money on decks every month because I wanted to, but I haven’t payed a cent in the last 2 to 2.5 years due to lack of interest and lack of need. TLDR with patience you can play for free at a competitive level."
16994,"Yeah you can play for free to a certain level. But unless you want to enjoy new decks, play with the latest meta, and generally just have fun with the cards in a a card game, you’re going to have to pay a ton."
16995,"Mind if I ask for recommendations? Is one of my favourite genres! I’ve got to try magic arena soon. Didn’t like runes of tarrabah or whatever it was called. Loved slay the spire up until a point, mix of two great genres."
16996,"I would say Gwent is probably the best on mobile if LoR didn’t do it for you. Cards and Castles is also underrated. Teppen is okay, not very good monetisation but a super unique card game. But anything that isn’t HS; HS is literally the bottom of the barrel in every respective."
16997,Oh I loved Gwent and thronebreaker I should try it again. I didn’t get hooked on the mechanics as much as I have over the last 4-5 years of HS. Will have a look at the others
16998,"I’m glad you’ve enjoyed HS, because my experience with that game is just... ugh."
16999,"I adore Spiderweb Software games - as well as Avernum there's the Avadon series, and also Queen's Wish which is their first iPhone-compatible game as well.

Though I play them on Mac OS rather than iOS."
17000,"Sees best of games list
Doesn’t have Stardew Valley
Ignores list
/s

But seriously this is a solid list and well done. I just dove into Northgard and enjoying. Many others of good quality."
17001,"I find Stardew better suited to PC or Nintendo Switch personally, but great game all the same"
17002,"If their patch cycle for mobile and PC was exact then I’d find it better cause I liked moving my save between, but for one Dev and the quality, I have 0 complaints. Agree with you though, a bit better on PC."
17003,Card crawl is awesome!
17004,This is fantastic. Thanks for articulating your thoughts in such a well-edited post.
17005,"No problem, happy to help"
17006,I think Fiz: Brewery Management Game belongs on any top strategy list. Not sure if it still works tho
17007,"Anyone playing my favorite — UniWar?

My brothers and I have been playing this game for over 10 years. It’s one of the first iPhone games we got into and it’s been a solid ever since. New developers took it over a few years ago and have improved it in every way possible. 

The multiplayer aspect is fantastic. You can play against people all over the world. The competition over the last few years has gotten tougher which has made it more challenging and deep. Lots of tournaments to play, both individually and with teams. 

Can’t recommend this one too much. There are inexpensive ’in-app’ purchases available which improve game play but are not required. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uniwar-multiplayer-strategy/id311456818"
17008,Oh wow a fellow UniWar player!
17009,">[Starbase Orion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starbase-orion/id438375580) \- A remake of the classic Masters of Orion game. Fantastic, deep old-school space empire 4X. Highly recommended but be warned this game has a learning curve, but also a small yet dedicated online player base of veterans who are more than willing to help you learn.

This right here is a SUPER underappreciated gem. If you haven't played it and you're in the thread talking about Civ (or have any fond memories of Star Trek: Birth of the Federation) get this game."
17010,"I’ll contribute to this.  Been playing iOS games for almost a decade, been playing console games since the late 80’s.  This isn’t a full list of all the games I liked, that would just be way too long.  Instead, this is a list of the games that I enjoyed a little more than average.  All for iOS. All premium, no freemium.

17011,You should consider OXEN-Free
17013,I find playing anything that requires mechanical skill tough on an iPad without controller support. tablets are best suited to strategy games I think.
17014,"Starbase orion hasn’t been updated in a while, but it is updated to the latest iOS version, a good enough sign. I’ll check it out. Thanks for posting this list!"
17015,"This is a pretty impeccable list!  I have a few games I'd like to add to it.

&#x200B;

Rymdkapsle is an oldy but a goody.  You build a spaceship using sideways tetris blocks while little square men run around and defend it.  The music is very Eno-eque and lovely.  It was one of the first iOS games I bought and I've never not had it on my device.

&#x200B;

Retro Bowl is leaps and bounds beyond any other American football game on mobile.  It's tecmo bowl with an Angry Birds like mechanic for passing the ball.  It's a real gem and endlessly fun to play.

&#x200B;

GameDev Tycoon is my favorite of the dev/shop kinds of games.

&#x200B;

Polytopia is the leanest, meanest, cutest 4X game on mobile.  Civ Rev is a solid alternative to this as well.

&#x200B;

Human Resource Machine is an awesome ""learn to code"" game with great art style.

&#x200B;

Kingdom: New Lands might be my favorite mobile game of all time.  I've purchased it so many times I've lost count.  It's a really unique pixel art side scroller.  You are a king/queen with a horse who rides back and forth collecting coins and ordering buildings and defenses built.  At night the monsters come.  It has a sequel with added elements and co-op but I haven't spent as much time with that one."
17016,Worth it to buy ? :((
17017,Buy what?
17018,Northgard
17019,"If you like strategy games then definitely, I’d recommend having a large phone or preferably an iPad tho"
17020,This game
17022,It totally feels like a roguelike to me?
17023,Everyone calls dead cells a roguelike
17024,It’s definitely a rougelike in the modern sense of the word. Some argue all these games should be called rougelites as they aren’t turn based etc etc
17025,"Roguelite I can definitely see, not metroidvania though"
17027,Did you just... compliment your own post?
17028,"Whoops, I meant to reply to the guy above to recommend other stuff"
17029,Reddit mobiles interface...leaves a lot to be desired
17030,Haha. That makes a lot more sense
17031,"Northgard looks like a game that will become very copy/paste in a randomly generated world. The bit that I’ve read about it made me think that each clan has a very specific way to play and once you figure out their efficiencies, it’s very monotonous. Right or wrong?"
17032,"Mostly right, but this is the pattern with almost every RTS game. The genre is sorta built around this. So if that doesn’t appeal to you then that makes sense, but as far as a genre game goes Northgard is a good one."
17033,What about 2d platformers?
17034,Only Icewind Dale? What about the other ones like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur’s Gate? Any reasoning on why these didn’t make the cut? Never played any of these 3 and I’m curious.
17035,"I’m sure Baldurs Gate iOS and the others are wonderful and i love them all on PC, I’ve just only played Icewind on IOS so I went with just that"
17036,"Ah, I see, understandable"
17037,You MUST play Baldurs Gate 2
17038,The games are great but a PC with a mouse is the best way to experience them. I made it through Planescape Torment on IOS mostly because the battles are easy and the text is plentiful.
17039,The only iOS one I’ve played is Dead Cells. I mean it’s not a platformer per se but it has a lot of platforming.
17040,"so king of dragon pass or six ages, if you can only choose one?
(i’ve already got king of dragon pass, so seeing if i should sink in more $ if it’s more of the same)"
17041,"Six Ages is the same vein as KODP. The game is a little more streamlined and less obtuse. But other than that it’s more of the same. It’s an entirely different culture this time however, not the Orlanthi. The events, gods, etc are all unique and new too. If you liked KODP, you’ll like 6 ages"
17042,Six Ages just builds on everything that made KODP great.
17043,"I think it should be stated if a game is suitable for phones or just tablets only.

Anyone who’s tried to play Icewind Dale/Baldur’s gate on a phone knows how it simply doesn’t work well."
17044,"Out There is light?? My poor little brain!

Good list though; great to see Door Kickers getting some love."
17045,"I meant more in the pick and play aspect, you don’t need to commit to playing it"
17046,Finally Device 6! I don't think this game is mentioned enough in this sub. It's freakin awesome and holds up pretty well until now given it was released years ago.
17047,Dude if you’ve ever found anything that’s like Device 6 please lemme know I NEED IT
17048,"Dude, believe me. I've looked for a game like Device 6 many times but still nothing. Hope they make a sequel tho."
17049,Do y’all think it’ll be better to play Northgard on the switch?
17050,I own it on switch too. I like every version of it tbh. The switch version is a little awkward to control at first but once it clicks it’s very smooth.
17051,"There are certain games I just love playing on the touchscreen, like Civ 6. It is just so good in the iPad Pro. I wonder if that’s the case for Northgard too - I’m more tempted to get it on iOS"
17052,"I just could not get into King of Dragon pass. What am I doing wrong? 

I just could not get a feel for the consequences of actions or a sense of building anything so it all felt aimless to me."
17053,"I get that. I think it’s a matter of your mindset. You can’t really approach this game with a CIV or 4X mindset. The goal here is just slowly growing your tribe and creating your story. The short term goal should always be amassing cows and wealth, along with gaining renown. The long term goal of the game is gaining enough wealth and renown to eventually begin the process of becoming a king of a combined tribal kingdom. 

Also, a lot of this game is trial and error, you never know how the events shake out."
17054,I’m going to give it another go. Thanks.
17055,Great detailed list. Thank you very much!
17056,The Talos Principle is a game that has entertained me a lot.
17057,I love starbase Orion!
17058,"Retro Bowl may not be the GOTY, but it took over my phone for 2020, no competition."
17059,"So much fun. If you have any 8/16 bit sports game nostalgia, then this game is a must. If you like sports games at all, it is worth a try."
17060,Downloaded this on based on your comment a few days ago; by I and my phone’s battery hate you. I can’t stop playing!
17061,"I dont have a particular order but I also seem to enjoy relaxing idle like games too. My top list for this year seems to be: 

1. Metal Slug Infinity
2. Merchantrpg 
3. Immortal:Reborn
4. The battle cats
5. Cat game
6. Dungeon Maker 
7. Simplest RPG game
8. Minimal Dungeon
9. Melvor Idle 
10. Legends of Runeterra 

Idk when any of those games came out but that’s what I seemed to have played the most."
17062,I love seeing Melvor on any list.  I’m not huge into incremental games but damn MI is hella addictive.  Awesome that it’s free too with cloud save feature so you can swap between devices.  Interesting too the strats for tackling some of the later dungeons etc.  I can see myself playing it for a long time (already logged a few months into it and only just now diving into the dungeons / combat).
17063,Very addictive for sure! I’m still just getting into the combat as well as I wanted to get all the gathering and crafting skills leveled up first haha.
17065,"*Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords* deserves a look. Some madlads even released a mobile-compatible version of the famous Restored Content Mod.

Nice list otherwise!"
17066,"Thanks for the list! Real good games there

Do you prefer a3 or Raziel?"
17067,Both are my type of games. A3 is best for mmorpg genre. And Raziel for dungeon crawler action genre.
17068,"I don’t purchase games too often, but some free ones that really grabbed me this year:

-	Random Dice
-	Legends of Runeterra
-	Coffee Inc. 
-	Golf Blitz
-	Among Us

In order of addiction. Random Dice is probably my biggest surprise. I was so sure it would be straight garbage, ad-riddled nonsense, but it’s surprisingly fully opt-in if you want to watch ads for unlocks, it’s pretty decently balanced, you can unlock tons of dice without spending a cent, and while 5 co-op plays is sort of lame (and paywalling more of them is worse) you can do quite a lot of runs without any interference. 

The in game currency is absolutely outrageously priced though, Jesus."
17069,"same feelings about Random Dice. quite pleasantly surprised how into it ive gotten.

protip : prop means proportional. i embarrassingly, took far too long to realize this!"
17070,Kartrider+ is the same as [KartRider Rush+](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/kartrider-rush/id1466736988)?
17071,Yup. The same. Forgot to add the word 'Rush'.
17072,"That's weird, I can't seem to find Star Wars: Starfighter missions in the App store. I'm using an iPhone Xr in the United States."
17073,Oh thats sad. I tink its still not available in few countries.
17074,"I like your top 20, I found a really awesome list on iphonesoft with LoL Wild Rift, Hundred Soul, Space Marshal 3 or Totally Reliable Delivery.

See here:
https://iphonesoft.fr/2020/12/25/top-2020-meilleurs-jeux-iphone-ipad"
17075,I'd be curious to see a top list of all F2P software from you.
17076,"elite squad 8.5? realm of champs 7.5? both of those games were huge disappointments man, the only way these two can get on the top 10 list is if they are the only game in town"
17077,"Its just my favourites list bro. Iam a fan of simple, idle relaxing turn based games."
17078,"yeah sorry, I didn't mean to sound like a dick lol, I was just very excited for both of those games and they just let me down massively (especially marvel).

I also like sort of idle games, but elite squad just felt like they didn't put any effort into the gameplay at all, and copied a lot from strike force design wise (like the orbs and style is a massive rip off). I just didn't understand why they couldn't do their original thing, its Ubisoft. I expected more personally. but I'm glad you enjoy them!"
17079,Hated realm of champions due to bad matchmaking. Most of the missions ending a failure and is frustrating. But i liked TC elite squad. Playing a bit of it daily. Now at Level 50.
17080,"FTL on iPad is probably my all-time favorite iOS game. Honorable mention for Flick Kick Football, Tiny Wings, Plague Inc."
17081,100% FTL on iPad. But I don't play a ton of iOS games so maybe I'm not the best judge (most other games mentioned are on consoles so... yeah)
17083,"Flick kick is like that, not as artful as tiny wings but fun repetitive simple/one-handed gameplay."
17084,FTL is hardcore game?
17085,I don’t know about “hardcore” but it’s really challenging and once you get into it you’ll be hooked. Love the music too.
17086,"It’s weird to say but I wanted so bad to get hooked, tried really hard multiple times and never could get into it. Awesome music tho!"
17087,"It’s posts like these that make me see the diversity of gaming, and at that the diversity in the greatest of games. FTL is possibly my GOAT. I remember sort of hating it at the very initial outset and thinking it was just terrible from my first couple of short ending runs. Something like “wtf this crap is just full of rng. They clearly had better guns than me, why should I end my run to that.”

But then suddenly *snap* I was hooked on the next run by seeing some kind of strategy open up.
This game has strategy where you didn’t realise there was strategy even some 50 hours later. It’s one of those.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t be in to it as well, in fact the opposite and back to my original point that variety and what anyone likes in a game is a beautiful thing."
17088,I have it on PC but i'm assuming it's the same. It's a roguelike space game where you control a group in a space ship and have to get to a certain planet to survive some sort of solar eruption. Pretty damn hard game. Lot's of strategy involved. Dying is not necessarily bad as you get more stuff to upgrade and get basically more OP the more often you restart
17089,"I think you might have it confused with a different game. In FTL, you play as a Federation ship on a suicide mission trying to take down the rebel flagship to end a long war between the two. You also don’t get any more powerful when you restart, so it’s a purer roguelike in that sense. You can unlock more ships and stuff though if that’s what you meant."
17090,"Lol, yep, OPs description of the premise of FTL had me LOLing and confused at the same time.
I mean the “more op the more often you restart” was straight of the handles of what FTL actually is, and was the last sentence too, and for me gave the final tip off that yep, OP can’t be talking about FTL."
17091,What that doesn’t come up in my App Store. Been tryna get it on mobile forever
17092,"It’s only on iPad, I wish I could get it on iPhone too!"
17093,Here on pubs where people shortened game title so anyone else have no clue of what is it actually
17094,The full title is Faster Than Light.
17095,"Google “FTL”, tell me the first hit you get from that."
17096,"Star Realms

Prison Architect

GRID

Dream Quest"
17097,"Dream Quest!!

The rogue-like CCG to rule them all.  Makes STS seem like child’s play."
17098,Not had it long to be honest- but really like it!
17099,"I love Slay the Spire, is Dream Quest similar?"
17101,I upvoted to every mention of Dream Quest
17102,"The best part about this post is people talking about games I never see discussed. 

I hate that 90% of the time when anyone asks for game recommendations it’s always the same games that get recommend. Gonna have to peruse this to find some new ones to play."
17103,"-Civilization 6

-Planescape Torrment
-Icewind Dale
-Neverwinter Nights
-Battlehearth
-Tsuro"
17104,I can't believe this is my first time seeing Tsuro on this sub! Amazing digital port
17105,Genshin Impact and Arknights
17106,Genshin Impact and Dead Cells
17107,Kingdom Rush (all!) & Dungeon Warfare
17108,Dragon Quest 5
17109,"Dream Quest

Best rogue-like CCG on iOS.

A game that you can simultaneously play for 5-10 mins at a time and will take up all of your free time!"
17110,Dream quest is a gem! That developer went on to work on hearthstone I believe.
17111,Only single player?
17113,"In no particular order:

- Horizon Chase
- Graveyard Keeper
- Barbearian
- Dead Cells
- Swords of Ditto (really gotta push myself to finish this one)
- Kingdom: New Lands
- Crashlands
- Rogue Legacy
- Reigns (Lapse, Reigns: Her Majesty) - i'm ashamed how much I play these...
- Beat Cop
- hocus

Edit: Holy shit, forgot to mention

- BAD NORTH - gameplay and art style are pretty unique!

And some freebies to kill time when in a rush.

I’d say current are: Card Crawl, FAIF, Hue Ball, Jaipur, Morels, Solitairica, Good Sudoku, Chip Chain, Muertitos, Domino Drop, Dungelot, Horizon Chase, SpellTower, Hoplite, Really Bad Chess, Mini Metro, Desert Golfing, The Firm, Drop7, Black Paradox, Atomik, Call of Duty Mobile"

I LOVE this game. Still have it on my phone and old iPad. It’s not even that the gameplay is that great but it’s all about the atmosphere and concept. Apparently the dev thought of it when he got stuck in the desert"
17121,"Legends of Runeterra. It’s a good mix between Hearthstone and Magic and it’s extremely F2P friendly with a lot of depth. The meta is extremely diverse and they put out new content all the time. Gameplay rewards smart plays and never gets stale, unlike other card games. Amazingly well done game, there’s a reason it won Game of the Year for the App Store in 2020"
17122,"**My top 5 games would be:** 

* Football Manager 21 Touch
* Darkest Dungeon
* Project Highrise
* Stardew Valley
* KOTOR 1&2

**And top 3 free to play games would be:**

* Cytus 2
* League of Legends Wild Rift
* Soda Dungeon

There are a whooooole bunch of other paid games that I absolutely adore like Prison Architect, Company of Heroes, etc. but the ones I chose are my essentials."
17123,Have you played Soda Dungeon 2? I got kinda burnt out on 1 and haven't bothered with 2. I'm wondering if there' enough new stuff to make it worthwhile
17124,"It's a lot like the first game. Just like the first, I found it really fun for an afternoon and then never went back to it."
17125,"Sorry, I haven't played it. Probably it's more of the same with a few additions, which can't be bad right?"
17126,Cyrus 1 and 2 seem to be 2 bucks each
17127,"Don't be fooled tho. Asian rhythm games end up being quite expensive if you want to expand your library, but for people who enjoy rhythm games, the DLC is totally worth it for the most part. 

Anyways, for 2 bucks, Cytus 2 has a bunch of content that you can unlock by playing."
17128,Is wild rift even playable on iOS yet? The website says it is not out yet [https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)
17129,"It’s not playable in the Americas but it is in Europe, Oceania and some parts of Asia. I live in Mexico, and downloaded the game with a VPN set to London. 

The game plays like a wonder on iPad Pro but I stopped playing because it doesn’t have role queue yet, and even after ranking up to Emerald, match after match there was always 3 DPS, or last person to choose went Ahri or some shit instead of the jungle we needed, then it was a shower of ”Retreat!"" pings, Turkish cuss words, and it culminated with someone going AFK or feeding 0-22.

There’s a slim chance that when it’s released here next month we’ll have role queue but I wouldn’t hold my breath."
17130,How is FM compared to its PC brother?
17131,"There are two versions: 

**FM Mobile:** Very, very streamlined and restrictive version of FM. If you like the PC version, this one might serve as a quick fix but that’s it. 

**FM Touch:** This one is ALMOST like the PC version in every aspect. You get the same interface, deep strategy customization, booking, finances, different departments to take care of, different modes and unlocks and you get the 3D match view. The missing stuff is actually welcomed. Long gone are the tedious bits of the full fledged version which imho, just added random frustration, like the press conferences, team scoldings and those conversations where you need to babysit and fix everyone’s problems. This version is actually sold on PC too and a lot of people prefer it over the regular one because it’s more like the old FMs."
17132,"You convinced me. I was eying Mobile for the longest time, but just wasn’t turned on by the severe drop in features vs the PC version. I honestly had _no_ idea FM Touch was even on the iPad. I always thought Touch equaled Mobile. I just bought it. Thanks for the response! :)"
17133,"Oh shoot! I wasn’t trying to lure you into buying it but I hope you’re enjoying it as much as I am. If you’re ever curious about the minuscule differences between the PC and Touch version, you can visit the Steam Store page for FM Touch or probably watch a condensed explanation on YouTube."
17134,"Oh no! Your response just broke the camels back for me to finally buy it. I’ve played FM on PC for years, but now that I’m taking on more responsibilities, i don’t have time to sit in front of my PC and play. If it’s similar, but on my IPad, and on the go? I’m sold! Time to scream in anger while on the toilet because I blew it again with The Cherries!"
17135,By a mile: Talisman Digital Edition
17136,"I’m just so polarised on this game. In a simple take, it’s just a dice game. Everything is about a dice roll. 
In another take, it’s a comfortable strategy fantasy game, great for kicking back and seeing how some light strategy pans out against the dice rolls.

Honestly not sure it’s anywhere near my top 20 though even. (I’m not trying to put your opinion down though). 

Have you tried other digital board games on iOS? Through the Ages and Race for the Galaxy are brilliant as is Star Realms. Those are some of my faves for board games."
17137,Cultist simulator
17138,"I really had trouble understanding this game and ended up deleting it before giving it a fair chance. 
Is it a good game or just a pretentious gimmick?"
17139,"It is a really really good game a really good *cult* following. It’s definitely a hard game and it get unapologetic for that but I recommend giving it more time. It definitely has many moving parts and layers. 

I’m a lover of all things Lovecraftian so this does it for me."

17150,"Definitely interested. But also anxious. Good or bad, I wouldn’t resent its presence, since I don’t have to play it, but I’m curious how it’ll play on the smaller screen. Subset didn’t spend time putting FTL on the iPhone. I’m not sure how much money that saved them, but I think it was a smart call. Making it playable on the phone seems like it would be a challenge. I feel like DotE might be in a similar category."
17151,So not to be like shameless promo and I know my game still needs my ongoing work but I've wanted to build it since the original Android G1.   I spent past two years on it and just released.... ironically only on iOS right now.

I loved Oceanheart as well.

Plants vs Zombies 1

I play a few more here and there, but after quitting Hearthstone a year ago these are the games I keep coming back to. I guess I like mild strategy without crazy difficulty. 

I was excited to purchase Slay the Spire when it released, but quickly realized that after 100+ hours on PC I was a little burned out and the iOS controls were too slow for the pace I’d gotten used to. Same thing happened with FTL. As a casual player, it can be surprising how much reducing moves per minute can slow a game down to a crawl. Even using a mouse on the iPad doesn’t compare to a computer. If I’d started these games on iOS, I’d probably still be hooked on them. 

Not sure why I explained all that, but there it is."
17185,"**Sky: Children of Light** 

Sky is a masterpiece. It's a sort of MMO-lite but can very much just be played as a single player experience. That said you will undoubtable run into other players and have some organic experiences from those interactions. Aside from its social elements the core gameplay is about the movement and exploration. Apple actually help fund the development of Sky and it started as an iOS exclusive.

**Dragon Quest 8**

Dragon Quest games are like the comfort food RPGs. I love the wholesome tone to the characters and righting. The Akira Toriyama art style gives the series an identity that separates it from the generic anime look of most JRPGs today. The gameplay is traditional random turn-based battles but the optional auto-battle feature keeps them from becoming exhausting in-between boss battles. I'm in it for the progression of building your party up with new skills and gear and then the amazing story.

**Super Mario Run**

My go to mobile game for quick play sessions. It really captures the Mario experience well and I love replaying levels to try and collect all five of the pink, purple or black coins. It adds a puzzle like element to the game and forces you to master the platforming. Aside from the main World Tour mode, Toad Rally and Remix 10 modes are a lot of fun too.

**Fire Emblem Heroes**

This is a F2P gacha game but Nintendo is very fair with their F2P games. You can play as much as you want for free and they constantly give you free summons and the ability to earn the orbs to summon new heroes via gameplay. Heroes is a great mix of single player and PVP modes that capture the authentic Fire Emblem gameplay. It's a ridiculously deep game from a meta and character building perspective so be prepared to do some research if you get into it.

**GWENT**

Gwent is one of those simple to learn, hard to master type of games. As card games go it seems very basic at first but as you get better cards and begin to understand the different popular deck you see just how deep it really is. Be prepared to put some money into this one if you want to get a decent deck quickly."
