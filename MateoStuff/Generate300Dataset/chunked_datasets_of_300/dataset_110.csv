35064,He didn't include Jim Brown either.
35065,"Steve Largent, Jordy Nelson, Wes Welker, Julian Edelman, Ed McCaffrey, Adam Theilan, Brandon Stokley, Austin Collie, Adam Humphries, and JaMarcus Russell"
35066,"Hmmm. All Scrappy, sneakily athletic white wide receivers?"
35067,Yeah Jamarcus was like a gazelle out there in his prime.
35068,I'm getting a hint of Scrappy with a mild after taste of gym-ratty. Fortunately I carried that delicacy in my lunch pail.
35069,"God, Largent was such a badass"
35070,"Yeah he was, playing against whoever wasn't eligible for the draft lol"
35071,Lunch Pale Attitudes
35072,Jamarcus sounds a little too exotic. Best leave him off the list.

35084,Can't believe this is the first Johnny U mention I've seen
35085,This is almost my exact list except I had Jerry Rice and Jim Brown instead of Madden and Unitas.  Madden didn’t have an NFL playing career so he doesn’t belong.  Couldn’t argue against Unitas though
35086,No Peyton?
35087,If the question was most marketable he’d be #1 for sure.
35088,"Meanwhile people are putting Bo Jackson above him lol

Much less Deion. He was much more marketable but not half the player."
35089,Wrong Johnny. You meant to say $$$ Manziel $$$

35093,Jerry Rice?
35094,Bo Knows! Super Iconic. One of the first athletes I can remember getting his own ad campaign
35095,"Yeah that's why he's famous lol 

One of the most overrated players ever. Yeah he was athletic as fuck but in the end he was cut short by injury and never amounted to much. He's more famous because of advertising than he ever was as a player."
35096,"Go watch him in his prime, he was amazing!"
35097,"I was alive during the entirety of his career  

He's over rated as fuck and I'm not just saying as a Broncos fan."
35098,"Joe Namath, Tom Brady, Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Jerry Rice, Lawrence Taylor, Bart Starr, Dick Butkus, Jom Brown, and Jim Thorpe"
35099,Iconic?  Troy Polamalu

35106,"To me these guys are unimpeachable 

-Tom Brady

-Jerry Rice

-Lawrence Taylor

-Deion Sanders 

-Jim Brown 

You can argue everyone else. You can debate whether Payton or Sanders deserves to be the other RB or whether a Montana, Manning, Graham, Starr or Unitas should be the other QB’s. Moss, TO, Largent or Hutson."
35107,gotta add Joe Montana and Reggie White to that list
35108,"And since you said iconic...  I will add Refrigerator Perry...  He was freaking huge (pun intended) in the 80s, even had his own GI Joe as I recall."

35132,"I bet half these names are forgotten in 50+ years while guys like Sammy Baugh, Broadway Joe, Mean Joe Green, etc will be remembered."
35133,Who?
35136,"So Rodgers, Mahomes, Brady, Allen along with Kelce, Ramsey, Donald, Henry, Adams, and maybe Garrett?

EDIT: I fail to see why I have downvotes"
35137,"Rodgers, Brady, Mahomes, Kelce, Adams, Donald and Henry should be guaranteed top 10.

I would consider TJ, Diggs/Hill/Ramsey and Allen to round the top 10"
35138,"This thread is so annoying as a Seahawks fan lol. Russ isn’t just getting left out of the top QB lists, he’s also getting beat by the guys top weapons? Imagine thinking Adams, Kelce, Henry or Hopkins hold more value to a team then Russ."
35139,"Homer take. 

* Kelce has been the #1 TE in stats for a while now, and has been Mahomes security blanket for the last 3 years. 
* Adams was literally the best WR in 2020.
*  Henry has been the engine on which the Titans offense runs
* Hopkins made Kyler look much better

Russ is great, but he wasn't elite down the stretch, and certainly not top 10 material"
35140,Sub TJ Watt for Dhop and that’s probably it.
35141,Myles has to be up there
35142,"Maybe not in the top 10, imo he’s in the mid 20s."
35143,"Not gonna lie in my mind he's getting 12 but I just don't know whom he's replacing. Maybe Kelce/Tyreek since they might reduce each other's votes. I'd love seeing Garrett in the top 10 tho, love me some more defenders."
35144,"Mahomes, Rodgers, and Donald are the only 100% guaranteed top 10 guys. I don't think Hopkins makes top 10 even though I'd say he's the best receiver in football."
35145,"Brady will be too, SB champ and the GOAT isn't out of the top 10"
35146,Pretty sure they vote in like November.
35147,"I don't think so, they usually have super bowl players up high."
35148,"You can look at my other comment, but they vote around Thanksgiving. They try to do it in tandem with the Pro Bowl voting.

Turns out, Super Bowl winning teams often have good players."
35149,They start around November but end around april [https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/05/inside-the-top-100-voting-process/](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/05/inside-the-top-100-voting-process/)
35150,"Do they really? That's an awful lot of time between getting votes in November and then releasing the list in August.

And this is a list of best players going into 2021, right? Doesn't make sense to vote in November and then ignore the most important part of the season."
35151,"I'm not 100% on that, but I know they do it before the playoffs. I know November was tossed around a ton back when Lamar won it in 2020. It was a huge deal to some people that Mahomes wasn't 1 and the explanation provided was they vote in November (cannot confirm), but definitely before playoffs."
35152,"I think you're probably confusing this ranking with the Pro Bowl voting, that does close out in November."
35153,I am not.
35154,"Interesting. Then I would say that it still doesn't make any sense to vote before playoffs, if you want to predict who the best players will be going into the next season"
35155,"Found this from a ProFootballTalk article. Couldn't grab the link because my mobile browsers are sometimes funky, but they vote on the list and Pro Bowl at the same time.

""All players are given the opportunity to vote through ballots we send to all 32 teams around Thanksgiving,” NFL Network spokesman Alex Riethmiller told PFT via email.  “For convenience sake, we try to time it with Pro Bowl balloting, so they can do them together.  In addition to ballots collected that way, we also give ballots to many of the players that we interview for our shows.  This year, in total, we received 481 votes.”"
35156,"That’s from 2013 and you left out the key part:
>	The voting period extended from late November 2012 through early April 2013.

It’s pretty clear these rankings are taking playoff stuff in to account with how the voting is going."
35157,"Thanks. I scanned that article, and it looks it's for the 2013 season. I also saw this excerpt  


>The voting period extended from late November 2012 through early April 2013

So not sure if what you quoted is the norm, or if the voting process keeps changing every season. Regardless, we'll just wait and see who the top 10 are"
35158,No you’re confusing it.
35159,That's why I'm skeptical of Brady up there. Especially since the bucs were like 7-5 before Brady went full Thanos mode and never lost a game for the rest of the year lol I think he might get like a 8-9 slot just out of respect.
35160,"Tbf, he was #14 in 2019, when everyone thought he was ""washed up"". And he only had 24 TDs in 2019

With the stats he had in 2020, coupled with the fact that he did that with no OTA and offseason, he should at least be top 10, and most likely top 5."
35161,Brady just quit or something?
35162,"I've seen over this sub that votes are cast in November, so I made my comment based on that. The Bucs struggled relative to expectations up until their bye week, so if Brady isn't top 10 it's because of that."
35163,It looks like ballots get sent to players in November but voting happens until April. It’s been pretty clear that the voting is influenced by stuff like the SB.
35164,"Adams and Kelce are locked in for top 10 as well. No one matches the stat production of Kelce among TEs, and Adams was the best WR in 2020."
35172,Russ
35166,"This is it. There is a guaranteed top 3 in the top 10; 

1. Aaron Rodgers
2. Patrick Mahomes
3. Aaron Donald

Everything else I have to think about. Made a quick list, and it's hard lol"
35167,As long as TJ is above Garret
35168,I daydream about Garrett having the surrounding talent that TJ does.

8. Adams   
9. Wilson   
10. Tyreek   

I could see any of the top 4 being #1, but based on previous lists there seems to be some hesitancy with Mahomes. Rodgers would fall right in line with Lamar last year, just the dominant MVP season.   

Brady could jump up of course, but I'm not entirely sure when voting was done. In past years they did it right before the Super Bowl. Either way, he'll be up there.   

Donald is just the safe choice that I guarantee will be top 4, just doubt he has enough support to be #1. Maybe something happens where Rodgers/Mahomes/Brady eat into each others' votes, but doubt it.   

Very confident Henry, Kelce, Watt and Adams will be the next group. Henry's season was historic, so he gets the nod. Could see any of the next 3 in any order though.   

Russ lost a bit of shine this year but he'll still be top 10. Maybe someone like Allen starts eating into his votes though.   

10 is a bit of a wildcard, but I'll go with Tyreek. Just think he's too much of a gamebreaker. Players with really splashy skillsets usually do really well in these lists.   

I can see Ramsey and Garrett challenging for 10. Maybe Hopkins but I think he drops just outside. Allen is the wildcard, I don't think he'll be top 10 though."

35216,"It would actually be a Kentucky buck...an Irish buck would be with Irish whiskey. Like with a Moscow mule, the Moscow indicates vodka. A Kentucky mule would be with bourbon.

35292,Order a drink for a girl and then drink it while she's not looking.
35293,Bar across the street makes super strong bottom shelf screwdrivers for €1. Obviously I don’t go there unless I plan on not remembering that night and quite possibly waking up next to someone I don’t recognize.
35294,"Idk. It's just delicious And easy, so I think pretty much everyone can enjoy it"
35295,"Moscow mule, uhmmm"
35296,Titos Mule.
35297,"Being an Austinite, anything and Titos!"
35298,Question regarding Titos. My boyfriend argues that Titos is the crappy vodka people get for college house parties that no one actually likes...I keep arguing that he's mixing up Titos with something else cause Titos is respected  as far as I know! Even his friends agree with him (they're all in college) so I just wanna know what if I'm the wrong one here haha. I love Titos and visited it's distillery in Austin but I'm no expert by any means regarding alcohol.
35299,Are you sure he isn't think of Fleischmanns or Skol? Both are 13 dollars or less for a 1.75
35300,"Your boyfriend and his friends are dumb. No one spends the extra money on Tito’s for a party unless they really want Tito’s. No one buys liquor in glass bottles for parties either (at least not a second time), and I’ve never seen Tito’s in plastic."
35301,My drink right there. Relaxing and smooth.
35302,Whatever has the highest alcohol content per ml at lowest cost per volume.
35303,if you are in australia you cant go past a sack of goon
35304,Fruity Lexia makes you sexia
35305,You doin ok my dude?
35306,Hopefully a student rather than an alcoholic!
35307,I am indeed.
35308,Do you just like drink Everclear then?
35309,So Everclear?
35310,"Maybe you should try a nice, refreshing lager beer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5gQ_rruDmc"
35311,Long Island Ice Tea. Only takes one and you're good to go.
35312,"> Long Island

It really depends on who's making the drink. I've had some long islands that are great! Then again, there are some bartenders that put too much sweet n' sour mix, which can make it taste like lemonade. I work in a restaurant and am friends with the bartender, so all of my Long Islands bear a wonderful resemblance to gasoline."
35313,"What it really depends on is if they use the full amount of liquor called for in a genuine Long Island, which I believe is at least 1 oz., possibly 1.5oz. of *four* different liquors. If they’re using that much, I don’t give a shit if it tastes like lemonade. Unfortunately, most places don’t put that much liquor at all. If you go to chain restaurants, you’re probably not getting more than 2oz. of liquor in a Long Island."
35314,Yeah the reason for that is that the kind of people who order long islands are generally not the kind of people you want drinking long islands
35315,"well, this is true."
35316,I think im doing it wrong if thats the case
35317,"Yeah, that’s a ~3-4 drink for me. Proper buzz though. Just feel like a douche ordering one because when I bartended so many problem starter customers drank long islands. So many crying girlfriends and wives..."
35318,Mojito or White Russian.
35319,White Russian is a lot easier. No muddling involved.
35321,Well that’s just like your opinion man
35322,"White Russian is scary cause you gotta keep track of what you drink that night. I once drank a white Russian and a whiskey ginger back to back.

It was miserable."
35323,Whiskey and coke!
35324,"Used to be my go to until I had to get off caffeine. Did caffeine-free Coke for a while, but it wasn't the same. Tried some other mixers. They're all ok. Finally tried cream soda on a whim. Holy hell, it's amazing. Might not be for everyone, but definitely worth a try."
35325,"My cousin told me about any apple whiskey+cream soda, just tried it tonight. Caramel apple taste, its fucking amazing (using jim beam apple for it)"
35327,Pure fucking Amsterdam vodka. The burn makes me feel good.
35329,"This man drinks. I’m the same way. Really, really dive spots call for a gin and tonic. Well. Short glass. Feel the burn. They have a bunch of run down Chinese restaurants that turn into dive bars in Seattle and I would get fucking trashed for $20 bucks and would leave with delicious Chinese food for the evening. Miss that city."
35331,Wallingford had one that has been there for years. Like the “downtown” Wallingford strip. The other is Chen’s village in the inter bay. Enjoy my friend. Have one for me.
35332,Moon Temple. It closed a while back. Many of these old Chinese dives have closed with the gentrification of the city.
35333,"Seriously? That sucks, I heard about the “death” of pioneer square but walingford? Guess the pre-recession Seattle of My memories and dreams is a different place today. Sucks to hear."
35334,Tequila and tonic with lime.
35335,Woo hoo! Me too!! Idk people who drink tequila with tonic & it always gets a confused look from people when I say this.
35336,"A nice imperial stout or scotch. If neither are available, the fruitiest goddamn drink they serve - and the motherfucker better have an umbrella."
35337,Apple cider & Fireball.
35338,"My go to. Called ""angry balls"" in my neck of the woods. But i do whatever i can to get a cinnamon whiskey that isn't fireball. Shit tastes like an angry cinnamon altoid mixed with paint thinner."
35339,Vodka Gimlet.
35341,You've got me curious now...
35342,4 loko
35343,There it is. Shotgun one and I’m good for the night. Completely trashed.
35344,"I once shotgunned (not the whole thing) a 4loko. Cherry flavored, it sprayed the ceiling and when it dried it wasn't pink anymore."
35345,ahh the amount of times i've puked off those is absurd
35346,"One of my roommates in college had a couple of 4 lokos, was bouncing on the couch, and then gave himself a concussion from hitting his head. 
Was kinda amazing but also horrible."
35347,The one alcoholic drink that can make you wake up the next morning in a sewer without you pants with no recollection of the time between the drink and when you woke up
35348,Malort.
35349,Flaming homer
35350,"The Flaming homer? You mean, the Flaming Moe. And your dad didn't invent it you wuss. Moe the bartender did."
35351,Big fan of a mojito.
35352,Amaretto sour. Tastes like candy
35353,Almost like a cherry limeade to me. My go-to as well!
35354,Riot Juice or Fight Milk.
35355,"Sounds great, can you recommend some sort of alcohol-infused meat to go with it?"
35356,R u m h a m
35357,"Disaronno and Dr. Pepper.  So smooth, you don't realize you're buzzed until it's too late."
35359,I'm at the point in life I don't drink to get drunk.  I drink to unwind after a long week.
35865,Tequila
35363,Whiskey in a glass. Preferably Irish.
35364,Jameson?
35367,"If you like Laphroaig 10 (which, incidentally, is my favorite scotch) you owe it to yourself to try all the Islay malts. Lagavulin is the nearest to Laphroaig in character, but they're all special in their own way. Read up on what makes Islay malts so distinctive, I guarantee it'll make you fall in love with them. Skye and any coastal higlands have similar virtues, and there are a smattering of other island malts worth trying. If I can lay hands on any of those, I'll pass over several more expensive bottles from other regions of Scotland.

Also, try Japanese whisky. It's made with similar ingredients and similar methods to scotch. I don't know much about it, as I'm just beginning to discover it, but I've never tried one I didn't like."
35368,Screwdriver or white Russian. I like girly vodka drinks that don't taste like alcohol. If I'm not going for a mixed drink I also enjoy apple cider.
35369,Margaritas of all types. Also I make a wicked frozen vodka lemonade.
35370,Colorado Kool-Aid.      *Coors Light*
35372,"7&7
Anyone?"
35373,Fernet
35374,Malibu and orange juice.
35375,Malibu and pineapple juice is just as tasty!
35376,"Brandy Old Fashioned, sweet."
35377,Cheap vodka chased by cranberry or orange juice.
35378,"Vodka in fruit punch if I'm at home and want to blow an evening, or an IPA-style beer of my choice."
35379,"Jameson and ginger ale

If I’m low on drink money, it’s becomes Hamm’s or Canada House with chaser."
35380,"Old fashioned!!! 

But if I really feel like drinking I go straight to an AMF  :)"
