24165,"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou - Similar to Toradora!

Toradora! - One of the best romcom. Would consider one of the standards in that genre.

Angel Beats! - the feels man. they hurt.

Darker Than Black (both seasons) - lots of action, dark themes

Fate Zero - more serious moral themes. 

Guilty Crown - Amazing sound track for the series. Not sure why it gets SO MUCH HATE. I honestly thought it 
was a good anime. 

Isshuukan Friends - Don't see this one mentioned very often so i had to add it. Very light hearted warm romance. Found myself rooting for the MC multiple times."
24166,I haven't seen many people mention them but so far Akame Ga Kill is extremely good and is ongoing. another one is Deadman Wonderland it is short but I think it is definitely worth a watch
24167,"6 Franchises I consider essentials. Not the same as my favorites (which include Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi) and in particular order.

Steins;Gate

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

Death Note

Samurai Champloo 

Cowboy Bebop 

Haruhi Franchise"
24168,"Highschool dxd, mightiest disciple kenichi,clannad&after story,katanagatari,yu yu hakusho, & naruto. If you can find one you like out of that list you don't like anime."
24169,"GITS

GITS Innocence

Sword of the stranger 

Akira 

Paprika

Ninja Scroll

Fist of the North Star

Spriggan

Golgo 13

Mezzo Forte (uncut version)

Sword for Truth"
24170,"Simple: Code Geass, DeathNote, Mirai Nikki(Future Diary), Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Steins;Gate, Baccano, Durrara, Blue Exorcist,
Black Lagoon, Hell Sing Ultimate, Beserk, Gurren Lagann, Another, Anohana, Cow Boy Be Pop, Trigun, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Samurai Champool, Full Metal Panic, Ganktusou, Guilty Crown, Welcome to the NHK, High School of the Dead, Hajime no Ippo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Fate/Zero, Clanned, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu, Hunter x hunter, Gintama, Monster, No Game No Life, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Ghost in the Shell, Angel Beats. Damn theirs allot more.... Well i have seen all of these and there all good (8.5 or higher out of 10). Not only my opinion but these are also the generally top rated anime. Enjoy"
24171,"Late to this, but, in no particular order:

1. Ergo Proxy - definitely an 'adult' anime: big idea sci-fi, intentionally slow at times, and occasionally a little expository, but a lot of fun if it's up your alley.

2. Samurai Champloo - Ersatz period show with a great mix of genres. Funny as hell at times, but also serious at times.

3. Another - To me, at least, the most accessible 'thriller/horror' anime. Nicely coherent short run, too.

4. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Slice of life meets supernatural meets comedy. Also: you need to watch this series to get the jokes in about 50% of comedy AMVs.

5. Jungle wa Itsumo Hare Nochi Guu - This series makes no sense at all, and is glorious for it.

6. Madoka Magica - So freakin' good. Turns the magical girl genre on its head and is incredibly coherent for a [insert spoiler here] story. That said, this series is more delicious once you've been watching anime/reading manga for a while and can appreciate how it twists tropes.

Bonus: and, of course, the classics: Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, etc."
24172,"Bleach
Full metal Alchemist 
One piece
Naruto
Shakugan no shana

24173,"If nothing else, I just have to recommend Fate/Zero. If you like fighting, vast array of amazing characters, and a deep world to sink your teeth into, you can't go wrong with this show. It doesn't hurt that Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works just started up too 

Other suggestions: Kyousou Giga, Steins;Gate, Penguindrum, Shensekai Yori, Madoka Magica"

24175,"1. Bakuman

24177,"If you are a fan of SAO watch Log horizon, its like sao but focuses more on mechanics of the game which they are trapped it. 
IMO a better take on the ""Stuck in videogame"" trope"
24178,"My Must Watch animes will be:

[HunterxHunter](http://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter): Not only this thing is fun but thrilling and EXTREMELY entertaining. You really get hooked up even though it's freaking long. You should watch both of them but I think the 2011 remake is better.

[Great Teacher Onizuka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-7TQXvdll0): Long story short, just the worst person in the world becoming a high school teacher. 

[Detroit Metal City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYIhZLEDSgw): You will not find anything funnier than this guys, TRUST ME. I've seen Gintama, Toriko, and I laughed my heart out with GTO but this... THIS IS A GEM. I can assure you this will always cheer you up if you're having a bad day.

[Log Horizon](http://www.crunchyroll.com/log-horizon): If you want to actually understand a little bit about your world, this might be really helpful. Take .hack//Sign and mash it up with SAO and you'll have this. It's a really really good ""I'm stucked in a VMMORPG for life"".

[Fate/Stay Night](http://www.crunchyroll.com/fatestay-night): Has a huge saga over and behind it and I can say it's a pretty well developed fantasy series. It has magic, blood, sexy girls, and a huge background (somehow pagan) which made it into a huge very successful saga. I has 2 prequels, 2 spinoffs and a lot of videogames.

[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://www.crunchyroll.com/kids-on-the-slope): One of the most amazing music based anime series I have ever seen. With music composed and rearranged by Yoko Kano (best known for her work on the Cowboy Bebop's and Wolf's Rain's OST) it will give you some of the most amazing jazz standards played beautifully. Also, the animation is really pretty and fluid and the story behind the characters and their development makes this one of the Seinen series I recommend to every single person I meet. 

Hope you like them :)"
24179,"Well, if you were to hop into a time machine and ask teenage me what all the best *MUST SEE* anime is, he'd certainly say: **Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, Fist of the North Star and Neon Genesis Evangelion**.

I on the other hand, that is adult me, would probably say: **Kaiji Ultimate Survivor, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GiG, Steins;Gate, Detroit Metal City, Death Note, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 2012**.

Both lists are valid, as far as I'm concerned."
24180,"Can anybody recommend good anime on netflix? I've seen fullmetal alchemist and war on titans, so many options not sure what to watch next"

24194,Ashita no Joe is so low on this damn!
24195,"If you have any blogger friends who like Ashita no Joe, ask them to publish a list of their favorite anime!  Maybe it'll enter the top 100 in a future update."
24196,Ashita no Joe is my no. 1 anime 😢
24197,"Sorry about that.  It was actually in an older version of the top 100, but then I added more lists and it dropped off.  I'll do my best to find more lists with Ashita no Joe."
24198,"That’s fine, i can understand why it’s pretty low, since it’s not a popular series for newer generation especially"
24199,And...... Favorited. Time to get started
24200,War in the Pocket being on here made my heart leap.
24201,"War in the Pocket was in an earlier version of the top 100, but then I added 2 more blogs and it dropped off."
24202,When I get my hands on those pesky blogs...!
24203,How the fuck is 3-gatsu so low? O.o
24204,"It was made in 2016, so it's still pretty recent.  It'll probably enter the top 100 as more bloggers publish new lists."
24205,That's... A good point
24207,Durarara (one of my favorites as well) at least is locked in the super tie at 102.
24208,"I kinda expected DRRR to be where it is. It's probably in my top 10, if not top 5, but I can see why people might not think it's very memorable. It only really shows how great it truly is after the first or maybe even the second rewatch. All the details, the foreshadowing and the connections can't be seen on the first watch. 

Anyone who's rewatched it at least once will 100% have it in their top 100 imo, but that's the problem, many people don't do that. 

# ALSO JOIN THE REWATCH THAT'S STARTING IN APRIL HAHA."
24209,"I'm there if it's not when I'm working! But even then, still might start rewatching it!"
24210,"Sorry about that.   Gintama and Durarara were in an earlier version of the top 100, but then I added some more lists and they dropped off.  And some of the lists were published before Attack on Titan became popular.

Maybe they'll enter the top 100 in the future when I update it."
24211,Attack on Titan is in the runner up list at 111 at least.
24212,Surprised to see Hellsing as the runner up and not Hellsing Ultimate. I always got the impression the original was not especially liked
24213,"Hellsing was on 3 lists, and Hellsing Ultimate was on 2 lists.

One of the lists is from 2002 (the Animeboards poll), and Hellsing Ultimate didn't exist at the time."
24214,"I assumed Clannad being in there meant it included After Story, but the fact that After Story is not in the top 100 but Clannad is makes me question these ""experts"""
24216,Fairly certain After Story is what they're most likely referring to or the anime as a whole.
24217,"I just edited the list, and now ""Clannad franchise"" counts as a vote for After Story.  As a side effect, Clannad is higher on the list, because there was actually one poll where After Story got more votes than season 1."
24218,">As a side effect, Clannad is higher on the list

Excellent"
24219,"I just doubled checked.  5 people explicitly mention both seasons, but they only have a single ""Clannad"" entry on their list.  There are also 2 polls where it just says ""Clannad"", without specifying if they mean the franchise or the first season.  1 person lists it as ""Clannad"" but there's a link to After Story.

I might consider changing it in the next update, but it won't make a big difference.  Either way, the higher-ranked Clannad will be somewhere close to the middle of the top 100.  I guess it's a question of which one will confuse fewer people."
24220,Agreed. Clannad isn't a contender for top anime unless you include season 2. Season 1 is very average.
24221,How in the world is Clannad: After Story below Clannad?
24222,"A lot of people are asking about Clannad.  Many of the bloggers had a single entry for ""Clannad"" to represent the entire franchise.  To avoid redundancy, I counted it as a vote for season 1.

I just edited the list, and now ""Clannad franchise"" counts as a vote for After Story, and I added a note.  Hopefully it's less confusing now."
24223,Surprised and happy to see Bleach here in the lost.
24225,"Both great anime and well-deserving of their spot.

If you like Penguindrum, you'll probably like Utena (made by the same director), which is #3 on the list."
24226,Ranma 1/2 is 69. Nothing else on this list matters.
24227,"My list of acclaimed anime has 10,000 entries, all of which are Extra Olympia Kyklos."
24228,Used to watch ranma as a kid (I know) don’t remember much. Is it really good and worth a watch?
24229,"I think he's more commenting on the fact that the show about the topless gender bender is 69, if you know what I mean."
24230,"It's a nice list, with many fantastic anime, but considering you compiled it from a list of blogs and ""experts"", you should probably mention those as references.

It's still an entirely subjective list with those references as well, but having references to what sources you've used, would make it a bit more trustworthy, as we know the lists this list is compiled from. There is some anime I'm surprised is missing from the list (Ashita no Joe as an example), which makes me interested in seeing what sources are used."
24231,"Here are the 33 lists that I used.  A few of the lists contain things that aren't anime series, but I removed those.

A compilation of 136 anime bloggers' favorites (it hasn't been published anywhere)"
24232,"Nice, that's fantastic. Seems like you had the sources ready, in case someone was asking for them, which is always great, since it makes the list much more trustworthy (without sources, it tends to just look like a personal list).

Really like the list BTW, since it seems more varied than most lists out there, as it's not as heavily skewed towards male+dark+action anime as many ranking pages from the west, tend to be. Still very few kids anime (only Heidi of the Alps), but that's to be expected when gathered from online rankings, and it's 1 more than expected."
24233,"Despite being a kids anime, Heidi seems to be pretty popular among Japanese critics.  It got 3 votes in [this poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6z2spq/top_anime_and_anime_directors_voted_by_japanese/).  It was also #56 [this poll](https://www.nishikata-eiga.com/2010/10/laputas-top-150-japanese-and-world.html), which includes both Japanese and non-Japanese animation.

There's also Cardcaptor Sakura, and there's Doraemon in the runners-up."
24234,"What was the criteria for which to choose? Or did you just gather as many as you could?

Like if I just type in Google ""top anime of all time"" the first result is from Japan Wireless, a Japanese wifi rental company, but it didn't make your cut. Or like NHK's poll from their commemoration of 100 yrs of anime."
24235,"I looked for lists that seemed to be made by knowledgeable anime fans, and had a good amount of variety.  I avoided lists that focused too heavily on a single genre or a single decade.

I found both of those lists, but I decided not to use them.  The JW list looks very shounen-heavy, and it only includes anime that are available to stream.  The NHK list looks like there may have been some vote-stuffing."
24236,"There is an internationally voted poll in response to the NHK list done by an anime youtuber, and I think that list looks more fairer than NHK one.

Its shonen heavy at the top, but you can't deny that there is a group of people who only watch shonen anime or highly rate shonen anime."
24237,"Thanks for the link.

I knew about that list, but chose not to use it (because it's shounen heavy, like you say).  And one of my goals was to have an alternative to the shounen heavy lists."
24238,"Thank you so much for this. So many anime lists are written through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy and I often find myself wading through hours of explosions and fanservice to find anything remotely of interest to someone who hasn't been a teenager for a couple of decades. For example, neither Mushishi nor Cowboy Bebop making the top 25 at [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) says a lot about the voting demographic."
24239,"The MAL list has a lot of sequel bias.  Sequels tend to be overrated (on every website, not only MAL), because anyone who dislikes an anime is unlikely to watch the sequel.  Among the non-sequel series, Cowboy Bebop is #6.

But yes, there are a lot of teenagers on MAL.  It would be interesting if we could see the average rating for each age group."
24240,"There is nothing inherently wrong with any particular list on your compilation, but don't you think your selection of list skew slightly more towards the older animes?

And I am saying this as an older anime fan. I was very surprised by how many early to mid 2000s anime that were in your list, and when I saw your selection of list, it all made sense.

A lot of these were written in the 2012, 2013, 2014 etc. Alot of the big 2010s anime haven't came out yet/barely made it cultural impact. There is even a list that was written in 2001.

A few one that I can name of that didn't make into your top 100 or were placed too low - Attack On Titan, One Punch Man, Jojo, Demon Slayer, Made Into Abyss, Haikyuu, My Hero Academia, Promised Neverland, Kaguyasama, Re:Zero, Sword Art Online. Note, this aren't my favourites, in fact I haven't even watched some of them, but clearly they had an impact in the anime industry / anime fandom."
24241,"It depends on your definition of ""most acclaimed.""  If it means ""anime that received the most praise,"" I think it makes sense to skew toward older anime.  Evangelion has been receiving praise for 26 years.  Attack on Titan has been receiving praise for 8 years.

If that doesn't make sense to you, you can just look at the top anime of each decade, instead of comparing different decades to each other."
24242,"I definitely agree with your definition. But I am not arguing for any particular anime to be ranked higher, but just that if the list was written when the anime haven't even air, it obviously won't even appear in said list and will be ranked lower in the overall rankings. Like Demon Slayer won't even appear on your overall ranking because 90% of the lists were written before it aired.

tldr : Somehow you need to give the late 2010s animes a fighting chance. If you're doing this again, maybe consider add more recent (post-2015) list in your compilation?"
24243,"I'm always looking for new lists.  I'll add them as I find them.

I might consider making a list that specifically focuses on 2010s series, but my next project is going to be ""most acclaimed anime movies"" (I already started working on it)."
24244,"You're right, but I'm kind of ok with this because none of those shows need more attention, and every listing site has major recency bias."
24245,"If an anime is good, it will beat recency bias anyway. 

Evangelion is a good proof of that.

And alot of his list has ""recency bias"" according to the time it was written."
24246,"You may have seen this already, since you have The Cart Driver at the top of your sources, but that blog did something similar to your project back in 2013.

http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/"
24247,"Ashita no Joe is #114, and it was on 5 of the 33 lists.  It was inside the top 100 on an older version of the list, but then I added a few more blogs and it dropped off."
24248,Madoka that high?! Wow!
24249,That's Gen Urobuchi for you! The one that revolutionize an entire genre.
24250,"I'm pleased to see Usagi Drop and Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu on the list

Edit: oh shit. Just looked at the list again and I see Natsume Yuujinchou! I'M SCREAMING"
24251,"All three of these shows are some of my tops of all time. Stoked to see Monster, Chihayafuru, and Spice and Wolf on here as well!"
24252,"Madoka, Lain and Haruhi all in the top 10. Now that's a top I can get behind."
24253,"I love all 3.

Someone else criticized the list because they thought Haruhi was too high.  I guess it's impossible to please everyone."
24254,It's honestly impressive that Madoka is ranked at #4 since the first three shows are very old. And it looks like Madoka is the only anime from 2010s to rank on top 10.
24255,Not surprising since Madoka Magica is probably the most lauded anime title of 2010s.
24256,"Seeing Made in Abyss on this list made my heart soar. It’s such an amazing anime, and one of the few that made me dive straight into the manga."
24257,"Thank you for making this list, this is the second list that I have seen that I like. I have seen 86 from the top 100 and a couple of the ones missing it's because I read the manga instead, already added some to the PTW"
24258,"I'm glad to hear you like it.  I've only seen 49, so I still have a long way to go."
24259,this list is instantly good because Hidamari Sketch is on there
24260,"Thanks for the recommendation.  I watched a few clips and it looks interesting.

I noticed it's by the same director as Madoka Magica (although it's a completely different genre)."
24261,"If you like Slice of Life and Shaft you will love this show. Its literally all I wanted after I watched Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Madoka Magica and the Monogatari Series. Still one of if not the top Slice of Life to this day for me."
24262,"Same director, character artist, and studio. Madoka Magica is basically Hidamari Sketch + Urobuchi."
24263,"What a wonderful trip down memory lane. So many of my favorite shows, some of which I haven’t thought about in some time. Thanks for making this."
24264,Crazy to see Tenchi slide in for the 100th spot.
24265,Thank you for compiling this list! I watched and loved Cowboy Bebop and have been watching and loving Attack on Titan and have been watching youtube rankings to see what i might like next. Started Demon Slayer and do like that along with Death Note. Couldn't stick with Full Metal Alchemist but am going to try FMA Brotherhood. So many more to try from you list.
24266,"I'm glad to hear you like it.  I hope you find some interesting anime to watch.

If you like Cowboy Bebop, you'll probably like Samurai Champloo, and maybe also Baccano."
24267,"There are quite a few surprises on this list, but the biggest one for me is Eve no Jikan. I've never seen anyone talk about that movie/OVA, so I didn't really know it had fans out there (besides me lol)."
24268,I occasionally see people praise it on Reddit.  It was on 5 of the 33 lists.
24270,"It's still fairly new, but I expect March Comes In Like A Lion will probably enter the list within a year or two, as bloggers publish new lists."
24271,Nice to see NHK and Higurashi on a list
24272,"I haven't seen Higurashi yet, but I like NHK.

You can thank the [RYM Forum](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/).  They voted NHK the 10th best anime.  (it was on other lists too, but the RYM Forum certainly helped)"
24273,Glad you had Dennou Coil (#90) in there. It is one of my favourites and I’ve never heard others bring it up. I thought it was an excellent series.
24274,I like it too.  I sometimes recommend when people ask for sci-fi recommendations.
24275,"I didn't expect the magical girl genre to be so well represented here, but most of those on this list I also gave a 10/10. But there's one 10/10 that's missing - Flip Flappers. It's a little too recent and niche to make the list, but I must shill it."
24276,"Flip Flappers was on 2 lists, but it's still fairly recent.  Maybe it'll enter the top 100 in the future as newer lists are published."
24277,"Wow that’s honesty the best top 100 list I’ve seen. All the shows I’ve watched from there are very solid, and the ones I haven’t yet, I’ve heard only praise about. It’s pretty funny that all the shows in my top 10 are in that top 100 except Gintama and even that is in the top 150. Take my award for that really well-compiled list."
24278,"I'm glad you like it.  I'm surprised too that Gintama didn't make the top 100, but it was only on 4 of the 33 lists.  You might like the [Animetacritic list](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/).  Gintama is #52."
24279,I checked it and it’s another solid list though I heavily disagree with the Eva Rebuild 2.0 being rated higher than NGE or EoE.
24280,"When I look at top-rated lists, I ignore the sequels.  Sequels tend to be overrated, because anyone who dislikes an anime is unlikely to watch the sequel.

I made an alternate version of Animetacritic, using the same set of bloggers, but based on number of favorites instead of average rating.  Maybe you'll like this version more.  Gintama got 3 votes.

24281,"I think I like that list even more hahah. NGE, LotGH, Mushishi, Tatami, Gintama, Afterstory, Monster, Madoka, and Monogatari are all so damn good so it’s nice to see them in there. The only problem I had with your original list was Clannad being ranked higher than Afterstory, since that’s one of the only shows where I think the sequel is far better than the original"
24282,"Most of the bloggers (as well as 2 of the polls) listed ""Clannad"" to represent the entire franchise, and they didn't specify which season they like more.  I thought it would be redundant to list Clannad twice, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for season 1, so it would be listed as ""Clannad"" in the top 100, because that's what the bloggers did.

I did the opposite for Aria, because more people specified ""Aria the Origination"" than ""Aria the Animation"", so I counted ""Aria"" as a vote for ""Aria the Origination""."
24283,"Surprised to see Haruhi so close to the top, but I'm not complaining"
24284,"I think Haruhi used to be a lot more popular than it is now.  It used to be in the top 5 on MAL.

Haruhi is actually the first anime series that I watched, so I guess you could say that it got me into anime."
24285,Haruhi is like the *classic* first anime for people in their mid-20s I think.
24286,"I'm in my mid 30's and I think Haruhi is the first ""mainstream"" anime that isn't Naruto/Bleach/Dragonball/etc that I gotten into."
24288,MORNING RESCUE
24289,T-his this is some meme long forgotten.... Thank you
24290,"It sounds right to me too.  You can thank the Japanese critics.  It got 7 votes in [this poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6z2spq/top_anime_and_anime_directors_voted_by_japanese/) (although even without this poll, it still would've been in the top 5)."
24291,"Happy to see Princess Tutu and Seirei no Moribito on the list. More people should watch both.

A lot of action, adventure, or fantasy anime, which isn't a surprise. People really love those genres."
24292,"I liked Princess Tutu, but I haven't seen Moribito yet.  Thanks for the recommendation.  I'll try to watch it soon!"
24293,"Hope you enjoy it, it's a fun anime. I try to recommend it when someone wants either a: Female protagonist, a fantasy, or adventure anime. An anime with an interesting world. Or an anime that has sword fighting in it."
24294,"Bebop second and FLCL seventh. I certainly can't complain about that. This list feels better to me than the ones I see on MAL and AnimePlanet. I understand saying that probably labels me as some sort of elitist or something, but who cares."
24295,"I'm glad to hear you like it.  I made this list because I couldn't find any lists that felt to me like a good representation of the ""anime canon"".

However, there are some other good lists.  You might be interested in the [Animetacritic list](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) and the [RYM Forum's list](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/)."
24296,"I like the idea of an anime canon. Feels like ""elitist"" type people generally understand which titles are in the canon but like you said there aren't good resources to find a solid list. You kind of have to lurk forums to get a clue."
24297,"Despite the negative connotations of the word, the ""elitist"" anime tend to be my favorites.  I've seen several forum threads about elitist anime, like [this one](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1362444) and [this one](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1807052) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5otlxq/what_anime_do_you_generally_associate_with/).  But having a list is convenient."
24298,I was really pleasantly surprised to see FLCL ranked so high. I know lots of people love it (I personally have a hard time believing I’ll ever see a better anime) but I didn’t think it’d be even in the top 50.
24299,"Gintama is the ""elitists"" shounen and 100% deserving of a t100 in anyone's list."
24300,"Really solid list, kinda just nodded my head in agreement through most of it. Not sure I'd put Stand Alone Complex below Steins;Gate or Mob Psycho below Made in Abyss but that comes down to preference."
24301,"Mob Psycho and Made in Abyss are both very recent, so I expect both of them to climb higher in the top 100 as more new lists get published."
24302,This list is fantastic! Thank you so much for putting it together :)
24304,"Looks like a pretty accurate list, mostly corresponds with my experience as well. Thanks for making this!"
24305,I'm glad to hear that you like it.  I hope you find some interesting anime to watch.
24306,I'm glad Made in Abyss and Kyousougiga got on the list... man people need to check the latter out especially.
24307,Usually I have problems with these lists but I actually agree with this one pretty well done.
24308,"Baccano! is higher than Death Note, nuff said"
24309,"I feel the same way, and that's what motivated me to make this list.  I'm glad to hear that you like it.

Although, there are some other good lists.  You might be interested in the [RYM Forum's poll](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/)."
24311,Ping Pong is quite popular on the [RYM Forum](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/).  They voted it the 7th best anime.
24312,"hah, just left a comment saying pretty much *exactly* the same thing, then scrolled down to see this."
24313,"> as well as a few lists made by experts

Why yes, I *am* an expert in anime tit & feet, how could you tell?"
24314,"When I compile the ""top 100 most acclaimed anime tits & feet"", I'll be sure to use your list. :)"
24315,"This is a great list! Very happy to see Evangelion, Bebop and Madoka at the top."
24316,"I'm glad to hear that you like the list.   Evangelion, Bebop and Madoka are all great."
24317,I love that One Piece is the ONLY one on the list still going!!! GODA!!!
24318,"This is a very nice list, i do think there are a bunch of series deserving of being there that aren't but the ones that are, are still quality ones, at least of the ones that i have watched."
24319,"Some of them might be in the [runners-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/m5te6u/top_100_most_acclaimed_anime_series_of_all_time/gr1ynmu/).  If not, they might still enter the list in the future.  I'll probably to continue to update the top 100 as new lists get published."
24320,"This really is an excellent list, thanks for compiling it, i have many more recommendations thanks to it"
24321,I'm glad to hear you like it.  I hope you find some interesting recommendations.
24322,"I’ve seen about 300 anime but still got a ton of recommendations from this, nice"
24323,I'm glad to hear you found it useful.
24324,"How is Gintama 107?  
I seriously don't know."
24325,"If you have any blogger friends who like Gintama, ask them to publish a list of their favorites!  Maybe it'll enter the top 100 in the future."
24326,A very nice list. Would be interested in a movie version.
24327,"I started working on a movie version, but I want to find more lists before I post it.  At the moment, the movie version is only based on 19 lists."
24328,Looking forward to it!
24329,"I hope Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is going to be in there, not holding my breath though."
24330,"Me too! Probably NGE, Bebop, Akira, Paprika (or some other Satoshi Kon film) and Lupin III Castle of Cagliostro right near the top I'm guessing. And at least three Ghiblies of course."
24331,"Most of the higher tier Ghiblies will probably make it. Wouldn't be surprised to see literally every Miyazaki. Every Kon film for sure with Perfect Blue very close to the top. What I'm really hoping to see is Mind Game and Patlabor 2 perform well. I see overwhelming critical praise for the latter in particular (and Satoshi Kon himself praised the former!) so I'm optimistic. Also interested to see how Yamada does given that she's newer. Liz probably won't make it because it came out in 2018 even though it deserves to, but everything else has a decent shot imo."
24332,"I'd hope for Mind Game too. Love Yuasa (though in general his series are way better than his movies, especially in recent years) and I wouldn't be surprised."
24333,"Yes, everything that you mentioned, as well as most of the Ghiblies, are on the list (I didn't count exactly how many)."
24334,Great list! Thanks for taking the time to make this.
24336,Happy to see Eureka Seven so high! My all-time favorite.
24337,I only recognize 2 from the top 10?
24338,I guess you have some good anime to look forward to.  I like all of the anime in the top 10.
24339,"Def going to save this list. Thanks for the hard work. I only watch English dub, so I figure some of these might be taken off my personal list. Do you have any recommendations? I am about to finish the overly cautious hero"
24340,"Without knowing anything about your taste, I would suggest starting with Cowboy Bebop.  It's a safe choice that almost everyone likes, and it has a good dub (although I watched it subbed)."
24341,Sigh... I havent watched even 20% of the list and I already stopped watching anime.
24342,"Completed 32/100
Very nice list"
24343,"Here is a similar list from 10 years ago: [Compilation of top anime of the decade lists around the internet – Series](https://aquabluesweater.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/compilation-of-top-anime-of-the-decade-lists-around-the-internet-series/). 

This one includes anime from 2000-2009 only so the results aren't directly comparable. But many of the anime on the older list are still present on this newer list."
24344,"I've seen that list before.  It's a pretty good list.  I wish he would make a new list for the 2010s, but I suppose I'll have to do it myself."
24345,"I'm just satisfied Kyousougiga is on there despite it not being very popular, which measn a relatively high percentage of people who watched it think to recommend it."
24346,"K-on at #29, fuck yeah!

Watched 5 of the top 10  
32 out of top 100

Less than I'd like but I know about most of them. Great list."
24347,It's wild that 4 of the top 5 are specifically commentary on anime or deconstructions of genre and medium
24348,Azumanga and Kill la Kill? This list is accurate.
24349,I hope I can find another blogger list that includes Kill la Kill.  I'll be sad if it drops off the top 100 in the next update.
24350,nice work bro
24351,"There's a lot of anime I've never seen on this list which is really cool. I saved this page, so I can come back and pick new anime shows to watch. Thanks for the list!"
24352,I'm glad to hear you like it.  I hope you find some interesting anime to watch.
24353,"In all honesty, entered this post rdy to bash everything and baby rage at an awful list, still dont agree with the list but was very pleasantly surprised to see certain shows make it on this list.

Obligatory Cross Game is the best anime ever made comment, even though i objectively i know its not true and even i dont believe it but my love for the show makes me add this to my comment."
24354,"I'm glad that you like the list enough to not bash it. :)

Cross Game was #170.  It was only on 2 of the 33 lists."
24355,Found which 2 lists i should follow then =P
24356,"This list has Cross Game as #3: [https://animerurouni.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/top-25-favorite-anime-2017-edition/](https://animerurouni.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/top-25-favorite-anime-2017-edition/)

Cross Game is also on my compilation of bloggers' favorites (2 of the bloggers favorited it)."
24357,I believe in TTGL supremacy. Overall pretty interesting seeing how tastes change over time.
24358,"TTGL used to be #1 on MAL, back in 2007-2008."
24359,"TTGL is one of my all time favorites, but I was shocked to see it so high up given changing tastes over time"
24360,"Let's see, I've seen 32 of the 100, including 8 of the top 10. 3 of the top 17 I dropped (FMA Brotherhood, Haibane Renmei and Steins Gate), the first 2 of which I've never finished.

Nice to see the very old, but very loved by me Galaxy Express 999 there. As well as shows like Kyousougiga, Now and Then Here and There and Eden of the East which don't get mentioned enough. Beyond the original Gundam, good to see Turn A there which is one of its best shows.

I'm not going to argue below top 10 for it, but number one overall for Evangelion just goes to show how insanely overrated it is."
24361,"I know so many people who dropped Steins gate. I always found it perplexing considering how good I thought it was. But whenever I ask they say it was too slow and they didn't like the main character. 

I guess this makes a lot of sense because if you don't like what they're offering then the whole first half is closer to slice of life than anything else. Then the second half is the wild half.

I managed to get at least 2 of them to keep watching and they were like ""oh I get it now, it was amazing"" and it makes me wonder how many shows I've dropped because of similar reasons."
24362,"Wow I’ve only seen 5 of the top 100 on this list and 6 from the 101-149

Interesting I suppose!"
24363,"I hope you find some interesting anime to watch!

I like most of what I've seen from the top 100."
24364,"Haruhi at number 10! I feel kinda vindicated after years of people trying to convince me it wasn't that great anymore.

Also Utena at 3 is really cool, wouldn't have expected that at all (though I was certain it would be on this list)."
24365,Clannad makes it in but not After Story?
24366,"Several bloggers listed ""Clannad"" to represent the entire franchise, without specifying which season they like more.  I thought it would be redundant to include both, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for season 1.

I did the same for ""Monogatari"", which I counted as a vote for Bakemonogatari."
24367,"I'm torn about listing Rurouni Kenshin TV and the OVA's as different entities.  

I get that they are different in many ways but I am still torn on that"

24372,"Planetes and Eureka Seven are right there

24373,"Tsuki ga Kirei was only on 1 list, but it's still very recent (2017), so maybe it'll climb higher as newer lists are published."
24374,"A list I can definitely agree with and can refer newbies to! Thank you very much for this work!

Looking forward to your movies list!"
24375,"FLCL is so high up and I have never seen it and no one ever explains what it is, so wtf is it?"
24376,"Hands down, my boi NGE is always on top, on any list,
in every country. The anime with the biggest influence on the market, be it Movies (even Hollywood), References, Manga, Merchandising (had a problem with that back in the days) and the overall influence in all Anime’s/Games/Manga to follow. And it had one of the biggest Doujin impacts on the market."
24377,"I've seen a few polls where Gundam was #1, like [this one](https://www.sankakucomplex.com/2014/03/18/top-50-classic-anime/) and [this one](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime-part-2).  But yeah, Evangelion is definitely on top more often than any other anime."
24378,"Gundam arguably has a bigger inoact, especially since NGE is an anime influenced by Mobile Suit Gundam, and the fact that Hideki Ano is a well known gundam fan. Gundam as a franchise is #21 in the worlds most profitable IP.

NGE is just morr approachable given that is has less media to work with, and reletively speaking, newer and less daunting than Gundam as a whole."
24379,Gainex coming in with three in the top ten
24380,AIEEEEEEEEEEE DAE THINK AOT TOP 10 FOR SURE???? AIEEEEEEEEEE s*creeches*
63487,Ty
24383,"It's a pretty good list but I see the exclusion of Clannad After Story as a pretty glaring flaw.

If you look at the major ranking sites of Japan (Anikore, ranked 12th), China (Bangumi, ranked 4th) and the west (Mal, ranked 13th) it's pretty clearly a top, top anime. In fact it's actually the only one which is in the top 15 in all 3 of the major areas."
24384,"To expand a bit on this I think Clannad being split into two on many lists, forums, blogs and rankings sites actually really hurts it in compilations like this.

Often times sequels aren't counted or attempts are made to merge Clannad S1 and After stories rankings to get an average, both aproaches under rating Clannad severely.

Generally it's viewed that sequels have an advantage as people who didn't like the premise drop the show in S1 and thus never rate S2. I agree with this point.

However it should really be noted that

1) After Story is actually one of the few sequels to make it into that top 15 area across sites. Most entries are single series, it just looks like there are a lot of sequels but it's basically gintama spam usually (and people just think of the whole thing as one entry and vote all the parts up). So while yes it is a sequel and in theory benefits from that, it actually out performs other sequels pretty significantly and simply being a sequel is no free pass as it's sometimes seen.

2) While most shows honestly don't vary much in content from season to season, Clannad S2 really is quite a different beast from the first. Having the pay off split, quite artifically, like this I think actually causes people to underate S1 rather than overrate After Story. I fully believe that if Clannad was simply one entry its score would practically be identical to After Story's now. Take Steins's Gate for example. A show which has a similar build up during the first half, indeed often drawing criticism for it's first half being ""slow and boring"" but yet still commands strong scores across regions. I believe if Steins gate were split like Clannad is into a part 1 and a part 2 you'd see part 1 being lower rated much like Clannad S1 is but you'd see part 2 of Steins gate command the same score as the complete Steins gate does. It's just how shows that spend a good deal of their runtime building up to things work. If the payoff is worth it everything is worth it.

So yeah I'm going off on one but I really do think Clannad's split nature actually dicks it over on compilations like this and explain why despite in many ways being arguably the most universally well rated anime accross the globe is somehow underrated on these sort of critical compilations."
24385,"This. Without a doubt at least a T100 anime. After Story is one of the most influential anime of all time, especially in the slice of life genre."
24386,"5 of the lists had a single entry for ""Clannad"", but mentioned both seasons.  One list said ""Clannad"" but had a link to After Story.  There were also 2 polls that just said ""Clannad"" without specifying if they meant the franchise or the first season.

I thought it would be redundant to have 2 Clannad entries, when the original lists only had 1 Clannad entry, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for the first season.  Maybe I'll change it to After Story in the next update, but it won't make a big difference, because it'll still be close to the middle of the top 100."
24387,"A lot of people were asking about Clannad, so I just edited the list.

Now ""Clannad franchise"" counts as a vote for After Story.  As a side effect, Clannad is higher on the list, because there was actually one poll where After Story got more votes than season 1."
24388,"Thanks for going back and looking at it, I knew it was get fucked over xD

  


I would just count any mention of clannad as a vote for the whole thing. Whether you list that as clannad franchise or just clannad after story is up to you. Idk if you've seen clannad but there is no chance anyone would ever mention it on a list and not be meaning the whole thing. It's just often referred to as just clannad."
