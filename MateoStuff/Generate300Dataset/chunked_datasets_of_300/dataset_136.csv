43616,"I got one on Amazon for $20 and it literally saves my asshole. I used to bleed from every shit, now it takes two wipes"
43617,... bleeding is not normal. You ok?
43618,"I am now!

*This message brought to you by BidetUSA"
43619,"""No more bloody mess!"""
43620,"The box that my bidet came in had glowing user reviews on it. One of them said something like, ""whenever I go to work and I have to wipe like a peasant, it makes me really sad."" I thought it was funny when I first read it, but I've actually had that experience now and it turns out the box was right."
43621,"Meat thermometer. No more cutting open meat to see if it’s done, thus leaking juices"
43622,A good every day carry pocket knife. I use mine serveral times a day.
43623,"Carbon MONOXIDE alarm, please get one."
43624,"A slow cooker

A kindle or library card 

A juicer/blender 

A donation to adopt a pet from an animal shelter 

A printer"
43625,"We've bought 2-3 Kindle Fires on prime days since amazon started doing it, mostly for our kids.  The HD8 is a hell of a little tablet for <$60"
43626,"I like the paperwhite. No beckoning distractions -- it's just your books -- and it's easier on the eyes at night. But if you want an actual tablet, you're right that the fire is pretty good at that price."
43627,Rice cooker
43628,My mom laughed at me when I bought a rice cooker. Now she's a believer!
43629,"A kitchen scale. 

Completely changed my food consumption, since I could easily measure portions. I learned what they actually SHOULD be, not what we in the US act like they are. That + MyFitnessPal (the free version, even!) = Me losing 120lbs over 18 months and developing a much healthier relationship with food and eating. Very simple tools, but great for enacting real, lasting change 👍"
43630,"A folding wagon.  Getting groceries in the house, camping gear, etc we always have it in the car and you can do 5 trips worth by hand effortlessly."
43631,Tongue Scraper
43632,Books. Knowledge is currency that only increases
43633,"Ok, I’ve bought the Twilight series and all of Sean Hannity’s books. Let’s get to work"
43634,"Upgraded my box spring, pillow, and purchased a sound machine before lockdown. I've had more solid sleep and am having quite more pleasant days. I live with anxiety and PTSD and am a cannabis user (medically / proper channels). As a father of 3 (4th in route), life is simply compounding with interior place issues. After I upgraded my box spring and pillow I purchased... a sound machine. To be honest, each of these three things with elevate your sleeping and alter you days to come; not to mention the medical.  Each of these things are separately < $100."
43635,prescription contact lens *edit*  didnt realise how many people would want to know where to order.  So far my fastest option is ordering from opticontacts.com   they will only take a week or less.  Lens.me is another option with more exotic brands but they take much longer to arrive as they ship out of dubia.   Neither will ask for prescription from doctor.  You just manually input your rx
43636,A desk for laptop. Seriously using it on bed or somewhere else isn't as great as it's on a desk. Also a comfortable chair.
43637,"A rice cooker. My mom always said that having one use appliances is a waste of money and space, and as an adult now I generally agree. No quesadilla makers, donut/cake pop machines, etc. I spent almost ten years of my adult life boiling rice on the stove and often times messing it up. It should be simple but for me it just isn’t. I bought a rice cooker on sale and OH MAN. Life changed. It’s even got a steamer basket so it’s not even technically a one use appliance. Perfect rice every time, and you can set it and forget it until it’s time to eat. Frees up a stove burner, and meals where I cook rice now feel a lot easier. I’m willing to die on this hill."
43638,A collar that you can put ice cubes in to help keep you cool. I do a decent amount of outside and digging jobs and this thing probably saved me from heatstroke. And only 20 bucks
43639,"A good set of cookware.   Whether its pots and pans, or a good chef's knife,  every investment I make in my kitchen increases my quality of life.  

Edit: I feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this. For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what ""good"" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils. Just a thin layer with a paper towel will do."
43640,"A good knife and sharpener can completely change your cooking habits. Many reviewers, like America's Test Kitchen, consistently recommend the Victorinox Fibrox chef's knife  for around $40."
43641,A big cutting board is life changing in the kitchen.
43642,"The right shampoo and conditioner. Am dude.

I use this super girly looking stuff called love beauty and planet, and my hair is glorious and I love putting my hands into it. And other people like putting their hands in my hair too. Generally women.

Female marketed products are vastly superior in so many ways, and dudes won't buy it because they're forced into the men's marketed section with bears and wolves and trees that represent shitty college smelling products that are 12-in-1 body/hair/dish/clothes/car wash. 

Hair is hair. Choose the products marketed towards people who give a shit about their hair. Be the beautiful man you were meant to be.

Edit: that is a ton of comments. I'm gonna try to get to them later, but for those who want to know, [this is my shampoo](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/shampoo/sulfate-free-argan-oil-&-lavender-shampoo.html) and [this is my conditioner](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/conditioner/argan-oil-&-lavender-conditioner.html). I used to use Aussie brand conditioner, which did decent things, but felt oily.

Edit2: I have straight hair, but have found r/curlygirl to have great resources. Sulphate free shampoo if where it's at.

Edit3: I'm seeing a TON of people recommend Mane and Tail. I'm sorely tempted to try it after reading all these...

Edit4: Holy shit, apparently there's an 18-in-1 soap. And I thought 12-in-1 was absurd. The kind redditor u/Gilthoniel_Elbereth has put forward https://www.drbronner.com/ for your consideration."
43643,"One of the male marketed products that is superior though is men's razors. I know women that swear by men's razors, both because they're higher quality and lower in price."
43644,"I bought an old fire boat from a scrapyard for $100 years ago, ended up trading it for an amazing jet boat with a 454. I was 16 and all these years later, my $100 jet boat still lives!!!"
43645,"I should buy a boat.

Edit: The amount of people missing the meme is fascinating."
43646,"Trust me, this guy is probably the only person to ever gain money from buying a boat."
43647,"Bail

43648,Just pull out a couple grand from your savings account. Go down to the nearest body of water.  Light all your money on fire and then throw it into the water.  That's what being a boat owner is like
43649,A used pressure washer. It’s like a drug using that thing.
43650,Omg I *love* using those! Also the blower backpack lawn tool thingamajig looks like the same kind of wild good time.
43651,"Good pens (Pentel RSVP 0.5, 2 for $6) for writing lots of notes in lectures."
43652,Pilot G2 or gtfo. I’m not writing a single note otherwise.
43654,Movie pass until they realized they’re going to go bankrupt
43655,"Still for only $10 a month, for most people as long as you watch one movie it’s a savings. I’ve had a lot of time on my hands lately and managed to watch a movie each of the past 7 days straight with it."
43656,"It was perfect for me because there's a theater about 10 minutes driving, but they just dropped it from the app so I cancelled. The rest are way too far and they're AMC so I'm thinking of using their service instead."
43657,Same!
43658,I bought a phone charger that is more than twice my height in length by mistake & at first I thought it was really goofy and was gonna return it but it’s actually awesome & I’m never going back to short cords!
43659,My phone charger is one of the most important items on my travels. Trying to find a wall outlet when your phones dead can be a pain when you're constantly traveling.
43660,"LPT:   Carry 2 chargers and scalp one of 'em at the airport if the opportunity arises. You'll save someone money compared to buying one from the airport gift shop, and your profit will buy you an overpriced airport sandwich."
43661,Just bring a 20k mAh battery and laugh at the unprepared people wrestling over outlets.
43662,"My friend did that.  People mocked his battery, but in a couple of weeks he has charged more phones and vapes than I can count and it still has a ton of battery left."
43663,Just carry 12V 45AH lead battery and you got yourself enough energy for a year.
43665,I spent 20 bucks to find who liked my profile on Ok Cupid. That girl is now my wife.
43666,"Well that's just cost you more money. 

Jk congrats."
43667,Are you sure she's not a well designed AI humanoid? I heard ok cupid is full of them.
43668,"If she's convincing enough that you get married, do you really want to know?"
43669,Freeze all motor functions
43670,"we see you Ok Cupid PR rep /glare

edit: added /s just in case someone thought i was serious..."
43672,"Whoa that's pretty cool. I still actually use my car's cassette deck, and don't want to upgrade to an aux cord one."
43673,"You can buy Cassette-to-aux adapters for like, $10-$15. It looks like a cassette with a cable coming out. Had one in my old Civic."
43674,"I had one of those, and I still can't wrap my head around how it could work."
43675,"Cassettes use magnetic tape to record audio signals to magnetic flux changes recorded on strips. The Aux to cassette bypasses the tape strip and just produces the magnetic field. If you look inside them, they are made to spin since the car still spins them like a normal cassette but there actually isn't a tape in there at all."
43676,"No question, it’s the [Bug-A-Salt 2.0](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0439/2657/products/Yellow_In_Package_002.png?v=1499277571). It’s a pump-action air gun that shoots table salt (costs around $40). They market it for flies but it works especially well for mosquitos. I love blasting those assholes out of the sky!"
43677,And now you got salt all around your place!
43678,You’re telling me I can kill mosquitos and protect myself from supernatural evils all for the low price of $39.99!
43680,"Seriously. How do you use that thing without completely messing up your place with salt? Salt in bedsheets, *the horror*!"
43681,"It's meant for outside. Defend the backyard from mosquitoes, not your bedroom."
43682,I designed and 3d printed a bunch of pointless mods for the thing lol https://i.imgur.com/ZsjQkZ0.jpg
43684,"Is it easy to aim accurately and shoot mosquitoes? Or is it more like blasting in the ""right direction"", more or less, a few times ?"
43685,It's a salt shotgun. Right direction should do the trick.
43686,"My boyfriend has one of these. He calls it the bug shotgun. There was a moth in his bathroom one day and so I told him thinking he would just grab and flush it with a tissue. Nope, here he comes in with this nerf gun looking thing and blasts the moth to dust particles in the shower. I was both terrified and impressed. 10/10 would blast moth to dust again"
43687,My husband bought one on our honeymoon and I thought it was the stupidest thing ever. I’m pretty sure I use it more than him now! Sooo worth it.
43688,"$75 to the pound, got the best dog ever."
43689,Thought this was a currency conversion rate until after the comma
43690,That would be an amazing exchange rate for any Brits visiting the US.
43691,My eno hammock.  Best purchase I’ve ever made over or under $100
43692,"What do you use yours for?

I got a cheap version of that that I hung under my lofted dorm bed in college and slept in every night for a year. I kind of miss that."
43693,I use my ENO single nest for camping. Instead of a tent I set up my hammock & a bug net/tarp & it’s amazing
43694,"Urgh, I bought an emo hammock and my experience with it has been miserable."
43695,"Play some The Cure and let it talk about its feelings. Once it hits 20 or so, it'll mature up"
43696,I spent $5.99 on the mobile Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic game and I play it every single day. I miss being a kid.
43697,Is there anything for zoo tycoon 2? I can’t find that game anywhere. It’s the only old game I would love to play again
43698,Oh man I would love zoo tycoon 2 for mobile! I was thinking about that today when i was playing RCT
43699,"Seconded.    

It is a very high quality port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and works much better on touch than I would have imagined. The only IAPs it has is three expansion sets (Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, and Toolkit), which I'd call optional.   

It is kind of the polar opposite of most mobile games, no annoying ads, no conveyor belt of ""challenges"", limited & valuable IAPs, and deep gameplay."
43700,"I hate how the ""polar opposite"" is literally just how games used to be."
43701,"Wait a second, it's a port of #2?

...

THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING."
43702,Spotify premium $5 student deal. I use it every day.
43703,"Definitely agree here, I love Spotify"
43704,"I don’t have the student deal, but 3 friends and I pitched in on the family subscription for $15/month. We each pay $3.75/month. Still room left on the plan for 1 more too! 

Edit: guess there’s room for 2 more!"
43705,yo let me get in on that! for real for real no jokies
43706,Hey it's me your long lost bro
43707,Cousin! We must go bowling!
43708,"I just have the regular ($9.99/month) plan, but yeah... if you consider how much I use it versus how much it costs, it's by far one of the best bargains ever.

And, in my case, even though I've had it for 3+ years, I've only actually paid for around 6 months out of my own pocket. I'm 47, my ""little"" sister is 43, and our parents are almost 70. So we're at the ""just get me a couple Spotify gift cards for Christmas"" stage. I think I'm paid through until March 2019, but after this upcoming Christmas it'll probably be March 2020."
43709,As a working musician I hate Spotify. As a human being who wants a quality service I love Spotify. My only gripe is with the mobile versions of the app. Some versions have features that other versions don't and all versions are missing a lot of elements that the desktop version has. Even then the PC version is glitchy so you can't win either way.
43710,I really wish they'd add a donate button on artists pages. I've found so much good music and I feel guilty that these people are only getting fractions of a penny per play.
43711,Spotify Premium Philippines family plan. Works out about $15\~ each for a whole year.
43712,A box of condoms to protect against child support. Good so far.
43713,You need to open the box.
43714,"No you dont, just make extended eye contact with a girl while you hold up the box and slowly shake it you also need to maintain the creepy smile . Best contraceptive money can buy"
43715,"If you're looking for a reliable contraceptive, there's a great free one called Fortnite which you can download online."
43716,Bidet attachment for my toilet. Best $35 I ever spent. Life-changing.
43717,"I agree with getting a Bidet, used it once by accident in Korea, apparently it's a thing there (as well as in Japan). It was shocking, but my anus never felt the same after that. Was never satisfied with just paper from that day on, got the bidet at a bargain and pooping has never been the same ever."
43718,"You should try the $800 one Toto makes. That’s like the best purchase we ever made. seat is heated, has a nightlight in the bowl and out, temperature adjustable seat and multiple spray setting with a remote control to customize your buttwashing experience. Cleans the toilet bowl with electrochemically ionized water when done. Lifts the top seat for you with a motion sensor, puts one or both lids down when you get leave.

Only downside is you have to install a GFI outlet by your toilet."
43719,This guy shits.
43720,Man I just dropped my biscuit from reading this lmfao
43721,">You should try the $800 one Toto makes

There's a blessed rains joke in there but I can't quite put my finger on it..."
43722,">I can't quite put my finger on it...   

With a bidet you don't have to anymore."
43723,"When we were in Japan, nearly every bathroom seemed to use Toto products. Half of our bathroom trips ended with somebody singing Africa."
43724,"Real shit 🙏

Once you go bidet you don't go back. For under ~$50 the quality-of-life upgrade is astounding"
43725,"Facts. 
I have one and friends always try to make fun of me for it, then I hit them with “if you step in dog poop, are you going to be content cleaning it with a paper towel or are you going to hit it with the hose?” And I can always see the epiphany on their faces when it clicks for them."
43726,"Easy... my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. I live in an apartment building with 59 other tenants and the walls are paper thin. I've had mine since 2012 and other than having to replace the ear pads a time or two, they've held up very well."
43727,"I have Beyerdynamic DT770s. They cost me a fortune (275 USD) when I bought them in 2012, which was about a week's wages. I bought the warranty for them, but regret none of it. They have lasted six years so far and have gone strong since. I will buy another pair without so much as a second thought the moment these fail. They are certainly not bass bumpers though, but the frequency response is stupidly high, and i can regularly hear tape hiss from CDs that were pressed in the 80s, which were basically analog to digital conversions. Excellent reproduction."
43728,"I have 2 Victorinox knives, a chef's knife and a paring knife. $40 and $7 respectively, and I got a long honing steel for another $8.

I'd only ever used terrible or dull knives before. Using sharp knives and maintaining that sharpness has changed the way I cook. I'm far more confident and in control in the kitchen, and every time my boyfriend uses my knives he's jealous of how sharp they are."
43729,"Looked after properly, one of those knives survived 9 months of daily abuse cutting 400+ loaves of bread a day at one of the Subways I worked at. Then the newbie used it on the stainless steel bench out the back *once* and sadly no more could it effortlessly and cleanly slice through bread :(

So we pulled out a new $6 knife and started tracking how long that lasted."
43730,People who don't use cutting boards make me cry...
43731,This guy didn't just not use a cutting board... he apparently took the knife out of the store to a bench out back and was cutting something up on the bench...  wtf?
43732,Coffee cup reheater. It keeps your hot drinks warm for people like me that often forget they’re drinking it lol. Price ranges from like $12-$20 on Amazon
43733,"A *shitload* of dish towels.

I decided a couple of years ago that I was going to make a conscious effort to deal with all the minor irritations in my life. First on the list was the fact that I never had a dish towel clean and to hand when I needed one. Boom! Problem solved. That tiny little frustration that I experienced multiple times a day -- wiping up spills, getting something out of the oven, putting a hot tray down on a work surface -- was gone immediately.

So I started branching out to other things. Ever spent more than two minutes looking for a pair of tweezers? Or a corkscrew? Well, they're cheap. Buy multiples! Have them to hand! Get that minor annoyance out of your life!

(Here's where someone invariably points out that I could just always make sure that I put them in the same place and solve the problem that way, but let's be real: have you never accidentally knocked something small down the side of the couch? Or lent it to someone and had them not return it for ages? Or even just moved on to something more important, like when you're using tweezers to pull something gross like a shard of glass out of your foot? Having multiples means that you've got a nice little buffer in case your perfect plan goes astray.)

Embrace the multiple."
43734,I like this concept! I did this once too with all the really small stressors in my life because I learned that a lot of small stressors can actually be more stressful than one big stressful thing. I just remember throwing away a ripped paper folder and getting a new one. I wish I could remember what else I did. It was amazing. 😍
43735,Yes! I bought over 30 pairs of underwear so I would never run out.
43736,50+ pairs of identical socks is where the real magic happens.
43737,"1. Contigo travel coffee mug (I think it was like $13 -15). Coffee stays hot for hours, and I stopped buying coffee at Starbucks.
2. Bluetooth speaker- ($10 on Black Friday) elevated my life in ways I couldn't even imagine. I listen to NPR while getting ready in the morning, music while showering, or a podcast while cooking. If it breaks down I will promptly re-purchase it at full price ($40).
3. Spotify Premium ($10/month, comes with Hulu). I use Spotify like 5+ hours a day.

EDIT: I forgot I pay an extra $5/month for Hulu, but it is clubbed with Spotify. I am not a student, just a regular Spotify user. The Hulu is with ads however, and you can't pay extra to get the ad-free version."
43738,$40 waterpik water flosser. For the first time in my life I have decent teeth.
43739,My dentist recommended I get one and I keep putting it off. Is it really that much better than normal flossing?
43740,In my opinion it's not really any better than normal flossing itself but it's so much easier to do thus leading to me flossing more. Ive had a very bad habit of either forgetting to floss or saying screw it I don't want to spend the time doing that but the water flosser is something I can do in about 20 seconds and still feel like I've done a satisfactory job.
43741,My opinion is it’s way better. We’ve had one for about 3-4 months now and I love it.  Feels like it’s removing plaque as well.  You do get a shit ton of water all over till you get good at using it.  I usually put in warm water cause it feels better on my teeth
43742,"I love really nice perfumes and have a collection of many luxury scents. My boyfriend makes sweet comments about how much he loves my perfumes and that he wants to get some nice cologne, but he didn't want to spend that much money on one. So, the other day he came with me to Sephora, and I was smelling and testing perfumes. He tested out a Dior cologne, really enjoyed it, but then realized the price. I could tell he really fancied that cologne, so I bought it right then and there for him. 

He tells me every day how much he loves it and all the compliments he gets. It may not be as cool or interesting as other things, but my boyfriend's joy was enough to make my heart happy. 

Edit: The cologne was Dior Sauvage"
43743,Aw that's so sweet
43744,"I always just buy the sampler sets. You get a ton of cologne samples and a voucher for the full size version of your choice for $80. Bought a Tom Ford Noir with my last voucher, saved $40 off the regular price and still have samples of the others if I want to switch it up."
43745,Was it Sauvage?
43746,"Rite in the Rain notebook for $7 that’s always in my cargo pants pocket at work. While my boss is looking everywhere for scrap wood large enough to write a list of measurements down on and take it to Home Depot, I’ve got a notebook in my pocket for measurements, appointments, the occasional random thought, and less serious things like character builds for video games or deck ideas for MTG.

Had one go through the laundry and it’s too wrinkled to write on now, but it’s still legible. They definitely work."
43747,"Found a 7 year old mastiff on Craigslist for $75. I figured I'd have her for maybe 3 years or so if I was lucky. She made it to 16. She loved people, playing in the leaves, and rolling in the grass. 100% good girl."
43748,"I shared this before but it's definitely the best purchase of my life.

When I was about 10 years old my parents and I were in our backyard clearing out a ton of weeds that had gotten out of hand. I had trouble focusing because our next door neighbor had this really adorable puppy and all I wanted to do was play with him.

We found out that they were actually going to take him to an animal shelter because their son was not taking care of him like he promised. I decided to ask my parents if maybe we could get him instead. I was an only child and never really have anyone to play with unless a friend would come over and the thought of having a puppy to play with whenever I wanted to was great.

My parents agreed and our neighbors offered to sell him to us for $20. I had that saved up and immediately agreed and promised I care for him and love him forever. So, he became my puppy, my brother, and after a few days of debating I named him Snoopy.

Snoopy became my closest friend. He made me laugh, played with me, and would just hang out and watch TV with me. He was always there for me, especially through some tough times in my life where I was extremely self-destructive. He saved me from myself. He was there at my side through tough breakups where all I ever wanted to do was lay in bed. He was an amazing friend. He was there to see me graduate 8th grade, high school, and college. I hoped he would be there on the day I got married and maybe be around for when I had kids, but unfortunately as much as we wish for things, sometimes they don't happen.

He passed three years ago, after being by my side for almost 17 years. Not a day goes by that I don't think of him though and I know how much of an impact he had on my life. Years of friendship, happy memories, and love.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/rSliuc1.jpg) is the first picture of I have of us together and [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9myIo.jpg) is the last.

It never would have happened if I hadn't asked my parents if we could have him. I don't think my life would be the same without him and even though I'm sad he's gone, I'm grateful I had him in my life. 

Edit: [Bonus picture of him looking cool I found while looking for something else](https://i.imgur.com/mNzzEsk.jpg)"
43749,"Damnit dude.. I always read comments where people are saying “omg I’m crying” and I always think “really??” 

But now I’m actually crying a bit. 

My cat has been with me through college, my father dying, an abusive relationship, my moms breast cancer (she’s better now), moving across the country, and some other shit to boot. Anything that’s been significant in my adult life he has helped me through and is the only “person” who has been there through it all. I don’t know what I’ll do when it’s his time and has to leave me. 

This was really touching, R.I.P. Snoopy."
43750,"It's so fucking hard but you'll know when it's time and you'll hold him so gently and tell him you love him so that it's the last thing he'll hear in this life. He'll fall asleep enveloped by the love of the person he loved most in the world, and that is more than most humans are lucky enough to have. Treasure the time you have left together."
43751,"Such an awesome post. I had the same thing happen but with a cat. 18 years together. He passed when my daughter was a few months old. Every child should have that bond with a pet, especially kids who have a hard time with friendships. He was my first best friend and my best."
43752,"I’ve had my cat for 13 years now and have started having to put her on meds for a thyroid condition. Last November out of paranoia, I put her on a healthcare plan that subsidizes some vet treatments and free checkups. We caught her condition within a month of it beginning thanks to that and I’m extremely optimistic we’re going to be able to manage it. Cats are some of the best companions ever."
43753,That's a good boy if I've ever seen one.
43754,"I'm not crying.

Not suitable for all depending on individual medical history."
43756,Lol a friend of mine is in the 0.01% which these fail group. She is married so it's not all bad but I don't think she wants a kid at 20..
43757,Got my implant for $5.20 for 3 baby free years
43758,"Valve Software's Orange Box.  It came with Team Fortress 2, Halflife 2, Portal and something else, I think.  Paid $35 for it and got at least 4000 hours of play time from it."
43759,"Same, but I bought it on summer sale. I think it was $5"
43760,"Pretty much all the valve games have excellent discounts annually, if not more frequently.  Portal 2 is up there with the orange box.  LFD2 is pretty solid, too."
43761,"Noise-cancelling headphones. I didn't think you could put a price on ignoring loud people, but Sennheiser did."
43762,Not debating their awesomeness but these are way over $100
43763,That thing you clip into your car's A/C vent to hold up your phone.
43764,$30 rice cooker on sale from amazon. Chinese takeout quality rice every time. It even steams veg and fish!!
43765,Okay maybe not the best but a $20 plant light so I can keep real plants during the winter. There’s just something refreshing about having plant life surround you during the darker months of the year. You just have to be careful if you have pets to make sure they’re not toxic to them!
43766,"A hand-held wand scanner. It has saved me hours
of work and i can carry it to where the items i need to scan are instead of taking items to my office and then back to the archives. And not everything works on a flatbed scanner."
43767,"SSD, you can get up to 480GB for under £100 now but my first was a 120 for £70. It's a complete game changer and the difference is _insane_, my PC now boots before my monitors are on and ready to go. Programs open in no time and run like a dream.


Beware though, it makes computers with hard drives intolerably slow and frustrating to use."
43768,"Toothpaste saver from dollar tree. I think it is easily the best purchase I have made in terms of money spent ($1) to money saved (easily fifty bucks with my very advanced Completely Winging It estimation system).

You hook it to the back of the tube and roll it up as you use toothpaste. When you are done you pull it out, and there is NOT ONE GLOB of toothpaste left. Fucking black magic."
43769,Edge of a counter
43770,"Yeah, but how much was that counter?"
43771,Foiled again! If it wasn't for you meddling kids
43772,I have never worried about the tiny amount of toothpaste left in the tube when I throw it out. Is this what rich people feel like all the time?
43773,"Actually, pretty much. Being able to discsrd things without concern for your ability to replace them is a trsdemark of relative financial security."
43774,I just squeegee my toothpaste tube with my toothbrush. Works pretty well.

43782,"They’re amazing. My impact driver has lasted years, and despite hours of use every day, has powered in so many screws that it leaves my arm trembling. 

I guess we both mean the same thing, though?"
43783,One of those little barbeques? They *are* great.
43784,"Yup, great storage systems, and a real steal for under 100$."
43785,I got bored and bought a bass guitar once for $89.
43786,That's a pretty cool thing to buy when you're bored tbh
43787,I bought a wool poncho off a guy from Ecuador for 50$. Friend with me at the time said it was stupid. It's cool looking as hell and keeps me so warm. I've walked through blizzards in that thing and it works great.
43788,"Pizza Pizzazz 

https://www.target.com/p/presto-174-pizzazz-plus-rotating-oven-03430/-/A-521123?

It's like $50, and we thought it would be so dumb, used every once in a blue moon.  We were wrong. They marketed that thing all kinds of wrong.  It's perfect for heating up tons of things quickly, like pizza rolls, chicken nuggets, fries, quesadillas, etc PLUS it's great for reheating other things that don't do well in the microwave (leftover pizza, leftover grilled sandwiches). As a parent with a bunch of kids, it's been great and we use it a lot."
43789,"Here's a little trick I picked up.
1. Take cinnamon rolls and unroll them except one. 
2. Put the rolled one in the middle and roll the rest of them around it and make a giant cinnamon roll 
3. Set for 10-15 minutes
4. Boom cinnamon roll cake"
43790,"I didn't eat a whole tube of cinnamon rolls, I only had one..."
43791,Had one of these bad boys in college and we would make everything we could put on there when we were drunk. Everyone of my friends ended up buying one too.
43792,"I love the *concept* but how do you know how long (and at what setting) to do things for?    

For example a frozen pizza will say e.g. 425 for 16 minutes, how do you translate that into something the Pizza Pizzazz can do?"
43793,"No clue.  True story: we've never once used it for a frozen pizza.  But if it's like everything else we use it for, you just throw that bad boy on there for a while until its sizzing and then you look at it.  You can eyeball pretty much everything with it."
43794,"I had one of these until one of my roommates put the tray on wrong. To explain to the non-pizzazz owners here, the little tray spins and the heating elements won’t turn on unless the tray is in and the timer is turned.

My roommate somehow put the tray in such that it wouldn’t spin, but it still hit the sensor to let it turn the heating elements on. It ended up starting a small fire and melting the one section of the tray to the point it wasn’t usable anymore."
43795,"My Wife gave me a music stand, less than $30 and that was 14 years ago before that I was always straining to play my guitar with music in my lap or on a table etc. Im a better guitar player because of that music stand."
43796,Blackout Curtains. I don't know how I ever slept without them!
43797,This summer - A fan for our bedroom. We don't have central air and the house is always muggy. For whatever reason most times if I am sitting I need a blanket on me or at least part of me so of course that doesn't help. Got fed up of barely being able to sleep so I bought a 50 dollar fan from Target and it's amazing. Has all sorts of settings and really cools me down so I can actually sleep.
43799,You can outsource the punches to me. I'll pay a premium if they're my coworkers.
43800,"I think you just linked this so that you could increase the amount of people that you can legally punch 

Very clever"
43801,Shhh. Delete your post and I'll delete the punch i owe you.
43803,Anker 6ft. lightning charger cable. 20 bucks for the convenience
43804,$35 anker portable charger for my phone here. Very reliable. Could never use anything else.
43805,"I went to the bathroom once in middle school. There was a kid in there letting other kids kick him in the balls for $1. 

I know a bargain when I see it."
43806,Medicine for depression + anxiety: the best $25 a month subscription money can buy.
43809,"Girl here. Every med is different but some mess with libido/ability more than others, and some not at all. Sertraline (Zoloft) has worked the best for me. The worst was Prozac and escitalopram. Each person is different. The most important thing I can say is: give it time to work, and don’t stop taking it when you “start feeling better.” You’re feeling better because it’s working and stopping can put you back into the rut you just came out of."
43811,"Me too. I have a great psychiatrist who noticed I might benefit from a higher dosage of a stimulant (Adderall XR) and a lower dosage of my anxiety medicine (Lexapro) and after suffering through major depression and the causing lack of energy and interest in life, I truly have never felt better. I had been through so many medications that didn’t work for me and it was a relief to find something that didn’t make me feel like a zombie or jumpy and hyperactive."
43812,Leatherman or Gerber multi tool.
43813,"I'll second leatherman, but not gerber. I've never had anything from them that Ive had luck with. Not even their knives."
43814,My dog. She is napping next to me. :3
43815,"$75 adoption fee for my kitty.  They say money can't buy happiness, but sometimes it does.  5 years of happiness, and hoping for many more."
43816,"I bought a life sized Allosaurus Skull from a garage sale at some out of business highway attraction for a hundred bucks, so probably that. https://imgur.com/a/avgDwLB"
43817,Love the doily.
43818,"Bought some dill weed for three dollars - when I was in camp, they made noodle soup, which was essentially hot water colored yellow with some noodles with no flavor. No one really liked it but kept that feeling to themselves. The next time we went to Walmart, I bought some dill weed and that weekend when they served the soup, 15 kids went up to me, asking for some spice. Best purchase I ever made."
43819,"“So...Spice? Do you spice? C’mon, I’m cool...” -Scanlan Shorthalt"
43820,"A $25 small space heater I bought for my first winter in Montreal. Turns out many of my apartments had insufficient insulation, or just straight-up holes to the outside world through old doors etc. So that little space heater saved my life basically every night for 5 dark and cold Montreal winters."
43821,"A second swing (used) so my twins could nap in them as babies. It was maybe $40, and it was worth every penny. I could not deal with newborns taking 20 minute crap naps that only overlapped by 5 minutes and then being super cranky because they didn’t nap. 

We transitioned them to napping in cribs around 8 months, so their sleep wasn’t ruined. And in the meantime, Mama had some sanity."
43822,"TSA Precheck (AKA TSA Known Traveler). It costs $85, and you have to consent to a background check and get fingered printed BUT in exchange you get 5 years of access to the TSA Precheck lane. No body scanner, no removing your shoes and belt, and you can leave your electronics in your carry on. Plus, the line is usually a lot shorter since not many people seem to take advantage of this program. 

I travel a lot for work and let me tell you, this thing changed my LIFE. So much faster, so much easier. I was running late last week and I literally only made it to my flight in time because I got to skip the regular security line. I highly recommend it to anyone in the US who flies at least once a year."
43823,"My wife and I have TSA Precheck, but we never applied for or paid for it. One flight several years ago it just showed up on our boarding passes and has been there ever since whenever we fly. Yeah its great, we're thankful but have no clue why we have it."
43824,"$5.00 timer like you put on your lights when you go on vacation.  I hook up my electric blanket in the winter set to turn on about an hour before I get in bed, so it is toasty warm!  Then it turns off a few hours later so I don't get too warm in the night.  I felt brilliant when I figured this out!"
43825,It would be a good idea to check how much current is designed to go through the timer if it's lower than what your blanket draws you might set yourself on fire
43826,Safety razor. $20 chrome handle has saved me $100s in blades over the last 12 years.
43827,"I'd say my aeropress.

I'd had a few coffee machines in the past and not only were they a pain to clean, I had two break in the space of a month.

Decided to take a punt on the Aeropress. Literally use it every single morning and all it needs is a quick rinse under the tap when I'm finished and leave to dry.

What a bargain"
43828,A 60 dollar waluigi costume. Got the pieces and everything.
43829,My bipolar medication. It’s cheap it helps control my cycling and makes it to where I can actually be a mom and be a wife instead of someone I honestly don’t feel like remembering.
43830,Exactly what I was going to say! (I mean aside from the wife and mother thing) 10/10 best thing I’ve ever purchased for myself
43831,"A king size silky/fluffy blanket from Walmart. I’ve washed it and it stays the same soft texture.

It’s cool for summer and warm for winter, plus feels awesome if you’re nekked. Think it was $40.

Edit: it’s in one of my posts, the white one with cats sleeping on it."
43832,"I bought a sandwich cooker/press thing for $1.50. The ability to make your own called sandwiches was amazing. As I type this however, I realize there's also a stove."
43833,"My 4 inch memory foam mattress topper. 

Being I can’t work due to health issues (28 years old) and we live paycheck to paycheck. So getting a new mattress wasn’t gonna happen. 

Around that time was my birthday and an Amazon gift card $100.  

I found one that had good reviews. It was about $75 I think. 

Before this I got one of those cheap thin ones that lasted a few weeks tops.  

But this one.  It’s so good. I HIGHLY recommend getting one that’s at least 2 inches thick.  

We spend so much time sleeping.  And how we sleep Will always affect our lives.  Our general mood. Health.  Work.  Interacting with people. Everything. 

I’ve had it about 4 years now and it’s basically the same as the day I got.  And that carries a lot of weight because I’m in bed like 90-95% of the time because of all my heart/lung issues."
43834,I got a 2 inch mattress topper and it makes a world of difference.
43837,"Not my purchase but my parents but it's for me so it technically counts - my ADD meds, back in third grade it became so bad that I zoned out for the whole day and just stared at the wall or something getting nothing done. After the meds i became a good student and could actually focus, its since gotten better but the procrastination has stayed and is still really bad"
43838,Bought an Apple TV 4 for $80 and I don’t even use my direct tv anymore
43839,AAA. Roadside assistance and free towing under 100 miles.
43840,"My Rocketbook Everlast notebooks come to mind.  They are reusable notebooks that pair with a phone app so you can scan your notes and send them directly to a number of places you pre-set (such as emails, Google Drive folders, etc.). The notebook pages come clean when you whipe them with a damp cloth. It's incredible. I never lose track of my notes anymore and I love that I'm not wasting paper every time I draw a doodle. 

Edit: comment used to say Rocketbook Wave, but that's actually an older and far inferior model."
43841,"Bosch Laser Distance Finder. It has a crazy accurate level built in. Can find wall/room/small country area in less than a few minutes and zap it right to my phone via bluetooth. 

We call it Gary Lasereyes"
43842,Plan B.
43843,NERF guns and alcohol.
43844,Do they come with friends?
43846,A raspberry pi and stuff to go with it.
43847,"Meh, there are better single-board ARM computers these days."
43848,For beginners?
43849,"More or less. A couple are actually derivatives of the Pi, but with different IO stuffs and a different SoC. 

I mean, at the end of the day, they are all.  They have a CPU, storage, and memory got memory. You put an OS on it and run software on it. Not all that much different than the desktop box I'm typing this message on."
43850,"Except for being so inexpensive as to be nearly disposable, making it perfect for automation/simple computation projects. 

I remember reading some futurist book about how one day we'd go to the convenience store and ""pick up a 10-pack of computers"" and found the idea laughable at the time, but goddamn...the Pi comes pretty close."
43851,can you school me a bit on this?
43852,If you are smart enough to set up a pi you are smart enough to set up a different board
43853,"To me, the Pi isn't so much about the hardware, but the community surrounding it."
43854,I thought you had just misspelled pie.
43855,A chromecast!
43856,"Ok, so my parents have a Roku, and it seems nice, is chromecast better than a Roku in any way?"
43857,Can you open web pages on a Roku? That would be the only thing I can think of.
43858,"You can't do that on a Roku. But my goodness, that sounds awesome! :)"
43860,"Yeah, my parents are leaning towards a Roku right now. I don't spend much time at home though, so I'm not really pushing them either way."
43861,I just setup a raspberry pi + xbmc for my dad this weekend. Him and my mom love it.
43862,You can do screen mirroring on the new ones.
43863,"Roku's way nicer in my opinion. Chromecast doesn't work in as high quality for me, and it's deceptively limited as to what I can throw up there.

+1 for Roku."
43864,"I have a smart TV, but it doesn't support Amazon Instant, and it looks like Chromecast doesn't either, so I'm not sure if it would be a good fit. Roku does, however, so that's a big plus."
43865,"If you uninstall Microsoft's Silverlight from your computer, I'm pretty sure you can watch Amazon Prime videos on Chromecast."
43866,"You don't have to uninstall, just change your video option in your Amazon settings. And for me, the video came out very jerky on the TV, even in SD."
43867,"Chromecast Beta lets you cast your entire screen to the TV, letting you cast essentially anything. My dad streams amazon instant from his PC laptop over chromecast and has no issues."
43868,"Yeah Roku's pretty flexible that way. I'm kinda starting to sound like a fanboy in this thread, but it just works really well for my tastes and needs. YMMV."
43869,"You could go for the amazon fire tv stick. I bought one when they were announced and I love it so far. Comes with a remote control so you don't have to rely on your phone to cast content like you do with the chromecast. Has amazon prime, Netflix, hulu, pandora, and plex, plus lots of other stuff that I never use."
43870,"However Chromecast is easily extendable, and with Google support behind it, we'd only see more apps appearing as time goes by."
43871,"Are you using the streaming stick, or the Roku 3?

Thinking of getting her the streaming stick as a gift for her wall mounted, but I want the fastest option for HD tv!

thx!"
43872,"The roku stick is pretty nice, but the 3 excels in speed. The stick does what you need, but it's a little slower to load the titles in Netflix, and even loading the apps. The 3 is better if it's not going to be moved around."
43873,"While the quality may not be 1080p, I disagree that chromecast is limited. Through a PC, the beta version of chromecast lets you cast your entire screen to the TV, letting you watch essentially anything from you computer, any file type, and not just via a chrome browser."
43874,I'm literally using a chromecast to type this out.  You can view anything on  the chrome browser onto your tv.  When you set it up it'll tell you to download the extension (which appears next to your url bar) and you click that and Bam! whatever you have on chrome goes to your tv and is pretty instant.  IDK what everyone else is talking about
43875,"That sounds great, right now I'm looking for something that will play Amazon Instant, my smart TV doesn't do that, just Netflix and Pandora or some shit. If I were able to play Amazon Instant through Chromecast, I would be sold, but that doesn't sound like the case."
43877,"If you have hbo, you can cast hbogo through the chromecast. You can't through the roku"
43879,"In passing, the UALALALALALALALALALA ACTION! movie is apparently a REAL THING. I think I might have to order it, to go along with my collection of gonzo and fucked up -xploitation movies from the 70s. Mondo Cane, Brotherhood of Death, Werewolves on Wheels, that sort of thing."
43880,I believe you can stream forr Chrome (on your PC) on to you TV
43881,That's great! Thank you!
43882,"You can cast anything in your tab, but sometimes (e.g. Amazon Video) it loads in an independent process of some kind, not sure what it is, and it doesn't work. YT/Netflix works wonderfully."
43883,Or just get an HDMI cable. Stream things straight from your computer to your tv for a huge fraction of the cost.
43884,And no limitations to what you can display...
43885,Wireless keyboard and mouse and you are set!
43886,Batteries are a pain though
43887,"Depends on the location of your TV and computer though. I have a laptop in bed and screen across the room. For 25 bucks, Chromecast is definitely worth it. Plus, Videostream works great for local files."
43888,"Three RC cars, shitty steak knives, balloons, and duct tape.

43917,"Buy a slab of wood from a tree, and like 9 very small axes. They come by for like <5 bucks per axe. 

And you have like the party setup for guys. Playing darts by throwing axes. Protip if it doesn't go alright; The axe needs to make two full swings in order to hit right in, this is achieved with me by taking 3-4 medium steps away from the board.

Every once in a while a handle will break from an axe. But who cares right, for those cheap little axes. I've also found complete metal axes for 10 bucks, which doesn't break. 

Now you tell me throwing axes casually at wood with your friends as a game would not be *cool*"
43918,I can't possibly see how this could go wrong.
