20528,"YES! This used to literally get adrenaline pumping threw my blood... I used to be scared to death of roller-coasters, but I loved them once I was on one. So one day I was with a bunch of friends and we were going on one (this one http://florida-holiday1.blogspot.com/2010/05/top-10-universal-studios-florida.html ) which looked scary as hell. I didn't wanna back out in front of my friends, so I waited in line to get on this ride for half an hour. If someone said much as 5 words to me I might cry. I was extremely nervous and on the verge of tears (but backing out was not an option). I am shaking now just thinking of it. Also on this roller-coaster you get to pick your song that you listen to. Now I had heard this song once or twice before (my brother played it for me) and it was familiar to me so that's why I chose it. I remember shaking extremely uncontrollably and barely being able to press buttons on a screen while wanting to throw up all over the seat. As the ride starts it goes exactly straight up. I couldn't even hear the music because all I could hear was the pumping of blood in my ears and the clik clik clik of the roller-coaster. As we reached the apex I had a literal death grip on the shoulder harness. My heart is racing and I am scared to death. We start down the first drop and my eyes are completely closed, every muscle in my body was flexed holding me down. For the first 2-3 seconds after the first drop I stayed exactly like this. Then I heard it. The music in the back ground. Immediately I felt a rush through me and my eyes burst open! I release my death and throw my hands up with the intense look of a psychopath on my face. I had never put my hands up on roller-coasters (even if I'm not scared I always have a death grip on what ever is securing me). But now my hands up as high as I could get them. I feared nothing. I felt immortal. I felt powerful. As the ride ended and I got off I was still shaking but not from being scared but from the intense power that I felt. My friends all thought the ride was ""awesome"", while I felt it was insane. For the next 2-3 minutes this feeling of ""power"" stayed with me but eventually faded away. For awhile anytime I heard this song I would get an insane adrenaline rush (never as strong as the first time sadly). I don't get nearly as nervous when going on a roller-coaster now because of this.

TLDR; Read it.

Edit: Just realized this is my longest post ever and most likely no one will read it."
