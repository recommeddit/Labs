1556,I've heard of this!! And heard the same - that it was actually very good. Was it spicy at all?
1557,"I don't remember the taste being particularly spicy no. It was some time ago I have to say, but I do remember asking for the recipe.. in vain ;)"
1558,"Olive Oil - the amount of fat gives it a wonderful consistency, and it has an incredible mellow taste."
1559,"I tried making that once, but it didn't turn out well. Basically I just ended up with a cold oily mush. 

Is there some trick to getting it right?"
1560,"I've made it with [this recipe](http://www.theworldwidegourmet.com/recipes/mirabelle-tarts-olive-oil-sammut/) and it was amazing. Granted, it didn't have a ton of oil, but it's one of my favorite ice creams."
1561,I'd eat that.
1562,I made this [maple ice cream](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/maple-ice-cream-recipe.html) for Thanksgiving and it was terrific.
70546,Thanks!
1564,"Favorite weird ones I've made are goat cheese with roasted cherries, and basil with a mint swirl."
1565,"See, those sound lovely. That's the kind of thing my mom wants me to make."
1566,"i got the goat cheese recipie from the Jenni's Splendid Ice Cream book.  I found several of her recipes available on-line, which thoroughly convinced me to buy the book."
1567,Goin' on the wish list. Thanks!
1568,she tested all of her recipes out on regular ice cream machines that normal people like us have.  I have huge respect for that.  I hope you like the book!
1569,"Lol normal people. I'm sure I will, especially if it's held in such high esteem! :)"
1570,"Ginger's my favorite ice cream flavor, but i suppose it must be strange because it's impossible to find. I've only seen it at a few places, and then only briefly. 

I love a nice garlic ice cream as well. I've tried garlic chocolate ice cream and did not like it, but the just garlic with vanilla is a treat.

Red bean and green tea are so common around here now that I don't think they qualify as strange anymore, but I love them."
1571,Where are you from? You're around so many interesting flavors. I love it.
1572,"I'm in the San Francisco bay area (east bay). There's lots of Japanese restaurants around here that serve red bean or green tea ice cream (sometimes with sweet tempura batter, for a take on the baked alaska). The garlic ice cream was from down in Gilroy.

The first time I had ginger ice cream, though, wasn't in this area. It was at Morimoto's in Philly. It was served on a crisp sesame seed cookie and covered with a tea reduction sauce and slivers of baked lemon grass... tastiest desert I've ever had."
1573,You're making my mouth water. You're so lucky to live so near all those wonderful flavors!
1574,"I have yet to go to one of the stranger ice cream places out here. There's one that has candied ginger, which is rather different than just ginger. It has all sorts of strange flavors, though. I'm hoping to get to [Humphry Slocombe](http://www.humphryslocombe.com/Home.html) sometime this month."
1575,Haha woah man - that place looks crazy. I would so go there with you.
1576,You're totally invited. :D
1577,WOOHOO!
1578,"Chili lime.  I used to work at a place that a did a trio of ice cream with that one, dark chocolate, and strawberry peach.  It was awesome."
1579,"Gosh that combo sounds nice. I bet it's pretty refreshing, too."
1581,"I actually tried fois gras ice cream once. Not something I'd what every day, but it was surprisingly tasty. It also had some kind of berry in it - blackberry maybe? But it was so much better than I would've expected :-)"
1582,I have had carrot cake ice cream that was fantastic
1583,It sounds fantastic. I need to make that happen.
1584,I like both basil and cilantro ice cream.
1585,Mmmmmmmcilantro
1586,Avocado Cinnamon
1587,"Scallop.  Only had it the once,but it was scrumptious!  Kind of like a mildly sweet, creamy, seafood soup, but cold and in a cone."
1588,"Orange pepper; strawberry with pink pepper; black sesame; and buttermilk. I've made basil, but I wasn't a huge fan."
1589,"* sweet potato ice cream
* i've also had a scoop of soy powder ice cream filled with [mochi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi) (japanese rice paste), which was also delicious."
1590,"I was thinking of a sweet potato ice cream with some caramel; I'm glad you mentioned it as being good.

Soy powder ice cream. Does that change the consistency at all?"
1591,"surprisingly, the soy powder ice cream didn't have a different consistency than a standard vanilla hard ice cream.  i have not sampled it in soft serve, though.."
1592,"A cooking TV Show here in Denmark, once made a smoked herring ice cream. I wish I could say it came out delicious, but I'm afraid it didn't seem like a big success."
1593,"Iron Chef America folks often times try their hands at turkey ice cream, and such, and the judges *never* like it. Shrug. I'll try anything once. Almost."
1594,i'm a sucker for the avocado milk shakes :)
1595,"I've never had one, but its about to happen. Gettin me some cado this weekend."
1596,the super fat straws you get with bubble tea make them extra special :D
1597,Lol yesss
1598,"There is a Kabab house near us that makes a heavenly Saffron Ice Cream with rosewater. It's a beautoful golden/saffron color, and the smell- at first- smells like strong roses in spring. I remember the first taste was kinda weird, but I wanted a second taste. Then a third, etc. Now it's one of my favorite ice cream flavors- but only from that restaurant."
1599,"Omg saffron! See, I would have never thought of that. Incredible."
1600,cookie dough!
1601,"I am still not a believer in pork floss ice cream (Taiwan) and green mango sorbet with bagoong (Philippines).

But several years ago, I had spicy flavors and am now a convert.  Sugar balances the heat.  

I love strawberry candied jalapeno and thai chili lime (originally inspired from Humphry Slocombe in San Francisco).  Made the former and it's always a surprise hit with everyone."
1602,Parmesan with figs.
1603,That sounds amazing. And I do *not* say amazing often. Oh man... Want...
1604,"Olive and Basil.

Effectively basil flavoured with olive chunks mixed in right at the end. Also added some pine nuts for texture which worked really well. The salty olives + sweet icecream worked quite well together, but keep the olive chunks small if you're going to do this... its kinda gross if they're too big.

I think it'd work quite well with caramel in there, as caramel + salt tends to be a good combo."
1605,"Have also really enjoyed Star Anise ice cream, but don't consider that quite as strange."
1606,Truffle sorbet served along a fried foie gras. O.M.G.
11817,Holy crap
1608,"Blue cheese and honey from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale, AZ"
1609,Oh my....yum
1610,"Not as out there as some others in this thread but we often put a bit of balsamic vinegar in with our strawberry ice cream, it really works."
1611,How much do you put?
1612,1 tbsp - in about 875ml of ice cream
1613,I bet it's just enough to make the other flavors pop. Worth a try!
1614,"Yeah, it's just like putting pepper on raw strawberries, that's really yummy too. Love the theme on the subreddit, btw!"
1615,"Oh man or salt on watermelon? 

Thanks! Still working on the logo and snoo."
1616,"I'm too lazy/tired to type out the recipe but I created a jamon (as in Serrano, as in fancy ham) gelato for a chocolate dessert not too long ago and it actually did really well. Very umami and Parmesan-like at first, then sweet and milky with a distinct chicharron/crackling finish."
1617,I... would really eat that! jamon serrano's awesome. what was your recipe like?
1618,"Much more milk than cream, both to work in the gelato machine and to balance out the extra fat from the ham. Whole eggs, cornstarch. Sliced the ham thinly, infused in the hot milk and cream for about 20 minutes, then hit with an immersion blender for maximum surface area. Strained after I made the custard and added a little scotch in at the end of smokiness. Was amazing with gooey chocolate cake and caramel."
1619,Ooh!
1620,Raspberry white tea ice cream has been a favorite for me in the summer. I can't wait until it gets hot so I can make some!
1621,"A local place does gorgonzola and pear. And earlier this year I tried blood orange, which was amazing. At the same place I also tried ""fig yoghurt,"" which the person behind the counter insisted was definitely ice cream, not frozen yoghurt! Either way it was the best thing I ever tasted.   
 Edit: My favourite flavour of all time is rose. Not sure how strange that really is but I had to throw it in there. Earl Grey ice cream is amazing too. I'll stop now."
1622,I've heard of cheese ones but I haven't found a recipe yet that doesn't have reviews that say it gets too many crystals or bad texture... I'd love to try a good one though.
1623,"I currently make Gorgonzola and ricotta gelati for my menu at work. Both have gorgeous textures. [This](http://cafebacaro.blogspot.com/2012/10/gorgonzola-gelato.html) is the Gorgonzola recipe I've been using, and [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/11/easy-ricotta-gelato-recipe.html) is the ricotta one. They're both on the softer size, smooth, perfectly scoopable with great clarity of flavor. AND they're both super easy!"
1624,"Oh wow thank you!  I absolutely love cheese so the gorgonzola is probably going to be my next endeavor.  I really wanted to do a parm one but I couldn't find a good recipe.  

I am incredibly grateful for these recipes!  Thank you!"
1625,"It's in _Perfect Scoop_, so I suppose it's not that weird, but I really enjoyed the orange-szechuan pepper ice cream."
1626,My mom would eat that hardcore
1627,I recently had cardamom flavored ice cream and it was to die for!!
1628,My favorite unusual combination is a recipe from [Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home](http://www.amazon.com/Jenis-Splendid-Ice-Creams-Home/dp/1579654363/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1398978523&sr=8-8&keywords=ice+cream+recipes): Sweet Corn with Black Raspberries. Sweet and tart and delicious!
1629,That sounds fantastic.  Her recipes get mentioned here a lot.
1630,"I highly recommend her book. The formula is basically foolproof (I had one batch turn out screwy, but I'm pretty sure that's because I scalded the cream)."
1631,Yea I need to invest heavily in her recipes. That corn one sounds great and actually reminds me of a cupcake recipe I came across. Corn meal cake and blue berry. I bet they would be good together.
1632,Fried Chicken http://mrjeffmccarthy.com/2014/03/20/fried-chicken-ice-cream/#comment-4506
1633,Whaaaa
1634,"I'm the head chef of an artisan gelato company.  I've made thousands of custom flavors.  Today I made Corona Lime Sorbetto, Oberon Orange Zest Gelato, and Guinness Espresso Chip Gelato, and that's just the beer flavors."
1635,Would you consider sharing recipes or do you like to keep them private?  Because those sound magnificent.
1636,"My contract doesn't allow me to reveal recipes.  But I recommend starting with your base recipe, and adding more beer than you think you should.  strong IPA's are my favorite.  We also make an oatmeal stout gelato with homemade oatmeal raisin cookie dough."
1637,You're fantastic thank you!
1638,"Yesterday I made artichoke gelato from the baby artichoke petals that were just getting thrown out. It's amazing. Clean, delicate and creamy. And naturally artichoke green! Same base as my jamon recipe without the extra milk, infused with a wee bit of lemon zest and vanilla, and blended in a blender since an immersion would choke (ha) on all the fibers. Half a shot of Cynar to finish."
1639,Holy moly that sounds good
1640,Roasted banana or peaches.  Anything with sea salt.
1641,Oh lord that sounds good
1642,"Just found out about [this ice cream place in 
Brooklyn, Odd Fellow Ice Cream](http://www.oddfellowsnyc.com/flavors.html). They have had a lot of interesting flavors. I'm definitely inspired after seeing some of these."
1643,"Last summer I was playing with a concept for a Jersey sweet corn-white truffle ice cream.  It was right at the end of the season...so this summer, I have pledged to really concentrate on this one...will post up pics when I do...thanks to OP for this amazingly inspirational thread!!! 

I am making a caramel ice cream today...will post it later..."
1644,When you make the sweet corn please please post pics and recipe! I bet it's magnificent!
1645,"Absolutely!!! It took a while, but I discovered I need to use truffle honey...pics real soon!!!!!"
1646,Oyster ice cream...
1647,I want to say ick but that wouldn't be very nice.  How was it?
1648,whaaaa?!?!? Tell me more. I was just thinking about how a briny taste could maybe work if paired with something else.
1649,I made smoked salmon ice cream earlier this week; 'twas damn good imho.
1650,Got a recipe?
1651,"Yeah mon.

2 c cream

1 c milk

1/3 c sugar

1 t fine salt

6 yolks

~2 c smoked salmon (ran through robot coupe)

1. Combine all but yolks, let simmer so sugar dissolves and salmon steeps a bit.  

2. Blend mixture and strain. 

3. Normal custard process from there."
1652,Very cool thanks!
1653,[Here's a pic.](http://imgur.com/AwS7ztY )
1654,Oooh it's a quenelle! Very pretty!
1655,Had ricotta fennel gelato in Italy - ridiculously good
1656,Holy crap I bet that was good
1657,"I make the ice cream for all the family gatherings. MY present to the birthday girl/boy is they get to pick the flavor. No matter what they ask for I will make every effort to make it.

So here is the list as best as I can recall of odd flavors.

* Ballerina, my niece dances (Made bubble gum flavor using icing flavor from target)
* Beef jerky pie (I ripped up beef jerky and made uncooked cookie dough in balls, freeze the balls first, tasted actually not bad)
* Raspberry, cranberry lemonade sherbert (Other niece likes sour)
* Pumpkin pie (Used pie filling, and uncooked cookie dough to add pie crust taste)

So always make new things, as I have learned so much from having to make such weird things."
1658,Raspberry cran lemon sherb sounds delightful. Well they all do. How does the uncooked cookie dough work with the ice cream?
1659,"Im on my mobile so can't really look it up, but look for pregnancy cookie dough. It does not have eggs in it, so you can't cook it to make cookies but it tastes like cookies.

I make mine and then roll them in to 2-3 cm balls. Freeze them on a cookie tray for about an hour at least before dropping them into the ice cream.

Hope that helps."
1660,Cool!  Thanks!
1662,Vanilla- you can flavor with anything
1664,Cookie dough is winning

1683,Pistachio is amazing
1684,"The blood orange cream ice cream that I tried at the tillamook creamery visitors center last summer.  They said that the creamery exclusive flavors would be released to the general public in stores for 2019, and do far that is a lie."
1685,irish car bomb

1688,"Indeed, Vanilla is delicious"

1699,Any as long as it is blue bell
1700,"in terms of comfort food, I would say that cookies and cream."
1701,Butter pecan or coffee
1702,"Anything with malt powder.  
My uncle once took me out and I got a rocky road ice cream malt and suggested I get it with extra malt powder and it was absolutely amazing, and now I wont eat rocky road ice cream unless I have malt powder to put on it."

1715,Phish food by Ben and Jerry's is the best
1716,Homemade vanilla ice cream
1717,Praline. It is kind of like a Nutella flavoured ice cream.
1718,"Vanilla is tops. As it also easily becomes any other flavor. Without it the rest wouldn’t be. But butter pecan, strawberry or peach I would be happy to get over chocolate. Chocolate though if a cheap carton of it will to me taste better than the vanilla from the same brand. Black walnut though was not for me at all."
1719,Salted caramel or strawberrry

1763,Choc mint
1764,Chocolate/Peanut Butter combo
1765,"Nutella, and you put some Nutella in the ice cream so it hardens to the consistency of fudge"
1766,"I Ana a fan of Gino's on Figueroa. The simpler the pizza, the better here. If you can, get a slice of cheese fresh out of their oven."
1767,I'm gonna have to check this place out.
1768,"To be honest, I don't rate it. I'm not a local, but was staying at the Canary, so Gino's was close by. The pizza was nice, but nothing special, the price was fine too."
1769,"Second vote for Gino's, best pizza in town by far. Super cheap too. 
Uncle Rocco's (on state) is also good, a bit more expensive but they have $3 draft fig mountain so there's that"
1770,Easily Paesano's on San Andres in the westside
1771,I always forget about Paesano's! That place is really good.
1772,"Olio pizzeria's magherita DOC, no contest. 

It's not cheap, but if you want the best, it's the best."
1773,How are their portion size?  Enough for two?
1774,Too soggy IMO!  Delicious ingredients though.
1775,That's fair. The secret is to ask for them to make it a little crispier :-)
1776,"Via Vai in upper village montecito has several Italian pizzas I crave on their menu, and if it's delivery obviously Rusty's is the sb staple"
1777,Pizza Guru has some amazing atypical pizzas (goat cheese w/ pesto and buffalo chicken) and do gluten free. I'm more of a simple pizza person in general but the Peaceful Pesto there is amazing and figured they deserved a shout out.
1778,Patxi's on State is really good. It's a deep dish Chicago style pizza. It's pretty pricey but the slices are very filling and they give you fresh honey to put on the crust.
1779,"I have to ask having lived near Chicago, is this a legit Chicago style? Not just a thick crust with toppings but rather a vessel of cheese and toppings with sauce on the top? Gino's east or Giordano's style."
1780,Actual Chicago Style. [Here is a photo of their pizza.](https://patxispizza.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signature.jpg)
1781,Sweet mother Mary! Actual Chicago style in SB?! Thank you!
1782,"I'd call it *almost* Chicago style. It's about half as thick as you could get in Chicago. Still though, very good pizza."
1783,I've been here twice since moving to SB. A few things that have put me off was the 45 min cooking time and the price.
1784,"In fairness, the 45 minutes is the time to bake the deep dish so it tastes good and fresh.

I was going to recommend it as well but you've visited already.  I can't really think of any other places.  

I hear a lot about Olio though.  Haven't been there myself, but I think I'll plan a trip soon."
1785,"Oh god is it worth it though. You can get 2 shitty pizzas from Dominos for $17 delivered in 18 minutes, or an amazing, authentic, and filling deep dish from Paxti's for $28 delivered in an hour."
1786,You can call ahead. . .  They asked if we did that when we went for lunch.
1787,RIP Nardones...heard they closed yesterday. :(
1788,Mesa Pizza.
1789,"Taffy's is the best, especially for families"
1790,Nicky D's on De La Vina by a long shot. Im always amazed more people dont know about it!
1791,For a quick slice of something decent stop at a Rusty's.
1792,Giovannis on upper state. I've been going there since I was a kid. Favorite pizza place on the Central Coast.
1793,"I second this, Gios on upper state is the best in town and the one in Isla Vista isn't bad either"
1794,Gino's on figueroa
1795,This is my favorite. Also best lunch deal
1796,There's a wonderful place on Milpas right next to McDonalds
1798,"Amazing comment, have an upvote :)"
1799,"Lol, I just moved here and have a running list of places to eat. 

I added Cesarito's a few days ago, but I couldn't find it, kept driving around and around. I'm glad you mentioned it being next to McDonald's otherwise I wouldn't have found this hidden gem."
1800,Wait do you mean little ceasears??
1801,Isn’t that the one that is haunted?  Or is that just your pride that haunts you for going to that one?
1802,Hahaha wow 🤣 Your comment totally made me realize what the first initial comment was
1803,In all seriousness Mesa pizza is our goto
1804,Marty’s on De La Vina is a hidden gem!! They do takeout only I think but have THE BEST classic flavorful pizza
1805,I second this! Definitely my favorite pizza in SB.
1806,"Santa Barbara Woodfire Catering out in Goleta at Captain Fatty's Brewery. Their Margarita is super good.

Olio's Pizzeria is good. The Umbra is wonderful.

And Gino's on Figueroa is classic."
1807,Little Caesars on Milpas
1808,I enjoy the white lobster calzone they have here.
1809,Didn't know they had that? Always go for the cheese pizza and crazy bread. I'm a simple guy
1810,Isn’t this where pizza goes to die?
1811,How dare you sir/madam
1812,Ikr? Jokes aside I actually love Little Caesars
1813,Revolver Pizza on San Andreas is a new place. Heard nothing but good reviews. And the place that it used to be Paesano’s was my favorite in town. So if there is any remnant of Paesano’s there it’s gotta be good.
1814,Revolver & Noemi are both two great new places.
1815,Noemi? Never heard of it.
1816,Just opened where pizza guru used to be on upper State. Roman style pizza. Legit.
1817,Up by Vices and Spices? Sounds good. I’ll have to try it
1818,"Exactly the spot. I think I prefer Revolver, but was very impressed w/ what we got there last night. https://www.noemipizza.com"
1819,"Revolver has the best damn pies this side of the freeway, and probably the other side, too."
1820,"I don’t understand the love for Rusty’s. Nostalgia? Having only tried it as an adult I think it’s objectively terrible pizza. 

I usually make the drive to Toppers."
1821,"Rusty’s is great if you know what to order. Go pan pizza, get all the awesome toppings, and you can’t go wrong. I would also recommend *not* getting the small. For whatever reason, I’ve found personal, medium, and large to be beyond excellent, but the small is just weak. 
\"
1822,"Thin crust, large pepperoni with extra cheese and 3 sides of ranch. This is the go to order for Rustys for me. It tastes like high school ."
1823,"I haven’t had the pleasure of visiting Santa Barbara recently given the ongoing apocalypse, but for me it’s definitely nostalgia. It was the place to hang out for the SBCC Computer Club in the ‘80s. Fun times. And yes, I’m an old geek."
1824,Rusty's is not great but the main selling point for me is the online ordering and fast delivery. Bettina is legitimately good pizza (and IMHO the best in the area) but you have to order IRL and then drive down to get it... 😞
1825,People actually like Bettina? It’s so bad!
1826,you are trying too hard... 🥱
1827,"Olio on Victoria st across from the public market. Make sure to go to the pizzeria and not Olio Limone the fancy restaurant in the front.
Lucky Penny pizza in the funk zone
Via Vai in montecito 
Petrini’s and Giovanni’s in San Rocque
And you can’t go wrong with 805-564-1111, order extra ranch."
1828,Ginos!
1829,Unique Pizza - Noemi’s - very good
1830,"Woodstocks in IV on Mondays is B1GI large and extra large, so you can get 2 huge quality pizza's for $20 or so. No better deal. They have a good tangy sauce that they roll into the crust which I quite like.

Rusty's is probably my fave though."
1831,REVOLVERRRR
1832,just finished my pie from there!
1833,Woodstock’s in IV is my husbands favorite
1834,"It's expensive, but it's great."
1835,"If you are looking for a solid, California pizza, go to Rusty's.

If you want a delicious New York style slice, the only option is Lilsy Wood Fire Pizza. I say this as a former New Yorker."
1836,"I concur. I ran into Nick (former owner) in the dog park several years ago. We ended up chatting for a while bc our dogs got along. He is a very NY Italian man. When he told me he had a pizza place in town, that was all I needed to know. A little expensive but definitely the only NY pizza here."
1837,I’m team Rusty’s (granted haven’t tried much else) but love the pan with Hawaiian toppings.
1838,"I was going to recommend Lilsy’s too, great stuff."
1839,"Olio Pizzeria  is fantastic Neapolitan style pizza.

1840,Never been to Roundtable (sorry) but my favs in town are Giovanni’s on Upper State followed by Rusty’s thin crust. Woodstocks is good if you like a lot of sauce and variety of pizzas. Heard good things about PizzaMan Dan’s in Carp.
1841,"If you haven't been to PizzaMan Dan's, don't bother. Absolute garbage."
1842,Haha but he has a cool car. I hear it's just a Rusty's rip off anyways
1843,It’s my understanding that pizza man dans and toppers were both offshoots of rusty’s
1844,My favorite is Rusty's. Pizza My Heart in Isla Vista is also good.
1845,"The correct answer is Woodstock's. Honorable mentions Giovanni's and Taffy's. If you want to each the pizza that most of us eat on the regular, then Rusty's"
1846,Rustys
1847,"I can't believe no one has suggested Marty's Pizza.  I have only had their combo (or special; the one with all the stuff on it, whatever it's called), with pineapple instead of ground beef.  Nothing else compares.  There is a bit of inconsistency, but even on their less than stellar days, it's better than any delivered pizza I've had.  The crust is thin, which I like, but isn't for everyone.  It's not cheap, but worth it."
1848,Gino's. Turkey panini is also fire.
1849,"Persona Pizzeria on State Street.

1850,Back in sanjose my favorite place to go was round table but it seems they don't have a location here. What places would you guys recomend that is anything like roundtable?
1851,Rusty’s is reasonably similar to Round Table. But there are many better spots like Bettina and Olio Pizzeria.
1852,Especially their pan cooked pizza reminds me a lot of Round Table.
1853,"R / SantaBarbara in every Covid thread:
""Stupid tourists!
""Stay  home!
""Let us get our numbers down! "" 

But if they want pizza...."
1854,I'm actually here with my girlfriend for fall classes. So I guess I'm just half tourist lol. We're staying with her mom who lives here.
1855,"Taffy’s for that style. My new favorite is Revolver pizza, on San Andreas. The closest to NY style I’ve found."
1856,"Giovanni's on upper state street.

 3020 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93105

It's our favorite :)"
1857,Un Petite Ceasars on Milpas.
1858,"Try out Bettina, its more pricy and upscale but quality pizza"
1859,Rustys is a SB staple. Highly recommend.
1860,Born and raised in Sb...never had taffy’s 😫
1861,"Olio's Pizzeria is really good. There is a new pizzeria that opened on the west-side, only makes a certain number of pizzas a day, so have to get there early, called [Revolver](https://www.independent.com/2020/08/24/revolver-brings-new-york-pizza-to-the-santa-barbaras-westside/)

I usually make my own, better than what you get in SB."
1862,Go to Rusty's or the two on the Mesa (I forget their names)
1863,I love Petrini’s pizza also they have the best Italian sandwiches. Capicola is to die for.
1864,"Santa Barbara is where pizza comes to die. Its all just a hot mess and meh. There is a reason Santa Barbara has no Michelin Stars.

Case in point, the number of people telling you to go to little ceasers. WTActualF?"
1865,Are you dissing Le Petit Cesar?
1866,"Yeah, it’s because Michelin doesn’t publish a guide for SB lol"
1867,"They dont huh? Hmmm, you sure about that?

1868,It's well known that no one comes to St. Babs for the food.  Tourists are only here for the hangover.
1869,"My backyard coal oven, but I’m not open to the public."
1870,Round Table is so good. Rusty's isn't ;(  No recommendation. All of our pizza is pretty gross here. Had to comment because I just can't let the Round Table comparison go unchecked!
1871,Honor Bar got some good pizza
1872,"Have you tried Bettina over in Montecito? One of the owners, Brendan Smith came from Roberta's in Brooklyn."
