23242,IMO Assetto Corsa is better
23243,so many free mods out there for it too
23244,Well you just opened a rabbit hole for me...
23245,"it gets ridiculous.  the amount of tracks is amazing.  tons of touge track, whole seasons of F1, there's even offroad rally mods last I saw.  it's pretty awesome but some stuff will be buggy as well, such is the world of free mods."
23247,assetto corsa touristenfahrten server ftw!
23248,"Dirt Rally is really fun with a wheel/pedal setup, and not too hard to get into like some of the more hardcore sims can be."
23249,"Interesting, I love most track racing sims but found Dirt Rally to be one of the most difficult, punishing racing games I've played. I've never played any racing game with a wheel setup though, just controllers, so that could be the difference."
23250,"Dirt Rally is much more sim-esque than the other Dirt games. Depends what you like, but it's certainly more difficult and I found it harder than a lot of other sim style games too. I do like that they left the Gymkhana shit out of the game though, I'm sick of that crap."
23251,It's really tough with a controller.
23252,"If you prefer arcade racing and some simulation:

* Forza Horizon 3

If you prefer sim racing:

* Assetto Corsa
* iRacing
* rFactor 2
* Project Cars

There are other racing sims and games out there, but I'd say those are the most widely popular and recognized."
23253,I've been playing slot of the dirt series games and it's fun as hell. Dirt 2/3. And then there's grid is more arcade but the grid series is slamming. But yeah I own all the games he posted and there fun as hell but I'm def a dirt and project card driver.
23254,"Forgot about dirt, that's a good series.

Super fun."
23255,"DiRT 2 is fun* 

DiRT 3 was the one with all the impossible gymkhana shit that you could never get gold medals in. It drove my OCD up the fucking wall"
23256,"[I'm sorry, what?](http://i.imgur.com/3z34GCV.jpg)"
23257,I appear to be a pleb
23258,"[They're only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7QnhSkr43U) [as hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crliwCw6UB0) [as you make them out to be.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwoxeB7iAo)

~~Potato quality because 7 years old computer. Sorry.~~"
23259,"Add Forza Motorsport: Apex to this list and by September or so, Forza Motorsport 7."
23260,what would the difference between sim and only racing be? sim games you build the cars and customize etc?
23261,I'd say Sim is way more realistic. e.g. in P-Cars you can get into suspension and tire pressure settings for specific tracks/races/etc. Arcade is more just boot up and go.
23262,ok thanks for the explanation.
23263,You really should have a wheel for sims. It's very incentivized.
23264,"I see, I think I am going to go for Forza as I don't have a wheel or a lot of time. Plus the graphics look great!"
23265,What graphics card do you have?
23266,1070
23267,"Sim games are typically as faithful to real life as possible. They have a high skill ceiling and are much more difficult to be fast and toy suffer the consequences of physics. Sometimes you can tune or customize cars but not to the extent you think.

Arcade racers are usually focused on racing in their own sense and don't try to replicate real life past you being in a car. Forza mixes the two pretty well and customization is great. 

Honestly, if you're just getting into racing forza is a good choice."
23268,"Sim games (project cars, assetto corsa, rfactor) you can customise things like suspensions, tire pressure, camber, sway bars, things that affect the driving but nothing but like engine swaps or cosmetic stuff.

Forza is what you want for that"
23269,Sim games require more of a commitment. I find I don't jump into sims for a quick race compared to arcade racers.
23270,I wish sim games let you customize stuff.  Stock cars are boring.
23271,"it's more to do with the game physics, arcade style games are designed to be not frustrating for people with no real-life fast driving experience and are designed to be totally playable with a gamepad. Car handling is usually greatly simplified, using the brake is often optional other than for hairpin bends, it's hard to go into a spin unless you screw up.

Sim games are designed from the ground up to have as reallistic physics as possible and to be played with a steering wheel, pedals and shifter. They are much more unforgiving, like real life, so it's easy to lose control of the car and going fast takes a lot of skill and practice. For many people it's too frustrating and they don't find it fun."
23272,yah I think Im gonna go for forza horizon because I dont have any intention of doing a wheel setup.
23273,"Rubber band effect is an important distinction. In many ""arcade racers"" the rubber banding is serious. Meaning if you end up trailing, the competing cars' AI slows down on purpose. Where if you take a heavy lead the AI actively becomes more competitive. (Think Mario Kart)

I'm not heavy into pure sim racers, but I'd assume there would be less, or no rubber banding at all. In real life a lead is a lead after all.

P.S. in edition to Asseto Corsa and the Forza games, Need for Speed Shift is one of the best non-underground Need for Speed games, which is much closer to Forza style arcade/sim balance."
23274,"I would throw Automobilista on there as well. It's very similar to rFactor 2 if I remember correctly, and it has a lot of mods."
23275,"I mainly play Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 although the loading screens are a bit long and therefor for car games I stick to BeamNG , which I completely recommend. The game started out in 2012 although since then it's came a long way. The game is a realistic car crash simulator although you can free roam, do made up scenarios, 4x4, do a $1000 car challenge and much more. Atleast look into it :)"
23276,I reccomend beam.ng to anyone but it does take a powerful computer to run it decently
23277,I really like Forza Horizon 3. Great looking game and runs pretty smoothly for me. But it's a pretty demanding game so you'll need a decent rig to run it well.
23278,"id love a game with good graphics. thats half the reason i play battlefield, because it lets me use the kickass card I bought. Do you think forza has the best?"
23279,"Yeah I'd say Forza has the best graphics out of all PC racing games. But, I think Project CARS is a close second."
23280,"It certainly has the graphics down. I'm not sure if it's the best, but I consider my rig (r9 290) fairly high end and I can't get into the higher settings."
23281,what CPU?
23282,A 4690k
23283,"Odd, have you tried adjusting the graphics settings like AA and shadows? Those always going to be huge performance hogs. 

turning off shadows and moving to a lesser AA would probably give you better results. 

Start at one of the lower presets and turn things up and see what happens. 

I have a 980Ti with a 4790k so I can get a solid 60fps at 1080p with adjusting some settings that I don't care for, but most are maxed"
23284,Ahh I'm on 1440p. That's the difference.
23285,"that's why. a 290 is not a strong enough GPU for 1440p without lowering presets to low. My 980Ti cant even run this game at 1080p with all settings maxed. 

Guess its a GPU heavy game. I may try 1440p and turn down AA and such and see what happens"
23286,The trade-off is worth it. 1440p is stunning.
23287,"Meh, not to me unless its on an ultra-wide."
23288,+1 for Horizon being the best-looking racing title. It's also probably the best all-around option in general as there's something for fans of every type of racing here. Except maybe NASCAR? Fuck NASCAR though.
23289,"Have a wheel+pedals? Assetto Corsa

No wheel+pedals? Forza Horizon 3"
23290,Eurotruck simulator 2017
23291,It's actually a pretty fun game if you like to have something to do while you listen to your music collection. The truck physics are also first rate.
23292,"Rocket League is technically motorsport, right?"
23293,"Rocket League has cars, Rocket League is the best PC game, therefore Rocket League is the best PC car game."
23294,"Piggybacking on your comment to leave a link for the [World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctTMQTmBbi4) trailer. If you're not familiar with Rocket League, it's worth the watch to see if it's a game that would interest you."
23295,"If you like to build cars - Street Legal Racing and My Summer Car.
If you want to just race - Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Forza Horizon 3"
23296,"+1 on Street Legal Racing Redline. Honestly, it's not something you could really call a 'good game' - buggy as hell, singleplayer is lacking, physics are.. not great (though usable, feels like they lack some refinement more than anything). But the amount of ways you can build a car, especially with a few mods, I'm pretty confident in saying 'has never been matched since'. Decent soft-body physics for a game this old too.

For anyone curious, it's somewhat back in development and is available on Steam. Other than that, GOM-team has previous versions for free, which are the ones that most mods are meant for (no idea how the Steam version handles mods really). The *""SLRRMWM2011 - The Compilation STAGE1""* is a good one to start out with IMO, coming preinstalled with a couple mods, fixes and extra tracks (like the Nordschleife for example)."
23297,Wow I had no idea people played street legal racing still. That game was my childhood and is what got me into cars.
23298,"Hell, I'd be surprised too. The game survived 15 years basically through mods alone. Steamspy tells me there's around 40000 who bought the v2.3.1, which is way more than I imagined (though not a huge number by Steam standards)."
23299,My summer car if you have too much free time and want to hate yourself for building a car and dying immediately.
23300,My summer car is so awesome.  I gotta play it again since they updated.
23301,I play Project: Cars
23302,Project cars is a little too arcadey to some but I really like it. It's one of the better games for getting together with friends to race online without needing a crazy amount of experience to make the racing fun.
23303,"I don't really understand how people find Project Cars to be arcady. Maybe they're comparing it to Assetto Corsa, but AC's ""realism"" seems to be based on giving every car so bad mechanical grip it's like driving with slicks on a freshly oiled tarmac. 

Shitty physics =/= realism imo."
23304,BeamNg.Drive is pretty fun.
23305,"Definately my favorite crash em up car in 2017, plus modding support means you can get just about any car put into the game, not only cars even: anything with wheels.

Another close contender is Wreckfest: Bugbear's next car game."
23306,GRID is my favorite. Just avoid GRID 2 though because its hot garbage.
23307,"GRID: Autosport is better, though still not so great

Edit: better than 2, not better overall"
23308,"You know, I like Autosport but for some reason my cars gearbox would always get damaged for no reason. It became problematic in later races when I simply couldn't keep up with the AI because my shifts were too slow"
23309,"Huh, didn't even know it did that. Pretty shitty thing to happen"
23310,Test Drive!
23312,yah the simracing stuff does look really cool. probably something to look into when Im in my 20s and have money haha I could probably set up something pretty cool.
23313,Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.
23314,"- Arcade racer: Trackmania, Forza Horizon 3

- Simulator: Assetto Corsa, rFactor

- Tycoon: Automation (car company tycoon game)

- Not recommended: GTA V. Has terrible driving physics and customization is expensive."
23316,Cars actually had weight to them in GTA4 and the shitty cars that smoked and broke down were hilarious. On V you can just fall on your roof and straighten the car on the spot...
23317,"I haven't liked the driving in any GTA game I've played, which includes III, VC, and V."
23318,"i played gta on my xbox when my friends did. good fun game to dick around on, but not a car game true."
23319,"Funny thing is, GTA actually has a decent car community. People have learned the ins and outs of the engine and can do some pretty rad stuff. Mods are also cool"
23320,"I absolutely love GTAV racing. Me and a bunch of pals regularly do 6+ player racing. For something that's not the main point of a game, it's really good!"
23321,"I can't tolerate GTA racing because the physics are just so terrible. They might be fun if you just do jumps and stuff, but I'd much rather play Forza if I wanted to race."
23322,The Hot Wheels pack for FH3 completely killed off the last bit of my interest in ever going back for GTA racing.
23323,"I haven't played FH3 in a while, but i'm really tempted to get back into it because of the Hot Wheels expansion. It just looks like a blast to play."
23324,I wouldn't recommend Automation yet unless they've fixed all of the bugs and made the campaign a bit more interesting
23325,"Assetto Corsa for road racing and Dirt Rally for, well, rallying. In VR of course."
23326,"If you don't have a wheel I'd cross AC and iRacing off the list. Forza Horizon 3 is fun, has a bunch of cars and you can play with Xbox players."
23327,"Forza Horizon 3 - More arcadey, fun for collecting and customising tons of cars and doing crazy builds.

Assetto Corsa - Pretty realistic sim but not too full on - Tones of easy to install mods for more cars and tracks which i recommend checking out

rfactor 2 - If you want a really realistic sim to test your driving skills

Project Cars - Not as realistic as Assetto corsa and rfactor but more of a sim racer with more polish and better graphics and a good career more

Dirt Rally - Only realistic Rally game worth owning IMO"
23328,A related question if anyone has ever played Midtown Madness.. do any of these newer games have a cops and robbers mode? It's basically capture the flag with cars. It was an excellent way to kill time and I've been trying to find a new game that offers that play-mode for years.
23329,My Summer Car
23330,"Raceroom. Its free, has amazing graphics, and it runs really well on an old pc."
23331,"PC?

**Screamer**.

There have been more technically advanced games, games with better physics, games that look better but has there been one as mind-numbingly as stupidly fun? No."
23332,"Grid 2 is pretty fun, also extremely aggravating. The best part is even an old crappy computer can run it just fine with the graphics still looking good."
23333,"My Summer Car, if it counts."
23334,"Forz Horizon 3, it looks amazing graphically on PC and has good content.  Good mix of simulation and arcade racing, with a lot of cars and online features."
23335,"iRacing is brilliant, but pretty expensive. If you're looking for something less expensive, Assetto Corsa is just as good."
23336,"iRacing it term of physics details 

Project Cars lacks a bit in physics comapred to iRracing but graphics are astonishing

Asseta Corsa is like mid world. 

And buy yourself a steering wheel"
23337,"For something arcade like: Forza Horizon 3, Grid, NFS. For something that like a simulation: Project cars, Assetto Corsa, iRacing. If you want to customize a car, there is Car Mechanic Simulator"
23338,"Follow up question, how are any of these games with an Xbox controller aside from Forza?"
23339,"Last car game I bought for PC is Need for Speed: Carbon, still worth playing it and its predecessor Most Wanted if you have never done so. Another arcade car game is Test Drive Unlimited, which has a huge map, if you're​ into that (there's even a race around it, which IIRC takes about an hour to complete!)."
23340,My preference is project cars but the new version comes out later this year with 12k support and 180 cars.
23341,"For gearheads: Automation: the car company tycoon game

http://store.steampowered.com/app/293760/Automation__The_Car_Company_Tycoon_Game/"
23342,http://store.steampowered.com/app/516750/My_Summer_Car/
23343,Forza Horizon 3.
23344,"Forza Motorsport 6 and Forza Horizon 3 for just plan run, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars for simulation

You can download Forza 6: Apex for free. Its the F2P - gutted version of Forza 6 and it should be able to let you get a feel for how the game is and it runs really well IMO.

You'll have to get Forza through the Windows App store though. Apex is PC only, Forza 6 through the App Store has an Xbox Only version, and a ""Play Anywhere"" version where you play on PC and Xbone. Get the Play Anywhere version."
23345,"For simulation, Dirt Rally and Asetto Corsa haven't really been beaten yet.
For arcade, I actually really enjoyed the 2016 Need for Speed game. It got a lot of ridicule for its console release lacking manual transmission, but the PC release has that, along with 4k and 144hz support. It's a fun arcade racer with arcade physics and a shit ton of upgrades you can do to your car. I'm running a 1000hp aventador with drift tires right now lmao. I also heard that Forza Horizon 3 is pretty good, but they don't support my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) because of the logo on the front."
23346,rFactor if you want to be [Dagumi](https://webmshare.com/WWQo1)
23347,"BeamNG.drive is fun to mess around in. DiRT Rally and DiRT 4 (haven't played 4,but they're similar, apparently) are great fun for rallying fans. For general racing, Assetto Corsa and rFactor are my favourites. For something more simcade-ish, Grid Autosport was fun. The Crew is nice if you want to roadtrip with your friends, too. 

And if you're willing to mess with some (many) crashes and conflicting mods, Street Legal Racing Redline is awesome. Building your own car from individual parts is great. And it's got loads of mods. 
A less crash-prone alternative is My Summer Car, which is a rural Finland simulator."
23349,"> was the best and is still the best in terms of physics.

lol.  Looks like you need some research time in /r/simracing."
23350,Postal 2
23351,"What a sad day it is when the Gran Turismo series doesn't even get mentioned as a good car game. I've owned every one in the series and bought all the PS consoles just for the title, other than PS4. Oh how the mighty have fallen. 

BTW, I play Project Cars and love it. Don't play it often anymore, but man its a good game. It's even better if you have a good home audio system!"
23353,"Lol I play them on the same home theater setup, so I sometimes forget which system I'm using."
23354,You can't tell the difference between a Play Station and a PC?
23355,"If you tried iRacing with a wheel and then played Gran Turismo, you would laugh that they call it ""The Real Driving Simulator"""
23356,I don't doubt that. Going from GT to Project Cars with my racing wheel and chair setup was a massive difference in racing experience. Even just having to get used to warming up my tires in PC's was a big step up in realism. Hopefully the next version of Gran Turismo lives up to it's name.
23357,"Yeah I used to love Gran Turismo 2-4, fucking loved that shit.  They are stuck because it's a console game sold to kids.  It's just going to continue to shit out the same iterations because it's what the people want. 

It's been too long for them to change.  It's like giving Madden a complete overhaul, not gonna happen as long as it keeps selling."
23358,"This is my type of question! From someone with a modest racing wheel setup (Thrustmaster TX Pro, Pro Pedals, Shifter), as well as an Elite Controller, here's what I have played. 

Forza Horizon Series - all 4 titles are great open world racing. Definitely not simulation, but not full arcade either. All other titles I will compare to these, as handling and car control are very neutral. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Forza Motorsport series - 6 and 7 are very deep, a bit more difficult to control than Horizon, but just as fun. Many real and fantasy tracks, lots of cars, and lots of career progression. Graphics are great too. Online is fun, but as it's on GamePass, lots of new people. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Dirt 4 and 5 - rally inspired, same sort of feel as Horizon setup, but more casual. Cara are very floaty, a bit more arcade based. Cannot tune vehicles either. Tracks only, not open world. Car selection is lower, as is tracks. Fun game. Feels like they are trying harder to be ""young"", but to me feels a bit hollow. 4 is in GamePass. 5 is not. 4 is wheel supported, t is not yet. 

Dirt Rally / 2.0 - similar to Dirt series, but more sim. Cars handle more heavy, and are thus much harder to control. Most races are point to point as real rally is. Small car selection, but very entertaining. Worth it if you enjoy time trials, and rally racing. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Project cars 1 and 2 - more sim based than Forza. 1 is decent, 2 is a serious upgrade. Less cars than Forza 7, but more real tracks. Lots of cool career progression. Racing series have warm ups, time trials, qualifying, races, pitting, race strategies, etc. AI is very good in this too. Control of cars with controller is not easy off the start, but there are HUGE customization choices, with lots of settings available online to make the cars feel heavier, and more like other, easier racing games. Online is good, wheels are heavily supported.

Project Cars 3 - newest PC game, feels like s step back from PC2, smaller game, less cars, worse graphics. Feels like as if Dirt series were on tracks. Structure feels very much like a mobile game. Weird progression. Wheel supported, though not very good. 

Grid (2019) and others - this is another arcadey type series, sort of a cross between Project Cars 2, Forza Motorsport 7, Dirt 4 and 5. Very cool career progression, good car selection, though not as large as PC2 or FM7. Cars feel light and quick, racing is very fast and very high energy. Tracks are real world and lots of Fantasy. Online isn't that great, but career mode in this is massively diverse, many types of cars. Wheels are supported well here as well. 

Assetto Corsa - more sim than most of the others. PC2 and Forza Similar, though car control is probably the most real, and most frustrating with a controller. Easy to change settings to find something that works, but controls must be very smooth. Lots of track selection, lots of cars. Lots of tuning. Online is good, though not massive population. This game on PC is one of the go tos with mods and add-ons, but on console leaves a bit to be desired. Very comparable to Gran Turismo series on PlayStation. Wheel supported very well.

Assetto Corsa Competizione - a GT based titled from AC. Small amount of cars. Good track selection. Controls like AC, very very very sim based. Hard to control with a controller unless you are very very experienced. Online is great, but very league based. Great wheel support. 

Need For Speed series - Heat is Newest. Similar feel to Horizon, open world. Lots to do, day and night racing. Lots of car customization. The most if visual mods are your thing. Car control is very arcade like. Very quick. But easy to tune, and definitely fun to play. Online is good. Wheel support isn't very strong. On GamePass

Need for speed Hot Pursuit Remastered - a 2010 game, redone. Very fun. Time leaderboards setup. Sense of speed is unreal. Lots of wrecks and crazy crashes. You play as street racers, as well as cops. Takedowns and crashes are lots of fun. Not a huge car selection, but online cops and robbers is solid cross play stuff. Pretty cheap title too. 

F1 Series - good F1 racing. Obviously f1 cars, and F1 event tracks. Sense of speed is good, if you love F1 racing you'll probably really love the game. Good career mode. Very much a simulation of the F1 series. Wheel supported. On game pass.  Very good online. 

Nascar series - same as F1 notes, only Nascar based. A bit more arcade feeling than F1, but everything else applies the same. Wheel supported. On GamePass I believe. Very good online.

Wreckfest - very arcade, very fun demolition derby type crashes and races. Very good physics. Online is tons of fun if you like crashing. Can be found at good prices too. 

Hotshot racing - 90s style 16/32 bit racing. Super fast super fun. On GamePass. You gotta give it a go. 

Burnout Paradise Remastered - same group of people that went on to do Hot Pursuit Remastered. This is ultimate arcade high speed, crashing fun. Open world. Very crash based. Extremely good sense of speed. Car selection is not great, all are made up cars, but based on real life ones. 

My most played titles with a controller are Forza Horizon, Forza Motorsport, Grid 2019, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered, Wreckfest, Burnout. 

My most played with a wheel are Project Cars 2, Assetto Corsa, Forza 7.

This is not all, but a good base of what available. Anything that might interest you, I would encourage you to hop on YouTube and do a bit of quick video watching to see if it floats your boat before you buy. If it's on GamePass, just download and give it a try. 

YouTube and channels that have good racing game content are FailRace, Jimmy Broadbent, Stevio 2175, Slap Train, Super GT, Yorkie065, Chris Davis, Don Joewon Song.

If you have any questions about something specific, ask away. In more than willing to give you deeper perspective! I hope this helps out more than just you!"
23359,"> Dirt 4 and 5 - Cannot tune vehicles either.

You sure? I tried giving Dirt 4 a go a couple of weeks back and there seemed to a pretty intricate set of tuning options. Pretty much identical to what I saw in Horizon 3."
23360,"You're right! In 4 you can, in 5 you cannot. I forgot that was one of the things they took away going into 5."
23361,"Might be really late for this but thank you for this great list, you did what like other 10 threads failed to do."
23362,"Hey! No problem! I am glad that someone took something from the list! If i can help other gamers find games they enjoy, thats all that matters!"
23363,"This. Dirt Rally 2 is great, though you are more in for the long... run.. he..he.... .."
23364,Thank you for such an articulate preview of each racing IP. Very helpful :)
23365,"You don't like pc3 with a wheel? I have a thrustmaster tx. I have pc2, I know pc3 is a sin to pcars fans, but I don't care if it's not sim like pc2 was. But if it's shitty on the wheel, then I don't even want to bother."
23366,"It was ok, but PC2 was miles better. PC3 shouldn't even really share the same name as PC2, it's so drastically different. 

On a wheel, it just feels like an arcade game. And not a great one."
23367,On a wheel how is it compared to grid and forza horizon? Because both of those are enjoyable on a wheel for me (although they play better as controller games imo). But if it's like a NFS game...I ..I can't. Oh God.
23368,its most similar to Grid 2019 i would say. not near as bad as NFS.
23369,Got any cool scifi racers like wipeout?
23370,"I've heard good things of the dirt series, its a rally racer."
23371,Yeah I hear dirt 5 is good  I'm about to get it this week
23372,"I finished it, it's a great blast from the past if you enjoyed the old ones."
23373,I really like dirt 5. Straight up fun arcade type racing. The environmental effects are insane.
23374,F1 2020 by Codemasters.
23375,"Agreed but its definitely more ""sim"" than horizon which can turn some people off"
23376,It's still pretty aracdey compared to the more serious sim racing games (with a good amount of assists to tweak to your liking). But it has one of the best and most fleshed out campaign modes out of all the racing games.
23377,Burnout Paradise Remastered. It’s available on EA Play 👍
23378,Thanks friend
23379,I loved the OG and didn’t even know this existed. Thank you!!
23380,Yeah. So much available on Game Pass and EA Play that it’s easy to miss gems 💎
23381,Can you still get into online games on this?
23382,I have this game but can't get it to run for the life of me. I launches shows the intro video then immediately closes.
23383,Wreckfest. Great combo of fluid physics with arcade demolition derby no holds barred fun.
23384,If you don't mind going a bit retro - Midnight Club: LA is backwards compatible
23385,You made me remember I actually have this game somewhere at home thanks :)
23386,This game is great and the graphics still hold up.
23387,Dirt 4 is on game pass if you want to try the license.
23388,"If you're interested in something simpler and more arcadey, I'd recommend Hotshot Racing on Game Pass. It's an indie game and it's going for a PS1-esque polygonal aesthetic, looks really good IMO. Pretty fun game, not super deep but it's got some satisfying drifting and it runs beautifully smooth."
23389,Hmm. Interesting. Thanks for the suggestion.
23390,Grid. 2019 release. Often goes on sale for 10$ or less I believe .
23391,assetto corsa competizione is by far the best racing sim available for console and runs beautifully on next gen
23392,"This looks amazing (not played), I don't understand why it's not talked about at all, assumed it was a bit rubbish... hence I've not played it."
23393,Forza Motorsport?
23394,"Project Cars 2. It has loads of content and is One X enhanced as well so it looks quite nice. It caters to both, fans of arcade-style racing and gamers looking to get into sim-racing. If you're curious about what sim-racing is all about, Assetto Corsa is available on game pass!"
23395,I'd say Assetto Corsa Competizione if you want the full sim experience.
23396,"Is this any good? I only bought my Series S literally for Forza Motorsport/ Horizon and the State of Decay games (PS5 is my main console)... but got Game Pass for £1 so I’m looking to try some of the Game Pass games. 

I mean it’s free so I may as well try it, but if it’s a steaming pile of shite then I’ll not bother to even download it. Does it work okay on game pad? I know it’s predominantly a PC game so."
23397,"The game that’s on game pass is asseto corsa. It is a simulator with good selection of cars and tracks. It’s good on Xbox but it is best played on pc with all the mods and add one, assetto corsa is a different game on pc. Try it since it is on game pass but don’t expect too much. 

Assetto corsa competizione is a official SRO Org licensed game which focuses on GT3 racing. All cars with base game are GT3 class cars and there is dlc for GT4(slower) cars. It is mainly for sprint and endurance racing if you are into it. It looks better than ac(built on UE) has better UI and has became the king of GT3 racing game for console. But it is just GT3 and GT4(dlc) racing. 
 
I do a lot of sim racing and have a good sim rig setup and acc has been a really good racing sim."
23398,"The simulation and physics, not to mention audio, are so good that you'll have a hard time playing other ""sims"" like Forza Motorsport again, if you're looking for a proper sim experience that is.

That said, I'd only play it with a wheel. People do play with controllers but ultimately, it really was designed around a sim experience and thus designed primarily for wheels."
23399,Need for Speed Heat is great fun (it's on EA Play!)
23400,is it still in 30 fps ?
23401,"Forza Horizon 3, The Crew 2, NFS HP Remastered, Hotshot Racing, and Forza Motorsport  6.

FH3 is FH4 but better imo. Less replayability than FH4 since the lack of series but it has an active multiplayer and is very fun.

The Crew 2 is similar to FH4 b it has planes, boats, and cars, and the summit which is similar to a series usually features cars rather than planes, something which is preferred by most people who play racing games. It is almost a mix of FH4 in terms of gameplay and NFS Heat in terms of driving mechanics and customization. Lots of replayability and lots of fun.

NFS HP Remastered is a great game in terms of gameplay. Not much replayability, no storyline, or any car customization. People get this game because of the racing itself and not much else. Multiplayer is fun but I find the career to be more entertaining.

Hotshot racing is a simple arcade style game. Worth a try if you have GP. It’s like NFS HP R in terms of gameplay, no story but very fun events.

FM6 is better than FM7 imo. The game feels more smooth and organized and the progression is *somewhat* better than FM7 (FM7 gives you a Mclaren F1 right off the start). Definitely a good mix between sim and arcade."
23402,"One that I never really see mentioned is the Crew 2, it gets a bit of flack but it’s actually a really fun open world game. Huge map of the entire USA, and they keep adding more content all the time. Has all sorts of racing from street racing to rally, off road, formula 1, demo derby and even boat racing and planes. I think there’s about 16 disciplines all up. Worth checking out you can probably pick it up pretty cheap on sale. I’ve been playing it on and off since finishing all the achievements in Forza Horizon 4."
23403,Garfield Kart Racing
23404,Project Cars
23405,Crash Team Racing if you like things like Mario Kart.
23406,"Dirt 5 is really fun, F1 2020 also"
23407,Project Cars 2 if you want something motorsport focused.
23408,Dirt 5 after the patches runs like a dream on series x. Crazy visuals with all the weathers and lgihting effects. If yoir tv had good hdr the lighting is crazy bright
23409,Any of the main line Dirt series if you want a racing game with a more arcade feel. Dirt Rally if you want to be challenged. World Rally Championship or WRC are also fun. A nice balance of realism and arcade-like controls. F1 series is great and honestly I was shocked how much I liked Need for Speed Heat.
23410,Grid 2.
23411,Dirt4. And Forza 7.
23412,"Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Horizon 2, of course. I’m not trying to be a smartass, but if you’re new with 4 and love it, you’ll still love those ones."
23413,"Dirt 4 is great and it's on Game Pass 

OnRush isn't exactly a racing game (more of a demolition derby kind of thing) but it's on sale frequently and a ton of fun."
23414,"Forza Horizon 2 - that is the best racing game on xbox one.  I loved it, much more engaging than 3 and 4 because it is more about racing and the scenery is awesome.

Not sure why this isnt' on gamepass.  It was free a few years back w/ games with gold."
23415,"> Not sure why this isnt' on gamepass

Because Forza games, up to this point (I wonder if FH4 will be different since it actually launched on Game Pass), get delisted 4 years after release. So if you don't already own it, only way to play it now is find a disc copy somewhere."
23416,Daytona USA is a classic. Team Sonic Racing and Racing Transformed are both quality titles. I have been playing Dirt 5 which is a lot of fun. Horizon 4 has spoilt us though!
23417,I like NFS Heat because you can switch between day/night to do different stuff.
23418,The Tony Stewart games are fun
23419,Forza Motorsport. Lol. Seriously I've been playing NFS games and they suck now. Maybe Dirt. I heard good things about it.
23420,"Forza Horizon 😁😁.

On a serious note, dirt maybe"
23421,"Need For Speed: Underground 2 gives you an amazing sense of progression and customization.
You start out with a choice between incredibly basic set of cars, which you can keep upgrading or you can buy a newer, better car then upgrade. Repeat the loop until endgame."
23422,Was gonna say this aswell + riders of the storms
23423,Into this house we're born..
23424,Into this world we're thrown…
23425,... Like a dog without a bone....
23426,An actor out alone
23427,Riders on the storm
23428,There's a killer on the road
23429,His brain is squirming like a toad
23430,I loved that soundtrack. Spent hundreds of hours playing that with my kids back in the day anf it had a major impact on my sons taste of music. Eventually got a projection set up and I used to just cruise around for hours. And I was constantly impressed at how they managed to make each car feel so different.
23431,I remember the first game I played the entire thing in the miata you start with
23432,"Did the same as a kid, turns out you can basically max the specs on the starter miata so it's as good or better than anything else you get later in the game."
23433,The AI cars are always set to match yours in Underground so you can genuinely play in the starter car and your opponents don't get harder
23434,"Now, I don't know about OP, but I know I don't like that in a progression-based racing game."
23435,Same. At least without it being a setting choice or something. Ruins the whole experience if my Miata can beat supercars. Or if everybody is driving Miata level cars even to the endgame.
23436,I'm guessing you haven't seen many v8 swapped miatas?
23437,"I'll tell you man, I threw my hat into a discussion I probably shouldn't be in, regarding cars. I don't know much about cars. I know what a Miata is, and I know what a Koenigsegg is, and I'm pretty sure they don't belong in the same category, but maybe I'm wrong. 

That said, I feel like I should mention that that is...quite the username you have there."
23438,"Fun fact: Founder of Koenigsegg, Christian von Koenigsegg, owned a Miata and says its ""purity"" influenced his brand.

Source: [https://carbuzz.com/news/theres-a-little-mazda-miata-in-every-koenigsegg-made](https://carbuzz.com/news/theres-a-little-mazda-miata-in-every-koenigsegg-made)"
23439,"That actually *is* very interesting, and I thank you for telling me."
23440,Discussions like this are why I sub to r/pcgaming and ignore r/gaming
23441,"This is what killed racing games for me. 

I used to love them. 

It doesn’t matter anymore if you are good or bad at the game. The AI will always adjust to be just slightly worse than you."
23442,For those confused as to what a Miata is it's an MX-5 for the rest of the world.
23443,"When I see ""Miata"" I imagine the car looking something like Fiat Punto."
23444,"That's my favorite car!
I almost finished the game with it, but I've had enough of 'Miata Tornados' (fancy term of when I crash and just spin two seconds in the air), so I bought another car lol"
23445,Beat that game in a Peugeot 206. Felt so good.
23446,*angry Jeremy Clarkson noises*
23447,"Bought a Peugeot 206 RC a couple years ago, much thanks to me playing with it in NFSU2 as a kid. Lovely car, so much fun to drive."
23448,"I don't think I'll ever have the experience of playing NFSU again.

The first one in a crappy computer, later the second NFSU on a PS2.

Such a great and fun experience, exploring the city, getting better parts, better cars. I never was a car guy so I just went ""this one is more expensive so its better"" but I had a blast making cool cars and the sense of progression was awesome.

I'd pay to have the old NFSU2 as a remake but unfortunately we're stuck with shitty lootboxes from EA."
23449,"I think NFS2 gets into my category of 'Games that I want to experience for the first time again'. I marvel at driving down the city, finding new shops to upgrade my old but reliable Miata...

There's just this feeling you get as a kid, you know?"
23450,"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition was also very rewarding with the progression. Man do I miss those games, now progression has been replaced by monetization."
23451,"I miss my Mazda MX5.

Why is it so fucking hard for EA to take NFS U2 and just make a revamp with the same mechanics, same upgrade choices, same customization etc, make modern graphics and charge a set price, and not have it packed with MTXs?

I mean seriously, it's fucking ridiculous.

That would be the best selling NFS since Underground 2, almost no doubt, because the original IS just so good."
23452,"Even if it was best selling, which it would be, mtx brings them in so much more money. And there is your answer why, money."
23453,"Have you heard about [Night-Runners?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA0utA4kKow) Super excited for the demo to be coming out in May.  


While not exactly a U2 spiritual successor, it may be what you are looking for."
23454,"That clip gives me Tokyo Xtreme Racer vibes. Definitely going to have to keep an eye on this game, thanks!"
23456,Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero is still my favorite racing game of all time.
23457,"Because you cannot make shiny and bombastic ads out of a Peugeot 106 (or its modern equivalent of an Up/Polo). 

And many people will eat up whatever shit their are thrown at anyway."
23458,"\> Why is it so fucking hard for EA to take NFS U2 and just make a revamp with the same mechanics, same upgrade choices, same customization etc, make modern graphics and charge a set price, and not have it packed with MTXs?

&#x200B;

Not worth the money investment, duh. Besides, i doubt anyone at EA still has original engine of the game and i have my doubts it will do nicely with modern graphics with just an asset swap."
23459,"I've never been into cars, nor racing games, but I LOVED NSF Underground 1 and 2 when I was a kid. With modern gfx I would love to play it through again!"
23460,"while i dont disagree, i dont think the old ""celebrated"" nfs games aged well at all. if you want a modern nfs game, nfs heat is perfectly fine imo"
23461,"If we're talking about the game engine, graphics and whatnot, I can see your point. But if we considering the sheer bewonderment and nostalgia also how it was ahead of its time, the game deserves to be called memorable, at the very least. 

I haven't checked out NFS Heat though. I'm guessing it's the one with the cops?"
23462,"Its quite a cool mechanic to be honest, it has a day mode where you earn money in legal street races, and a night mode when you earn ""heat"" (read: exp).

You need heat to unlock parts and cars, and you need money to buy them so you have to play both modes to progress. I'm enjoying it, the story mode is cringe acting (Miami Vice springs to mind) but in a fun cheesy way."
23463,"I play racing titles very occasionally, always have, but when NFSU:2 came out there was a solid three month period when I played almost nothing else. It was legitimately far ahead of its time and I imagine among the PS2/OG Xbox era it'll have aged pretty decently compared to most titles from that time."
23464,It *is* very much ahead of its time. There's no racing game that matches NFS2 in my heart. Even now.
23465,You all should join r/NFSU2. Let's make it active again.
23466,Cant recommend this more. One of the best racing games out there.
23467,"Can't agree with you more.
I don't usually like racing games, but NFS 2 holds a special place in my heart. The customization and exploration is amazing and one of a kind!"
23468,Just imagine a remake remaster of nfs underground 2 with actual video sequences.
23469,"Underground 1 and 2 (and Fuel, but that's different story) were the only racing games I enjoyed and completed, as someone who generally never touches any sports/racing games."
23470,"NFS Heat kinda fits OP's description as well, however I can't personally recommend it due to my experience with poor performance and crashing. I know people who have enjoyed it without those issues so ymmv lol"
23471,"I miss the old Gran Turismo games that did this. Crappy car, drive those amateur league races, buying a used car which was a limited selection deal, so you ended up with a car you might not usually go for that you eventually ended up loving. 

Racing games these days just shower you with cars and money, killing all sense of meaningful progression. Then you have to artificially limit yourself which always feels like complete shit."
23472,I loved playing Gran turismo as a kid. They managed to make little boy me get excited for a racing game even though I never really had any interest in the genre. So fun to drive your way up to whatever favorite car you had at the time (Dodge Viper btw!).
23473,"I remember having the hardest time with the super license as a kid in GT2, there was a small circle track with a viper that was almost impossible not to spin out."
23474,"GT2. Viper. Laguna Seca for the professional licence. Beat 1.22.00

Over 300 attempts. 

When I finally beat it, I carefully saved the game, copied the save file onto another memory socket, then danced around the living room for 20 minutes. Top of the world ma! Top of the world. 

I was 29"
23475,Mitsubishi GTO!
23476,"My point exactly! There's no climb, no progression, just pandering. I recently tried Forza Motorsport 7 and i straight up had a supercar from the beginning, even though i couldn't drive it, it was so weird."
23477,"I always loved taking my complete crap car and throwing all the money you could at it, and it was completely useless but so much fun."
23478,"100%. The old GT A Spec was such a good game. I remember there were two games out at the time, A Spec and Concept. A Spec was such a superior game."
23479,A spec was one of the best games of the 2000s
23480,Yeah the concept game was basically a large demo for the GT4 engine.
23481,"Yeah, I used to love to play driving games.. but basically when I get my first supercar that's ""finished the game"" for me, so all the newer driving games are like an hour long. Once I have something that goes 200mph there's nowhere left to go. 

And trying to wrestle some piece of crap like a Chrysler Sebring with a turbo slapped on it around corners is the best part, anyway, unless it's getting some upgraded suspension parts and new tires on it so wrestling it around those corners becomes a bit easier.

If I want to drive a futuristic rocketship I'll go play F-Zero GX again."
23482,I briefly played Forza 2 back on the 360 and that reminded me a lot of Gran Turismo where you have to buy cars for specific leagues. Sadly Forza 3 did away with that.
23483,"I remember Forza 3 having pretty good progression. It was the game that hooked me into the series, tho I don't play them anymore. I found the same problem as OP with Forza 7."
23484,"As far as I remember Forza motorsport 4 is where that ended, after that they started coming out with horizon and it all went to shit. I think the reasoning was that it was getting too expensive to license every cool car every and open world games were the new hot ticket so it all shifted that way and imo for the worse. I got Forza Horizon, barely played it and hated it, returned and never came back to Forza. It's too bad because the racing wheel support and force feedback for FM3 was cutting edge for consoles at the time and I really hoped they were going to keep pushing that direction."
23485,GT4 for the PS2 was the last one i remember like that.
23486,"GT5 was also pretty similar, even though perhaps the progression from shitty car to racing car was a bit faster."
23487,Gran Turismo was amazing. It was so addictive. I remember that feeling of *desperately* wanting to earn my way to the actual racing cars.
23488,"I loved grand turismo, started with a mazda miata i think and at the end game getting the escudo pike peak version, i worked so hard as a kid to get that goofy looking car, it was so fast though, totally worth it."
23489,"just dusted off my old Ps2 and playing GT3 for this exact reason. Brake and corner tests to get a license. $15k on a mazda mx5, 4 beginner races to get enough $ for an exhaust upgrade to give me 12hp more.. I'm on my way.."
23490,Wreckfest is the closest game to that from my experience.
23491,I can't recommended Wreckfest more. It's a great one.
23492,In Wreckfest you start with a good car and turn it into a crappy one.
23493,"Wreckfest is a hidden gem. I really wish it got more play, it's a fantastic racer.

The damage physics are sooooooooooooooooooo satisfying."
23495,"The progression is so weird in Wreckfest, the first two tournament tiers are the most difficult because the AI is a much better driver in a slow vehicle than it is in a fast one. Even if you kit your C-class whatever out to have a higher rating than everyone else on the track, it's still a restart scum fest sometimes because they hit the ideal line perfectly with zero wheel slip and catching up to that if you're behind or damaged is nearly impossible. Meanwhile the same AI in an A-class vehicle will wreck out and disqualify on lap 4 of 6 nearly every time because they can't stop flying into guardrails."
23496,"Midnight club LA. It’s so sick, shame rockstar didn’t continue with it"
23497,"Ohmygod Midnight Club was amazing! I spent so many hours playing that, and making my own maps, it was so glorious."
23498,Yeah totally. Had a good selection of cars too and the car mods were decent also. Great game
23499,"Midnight Club was the shit back in the day, I really miss those games"
23500,I can't find anything to replace my midnight club 3 fix.
23501,Anyone played Midnight Club II? I loved that one as well
23502,MIDNIGHT CLUB FOREVER! What an amazing experience!
23503,I really liked Dub edition. It was like the only game I had on the original Xbox that used the custom soundtrack feature.
23504,And The music was amazing on that game! it really was ahead of its time
23505,"The old Forzas were so much better about this, but now you get a new free supercar every couple of races."
23506,"Thats not even the issue I have with Forzas, its the fact that there is no progression due to the immense 'level' scaling. Doesnt matter what car you have or what upgrades you buy for it, since your opponents magically get all the same stuff.

After I realized that, I lost all interest in Forza Horizon 4. 5 will probably be the same bullshit.

I remember in NFS: Underground 2 if you progressed to quickly you soon found out you were racing against too fast cars compared to yours. Then you grind a few races, get that big turbo and go back and be competitive. It felt good, thats how it should be.

In Forza new cars or upgrades are meaningless, because you dont see any difference. Also the focus on supercars and hypercars gets pretty boring. They lose all their appeal once the whole game is about them."
23507,"> I remember in NFS: Underground 2 if you progressed to quickly you soon found out you were racing against too fast cars compared to yours. Then you grind a few races, get that big turbo and go back and be competitive. It felt good, thats how it should be.

The problem is that the inverse wasn't true. You could be rolling in a max upgraded car, and some AI in a stock Civic will be always 2 seconds behind you. The rubber-banding in that game was atrocious. You'd see that Civic crash then a few seconds later, it would be going 450 mph in full ""swiggity-swooty, your racing line is now my property"" mode."
23508,"Agreed, rubber banding is cancer too. I was a kid when I played NFSU2 so its possible I didnt notice rubber banding that much"
23509,"Yeah, I didn't notice it at the time either. I went back to it for a little nostalgia trip, and it is horrendous. Also, there are hundreds of invisible corners which would flip our your car randomly. I don't know how I didn't notice any of these problems at the time."
23510,"The difficulty progression in recent Forzas works differently: You start driving at ""novice"" difficulty and as you get better in the game, you are supposed to increase it and get bonus credits. That's really it. FH4 is even weirder, you don't even have to win races, you just need to finish them."
23511,"Yeah it was fun but the fun wore off quickly.  There was no apparent advantage to upgrading cars, as it was evident everyone did the same things to theirs, and you're given too much too fast.  It was car overload.  I had to build in my own set of goals in my mind, and that bugged me since I felt like I shouldn't have to.  Horizon 2 was the last good one, in my opinion.  Played like a racing RPG"
23512,"Upgrading to the top of a class makes a huge difference though. A a720 vs a a800 isnt a fair fight.

That said, I hate doing a rally level in my custom tuned rally car, only to get passed by a fucking lambo with road tires on mud... They artificially make the cars the same, but it's NOT just the performance index system, they are doing something else to give them an advantage, but I'm not sure what exactly it is.

They already do plenty you can't see, like stats for anti-squat and other adjustments we can't change. Not hard to imagine they change other stuff so the races stay fair.

That said, it would be stupid if you were able to turn a Ferrari into a rally car, then faced street only supercars in mud. It would be like racing 3 classes above them."
23513,In Forza 7 you can save the replay and check the AI driver's telemetry. They are rubber banding by magically increasing torque and horsepower on the straights.
23514,"AHHHHHHH

I LOATH that telemetry doesn't work when watching replays in Horizon 4."
23515,"Yeah i just got F4 recently and noticed this, however ive still been able to have some fun in the game just by driving and im treating it more as a collectathon now, trying to get all the cars."
23516,"Also my problem with Forza Motorsport 7. I've been playing them since Forza Motorsport 2, and one of the things I *loved* was upgrading an unlikely car like a Mini or a Ford Fiesta, and setting them against much better cars like Ferraris or Lambos.

But in FM7 reviewers praised the ~~""Homogenisation""~~ ""homologation"" which basically meant you always got cars exactly the right spec to compete. Which might sound good on the surface, but it basically means every race is the same, just a different speed."
23517,"I think the issue is that the majority of reviewers see playing games only as a job, so a game that's easier to progress through is ""better"" because it takes less time to complete.  
In the meantime, I dropped FM7 after 1 hour for the same reason as you."
23518,"Homologation rules in FM7 means you can’t actually “build” a crazy car and go race. 

I remember in Forza 3 or 4... swapping in a Ford 5.0L modular motor (before the coyote engines) into a Ford Focus, making it AWD, and giving it like 1000hp. Good god that car was silly. In forza 7, you swap in some upgraded brake lines and a clutch, you increase class and break homologation rules and can’t run the car. Hell, some cars even need to be downgraded to play. I still haven’t finished the main career because it got so boring I just keep going back to Horizon so I can just fuck around with cars. 

Homologation and class rules are not bad; having them for a few races would be cool but having them for the whole game is dog shit."
23519,">	But in FM7 reviewers praised the ""Homogenisation"" which basically meant you always got cars exactly the right spec to compete. Which might sound good on the surface, but it basically means every race is the same, just a different speed.

This is probably why I’m finding getting through FM7 such a slog."
23520,"Homologation not homogenisation but yeah. It makes sense in practice since it's what real race events are like (every car has the same engine, etc) but it's only fun if you want that ""the only thing that sets me apart from my competition is my driving skill"" sort of vibe. If you want the more street racing, all the cars are different vibe, then it's definitely not the game for you."
23521,"Are you sure that Underground 2 doesn't have level scaling? Because Underground 1 does. I used to have trouble beating the later races. One advice on the internet that worked was to remove every upgrade you can, and the other cars will also be slower, making the game easier.

Also, I bought the Corolla GTS as my starter car in Underground 2. It's the worst car in the game, and the first few races, all my opponents were using the Corolla GTS until I got enough money to buy a bunch of performance parts. 

When I finally upgraded from the Corolla to the Mazda RX-7, which is a pretty big upgrade, everyone I raced with seemed to be using much better cars as well."
23522,"Its possible my memories arent accurate, I played it as a kid. But for some reason I do remember that the upgrades were meaningful and you could have easier time if you made your car faster. Especially in drag races"
23523,I still play FM3 on my Xbox 360. Such a good racing game.
23524,Man I remember the old Gran Turismo games and doing a race a bunch of times to buy new cars.
23525,"Exactly, it was amazing."
23526,"Oh man, I miss the OG Gran Turismo. you had just enough to buy a shitbox car and start racing."
23527,"My Summer Car! It's not entirely a racing game, and even though you start with a crap car... You're stuck with a crap car. You can get better parts for it though.

Dirt Rally championship mode comes to my mind. You have to buy your vehicle, and you get money from rallying, so start with the 70's car and climb your way from there."
23528,"I came looking for someone mentioning My Summer Car :D

The game is insane - you put together your car's engine bit by bit, let alone the rest of it! If you don't know where every part in an internal combustion engine goes, then you need to download a guide. 

I would really love it if it was in VR, mind."
23529,"My Summer Car VR could be fantastic, oh my"
23530,"Oh no, just imagine the green car hitting you at 200 km/h in VR!
Saatana!"
23531,"Don't forget about the deranged townsfolk or potentially driving your cousin to suicide. Thst game is fucked up, and I love it"
23532,The beauty of this game is making something competitive out of a pile of crap. It also happens to out mechanic the mechanic simulators. It really is a special experience and I wish there were more games that captured this experience.
23533,Voi vittu saatana!
23534,"I was hoping someone would bring this up, it's strange and weird but at the same time weirdly exactly what you're asking."
23535,"OP making me nostalgic for a genre of racing game i never knew i missed so much.

Real oof."
23536,"The curse of Oldschool ""we wont hand you anything"" games is real."
23537,"F1 2020 career mode.
Make your own team or choose Williams guaranteed ""start with a crap"" feeling"
23538,*distant George Russel screams*
23540,Thank you for starting my morning off with a nice chuckle.
23541,"Second this. The progression is exactly what OP is looking for. If you play on the right difficulty levels and are a decently good racer, then you'll probably finish middle of the pack for most of your races. And slowly but surely you'll get more upgrades and get better at the game, and that first podium finish will feel extremely good."
23542,"I like it because there's multiple levels of progression as well.  


First couple races? Keep ABS on and traction control high. Starting to get that under your belt? Turn off ABS and turn TCS down, turn simulation damage on.  


Starting to get the hang of that? Turn on manual transmission. All the while, if you're finishing far ahead of where you want to be, you can turn the AI racers up or down. All the youtubers play with AI at 110%. I've been gradually turning the AI up and I'm at the point where if I'm racing absolutely perfectly I can just about stay close to Mercedes.  


Make some money and get some upgrades in your car, or save up some cash and buy a better power unit for the next season.  


You can also go as deep as you want tuning for individual tracks and stuff - so you can set it up for either ""I just wanna zone out and have a tough race that I can definitely win"" or ""I really want the feeling of being in the middle of the pack fighting for points."""
23543,Love F1 2020
23544,"Codemasters does this a bit. The Gird and Dirt games (at least the older ones, haven’t played the newest ones) start you out in older, less powerful cars and you race in more amateur-type racing leagues.

Then you buy better class cars and can compete on more advanced leagues.

In the original Grid you also have your own race team, and you attract sponsors as you level up, which lets you edit your livery & it gives you additional objectives for bonus cash.

There’s a similar system in Dirt 4, and you hire different engineers and mechanics too."
23545,"Can confirm Dirt Rally 2.0 career mode is like this. Excellent game too, easily my favorite and the most intense racing game I've ever played. Even if you got a faster car at the start, good luck driving it. Not an easy game, you genuinely feel like you're fighting the car and the road with every bump, bend and turn. Palms are sweaty just thinking about it"
23546,"Need For Speed Most Wanted/Carbon/Underground. Pretty old game YES, but to my knowledge we never got better after those.

EDIT: Had many reply, thanks guys ! I will take a look at NFS Heat, but I want to point out at people who still play the old NFS to use VSR/DSR (Virtual Super Resolution AMD GPU/ Dynamic Super Resolution NVIDIA GPU).

VSR/DSR will make your GPU render the game at higher resolution (2K/4k/6k), then downscale to your screen resolution. This will improve the look of the game, sharpness with low impact on your GPU. (deactivate all Anti Aliasing when using this)"
23547,The newer NFS Heat does a decent job at it too
23548,"It runs horribly on PC for some people - I have it from EA Play on Steam and couldn’t get consistently above 30, never-mind 60, on any settings.
(RTX 2060 Super, Ryzen 5 3600 (6 cores at 3.5GHz))

Edit: why am I being downvoted when I’m saying that the game is badly optimised?

Edit 2: clarification - it runs badly for some people and fine for others, seems to be random luck. To everyone saying it’s only me, it definitely isn’t, as a Google search would show you."
23549,"It seems to be somewhat random. Aside from random stuttering the first 30 seconds (alongside audio latency glitching), it ran absolutely fine on my much older rig - GTX 1070/i5 6600k. It might like higher clocks or something, I don't know. But non-dice Frostbite games seem to always have issues with stuttering for a random amount of people playing. I remember playing Jedi Fallen Order very smoothly the first time, but now that I reinstalled it a month ago it's a stuttery mess - I haven't changed any hardware since.

It might be a good try to install any newer game on SSD, devs seem to be caring less and less about HDD streaming on PC"
