37263,Cedar Point is more popular in Michigan than Michigan’s Adventure
37264,That could be because Detroit is closer to Cedar Point than Michigan's Adventure.
37265,It’s about half way depending on what part of Detroit. I live in the east side suburbs and it’s a little over 2 hours to either park.
37266,"No, cedar point’s just MiAdventure, but better"
37267,"It's not even close. Michigan's adventure best coaster is as good as some of cedar points worst rides, like gemini.

It's worth riding Michigan's Adventure wooden coaster solely because of the airtime, but the rest of the park is basically nothing."
37268,"Can’t believe you’re calling Gemini one of Cedar Point’s worst rides. Gemini is my #2 overall and I would sacrifice every ride in that park sans Magnum to keep it. Let the burning of Steel Vengeance commence ;P

...in all seriousness I love love *love* Gemini and I will be devastated when it’s removed"
37269,"I went back and forth on what word to use. ""Lowesr rank by popularity?"" Lol. 

I actually love the helix at the end of Gemini and wish it was used more often. It's the perfect amount of force imo"
37270,These two parks aren't even close to comparable...
37271,I agree but to the GP they may not care nearly as much as an enthusiast. The price is also lower for Michigan’s Adventure but people still spend more to go to Cedar Point.
37272,alaska and knotts berry farm is...interesting
37273,"Probably due to the residents there wanting to go to SoCal on vacation, and then they consider Knott's Berry Farm as a stop. Knott's does pop up on a lot of SoCal itineraries."
37274,"KD over BGW... I find that hard to believe.  Also, BGT in Florida?  Does that exclude IOA, Universal, and Disney?"
37275,Yes. The map excludes Disney and Universal parks.
37276,"KD has had a more a consistent popularity lead over BGW in google search topics, but BGW has been gaining on KD as of recent."
37277,"I find it hard to believe Knott's is #1 for California. Even excluding Disney, there's still MM."
37278,"Well, Knott's appeals more to families than does Magic Mountain, and it's located very close to Disneyland as well. Magic Mountain is not as popular because it appeals to thrill seekers more and it's located on the outskirts of Los Angeles."
37279,"Knott’s just feels more accessible. MM is a chore to traverse, and covers a lot of ground."
37280,MM is still superior. I'll die on that hill. Second best coaster line up in the states.
37281,Nah I totally agree. I like it better as well. Just thinking from a general population standpoint
37282,"That's fair. It's still probably close. MM loves flying out that sweet sweet ""Most Coasters in the Country"" tagline."
37283,"> ~~Second~~ best coaster line up in the states.  

Fixed it for you."
37284,Better than Cedar Point?
37285,I prefer SFMM barely. Cedar Point is a very close 2nd but I really like X2 and Tatsu and I also feel like the bottom end of the lineup at SFMM is stronger. Steel Vengeance and Maverick are both fantastic rides but there was a dropoff after that for me. Carowinds and Six Flags Great America are both close as well. Those 4 parks all have great coaster lineups.
37286,"And it is close to Disney, which is probably why it is searched in those states."
37287,I traveled to California earlier this year and explicitly chose Knott's over Magic Mountain.
37288,KD over BGW? I'm surprised. That....doesn't check out for the areas of VA that I've lived in.
37289,"Yeah it's strange. In the metro area surrounding BGW, BGW is the clear favorite, but in other areas of Virginia ppl searching on Google prefer KD."
37290,"They're kind of like Aldi and Lidl, KD and BGW respectively. Quantity and quality, heavily competing with one another, similar in a lot of ways, one more consciously local in taste, one more consciously cosmopolitan and appealing to the European aesthetic. KD sells a lot of camo stuff and Aldi has a lot of Live Laugh Love-style décor and stuff in the Aisle of Shame that competes directly with MLM junk. BGW is literally a fake Europe theme park and Lidl's best-selling items are the craft beer, the croissants and the escargot. Red counties, blue counties. Red park, blue park.

Rollercoaster junkie, two season passes, bleeding violet and thinking this adopted state of mine is pretty dang sweet n'at."
37291,Probably a heavy DC/NoVa bias which is heavy on KD and considers BGW as like a fun treat
37292,"I mean I live in Alexandria, I can't get to BGW without passing directly by KD. It doesn't surprise me that much. Basically everyone in Virginia either lives closer to KD or lives a similar distance from either park. 

I prefer BGW by a considerable margin but if we're talking ease of travel, KD is the winner by far."
37293,Portland seems like an untapped market.
37294,Tough climate. It’s never really bone chillingly cold here or anything but 8-9 months of persistent drizzle limits the prime operation season to like June-Sept/October. I’m also not sure how it would fare as everyone is out on the trails/coast/mountains while the weather is nice. I’d love to see a larger park here than what we’ve got but I doubt we will ever see it. If there was a market for it I bet it would have been built by this point.
37295,"I can’t believe more indoor parks aren’t being built in the Northwest - Portland or Seattle, or other cities. Something like the recently opened Nick Universe from NJ would do well there, and would not have much year-round competition."
37296,Yeah I agree. Honestly New Jersey seemed like the worst place to build that park. There are a thousand other things to do in NYC even when the weather is bad.
37297,"The NYC metro area is huge. Population isn't the problem with that park, it's the value proposition, the requirement that you need a ticket to enter the park, and paid parking. I'll give you that NYC isn't lacking in things to do (or places to shop, since it's in a mall after all), but I don't think the place is tailored to tourists as much.

Even for competition, a lot of your audience can find a better value for money with Six Flags (more rides for an older audience). Coney Island and the shore piers are popular, and don't require a ticket to walk around with your kids. Hersheypark pulls a lot from the suburbs looking for weekend getaways. Legoland NY is opening next year and aimed right in the same demographic space, too."
37298,"It's rough out here in the Northwest, where I've lived my whole life. The only good park is Silverwood (no offense to Wild Waves and Oaks, but the former is primarily a water park and the latter is tiny), and I've never lived closer than 3 hours away from it, and am currently about 7 hrs away (I'm actually closer to Lagoon here at 5 hrs). Really wish I could have a ""home park"" to pop into a few times a month (or more) like a lot of you guys here have."
37299,"I grew up twenty miles from Kings Island and as a kid I assumed everyone had a park like that close to home. I realized later how lucky I was. I had opening day rides on Flight of Fear and Son of Beast, I doubt I'd even be an enthusiast if it weren't for living so close"
37301,This is slander against Desert Storm and its [wonky loop](https://i.redd.it/ois60vukqndz.jpg) and I won’t stand for it!
37302,Haha so true. I’ve been to castles and coasters and when I saw it I thought to myself “that’s sad...”
37303,"After double-checking, BGW actually has a slight edge over KD currently."
37304,Hahaha Alaska and Hawaii so jealous.
37305,How did you determine most popular - the highest average index over the 5 year period?
37306,"Yes. I compared 5-year average indexes of major parks in each state, and recorded the ones with the highest index."
37307,"Yeah that’s interesting because you could only look at 5 parks for each state unless you normalize based on one of them which is annoying. I wonder if there are any cases where a park outside the region would beat the 5 closest parks? Probably not, but it would be interesting to think about plotting all parks for each state to see if anything changes"
37308,Did you use them as just search terms or pick the “amusement park” label for all of them? I’m having issues with Great Escape bc it’s showing no volume in Vermont when I select it as an amusement park. Santa’s Village seems the most searched in Vermont
37309,"I used them as search topics. For example, if someone searched ""closest amusement park,"" the theme park that pops up on Google results would be considered a search topic.

That being said, I did forget to include Santa's Village in Vermont, and it is the most frequently occuring theme park search topic in that state, so you are correct. I actually have no idea how I got Great Escape, as even SFNE is slightly more popular in VT too."
37310,Yeah Valley fair!
37311,Right? I was surprised by that and Silverwood.
37312,"Well the Dakotas don't really have any amusement parks. I didn't count the waterpark rumored to get a raptor.

Silverwood isn't really a surprise either. The closest amusement park to Montana residents is Silverwood. Washington was more of a surprise. Wild Waves theme park is supposed to represent the Seattle area, but outside of that area an overwhelming number of online Google searches prefer silverwood, so overall more searches in Washington lean towards Silverwood."
37313,"I guess I'd say it was a surprise to me because I didn't realize it was quite so popular up there, but it makes sense because both Valleyfair and Silverwood are in relative park deserts."
37314,"It makes sense for Washington, considering Spokane is around 45 minutes away from Silverwood. Idaho is pretty interesting. The CDA area is obviously searched more for Silverwood, but Boise is pretty split. SE Idaho which includes Pocatello and Idaho Falls areas is definitely Lagoon considering it’s like 3 hours away"
37315,"I've only been to three of these (canobie, lake compounce, sfne)"
37317,"So tons of parks claim 3 states, but none claim more than 3?  


Knotts  
Silverwood  
Valleyfair  
Kings Island  
Hersheypark"
37318,Correct.
37319,"This excludes universal and Disney, what is the breakdown based on the 4 resorts for the 50 states; are there many states that prefer universal (especially Hollywood) to Disney"
37320,I'd have to check that out.
37321,Hard to believe Knott’s gets more attention than SFMM
37322,It appeals more to families and it's located near Disneyland.
37323,"That’s fair, you really gotta like coasters to enjoy SFMM, but it is my favorite park I’ve been to"
37324,Definitely better for enthusiasts but not as broad of an appeal as Knotts.
37325,"Still shocked to see that knotts is more popular than SFMM and Seaworld in San Diego, not sure if this includes zoos as the San Diego Zoo is pretty damn popular around the world"
37326,Zoos were not included.
37328,Disney and Universal not included.
37329,Disney and Universal parks were excluded.
37330,Shout out to Silverwood for being the only available park within a reasonable driving distance for 3 states. Boulder Beach is actually a pretty damn great waterpark
37331,Most Washingtonians live closer to wild waves...but it's wild waves.
37332,Never heard of it. I guess Washington is pretending they haven't either
37333,Knotts has a very far reach apparently...
37335,Disney and Universal parks not included.
37336,"wow interesting, can you do one of these for europe or japan?"
37337,"*Wow interesting,*

*Can you do one of these for*

*Europe or japan?*

37338,Maybe
37339,"Wow - in Texas, Six Flags Fiesta Texas wins out over Six Flags Over Texas."
37340,It's very close between those 2 and SSA.
37341,"This gives more weight to my ""Have Cedar Fair buy Mt Olympus and turn it into a regular park (with a large waterpark and a ton of hotel rooms)"" idea."
37342,Mississippi would rather drive 8 hours to Dollywood than go to Silver Dollar City. Damn...
37343,"They're pretty close to equally far, depending on where you actually are in Mississippi (Dollywood is an hour closer for me).

I think the bigger difference, though, is that the Smokies are a way more popular destination around here than Branson."
37344,Yeah I guess a better comparison would have been Six Flags over Georgia.
37345,Aw :(
37346,Oaks Park in Oregon even has pink lemonade drinking fountains.
37348,"Ohio's trends on King's Island: ""I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess""."
37349,Same can be said with Worlds of Fun.
37350,"SFFT for the win! I honestly love that park. There's something that just feels different when you visit. Everything just seems so upbeat and perfect, it's the farthest thing from a Six Flags."
37351,I'm simultaneously surprised and not surprised Washington like Silverwood more than our own home parks
37352,"SFOG is popular, but there is another park in Georgia that people probably don’t know exist."
37353,"Wild Adventures had a fair share of search results, while Fun Spot America Atlanta was def not popular."
37354,Oh... ok then
37355,"Wild Adventures? We know it exists, we just pretend that it doesn’t."
37356,"Kings Dominion over Busch Gardens Williamsburg? 

Not sure about your judgment anymore Virginia..."
37357,Way way off.
37358,KD over BG 🧐🧐🧐
37359,Ikr
37360,Castles n Coasters can't be that prominent can it? Geez that's amusing.
37361,"Aww man, I would give anything to be able to go. To Carowinds"
37362,Not surprised SFFT is more popular than SFOT. Biased bc SFFT is my home park but still.
37363,"It's a very close call between SFFT, SSA, and SFOT."
37364,I appreciate that Vermont likes New York’s arguably worst theme park the best
37365,Rip over Texas. You need a new eticket coaster
37366,"I’d disagree with Idaho. Northern Idaho is all about Silverwood, but SE Idaho, which has a larger population, barely realizes that it exists. South East Idaho is basically an extension of Utah, and everyone here loves Lagoon."
37367,"It's not surprising that Silverwood is more popular in the state considering it's actually in the state. I bet people in Coeur d'Alene search for (and visit) Silverwood a whole lot more than people in Idaho Falls/Pocatello search for/visit Lagoon.

Living in Boise, where truly the most people live, it's hard to say which of the two is more popular. Based on my limited interactions it seems to be Lagoon here as well, but they're both far enough away to be out of most peoples' radars.

I'm guessing a majority of the searches for amusements parks from the state are coming out of the CDA area, which overshadows searches from other parts of the state."
37368,"Yeah you’re probably right! Being only 3 hours away from lagoon here, nobody talks about Silverwood. That’s interesting about Boise! A theme park in the Boise area would be awesome"
37369,Interesting
37370,This post looks an awful lot like prohibited free distribution...
37371,"Universal Orlando. They have the money and the talent to really go all out on it. It is genuinely impressive and worth going for just that even if you skip all the rides. They really transform the whole park.

To a lesser extent, I've never been but I hear Silverwood is really great.

I don't how they've done the past few years, but halloween was the one thing I feel Kings Dominion did better than Busch Gardens Williamsburg. They really ramped up the scare zones the last time I was there during October (2016, I think) and they benefited greatly from having a bit more open space to play with."
37372,HHN might not be the oldest but it’s grown to be the best
37373,Was going to say the same thing. Nothing beats HHN
37374,Idk if they still do it but when I was there in 2014 they turned their car ride into a drive through haunted house.  You’d drive through the ride and people would jump out at you
37375,"I’m personally not into the IP stuff Universal has but I wasn’t impressed when I went 2019.  Yeah the sets are fantastic but it’s a total mobscene even on a Thursday in September and it’s a constant conga line through the houses and the scare actors are just eh for the most part, they were pretty limited to basic jumpscares.  Howl o Scream in Tampa was a lot less crowded and the actors had a lot more freedom to have fun interactions and it was far more enjoyable overall."
37376,"Kings island because of all the amazing night rides, especially Mystic Timbers and Beast which have themes that go perfect with Halloween. And the park does a good job with decoration, scare actors etc."
52541,This is the correct answer
37378,"omg hadn't thought of that, with the wood coasters there that sounds absolutely epic."
37379,"Universal, either Hollywood or Orlando"
37380,Tho I will say Orlando has more and is slightly better but it is also personal taste
37381,"Knoebel's is really special! Phoenix runs with all its lights off and some spooky theming, and there's even better super fun theming on the antique cars ride. This is based on my visit from last year"
37382,I swear they also grease it’s wheels or do something to make it run faster too. It’s awesome
37383,Really? My only visit to Knoebel's so far is actually that Halloween one
37384,The og knotts scary farm
37385,Knotts Scary Farm is really well done
37386,Anybody been to BGW’s Halloween event? Considering going this year but curious how it is. I’ve only ever been to Halloweekends at Cedar Point and it was a blast.
37387,"I've been several times. It's good. The houses are not the scariest I've done, but they are fun and they pay a decent amount if attention to detail. And the scare zones are all good. They put a lot of effort in to the scare actors, costumes and makeup, and the whole in the woods thing adds a lot of atmosphere to the whole thing. They also used to do an excellent end of night show at the theater near France. Not sure if they did it last year or will do it this year, but it was always good.

However, Kings Dominion at least used to be better. Their scare zones were just better and really tried to scare people. Their houses/trails weren't any better than BGW's, really, but the scare zones put them over the top and they really took advantage of the more open spaces for them."
37388,Interesting. Maybe I’ll have to check out both. Never bad to find an excuse to go ride Twisted Timbers. Thanks for your insight!
37389,"I went a few times back in 2018. Their houses aren't super scary compared to something like HHN at Universal, but they were decent and there were a lot of them. I don't know how it's going to be during COVID times, but at least then it was definitely enjoyable. They also have good shows during Howl-o-Scream and getting night rides on Apollo and Verbolten is always a plus."
37390,"Cedar Point. The haunted houses are decent, but the haunted walk through areas are where it’s at. Lots of actors interacting with park goers and the atmosphere is interesting."
37391,"I agree, and I work at Kennywood for Phantom Fright Nights. Their outside ""scare zones"" and haunts are top-notch. They can't do full-park theming because they're open all day, but at night, when the monsters come out... They're exceptional!"
37392,Walibi Holland
37393,What's it like? I'm going there this October!
37394,"Scariest thing ever, at least 15 years or so ago. Eddie the Clown for President! 🤡"
37395,How is great adventure during Halloween? I thought of going
37396,"It's pretty good. It's not too scary, it's mainly for kids which is good because I'm not crazy about scary haunted houses. It's pretty fun."
37397,"Depends if you are sensitive to gore/horror or not, I suppose. Personally I'm not, so I wasn't really scared/didn't scream ( got caught off guard a few times tho ), but my mom who was with me at the time was scared to death. ( talking about the maze thing, forgot name )"
37398,"HHN if you are looking for a legit Halloween event. Knoebels or one of the Herschend parks if you want a fall festival type event, some smaller parks do these pretty well and can be charming. The regional parks will be crazy packed and don’t update their events too much year to year, those aren’t really my thing."
37399,BGT is my home park and I’ve gone to Howl-O-Scream every year. I don’t know how it compares to other Halloween events but I like it.
37400,"Depends on what you're looking for in a Halloween event. Best haunted houses and scares are usually at HHN at Universal (Orlando is usually better, but Hollywood is good too). If you're looking for a more family centered event (with minimal scares or less strobe lights, which is a big thing for me) there's of course the Disney Parks, but I've heard HersheyPark is cool too, since they do some special things to some rides and don't really have scarezones or houses (And I'm actually going to their Halloween event this year)."
37401,Kings Island because every ride there gives amazing night rides.
37402,"Not sure if they still do this, but they used to have fog machines at the bottom of Beast’s first drop. When you crest the second lift, the view of the park covered in fog is amazing."
37403,It was either two or three years ago they had so many fog machines running on the midways you could not see from one end of the station to the other end of the station on Diamondback.
37404,None of 'em – it's the longest lines of the year for any park.
37405,Then you've obviously never been to Disneyland for Christmas...
37406,I have. CGA's Haunt is way way worse. At least DLR can handle the crowds (although I haven't been there post-covid).
37407,"No idea why you're getting downvoted, CGA is a fucking nightmare during haunt for all the wrong reasons."
37408,Europa Park also puts in a small amount of effort as well!
37410,Universal studios Orlando
37411,"I've only done Carowinds' Halloween event at night, so that by default (I visited BGW during last year's event, but the pandemic kept it from being any good, plus I went during the day). Between Fury and CS's night rides, that awesome stomp band, and the general look and feel of the place, I loved it. My only complaint was that damn cannonball sound effect that kept grating on my ears."
37412,Lake Compounce used to be top tier with the Haunted Graveyard and Boulder Dash night rides. Neither are happening this October though.
37413,"It may not be the best, but i think Knotts Berry Farm provides a very fun and thrilling Halloween experience"
37414,"None of them. Worst time of year to go to a park. Right after it ends though? Between Halloween and Christmas events. Perfect. Even better after Christmas.

Oh yea. I have year round parks near me. So probably not the same for everyone."
37415,Howl o scream is a lot better than HHN if you want scary just saying
37416,"Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. More roller coasters than you can shake a stick at and more rides in general! Love that place!"
37417,Agreed. I tried shaking a stick at all the rollercoasters and failed miserably.
37418,Grew up around there by far the best park ever still try to make it back there once every two years after I moved away.
37419,"Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Virginia, followed closely by Dollywood in Tennessee."
37420,"Had the pleasure of going to Action Park in New Jersey (USA) every summer growing up. Still have some scars from my time there but wouldn't trade them if I could!

Want an idea of how amazing it was.. Watch the documentary. 👍

https://www.classactionpark.com/"
37421,"yoooo, i almost forgot about that place. I went when it was called Mountain Creek, but it's the same place. Once you went there, the only way you could leave was with some piece of skin missing. At least, that's the legend.

I remember losing my wallet on that fucking cannonball slide (why did i take a wallet into a waterpark, and thought it was safe in my pocket?) that had like 60 dollars in it - I did not eat on that trip :( Also got a fun back scrape/burn.

The tarzan swing was pretty cool but holy fuck was that water *supernaturally* cold - i think most ppl tended to freeze up when they hit the water, but most ended up making it out fine - though there were always a few who grabbed on to the rope, but were too scared to let go and swung back to the other side, sometimes colliding on the other end. 

There was also that fucking cliff jump thing which to this day im not sure how it passed a safety inspection, or really have much of any kind of thought put into it. You just kinda jumped (or slid off a 3-ft slide) off of a faux cliff into a pool below which IIRC was woefully inadequately deep - not to mention people swimming out would have other jumpers basically land on top of them since it was kinda hard to tell when someone was swimming out below.

Lotta scrapes from that park, But it was still pretty fun. No idea if it's still open or cleaned up today, but it was probably one of the more interesting parks for sure!

Edit: Also just remembered some experience on some kind of water-slide ride - So i don't remember the name of the ride, but I *DO* remember that this was one steep motherfucker. It began as a rather unassuming black plastic tube (so it was pitch-black inside) and then opened up into a half-pipe - you were advised to ride down it a certain way (Arms folded, i think) and once out of the side, it would shoot you into a (again, freakishly cold) pool. The side didn't end like a ""normal one"" into a horizontal thing to slow you down, nope - that would be too safe - It just ended like a dozen feet above a pool and just fucking free-dropped you in. Hope you can swim!  Being a young me, i had closed my eyes during the ride to prepare for the splash, but unknowingly also un-crossed my arms, i *think*holding them at my sides? 

Well apparently according to my on-looking friends, i had been briefly ejected from the slide and caught some serious air going down before slamming back into the chute and then into the water. This was most likely due to the far-too-steep sloping. I apparently very nearly got *permanently* ejected! Whether or not this is true i have no idea - i remember going down, water spraying into my eyes, closing them, then uncrossing my arms, and next thing i knew I had made contact with the frigid pool at the bottom and swam back out, ready and hyped for the next ~~deathtrap~~ ride."
37422,"Still there, still Mountain Creek but that's a tamed version of Action Park.. You can still see where the concrete tracks came down the mountain. 👍"
37423,"Animal Kingdom at Disney World in Florida. People talk about the other Disney parks but sleep on AK, which is easily my favorite"
37424,"Loved that park. 

Me, wife, son and daughter, 10 and 9 years old then, While standing in the tunnel at the glass looking into the Hippo enclosure, a huge hippo floated up with its ass against the glass and let its bowels lose. It was shooting onto the glass for ever. Like 3 bales of green hay being shot at you. Good memories."
37425,"Cedar Point, Sandusky Ohio"
37426,"The best I’ve been to is Universal Studios Orlando in Orlando, Florida, United States. Disney World (also in Florida) is a close second."
37427,"Been to a lot...even a few in Europe.  Surprisingly, I still put Dollywood at the top of my list.  It's one of the cleanest parks I've ever been in, even cleaner than any Disney park on a good day.  Good rides, good variety, good food, great scenery.  Definitely worth it."
37428,"The best amusement parks are the ones that aren't crowded

it doesn't matter how good the rides are or whether or not they have the latest and greatest rollercoasters.

If the park is relatively empty...you will have an exponentially better time than going to the uber crowded park with all the crazy rides

The most fun I ever had at an amusement park was at Silver Dollar City in Branson Missouri.  I was there with a group from school on a weekday when barely anyone was around.

We just stayed on the roller coasters for like 20+ rides in a row because there was nobody else in line

It was the best"
37429,"Grew up in Missouri and Silver Dollar City was the summer amusement park for me. Sure, Disney and Universal can be fun, but if I’m choosing, I’m going to SDC. And maybe catch a show at the Stampede."
37430,Disney land. Florida. It was a great family vacation.
37431,Either Busch Garden in Virginia or Six Flags America in Maryland
37432,"Busch Gardens, Florida, US.

Alton Towers, Staffordshire, UK."
37433,I have never been out of state and live in Texas sooooo
37434,"Well, kings islands transition to cedar fair has been hugely successful. Multiple amazing installations. Diamond back, banshee, the new orion, the new family stuff, kiddie land rebranding.

Hersheypark also grew leaps and bounds. The crazy pace of additions there is wild. And unique rides, and theming, just keep coming. Both have vaulted into the discussion. 

Not like six flags has distanced themselves, magic mountain not withstanding. The over reach for the smaller parks, and operational issues have closed gap between them and competitors.  

Cedar fairs acquisitions has raised their exposure to more parts of country. Knotts is doing amazing things in a small footprint. 

Its a great time to be a park junkie."
37435,"Hate to be that guy, but Orion shouldn’t count for this discussion"
37436,Indeed it is.
37437,"If we're going with singular parks, it's hard to argue against Energylandia. I don't think we've seen a park built up that fast with the kind of quality that they have."
37438,Completely disagree. They have a few incredible coaster‘s but for the most part they just threw a bunch of kiddy coasters up with minimal theming just so they could get their numbers up. Despite the numbers they still have nothing on Cedar Point or Six Flags Magic Mountain when it comes to pure thrill rides.
37439,They’re cheaters. If Cedar Point was backed by government funding they’d have 5 gigas by now
37440,"Lol what, I’m sure almost every park out there has received some sort of government tax benefits, especially considering Cedar Fair is headquartered in Sandusky. Even ignoring all that, receiving government funding doesn’t make you a cheater."
37441,Dude you wanna go to a party together? You seem like you’d be fun at parties
37442,That’s rich saying a park cheated in a competition that doesn’t even really exist.
37443,I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you don’t know how sarcasm works
37444,Sarcasm's generally supposed to be obvious and actually funny.
37445,This is so fucking hypocritical I think you have every politician beat
37446,"Universal. Specifically Universal Orlando Resort and their Potter additions. With the opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Hogsmeade in 2010 they pretty much redefined what a theme park land could be, integrating attractions, food and merch seemlessly. Then they did it again in 2014 with Diagon Alley. And then this year with the opening of Hagrid's they continue to push the boundaries of what a themed attraction can be."
37447,"My initial thought was Universal. They came out of a shaky early 2000's into the strong teens, and are entertaining 2020 full force.

But... then again that would be overlooking the blunders and shortcomings they've had along the way. Both Jimmy Fallon, and Fast and Furious both are not just minor, but wild duds, with still underwhelming rides like the Transformers Ride, and the continuous operational issues of Hagrids. 

Universal feels like a strong contender, but then the many negatives really do detract."
37448,Fast and Furious is so bad I can't even take my friends on it as a joke. Ugh.
37449,"We made it into a drinking game where we’d drink every time they said family, or we saw family written.

Made it fun for a couple of times before we realized just drinking was even more fun."
37450,you guys should watch fate of the furious together
37451,"The live action pre-show guys would've killed you guys if you had the same crew that I did the one and only time I bothered to go on. They were intentionally hamming it up, repeating ""family"" two or three times for every time the recording said it."
37452,It's all about the preshow TMs.
37453,"Vin diesel: ""Yuh famlee now."" 

Me: ""do I have to be?"""
37454,The queue area is the only good part about that ride
37455,Completely agree. Disney is usually the king here but Universal takes the top spot this decade.
37456,"New fantasyland, Pandora, Galaxys edge, Toy Story Land, Cars Land >> Harry potter Hogsmead/Diagon Alley, Jimmy Fallon, Fast and Furious, King Kong.

I think your underestimating what Disney has done the past decade. Universal had 2 slam dunks with both Harry Potter areas, but the rest of their additions are duds. Disney has had a lot of huge upgrades and additions with none of them are underwhelming, and 2 of them being looked at as possibly the best rides in existence (Flight of Passage and Rise of the Resistance)."
37457,"Fair point. I was giving a lot more weight to what I consider the best expansion areas and not the sum total of everything added. I agree that Pandora is amazing looking but Flight of Passage does not rank high for me. Toy Story land was underwhelming, new Fantasyland the same but seven dwarves is great. Cars land is awesome and would be my pick for second best overall new land. Admittedly I have not been to Star Wars land yet and I won’t be until my sides is done next year. Totally forgot Florida just opened RotR."
37458,3rd times the charm.
37459,thank you took a while to figure it out
37460,My vote is for Carowinds. They built 3 high quality coasters and turned their park into a real destination park.
37461,Hey that’s my home park! I remember the time before Fury and Intimidator putting us on the map. It’s awesome to see it grow up so much and making it a household name in the theme park world.
37462,"I wouldn't call it a household name outside of the enthusiast circle. Whenever I travel around in the US alone to different parks and mention Carowinds, nobody has ever heard of it (even at other Cedar Fair parks)."
37463,"I find that really hard to believe. Even if they don't recognize ""Carowinds"", I've met loads of people who've heard of ""that giant green coaster in South Carolina... what's it called?"" ""Fury 325"" ""yeah I guess – I saw an article on it a few years ago"""
37464,"Knowing a coaster is far different than knowing a park. Many people have seen pictures of King Da Ka, TTD, or all those clickbait youtube coasters. Most people won't know where they are from. Here in the enthusiast bubble, we have a warped perception. I have a friend who lives an hour from Carowinds and doesn't even know anything about it."
37465,"Knowing a signature attraction *is* knowing a park... what are you talking about? Signature attractions are the things that put parks on the map. Far more enthusiasts *and* GP give a shit about Carowinds now that Fury is there.

Of course people still have never heard of it – I'm sure there are people in Charlotte that have never heard of it. But the fundamental reality is that most people don't travel. I'm sure loads of people loosely have Kingda Ka on their bucket list but will never get to New Jersey. Similarly loads of people have seen Fury and would like to ride it some day but probably aren't about to plan a trip to the Carolinas.

I don't know why you're getting so hung up on the ""enthusiast bubble"" qualifier. Loads of people haven't heard of Knoebels, including many unenlightened enthusiasts, but Knoebels is still world-famous."
37466,"If you think Knoebels is world famous, then that just proves his point."
37467,"But like... it is? Y'all settin' your standards for ""world famous"" too high. Knoebels doesn't have to be more famous than Billie Eilish to be relevant, hot damn. Loads of enthusiasts around the world know it just like loads of enthusiasts around the world know Holiday Park because of XGF. Phoenix is the #1 wooden coaster in the world, for Schilke's sake."
37468,"For sure. This park was maybe worth a few laps on Afterburn and a test ride on Nighthawk before, but now it is a destination park for people all over the US, GP or otherwise, and for people all around the world in the enthusiast circle"
37469,"Disney California Adventure went from meh to really good.

Since 2010 they added Cars Land, World of colours, remake the entrance, Guardians of the Galaxy and Pixar Pier. And Avengers Campus is coming."
37470,"I was thinking DCA it went from tacky to good with the front entrance, paradise pier, and cars land remodel. But then it went from good to tacky again with Pixar pier and guardians of the Galaxy. We'll see how the avengers campus goes but I'm tired of the themed IP lands. DCA is loosing it's identy and becoming a conglomeration of random lands based on random intellectual properties with no overarching theme at all."
37471,"California Adventure, while it got much better, had some misses though too. Pixar Pier honestly is a huge dud in my eyes. Comparing that section of the park to what Imagineering should be aspiring to just leaves me sad on the inside."
37472,I actually loved what DCA was before. It’s bums me out that it is really just the second half of Disneyland these days. It really is all one park now - they just get to charge separate admissions.
37473,I think this will be known as the decade that ended CF's reign at the top of US parks and the decade that was the start of amazing times for SEA parks.
37474,"But CF still spent most of the 2010s on top. For the most part, this was their decade, and the 2020s will belong to SWP&E."
37475,Except SEAS had a lot of rough years this decade because of Blackfish. They are bouncing back though which is good and 2020 will be very telling of how next decade will go.
37476,"They are transitioning from being primarily a zoo operator to being primarily a coaster operator with zoo operations secondary.  This is coming from remodeling the Seaworld parks on the Busch Gardens Tampa model, which has thrill coaster ops as primary draw, with zoo operations for family entertainment and for theming.  I think their intent is to keep operating as a large aquarium but to eventually end all of the marine mammal shows if public opinion continues to be turned against them by animal rights propaganda."
37477,"Agreed, this is the company to watch going Into the 20’s .  In my opinion they are sparing no expense this season, with just about every park getting a major new coaster,  and 2021 being every bit as good based on what I’ve read."
37478,Preach!
37479,"Energylania for this decade, but BGT is looking to have an insane decade"
37480,I live minutes away from Kings Island and go often but cedar point is the best in not just Ohio but the country
37481,True. But King’s Island has had the better last decade.
37482,"Idk about that, Cedar Point took their worst two rides and made one tolerable and the other one of the best rides on the planet while at the same time building two new shiny B&Ms and renovating entire areas of the park with them. That doesn't count the work on the resorts and water park they've put in."
37483,"Haven't been to many but sfgam, CP, ki and sdc come in mind for me"
37484,"I guess they wont win, but kings island has definitely stolen our hearts lately."
37485,"Disney parks. 

Turned California adventures into a great full day park with cars land, guardians of the galaxy, Pixar pier, and world of color, in addition to a fantastic Halloween party this year. 

They celebrated 60 years at Disneyland and refurbished MANY of their rides and shows, and opened up Galaxy’s Edge there AND at...

..Walt Disney World.  They opened up a skyliner transportation system. Seven dwarfs mine train. Frozen (RIP maelstrom). Opened Toy story land AND avatar land. 

Hong Kong opened their big thunder mountain, iron man experience, and created an exceptional ride experience with mystic manor. 

And, they opened Disneyland Shanghai."
37486,"I disagree. I think Disney is in trouble in Orlando. They are the obvious draw for international visitors, but Universal Orlando is catching up quickly here in the states. They have expanded wildly this decade and look to do even more in the next. Disney is now finding themselves playing catch up in trying to out-theme Potter, as it's become THE thing to see in Orlando for teens and millennials. I was driving to see Galaxies Edge this year and i drove past SeaWorld and saw Mako and wondered why the hell i'm not spending my day there. Plus Universal is about to open another park? Disney better look out."
37487,Mine had to be SFMM and it is my home park
37488,"Definitely some great new stuff this decade. If only they would put just a bit more effort into overall upkeep, atmosphere/theming and cleanliness, our home park would be second to none."
37489,"I was gonna say Tayto Park, but instead I say Energylandia. Tayto Park is starting to grow, but veeeerrrryyy slowly."
37490,I’m going to say UNIVERSAL JAPAN because they have without a doubt they best hogsmead and best forbidden journey. They also added flying dinosaur making it a must visit for enthusiasts. I just think this is a great park and definitely has a contender to be the best theme park of the decade.
37491,"Carowinds and Silver Dollar City are the parks I would put as doing the most impressive improvement in the decade.

 Kings Dominion closed more coasters than they opened. CP really only had SV this decade that's undebatably awesome. Six flags has generally put out half baked rides this decade"
37492,Dollywood
37493,"My vote, too.  With only Thunderhead and Tennessee Tornado going into the decade they have added unique attractions, expanded their festivals, and continue their story telling experiences.  All to the delight of their devoted guests and new fans to this park in the beautiful smoky mountains.  Wild Eagle, Lightning Rod, Fire Chaser Express and Dragonflier are all uniquely crowd pleasers."
37494,SF MF MM
37495,Well it’s not fucking Legoland that’s for sure
37496,Legoland is just the fucking worst. It’s galling that they have the wherewithal to charge almost Disney prices for their sad selection of rides and dirty old LEGO structures that are sun bleached and peeling.
37497,"Carowinds and Dollywood both had some incredible transformations this decade, though I have to give the edge to Dollywood in that regard."
37498,Knott's is pretty high on the list of theme parks I'd say
37499,"I was pretty happy with DCA up till 2017. 

Universal Orlando has really been pulling out all the stops it seems. Curious to see what Universal has in store for the future.

Knott's really seems to be branching out. I'm excited to see what the next decade has."
37500,"Probably not the outright winner, but Canada’s Wonderland has had its pretty damn huge decade of B&M."
37501,"Leviathan and YS? Two big rides, but Carowinds, Cedar Point, and Kings Island both got two new B&Ms as well, and that’s just in Cedar Fair."
37502,"Definitely Six Flags America! Well, because it's close to me and actually it's a good park in spite of what you may have heard."
37503,Six Flags because they're really feeling it with the comic book characters (they even put Grid in a ride.)
37504,"Disney really improved in the past few years. Think about it, Pandora, Toy Story land, Galaxy's edge, with all the new additions I really wanna come back here soon."
37505,"Carowinds, cedar point (yes I know I’ll get hate) or universal islands of adventure"
37506,Half the parks on this list aren’t even theme parks…
37507,Cedar point cause... you know...
37508,"CP 2000's: Millennium Force, Wicked Twister, Top Thrill Dragster, Maverick. Basically 3 coasters that really pushed the envelope and changed the industry forever.

CP 2010's: Gatekeeper, Valravn, and Steel Vengeance. While Steel Vengeance is excellent and easily the best ride there, these 3 rides aren't nearly as revolutionary as MF, TTD, and Maverick. Not to mention that this decade saw many things implemented to the detriment to the park, in my opinion, such as a paid locker system and fast lane.

Other parks have done quite a bit more this decade over CP in my opinion. Dollywood and Silver Dollar City, for example, have both put in many unique and pioneering rides such as Outlaw Run, Lightning Rod, Time Traveler,  not to mention extensive expansions to both parks in the recent years. Cedar Point is a great park, but the name they built for themselves in the industry back in the 2000's is long gone and other parks have come to fill that void."
37509,"It’s my favorite amusement park, so the best of the decade also OK BOOMER"
37510,favorite is not synonymous with best
37511,Idc
37512,"IMO  Silver Dollar city is better than Six Flags in Missouri. Holiday World is awesome in Indiana, the Water park is world class and the coasters are
 good, the other rides are pretty blah though"
37513,"Silver Dollar City is the clear choice. Even though I am a big fan of SFStL, and Worlds of Fun."
37514,SDC is the best theme park in America period!
37515,I feel like Holiday World should invest in several really good flat rides
37516,Camden Park is easily the best park in West Virginia. There's literally no competition.
37517,Their wood coaster is stupid fun.  I love it.

37519,I'd take Six Flags Magic Mountain over Knott's for California.
37520,"I'd take Disneyland over both, and it's really no contest."
37521,"I'll take Knott's over Magic Mountain.

I was pretty disappointed in Magic Mountain as a park. Great coasters, trashy park."
37522,"Just curious, what did you find trashy about it?  I've been there a few times and had great experiences."
37523,"Mostly typical Six Flags issues.
Apathetic or Rude staff.
Asphalt paths cracking or full of potholes.
Trash on the hillsides over fences and retaining walls (really bad by X2).
Advertisements plastered all over the place.
Low effort or a lack of landscaping.
Very disappointing merchandise offerings.

And specific to Magic Mountain, very small ride selection outside of the coasters."
37524,"For South Dakota, I would make a argument for Rush Mountain adventure park. Sure, it's only coaster is a alpine coaster, but it has more attractions for the whole family, whereas storybook land is pretty much a themed children's playground that happens to have a few rides."
37525,Carowinds is in both NC and SC. Also for OH you can make an argument for KI as well.
37526,"Well I didn’t want to include Carowinds twice, and Kings Island while still being a great park, doesn’t really come close to Cedar Point."
37527,"I'll take KI over CP any time.

CP has amazing rides, don't get me wrong, but I was disappointed with pretty much everything else about the park when I was there last week. Lines were insane. What good are rides if you can't actually get on them? Employees didn't care to enforce line rules. Half the park was closed (5 rides, half the bathrooms, half the restaurants). I get that COVID is affecting things these days, but KI seems to be handling it far better than CP."
37528,You could make that argument and lose.
37529,Texas’s two are pretty interchangeable imo. Fiesta is my pref but barely.
37530,"For sure. IMO Over Texas has a more well rounded lineup than Fiesta Texas, but Fiesta Texas is a better looking park. Too bad FT forgot the shade.

I'd rather have Shock Wave than Superman, Mr. Freeze than Poltergeist, Superman than Scream... Wonder Woman has no comparison, but both parks have a Freespin, a Discovery, a Batman Clone, a Pandemonium, a Hybrid (I rank them pretty evenly, Rattler is too short to be better than NTG). Also despite Road Runner Express being a better coaster, Runaway Mine Train is well themed and has massive historical value. La Vibora, Titan, and Judge, also have no comparison to any rides at Fiesta Texas."
37531,"I feel like FT could easily battle back with one more big ride of some sort, they’ve always felt like there was something missing between Titan/NTG and the rest of the lineup."
37532,"Fiesta Texas needs one or 2 more big coasters. I think a GCI woodie and a Hyper of some sort would give that park one of the best lineups in the nation. Over Texas needs a modern looper, like a floorless or new gen Vekoma, along with a modern multi-launch coaster."
37533,"You forgot Missouri, but I can't say I blame you, I often forget we exist too"
37534,Need to put in a vote for Busch Gardens Williamsburg - easily the best park in Virginia.
37535,"Knoebels in Pennsylvania, Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey"
37536,"Mmm, Hersheypark has a case too."
37537,"I'd vote more for Knoebels. Always have a great day there. Last couple visits I've had at Hershey went bad. Ranging from having sunglasses and almost my wallet stolen at Skyrush, another visit being unbearable in the heat and half the food stands I wanted were either beyond busy or just for some reason not open that day."
37538,"It depends what you're looking for. If you want a whole bunch of great roller coasters, then Hersheypark is for you. However, if you want a throwback in time to an amusement park that is truly like no other, then Knoebels is for you."
37539,Hershey has great coasters but in between rides for some odd reason I rarely have a good day there. Never had any issues at Knoebels at all.
37540,"Kennywood as well

EDIT: Also Kennywood and Hershey are like the only two parks I know of with two hyper coasters that are basically the same.

I mean sure dae point has SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn but those are pretty different but like Hersheypark has two airtime machines and Kennywood built two record breaking loopers.

EDIT2: made my point in edit1 clearer"
37541,"Hmmm, but even the old Steel Phantom was vastly different from Steel Curtain today; I wouldn’t call them “basically the same.”

Also SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn offer completely different ride experiences. Aside from being hypers, they have nothing else in common. They were even manufactured by three different companies."
37542,"My friend my point was that Cedar Point’s three 200-300 footers are all very different and have different design goals, whereas Steel Phantom and Steel Curtain were both made to be record breaking looping coasters over 200 feet and breaking/matching the us inversion record.

CP= not the same
Kennywood = kind of the same"
37543,"I know Kennywood is loved, and I really like Thunderbolt and Phantom's Revenge, but I just have never had a great day there for some reason.  I can't put my finger on it.  I usually do KW at the end of a roadtrip so I suspect that has something to do with it."
37544,"Yes

DO IT FOR ALL YOUR ROADTRIP

EAT NOTHIJG BUT KENNYWOOD

SLEEP AT KENNYWOOD

MARRY PHANTOMS REVENGE"
37545,Hershey reeeeally needed floater air. Like Comet was it in terms of floater before CM.
37546,"It sure does, I just like Knoebels better."
37547,Never even heard of Knoebels...

37549,Recommend you go.  Has one of the best wooden coasters in the world.
37550,"Twister is great, but I wouldn’t say that it’s one of the best in the world."
37551,I'm sure you know this but I meant Phoenix.  Which you obviously think is overrated.
37552,Twister smoked Phoenix for me this past weekend and I loved Phoenix. Both are in my top 15 now. Knoebels is amazing.
37553,I heard Twister is running great this year. Have not been yet personally
37554,"We hit knoebels, hershey and dorney last weekend. Hands down, knoebels gets my vote (havent been to kw). Skyrush for me, is still the best coaster in the state, but Twisters not far off."
37555,For Florida it’s a tie between IOA and BGT the problem here is if you come in the summer it rains every afternoon and BGT has all outdoor rides so everything gets shut down meanwhile IOA doesn’t.
37556,*Animal Kingdom has entered the chat*
37557,"You’re lying right? 
Living in Orlando means avoiding Disney at all costs.
Universal is better."
37558,"I have Disney and SWO/BGT passes, I'm not into Universal at all.  Outside the HP areas, which are awesome, Universal is lacking.  AK takes theming to an entirely new level. Plus AK food >>> anything at Universal."
37559,"If you’re more into theming, animatronics, and fun family rides you go to IOA. If you’re a thrill seeker and looking for the best coasters in FL, you go to BGT."
37560,"I mean, being honest BGT mainly has rides that go upside down and they yet don’t have an air time focused ride, neither does IOA but in my opinion hurts it a lot. I would rather ride Mako than 99% of the coasters at BGT, Tigris being the only one I’d take i think."
37561,My home state (Missouri)'s best park by far is Silver Dollar City.
37562,"It's subjective y'all. But I think the most well rounded park in Florida is Islands of Adventure. Best themed is Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom, and best coasters is Busch Gardens."
37563,Well there are easy states (Canobie Lake Park in New Hampshire) and there are hard states (Pennsylvania and Ohio)
37564,Mt. Olympus in Wisconsin.
37565,Um no it might be the biggest but Bay Beach is way better.
37566,"Bay Beach is much nicer but they are definitely geared more towards family's with children. For an enthusiast, Mt. Olympus has more to offer."
37567,PA- Hershey! I’m going tomorrow!
37568,King's dominion for VA and SFOG for Georgia these are the only states where I've been to all of the big parks in that state
