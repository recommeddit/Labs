41273,skin flute
41274,I bet you can really make them sing.
41275,I like ancient sounding music so this [ancient lyre replica from Mesopotamia sounds mesmerizing](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QRxsZhjg) And the link in the description is [pretty interesting also.](http://www.peterpringle.com/silverlyre.html)
41276,Harmonica
41277,Lap Slide Guitar in the style of David Gilmour.
41278,"With the right combination of effects and delay, electric guitar."
41279,I really like the sound of the erhu.
41280,"I like the cello, violin, and piano but I also enjoy the harmonica and bagpipes, not together of course."
41281,Ukulele. It just makes me feel so damn peppy
41282,Harpsichord. Almost everything sounds good on the Harpsicord.
41283,Tuba
41284,"Nyckelharpa, a Swedish instrument apparently made by shooting a cuckoo clock into a viola at high speed.

And it sounds like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YepLYesGnRM"
41286,"Sorry, but no. This is not an instrument. That's like saying my mouse is the best sounding instrument because I can click play on a video."
41289,"Well where do we draw the line between calling a piano an instrument and calling a launchpad an instrument? When you press a button on a launchpad, a set sound or musical note is played. When you press a button (or key) on a piano, a set musical note is played. The only difference is the delivery method (launchpads complete a circuit whereas pianos pivot a hammer). In the end, you're both pressing buttons in a complex manner to create music. I mean if we assume launchpads weren't instruments, then that would make electric keyboards not instruments as well."
41290,"When I press my mouse on the play button of itunes, a set sound is played. This is clearly not an instrument. I think we agree there is a line somewhere, but disagree on the location of the line. Interesting debate for sure :)

Where would you say the line is drawn?"
41291,"Yeah it's a hard debate... Both sides have valid arguments. Perhaps instruments should be classified as objects that make a single note. I've seen people using launchpads on youtube by just pressing a button and having it play 3 seconds of a song and remix it with drums. To me, that's more of a on-the-go garage band application. There are other videos where people individually play each note and, to me, that's the musical instrument part of launchpads."
41293,"I second this. Also don't forget Hard Rock/Heavy Metal shredding, it sounds so awesome. \m/"
41294,[Glass Harmonica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQemvyyJ--g)
41295,I think this is the kind of sound that can only work for a very few songs. Even this one needs a LOT of backup.
41296,Isn't it the instrument they played the opening theme to Harry Potter on? I like that song. It's very... neat.
41297,"i don't know the opening theme to Harry Potter, and thus have no idea."
41298,OBOE
41299,"Worst sounding instrument?

Two oboes playing in unison."
41301,And it doesn't get much better until halfway through university.
41303,"Haha this is true. The most beautiful oboe player can be ruined by another less-stellar oboe player. 

To be fair, double reed instruments are very difficult, intonation-wise."
41304,that's because you failed to take the necessary prerequisite step to make them properly play in unison.
41305,Cor anglais!
41306,"Human voice and it sounds best in Ode to joy

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pbMUEHvoAo

skip to5:25 awesomeness"
41307,Hammond B3. So much soul.
41308,I took years of keyboard lessons and it never stuck. I play the drums but I've owned 3 Hammond organs and currently have a '68 C-3 and a '73 Leslie. I haul it (and my Rhodes) around in my van just so my keyboard player can use it!
41309,"jealous man, wish we had a keyboard player. been looking!"
41310,"I'd looked for over 10 years but could never find one that didn't just want to play jazz. (or was older than my father) Just got this guy a month or so ago. He'd never even sat behind a Hammond before, but he's picking it up quick and he loves the hell out of it!. He's played lots of piano and really digs my Rhodes, too."
41311,"Nothing's prettier than a violin. For a fairly mainstream example, listen to the opening of Bittersweet Symphony."
41362,The human voice.
41313,"Native American flute.  Check out Carlos Nakai, specifically "" Honoring"""
41314,"Trumpet, anything by Chris Botti is awesome."
41315,"I came here to say piano and acoustic guitar. When I read the comments, I was nodding along. Everyone's opinions here would make for a lovely, interesting, unique symphony.

Someone write the score?"
41316,"Clarinet, I love the sound of it."
41317,Church organ for sure! Love me a good toccata.
41318,"Harps are amazing, but I like the yamizen... Kamizen... Shamizen... That 3 string japanese one. I'm noy sure why but it sounds beautifully simple and cultural."
41319,French Horn and the opening statement of Jupiter from Holst's The Planets.
41320,The violin is amazing in my opinion
41321,"I play bass guitar, so I'm inclined to say bass.

But we all know that's a crock of shit, and that the harmonica and/or piano is one of the best sounding instruments in the right hands."
41322,"I would have to say acoustic guitar, especially if it's played Flamenco style."
41323,"Oboe, ""I believe I can fly"", R. Kelly...space jam, that is all."
41324,"Harp or a hang drum. 
Everyone knows the harp it's very peaceful. The hang drum is more exciting and new-age yet feels familiar."
41325,A 5mm stainless steel rod.
41326,Ondes Martinot. There is a live version of Radiohead performing how to disappear completely with three or four of them and the sound is incredible.
41327,"The Organ. If it is a big one there is no limit to the sounds that you can get out of it, I am thinking monstrous great romantic organs like the one in saint-sulpice in Paris. It can be so loud that the floor shakes or so quiet that you can barely hear it. So high that it is only a squeak or so low that you cannot hear it at all except for a deep bass rumble on the edge of hearing. Also the separated manuals gives you huge flexibility in the way that you combine sounds and then slowly add them in over the course of the piece. [Widor's sixth symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rizCafG_ou8) is a real example of this."
41328,"my dick, just give it a blow and youll see why i like its sound."
41329,So it's a mouth organ?
41330,The glass harmonica. It's basically a set of spinning wine glasses that are positioned like a piano.
41331,"So many instruments have their own unique beauty. The [Armenian Duduk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdA1TrlDwAA) produces one of my favourite sounds, though.

I can't say which song it's the best in, but I love the music that introduced me to the instrument, the opening to [Myst III - Exile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcgsbmPvm9U), composed by Jack Wall."
41332,Cello is unbeatable.
41333,Vibraphone!
41334,Piano. It sounds good in pretty much any song.
41335,"There's this instrument that is bowls inside each other on there sides and it spins and you run your finger across it. It is the most hauntingly beautiful thing I have ever heard, I don't know the name of it but I would love to own and play one."
41336,"That would be the Glass Harmonica, invented by Ben Franklin, the Bob Moog of his era."
41337,Yes thankyou!
41338,Sometimes voice is the best. e.g. diva from Blood+
41339,"Guitar, when in the hands of Mark Knopfler."
41340,"The melodica. 

I have fallen in love with its dulce tones."
41341,"Drums hands down. A great drum line can make an ok song amazing for me. P.O.D.'s Youth of the Nation, Disturbed's, Down With the Sickness, and Metallica's Until it Sleeps are some of my favorites to listen to purely based on the drums in them."
41342,"My body has always been ready for this question! The marimba, hands down, it's so beautiful especially when you play it in a closed space (like a small room) so the sound can bounce off the walls. The whole experience is quite orgasmic. It would be even better accompanied with a violin or cello, oh god it would be the most beautiful thing to be experienced."
41343,The computer. Capable of creating many sounds depending on what programming it has.
41344,[Dat kick doe](https://soundcloud.com/fuckmylife/dat-kick-doe)
41345,"The sackbut. Just say it. 
It's so satisfying. Rolls right off my tongue."
41346,"I'm not sure what is the *best* sounding.  But I have to say, I really do love the sound of the bagpipes and steel drums..."
41551,At the same time?
41348,"heh. No, definitely separately."
41349,"Strings: Cello

Brass: Euphonium

Woodwind: Oboe"
41350,"You and I have similar tastes, rich, woody, full sounds are the best."
41351,The guitar. Fuckin' hipsters.
41352,"Gibson Les Paul plugged into a 1968 Marshall Lead with a nice crisp amount of fuzz, from a Big Muff or something similar."
41353,It's hard to do any better than talented violinists playing Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C
41354,"I love the guitar, acoustic or electric. My favorite electric guitar song is [Falling In Love Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5UHCMlL7E) by Jack Thammarat.

I also love the sound of a well-trained vocalist. [Music of the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Zci-3ZvYg) with Ramin Karimloo."
41355,Autotune
41356,"The china cymbal on drums 

[Example](http://youtu.be/aGME-bFePOw?t=2m5s)"
41357,Laser harp
41358,"Whatever the answer, harmonica is wrong."
41359,Autoharp.
41360,1971 Rhodes Suitcase Electric Piano. No contest.
41361,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1nBPRZc-I (link for the uninitiated). This is used a lot in neo soul, R&B, and Jazz. I can't get enough of it."
41363,Rhodes. Sounds amazing in any song.
41364,The hang
41365,"[guzheng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujzMHLac404)

[or maybe this'll suit your tastes better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL-hiPq5sCg)"
41366,moog synth or a nord  synth... impressive how good nord's piano and organ emulation is.
41367,"The human voice.

I had a music teacher once that told me every instrument ever created was made with the intent on mimicking the human voice. It was said to be a holy instrument if you were a great singer in the past. I can see why singers nowadays get the praise that they do. We have been praising them for all of time..."
41368,Panflute
41369,Definitely the [musical saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmft674XPC0).
41370,"Steel drums, anyone?"
41372,Like a trumpet played by the angels in heaven.

41380,"guitar then piano. 

but guitar is definitely first."
41381,"Nah, it's singing, then guitar, then piano. But being able to play a little music isn't gonna get you the chicks. Oh no. You need to play pretty well, and then get out there and actually play.

But the number one way to get girls to talk to you with music would be to have a crowd looking at you. Girls fucking love it when some guy is important, and if there are 20 people watching you work, you're important to somebody.

So if you want my advice, learn how to play in front of a crowd."
41382,"exactly. I totally cream my pants whenever my boyfriend plays the guitar or sings for me because he's really really good at it. whenever we go camping with friends, everyone shuts the fuck up and listens to him play for hours. Hot. as. fuck."
41383,[Harmonica with Drunken Vocals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbOTaic8lxc)
41384,Electric trangalelelute.
41385,"Playing guitar is the second best way to get laid. First being roofies, obv."
41386,"Trumpet, Alto/Tenor Sax, and Flute. Jazz flute is sexy as fuck! (reference: Anchorman bar scene!)"
41387,bitches love harmoniums
41388,Either. Guitar is portable though. Unless you keytar it up!
41389,"Guitar. It's more versatile and you can bring it with you anywhere you go. Some chicks prefer the piano over the guitar, but if you're good and can sing, you'll blow them away. And they'll blow you  YEAAAAAAAAAAAHH"
41390,The goods don't maketh the man. Just pick up any damn instrument and play it like you own it.
41391,Ukulele. It's like a cute miniature guitar.
41392,I personally love the piano. I think anyone could play the guitar if he tried so I don't put much stock in that. If you just want to get laid though then go for the guitar.
41393,Hairy Banjo
41394,The Theremin!!! Romantic and creepy!!! O_o
41395,"Bass, cause then you would be cool, relaxed and your sense of rhythm will unlock primal urges. 

My bass teacher put it ever so bluntly: ""Your job  bassactionbastard, is to make the women shake their ass on the dance floor."""
41397,keytar.
41547,Every instrument is hard to master. Some instruments are harder to start and get to the point and get to the point where a you can make sounds that any would want to listen to. I think brass and double reeds are difficult for beginners. Keyboard instruments probably have the highest skill ceiling.
41548,"Well each instrument has its own challenges, of course, however it is said (at least of orchestral instruments) that Oboe and French Horn are the hardest. 

Having tried both, I can definitely say Oboe it the hardest starting out, as it requires an immense amount of effort to get a sound, let alone a good one.

Just my two cents."
41549,Bassoon is even harder than oboe
41550,my guess is organ and viola
41552,"Especially at the same time.

Fun fact: Nicolaus Bruhns (17th Century North German organist/composer) would reportedly frequently play the violin while accompanying himself on the organ pedals."
41553,I've heard that rumor! What a spectacle.
41554,teremin
41555,"I play piano and viola, and I would say the piano is definitely harder. Anecdotally, I have also found that people generally take longer to progress to an advanced level on the piano than on most other instruments. There are a few instruments with specific reputations for difficulty, particularly the oboe and the French horn, but I am not so familiar with these."
41556,"I play piano and French horn, I would definitely say the French horn is more difficult, but of course piano is no walk in the park to get good at either."
41557,"Well, all instruments are difficult. I personally don't see any that is more than all others, but I do see some that are more difficult than other some. In general lines, to me, those instruments on which you can make a good sounding note on the very first day are the easiest. They include the keyboards, tambourine and the recorder, among others. The instruments you need to take months or years to produce a good sounding note are of course the hardest ones. They include the majority of instruments, of which I mention the winds (flute, oboe, trompet etc.) and the strings (guitar, violin, cello)."
41558,"I don't think you can produce a good sounding note on the recorder on the first day, though."
41559,It's just my experience but I was able to play a tune in the first day I picked the recorder.
41560,"Piano may be one of the “easier” ones at first, but it’s a difficult instrument in the long run because the field is so over saturated.

Edit: see comment below for clarity"
41561,"You mean it's difficult bc you have to be exceedingly good to be hired? That would be an employment difficulty, not a playing one."
41562,"It does have a very high skill ceiling as well. However, yes, a lot of the difficulty with being a professional pianist is that merely being a good pianist doesn't mean you'll get work. Hell, being a great pianist doesn't necessarily mean you'll get work."
41563,"Not just that but someone else also mentioned the skill ceiling. The expectations for what is “good” also keeps rising. If you look at competition winners and pros from the 70s and 80s vs now there’s a huge leap in expectations and skill level. It can be said for almost any instrument but because of the high competition/over saturation of the field it pushes the envelope of expectations of what is “good” at an extremely fast rate. They are expected to practice longer than some other instruments because the physical aspect of playing piano allows them to play their instruments for longer than brass, woodwinds, and stringed instruments. On top of that, because many people are able to start piano when they are younger there are higher expectations about what they should be able to do at a younger age. So not really an employment difficulty, because of the over saturation but a change of perception of what is considered “good” in the field because of the high competition."
41564,"In practice I believe we can see good playing skills as something objective - you play good if you sound good. How good you are is the subjective part I think. As such, in my view the piano would still be one of the easiest instruments because you'd be able to sound good, good in any given measure, fairly quickly."
41565,I guess that’s true but I think I’d probably say it’s easy-ish to learn and get mediocre at but one of the harder instruments to master
41566,"Unironically, the viola is one of the hardest instruments to learn and play well."
41567,Do you think it’s harder than violin?
41568,"Definitely. It's larger size requires a farther left hand stretch + more energy needed to keep the instrument upright. Also, the physical properties of the viola make tone production a big challenge."
41569,"But it’s much harder to become a violinist due to the over saturation of the field, and there is more solo repertoire for the violin."
41570,"Awesome username, u/the_rite_of_lingling

There are more violinists than violists because of the instrument's popularity and necessity. I don't quite get what you mean by over saturation."
41571,"Thanks! I thought I’d combine my love for Stravinsky with Twoset 😂

Sorry, I saw someone else say it and I thought it was a good way of describing the instrument’s popularity/necessity. I just meant there was more competition basically."
41572,"Ah, I see what you mean now, all good!"
41573,"It depends what you mean by difficult....

If you mean the most difficult to become a professional in, one would have to say piano or violin as, like someone commented on this post before, the fields of both those instruments are so over-saturated. 

One could say that piano is the easiest to start learning, as it is not difficult to make a sound. In the long run, piano gets a lot more difficult! 
What I usually think of the main woodwinds is (and don’t hate me guys!!) in terms of ease to play or to just get a sound
saxophone > flute > clarinet > oboe > bassoon 
However saying this, I know people who have made sounds on bassoon/oboe first try and haven’t been able to make any sound on clarinet for months. Honorary mention to bass clarinet! Difficult. 

I have also heard that organ is particularly tricky, and french horn"
41574,"Others are talking about which are physically the most difficult to play, but for me as a keyboardist, the *mental* demands of playing multiple voices/parts at once is the most challenging aspect. It's a lot of info to work with."
41575,"Just as a spectator, the most intimidating would have to be a full pipe organ, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mVSoikeA0o&list=PL85SeV5T5VK2mqym5fGwOc9qA8HswnzAd) at St. Ouen, where the organist is facing 5 manual keyboards, dozen of stops, and another keyboard for the feet. She has a couple of assistants for the registrations, page turnings etc.  A hugely responsible piece of work and a genuine tour de force."
41576,"I played a bit, and it's not that much harder than piano. To play like Ton Koopman, that's hard, but that goes for every instrument: composers keep writing until they've written something that can't be performed."
41577,"Anyway, here’s *Wonderwall*."
41578,"All instruments are very hard and require thousands of hours of practice to improve but in my personal opinion, the viola is one of the harder instruments. It is abnormally big, and there are not too many concertos for viola.  Of the few I know of, the skill gap between them in very large. So in short, an instrument with more music may be easier to progress with than one without too many options"
41580,Loved watching Paprika. I believe Nolan was inspired by Paprika when making Inception
41582,[XD](https://imgur.com/zOuqKjT)
41583,Definitely this.
41584,Is paprika and inception too similar? I don't want to watch paprika and feel like I'm just watching an anime version of inception
41585,"No, they are different enough. The big similarity is the concept of a machine that let's you enter someone's dream. Paprika is amazing, I highly recommend it."
41586,"> The big similarity is the concept

and the visuals"
41587,I've always wanted to watch it but I was always hesitant it'd be another inception - I will tho now
41588,"No, they're different."
41589,Not Similar at all. No one mentions that this is subtitles Japanese animation vs an actual movie.  Not that it matters to much but I was a bit surprised when I went to watch it (I can’t do subtitles) and it was like this. I was disappointed
41590,"> No one mentions that this is subtitles Japanese animation vs an actual movie. 

No one mentions it because it's stark fucking obvious.

""I can't do subtitles"" - is the US education system so bad that you guys can't even READ?"
41591,Actuallly. It’s called I use airplay on iPhone and for some reason it won’t disable subtitles unless it imbedded in the screen. I have no problems with anime but I’ve seen so many movies on here and then go to watch them and can’t because they have subtitles. No else’s fault I suppose besides apple for being fucking lame.
41592,I’m not sure how it’s obvious when only titles for movies are displayed besides spending the time looking up the movie first
41593,Looper had that feel for me. Maybe because JGL was in both.
41594,JGL is absolutely amazing.
41595,Would you say that you Joseph Gordon love him?
41596,"HAHA wonderful joke.

And yes, I would."
41598,No that’s Shrek
41599,"You should watch pretty much everything Nolan has ever done. Most of his movies deal with some weird concept. Memento, The Prestige, Interstellar & Tenet at least.

Charlie Kaufman films should also interest you. Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind, Synecdoche New York and Anomalisa at least.

Some other movies that should interest you: The Usual Suspects, Seven, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Open You Eyes (or the remake: Vanilla Sky), L'Appartement (or the remake: Wicker Park)."
41600,Which one do u recommend - open your eyes vs vanilla sky?
41601,Definitely Vanilla Sky. I've seen both and I gotta say that Penelope Cruz is much more likeable as a ballet dancer than as a mime.
41602,"Open Your Eyes but that's in Spanish so if you can only watch movies spoken in English, watch Vanilla Sky."
41603,Thank you! I’ll look at all of these. :)
41604,Following (his first film) is good as well.
41605,"Along the lines of your Vanilla Sky recommendation: movies based on Philip K Dick stories, including Paycheck, Minority Report, Impostor, and The Adjustment Bureau."
41606,Watch 'Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind'
41607,Absolutely love that movie!!
41608,Yes me too
41609,"They don’t have anywhere near Inception’s budget, but there are a few smaller movies that have similarly trippy concepts, if that’s what you’re looking for:

- Primer is about two guys that inadvertently discover time-travel while doing experiments in their garage. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen it, but I remember being really intrigued (and a little confused) by it.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/?ref_=fn_al_tt_0

- Coherence is about traversing multiple dimensions, I think? I’ve only seen parts of it, but I liked what I saw and everyone seems to love it. I see it recommended a lot.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0

- LFO is about a lonely audio engineer that accidentally creates a frequency that can hypnotize people. (Subtitles)

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2660332/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1

- The Endless is about a cult and time loops. Ngl I actually wasn’t super into this one, but it got a lot of good reviews so I guess I’m in the minority with that opinion.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3986820/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0

That’s all I’ve got off the top of my head but I’ll post more if I think of any."
41610,Coherence is good shit
41611,I think Endless is streaming on Netflix/or hulu right now.
41613,"Posting again because I almost forgot the most important suggestion:

[POSSESSOR ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5918982/)

Possessor was my favorite movie of 2020 and very similar to Inception, only way, waaaay darker. It’s about a shadow organization that takes over people’s bodies and uses them to commit assassinatons. Highly recommend this one, but heads up: nudity and GRAPHIC violence warning. If you decide to watch it, make sure it’s the uncut version. The title will specifically say “UNCUT.”"
41614,Yesssss. I feel like Possessor went kind of unnoticed. It was easily my favorite movie last year.
41615,"Okay, thank you so much!! 
I’ll be sure to keep those things in mind.

The movie sounds reallyyyy interesting."

41639,"Ooh, great suggestion! Definitely second this one!"
41640,"Paprika. Clearly the inspiration for Inception, there are even some scenes that are almost identical."
41641,"I feel like the term ""inspirational"" is a bit soft Nolan straight up steals from the movie."
41642,Looper is good. Fight Club also a classic. Matrix also
41643,*Dark City*
41644,Yes!  This is what I should have recommended :)
41645,Coherence (2013) is an amazing mind-bending sci-fi.
41646,"Source Code is very similar

Bit of a stretch but Solaris (1972) is way different in tone but deals with a person's mind effecting the world around them"
41647,"Predestination....that's one serious mind f.....
Also Tenet is a good one, mind you I've watched it twice and still don't get it lol"
41648,"I’ll check those out!

Yeesh. Twice and still no clue what’s going on? 😂"
41649,"If you haven't seen *Memento,* which was what put Nolan in the view of mainstream filmgoers, it's definitely worth a watch.

Can you say more about what you liked about *Inception* that you're looking for in other movies? Was it the style itself, the team-pulls-off-a-heist story, the high concept of going into someone else's mind, the ambiguity factor, the grand landscapes/set-pieces? Knowing more about what you're looking for might help folks give better recommendations.

For a completely off-the-wall recommendation, but one which may be a kind of spiritual sibling to *Inception,* check out *Dave Made A Maze* if you want to have some fun. 

Best of luck!"
41650,Thank you so much! I’ll check those out! I also updated my post to make it a little easier on others. :)
41651,"Not a problem. And based on your update, I'd definitely say *Dave Made A Maze* falls into that category. It's a bit zany, while *Inception* is very brooding, but certainly fits that bill.

Hope you get a lot of other great suggestions as well!"
41652,"Thank you once again, I really appreciate it! I’ll check those out too. :)"
41653,*Dave Made A Maze* is an absolute hoot!
41654,Memento was pure magic. Saw it a few months ago.
41655,Tenet. Also Christopher Nolan. Same kind of action-thriller with a sci-fi twist as Inception.
41656,Its even a harder mindfuck than Inception
41657,"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - really great movie

Forbidden Planet is an old movie but is quite good


Not a fan of it, but Sphere with Dustin Hoffman fits your request.

You may like What Dreams May Come with Robin Williams"
41658,I loveeee Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!! Thank you for the suggestions. :)
41659,- Mr. Nobody
41660,"I recently watched Total Recall (I know is old) but it reminded me of Inception, how many turns in the plot etc"
41661,"I love Total Recall .  I like the Originals, but the remake is good too."
41662,Haven't seen the remake!
41663,"Not at all in the sci-fi realm, but you might like [*Stranger Than Fiction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)), where a man finds his entire life being narrated by an unseen female voice.  Quite good performance by Will Farrell, in a rare toned-down role."
41664,"\- Inception (Heist movie + Sci-Fi)

\- Tenet (Agent movie + Sci-Fi). 

\- Vanilla Sky

\- The empty man: (has a few similarities to inception)

\- Interstellar (My favourite Nolan movie)

\- Deja Vu"
41665,"Just because I like a little shameless self-promotion: here are two Indy films I had a tiny bit to do with and have similar vibes. 

Ink (2009): https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1071804/

The Frame (2014): https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2567038/"
41666,"I love Winans' work! Cool, what did you do on those films?"
41667,"Hey, glad you have enjoyed those! I went to high school with him, and worked on some of his first independent films. For his later stuff, I did still photography, worked as a grip, and as an extra. Mainly just helping support a very long time friend who happens to make some cool movies"
41668,"Amazing! I would pay to be able to work with Winans 😆 

I regularly listen to his soundtracks as well, super talented guy! Did you work on *Spin* too? Probably my favourite short film of all time."
41669,"Jamin is the best. It has been fun to see him grow ever since doing stage plays together in school, to his first movie that I was in back in the day, to his work most recently. He is really a great person, does a lot of charitable work. 

I didn’t work on Spin. I was an extra in 11:59 and worked on one that was never released before Spin. 

I need to get in touch with him. I chatted with his wife over email a few years ago but haven’t talked since."
41670,thank you!! I’ll check those out :)
41671,"Hope you enjoy them. I think they are both on Amazon prime right now. They are lower budget, but Made well and have interesting stories"
41672,I really enjoyed The Adjustment Bureau and feel like it’s in that same realm
41673,"Triangle (2009)

Amazing movie"
41681,Tenet
41675,Anything nolan
41676,"It's not a movie, but in the 60s British series The Prisoner they already presented something similar."
72140,Shutter Island
41678,eXistenZ
51318,100%
41680,"Good Cronenberg flick.  Maybe Videodrome, too?"
41682,I was gonna say this just because Christopher Nolan directed it. I can honestly say that I have no idea what that movie is about. I gave up about 45 minutes in. Has a high rating on IMDB too.
41684,I’ve still never seen it LMAO
41685,Real fun begins in the second half. You missed that.
41686,"These are not exactly similar, but movies I would recommended if you liked inception. 

* Edge of Tomorrow
* Secret Life of Walter Mitty
* Cloud Atlas
* Upgrade
* Arrival
* Dark (TV series)"
41687,"I’ve actually watched a little bit of dark, it’s pretty great. Thank you!!"
41688,Also '12 monkeys'
41689,[Predestination - 2014](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/?ref_=vp_back)
41690,Extracted (2012)
71589,Predestination.
41692,"Coherance , triangle . these two movies will definitely blow your mind away"
41693,Thank you!! I’ll check them out. :)
41694,"Coma (recent, not the 80s one)"
41695,"Paprika , pretty sure Nolan drew some inspiration from the film , the elevator scene , the street mirror scene and the hallway scene ."
41696,The Thirteenth Floor (1999)
41697,Predestination go for it!!
41698,"Predestination
Memento
Butterfly effect
Eternal Sunshine of a spotless mind"
41699,I absolutely LOVE Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!
41700,"Pontypool. It’s not exactly like inception, but is an incredibly under-seen movie that people on this thread would enjoy. Mess with your head, great concept, great acting, so much fun."
41701,"Awesome, thank you!!!"

41707,"An 80s movie called Dreamscape - it’s literally about entering other peoples’ dreams

41712,I rented it off of amazon for.... 7 or 8 bucks i think? I think i also saw it was coming to one of the streaming services this summer
41713,"Watched it on HBOMAX yesterday.  Kept thinking about it so rewatched it today.  Honestly looking forward to watching it again. I thought it flowed really well, and damn I’ve never seen Robert Pattinson in anything but he was amazing.  Keep thinking the other guy was a like a young Denzel, then felt dumb when I looked him up on IMDB."
41714,"Couldnt have said it better myself, about both the movie and Robert Pattinson. I loved him in this movie and had ne er seen him in much else before. Had to watch it twice in less than 24 hours. Its not a perfect film by any stretch but it definitely hit me in a way that only Christopher Nolan seems capable of"
41715,"David and Brandon Cronenberg sci-fi catalog is worth visiting. Antiviral is great, so is possessor which someone mentioned earlier. Existenz was mentioned which is super mine bendy. Videodrome and scanners are great, so is the Fly. All sci fi laced with poetic philosophical ideas, similar to inception in spirit IMO."
41716,The Lathe Of Heaven
41717,Deja Vu?
