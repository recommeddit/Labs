42363,"[Stephen King disagrees with you](http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/stephen-king-approves-of-the-mists-new-ending/).

>Frank wrote a new ending that I loved. It is the most shocking ending ever and there should be a law passed stating that anybody who reveals the last 5 minutes of this film should be hung from their neck until dead."
42364,The Departed
42365,You mean The Depahted
42366,Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe go fuck yourself.
42367,Are you a cawp?
42368,Perfect Getaway - I had to rewatch it the second it finished. Ignore the IMDB rating & reviews - some people are just dumb.
42369,The Skeleton Key.
42370,10 Cloverfield Lane had me guessing practically the whole time. Then the end is just beautiful.
42371,"House of Games was pretty good. It's an older movie but still entertaining. I'm pretty sure Joe Mantegna is one of the main characters. 
It's not exactly a mindfuck, but it's pretty twisty."
71882,The Prestige
42373,"Memento, maybe?"
42374,Not maybe. Definitely.
42375,Is it good? http://imgur.com/G2hZtKz
42376,"Just finished this. It was definitely interesting but I didn't LOVE it. Seems more like fight club than the 3 in the title

Teddy though. That guy REEKED of sleezball...ness. Even just the accent."
42377,That anybody downvoted this is mind-blowing in and of itself.
42378,"I now have you tagged in RES as 'This is SonicBoom16, don't believe his lies'."
42379,"you, sir, are ahead of the game."
42380,:p
42381,nobody has?
42382,"It was at zero when I upvoted it, so I just figured."
42383,Get RES you can see the downvotes and upvotes of a comment
42384,"Zero is not a necessarily a downvote because of the vote fuzzing reddit does.

Next time, get some patience and wait until a comment is at -5 before saying anything about downvotes :/"
42385,"wasn't lack of patience, it was lack of knowledge. but otherwise, point taken."
42386,"Ah, sorry then.

You are one of the 10000 of today :D"
42387,This is reddit. People downvote for the hell of it
42388,"By mental movies do you mean.. ones that make you think? Or ones that ultimately try to throw you for a loop? Movies like Children of Men.. Minority Report.. Gattaca.. fall into the former category but not the latter. As a genre I'd call them ""smart"" sci-fi.

The latter category I'd call the ol' ""mindfuck"" genre. And I'd really recommend Pi if you haven't seen it. Also The Fountain, Daranofsky as well. And Fight Club which I imagine you've seen because I think everyone has. And Memento which is probably better than every movie I've mentioned thus far.

Edit: Oh and the Prestige. Another Chris Nolan film (Inception, and Memento)."
42389,All of the above. I especially like that the plots and all that actually involve people's minds
42390,'The Game' hooolyyyy shit that movie is THE mindfuck of all mindfucks.
42391,I would suggest watching it being slightly sleep deprived.  The first time I saw it was at 2 am and it completely freaked me out.
42392,I was sleep deprived when I saw Shutter Island in theaters and it had quite an effect
42393,I remember watching it twice in the theater and then reading that it was all just a huge elaborate way to get him to stop smoking.  My mind was blown.
42394,Did you just spoil a movie in a recommendation thread?
42395,Total Recall. I prefer the version with Ahnold.
42396,"Moon, Donnie Darko"
42397,"Donnie Darko was scary and unsettling as fuck. The descriptions just say ""He hallucinates a rabbit"" but that's not a fucking rabbit."
42399,"I think ""Source Code"" belongs here somewhere."
42400,Primer.
42401,fuck that movie. Too much work for a seriously convoluted plot.
42403,"Yep, I am surprised by how few have seen this film."
42404,"* Memento (Christopher Nolan)
* eXistenZ (David Cronenberg)
* Videodrome (David Cronenberg)
* Lost Highway (David Lynch)
* Jacob's Ladder (Adrian Lyne)"
42405,"I watched eXistenZ last night. A little rough, but constantly entertaining."
42406,The Butterfly Effect
42467,American Psycho
42408,"*Identity

*They Live

*Sixth Sense (honestly other works of M. Knight qualify as well)"
42409,Ill get downvoted but I liked The Village. Never expected th ending.
42410,"Agreed. The only thing I didn't like about The Village was M. Knight's cameo. Dude, you aren't Alfred Hitchcock."
42411,VHS 2
42412,"Wait, the similarities between Inception, Shutter Island and Sucker Punch, I get. But how are they related to Holy Grail and Airplane? Do you want satirical/parody comedy or cerebral action thriller?"
42413,"Oh, no, I'm looking for similar movies to the 3 in the title. Sorry for the confusion!"
42414,"No worries...well, lots of good ones have already been mentioned. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't much of an action thriller but definitely involves the mind and memories."
42415,Pink Floyd: The Wall
42416,On something it is.
42417,Try the anime Paprika and Millenial Princess
42418,Perfect blue as well.
42419,"Like anime? Maybe go back a bit further and watch *Uresei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer* directed by Oshi Mamoru (Ghost in the Shell, Twilight Q2) and written by Rumiko Takahashi (Ranma, Inu Yasha)-- it may help to watch an episode or two of the TV series to understand the characters. All available on youtube."
42420,Serial Experiments Lain. Not really a movie but a 13 episode anime.
42421,"Oh, that is a great suggestion!  It is a series that that keeps you thinking for years later."
42422,The Cell?
42423,"I just watched a film called Extracted which was a bit of a mind fuck. I'd also suggest Mr. Nobody. It's a little artsy but there is some real depth to it, a very thought provoking film. Primer is probably the pinnacle of mind fuck movies."
42424,"Hey, I have a similar taste in Movies like you :D Here are some that I watched already, with a Comment from me:
""Identity"" from 2003 with John Cusack and Ray Liotta. Quite good. Not perfect, but a good Film.
""Mindgame"", an Anime Movie from 2004. That Film is really crazy. In a awesome Way.
At this point I have to recommend the criminally overseen ""Mr.Nobody"" from  2009. It's one of my All-time Favourite Movies, with Jared Leto in the lead Role. Stunning and really, really complex. Sadly it flopped hard.
""Being John Malkovich"" from Spike Jonze. Didn't like it too much, but a decent Film.
Try ""Brazil"" from Terry Gilliam, an absolute Blast!
""Vanilla Sky"" with Tom Cruise. Pretty good Movie, the Endtwist is great.
As for Comedies like ""Airplane"", I would recommend you the ""Hot Shots"" Movies, with Charlie Sheen and ""Top Secret"" with Val Kilmer.  Comedy Gold! :D"
42425,Eraserhead
42426,"Synecdoche, NY. Mind-blowing concept plus one of Philip Seymour Hoffmann's best performances."
42427,Watchmen. The novel was better but Dr. Manhattan's soliloquy about life and time in the movie still had an everlasting impression.
42428,"those movies are not mental, those are easy ones, try Donnie Darko, Pi(kinda good, disappointed actually),  memento, fight club( pretty entertaining) , 12 monkeys, and the top, the best movie I`ve found, and I think I can`t possibly find a better one 'PRIMER"", you won`t even understand it the first 3 times, its only 70 minutes, it will turn your brain upside down, trust me...try to stay away from Hollywood if you like these kind of movies, they make films for lazy people that dont wanna think while watching a movie"
42429,Have you seen *A Beautiful Mind*? I feel like that it's a little more somber but would fit well with the theme.
42430,"I liked the **Butterfly Effect** a lot.. as long as we're talking about the director's cut with the good ending..  
  
I enjoyed a little low budget flick called **Ink**..  
  
Would you put **Oldboy** in there?  
  
**Mulholland Drive** maybe..  
  
**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind**"
42432,Possibly more Upstream Color than Primer even.
42433,"Naked Lunch, Solaris (either version), Lost Highway, and the first ""mental"" movie The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari."
42434,You watched the whole thing?? Im FREEEE!
42435,">However I don't know what keyword(s) to search for when looking for other movies like them

Psychological? I think that may be what you're looking for.

And if you want a movie that that throws a mindfuck at you, I'd recommend Donnie Darko and The Book of Eli.
As for something that involves the human mind, I'm not recalling any movies, but I'd recommend Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime). There's a lot of insight into the main character's inner conflicts."
42436,you should watch Pan's Labyrinth
42437,Funny games. I've only seen the 1997 version but the 2008 is also supposed to be good too.
42438,"Primer , code 46, man from earth"
42439,"Man from Earth is a great Film! Not sure if it fits here, though."
42441,also known as an hour and a half of cringing...good movie though
42443,Waking life.
42444,Moon (2007)-Directed by Jesus Winding-Nolantino
42445,Trance
71105,Enemy.
42447,Enemy
42448,Limitless
42449,Not sure if Sucker Punch should be compared to good movies in general.
42450,"I really really liked Sucker Punch, however that probably has to do with the fact that I'm a big gamer/game developer, and imo it would've made a lot more sense as a video game rather than a movie."
42451,"[YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT ""SUCKER PUNCH"" PART 1 (The Big Picture) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gXir4Pu0f0)


[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds7w5fWLfPI)



tl;dw-  Basically, 95% of people ""didn't get""  Sucker Punch."
42452,"Sucker punch is a giant piece of shit. A big idea director who can't execute a movie with depth on any level without making it boring, dry, and all around uninteresting disaster. Man of Steel too.

Tl:dr Snyder is a hack for babies"
42453,"So you say the movie was terrible but your only reason is because you didn't like it. I personally don't like pop music but that doesn't mean it's shit (although I personally think it is). Everyone has different tastes. 
Now if you wanna list actual reasons then go for it, but the difference  between stating a fact that something is shit, and an opinion that ""I think"" something is shit, is that there are unarguable flaws with the thing that make it terrible."
42454,"I think I wrote something to the effect of his attempt at depth made it boring, dry, and all around uninteresting, like his other shit movies.

 I was falling asleep during the train robot fight, in theaters. So were my buddies. Sure you might like It, you know, if you are drunk maybe"
42456,"scenes that take place ""in the mind""."
42457,Hot Shots part deux
42459,Nolan ripped off so many ideas and visuals from Paprika to make the inferior Inception.
42460,Nolan pitched Inception to WB 6 years before Paprika came out.
42463,Excellent movie. Jack blacks character cracks me the fuck up.
42465,"Paprika

Perfect Blue"
42466,"- Pi
- Following
- Source Code
- Moon
- Memento
- The Machinist"
42468,Total Recall
42469,Upstream colour
42470,Mr Nobody.
42471,Mr.Nobody.
70973,Arrival
42474,"Have you checked out Westworld? Christopher Nolan's brother directs it and it is an absolutely mindfuck of a show. Makes you question the nature of your reality. Take in all the details and try to follow along the best you can lol.

Black Mirror is another great psy-fi show. That I couldn't recommend more. White Christmas is a mindfucker. Hang The DJ is another that stands out in memory."
42475,"Think I watched half of the first episode with a friend but then I had to leave the house and never watched it again. 
Totally gonna start watching it in the next few days"
42476,Westworld is definitely a show to fully dive into. Many story lines and clues but the show is a wild ride! Season One is especially excellent.
42477,Other nolan movies
42478,The Departed is on Netflix now. Must watch IMO
42479,"yes great movie by martin scorsese with leonardo dicaprio and matt damon

the ending >! is so unexpected tho, it definitely caught me off guard !<"
42480,I liked the original as much as the Scorsese one.
42481,"Mindhunter although it was not renewed. I really liked Narcos & Breaking Bad. And if you have access to HBO - Mare of Easttown

Edit. Oops. Looks like there might be a new season of Mindhunter!"
42482,I saw something as of July 23 that said Mindhunter was back on. Did something come out later than that saying no again?
42483,"Hey, that’s exciting news, thanks for the update! I had no idea."
42484,It’s not coming back
42485,Damnit
42486,Mindhunter wasn't renewed??? 😭😭
42487,I think Fincher had other projects he wanted to do more
42488,"The first season was so good. The second, not so much as it felt (and was) unfinished IMO :("
42489,"Not sure about best of all time, but the Killing is a quality TV series."
42490,Absolutely loved this!!
42491,No where to be found on Netflix anymore. Why do they do this. With so much mediocre crap on the site??
42492,It’s on Hulu if you have it.
42493,"The Departed, one of the greatest movies of all time imo."
42494,"Heat, the tension between Pacino and De Niro is fantastic. Great return performance from Val Kilmer. Great all around movie."
42495,Cannot upvote enough.  Why don’t they make em like this any more?
42496,what is a return performance?
42497,"Val had dropped off the stage. Similar to Trevolta and pulp fiction. I think Heat gave Val a shot at lead that he was not getting before.  And his performance boosted that. He plays Elvis in True Romance but if you’re not paying attention, you don’t even realize it’s him."
42498,"Love crime dramas!

Check these ones out (you've probably seen the top ones, but I'll list them anyways).

42499,Great tips on there mate. I just saw The Night of a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing!
42500,Nice! I loved The Night Of as well :)
42501,"Torturro was great but just thinking about, that James Gandolfini was supposed to play John Stone made me sad!"
42502,Oh wow that's interesting. I feel like Torturro is able to pull off that kind of weird vibe more than James Gandolfini would have. Maybe his image from the Sopranos is too engrained in me haha.
42503,"Definitely would have been a different energy but Gandolfini would have made it his own. If you haven't seen it, watch Enough Said with Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfus. It's a romantic dramedy about middle-aged divorcees and shows that Gandolfini is more than Tony Soprano and it's a nice movie."
42504,Will do! Added to my list. Thanks for the rec :)
42505,This is the best and most complete list I've ever seen. I would add The Bodyguard.
42506,Oh yeah! Let me add that one also. Good suggestion!
42507,Jackpot!  Thank you!
42508,The Sinner.. that's a hell of a show. Just started the third part today.
42509,"Yeah it's good. I liked the first season the most. Second season was solid. Third season was not bad, but imo was the worst one so far. Let me know what you think when you finish it!"
42511,"I don't recall if it's still on Netflix or if BBC took it back, but the Sherlock Holmes with Martin Freeman and Bendadit Cucumberpatch was amazing. Short seasons, super long episodes, but could be a good binge for a week/weekend."
42512,"Bendadit Cucumberpatch 😂😂😂 But I have to agree, it's a really good tv show!!"
42513,Benadryl Conundrumlatch
42515,The most perfect season I've ever seen. Not a mediocre minute in the whole season
42516,Followed up the next season by the most laughable garbage since The Producers.  What. The. Fuck.
42517,"I’m a Season 2 apologist.  I don’t think it was actually bad, it just paled by comparison to Season 1.  And, let’s be honest, what wouldn’t?"
42518,"Agreed. Thought Farrel & Kitch performances were great. Everything except the finale, which was godawful nonsense."
42519,"Agree. It was also better than S3, IMO."
42520,Season 3 is ok doe
42521,"SUCH a awful follow up!!! I mean, why bother ffs?"
42522,"That's pretty hyperbolic. Season 2 was fairly decent and had a very tough act to follow, and would've been fine as a standalone show. If season 2 had came out before season 1, there would've been very little criticisms at all and just praises for how a good show got even better."
42523,"I just finished watching Giri/Haji - a crime/yakuza drama set in Tokyo and London. It's only 8 one hour episodes, but very well done. A good bit of the dialog is in Japanese with English subtitles."
42524,"Mare of easttown was great but not on Netflix. 

Zodiac 

Prisoners"
42525,"Oh man those are 11/10, great taste. I saw Prisoners earlier this year, holy shit that was good."
42526,It's a great movie with amazing performances all around. Denis Villeneuve is a fantastic director!
42527,"Agreed, so excited for Dune."
42528,Broad church
42529,Also Justified is a good series
71047,Chinatown
42531,"The Wire HBO Max is great, especially Season 1,3"
42589,The Fall
42533,The Fall is incredibly well done. But it literally took me three years to be able to watch another serial killer show after that. It's extremely heavy/disturbing so just make sure you're prepared.
42534,Totally agree with you! Phenomenal acting & writting. I find that alot of British shows are more interesting..
42535,"The Wire
Bosch
The Shield
Sopranos"
42536,"All of these are phenomenal shows. Just a heads up, though, that none of them
 are on netflix.

The wire = HBOMax

Bosch = Amazon prime

The Shield = Hulu

The Sopranos = HBOMax"
42537,Add Luther for the fab five
42538,It wasn’t for me.
42539,"I’ll add two Billy Bobs:
Fargo
Goliath"
42540,I am still scarred from The Kroft Supershow’s cameo on season 2 Goliath.
42541,Ozark
42542,Peaky Blinders and Ozark
42543,"Mindhunter on netflix. 
The bridge/bron - not sure what its on though."
42544,Apparently Homocide: Life on the Streets doesn't air on any streaming services.  :(
42545,Peaky blinders
42546,Dexter!!
42547,"The Wire, Narcos and Animal Kingdom."
42548,"Mindhunter , The Sinner"
42549,"""Dr. Death"" on Peacock is a new must-watch miniseries."
42550,My wife just finished it (I watched the first two episodes and liked it...she just has more time).  She loves it.  It made me not ever want to go to the doctor again.
42551,"If you want to watch an excellent movie I suggest you ¨36 Quai des Orfèvres¨ It´s a fantastic   French movie partially inspired by actual facts. It´s not the usual crime movie. It´s about a competition between two French cops seeking promotion as Head of the Parisian Criminal Investigation Department (the title is the address of that Department). This competition  becomes increasingly ruthless and blurs the usual lines of morality involving all the Department, until it is really difficult to distinguish the good and the bad guys. Besides, also the setting (the Parisian criminal underworld) is very intriguing. Finally, the director is a former cop (so he knows that environment)."
71863,The usual suspects
42553,"If you don't mind it a bit dated, 'Columbo' is still just as good as it ever was. The best cat and mouse one out there.

Edit: Sorry...this is ***not*** on Netflix."
42554,"The Sinner. The perfect binge watching show. Every episode they give you a little more information on the crime and you just HAVE to watch the next episode to hear what plays out. Bill Pullman is phenomenal as the fucked up, retired cop who just can't retire."
42555,"What did you think of S3? Great show, but I thought the first two seasons were much stronger."
42556,Totally agree! Not as good as the first 2 seasons
42557,"The fall, broadchurch, mindhunter."
42558,Did you watch the new Perry Mason yet?
42559,"If you have access to HBO max, I would recommend this too. I can't wait for season 2."
42560,Same.  Season 1 was fantastic!
42561,"Movie - Reservoir Dogs
Series - Breaking Bad"
42562,The People vrs OJ Simpson - Netflix
42563,I always forget about this one but it was quite good!
42564,Unbelievable on netflix
42565,Bosch!!!
42566,Money heist or Narcos. Money heist is about a meticulously planned heist on the royal mint of Spain and narcos is the true story of Pablo Escobar
42567,"Revenge and Killing Eve. They’re not on netflix anymore though, but Hulu."
42568,"Without a doubt: Chicago PD.

Believable characters and situations. Fully fleshed out characters. No bullshit storylines. 

Give it a try. Shit gets real on the first episode.

Edit: not on Netflix."
42569,You might like Southland. Great but forgotten cop show with the guy from the OC and Gotham.
42570,"Voight is da bomb!!! What a hard ass.
Chicago PD is a great show, the writting, the actors, the violence... Love it all!"
42642,Broadchurch
42572,"Mare of east town, true detective, the wire."
42573,"Mare of East Town was a great show. Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses.

I am one of the very few that didnt get into The Wire. I watched 2 episodes & that was enough.
But i do love Dominic West (the Affair) that's why i went to the Wire."
42574,"True it was a great show, and you should give The wire your time. There's some great acting involved and it feels real. Give it a chance."
42575,Gomorrah is up there
42576,Heat by Michael Mann starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. The movie didn't do that well but I loved it. You can also see Collateral.
42577,"I just watched Heat again last week. I agree with you, i think it was a great movie. Great cast."
42578,"The Shield and Breaking Bad really stuck with me. 

I couldn't get into The Wire, though I really tried.
It is so popular that I feel strange not liking it. lol."
42579,It took me 4-5 episodes to get into The Wire but I am glad I stuck with it because it is really an incredible series.
42580,"Yes i totally agree with you. I found the Wire boring. I didnt make it past the 2nd episode.
If a show/book takes too long to get into, i move along!!"
42581,Banshee on HBO max
42582,one i just finished watching on Netflix is Ripper Street. I think it's as good as Peaky Blinders
42782,Happy Valley
42584,The Tunnel and Rogue on Amazon Prime
42585,"I had to come back to edit this, as i was thinking of so many great shows i have seen!! 

My all time favourites are
Gangs of London  10/10 brutal fighting scenes
& Breaking Bad. Ive watched it numberous times. 
Power another 10!
-
Kirk Sutter in my opinion is an amazing creative writter. I love the Sons Of Anarchy & Mayans MC (is a spin off of SOA)
-
Nurse Jackie
McMafia 
Morning Show
Big Little Lies
Your Honor - 2021 Brian Cranson (there are a few shows with the same name)
Chicago Fire 
Chicago PD, almost as good as NYPD Blue 

Im currently watching Snowfall. Excellent show, About the drug world in the 80's in LA.
 Enjoy😉"
42586,"Never heard of gangs of london until now. I’m a big fan of high quality series (the wire, saul, narcos, breaking bad) and usually can’t get through any that are low caliber. Will def try this one out!"
42587,there's an entire section on r/ForeignTvShows of crime dramas and some users left lists of their own of their favorites!
42588,"Looks like no one has said Hannibal for some ungodly reason. So yeah;

Hannibal

Prodigal Son"
42590,"Castle --- maybe.  I find myself drawn to it.  I liked it when it was on in broadcast initially.  Now, stuck mostly alone during this pandemic, and teleworking, and putting the tv on in the background to break the dead silence in my apartment or to block out the dork above me constantly banging around with his weightlifting at every hour, but I've run out of stuff.  So Castle is on Lifetime now.

I still enjoy it, but it's so predictable.  And half the episodes almost the same exact method of finding the killer.  They get a picture of the killer searching the traffic cameras, they track his credit card or phone records, they get someone to confess to one of the smaller crimes that was key in the string of events leading up to the murder, but they vehemently deny they murdered anyone.  This person then says ""I want to see a lawyer.""  And Beckett rolls her eyes, like ""ah, shit, I almost had him ready to admit the murder, but he came up with the clever idea to ask for a lawyer.""  But Beckett books him anyway.  Oh, but wait, there is still 12 minutes left.  So they are back to normal life and something happens and Castle stands up straight like he's being shocked and he realizes the clue that they had missed to date but had been right in front of them the whole time.  So they cut to a scene where they go and talk to the actual murderer as if they are just coming to give them an update, then they acuse them, the killer keeps denying, they show them the physical evidence, the killer says ""this is silly, you will never be able to prove it.""  Then, they show their final piece of evidence, and then the killer finally admits it and explains why they had to do it, conveniently laying out all the rest of the info that the prosecutor will need to solidify a conviction.

I doubt that last part ever happens, but I do wonder.  Maybe they do try to lay out their theory to the accused murderer so that the murderer does give up all the details that they have had on their chest since the killing and the cops are hoping they will have a complete confession then... who knows.  But it's funny that no matter what, almost every case follows that exact same pattern on Castle."
42591,Yup 👆
42592,"The Fall.

Possibly my favorite detective thriller ever."
42593,Definitely! I second this.
42594,"Thirded!

Great show"
42595,"The Fall is so fucking good. Incredible acting and such a great twist on the classic detective show. I’ve seen almost every show on the above list, and this show sticks with me more than any other - I find myself thinking about it all time. Watch it!"
42596,"All I gotta say is this. Remember the scene with the killer and Stella? Where they exchange chilling diologue. End of season 2 maybe? 

That may be the some best writing and acting I’ve seen in television. They did such a great job making a realistic and terrifying psychopath. So many layers to that character."
42597,"Came here to say this, I love this show"
42598,"Thanks for this recommendation! What a fantastic show. 

I’m surprised how emotionally charged the last season is or maybe it was just my reaction. 

I love Anderson’s character... such a strong female lead. The writing, her lines especially, are so profound."
42599,"Just want to say that after reading this I’m two episodes in and really enjoying this show, so thanks!"
42601,"Was coming here to say this. Easily one of my favorites I’ve watched. 

Would also highly recommend Bletchley Circle"
42602,The sinner
42603,Way better than I expected
42604,Best series on Netflix
42605,Altered Carbon
42606,I've got to finish this one.
42607,"No brainer, it’s a great futuristic show."
42608,"River.  Hinterland.   Shetland.

It's a movie, but you might enjoy Wind River."
42609,Wind River!? Was Sofa King good.
42610,"I don't think it's that. These are the similar British series, all really good."
42611,River is my all-time favorite.
42612,That twist in the first episode just blew my mind. Literally.
42613,Twin Peaks. It’s a cult classic. It’s very unique so don’t expect it to be like anything else you’ve seen.
42614,"Twin Peaks is great. It's so hard to get anybody to watch it though since it's so old.

I'd also recommend Jack Taylor and I think Bloodlines could fit in this category too.

Also, Supernatural could be considered a detective show too and it is far better than any CW show has a right to be. I expected to hate it, but I'm on season 5 now and it's still all good so far."
42615,"The thing about Twin Peaks is that even though it's old, it's not as old as it looks because it was intentionally campy. I think more people would be receptive to it if they went into it with that knowledge."
42616,"Season 5? Stop when that season is over. It's a great, well written show that goes off the ledge when he goes in the box."
42617,"Ah really? Damn shame, but I should've known better than to think a show could stay good for 14+ seasons"
42618,Form your own opinion. I absolutely love Supernatural and never once lost interest. So I am looking forward (though saddened too) to watching the final season (15).
42619,Maybe I just had high hopes after the strong start. Watch and report back!
42620,That’s such a weird reason not to watch something imo. Some of the best film and TV is very old. Plus it’s not that old.
42621,"I know it's not that old and it has aged very well, but I've still had people tell me they don't want to watch some older show when there's new stuff out. I don't understand it either"
42622,That’s fucky. Guess those people will just miss out on some amazing art!
42623,"Watched it and love it, just I thought that it isn't quite the same genre, that's why I didn't add it to watched list."
42625,I second Marcella
42626,try Wallander. swedish detective series. pretty good imo.
42628,Broadchurch for sure
42629,First season was pretty good. When it became about the stalker boyfriend it turned into a soap opera
42630,Not on Netflix but Killing Eve is great
42631,AMAZING show!!!!!
42632,"Maybe more of a mystery/puzzle than a crime series, but Dark is fantastic. Has some elements of what you listed here. Involves people going missing and there are detectives on the case."
42633,Yes! I came here to suggest Dark. And this is the perfect time to start because season 2 is coming out this month.
42634,The Wire
42635,"Person of Interest is a detective series, in a way.  It starts fairly straight-forward and develops, over 5 seasons, in to one of the greatest shows I have ever watched.  Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."
42636,"Spoiler Alert
You will be."
42637,"The only people I know who were disappointed by POI ore people who gave up in the first season, before it hit its stride.  Season 1 is a little ""procedural"", but in season two they start heading in to the big story and it becomes a thing of beauty.

Not saying there aren't people that don't like it, just saying I don't know any of them."
42638,So would it be safe to just jump into season 2?
42639,"Season 1 isn't bad, just a different feel than the other seasons.  It focuses more on the ""case of the week"" and less on the overall story that they are trying to tell.  The problem with skipping season 1 is that it has a lot of character stuff that is important in later seasons."
42640,"I’ll give it a shot, thanks."
42641,"It is in my opinion, and many others, one of the best ""secret"" sci-fi shows in a very long time."
42643,This is another great one
42644,Just finished this and the first and second season were spectacular
42645,Bodyguard with Richard Madden.
42646,Yes I agree.
42647,"Not on Netflix but Hannibal (the tv series). It’s on prime, if that helps. I absolutely loved it"
42648,I thought of this too per what they are looking for..its dark that's for sure..creeped me out.
42649,Death in Paradise and Longmire
42650,Longmire underrated. Very pleasant watching
42651,"Death in Paradise has a much different feel than those OP mentioned. Lighter overall, with more comedy and romance, and much more of a procedural. Personally I really enjoy it - like taking a short vacation to a beautiful Caribbean island for an hour."
42652,Ripper Street.  About a couple detectives in Victorian London a year or two after the Jack the Ripper attacks.  Fun show.  Has Bronn from Game of Thrones as one of the main actors.
42653,Midsomer murders
42654,So good.
42655,The Killing is a really good one.
42656,The Killing!
42657,Death Note. For the first viewing you never know what’s going to happen.

42659,"Seconding Inspector Lewis, especially since OP mentioned Enveavour."
42660,I’ve watched Foyle’s War twice it’s so good if you like WWII stuff
42661,Is there anywhere to stream A Touch of Frost? I want to rewatch - I watched it initially back when Bravo still aired decent shows but can't find it anywhere.
42662,"US Siri search came up with britbox 

https://www.britbox.com/us/"
42663,"Everybody mentioned all the great shows, my recommendation is not on Netflix, but Sharp Objects is something great, Amy Adams and Patricia Clarkson are always spectacular but newcomer Eliza Scanlen is phenomenal, we will watch her career with great interest."
42664,Line of duty is fantastic
42665,Seconding Line of Duty! I’ve watched the first four seasons in about a week and a half. Absolutely fantastic!
42666,Yes! I was checking to see if anyone else had mentioned this one. It's soooo good!!
42667,"Sherlock, Peaky Blinders, Lucifer

We made a Chrome Extension: [Trim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trim/lpgajkhkagnpdjklmpgjeplmgffnhhjj). You can find all good movies on Netflix based on their IMDB ratings"
42668,The killing
42669,"Bosch. They don't get any better. There are 5 seasons for you to watch.

Edut: sorry, this is on Amazon Prime Video"
42670,"Hannibal, The Fall, The Break, The Sinner. And for a movie, Prisoners if it's available on one of your services."
42671,"Bosch, Spiral - the one in French is excellent. And Billy Bob Thornton’s show Goliath."
42673,Colombo is my all time favorite!
42674,Longmire
42675,Jessica Jones
42676,Great show. Would def recommend this one!
42677,Absolutely loved this show
42678,Hotel Beau Sejour!    It seems perfect for you!
42679,"Alienist is great, unfortunately there is only one season"
42680,"There’s a French one, I believe it’s called The Frozen Dead (Glacé)... and another called The Chalet which I enjoyed"
42681,Sherlock Holmes?
42682,Psych it’s on Prime though. It’s a comical defective show and one of my all time faves.
