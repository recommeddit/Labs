71872,Game over
71873,My favorite line in that entire film. Tobin Bell was the best actor in that movie and the best part was him simply getting up off the floor.
71874,That weird neck spasm thing he does creeps me out.
71875,What was the obvious way you thought it would end?
71876,"The movie made it look so damn obvious that Zepp was going to be the killer.  Like, when he showed up I was like ""Yeah, that's the killer right there"".  Then the rest of the film happens, yeah it turned out Zepp locked and chained them up in that bathroom, then out of nowhere Adam finds his tape recorder and mind blown.

I literally sat there staring at the credits (and listening to Adam's howling) with my eyes wide open and jaw open."
71877,"Yep, I thought I had just seen one of the most original movies ever after it was over. Well done start to finish and it was low-budget, yet felt like a much greater effort."
71878,Hate the sequels were a parody of the first
71879,Give any movie/music/game series enough time and it'll become self-parody.
71880,"The Game, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174/)"
71881,"Yes! Definitely a movie you should watch ""blind."" No trailers, no synopses."
71883,"The best part is that we’re told about the twist right away and don’t even realize it. 

“Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled.”"
71884,Not to mention how the bird trick works in the beginning.
71885,I found this the most clever thing about the movie. Only realized it the second time I watched it.
71886,"Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit... One dies in a cage, and the other is free.

Well fuck me with a rusty cactus and call me retarded, how did i just got that?"
71887,The kid tells us too when he sees the bird trick and says that’s his brother
71888,Explains both tricks in one scene.
71889,"And the main character didn't figure out the secret in the end. He literally said ""every night I went into the cage with fear, not knowing if I will end up in the tank or appear back on the stage"". He thought its 50/50 chance, without knowing that he ALWAYS end up in the tank and drowned!"
71890,"Not to mention he didn't need to kill the copies, just make one and share the prestige.  Like Christian Bale's character(s) did."
71891,Jesus Christ. Why didn't I ever think about that? That makes everything so much worse.
71892,"He didn't trust himself and wasnt able to commit to the trick, that's why when he did it for the first time he shot his clone. The whole film is about commitment and dedication. Remember the scene with the old man and the fish bowl? They had a discussion about how his funny walk with the walking stick allowed him to pull off holding the fish bowl between his legs and he couldnt comprehend how someone could commit to a trick so hard that they made it their entire life and completely ruled it out as an option."
71894,"He may have run the risk of running into another Cutter style situation (was that the actors name?). Angiers past experience was that he was never the man on the stage, never the prestige, and never experienced that applause first hand because he was hidden underneath. He wants to be the man on the stage in order to a) be the prestige and b) beat Borden at his own trick. 

Two Angiers running around could have potentially ruined their own lives. Borden and Fallon have a life long commitment to their art, which Angier (and therefore his exact duplicate) cannot and will not understand. They would fight and argue just as before as he and Cutter did. This is why he has a gun during his first experiment. 

The aspect I LOVE about this is what Angier says toward the end - not knowing if he's on stage or the man in the box. He doesn't know either, so in theory the ""original"" Angier could have been that first copy that was shot dead..."
71895,I thought he had to kill the copies every show to make sure Bordon would be framed for his murder once he showed up.
71896,"It always bugged me that he chose DROWNING as his preferred method... seems like there are more efficient/less painful ways to do it, not even bringing in the fact that he keeps the tanks with all the bodies afterwards. Why?"
71897,"An old sailor told me once, ""it was like going home.""

The parallel to his wife's death, and the reassurance from Cutter that it was painless at her funeral. Only years later does he rectify that by saying that drowning was, agony."
71898,"I forgot if it is mentioned in the film or is this my own interpretation, but he did it to experience how his wife felt when she drowned in the act at the beginning of the film. Also he didn't know if drowning is painful because his engineer lied and told him drowning feels like ""going home"" instead of being ""agony"". So he didn't know he was subjecting his copies or him to suffering. 

As for the bodies, I feel that he wanted to ""end it all"" after the 100 days of limited performance so he doesn't feel that need to dispose of the bodies. After his wife died, the only purpose of his life is to figure out The Professor's secret so that he can destroy him. He doesn't care about anything else, not even the real secret."
71899,"YES 

When we watched it in Lang I was a little confused and after the reveal I was just shook

Like stare-at-the-screen-mouth-open type of shook and it took me a good sec to process it 

Then we compared it to Julias Caesar and Batman so that was fun"
71900,"""The Others"" is an underrated mind-fuck movie.

1st place has to go to Sixth Sense though. That was something else."
71902,">>!The noise that wakes Kidman up at the beginning is a gunshot!<

What does that imply? Been awhile since I've seen it."
71904,>!The Mom shooting herself.!<
71905,One of the movies I was thinking of myself! One of my favorite movies when I was little
71906,This movie remains on my top 10 list to this day. One of my absolute favorites. It’s one of those that I wish I could go back and rewatch for the first time again.
71907,Threat Level Midnight. The president turning out to be evil just completely blew my mind.
71908,Then Michael Scarn forgot he was evil and joined him for another mission in a still unreleased sequel.
71909,"A small lapse in judgment, no biggie"
71910,And that’s how you do the Scarn
71911,"If doing the Scarn is gay, then I’m the biggest queer on Earth!"
71912,For a second I thought you actually spoiled an actual movie.  Then I realized I'm just out of the loop.
71914,This would be top if enough people had seen it. Mind blowing twist.
71916,Surprised I had to go this far down. First time I saw that my mind was blown.
71917,Because you're not supposed to talk about it
71918,Witness for the Prosecution
71919,Older movies like this don't get the appreciation they deserve.  Have my upvote.
71921,"Saw a movie on Netflix a while ago, What Happened to Monday? - I think that was the title, everythung about the end made me go wtf? so hard.."
71922,12 monkeys.
71925,That movie gives a brand new meaning to “go fuck yourself”.
71926,"Time travel is one of my favourite tropes. If you enjoyed Predestination, you should check out Timecrimes (Los Cronocrimenes)"
71927,Arlington Road. Very rare a movie ends like that.
71928,Everyones meant to be here....  but you.
71929,"White Christmas from black mirror, i count that shit as a movie"
71931,"I’m usually pretty good at ruining/predicting endings (for myself). 

The whole time you’re watching “Shut up and Dance”, you’re like who gives a shit if someone >!caught you masturbating on camera, why is this kid freaking out? Then you see the twist that he’s a pedophile. Oooh yeah that’s why. It gets even creepier when you rewatch it and he looks at the little girl!<"
71932,"Fallen was pretty good and totally unexpected.  It doesn’t get as much play as the Sixth Sense, but I’d argue the ending is just as good."
71933,"Tiiiiiime, is on my side...

Yes it is..."
71934,"Is that the one that opens with ""Let me tell you about the time I almost died.""?"
71935,Arrival. Such a good twist on a somewhat overdone Syfi plot
71936,Came here looking for this one. Great movie
71937,"Expected nothing from the movie and came out of the theatre amazed. 

Doesnt have as much rewatch potential compared to predestination, primer or prestige, but it's still an amazing film."
71938,"I have seen Arrival about 6 times now and it gets better with each run. The movie is so perfect, the flow, the music, the pictures, it is like a 2 hour meditation. Even if the movie plot would be absolute shit, it would still be worth watching just due to the cinematogrophy."
71939,"Yes! It's so beautiful, clever, and moving. The twist is very nice but it's not like it's the only good thing about the movie."
71940,I don't understand the ending. What does she say to the general?
71941,She repeated the general's dead wife's last words.
71942,">Abbott is death process.

:("
71943,Arrival is a wonderful film and I think Denis Villeneuve is one of the most exciting filmmakers around atm.
71944,*Ocean's 11*. The solution for how they got the money out of the casino was pretty unexpected.
71945,I loved Oceans Twelve’s twist simply because the twist makes the second half of the film completely irrelevant and they’re only doing it to put on a show.
71946,"This exactly. The entire ""heist"" is just for show.  I loved that."
71947,"People forget the now well-known (so I am probably not spoiling it for anyone) shower scene in Psycho was a massive twist when the movie first came out.  It's a twist then that really made the movie a hit, but has little affect on us now because everyone knows its going to happen before they see the movie."
71948,Ex machina
71949,"I also loved this movie because of its clean, modern aesthetic contrasted with the Norwegian landscape. Very pleasing to my eyeballs"
71950,That guy’s house tho... oof the dream right there
71951,"The house in Ex Machina is actually a hotel; a stay in 2019 (they close December 1 for the rest of 2018) will cost you \~$360 USD a night for a landscape view.

[http://www.juvet.com/en](http://www.juvet.com/en)"
71952,"That was one of the few films that had my jaw on the ground and left me stunned silent at the end of it. Not just the twist, but how close it could be to reality in the near future"
71953,Unbreakable
71954,Hot Fuzz
71955,"He’s fuck ugly. 

But why would he hide his face like that?

Cuz he knows he fuck ugly."
71956,For the greatuh good!
71957,Crusty jugglers
71958,"Not a movie but The Good Place has some fantastic twists.

Also the Truman Show has one of the most disturbing twists ever. 

Most Nolan movies get pretty twisty and most people like The Prestige but I always found Memento's twist better."
71959,"I’m confused, genuine question: what would you say is the twist in The Truman Show? I feel like the concept of where he’s at and what’s going on is laid out pretty direct from the beginning. But I haven’t seen it in a while."
71960,Yeah it has some fantastic twist. Such a good show. And Kristin bell does an excellent job acting shocked and fake cussing
71961,The Good Place is such a great show!
71962,Fork yea it is
71963,Gone girl.
71964,"I actually saw a great movie detail recently where in the shot of her writing in her diary you can see her using multiple pens (all placed next to her journal) which at first glance just looks like general desk clutter, but after learning the twist was really fucking cool. Thought that was pretty damn neat"
71965,"you could share that on r/MovieDetails, they love stuff like that :) I would, but I don't want to steal your karma"
71966,The mist
71967,"It seems almost cliche now, but people lost their shit when The Crying Game came out. I remember ads specifically warning people who had seen it not to ruin it for others."
71968,The Uninvited
71969,the orphanage
71970,Still one of the most beautifully sad endings of all time.
71971,"In Infinity War I honestly didn’t expect Thanos to win, despite him being like a literal god I was so numb to the status quo I didn’t even consider him winning."
71972,"Imagine being a kid or a moviegoer that had no real idea about the comics or much about thanos or infinity war beyond it being an avengers movie. That twist is hella shocking then isn’t it! 

For this generation of kids this is their mufasa moment, the toys in the garbage disposal moment, their ash ketchum dying moment. This shit is traumatising in the best way!"
71973,"My best friend’s son went to the movie dressed as Spider-Man...

For his birthday, my friend got his son a Spider-Man action figure box with ashes inside."
71974,I wish I could see his face when he open the box and see the ashes.
71975,"Am I the only one who think Thanos is going to win in the first part? 

I mean, they told us that the Avengers Infinity War will divided into 2 parts so of course that the heroes aren't going to win in the first. I just didn't expect that the heroes will turn into dusts at the end of it."
71976,"I thought it was going to be a cliffhanger type of thing. I didnt expect anyone to win yet. I thought it was going to be some people died, they fought his followers for a long time while he is still trying to find some stones, the movie ends with him finding out that the mindstone is with vision, and everyone is on their way to where vision is. They prepare for the big fight with thanos afterwards."
71977,I was so convinced that Thanos wasn't going to win that when he snapped his fingers and went into the soul stone I though ohh so all that was part of the test to see his worthiness
71978,"Na you definitely weren’t the only one, it’s just that me and I’m sure some other movie go-ers didn’t pay attention to that kinda stuff and assumed status quo was god."
71979,"Thanos snapping his fingers and wiping out half the life in the universe is the biggest part of the Infinity Gauntlet comic event so I know that was going to happen.

What I did not expect was a pile of major characters (like the entire GOTG except for Rocket Raccoon) to be casualties of the film.  Even the comic series kept a lot of the major heroes alive after the snap."
71981,"Old Boy (Korean version) 
Daayyyuuummm"
71982,doesn't matter; had sex
71983,Coco !!
71984,"Great twist, coupled with colossal bawling from all the feels!!!"
71985,I saw the twist coming a mile away. Still made me bawl.
71986,"Hell yeah, that was a great movie!!! Exceeded my expectations"
71988,"Predestination. It's a great film that is very underrated, imo."
71990,"Hot Fuzz. The amount of set up is astounding, and the more times I watch it the more I realize they blatantly throw clues in your face.

&#x200B;

""A GREAT BIG BUSHY BEARD!"""
71991,El Orfanato
71992,Get Out.
71993,"Honestly, same. I was impressed with the way you thought you knew what the twist was right up until they showed all the cards...at which point you realize, ""Oh, no, this is much worse!"""
71994,"Just watched for my second time, partners first.

She said exactly that."
71995,Sorry Dad.. I thought I could stay longer
71996,Split.
71997,Interstellar. It changed my perspective on movies.
71998,"Interstellar is the craziest mind fuck of a movie start to finish, almost entirely from all the space stuff but that last 20 minutes was intense"
71999,"‘Arrival’ has one of the smartest twists I’ve ever seen in a film. A brilliant, underrated gem."
72000,Abre Los Ojos
72001,triangle
72003,Sorry to Bother You. Mind fucked for days after watching it
72004,"Yeah, that twist just came out of fucking nowhere."
72005,"This is also on Hulu for everyone curious. 

I highly recommend it. Fantastic cast, and breaks the mold in so many ways."
72007,8 years later and I think I'm probably still confused by that movie.
72008,"First off, Michael Caine never goes into the dream world. If he's in a scene, it's reality.

The idea of inception is to implant an idea so deep in someone's subconscious that they think it's their own idea.

Each ""level"" is a kind of metaphor to go deeper into the subconscious. Like, they need the intial mark to dissolve his dad's company or something (I can't really remember what the original goal was exactly), and to do that they ultimately convince his subconscious (him, deeper in the dream) that he has a secret locked away in his mind. That's what leads to that snow level being basically a vault in a fortress. They have to convince him that he's breaking into his own mind to reveal a secret, when in actuality, what's in the vault is what he deeply desires to be true. That ""memory"" is what his subconscious wanted to be locked away. In truth, there was no ""hidden secret"" but they were so deep, and he was so yearning for his father's approval, that they were able to trick his mind at that deep of a level."
72010,"So I have a few,

The obvious ones like fight club and the prestige, great movies!

Seven is one of my all time favorites but I think someone has already mentioned it

I watched a movie on Netflix once called 13 sins (I think?) And I remember it having a great ending with an exciting twist. Haven't been able to find it again

But my all time favorite twist ending to a movie was the ending to Arrival. Such an amazing twist and probably the best alien movie I've ever seen."
72011,"I knew you'd say that. 

But seriously, watching it a second time knowing the twist ending makes it that much better. That movie is incredibly well crafted, from the very first scene."
72012,Arrival I agree with you. My favourite as well
72013,"I'd say Law-abiding Citizen.

That reveal that HE was the one doing everything, that no one was helping him, and he'd accounted for being in any random solitary confinement cell blew my mind."
72014,"I think the ending was terrible though... why’d they decide to blow up the prison? Just shoot the guy and throw the bomb in the middle of a field, don’t have to destroy property and endanger lives."
72015,Vanilla sky.
72016,"a beautiful mind
i watched it not knowing anything about the movie or the person it was made about and was really surprised haha"
72017,The Exam is pretty awesome.
72018,"His name is Robert Paulson. Oh, I mean usual suspects"
72019,"Dumb and Dumber. ""The town is back THAT way!"""
72020,I was blown away realizing that her nane was going to end up Mary Christmas
72021,"Wow, I don't know how I never realized that from all the times I've watched it."
72022,Planet of the Apes or Memento.
72023,"Yes, Planet of the Apes as long as you haven't seen any promo poster of the freaking cover to the DVD. Nobody wants to ruin a great twist more than the producers of that movie."
72024,"Having no prior knowledge of the movie, when I saw it in High school, at the end I let out a long quite Daaaaaaaaamn"
72025,"Thats right, when I realised it was actually the youngest fratelli brother trying to set him up my mind came out of my anus"
72026,"My younger cousin did not know of the twist - he even saw Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, and thought that in a sequel the apes would take a spaceship to their own planet.

He was shocked when he found out"
72027,I also enjoy memento's twist a lot. The inter-weaved story lines is a style I've tried to replicate in my writing.
72028,"It's a great twist becaus it not only comes out of left field and is a ""holy shit"" moment, but it also enhances the story and gives the protagonist more depth."
72029,Nobody has said Oldboy yet.
72030,"It has to be Oldboy hands-down. Craziest twist ending i've seen, even in Korean"
72031,"the most depressing fucking twist.

i had to pause the movie at that point."
72032,Yea I did. Than saw yours. This movie has THE best twist.
72033,"I always think of Incendies when someone talks about Oldboy, even more wtf"
72034,I wonder if the American remake will be able to tackle this or just stay clear of it.
72035,"Empire Strikes Back, obviously"
72037,"Dark is ""Dunkel."" His name would've have been ""Dunkel Vater"" if it was in German."
72038,"Vater would be German.

Vader is Dutch for father.

But I enjoyed the reference."
72039,"Not true, actually, it's just a happy coincidence that Vader is the Dutch word for father. When Lucas originally made the name Darth Vader he had been playing around with the words 'death' and 'invader', and changed them just slightly to get Darth Vader. (He did the same for the emperor, took 'death insidious' and we have Darth Sidious from that)"
72040,"Seriously, Sith naming scheme is to just take an evil sounding word and then put ""Darth"" in front of it."
72041,"Ain't nothing wrong with that! Simple, and effective! Lets you know who the bad guy is just by mere mention"
72042,Acca-excuse me??
72043,So saddened that Empire and Psycho are hurried in this thread. Get off my lawn with your torture porn
72044,"I gotta say Saw. I remember seeing the first one in theaters and my jaw dropped. I kept looking around the theater to see other people's reactions.  

...And then they ruined it by releasing 86 sequels. Oh well, the first one was great."
72045,"I actually enjoyed the first 3 and thought it could've stood alone as a cool trilogy with a few tweaks, but after the third the series took a HUGE nosedive."
72046,"Agreeing, the 6th one was pretty good too but they def should have stopped at 3 and wrapped it the fuck up."
72047,"I feel like they could have  made more good ones if they didnt KILL THE MAIN ANTAGONIST IN THE THIRD MOVIE.

Seriously who makes 7 movies about a villian who dies in the third movie? so man damn flashbacks."
72048,"Or kill the main protagonist if the third movie as the twist for the fourth.  I was so excited to see him escape and search for his daughter as a subplot in four.  But no, the writers had to make us think about that trapped kid throughout the fourth one only to show is, hey, you didn't even need to start worrying yet."
72049,"Someone at the end of a contract, I imagine."
72050,"That the thing. The antagonistic is in every movie through flashbacks.

The writers said ""We think this series should end at three"".

The producers said ""We don't""."
72051,"The first three were all made by the same team, after that the studio just kept making them because they were so popular."
72052,"It was a cool twist, but later all I could think about was that I'd be able to tell if he was alive. I know the, ""that's the whole point, you wouldn't"" argument. I just can't help it."
72053,"Well it's explained in the third(?) film I think, where he takes some sort of intense muscle relaxers and stuff to slow his heart rate."
72054,"Exactly, and if you're chained up in a disgusting old bath house or something, you probably aren't going to be super focused on the guy with his brains spilling out."
72055,"The best thing about the saw movies for me was when I told my sister I went to see Saw II. 

Her response was ""I saw Saw II, too!"""
72056,"I had a friend in high school named Ed who was into making amateur short films. Whenever I worked with him and another friend, the most difficult phrase to spill out of our mouths was ""Ed edited it."""
72057,"God damn I say that all the time! I don't have a friend named Ed who is into editing at all, it's just that it came to me one day what a funny phrase that would be. Glad to hear that it has real-world applications.

Another surprisingly hard thing to say is ""I bathed today."" If you try to say it fast, it comes out ""I bathe today"" but try saying it correctly and hilarity will follow. Or you may snicker at least."
72058,"Would you like an ice cold beer, or a nice cold beer?"
72059,"It seemed like every horror movie around this time was going for a crazy twist ending, so when I saw it in the theater I turned to my friend and jokingly said he was the killer when it showed him in the hospital bed. 

The looks on our faces when he turned out to be the killer was priceless."
72060,I guess I gotta see saw
72061,"[let's go,bro](http://imgur.com/IuXjOuq)"
72062,"Ok but if you jump off while
I'm in the air again your not invited to my birthday"
72063,I actually really really liked the 6th one and the twist in it. Great stuff.
72064,Something I started to hate with the series was that they made a lot of the games simply unwinnable (I know some of them were purposely unwinnable but a lot of the legit traps were unwinnable).  A lot of people HAD to die like the one with the shotgun carousel.
72065,"Pandorum. That twist was really an ""oh shit"" moment."
72066,I really enjoyed that movie but never hear too much about it. Very underrated in my opinion.
72067,God when they opened up the Window cover to reveal a starless sky. For a second I thought they'd been in the ship so long that the universe had died.
72068,"I also loved it how they made it that they have been on the ship for like 1000 years. At first they were talking about speeding up evolution and I was like, speeded up in 20 years that's bull. Than the end was like ohhhhhh"
72069,This was an excellent twist. It deserved to be in a better movie.
72070,I thought it was pretty good.
72071,"I wish they would follow it up somehow with all the survivors on the planet, would be interesting I think."
72072,The Others.
72073,I loved Matchstick's Men ending. Fit so well with the main plot.
72074,It's really a shame how many people don't know about Matchstick Men.
72076,One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. It's so good.
72077,That Gere can act? I was shocked.
72078,"He was very good in An Officer and a Gentlemen, and Chicago."
72079,The Game with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Had a mindsplosion all over the screen.
72080,"It fake! Wait...no, it's real! Wait....it's fake! Oop, no it's real! Or is it...? Nope, definitely fake. Well, I dunno...it could be real. It's totally real. Is it?"
72081,Exactly! You just never knew what was coming next. A great thriller and great twist.
72082,My balls fell off.
72083,What a twist!
72084,Yep. On netflix by the way. (or it was a few months ago)
72085,MRW after I saw it: i.imgur.com/oo35Z.gif
72086,"If you happen to enjoy reading fiction, you should check out The Magus by John Fowles. It is the novel that the script for The Game was supposedly ripped off from. (I would have to agree) The setting is completely changed but the mindfuckery is crazy."
72087,[The Usual Suspects.](/spoiler)
72088,"What's the point of blacking it out? I mean, you won't be able to tell what movie it is without reading it..."
72089,I tried to do the right thing...that has to count for something right?
72090,"It will always be this, just this, mostly this. Sometimes."
72091,Lucky Number Slevin. The Kansas City Shuffle at its finest.
72092,The Sixth Sense
72093,"So, just some related discussion here. I think the reason why this film's ""twist"" is so satisfying is that it doesn't exist for its own sake - it's a part of a wider stream of catharsis for the characters, and the resolution of a lot of mystery throughout the film. The Sixth Sense had a fantastic twist that enhanced the film, but it didn't *need* the twist to be successful. Unbreakable (my personal favorite) had a great twist as well, which really [spoiler](/s ""threw Sam Jackson's character's obsession into a new context."") Signs also had everything ""working out"" and coming together because that was part of the movie's theme. Only The Village's twist is really a gimmick. People have this idea that Shyamalan is a hack because he ""relies on twists"" or some such thing, but his later movies aren't bad because of their reliance on tropes; they're bad because they're *bad*."
72094,"I agree with your point here, though I would argue The Village's twist is just as much a part of the movie's theme as the ending of Signs."
72095,"Signs is primarily about religion, though, which makes the twist and God making things happen for a reason have the ending not really be a twist in the slightest."
72096,Yeah I would not call Signs a twist ending. Like the above poster said it's more that all the details sort of come together.
72097,I'll have to rewatch it - it's the only of Shyamalan's four watchable films that I haven't revisited since it came out. I was 17 so maybe I'll feel different about it now.
72098,"Indeed.

**Village spoilers to follow:** I mean regardless of whether you feel it works or not, it's definitely related. The Village is about the way we cope with evil and pain. The society presented to us has decided to run from it, to hide, to pretend it doesn't exist. Misguided but well-meaning, they use fear as a tool to protect their families from the difficulties they endured. Of course they eventually find that evil can still infiltrate their primitive paradise from within."
72099,"You make your point well and I could see having a decent debate on the subject, but I disagree completely. In fact, the twist in The Village not only completely destroys the tension built through the entire film, but also diminishes any sense of connection and relatability we may have felt for the protagonists. Ask yourself, what is to be gained from knowledge that it does not actually take place in the past? Could this village not have been a congregation of pioneers tired of the greed and death that filled much of the early american history? That they made a settlement away from everything else in order to escape the evil and pain of the world? Does the fact that they started this village in say, the 1970's as opposed to the 1870's make any change to the story we've been told so far, or even have any impact on the themes presented? This is the very first(and possibly only) case of Shymalan having a needless twist. In fact, I think the village would've been a much better film had they simply 1. Not had the twist. and 2. Saved the reveal of Bryce Dallas Howard learning the monsters aren't real until  AFTER the chase with Adrien Brody. Those two things alone would've made that film on par with his first three. But his ego got too big, and his lack of understanding of his own works shown through."
72100,"I concur.  I did enjoy the twist to The Sixth Sense and the needing to rewatch the film to ensure it all now made sense.  I also felt stupid for entirely dismissing the fact that he is shot at point blank range at the beginning of the film.  The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and Cape Fear were equally well done.  The Village for me was a cop out.  As was Vanilla sky.  Was very disappointed watching these."
72101,"It's between Fight Club, Memento and The Prestige."
72102,"The Prestige blew my mind, fuckin blew my mind harder then your mother last night. [Spoiler] (/s ""But for real the Si-Fi twist at the end was amazing. I heard people call it a cop out, but fuck that it was a total psychological mind fuck"")"
72103,That movie seems to get better every time I watch it.  Definitely one of my favorites
72105,"The Prestige was amazing. The beauty of this ""cop out"" as people call it is how it is reflected in the movie and especially how Borden describes to the little boy: ""The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything"" F**king loved it"
72106,She said she was at pottery class...
72107,My favourite film.
72108,"Psycho and Citizen Kane, even though everyone already knows both twists."
72109,"[Spoiler](/s ""Rosebud was his mother."")"
72110,Some people claim that rosebud was an affectionate term William Randolph Hearst used for his wife's oodly bits.
72111,"Basic, there are 8 twist endings in that movie."
72112,"That movie was *very* flawed, and I see it get a lot of hate, but I love it so much.  That ending when [](/s ""you see that most of the characters are badasses and alive and the whole thing was planned to root out bad guys, and then Black Betty starts playing and the credits hit, just makes me wish there was a sequel called SECTION 8 all about the adventures of that team with Travolta, Jackson, Nielsen, Diggs, and the rest returning and Black Betty as the theme song."")"
72114,"Cabin in the woods wasn't much of a twist ending though, they reveal it at the beginning."
72115,"I thought the twist was that things didn't work out in the end.  The mini twist is that it's not your average horror movie, and revealed early, but the real shocker came that there's no happy ending."
72116,"They reveal it at the beginning, but it gets deeper than you think. You think you're shown the whole story, and you're not, so it's really a twist ending."
72117,"Yeh agreed, but a cool idea none the less."
72118,"I guess the village while watching it

I was like, there's a twist and wouldn't it be funny if...."
72120,Fight Club for me too.
72121,Repomen was pretty mind fuck to me
72122,"Logged in just to upvote this. I walked around depressed for the rest of the day, did not see it coming."
72123,Depressed a whole lot too:(
72124,"Things suddenly started going so well something had to be up.  The specific twist was a surprise but it wasn't a shocker things were not what they seemed.

I've noticed this a lot recently.  Writers and directors will hit a certain beat once too many and then I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Too many lingering shots of a happy couple means one of them is not long for this world.  Someone pulls out their daughters picture a bit too often and there's a car bomb 3 scenes later"
72125,"I don't know if it would be considered a twist, but the end of The Mist made me physically get up and pace around the room dealing with the shock. I don't think I've ever seen something that was so moving and unexpected."
72126,"I forgot about this movie. One of two movies that made me ""feel"" something die inside me emotionally. The other being Requiem for a Dream"
72127,"My mate watched it the night before and told me that the twist ending was amazing. Sat down and watched it with him and about 5 minuets before I clocked it, was sat there with my head in my hands just waiting, brilliant film."
72128,Better ending than the book.
72129,Even Stephen King himself agreed.
72130,Just a few minutes more!!! Damn...
72131,Reminded me of The Canyon.
72133,That fucking ship sank? I only watched the first bit. That Cameron pulled the wool right over my eyes...
72134,"The Departed. DiCaprio's character.
Edit: More surprise than twist now that I think of it."
72135,one interesting added facet to this movie is that matt damon's character is potentially either gay or was molested as a child (evidently by someone in the church) and impotent as a result. pretty interesting and almost entirely unspoken
72136,"Except for that one scene where his girlfriend says ""it happens to plenty of men"" but does the timing of her and DiCaprio having sex coincide with it being his kid instead of Matt Damon's?"
72137,">almost entirely
and she says that quietly and almost in passing

Also, it's assumed that it's dicaprio's kid. she's gettin down on him not long after damon can't perform. I don't remember if she gives a time frame of how long she's been pregnant, but at that time she and damon's character had been in a relationship a while so you assume they were (at least) attempting sex on a regular basis in addition to actual sex with Dicaprio's character"
72138,Se7en. I mean. Come on.
72141,The twist in that movie was ruined by the pre-delay trailers.
72142,"There seems to be a lot of negativity about this movie, though while I pretty much saw the ending coming that wasn't the point: The execution of the ending and what it meant for the character was pulled off in an honest way that made sense for the character but was surprising to boot. Seriously, the fact that we don't just read Wikipedia rather than watching movies indicates that execution matters..."
72144,"Is that an Ocean's 11 reference, or are you just being overly vague?"
72145,Thanks for spoiling it.  I was going to go see that this weekend.
72146,No one for the Crying Game?
72147,We don't really feel like having a sexual identity crisis at the moment. Best to suppress all memory of that film.
72148,I know all there is to know about that girls penis*
72149,"Memento i'd say has very good twist, but after all it's all a continuous twist."
72150,"The Usual Suspects is the top one for me simply because at first, there's the twist and you think ""oh man, it was that guy all along"" and then, BAM! They twist the twist. Either way, the best ones are the movies that, as soon as you're finished, you want to watch again to see if the twist holds out from the beginning because you just didn't see it."
72151,"Not only that, but the twist makes the second viewing of the movie even more interesting."
72152,"I'm torn between ""The Game"" and ""Skeleton Key""."
72153,"I really enjoyed the twist at the end of Skeleton Key. As someone who watches way too many movies, this one gave me the best, ""wait, what?"" moments in probably a 5 year span."
72154,Not only that Skeleton Key is really creepy. I forgot how much I liked that movie.
72155,I didn't see it coming either!  That's the best kind of twist.
72156,Frailty!
72157,The Game with Michael Douglas
72158,"Psycho. Also. Even though it wasn't great, I thought Red Lights had a neat twist."
72159,Cypher. I really did not see it coming at all.
72160,Mother
72161,Mother Night with Nick Nolte
72162,"The Ring or dare I say, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. I know what you're thinking but there was A LOT of people who didn't see that now iconic line coming."
72163,"Arlington Road, although not a 'twist' in the same way Fight Club or Sixth Sense are."
72164,"The list so far is very basic and obvious. Here are some movie not everybody on earth has seen: ""The Spanish Prisoner"", ""Skin Game"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Unknown"", ""Phenomena"" ""Shattered"", ""limbo"",. .."
72165,You are my kind of person. I was going to post a very similar list with the exception of Limbo which I have not seen. And I may have thrown in Charade as well.
72166,Which Limbo are you talking about?
72167,"Not the best by any means, but i think it deserves to be mentioned.

Triangle"
72168,"There is absolutely no way to avoid spoilers here. If you read the thread, you'll spoil any movie listed that you haven't seen."

72170,"A great movie. Like seriously,  [Spoiler](/s ""fuck that bitch."")"
72171,High tension
72172,"this ""twist"" has so many parts wrong with it once you rewatch the movie. increased strength ability, driving a truck and gettin' beej's from disembodied heads, etc.

maybe that last one was just part of some fantasy that the viewer is seen as manifesting, when it's not actually reality? i dont know. but I do enjoy this movie and should rewatch it sometime"
72173,If anything it teaches us not to buy an audi
72174,"that ending sucked. it felt like such a cop out. it was a great slasher movie up until then. [Spoiler](/s ""it was just as bad as ""OH IT WAS ALL ONLY A DREAM !"""")"
72175,A 'spoiler' here would already be giving the title of a movie.
72176,Witness for the prosecution.  I counted 5 in under 2 minutes.
72177,Sleepaway Camp. Not even kidding.
72178,Mulholland Dr. if it counts
72179,Whether or not it was a twist wil confuddle me for many tim
72180,"Don't know if it's really a twist. It's a good movie, and really open to interpretation, so depending on how you interpret it, it could be a twist. Or it might not be."
72181,"yeah, that's why i was unsure if it was or not. sort of in the same vein, i consider persona in there as well"
72182,Casino Royale.
72183,"Primer. The movie itself will blow your mind, but the second time you watch it, when you understand, then the end will blow your mind"
72184,">the 98 billionth time you watch it, when you understand, then the end will blow your mind

FTFY"
72185,The Vanishing
72186,Take Shelter
72187,"[Spoiler](/s ""Unbreakable deserves an honorable mention."")"
72188,"Jurassic Park III, in the way that I was expecting one and there wasn't any."
72189,I was legitimately surprised by Sound of My Voice.
72190,The Crying Game
72191,"I take that back, the sixth sense."
72193,Memento. It has the greatest twist and also fucks with your mind
72194,The original Mildred Pierce has some nice misdirection about where it's actually heading. I can honestly say it's one of the few twists that I didn't see coming and wasn't shoved in there for the sake of having a twist.
72195,The entire Evil Dead trilogy. Except the theatrical cut of Army of Darkness
72196,Saw I has just the most insane twist.
72197,One that i doubt many of you have seen is [Spellbinder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096152/?ref_=sr_2) with Kelly Preston and Tim Daly.  I didn't expect that ending at all.
