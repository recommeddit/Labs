I'd slot the second Gurren Lagann movie somewhere near the top if I was counting movies, but for simplicity's sake I prefer keeping my favorite movies separate from my favorite anime (to say nothing of the fact that Gurren Lagann the *show* is already on the list anyways)."
24497,Very cool list. I've been meaning to get really into Gundam. Currently only 2 episodes into Zeta. Btw  i thought the TTGL movies were just glorified recaps. Is the second one really that great?
24498,">I've been meaning to get really into Gundam. Currently only 2 episodes into Zeta.

[Nice!](#rengehype) I assume you watched the original beforehand, have you seen any of the others yet?

> Btw i thought the TTGL movies were just glorified recaps. Is the second one really that great?

They are, but the second one has a lot more additions than the first one did (had a montage of stuff through [TTGL](/s ""the timeskip"") instead of it just *happening*, added some Nia characterization, and added a bit more Simon to the epilogue), [has its own remix of Sorairo Days](https://youtu.be/lyqFZFv3FcY), and the final battle somehow managed to be infinite times more hype than the final battle of the show was, which shouldn't be possible. Then again, doing the impossible is how Team Gurren rolls, so."
24499,">Nice! I assume you watched the original beforehand, have you seen any of the others yet?

Yeah i've only watched the original movie trilogy and plan to do ZZ then Chars Counterattack and be done with the UC.

And damn i really need to watch that movie then lol, thanks!"
24500,"> plan to do ZZ then Chars Counterattack and be done with the UC.

You should 100% watch Unicorn (the 7 OVAs, not the 22 episodes) after Char's Counterattack then, but other than that solid plan!

>And damn i really need to watch that movie then lol, thanks!

[](#helmetbro) Commie's subs for it are solid if you can find them, although their typesetting for the second movie wasn't as fancy as what they'd done for the first one."
24501,">You should 100% watch Unicorn (the 7 OVAs, not the 22 episodes) after Char's Counterattack then, but other than that solid plan!


Oh yeah i definitely won't be done with Gundam after UC lol, ty for recommendation. 

>Commie's subs for it are solid if you can find them, although their typesetting for the second movie wasn't as fancy as what they'd done for the first one

I'll try and find them. Once again, thanks!"
24502,"No prob! I'd also recommend watching the opening of the first movie because it wasn't part of the show as well as the part of the first movie that covers post-episode 8/9 stuff because it's handled *entirely* differently compared to the show and it's more awesome at times, even if you don't want to watch the *entirety* of the first movie before you watch the second one. The second one changes around enough that it needs to be watched in full to not accidentally miss something they changed or added."

24523,"I think this is the post I most agree with this far. However I would remove JoJo's and parasyte, and replace them with knights and magic, and Sword art online(due to it being my first anime)"
24524,Sword art online was great and deserves an honorable mention but the fact that (despite being my first sub anime) I forgot abt it :)
24525,"1. **Monster** - An incredible psychological thriller with a perfectly fitting art and animation style. Johan is godlike and it is my all time favorite anime

2. **Neon Genesis Evangelion** - Watched it for the giant robots. Got hooked by the story and realistic portrayal of the characters' mental issues. The animation became worse due to budget cuts but that fit in perfectly. The ending shown in The End of Evangelion was even better.

3. **Cowboy Bebop** - a true classic, it was simply perfect. A classic adventure story of bounty hunters combined with masterful storytelling, especially when revealing the characters' backstories, with one of the best soundtracks I've heard till date.

4. **Puella Magi Madoka Magica** - I'm glad I didn't skip it just because of the magical girls. It was unexpectedly good with dark psychological elements. I'll always recommend it even if you don't like magical girl anime.

5. **Death Note** - my first anime ever. Everything about it was great - the story, the animation, the characters, the soundtrack ... I might be a bit biased but Death Note will always be one of my favorite anime

6. **Gurren Lagann** - Gurren Lagann is the definition of epic. TL;DR: kick reason to the curb to make the impossible possible. The story is also good, but mind-blowing epic mecha action is the best thing about it. ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER!!

7. **Code Geass** - I found it sort of similar to death note. Lelouch executing his plans is always a treat to watch and there are GIANT ROBOTS. Plus an amazing ending in season 2.

8. **Steins;Gate** - sci-fi, comedy, romance, psychological thriller - Steins;Gate has everything. It's a masterpiece and I'll always recommend it.

9. **91 Days** - arguably the most un-anime-ish anime I've seen, this noir anime is pretty underrated imo. No silly anime tropes, just a pure story of friendship and revenge. The ending, while not perfect, fits the tone of the show.

10. **Erased** - an excellent psychological drama, the only thing I can complain about is the ending. Even then it's worth it."
24526,"1. Madoka Magica- As some are aware, I vomited watching it. That was unexpected, but the show completely sucked me in, and the characters had me completely captivated.

2. Steins;Gate- This one hooked from the start, and was nothing short of a thrill ride from beginning to end. Even the slower stretches have an excellent feeling of tension that I loved.

3. Usagi Drop- So many happy tears were shed. Everything about it feels so real, and I love how Rin and Daikichi grow together throughout the show.

4. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood- The show does a great job balancing the action, adventure, comedy and drama, with a great cast of characters.

5. Rakugo- Some of the most engaging characters I've ever seen. It's a show that really brings forth a great sense of passion, and really knows when to pull at the heart strings."
24527,"God, I love how nonchalantly you brought up the vomiting here. 

Also, I dropped off on the Steins;Gate rewatch around episode 16, but I'm glad to hear you enjoyed the series as much as you did. I had a feeling you might considering your opinion of Madoka."
24528,"Pretty nice variety you have, which is always nice to see in favorites lists. 

Here's my response from when a previous user once asked me:

Overall, I'd say I value quality character interactions, writing/dialogue, execution of themes, and directing. If an anime has at least two of those, I'm likely to enjoy it more than an anime that lacks those but happens to have fluid animation, an original premise, and a suspenseful plot (even though I love all those things too). 

So, here's my top 10 in rough order starting from my favorite. I've written near essays on why some are in my top 10, but I'll just give a brief reasoning here. This will be more personalized instead of tailored towards how I would recommend them to anyone else.

* [K-On!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On) - High school girls eat cake, drink tea, and sometimes play instruments. As I said in my above comment, this is one of the comfiest anime I've ever seen. The character interactions just feel so natural and like a true friend group. There's this sense of nogstalia present throughout the anime that reminds the viewer of the passage of time and how easily it can be for high school life to pass you by. I can watch any single scene of the show and immediately burst out into a smile.

* [Madoka Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka★Magica?q=madoka) - A show about magical girls fighting witches. The directing and writing in this show is phenomenal and the accompanying soundtrack is a masterpiece. The characters are pitted in a harsh situation and all five of them share different philosophies towards the matter. Often has me revisiting the series for the stellar animation and questions it poses as to what the right decision in any given scenario presented. Even better on a rewatch due to picking up on the foreshadowing present.

* [Your Name](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa) - Likely many of the same reasons you loved it. The animation, color palette, background art, and character designs are all absolutely gorgeous. I love a romance so that quickly connected me to the characters. While I don't live in as a remote location as Mitsuha, I've always wanted to live in a big city so I immediately emphasized with her desires to move to Tokyo. The visual symbolism present throughout the film was masterful and upon a rewatch so many pieces of foreshadowing are made available that it becomes a completely different experience.

* [The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu?q=disappearan) - A sequel film to the series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya. Culminates the themes and characterization of the previous two seasons into a masterpiece of a film. The use of color and sound is nothing short of genius, the voice acting feels so *real* and the plot had me on the edge of my seat, even on a rewatch.

* [Oregairu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru?q=yahar) - In no work of fiction that I have listened to, read, or watched have I related to a character more than Hikigaya Hachiman. Witnessing his warped view of society and the pain he held towards feeling like an outcast only to mask that pain with a rejection of social constructs was like looking into a mirror of my younger self. The way the show depicted that this viewpoint on society and life is ultimately self-destructive opened my eyes towards how unhealthy my own beliefs and way of life were. I can't say I've completely changed as a result, but I am much more conscious now on how my attitude affects others, and I try (but usually fail) to be a little less cynical as time goes on.

* [Hunter x Hunter (2011)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011?q=hun) - A fun, heartwrenching, dramatic, and spectacular journey about a young boy setting out to explore the world and find his father. The immensely large cast feels fully fleshed out, even for characters that have greater relevance past a couple episodes. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and always sets the tone properly. It's one of the only long running shows that never dipped in animation quality. In one particular arc, neither side is seen as evil, but morally grey and the characterization in said arc is one of my favorites in all of fiction.

* [5 Centimeters per Second](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter?q=5%20centimete) - A film directed by Makoto Shinkai that is in my opinion the greatest depiction of what it means to drift out of love.

* [Love Live School Idol Project](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live_School_Idol_Project?q=love%20live%20school) - As mentioned in the above comment, Love Live SIP is a cute anime with some dramatic moments. The bonding that occured between the girls (particularly in the second season) felt like a real friendship to me. There's a ton of fun gags throughout the show and the performances that the group puts on are great to listen to.

* [Akatsuki no Yona](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona?q=akatsuk) - As mentioned in the above comment, I **loved** the female protagonist in here. The unique setting drew me in from the start and I think the entire cast meshes extremely well.

* [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://myanimelist.net/anime/232/Cardcaptor_Sakura?q=cardca) - Magical girl anime with themes of hope, perserverance, and relationships (familial, platonic, and romantic). Sakura is one of the best written child characters I've seen in fiction, and the show is just comfy with most plot points being concluded within the episode.

* [No Game No Life: Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33674/No_Game_No_Life__Zero) - A prequel film to the series No Game No Life that I mentioned to you in the above comment. This film is just a suspenseful, dramatic spectacle to watch. The use of color, soundtrack, and voice acting are some of the best I've witnessed. Without going into any spoilers, there is enough similarity between this and the main series that the viewer feels familar with what's going on until certain elements are subverted."
24529,"Oregairu was soooo good, I can agree 100% with what you said in that it’s an anime that I could relate with so well and it gives great life lessons."
24530,We have the same top 2 aye!
24531,[](#eyythisguy)
24532,"I loved Yona of the Dawn, but I want another season from it, it was basically a prologue to the actual story, Yona the MC really grew into an awesome character by the end of it"
24533,"> it felt like a prologue to the actual story

That's basically what it is. The manga really, *really* opens up, and the story hits its stride not a couple chapters after where the anime leaves off."
24534,"I've heard but it hasn't been long enough since it came out to make me give up on a 2nd season, and I usually stick to anime (Soul Eater, and Kimi Ni Todoke are the only exceptions) guess I should have worded it differently, it was basically a prologue instead of it felt"
24535,">[K-On!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On)

Looking back at it, very little things happened and it still managed to be 10/10. Would watch people eat cake for 50 episodes again"
24536,"1.Baccano. Extremly fun cast of characters, the achronological way the story is told makes you think.
2.Durarara. Longer than Baccano so it can have better character development, limited geographical area is both its biggest weakness and biggest strenght compared to Baccano
3. HunterxHunter. Shounen battle series done right. Complex. Nice themes. And the best antagonists in anime.
4.Steins;Gate. Time travel has always been my jam and this is doing it right. Not as good as the VN since that’s more emotional, but good enough
5.Mawaru Penguindrum. Emotions overflow, perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, Ikuhara is a mad genius"
24537,"1) 3-Gatsu no Lion: Beautiful.  Amazing art and production(Shaft).  Super relatable and likable MCs.  [Kawamoto girls are too precious](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7cc071f09a007d9516c7fc00a32e100e/tumblr_oo13156GfO1vlb6q0o1_500.gif)

2) Kekkai Sensen: Pure fun and coolness.  God-tier soundtrack with great animation, funny characters and an amazing setting.  Very good dub is also a plus.

3) Houseki no Kuni: Atmospheric.  The CGI is just unreal and the MC is super likable.

4-10, in no particular order)

Your Name: Great to look at with an engaging story.

Honey and Clover: Same author as 3-Gatsu.  Such a great coming of age/romance story.  All the characters are super relatable.  Only complaint is that it's pretty slow at first.

Cowboy Bebop: Absolute Classic.  Spike is one of the greatest anime characters of all time and anoth God-tier soundtrack.  Best dub.

Shirobako:  Gives us a look on how the shows we love so much are made.  [Cried like a b*tch at the end when](/s ""a certain someone got a job"")

New Game!!:  Like Shirobako but about video games with a little less drama and more moe.  All the characters are really fun to watch.

Shinseki Yori: really dark and spooky.  Very psychological.  Slow start though.

Kiki's Delivery Service: Nostalgic coming of age story.  Like all Ghibli movies the art and animation are on point, and the dub is very good."

24549,"1. Made in Abyss  - A great exploration of an interesting fantasy world. The Abyss is a giant pit in the earth, and people brave its depths to uncover rare artifacts. As they delve deeper, explorers encounter monsters and trials of ever increasing dangers, and the series starts leaning towards darker and darker themes as it goes on. This series really just hits all the elements of my personal favorite types of shows.

2. 3-Gatsu no Lion - A drama/slice-of-life series that follows a highschool-age professional shogi player, his life's struggles, and his interaction with a small friendly family of three girls and their grandpa that runs a sweets shop. It is a series that depicts depression, and in the second season bullying, in a very realistic and moving manner. There are also many great lighthearted moments in the series as well. Overall, an amazing series that actually shares my number 1 spot, and it and Made in Abyss are both amazing yet very different types of shows.

3. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou - A great slice of life, but with a twist. It follows two girls in military uniform, who drive around a post-apocalyptic wasteland of a world. However, even with this dark backdrop, the series is still incredibly calm and lighthearted. Slice of life is one of my favorite genres, and this one pulled it off excellently, with a unique and interesting backdrop.

4. Steins;Gate - A great science fiction series with fun and quirky characters, and a neat and well thought out time travel plot. The start of it was pretty slow, but once the plot picked up around 8-ish episodes in, it had my full attention and never let go.

5. My Hero Academia - A fun and interesting world full of people with superpowers, or ""quirks"", where being a hero is actually a regulated job that many people strive for. It basically follows a group of  students through super-hero high school, and the majority of the characters are very interesting and likable. I often don't enjoy the typical ""shounen"" series, but this show avoided a lot of the tropes and has rather well written stories and characters. It lands in my top five because it is by far my personal favorite of a genre that I don't usually enjoy as much.

4. Monogatari Series - It goes for mystery, drama, romance, ecchi, comedy, meta, supernatural, and coming of age. And it does all of them well

5. Mob Psycho 100 - Refreshingly off-beat comedy and a surprisingly endearing art style with a nice thematic backbone tying it all together"
24551,Thanks for sharing!
24552,"In no particular order it goes something like this

1) Fate/Zero - One of the shows that cemented me as an anime fan. I loved pretty much the whole cast, and the conflict was superb I felt.

2) Gurenn Lagann - The show is well.... very animated. It was super stylish and had a unique charm that no other show has been able to replicate for me. The over the top action and characters were highly entertaining for me to watch.

3)Steins;Gate - The story overall was extremely well executed. Super lovable characters that made you really engaged in their struggle. The story is also very neat and wraps up well.

4) Chunnibyou - Every time I watch this show I fell like the Grinch, my heart grows 3 sizes after a viewing. Very funny and entertaining in addition to giving a pretty profound message in my opinion.

5) Wattamote- It hurts so bad to watch this show, yet it feels soooo good for some reason. This show is executed extremely well and I had some very good laughs watching it.

6) Prisoni School - I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did when I started it. Ecchi shows are normally very meh for me, but this one is different. The complete stupidity of all the situations the cast got in and how seriously they took it made the show for me. Also has Gakuto who I think is a shining example of what men should aspire to be.

7)Jojo's Bizzare Adventure's - This show just works. It also gives me a show to meme about with friends so it's much appreciated

8) Berserk (1996) - Admittedly the show is a bit dated and has some flaws. However, I think it does the best job of adapting the manga so far. It definitely holds a special place in my heart for introducing me to the never ending suffering of being a Berserk fan.

9) FMA: B -Show had me hooked from the very beginning. The amount of development everybody in the show undergoes is extremely solid. Had an extremely satisfying conclusion to me.

10) Nisekoi - Bit of a guilty pleasure here. I often find myself going back to it just to turn my brain off for a second and soak in all the glorious cheesiness of generic harem tropes. On paper this show should be 6/10 but it executes everything so well that it elevates it to a 8-9/10 for me."
24553,"1. Gurren Lagann - An over the top mecha series that I like to describe as ""fucking awesome"". Every time I watch this show it feels like I'm a kid again, constantly cheering during its hypest moments. Fun characters, amazing designs and visuals, and the heights this series goes make it something truly special for me.

2. Hunter x Hunter - Great characters, a fantastic power system, and amazing strategic fight sequences make this my favorite shounen of all time. I believe the chimera ant arc to be one of greatest out there, and is a big reason why this is a big favorite of mine.

3. Gintama - A comedy that likes to parody a large variety of other anime. This show has some of the most lovable characters I've ever seen in a show. The jokes are very over the top and creative, leaving me in tears most of the time. While it is primarily a comedy, it can be anything it wants and still be amazing at it. One such area is action, and it has some damn good fight sequences.

4. Serial Experiments Lain - A psychological thriller that explores the implications of an Internet-like world. There is a more personal reason with why I fell in love with this series. I am very interested in technology, and how it effect society as a whole, and this series deals with that at its surface. Dwelling even deeper this series has so much more to say, and is rich with substance. Despite its low production value, it has amazing atmosphere and sound design, and had me at the edge of my seat throughout its entire run.

5. Kara no Kyoukai - A series of movies that explores with the psyche of messed up people with crazy powers. My kind of series. These movies have some of the most incredible visuals I have ever seen, with some of the greatest music ever put to an anime.  Also I am in love with the setting of dark urban Japan in the 90s."

24557,"My top 10. Each of these shows has impacted me on a deep level in some way, and I hope that you can get something out of knowing my favorites. 

1. A Place Further than the Universe- Yes, I know it just ended yesterday, but I really don't think I can justify it not being my new favorite anime. For a show about girls going to Antarctica, this is infinitely relatable. YoriMoi has some absolutely phenomenal character dynamics, and it explores each of its main characters in-depth and makes them all multi-faceted individuals and intimately close friends. It's messages about not being afraid to take risks, not being complacent, and the importance of friendship resonate hard, and the series somehow makes its formulaic structure feel organic, with each and every episode making me at least tear up (and in some cases completely break).  

2. K-On- Fun things are fun, and when you make that fun build-up to one of the most emotional coming-of-age stories I've ever seen, you get something special. K-On is hilarious, adorable, has great character development, and is infinitely relatable and emotional. It's depth of characterization is nearly unmatched, and the girls feel like real friends, more like family, who remind me way too much of my own close group of friends. I also relate very deeply to Yui's search for motivation and purpose in her new friend group, and Azusa reconciling her feelings of her seniors graduating and leaving her behind, so K-On is exceptionally personal to me. Everything leading up to graduation in the final episode (so about half of season 2) is something I have personally experienced nearly exactly, and it makes everything feel that much more real. On top of that, the school is an exceptionally well-realized setting, and it makes me feel as attached to it as the girls do, and just as sad to leave it behind. I can go on about this show forever, as I've rewatched it no less than 4 (and counting) times and discover something new each and every time. 

3. Aria- Aria's setting is an accomplishment; Neo-Venezia is insanely well realized with surprisingly deep lore and a rich history. But on top of top-tier world-building, Aria's captivating atmosphere and fantastic characters hooked me. It's simple life lessons are applicable to anyone, and it conveys them with heart and emotional depth. As a coming-of-age story, Aria makes me want to treasure the every-day while I still can, before moving to the next stage of my life and leaving it all behind. Plus its filled with great visual comedy and is just as endearing as it is emotionally affecting. 

4. Clannad- Lots has been said about Clannad, but its so much more than just cry-porn. Clannad truly fleshes out its main characters and makes them feel real. Tomoya and Nagisa complete each other as people, and it was easy to get invested in their relationship. The side characters are all a joy, and season 1 gave most of them what they deserve, but as a story about family, and tragedy, After Story is real and raw. This is a show that legitimately changed the way I think, and made me actively change some relationships in my life. This is the series I get the most defensive about (especially in regards to the ending), and that's because of how valuable and expertly-crafted I believe it to be. 

5. Shinsekai Yori- Another show with top-tier world-building, Shinsekai Yori slowly builds up into one of the most impactful and thought-provoking thematic experiences I've ever had. Watching its characters grow from childhood to adulthood and continuously change their views as they learn more about their intriguing world and develop mentally is compelling, and even more-so is the series ""villain"" who is both complex and sympathetic in a way that really calls into question a lot of what I, and the characters, thought we knew. I love the aesthetic as well, and it has some of the most striking shot-composition I've seen (and a great soundtrack to boot). 

6. Fate/Zero- I've always been a fan of anything relating to Greek mythology, so a series styled like a Greek tragedy was inherently appealing to me. Fate/Zero has some of the most compelling characters out there, whose clash of ideals were thought-provoking and made the most out of the Fate-series unique premise. Dark and nihilistic, filled with irony and tragedy as well as hope (and awesome animation and music), this show has some of my favorite scenes in anime, and is just freaking fantastic all around. 

7. Shirobako- As a young adult who has creative ambitions (that I don't think I am going to be able to make work unfortunately), Shirobako's exploration of adults chasing their dreams and making do with not-so-ideal situations they get was personal. As an anime fan, its always interesting to take a look into what makes the industry tick (and some great references), and knowing that creators work in that field, in poor working conditions, out of passion for anime is validating. The series also has a unique, quirky sense of humor that always had me smiling, and the combination of that humor and emotion led to my favorite episode of any anime so far (number 23). 

8. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood- Everything's been said about this one. An epic story, excellent characters with deeply personal stakes, great world-building, interesting themes about Truth/Religion and Faith/Equivalent Exchange/Perseverence, great animation, etc. FMA:B has it all and does it all exceptionally well. 

9. Sound! Euphonium- I dedicated 8 years of my life to band, and my deep attachment to music is captured perfectly in this show. It's a very accurate portrayal of concert band, and the detail put into it is astounding. It also has some of the most nuanced and interesting characters out there. Kumiko is my favorite anime protagonist, with her refreshingly snarky personality and personal story to engage with her passion and the people around her being emotionally resonant. Everyone else is fantastic as well, leading to a very impressive ensemble drama (pun totally intended). Plus it has gorgeous animation and is extremely gay. That last part in particular is kind of important. 

10. March Comes in like a Lion- Rei's portrayal of depression and loneliness is painfully accurate. Someone who wants to be helpful but always feels like he's a burden, someone who wants to be loved but who feels he isn't worthy of love, he is empathetic and hugely relatable. This show is incredible at making all of its characters feel distinctly human (never knew I could feel so much for a man reuniting with his pigeon), and its world feels connected and real. It's also really funny and handles its tone shifts in a way that keeps me in Rei's head, but it can also do an arc about bullying that is frighteningly similar to my own experiences with bullying and pack an insane punch. I am also a huge fan of Shaft's visual style, and it's put to great use here (it isn't too much further down my list where you'll find Madoka and Monogatari). It's a bit inconsistent, but its highs are incredible and the lows are those that most anime would be lucky to reach as a high."
24558,"Ah yes, I see you are a man of many tears."

I like well-written characters: not too dramatic, human in the sense that they're complex (not just black or white) but are consistent with their character. The setting would either be a complex universe or, if set in a smaller scope then as long as what is needed for the story is included. I prefer comedy, action, and realism as genre. 

Appealing art-style is a must (Lancelot & others, all hail Murata-sama, Chitanda kawaii~ ""Watashi kininarimasu"", great action scenes, and expressive/hilarious faces). 

Profound, meaningful, relatable, and witty moments/dialogues/lines are part of it, too. Catchy soundtracks are a big plus."
24566,"1. **Code Geass**. Why? Apart from one flaw, it has everything I want in an anime. A massive cast of awesome characters, great pacing with both slow/fast and light/dark themes, some mature topics handled respectfully, every single villain is relate-able and understandable, no major plot holes, epic first episode, and decent animation... downside is too much fan service...

2. **Sword Art Online Abridged** (By Something Witty Entertainment). Apart from Code Geass, the top 4 are really close calls. The original really made me upset, because I loved the first episode and hated every subsequent episode. SAOA fixed every mistake and then some, making a lovable cast of interesting characters, swapping the topic to mature topics handled respectfully, swapping the plot to be well paced and interesting, adding tons of humor... in terms of quality, it blows most official anime out of the water. Biggest weakness? Too short.

3. **Gurren Lagann**. Great story, characters, etc. The world and plot are a little... cheap. A few mature topics hidden away, but it's mostly childish fun. WHICH IS AWESOME.

4. **Assassination Classroom**. Awesome characters, awesome world, awesome pacing... I honestly can't remember what the downside was.

5. **Overlord**. Season one was mediocre, but season two is so perfect it demanded a spot in the top 5.

6. **Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood**. The first few episodes were pretty poorly paced, and I didn't like how weak the final villain felt, character-wise. It just felt over-the-top generic villain. Plus, there weren't as many mature topics as some of the anime above. Until recently, an obvious pick for my top 5.

7. **Youjo Senki**. Honestly, this anime deserves to be higher up the list, but it's suffering for three reasons. 1, it has a smaller cast than most of the above anime. 2, it's really short. 3, it's not worth rewatching a dozen times.

8. **One Punch Man**. Nice story, nice world, and it's always a pleasure to watch, but it has even less mature topics than Gurren Lagann...

9. **Log Horizon**. Yeah... Pretty much a sucker for Isekai. Still, the characters and story here are great. Pacing could do with some work.

10. **Infinite Ryvius**. A solid anime in terms of characters and plot, with a painfully slow start.

Honorable mentions in no particular order: **Steins;Gate** (Slow start, quickly became predictable, packs an emotional punch), **One Piece** (Pacing and story starts strong, degrade over time, but largest cast of awesome characters) and **7 Deadly Sins** (Great time, but pretty surface-level characters, for season 1)."

24568,"I'll do 5 television projects and 5 films.

**TV+**

1- ""Paranoia Agent""

Kon-sensei was something else as a creative force in Japanese animation. This series, the only one he was able to complete before his untimely death in 2010, is an experimental serial thriller that messes with perspective to the point that by the third installment, you won't be able to trust most any character account on the basis that the perspective presented could be so warped that 

2- ""BACCANO""

Simply some of the best narrative and character writing I've seen, like a coherent comic of errors, ambitions, and relationships culminating in some glorious hilarity as well as involving romances and criminal shenanigans. Hell, I rearranged one of the character's titles to make my MAL profile name. It's a big influence on me as an anime viewer.

3- ""MushiShi""

The atmosphere in this program is something unlike anything in western entertainment. The closest thing I can relate it to is a collection of melancholy folk tales one notch below Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The tales are effective, haunting, and very emotional. The density of the fog is something else.

4- ""Cowboy Bebop""

What could I possibly add to the endless paragraphs lauding this hybrid sci fi western romp that hasn't already been laid bare? Not much. That being said, this show does contain my single favorite parody of the original *ALIEN* in all of pop culture. Take that, Mel Brooks.

5- ""Tanaka-kun is always listless""

An odd choice, I'll admit. But my taste in comedy is especially fickle, and this slice of life is something that tickles my preferences perfectly. One of the moments in later episode involving gorilla rankings had me giggling for a good three minutes. The show has a lax pace and chill characterization to equate to the chill music scene on Spotify and YouTube radio. Good for slow days and easy smiles.

**Films**

1- *Mononoke-hime*

This movie singlehandedly graduated me from movie watcher to film student. One night, while my parents were at a conference, I watched this and *Spirited Away* in back to back ten-minute chunks on YouTube, and I was forever enraptured by the amount of detail and themes that Miyazaki-sensei had imbued his films with. ""No Cuts"" was my mantra for years afterward.

2- *Belladonna of Sadness*

Very few films transcend the mere realms of animation and reach that fabled description of pure art. The second entry in the Animerama trilogy is a sumptuous feast of archaic splendor and isolated desolation. The tale of a woman abused, crushed, thrown aside, and her eventual rise to power on her own terms, thanks to a little help from teh devil. The epilogue puts a stamp on the film's feminist trappings and makes for excellent conversational material after the film has finished playing.

3- *Metropolis*

Rintaro's riff on Fritz Lang and *Blade Runner* was another crowning achievement of my life as a film student in training. The final 10 minutes of this film tore my heart in twain and caused me much pain over the course of the next couple days. Tima and Kenichi'i are relationship goals.

4- *the Shape of Voice (A Silent Voice)*

*your name* is an excellent entry into the historical anime canon. This film deserved as much international attention, but due to some strange licensing scenarios, only just made it to the United States for viewing and sharing. Still waiting on that blu ray release. Shoko and Shoya make for one of the most dynamic and affecting relationships I've ever seen portrayed on screen, live action and animated.

5- *Tokyo Godfathers*

Kon-sensei was a magician behind the camera. This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever, dealing with strained family relations, outcasts of society, urban abandonment, and the endurance of humanity against the elements. It's also friggin hilarious and heartfelt. If you haven't, you absolutely must check this one out, regardless if it's Christmas or the depths of summer.

thanks for reading my thoughts. peace and love."

24572,"My list might seem casual to some, maybe even controversial, but hey, whatever.

1. **[Sword Art Online](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online) -** It may not have been my first anime, but it was certainly the one that left the biggest impact on me. I fell in love with its worlds, the characters, the story, everything about it appealed to me, and it helped me get out of a pretty low period of my life, and because of that will likely always be my favorite as a result.

2. **[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) -** To this day there hasn't been a show that made me feel like I had truly followed a journey like this one had. It felt huge and had a fantastic cast of characters that were a joy to watch. 

3. **[Cowboy Bebop](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) -** I can't help myself, Cowboy Bebop just had to go on my list. Easily the best English dub of any anime IMO, and the stories are all so great. Still holds up so well after two decades.

4. **[Azumanga Daioh](https://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh) -** The best slice-of-life anime of all time from my perspective, and the show that made me love this genre. Such a memorable cast and incredibly funny. The manga is also fantastic, and probably my favorite 4-koma.

5. **[Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) -** This is a show that I watched once, and that was enough for me. I'd felt so emotionally torn by this show, and I fucking loved it.

6. **[Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33206/Kobayashi-san_Chi_no_Maid_Dragon) -** IMO, the best show KyoAni has ever made. It's adorable, gorgeous to watch, and has such a wonderful and endearing cast, and the stories itself were so pleasant to watch. Season 2 when?

7. **[Trigun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) -** My second favorite space western following Bebop, it's kinda hard to explain what exactly made it work so well for me. It just had so much that worked for what I was looking for, from an engaging story and characters, some great animation, and also having a pretty damn good dub.

8. **[Kemono Friends](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33089/Kemono_Friends) -** I think this one just surprised me with how good it actually was. Just on the surface, it seems like it should be a total bomb, and yet it had a truly endearing and engaging cast and a surprisingly dark story and world. I had such a good time watching, and it's truly a show that proves you can't judge a book by its cover.

9. **[Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) -** Probably the best execution of time travel I've ever seen in any medium. It felt like a mindfuck, but the best kind where it bends your brain but doesn't lose you. It's also IMO the best character that J. Michael Tatum has ever dubbed.

10. **[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist) -** One of the first shows that I started when I was getting into anime, it's another show that's hard to explain why I loved it, but just that it all came together in a packaged the I felt was fantastic to watch."

Log Horizon (hope they continue it at some point)

Naruto"
24577,"Top 5 just got shook up by a seasonal so let's go!

1 Simoun

Simoun's theme is really complexly built as it organically makes it ms characters wonder what they will leave behind when they're gone. ""We were here"" is triumphantly sprawled across the epic story as each character changes by astronomical units of development. There is a ton of social criticism, and for 2006 the show was amazingly progressive and would still be considered progressive if released now. 

2 Now and Then, Here and There

A gallery of inhumane cruelty and pain unfolds as the shounen hero is deconstructed trying to find place for hope. All he finds is the price of blind optimism. Despite all the suffering, there's a cold distance portraying a tinge of melancholy - you know Shu is wrong, but you wish he was right. The setpiece scenes of this anime will churn your stomach and ache your heart, but will bring you to tears as you realise the depth of it all.

3 Shirobako

What if... your dreams were just too difficult to find? What if they're more complex than you imagined and you're just not cut out for it? Shirobako tests a huge cast of characters as they find who they are and where they are going, but the strength of the show lies in its maturity. Adult characters bark a snappy, witty script as character development is fine tuned to an art of efficiency. The series' unique direction is the star of the finest moments, exploring history and creation of the entire animation medium as it goes along.

4 A Place Farther Than The Universe

Yes it literally just ended but... wow. This is what inspiration looks like. Never inciting a feeling of jealousy, the characters find the beautiful youth they sought after in the most unexpected of ways, and learn and develop by huge proportions.

5 Candy Boy

Twincest lesbian sisters uhm. Who knew it could be so sweet while managing an undercurrent of bitterness to their situation? It's really a couple learning to refind that spark, but it's also that first spark. It's a bit different, but surprising as it bends tropes or invents entirely new and charming directions to its whim of exploring its tricky subject matter."
24578,"1) Higurashi - My favorite anime psychological thriller. I loved the unique take on story telling. 

2)Death Note (till episode 26 I think)- L 

3) Mirai Niki - another really nice psychological thriller with some great wtf mind blown moments . 

4) Steins Gate - really nice narrative, a bit slow at first but it helps develop the characters which comes in handy when everything goes to shit.

5) Madoka Magika  - The series was really good but what really got me to love the series is the ever so controversial movie . 

6) Shinsekai Yori - Another unique psychological thriller set in a dystopic future . Loved the portrayal of the world and how society had evolved.

7) Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso - made me cry for the only other time besides when I watched violet evergarden episode 10. 

8) If I was to include a manga which will eventually be adapted into the 3rd and 4th season of it's anime then Nanatsu No Taizai - Escanor is my favorite anime/manga character of all time so there is no way I would miss out on mentioning him."
24579,"1. Code Geass - Simply because when I was starting off watching anime, it was one that grabbed my attention and brought me along for an amazing ride.
2. Death Note - The cold and calculating mindset of light was a pleasure to watch.
3. Clannad After Story - I was not ready for the feels.
4. Hunter X Hunter 2011 - Amazing story, with great character progression. The abilities and powers are really well explained.
5. Steins Gate - As it progresses along you get really attached to the characters"
24580,"These 10 come to my mind, but honestly, my preferences change depending on the mood I’m on at a given moment. 

1- Neon Genesis Evangelion. What can I say? I love how the “chosen Hero” trope arc gets in the way of Shinji’s development, and how the anime challenges us to go through his process of self-discovery and acceptance. 

2- Princess Mononoke. I actually like this one more than Spirited Away, the impact it’s dark imagery an beautiful designs left on my child memories is still very present, and on re-watch I apperciate how it cared about creating complex characters with particular needs instead of using the lazy “hoomans bad, animals gud” routine.

3- Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu/Legend of the Galactic Heroes. After an eternity in my PTW list, I picked up this and damn, I was not prepared. This show is massive, and not only because of it’s lenght: it has a plethora of well-written characters with their own story arcs and interactions, great battles with war tactics, political intrigues, and far more fun I expected.

4- Ghost in the Shell. I really specially liked the quiet moments where the story came to us visually, instead of by dialogue.

5- Monster. Many say that the story could have been told in less episodes, but for me every single second of this show adds up, it was never about chasing Johan but about wandering the environment that created him and knowing the people that populates it.

6- Paprika. It manages to deliver the feel of belivable craziness only found in dreams.

7- Madoka Magica. I have my masochist side, I guess. I’m not very familiar with the magical girl genre so I struggled to identify some elements at first, but realizing how the tropes about power of firendship and such were affected by Urobuchi’s filter was a hell of a ride. 

8- Jin-Roh. Watched this movie with zero prior knowledge aside from the cover, I actually came expecting ultra-violent schlock. Well, I stand corrected.

9- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan. This show feels like a constant climax, only it just keeps getting even more intense every second. Form the writing, to the animation, to the score and acting, every little element overflows energy at every moment.

10- JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. On a critic mindset I probably would not give this spot to JoJo’s, specially given how many phenomenal animes I have not mentioned, but honestly this show resonates with me personally more than any other does. It’s the perfect balance between over the top insanity and legitimally compelling characters and stories, the constant changes and unrestrained creativity keeps it fresh and full of possibilities, and I just love combat based on mind battles and tricks."

24582,"Lol, that seriously laugh.

I hope you’re joking :)"
24583,"Urara Meirochou - Beautiful world. Amazing sound track. Really unique. Absolutely adorable.    

K-On!! - Took what K-On set up and ran with it. Amazing feels. Love the girls. The slow build up over two cours and the finale was breath taking and I still cry to this day.    

Hidamari Sketch - All-    
It's hard to rank this one as S1, S2 and so far S3 have all been 10/10. The art style is fantastic. Bringing realistic items into the anime. The characters feel real. Everything that happens feels like it could happen tomorrow. Everything is just nice and simple. The OST is perfect. One of the best SoL/CGDDCT I've seen.  

The Haruhi movie... Hard to explain without spoilers. But 10/10.    

Non Non Biyori S2.   
One of the most beautiful anime I've seen. Soundtrack is comfy and brings out the country vibe. This takes S1 but gets a bit more comedy in it, but gives us some of the best character bonding backstory I've ever witnessed. This is such a relaxing, adorable time. Little slow for some but I never felt bored with any of it."
24584,"1. Detective Conan - Kinda way too long and 10 years past its prime but there's never been another anime series that's put out as much stuff that I enjoy to the degree I do with Conan. And never a series I've been obsessed with the way I was with it around 2008.

2. Haruhi - The anime that made me an anime fan beyond whatever I found on American tv. Absolutely blew my mind when I first watched it, is still utterly brilliant for much of its 2 season and a movie run (especially the movie).

3. One Piece - The other best long running anime. I love it for the same reasons everyone does, but I will say, I've done a terrible job of actually watching later parts of it. Regardless, it's still everything good about long running shonen.

4. Welcome to the NHK - The most genuine, horrifically real anime. Or at least the best in that genre for my tastes. And I love its use of comedy that is so sad and miserable it stops being fun and starts becoming sadder than any more serious series.

5. The World God Only Knows - The best harem series, by being way more than a harem series. So incredibly good at getting me emotionally invested that I honestly feel like it made me more emotionally invested in series I saw later. It had that big an impact on me."
24585,Woah detective conan!! I used to watch it on tv like 10 years ago!! Is it worth watching again at my age? (18)
24586,"If you have the time and ignore most of the filler episodes, sure."
24587,"In no particular order, here's seven.

1. I said no particular order, but Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has to come first. It's hard to put into words why I love FMAB. The story, the setting, the mix of magic and technology, the intrigue, the music, the animation - it's great. Plus, it has the distinction of being one of two shows that has made me cry. The first time I watched it, [this scene](https://vimeo.com/262321586) hit me right in the feels. 

2. Samurai 7. A sci-fi twist on a classic story. It's certainly not most people's favorite, but awesomeness is in the eye of the beholder. I love me some samurai.

3. Chrno Crusade. The second anime to make me cry. Dat ending. If an anime can move my black and shriveled heart, I've got to mention it Also, this and Samurai 7 are both animated by Gonzo. That's not why they're my favorites, but it's a ""fun"" bit of trivia.

4. Ghost in the Shell. I love me some cyberpunk, and GitS was the first cyberpunk anime I watched. It's such an amazing world. And the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARTLckN9e7I) is phenominal. 

5. I'll say Castle in the Sky, but that doesn't mean that I don't love the rest of Studio Ghibli's films. If anime is a mistake, I don't want to be correct. I mean, show me the non-anime film with floating castles, robots, a princess, flying ships, pirates, and Mark Hamill. Well, that's Star Wars, but other than that. Seriously, tell me if there's another movie with these elements, let me know because I want to watch it. And again, I must cite the breathtaking [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRNqLRL1_RY). Damn, that's beautiful.

6. The [Monogatari series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari). It's ~~difficult~~ impossible to describe, but it's amazing. I'm not sure who the art director is, but they deserve an award. Love it.

7. It's not done yet, but Death March. It's got a stupid name (I mean, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody? Seriously?), but other than that, I love it. MC is OP, yet having a high level skill doesn't necessarily mean you *know* how to do something. For example, he's got Max level fire magic but can't chant any of the spells. Plus, it's funny. He's surrounded by a (mostly) loli harem but isn't attracted to any of them. So he sneaks out and goes to brothels. I like it so much that I went and read the manga and have started the web novel. I've never done that before."
24588,"Movies included? It's hard for me to compare movies and shows but here are my top 2 shows and top 3 movies:

- Cowboy Bebop - Classic, phenomenal characters, amazing balance of tone, S-tier music...with the exception of Ep21, there isn't a single episode less than great, and at least several (5, 11, 12-13, 20, 22-26, etc.) that are downright masterpieces on their own.
- Gintama - This show basically sidesteps every problem I've ever had with any anime ever. So many of its merits defy logic. It's one of those special works that can make you laugh your head off one moment, then bawl your eyes out 20 minutes later.
- Spirited Away
- Princess Mononoke
- Porco Rosso

Yeah, my top 3 anime movies are all Ghibli. But hey, it's the truth for me. Even the phenomenal Your Name and Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya can't touch these three films in my mind."
24589,"1.  Log Horizon - I've spent a lot of time playing Runescape during my teen years, and I really liked how this series approached the ""stuck in a game"" theme. Shiroe was relatable to me (even to the point of being in a similar college program before he was trapped in the game), and I enjoyed the politics and strategizing rather than the action or harem sort of elements common to the genre.
2. Wagnaria!!  (Specifically S3, but the series overall really). - Funny, relatable, and despite the ""Inami punches Souta"" gag getting old during the first season, it definitely improved for the second and third and finally getting closure on most of the couples in the final season was so satisfying.
3. Re:CREATORS - The Reverse Isekai was an interesting concept and I enjoyed the ride the entire way even though the ending was a little bit of an ass-pull imo.
4. Aria the Animation - I would have put Yuru Camp here, but I haven't finished watching it. Max comfy, relaxing show to help unwind after a busy work day. Also the OP/ED are SO GOOD
5. Urara Meirochou - Kon best girl, fite me.

Honorable mentions: 91 Days, Fate/Zero, Shirobako - All definitely worth the watch"
24590,"1. Rainbow -excellent show about the creation of a frendship in a harsh environment

2. Made in Abyss - pure adventure and great world building

3. Now and then, here and there - fantastic coming of age show 

4. Gurren Lagann - the fights get so intense it's crazy, and it still makes you care about the characters

5. Monogatari series - The style, story telling, writing and I like the whole idea of the show

6. School Live - Horror, yet makes you smile and laugh. But becomes very serious as well

7. Arakawa under the bridge - Shaft style comedy. The people living under the bridge seem so awesome I would live with them if they were real

8. Shinsekai Yori - Amazing world, the main reason why I liked it is a spoiler

9. New Game - Fun, happy show about cute girls making video games. And I love videogames lol

10. Kino no Tabi (2003) - physolophical show about a girl and her bike seeing the world and experience all that it has to offer, the good and the bad.

I need to reformat as I would like to add Sora Yori from this season into the list, and maybe Girl's Last Tour and Anohana now that I think about it. Also really liked Tsuki ga Kirie (most likely spelled wrong)"
24591,"1. Berserk-
This got me into anime and helped develop a taste for good story telling. In particular the parallels of Guts wondering what to do in life and who he is is something I can relate to.

2. Monogatari series-
This series can be confusing but it explains things pretty well at the end of each arc. I always enjoyed that the Mc learned what was going on when I did.

3. Highschool DxD-
I don't need a reason.

4. Oregairu-
Like alot of people I can relate to the Mc but I wouldn't go to the lengths he does to help people.

5. One Piece-
I feel like most of my love for one piece died 300 eps ago but those first 500 were some of my favorite parts of anime."

24594,"For me it is:

1. K-ON! - Great animation about drinking tea and making fun of used jokes. It has its unique charm, especially in the last episodes.

2. Kino's Journey: the Beautiful World - it's hard to explain. It's describes differences in societies and laws through journey on talking motorcycle. It's philosophical slice of life.

3. Devilman Crybaby - amazing style and storytelling. I love those surreal sequences of pure brutality or insanity.

4. Planetarian: the Reverie of a Little Planet - beautiful, subtle and moving. It's also really short (5 episodes).

5. Monster - great plot; many characters with individual traits, story, and purpose."

4.GOOD"
24598,"Few the most popular and well received shows:

**[Steins;Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7BILZcYAY)**. If you like Sci-Fi you should definitely check. Best time travel show out there with perfectly executed story and subplot romance. Keep in mind that it has slow first half that is very important build up. 

**[Clannad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHdZOKm5xzo) + [Clannad: After Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMJxT3O9qA)**.  It's probably the most unique romance out there and probably the only that doesn't end on confession and goes far beyond high school, explores struggles of adulthood and many other related things. 

It is sad as fuck from time to time but it's also inspiring and heartwarming as hell and often makes you look for some event's from other angle. 

**[Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2GujJZfXpg)** movie.  Gorgeous animation and art, great story, beautiful music and good entry for everybody.

**[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsOlhzPEfY)/[Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uq34TeWEdQ)**. Best first option for new people.  Great epic story with dark elements, interesting and phylosophical themes, great world building and tons of great characters. If you have time - Watch original FMA first, make some break and then watch brotherhood. If no then only Brotherhood. 2003 version went anime original after some point because manga was still ongoing while brotherhood is full canon adaptation but they are still totally different stories that both deserve watching. 

**[Attack On Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMXgHfHxKVM)** Relatevely recent, very popular show. Just look the opening, it's best way to describe the show. Gorgeous art, animation and style, pretty dark with interesting story. 

**[Shinsekai Yori.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz1ypuGJ3VM)** Show about post apocalyptic world, but in not usual post 
apocalyptic setting. There are a lot of philosophic and psychological things along with interesting story and some very interesting plot twists. 

**[Parasyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm8UjBAS3cs)** Interesting story, a lot of gore, some romance. Very interesting to keep track of how main character changes during the whole show

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt26CSwCNao)** This is mystery thriller in detective style with pretty interesting story. It also has some pretty violent scenes.

**[Made In Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91G8m9uM_0)** Don't be fooled by art style of the show, it's not happy children on happy adventure show. Probably the darkest show of this year(well, 2017 :P). Has very interesting story and world building.

**[Cowboy Bebop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)** Personally I didn't like it a lot but this is indeed classic, it's really atmospheric and at some point you should definitely watch it.


**[Hunter x Hunter \(2011\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faqmNf_fZlE)** It's your not usual shounen.The show has pretty interesting story and surprisingly likable*(no matter how strange this may sound)* villains. It's worth all it's ~150 episodes.


**[Spice and Wolf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw)** Very calm and beautiful show in medieval setting that follows adventures of traveling merchant and his wise wolf :).


**[Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C337shIT9LI)** Pretty popular and very unique show. Hard to describe it, it has comedy, slice of life, sci-fi, ~~Hitler~~ and one of the best male characters with his inner beautiful sarcastic monologue. Also sequel movie is masterpiece.

**[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wPbJlFBUw)** Probably the best hype show out there."
24599,"I think Symphogear and Kill la Kill do hype better than Gurren Lagann, but Gurren Lagann is more widely appreciated."
24600,Great list. Would highly recommend all these series!!!
24601,Very solid list
24602,"A bunch of favourites that I would check out not on your MAL or anilist. Openings/trailers are linked to give you a feel for the show.

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series with animation that holds up amazing well today. It also had one of the best endings in anime in my opinion. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well-regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that.  (recommend the dub as a sub watcher)

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime. Film is just basically about this massive death race and has some of the best animation ever.

[Redline Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Action comedy about a psychic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city while he learns to grow as a person.

[Mob Psycho 100 OP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpApXzwAP0&index=2&list=FLsNBO_i0YOwmyoaxjB-AZ7g&t=0s)


- Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) Teens are forced to fight for the survival of mankind against monsters known as Angels. Quite a few themes like a look at the writer's ongoing depression play a huge role in the series (make sure you watch the film End of Evangelion for the ending)

[Neon Genesis Evangelion OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU21rCWkuJw)

- Shirobako/Bakuman (2014) (2010) An anime literally about making anime and an anime/manga about making manga and all the ins and outs of both industries.

[Shirobako OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46zFe7lwRM)

[Bakuman S2 OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkEQ58iMmNg)


- March Comes in Like A Lion (2016) Deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion S2 OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOK6DiZw1M)

- Ghost in the Shell (Film 1995) (SAC 2002) Film is more philosophical taking a look at human consciousness and what it means to be human. SAC is more of a straight up crime drama.

[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG  OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (2016) Really good period drama about the art of rakugo (a form of theater/storytelling) and the various characters attempts to preserve it from the various hardships around them as well as use it as a source of confidence and identity.

[Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu S2 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1HjJfGt_xk)

- Made in Abyss (2017) Kids have to survive in a descending pit as they ward off the many things that want to viciously murder them. Some amazing world building and beautiful movie level backdrops and animation and world building down to just understanding how the ecosystem of the abyss works. (warning does have some graphic content involving children viewer discretion is advised)

[Made in Abyss Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4gyYjpL4ME)

- A Silent Voice (2016) Deals with redemption group think, bullying, living with a disability and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and an unbelievable soundtrack. I would also read the manga after finishing it (as the movie skips over stuff).

[A Silent Voice Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK6UgLra7g)


- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting an enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series after seeing the films overture covers the first two episodes better) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

 [Legend of the Galactic Heroes OP 3]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hryo6H57y6I) 

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime. Has some interesting views on society mainly dealing with the issue of an over monitored  state. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Q4emwDFYg&index=1&list=PLAbghykhSTZPNEqvWnC8ZuAEU_PazwJZm)

- Ping Pong the Animation (2014) Great sports series about aspiring Ping Pong pros and the hardships they go through great animation and music with a very different rougher art style that looks great in the matches. Incredible character development in a very short 11 episode span.

[Ping Pong Trailer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgPGtZH0EjQ)"

24605,What anime have you seen?
24606,[https://myanimelist.net/animelist/dewoo](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/dewoo)
24607,"So it looks like you have mainly stuck to the basic shounen and senien which is pretty common starting out I would suggest branching out into some different genres such as comedy or romance or just slice of life

I would suggest some things like March comes like a lion, clannad, your lie in april, bunny girl senpai, the monogatori series, made in abyss, Haikyu (trust me sports anime are dope), and death parade 

Although some of those more mellow types of anime aren't for everyone if you want to watch whatever anime is currently airing and has the word isekai in the title go ahead and enjoy that."
24608,Gundam is complicated. There’s multiple timelines.
24609,"Gundam isn't really complicated all you need is the watch order for UC and the other stuff you can watch standalone.

This was my UC watch order which went fine

0079 > The Origin > One Year War Side Stories (War in the Pocket, MS Team, Thunderbolt optional stand alones but some of the best Gundam content out there) > Stardust Memory (optional personally really didn't like it) > Zeta > ZZ > Char's Counterattack > Unicorn"
24610,"there is really only 1 actual timeline. the rest are stand alone series with 1-2 seasons and their own lore and typically have some major themes and symbols in common. conflict over rights between people from space(space colonies and other planets) and people from earth, some children stumbling into giant robots and being the best pilots ever, and [and almost always blonde guy who shows up as 2 characters one as himself the other as an alter ego with a fancy mask.](https://www.memesmonkey.com/images/memesmonkey/bc/bcc94d208482e08616e2a7f6b3dce04c.jpeg)

24619,What is Re:Zero about? Also kudos on Gintama being no.1. No other anime can make me laugh like that.
24620,"Ohhhh man! Surprised you haven’t heard of re:zero. It’s an Isekai (genre where main character gets transported to another world). He meets this lady then dies, getting reset to a certain point in time. This happens again and again till he realizes and it’s his sick journey. Rlly awesome thriller but it might be high because I watched it with little exp. I don’t doubt that you’ll enjoy it. Give it a shot!"
24621,Is it like Konosuba? I'm watching that now. Re:Zero isn't comedy right?

Next on the list to watch are:

Konosuba


One Punch Man"
24643,Good list enjoy jojos bizarre adventure it’s gonna be soo good.
24644,Go to myanimelist.net and check top anime. Go down from there based on what looks coolest to you
24645,This the only reply. Any other replies are inferior.
24646,"What sort of shows/movie genres do you like or what are some of your interests? This would help greatly in recommdations. What is it that you like about bleach? The animation style, characters, ghosts, swords, etc.?"
24647,"Here is [the recommendation chart](https://i.imgur.com/q9Xjv4p.jpg) that is usually linked by bot-chan. I think it is a good way to find shows to watch for a beginner, though you should also have a look at [MyAnimeList's Top Anime](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php)."
24648,"How are you liking bleach so far? It would be easier to recommend a good anime if I know what you're into. Romance? Gore? Action? HunterxHunter, dead note, dead man wonderland and made in abyss are some good animes in my opinion, it's a good small list to start you off 👍 death note is on YouTube I believe."
24649,I really like gore and action
24650,"Crunchyroll has a number of great shows that are free to stream. If you already have Netflix or Amazon Prime those services will give you access to some excellent shows as well.

Some suggestions if you are enjoying Bleach are

- My Hero Academia 
- Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood
- Gurren Lagann
- Hunter x Hunter(2011)
- Madoka Magica (watch at least thru episode 3)
- One Punch Man
- Mob Psycho 100
- Cowboy Bebop
- Trigun 
- Yuu-Yuu Hakusho (similar in theme to Bleach) 
- Soul Eater( also shares some similarly with Bleach) 
- Kill La Kill 

Descriptions of all these shows can be found on Myanimelist.net 

Additionally if you haven't seen it yet, I would also take a look at Avatar the Last Airbender. There is some controversy whether it should be considered an anime, but ignoring that the show is one of the absolute best shows ever produced."
24651,"Bleach went down with the fillers

Though I must say ive never seen fillers I want to watch though, more than half the time it was interesting actually"
24652,"I suggest creating a anime list; so that way you can add stuff you want to see, remember stuff that you've seen as you watch more stuff, et cetra. (You can create one at myanimelist.net or anilist.co; both are free).

I also highly suggest keeping an open mind to a variety of different genres; just because you never know if you'll like it or not, if you don't try it.

As for recommendations:

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

Hunter x Hunter 2011

My Hero Academia

Assassination Classroom

Steins; Gate (some people don't like the anime until episode 10 or 11 and think it gets better then, but I liked the whole thing).

Re Zero: Starting Life in Another World

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (Don't judge just watch, at least 
watch until episode 3 before judging).

Made in Abyss (Don't judge just watch)

there).

Psycho-Pass (I personally didn't like the second season as much, but liked the first season)

Cowboy Bebop

One Punch Man

Konosuba 

Death Note (I didn't like the second half of the anime as much, but enjoyed the first half).

Akatsuki no Yona (Warning anime has cliffhanger ending, but I 
personally really enjoyed it).

people miss it)

24833,"Toby Maguire by a good mile; Although, Hollan might surpass him depending on what he and his team can offer in the next spiderman movie. Let's just not mention Garfield, he tried his best.

Never really understood why everyone liked the idea that Spiderman needs to be teenager. Holland makes spiderman look cool and fun, but he just looks too childish doing it. Why not just call him spiderboy rather than spiderman? It just doesn't feel right. Toby's first movie gave him this aura of maturity without making him look too childish. 

We'll see in the next movie if he's good enough to not need Ironman's baby sitting services, then maybe we can call him spiderman."
24834,I'm with you!
24835,You should probably pose the question after you watch Homecoming. Tom Holland is the best so far. He actually looks and sounds like a kid who so desperately wants to be a superhero. They really nailed it casting that kid. Not just as Spidey but as a very likable and relatable Peter Parker.
24836,"Agreed, I just noticed the DVD was out and I still haven't seen it.  I will check it out in the next few days.  I'm sure it's in RedBox."
24837,Tom Holland.  He actually looks young enough for the role and was also excellent too.
24838,I think Tom Holland has a chance to pull into the lead.  The jury is still out.
24839,How can you say the jury is still out when you haven’t seen the film?
24840,"You are correct, Sir!  I will see it tonight.  I have a copy."
24841,"I think Tom Holland quips the best, which is a non-negligible part of Spidey's character."
24842,He is pretty good at that!  But I'm not sure if they let they let the whole 'innocent' side develop as well.  That is why I am giving it time before I pass final judgement.
24843,"Tobey Maquire was my Spider-Man growing up. 

But I strongly feel he should have no issue handing this role to Tom Holland who I think is the perfect blend between Spider-Man and Peter Parker. 


While we are talking about it, does anyone else agree that the Vulture characters was easily Marvels best villian thus far. 

I would say even better than Loki because he is complex. We know he is the bad guy, but he isn't a bad person. He is just a blue collar guy trying to take care of his own. Even the one person he killed was a total accident. 

Thoughts?"
24844,Christopher Barnes
24845,Awesome!  I guess I'm a bit older than you.  I lean towards Ted Schwartz on that front.  :D
24846,Tom Holland. He fit the role and played it so perfectly. Very likable
24847,"You will like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ty87ZpGN00).  They agree completely with you.

But Tobey Maguire brought him from cartoon to reality better than anyone else for the first time.  He had the biggest challenge.  And everyone after that, just had to match him."
24848,"Andrew Garfield.

Tobey Maguire never really made me believe he was a New-Yorker and Tom Holland is way too happy for a kid whose beloved uncle was murdered."
24849,"Uncle Ben getting murdered isn't part of the backstory in Homecoming, so that version of Spider-man wouldn't have that emotional baggage to carry around."
24850,"I have a theory that uncle Ben didn't die in the Homecoming universe. He just left May after he found out she was a huge hoe by fucking a black guy while he was supposedly away on a business trip. Also, uncle Ben in this universe is Asian, because diversity."
24851,"Those people that are Andrew Garfield fans are probably the same subset that would enjoy that line of comics.  

But I don't think he captures 70's or 80's spidey as well."
24852,"Ironically, I hated what Brian Michael-Bendis did with the material."
24853,"Really!  So you hated the book series, but liked the movie version with Andrew Garfield.  I thought those movies were based off of Bendis' work.  I might be off.

So you identified with the character.  He was more of a modern day youth.  More of a millenial character than previous spiderman versions."
24854,"The Marc Webb movies borrow some of the better story elements from the early 2000s run of Ultimate comics; primarily Oscorp being at the center of everything and “Venom” being developed by Richard Parker instead of simply being an alien from outer space. Although those were fun ideas, Bendis had a great deal of terrible concepts as well (e.g. Norman Osborne literally transforms into a green goblin, Carnage is a mindless clone of Richard Parker, Mary-Jane is Peter’s first and only girlfriend).

I identified with Andrew Garfield’s take on the character as an outsider. I could relate to Tobey Maquire’s quiet nature, but Tom Holland just feels a little too Disney."
24855,You make several good points here.
24856,"Garfield was a terrific Spider-Man, but my least favorite Peter Parker. Hipster douchebag Peter Parker is honestly so far removed from how he should be.

I accept it as an alternative vision for the character, I read lots of comics, I'm used to this sort of thing (I really liked Lex in BvS for example). But there were points where I couldn't see the core of the character anymore.

But as far as Spiderman goes, he nailed the quippyness and the energy."
24857,it's either tom holland or tobey maguire. andrew garfield sucked
24858,"You can't blame Andrew Garfield.  It was a different series of Spider man comics.  And Spidey was all mopey in that series.

But I'm with you."
24859,well i guess it wasn't andrew garfield's fault. but the producers and the director and the writers made his chararacter terrible
24860,"I agree.  I don't know why they made that movie.  That line of comics was seriously unpopular with fans.

When I found that out, I no longer held that against Andrew Garfield.  He has been perfect in everything else he was in.  He was awesome in the Social Network.  He made the whole story human, and relatable."
24861,"Shinji Todo. 

I mean, come on, he had a spidercar that turned into a giant robot."
24862,"Ha!  I got to admit, that is value added.  I must have missed that series.  

:D"
24863,"Tom Holland at playing both parts, but Maguire was very good at making Peter Parker more than a caricature."
24864,Yeah!  He was really 3 dimensional!
24865,I loved Toby in the original trilogy but Tom Holland does it so well. His nerdy voice and enthusiasm is so good in homecoming.
24866,"I agree 100%

They did some great casting!

Tobey actually transformed the role tho.  TH only had to mimic Tobey.

Just a thought."
24867,Tobey Maguire is the best Spider-Man.
24868,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zOtpeYERu9w
24869,"Yes, best includes coolest."
24871,"Tom Holland is undoubtedly the best. Give that a watch and post back here with your opinion. I'm pretty sure you'll feel the same way. All the adjectives you used to describe Maguire, Holland pulls it off better imo."
24872,"I'm becoming a big fan of Tom Holland.

 But he had 2 others to follow."
24873,"Be that as it may, you did ask who was best, not who was first."
24874,"I'm watching Homecoming now.  I agree, Tom Holland does it best.  

But the transition from cartoon to reality was done by Maguire."
24875,"Well technically the transition from cartoon to reality was first done by Nicholas Hammond. If we're going to give credit for doing it first, it should go to him since he did it 30 years prior. 

But doing it first doesn't earn points in my book, doing it right does. I personally liked Garfield more than Maguire, even though Garfield's Peter Parker isn't the Peter Parker I imagine.  But at least he portrayed a version of Peter Parker that's established (ultimate).  Maguire's Parker didn't feel like any established Peter Parker.  It didn't feel like Peter  Parker at all.  I love Toby Maguire as an actor, but I think his portrayal was by far the worst.  This is coming from someone who thinks Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man movie(if only by a little bit).

Of course these are just my opinions, I respect yours."
24876,I disagree he was the worst Spider-Man ever
25351,"1. None of them really, but I’ll say Tobey Maguire.  He felt the most accurate.

2. Tom Holland.  Love his jokes and enthusiasm as Spidey.  

3. Andrew Garfield.  Love his spider-like movements

4. Andrew Garfield, no question.  That opening to his second movie was great.

5. Toney Maguire. Harry, Jameson, Aunt May...all great.

6. Andrew Garfield.  His reactions to Uncle Ben / Gwen dying are so emotional.  

7. Tobey Maguire.  He had good character development each movie.

8.  Probably Maguire for Spider-Man 2, but I do have a lot of fun with Homecoming

9. Andrew Garfield, for the death of Gwen Stacy

10. Andrew Garfield for the ASM2 theme

11. Tom Holland.  I love his performances, just hate the writing for his movies.  He would make a perfect traditional Spider-Man."
25352,Just came here to say that Tom Holland Spider-Man cAnt fight for shit   .  Then again john watts besides that mysterio scene hasn’t really created any memorable sequences
25353,"Yeah I think they really should put in an fighter like they did in Spider-Man 2 in the suit. The fights in the newer ones look generic and could have been handled better, especially for Spider-Man."
25354,"&#x200B;

1. Garfield is like Peter Parker straight out of comicbook pages, in terms of his personality. But Maguire is certainly feels more likable and easier to root for, so his Peter works better for a movie adaptation, I guess.
2. Garfield, no question
3. Garfield and Maguire
4. Garfield 100%
5. Both Garfield and Tobey had a great supporting cast, but I prefer Maguire's
6. Garfield is objectively the best actor out of 3, so that's an easy win for him
7. Well, we all know that Emma was the best, so Garfield wins
8. Tobey
9. Also Tobey
10. Tobey and Garfield
11. As I said above, Garfield looks like Peter Parker from the comics."
25355,"Peter wasn't a good looking guy just like Stan Said. Peter is more like erm ""cute"" no homo. Andrew is straight up a model 🗿 he's the most handsome looking Spider-Man of the 3.

7. Is really debatable as a written love interest Mary Jane definitely takes the cake."
25356,"Well, he actually was. And he always depicted as such. I mean, even when Gwen was first introduced, her initial thoughts about Peter were how handsome he was. I think that says something. Or Liz, who admitted to have a crush on him and being too shy to talk to him.

&#x200B;

 7. I wouldn't say so. She was really poorly written in the trilogy. Now, I know Gwen wasn't quite a great written character, but she definitely felt more like a living person and she was likable. And she was played by Emma Stone too."
25357,"Yeah handsome but not a straight up model face like maybe MJ or something. Peter is not ugly but neither is Tobey or Tom. Andrew is just way too handsome if you ask me.

How is Mary Jane poorly written? Need some explaination on that matter because that's what most people tend to say but that's subjective. What's your reason behind it."
25358,"Well, apparently not just ""handsome"" if his look was the first thing Gwen (who was depicted as the ""beauty queen"") noticed about him.   
Tobey isn't ugly, but he looks too ""simple"" for Peter Parker. And Tom is fine, but if you ask me who does the classic Peter resembles the most, the answer definitely is Garfield IMO  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfCAHeRUEAEYsL0?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfCAHeRUEAEYsL0?format=jpg&name=small)

They may not look completely alike, obviously, but he certainly closer than the others.   
So yeah, Peter is suppose to have a really good look, hence why all his troubles with the girls are not because of them not finding him attractive but because of his hero job. And a ""model face"" as you called him, feels exactly right, if you ask me.

And also, TNAS Spider-Man looks like Garfield as well lol.

&#x200B;

And how's she not? She has no personal traits, she's bland, her backstory wasn't explored, her relatioship with Peter weren't explored that much as well, we don't know what Peter even liked her for other than for her looks, not to mention she played the role of a damsel in distress 3 times in the first movie alone."
25359,"No Personality traits? That's a lie. Her backstory is literally there to see and was made obvious, if you're too blind to see it, then that's your problem and subjective. Her relationship with Peter was non existent in the highschool years because they skipped this development. (Besides they only really connected in his college years anyways, in the comics too).

She was pretty and he obviously always liked her because of her looks just like in the comics bruh again, your criticism is subjective because it was established that he loved her from the beginning (and was narrated BY HIMSELF). Being a damsel is nothing bad at all in a superhero movie that's again, subjective criticism and not bad writing at all."

25361,"Huh? Her character being poorly written is a commonly accepted fact about the trilogy. I don't get it why does it surprise you.

Yes, she has no traits and no individuality. She's really bland and her character is non-existent .  
Her backstory is there, yes, but I said it wasn't explored that much.  
Her relationship with Peter weren't properly explored even after the graduation. What we saw was a couple of poorly written cliche romantic dialogues.

Except he wasn't in love with her in the comics. He find her extremely beautiful and that's it. It wasn't until much later when he found out that there's actually a character in her.   
It's fine on it's own, but not when it becomes a trope that is repeated in every movie again and again."
25362,"Again saying generally accepted (just like generally most people don't find Holland's movies good) doesn't mean that it's subjective.

Why are you lying in her having no TRAITS? She's not bland again that's subjective LMAO. So you admit it but now say it ain't explored too much? Just like about EVERY FEMALE LOVE INTEREST? HAHAHAHAHA At least it was shown how her life is.

After the graduation they didn't see each other again she probably moved out etc. because she was with Harry. Those rich people always chase her but she never settles down. What is poorly written? Dude you're being subjective as fuck here. Their romance is building in a form of 3 movies being cliche is a nitpick and subjective.

He definitely always had a thing for her that was developed throughout the movie. Again your part here is subjective just because she's getting saved doesn't mean that it's bad. Lmao"
25364,So you admit that your arguments were flawed? Just curious 😅
25365,"1. Andrew - Before y’all start tryna kill me. Andrew actually portrayed the anger that Peter had, because many Spider-Man fans tend to forget that high school Peter was actually somewhat of an asshole. 

He was anti social and straight up didn’t like people. Tobey is just a whiny bitch who lets people run over him. 

Holland’s has friends and in general people like him. 

Andrew’s Peter was actually an asshole, and stood up for himself. And despite popular belief, he was never “cool”, NEVER. He was always a loser. 

2. Andrew, talk shit to his enemies, blah blah blah we know the drill. 

3. Fights - TASM 2 Electro vs Spidey was beautiful to watch in 3D. 

4. Web-Swinging - Andrew, come on man, TASM 2 swinging is beautiful.

5. Supporting Cast - Tom? I guess. His MJ may not be “Mary Jane” but she acts the most like Comic MJ. Ned is basically Ganke, but I like Ganke so whatever. 

6. Acting - Andrew is the best actor of the 3 by far. He gave masterful performances, him by default. 

7. Best Written Love Interest - Gwen, by far. She did things, had character traits, actually stood up to Peter’s bullshit. Not to mention her death was truly tragic. Ironically she’s the most like Comic MJ out of all 3 love interests. 

8. Tobey - Spider-Man 2 is hard to beat. 

9. Tobey - Spider-Man 2 had “Spider-Man no more” it was beautiful. 

10. Theme - Spider-Man 2. The failure of being Spider-Man and just how fucking hard it is. 

11. Fitting actor for the role - Andrew. He’s what I always imagined Peter would look like. Skinny but lean, tallish but not NBA player like."
25366,"MJ never acts like comics MJ and if you believe that then you're pretty wrong. Mary Jane's Character actually is written well and just lacks little things like the extrovert persona that would make her the perfect MJ, she's still pretty close to the real MJ.

Michelle is barely a character and their romance was set up bad if you think their set up is good then you're objectively wrong because it happened off screen and was never even hinted at.

Just because Gwen does things doesn't mean that she's the better written love Interest. If you compare the writing to Tobey's and Kirsten's Relationship you actually see the development and it feels natural. The reveal was also written way better and more satisfying than the TASM movie.

The Fight with Doc Ock is definitely way better than TASM but the swinging in TASM 2 was the best ever in any movie."
25367,"MCU-MJ is based on Ultimate MJ I guess, who is herself very different from her 616-comic part. Tom Holland's Spider-Man takes a lot of the Ultimate Spider-Man-runs with Peter and Miles, which shows a more modern look on the life of a high schooling superhero. So I think the MCU-MJ somehow really fits in as Ultimate MJ."
25368,MCU MJ is nothing like 616 or Ultimate I'm sorry dude but that's straight up false.
25369,"Well, she has the sarcasm and the brain of Ultimate MJ. Of course there are differences between them."
25370,There are huge differences because they are not really the same.
25371,"Yeah, like with every single character in any comic book movie and their comic counterparts. That how it works, especially in the MCU. They're based on the characters, but not the same."
25372,"I mean, Raimi-MJ also had big differences to comic-MJ, so..."
25373,Watch my other comment where I pointed out the many things Raimi's MJ and Comics MJ have in common apart from looks.
25374,"Yeah, and here are some of the differences: slowed down the party girl-persona to make her more the girl-next-door-type (with is more Gwen's role), her being Peter's first love, all the flirtation and will-they-won't-they is dropped, Peter is from the beginning heel-over-head for her instead of realizing her qualities way later after  they're just friends, she's more of a alpha bitch, her tragic backstory is reduced to just fighting parents, her afrainess of getting married is not only slowed down but dropped to make her a run-away-bride in Spidey 2, the Peter-Spidey-MJ-love triangle is a nice nodd to the Richard-Donner-Superman-movies, but has nothing to do with the comics, etc."
25375,"1.	Andrew, he’s a cocky douche just like early Peter. I don’t like when he is portrayed as a goody two shoes, he’s not.
2.	Andrew, quips are on point
3.	Tobey had best fight scenes
4.	Andrew had best swinging scenes
5.	Tobey had perfect casting for most of the supporting roles
6.	Andrew is the best actor by far
7.	Andrew had best love interest by far
8.	Tobey has the best movie (SM2)
9.	Andrew had best comic recreation with the death of Gwen Stacy
10. Tobey, no question
11. Andrew

That’s 7 points for Andrew, 4 for Tobey, and 0 for Holland."
25376,Low-key W. Would give Civil War Peter the edge tho as a teenage Peter (only).

Winner:

Tobey Maguire

(short answer)

Best Spiderman: Tobey

Best Spiderteen: Andrew

Best Iron boy Jr: Tom"
25378,"1. Maguire
2. Holland, the quirky bull shit talking while he fights is one of my favorite aspects of comic Spidey and the MCU-Spidey does just that.
3. Maguire
4. Garfield
5. Maguire. Alone for JJJ, but it had the best Aunt May and the friendship and rivalry between Peter and Harry was great
6. I don't know. Have the feeling all three of them do act better in other roles to be honest. Especially Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but I never liked his Spidey-perfomance...
7. Garfield, helped Gwen was played by Emma Stone who has great chemistry with Garfield. And I like they modernized comic Gwen and gave her some personality of MJ (especially as this Gwen knew Peter was Spidey from the begin of their relationship)
8. Maguire, no doubt
9. Maguire (Spider-Man: No More in Spider-Man 2)
10. Maguire
11. Would say Holland. He's more young looking and seems more likely to be a high schooler than the other ones and has this nerdy touch. Maguire's Peter was written better, but I think Holland looks more the part. And he just loves playing Spidey.

Bonus by me, adding two points:
- costume: Garfield, the one of ASM 2 just looks amazing (don't like the first one...)
- villains: Maguire, by far. Vulture and Mysterio were great, but can't match Willem Dafoes Green Goblin. Doc Ock was cool too, while I think he wasn't as great as the comic book version (would like to see a more diabolic Doc Ock in the future). Garfield's villains were the worst in my eyes."
25379,Yeah seems pretty on point apart from the 7.
25380,"I really liked MJ in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, but Spider-Man 3 didn't do her a favor. While I - unlike most others - really, really love Spider-Man, especially exploring Peter's ""dark side"" and the conclusion of the Harry-arc, all the scenes and drama involving MJ was not great to watch. She acted like a bitch in this one. But especially in  Spider-Man 2 her relationship with Peter was great. And the Peter-MJ-Spidey-love triangle always gibes me some great Richard-Donner-Superman-vibes."
25381,"1. Tobey because he's truly the embodiment of the early Lee Ditko Parker. The guy who gets bullied before getting his powers. Would be great if we explored his Highschool years more but that's just a nitpick because he graduates after 28 Issues anyways.

2. Tom in Civil War because on how he was written bar the Stark BS (but overall it has to be Andrew rn.)

3. Tobey no question.

4. Andrew no question.

5. Tobey no question.

6. Andrew best actor of the 3 tbh.

7. Tobey had not only his true love but she was written extremely well in those 3 movies.

8. Tobey no question.

9. Andrew because the death of Gwen was executed so breathtakingly good, although the movie is still the worst Spider-Man movie of all time.

10. Tobey, I mean it's freaking Elfman!

11. Tom/Tobey. Tom, just because he's fits the role of a (28 issue Highschool) kid but Tobey is actually a more fitting role for an adult Peter."
25382,"Tobey and Andrew
Not that much people like Tom Holland even if they do they either are fan girls or just Spidey fans"
25383,I respect that.
25384,"1. Tobey
2. Andrew
3. Tom
4. Andrew, but specifically in TASM 1 for the first-person web swinging
5. Tom
6. Tom
7. Tom
8. Tie between Tom and Tobey
9. Tie between Tom (Homecoming, lifting the rubble) and Tobey (3, ripping off the symbiote)
10. Tie between Tom and Tobey (3 again, specifically with his interactions with the symbiote)
11. Tom"
25385,Spider-Man is obviously the best Spider-Man smh
24912,"Andrew had the potential to be the best. If he had a better script and didn't have a movie that was shit on by Sony, he could've been the best."
24913,Andrew was terrible
24914,"Peter Parker: Tobey Maguire

Spider-Man: Andrew Garfield"
24915,This seems like a weekly post and whats weirder is each poster thinks its an original question.
24916,"Nicholas Hammond portrayed the best grown-up Peter Parker, possibly because he portrayed the only grown-up Peter Parker.

And I’ve gotta say, whoever wore the Spider-Man costume on The Electric Company was a terrific physical actor."
24917,Tobey and Tom are the best and the Japanese live action Spider-Man
24918,"Tobey Maguire played a good Peter Parker. As an awkward socially inept nerd.  But as Spiderman he remained awkward and wooden. His quips came across as rehearsed (which they were of course) and stale. Compare this to Robert Downey Jr. whose (also rehearsed) quips seem spontaneous and give the sense that Tony Stark is quick witted. 

Andrew Garfield played Spiderman much better.  You feel his angst and his heart break over uncle Ben. Hee also had great chemistry with Emma Stone. As Spiderman he came across as witty and charismatic. But as Peter Parker he was too cool. He was more of a misunderstood loner than a nerd. Andrew Garfield is naturally charismatic anyways and would probably struggle to come across any other way, But the script here didn't ask him to. I actually thought ASM was good. ASM2 was a mess through no fault of Garfield. 

Tom Holland pulls off both aspects of Peter Parker/Spiderman. As Peter Parker he pulls off the classic socially inept genius on the outside of social circles looking in. He is overeager and a little girl crazy, much like classic comic book Parker. As Spiderman he's a hard luck hero who won't stay down, talks a mile a minute, ahs uses his brain as much as his brawn. I love the Queens accent he uses to disguise his voice. 

Andrew Garfield is the best actor to play Spiderman. Tom Holland plays the best Spiderman. Tobey Maguire was just ok but it was the first time we saw Spiderman on the big screen so we geeked out about it anyways."
24919,Yes perfect
24920,"Finally, someone I agree with!"
24921,"i love this comment, good analysis"
24923,Tobey by default. There are some secondary elements he could improve on but he’s the only one to get the core of the character right and that’s what matters most.
24924,"Tobey is the best in my mind due to nostalgia. 

You're being downvoted because others can't accept that there's a strong bias for Maguire's Spider-Man."
24925,"Oh, it’s not just nostalgia. It’s my honest unbiased opinion. He is objectively the most accurate so far. I’m not in the ridiculous “He’ll never be topped” group but he hasn’t been topped yet. I am very willing to embrace a better, more well-rounded Peter. He just hasn’t come along yet. Shame really. All they have to do is look to The Animated Series and Spectacular to get the character right."
24926,Disagree
24927,Yuri Lowenthal
25295,Tobey
24929,Andrew is the best actor but Tom Holland is the better Spider-Man.  And Tobey had the best movies
24930,Yea i def agree
24931,"I dont get all the Tom Holland hate on this sub. Andrew Garfield was shit as Peter Parker and a mediocre Spider-man. Tobey was fine for the time, bar Spider-man 3."
24932,"I don't like any of them. I know that's a little harsh but I don't think any of them really nailed it. Stated differently, I do not recognize the Peter Parker I know and love from the comics when I watch these guys on screen.

But of the three, I definitely enjoyed Tobey's movies the most. I don't really attribute that to him, though. Sam Raimi is the man."
24933,I totally agree with you when it comes to the comic Peter
24934,What about the PS4 game? Please tell me you liked him in that?
24935,"Never played it, so I couldn't say."
24936,Noooooooooooo!!!!!
24937,"I have a stack of unplayed Spidey games in my collection going back to the 2002 PS2 game, which is still in the plastic, come to think of it. One day I will get around to playing all of them. But I have to catch up on about five different Final Fantasy entries and every Halo game after Halo 2.

I missed about a decade of (video) gaming and am slowly getting back into it. I was still gaming during this time, mind you, but focusing on chess, Magic and poker. That's more info than you needed but yeah. I'll get around to the PS4 game. Eventually."
24938,"Take your time dude. Life is to be enjoyed, not rushed."
24939,Tobey but I feel like that's the nostalgia talking
24940,"Tom has been the best Peter by far IMO.

His Spidey needs a ton of work though. None of them have nailed Spidey though Garfield got the closest."
24941,I feel like the only reason Tom  really hasn't gotten to show his Spidey off properly is due to script  limitations. I think come the  time by the third movie there'll  probably be more focus on the wit.
24942,"I think the exact opposite. Tobey has the best Peter, jury's out on best Spidey for Garfield or Holland"
24943,Tobey by far.
24945,PS4 Peter Parker!
24946,"This conversation is never gonna end, but for what it's worth, Andrew is the best actor here."
24947,I just wish he was given more of a chance. His talent was wasted on Sony's desperate attempt to keep some rights...
24949,THANK YOU ive always been saying that but people like tobey more than both tom and andrew
24950,"Best movies- Tobey

Best Actor- Andrew"
24951,Tobey and Tom but not andrew
24952,"""Gasp."""
24953,"I’m gonna get so much hate for this but, Garfield."
24954,"Andrew gave a good performace, he was just in bad movies. He was a good Spider-Man in bad Spider-Man films. I think people fail to understand that."
24955,But tasm 1 was a good spiderman movie.
24956,"It was ok for me. Had some weird pacing, and they seemed to just forget about the plotlines about his parents and finding Ben's killer halfway through. Enjoyable, but far from perfect."
24957,"They didnt forget, Peter was just being responsible and focusing on stopping the lizard, The pacing honest to god was not bad, I thought the pacing would be bad on my 2nd rewatch but for some reason it built up good, If only the deleted scenes wernt taken out"
24958,"I think it was my expectations honestly. I've only seen the movie twice and upon my second watch, I just remember the first time being... Better."
24959,Tobey easily
24960,"Tobey was the best Peter. Andrew was the best Spidey. Tom isn’t better at what those two guys were good at, but he’s much better overall."
24961,I think you said it best!
24962,Tobey's Peter was awful. Peter has never been a whiney pushover in the comics.
24964,"Tom for the best  
Tobey second best  
And Andrew the worst"
24965,"Tom best Spidey, followed by Andrew.

Tobey best movies, but you know, Tom's had 1."
24967,"Tobey Maguire gave the performance the movies needed for that era. His earnest performance grounds the movie in emotional truth, and then that allowed Raimi to allow the environment and world around him to be cartoon/comic like while still having audience buy-in. It's like Mark Hamill in the first Star Wars, we needed earnestness to buy into the rest of the world.

&#x200B;

Andrew Garfield came across as smug and unlikeable to me. 

&#x200B;

Tom is solid, but I feel like the script for his solo outing held him back. He's not getting a chance to explore the pathos of Peter Parker, and that makes it feel like a fast food/diet brand version of Spidey. He's a very charming and likeable lead, though."
24968,"Best Peter Parker- toby
Best Spider-man- Andrew
Balance portrayal- Tom"
24969,"Tobey best movies

Andrew best performance"
24970,"Andrew is the best actor, Tobey has the best movies, and Tom is... Tom. He's just Tom. Not a lot of good stuff over there..."
