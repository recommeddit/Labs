7778,"Is $600 for ASUS Zenbook a good price?

Or should I get HP Envy x360 for $700? (15.6, Ryzen 4500U, 8 GB Ram, 256 SSD)

I missed the last Amazon deal for Lenovo Flex 5 for $600 and I am running out of time since my school starts on Jan 20th."
7779,"Hi, if you're referring to the one on my list with a Ryzen 5 4500U + MX350, it has been down to $550 before, but $600 is a still an awesome price for it. What do you plan on doing on your laptop?"
7780,"Mostly school but I do some light gaming. I am stuck between getting the zenbook or a 2-in-1 like the envy or flex because I don't know if I would actually use the 2-in-1. I always take notes on paper but I want to maybe see if I would like taking notes writing on the laptop, so unsure."
7781,"I see... it depends on how much gaming performance you want. If your expectations aren't very high, you might be fine with just the integrated graphics. So, aside from that, it comes down to whether or not you can make good use of the 2-in-1 feature."
7782,"Hi Sir, 

I was wondering if you could assist me with my quest for a new laptop, as I am a bit new to finding good Razyn/Intel laptops. It has to be a 2 in 1, somewhere around 13.3 to 15 inches, and the budget is between $1000- $1200 CAD (\~$800- $1000 USD). I am an engineering student and primarily use it for school. As a benchmark for power, I would need to be able to use it for the regular browsing/ working on Microsoft Office and a bit of python programming and also use Inventor 2021 (not ginormous assemblies, pretty modest beginner/ intermediate projects) I would like the most bang for my buck, I came across this HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 13-ay0021nr, I was drawn due to the high ram, however, I only saw it on the American Store, and I could not seem to find it in Canada. Do you happen to have any other recommendations? Any help would be appreciated, many thanks!"
7783,"Hi, you can find that [**HP Envy x360 13""**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/2020/06/21/envy-x360-13-ryzen74700u/) in Canada, here is the link. It is $1,399 CAD, though.  If you can go over budget, it would be worth it."
7784,"Hi, thank you for the reply I will be considering it, however, do you happen to know any other laptops in that range that you can recommend I look into? If not that’s fine, thanks again"
7785,"I think that the only other option to keep your eye on is the [**Lenovo Flex 5 14""**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/2020/05/24/can-flex-5-14-4500u/). It also has 16 GB RAM, but is very hard to find in stock."
7786,"Sorry once again, but one last thing: I have found the Flex 5 for $1000, but I have also found the Yoga C740 for around $1080. Almost everything is the same or significantly better (16gb ram, 300 nit screen on the C740 vs 250 nit on the Flex 5, better color accuracy on the C740, 1Tb hardrive on the C740 vs 256 on the Flex 5), however, the only thing is that the C740 has the ""10th Generation Intel Core™ i7-10510U Processor (1.80 GHz, up to 4.90 GHz with Turbo Boost, 4 Cores, 8 Threads, 8 MB Cache)"" which I noticed was a different brand than the Ryzen 5 on the Flex 5. Do you happen to know whether the computers come close enough in terms of performance?"
7787,"Can you link the Yoga C740 you're looking at for me?

The Flex 5 14"" is still significantly more powerful with its Ryzen 5 4500U."
7788,"Sure, it is the furthest to the left here (I have an additional discount). The pen is a non factor- I have my own anyway. https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/Lenovo-Yoga-C740-14/p/88YGC701292. The problem is the inferior display on the FLex 5, 250 nits seems peanuts on paper compared to others as well as the color accuracy. However, if it is THAT drastic of performance difference I will reevaluate."
7789,"Ah, that 's a really good deal for the price actually. Spending more for the HP Envy x360 13"" would be most ideal, but that's a great deal."
7790,"Hello, 

I'm slightly overwhelmed with the choices and different recommendations from friends, so I'm wondering if you can help me. 

- My budget is £500-£600 (So the $600-$799 range).
- SSD for sure
- 8GB ram ideally
- Decent battery life, maybe 4 hours (my current one is 0 so anything is a step up)
- For general use, streaming netflix, photoshop, also potentially video editing (would you recommend a higher budget for something like this?)

Thanks ever so much for any advice."
7791,"Hi, I would look at /r/laptopdealseurope for deals in your country.

I'd say that at this time, the [**ASUS Vivobook M413DA**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-VivoBook-X512DA-R5-3500-Windows/dp/B089Q2PWN8/&tag=laptopz18-21) is the best value choice. You get a 4-core Ryzen 5 3500U processor, 8 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" display. Otherwise, if you spend a bit more (that would be ideal for video editing), I'd go for the [**Huawei Matebook D 15**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HUAWEI-MateBook-Multi-Screen-Collaboration-Fingerprint/dp/B08HR3W84V/&tag=laptopz18-21) when it restocks."
7792,"Oh thank you, didn't realise that was a subreddit. And thanks for the recommendations, much appreciated."
7794,"Hi! Looking for the best school (casual) laptop around. School work, casual social media, 
youtube. Price is not a factor. 2 biggest things I'm looking for is durability and longevity. If I'm spending this much money, I would like it to last a long time or have a great warranty. I was looking into 2020 MacBook Pro, but I heard they can be a bit fragile and costly to repair.

Any thoughts? Thank you so much!!!"
7795,"Hi, it very much depends on how much you plan on spending. If you go with a MacBook, there's no point in getting the MacBook Pro unless you need the touch bar or longer battery life. Otherwise, I'd go with the MacBook Air. It is simple device that is generally user friendly. Their build quality is good, so I wouldn't call them fragile, but they are expensive to repair."
7796,"Roger that. Appreciate the info. Price point isn't really a concern. I'm looking anywhere from $750-2K+. I'm leaning towards the Pro? Because some people were complaining the air overheats. Would you suggest buying a year old model? I heard the older macs are more reliable, or atleast you don't have to worry about kinks. Beyond that I was looking into Dell & Lenovo 2 in 1's... pretty outside of my element though, confusing with all the options.

All I care about is schooling, and preferably note taking in class. I may buy mac air and an ipad pro combo (I heard the notetaking on the ipad can't be matched).

Any info is appreciated! Thanks for all the work you do putting this all together."
7797,"Where did you hear that the Air overheats? With the new Apple M1 chip, the MacBook Air can run at full tilt for over 8 minutes... you probably won't ever be pushing the laptop that hard anyways.

No, you definitely don't want to get an older Intel model. Compatibility with the Apple M1 chip is starting to improve, and a large handful of programs are already supported. If you're mainly doing browsing, there's really nothing to worry about."
7798,Thanks for the advice! I was just searching reddit reviews on here. A few people complaining about it and recommended the pro over air. Appreciate the info very much.
7799,"Anyone have an opinion on

Looking for a computer for programming, possibly CAM software. Not priority but be nice to have something like this for sheet music for piano. Had the Flex 5 twice and every time there was something wrong with it (broken speakers first, then overheating and stuttering on the second), hopefully qc is better with these."
7800,"Hi, if you're specifically looking for a 15.6"" 2-in-1, that's definitely a very solid choice for the price. The only other option I would recommend looking at is the [**HP Envy x360 15""**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7169&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ee000-8mf60av-1). I provided the link to make a custom configuration. Either one would be a great choice for your uses. The HP Envy x360 15"" comes with a Ryzen 4000 processor and can be configured with a 400 nit display."
7803,"Hi, any laptop recomendation for clg use with a budget of 800-1100$, 
light weight, 
long battery life,
Good ram(16 gb if possible) 
good processor (needed for coding), 
good display, 
2 in 1 if possible, 
and good enough to play games like valorant."
7804,"Hi, since you prefer a 2-in-1, I'd say go for the [**HP Envy x360 13""**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45-suggestalaptop&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13-ay0021nr). It happens to be on sale currently. You get a 8-core Ryzen 7 4700U, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS 300 nit display. It can definitely run Valorant. [Link to my benchmark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57u0tW_am9Q)"
7805,"Ty looks great, any model with a bigger screen??"
7806,"[There is the 15.6"" model](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7169&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ee000-8mf60av-1), which you can custom configuration for. However, it is out of stock currently."
7807,"Someone knows a good laptop for programming/general use around 900 euros in France with QWERTY keyboard? I don’t care about videocard, I’m looking for something with 8gb+ ram, 512gb ssd or plus, and 15,6” to 14”.
My last Dell G3 just broke and I’m kinda sad looking for another pc."
7808,"Hi, I'd look out for the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14"" or 15"" model, ideally with a Ryzen 4000 processor. Within your budget, you should be able to get the specs you're looking for."
7810,4th gen i5? 120gb ssds? What is this shit?
7811,"It is important to keep in mind that not everyone has enough money to afford a decent, new laptop. If you're fine with a used device, used ThinkPads are almost always the way to go. Although they aren't very powerful, they have great build quality. People who are doing general tasks don't typically need much power so an older 4th gen i5 can suffice.

As for my point on SSDs, this is recommended for anyone who buys a laptop with a hard drive. Most people will store the OS on the SSD, then put all other files onto the hard drive, which is why a large SSD isn't typically necessary. 

Almost all laptops these days come with SSDs, so that that point is becoming less applicable over time, but regardless, the point still stands that everyone should have SSDs in their laptop."
7812,Thanks 🙏

7815,"Hi, if you're doing simple edits, you should be fine with integrated graphics."
7816,"Hi, I am looking for a laptop under $600 just for general use, not gaming, would prefer 500GB+ storage (ssd/hdd) but not a must. Was looking at the vivobook and aspire 5 paired with a mid-range CPU like i5/ryzen 5 but not sure which is better, if any. Mainly looking for the most bang for the buck and good durability/quality, so I am open any recommendations. Preferably not Lenovo/chromebook though. Thanks."

7820,"I'm hoping someone here can help me? I'm trying to buy a laptop to replace my outdated chromebook and my struggling Dell laptop, I study programming but admittedly hardware is not my strong suit.

My biggest problem with my Dell is that it struggles with multitasking. When I'm working on projects I like having open web browser, software like VSC or Eclipse, Word, etc open concurrently. It lags to load things, and certain webpages will trigger it to stutter. I don't need anything fancy, just something powerful enough to run the above programs and be able to handle some multitasking without making the experience maddeningly sluggish. 

Everything else is sort of secondary, I just want a laptop that can keep up, preferably for under $500. Any advice?"

7832,don't use userbenchmark (for cpus) ... [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSBj2LKkWg)
7834,Gaming on Integrated graphics and coding
7835,"In that case, I'd say go for an 11th gen i5, specifically the i5-1135G7. It has stronger integrated graphics than the 4500U, and should still be plenty powerful for coding."

7842,"the price is 830$ ,i need it for casual and also student use and i just search for a laptop which is lightweight with good specs and durable"
7843,Should I get https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/reviews/B07X6MJ4X7/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1 or https://www.amazon.com/MSI-9SEXR-250-i7-9750H-RTX2060-Win10Home/dp/B0843HCPJX?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1 ?
7844,"The MAG-15, definitely. Much better cooling + better keyboard + better battery life."

7848,"Not really. Performance in games is going to be similar on both laptops, and that Y540 doesn't have a good battery life."
7849,Thought I’d be out of questions but is it worth paying $200 more for another 500 gigs of storage and 16 gigs more ram? Trying to get a laptop to last me at least 6 years

7851,What do you all think of the Microsoft laptops?

It has a 99Wh battery, so battery life should be great."
7857,That's amazing. Would you recommend it over the asus zephyrus g14?
7858,"Yes, unless you need a 14"" display. That's because Intel is generally still better for gaming, plus the Aorus 15G has a higher wattage GPU."
7859,Would you recommend the Lenovo yoga 9i or the HP spectre x360?
7860,"Hi, they are both generally decent devices, but I need more information. Does battery life or weight matter to you? Are you looking for a 2-in-1? What is your budget?"
7861,"I think I am leaning towards a 2-in-1 at this point but still very open to suggestion (I have also considered the XPS). Trying to keep it around 1500 US dollars but willing to go a little above that range if need be. I definitely value some portability, as I will probably be starting grad school in a year or so. I do care about battery life but it isn't necessarily my number one priority. Other than school, it will be a general use laptop."
7862,"Hi, as long as you don't mind a Windows device, I'd go with the [**Lenovo ThinkPad E15**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/oem-lenovo-thinkpad-e15-gen-2-15-6-fhd-display-1920x1080-intel-quad-core-i5-1135g7-16gb-ram-512gb-nvme-w10p-business-laptop/), a business grade laptop. It comes with a 4-core i5-1135G7 processor, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks, as well as light photo and video editing. Battery life is around 7-8 hours for light use and weight is around 4.3lbs."
7863,thanks! any pointers on why this Lenovo E15 instead of a macbook pro? just curious as i'm not too tech savvy.
7864,"Not the dude, but isn't MacBook Pro out of your price range?"
7865,"Since your needs are basic  and reliability is a concern you should go for the **[ Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2](https://www.rapiddeal.net/product/lenovo-thinkpad-e15-gen-2/)**  which is a well-built laptop that will be able to last for years. It has a powerful and future proof processor and a fair amount of RAM so it is able to multitask efficiently without lagging. Thinkpads are known for their reliable build quality so you won't have to worry about it falling apart after a bump or two. It has a long battery life so you can leave your charger at home when you take it on the road.

15.6"" FHD Display 1920x1080 IPS, AMD Ryzen 7 4700U, 16GB RAM, 512GB NVMe"
7866,"Highly suggest the [Apple M1](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-apple-macbook-m1) if you are looking at laptops.. it destroys every other computer in both thermal efficiency, battery, and speed."
7867,It still does not support *thunderbolt* so that sucks if you like gaming / gpu activities.
7868,"This is so helpful, thank you. Which in the cheaper range would be adequate for mostly school work, but also some occasional light gaming? Looking for a budget friendly laptop that can be toted around in a backpack and run an occasional Steam game (not worried about having the best graphics). Thank you!"
7869,"I'm not quite sure about what games you actually play. For non-demanding games like CS:GO or Rocket League, I'd say the 11th Gen i5-1135G7 Acer Swift 3 would be a pretty nice fit even though it's not in the list above. You might also want to look at some previous Gen laptops with 1050ti or MX350 graphics considering that they might have a pretty nice value right now.

&#x200B;

Maybe I should add that to the list."
7870,"Thank you so much! I will check those out. For games, I am hoping to play Tabletop Simulator a couple times a month (and probably the new Spyro games!), but otherwise I mostly need a laptop for coding in Python and general school work. I was looking at the Asus Zenbook 14 or Lenovo Flex 5 (both AMD Ryzen 5 4500U), but wasn’t sure how they compare or if you would recommend them."
7871,"You might want to get the 4700u (or 5700u, essentially a 4800u, fairly soon) variant if you value gaming less and are planning to code on virtual machines.

Ignoring the convertibility, I'd personally prefer Zenbook 14 over Lenovo Flex 5 for its portability, the larger battery, and its aesthetics."
7872,Great points. Could you provide me links or suggested sites for the Acer Swift 3 and the Asus Zenbook 14 with the recommended specs? Thank you!
7873,"I'd just go for official vendors on amazon or bestbuy if I were to get a laptop, they're usually at their best price over there."

If you have access to the Chinese market, the closest I can think of are the Redmibook 16, the Magicbook pro 2020, and Mechervo's Code01."

You may also consider Razer Blade Stealth 13 if your workflow requires more GPU performance and not CPU performance."
7882,"Hey ! A bit late, but what are the advantages of one of them compared to the other ? I'm struggling to choose a laptop that can edit and last long since I'll only have one computer"
7883,"The term ""last long"" would be kind of vague. A laptop would work just as well in five years if your workflow remains unchanged. The advantages of razer blade stealth and asus x13 flow are that they are equipped with dedicated graphics and have the potential to run more graphics consuming tasks. The general advantages for the M1 macs are their battery life, compatibilities with Apple devices, and, some would argue, the MacOS."
7884,"Looking for something 15.6 inches. Priority is screen quality and battery life, don’t need a dedicated GPU"
7885,LG gram 16 2021 is almost the perfect fit. Get the  LG gram 15 2020 if you really need it to be 15.6 inches.
7886,Thanks I’ll look into this! I’m open to anything between 15-16in
7887,"Would you advice against the 15"" hp spectre?"
7888,"Mainly for two reasons:

1. The much cheaper variant from the Envy lineup, say the Envy x360 15, is almost equivalent in all aspects.

2. 15-inch is just too big to be treated as a tablet.

Yet, 15-inch 2in1 is an extremely niche market. There are very few replacements out there."
7889,Great post. Which in the 900-1300 range would be best for college work and light photo editing?
7890,"Oops sorry, I might've overlooked the reply. I'd simply recommend the MacBook Air/Pro if you don't have any preference on the OS."
7891,"Hi! This is a great post thanks a lot! I am a consultant/data analyst and currently I do lots of tasks on excel. I wanted to buy MacBook M1 but it's not working well with excel so I checked other products on the market. I was mainly considering dell XPS 13 9310 but i see lots of complaints about the QC. Did you consider QC in your listings? 

Also what would be your all around recommendation for me? Getting an ultrabook like XPS 13 or HP or looking for something slim but not an ultrabook? This is a big dilemma for me right now.
Once again thanks a lot! Great work"
7892,"I've spent weeks looking for the right laptop. I'm trying to stay around a 2K Max budget. I'm looking at something rather high end, 14"" max. After spending quite some time looking into it, it seems I have to chose between a tablet/laptop with the last Intel CPU's, or a classic laptop with a Ryzen.   


Can't figure whether ""tablet"" laptop are really worth it. I want something I can use at work that can take a 50 chrome tabs opened at the same time, but also versatile and compact enough that I can use on from my couch to look up something quickly or take a few notes. I play a bit as well, but mostly indie/2d games on steam, and the occasional 3d game but nothing AAA.   


&#x200B;

I tried last year's XPS 14 but it was overheating. I have at the moment a Thinkpad Extreme Gen 2 and have the same problem. I tend to attribute that to the presence of dedicated GPU's but I might be wrong. Hence why i'm looking at the latest Intel CPU.   


I like the Yoga Slim 9i but something tells me it might not be the right choice.   


Do you guys have opinions on that one (the Yoga 9i)? Or recommndations? So far, here are the ones that made it into my list:   
Yoga Slim 9i  
LG Gram 14  
Huawei MateBook X Pro 2021"
7893,"Lg gram 14 and matebook X are very niched products aimed for extreme portability. I personally would have gone for LG gram 16/17 if I were to get one (it's literally a 13inch laptop but with a bigger display). Despite matebook X being a really nice looking laptop, out of those that you've mentioned, I think Yoga Slim 9i better suits your work style.  Other than that, maybe you might want to pay a little bit of premium for zenbook duo and or the new coming razer blade 14."
7894,"I've just seen this. In your case I'd pick a MacBook Air with M1 chip. The only limitation you might face is incompatibility with your games. You'd need to check if they are compatible with macOS and if they run under Rosetta2 in case they aren't translated to ARM. If not, they could also run on a Windows virtual machine under Parallels.

I don't suggest Huawei MateBook at all. I had a Huawei MateBook X Pro 2020, and I had to return it, because it was crazily overheating while charging it, even when it was turned off!

Now I own a MacBook Air and very happy with it. It always stays cool, has great built quality and battery lasts all day. It has a 13-inch display which has great quality."
7895,"anything interesting come out in Q2 or is this post still up to date? I'm looking for a lightweight laptop that I can take outside without having to worry about not being able to see the screen. I've found that the ones with a lower nit don't advertise the display brightness, so I would assume the ones that do are *decent* enough. I realistically just want to run VS/Code, and I prefer Windows so no M1 for me. I'm also trying to spend  < $1000"

7911,"If someone just needs a laptop for streaming, browsing, and light office work (word processing, etc), then you don’t (really) need a dedicated graphics card or even a monster processor. You’ll find a lot of deals on here targeted to those things (dedicated gpus and newest cpus). 

The more important factors would probably be how this person wants to use the laptop. 

Will they be hooking it up to external monitors/tvs? If so, need to look at the ports to make sure that lines up with what they need. 

Will they be traveling with it a lot? If so, they may care about how thin it is and how much it weighs. 

Using it on the go? Battery life is likely to be important.

It’s hard to say without knowing the answers to those questions, but in all honesty you likely want to look at some thin, mobile, computers made by Asus, acer, or gateway. I would recommend Asus of those brands, but you can find good deals all over the place."

7915,"Laptops under $500 are tough because performance varies pretty wildly and build quality is also all over the place. 

Here are few you could check out, but obviously sales could bring a better laptop under $500. 

[Acer Aspire 5 - $370 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Display-Graphics-Keyboard-A515-43-R19L/dp/B07RF1XD36/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=acer+aspire+5&qid=1613622138&sr=8-3)

Acer is known for having decent budget laptops. This is probably one of the better ones. It has a good battery and is fairly bright in the screen, but the build quality is suspect. 

[Gateway 15” - Walmart $400](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gateway-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Slim-Notebook-Intel-Core-i5-1035G1-16GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Tuned-THX-Audio-Webcam-HDMI-Fingerprint-Scanner-Cortana-Windows-10-Home-/225790553)

The gateway computers from Walmart are highly rated for being decent cheap options. This one is on sale, down from $700 to $400 and has a nice cpu for that price. The build quality is suspect and there are some quality control issues so you might get unlucky, but if I was going to get a sub-$500 laptop it might be this one. Plus it has cool colors, if your friend cares about that. 

[HP Pavilion 2 in 1 - BestBuy$500](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-pavilion-x360-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-natural-silver/6428667.p?skuId=6428667)

This one is if your friend also wants a tablet. I extremely dislike 2 in 1 laptops, because usually it doesn’t do either function well. But I threw it where for an option."
7916,Is it easy to somehow increase storage on the Gateway? I see it only has 256 gigs
7917,"Yes and no. 

There is an open m.2 slot for extra storage, which is nice, but there's no 2.5"" bay, which would offer the ability to add cheap gaming storage; a 2 TB HDD is well under $100, which is a fraction of what a 2 TB NVMe SSD would run you.

It will cost some money to get more storage in there, but it is easy enough to do with the open bay. 

I would also suggest upgrading the ram, which also has an open dual channel to pair with the 8GB already in it"

It has an 8-core Ryzen 7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and a 256 GB SSD. It should be great for your uses. If you want something more reliable / has better build quality, I'd go with the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 on my list."
8005,Thanks so much!
8007,"Sorry, but one more question. I don't really need touch screen or 2 in 1, I'm not sure if that is contributing to the price of that laptop.

My main use cases will be browsing with 5-10 tabs open in Chrome, editing spreadsheets, and work use. 

I'm not too concerned with battery life or weight, as I would like either a 15.6"" or even a 17"". I guess my main focus is screen size and power, assuming this can all be had for anywhere for $750-$1,250.

Would you still recommend the same one?"
8008,"Despite it being a 2-in-1 touchscreen device, it doesn't really charge a premium for that. It is one of the most powerful non-gaming 15.6"" laptops."
8009,"Thank you, I appreciate the clarification."

8012,Hey Legos45! I was wondering what the best gaming laptop is for around $1000-1100 (:
8013,Hi! [I'd look at my gaming laptop list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/hjaude/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_july_2020/) The Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX 2060 is the best value in this price range.
8014,"How would you say it compares to the acer predator helios 300? I noticed it has 512 gb ssd while acer nitro 5 only has 256 gb ssd. 
The price difference I see is $1,023 vs $1,199. Is it worth paying a little more?"
8015,"The Helios 300 has better cooling + a better screen, which I think is worthwhile for most people. The extra storage is helpful."
8016,Thank you so much! You’re the best
8018,"I also had a quick question! I currently have an msi leopard. It has a lot of blacklight bleed and lately I’ve been having to trouble shoot WiFi problems because the WiFi adapter has to constantly be reset. Does that mean it’s the WiFi adapter in the laptop and not the router? Sorry, you’re the only person I know I can reach out to."
8019,"I would test with another device to see if your router is working. Otherwise, you can replace the WiFi card. Nothing much can be done about backlight bleed, unfortunately."
8020,"Yeah, everyone else is still connected to the internet. But okay (: thank you so much! One more question! Is the GTX 2060 and GTX 2070 that different? And also you’re awesome!"
8021,"Yes, there is a decent performance gap between the two. But, the RTX 2060 is still plenty powerful for modern titles."

8023,My gaming laptop list will be updated for September.
8024,"Hey legos! I had one last question. What do you think about the asus zephryus g14 ? I get $150 off and it’s $1,299! Should I settle with that or are there better?"
8025,"Does battery life or weight matter to you? If they don't matter to you, the Zephyrus G14 is not your best option."
8026,It 50% matters to me. I would like portability but also be able to use the laptop without it being plugged in the entire time (:
8027,"Then for the price, the Zephyrus G14 is your best bet, but it does run very hot."
8028,Thank you! I was told it runs hot but I heard there’s a handful of ways to fix it on YouTube! I just got my hands on it!

8030,"Hey, looking for a laptop with 16gb ram and at least 512 gb memory and preferably an amd ryzen 7 cpu (as I've read that it is more efficient on battery and speed). Additionally, battery life and a solid keyboard are important as I program and use excel quite extensively. I should mention that I don't game. I currently have an Xps 15 passed on from a sibling and aside from its battery problems and blue screening I enjoy it. However I've heard Dell QC is not the best.

I've been considering the asus zephyrus G15 (and not the G14 because the G14 is sold out everywhere and not currently sold by Costco). As for the G15, I'm a little deterred on the build quality, being prone to finger prints, and also having heard complaints about the keyboard. Just wanted to hear another opinion b/f spending almost 2k on a laptop hahah"
8031,"Hi, are you looking for a gaming laptop or a general use laptop?"
8032,General use (mainly dealing with large databases with programming and excel).
8033,"Ah, I see. Then, I think that paying more for a gaming laptop the Zephyrus G15 is not a good choice for you.

It has a 6-core Ryzen 5 4500U, 16 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS touch 1,000 nit display. This model has the Sure View display, which is a privacy filter. That unfortunately limits viewing angles to an extent, but the display brightness is excellent."
8034,"Okay, I'm kinda limited to Costco lol and they don't seem to carry it. Thoughts on the HP envy x360 2in1 w/ amd ryzen 7 4700U, 1TB ssd, 8gb ram? The only issue seems to be the ram but it can be upgraded fortunately.

Also, have you heard of 2in1s being less durable? I never really  plan on using the 2in1 function so hopefully it doesn't cause any issues"

8050,"Interesting topic. I generally think of reliability as model-series specific and not brand-specific. Every brand has its hits and misses, especially when you look at how many units they produce to meet every price-point.

Surface devices have been anything but reliable in my experience. If you've ever had the displeasure of opening one, then I think you'd agree they're not very repairable either. Seems to have taken pages out of Apple's book in that you better hope they keep chugging along (and to be fair, many do) but its probably going in the bin if something breaks.

Apple has an advantage in that they make fewer devices, most/all of them high-end. This gives them more brownie points for reliability compared to other brands that are averaged across their entire range.

Samsung I agree with based on limited anecdotes. I myself have a Samsung... something-or-other laptop that's very old and just refuses to die.

Dell has had more QC issues than most lately. Not sure what's going on but they seem to do a lot of platform/part sharing across their line-up. Most in the Precision line have been immune so far (apart from the ones that share platform with the XPS).

Lenovo.... sticking to the business-ey laptops, the Thinkpads remain reliable choices, perhaps thanks to their IBM DNA. Legion gaming laptops are good, as are a few other lines. Lenovo's probably the best example of the best and worst being under the same brand-name. That said, they seem to have made significant inroads towards improving the weaker parts of their line-up; Ideapads and the like.

ASUS seems to be consistently *okay.* If Lenovo's graph plots models at opposite extremes, ASUS's cluster towards the center.

Acer sells probably the most balanced laptops out there. So balanced that they seem underwhelming or out-of-place as other manufacturer's spend a lot more attention on 'consumer-facing' parts of the laptop such as the display/other finishing kit. They do cut corners at the low end, but almost never in a way that compromises functionality.

HP's made some weird choices lately. Their stuff tends to remain operational but seems to have a lot more *physical*/build-related failures. They still make some good laptops but those are more exceptions than the rule these days.

Rebadges- if you've seen one, you've seen them all for the most part. Good laptop-shaped-objects if you see them as a cheap desktop-replacement.

Though I find myself agreeing with many of your observations, I think its clear that reliability has more variables than can be accurately assessed in any objective way. We're better off looking at each product on its own merit rather than the badge on the lid."
8051,"All good points. Reliability is always a gamble, and it's always different for everyone."
8052,"Thanks for starting the guide.  Very helpful.

One tricky item is that outside of Apple and Microsoft, there is tremendous variation in quality between various lines of computers and even model-to-model differences. With Apple and Microsoft, everything they make is of similar quality.  Sure, they have the occasional miss like the tiny-bit-too-short ribbon cables from base to screen in MacBook Pro 2016s or the dodgy wifi in Surface Pro 4, but generally speaking Apple and Surface are high quality.  Neither are particularly repairable though with Surface devices basically being more-or-less sealed entirely. 

But outside Apple and Microsoft, it is harder to pick a single brand and instantly know what to expect. For example, HP has laptops (from best to worst or most expensive to least expensive):

* Elite
* Spectre
* Envy
* Pavillion
* ""HP"" no sub-brand

With quality ranging significantly from the top lines to the bottom lines. An Elite Dragonfly is going to be built to a much higher standard than a Pavillion. Likewise, Lenovo offers the ThinkPad line which are all built like tanks and even the cheapest ThinkPads (also not that cheap) are pretty good. They also offer the Yoga line (not to be confused with the ThinkPad Yoga), and then a notch down the IdeaPads."
8053,"Those plain HP laptops, I've had two of those. Although the specs are pretty nice, they seen to die really fast."
8054,"From my experience with 4 different laptops of different price ranges: avoid Asus' laptops at all costs: in one of them the screen hinges broke after 3 or 4 years, and again after changing them; another had BSODs out of the box and some years later the battery exploded; another one died with no reasons after a year and another one has fan grinding problems since it was new and after replacing the fans the problem came back after a month or two."
8055,"Damn. For me, I had two HPs in a row, one got a broken HDD after a year, and the other one ended up with a corrupted BIOS and a faulty motherboard in not even 7 months."

8057,Opinion on HP Pavilion?

8059,"Haven't had one in a while but the last one I had lasted for maybe 3 years before the hinge broke and some of the keys and trackpad stopped working

Dental student 2 months from graduating here.  

Honestly there isnt much difference between the tooth pastes as the big companies would like you to believe.  I do recommend one with flouride though (don't buy into the anti-flouride hype people, facebook science is not science).  What is most important is the mechanical action that your brushing is doing to break up the bio film created by the bacteria on your teeth.  Good oral hygiene is achieved by **mechanical methods** not chemical methods as much.  
Now this doesn't mean you need to brush hard, quite the opposite, get a soft bristle brush, brush in little circles with a 45 degree angle with the brush on your gums and tooth for best results. 

Brush 2 times per day.  Have a routine, don't just brush like a wild man, go from quadrant to quadrant.

Floss once a day.

*Pro tip*!:  Hate flossing?  Takes up too much of your time before bed?  Simple, floss while you watch TV or when you are relaxing at any other time in the day.  That way it won't feel like such a chore."
8077,"The dental residents I see at the hospital I work at recommend electric toothbrushes, do you agree?"
8078,"Yes! Be careful not to increase the pressure you apply to your teeth and gums, though. The pulsating brush action actually increases the 'stokes-per-minute' which is a seemingly common concern on this website."
8079,"Also really valuable for those with poor motor control, ie parkinsons or arthritis"
8080,">...action actually increases the 'stokes-per-minute' which is a seemingly common concern on this website.

Ahhhh, I see what you did there."
8081,"Yeah, make sure to Oral-B careful."
8082,Another dental student here. There is no concrete evidence that electric toothbrushes are better. What's more important is how you brush.
