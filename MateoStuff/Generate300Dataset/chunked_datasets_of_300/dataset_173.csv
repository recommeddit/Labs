56909,"Malvern, preferably fresh from the hillside spring taps."
56910,Essentia is the shit.
56911,Ramlosa
56912,JustWater™
56913,"Outhouse Springs Water. (The water is for sale at Piggly Wigglys in the Charleston, S.C. area for a limited time. The Outhouse Springs website has a lot more info.)"
56914,"I buy osmosis water from Whole Foods. Pretty darn good. Not as good as the spring water near my families wv campsite. We would buy jugs of that stuff.

&#x200B;

Deer Park is the worst water I've ever tasted."
56915,Volvic
56916,Smart Water
56917,Seltzer water. Specifically Canada Dry. It’s my crack
56918,isnt that soda?
56919,Carbonated water
56920,Fiji is great evian is imo the worst.
56921,"Any generic seltzer water. Buy a 12 pack, shake it up and smash it. Sooo much fun."
56922,Isklar or Imsdal. Also water with a lot of calcium is wonderful provided it is clean.
56923,Kirkland water
56924,"Tipperary still in a glass bottle. 

I got a bottle of this at a pub in north Ireland and it was the most delicious water I’d ever tasted."
56925,Ice mountain and tap water.
56926,NYC tap
56927,"Fiji all the way.

Essentia a close second, slightly too high ph"
56928,Voss - no doubt about it.
57233,Fiji
56930,"Yeah, Fiji is one of my favorites."
56932,Have you tried Waiakea?
56933,I love the brand that flows from my kitchen fawcet. And when I'm finished.. the fawcet doesn't end up in the ocean like other brand carriers do.
56934,So Brita. And you should try recycling.
56935,I do. Pass it on.
56936,"Well, I personally like spring water. Not purified shit water. To each their own."
56937,"It’s an issue of more than just recycling. The energy used to recycle plastic is extremely high, as well as the general need for the recycled product being pretty low. Few companies use a decent percentage of recycled material in their own bottles, so each one you drink is only adding more potential waste and newly created plastics"
56938,It seems like a lot of the brands I drink use recycled plastic and are 100% recyclable bottles outside the cap and label. I have a filter that came with my house and it doesn't compare to something like Poland Spring.
56939,"Does it say that they “use 100% recycled “? Because Nestle, for instance, uses 5% and advertises that it’s made with recycled material."
56940,This Poland Spring bottle I have right now says 100%
56941,"Good for them! Some quick reading tells me most brands don’t use nearly that much, and most bottled water is treated ground water (aka tap water), so in terms of energy usage and potential waste, a bamboo or metal reusable bottle is still much more eco-friendly, IMO"
56942,Deer Park
56943,"I used to drink Deer Park growing up in the south, but I can't find any in Florida for some reason. Zephyrhills has this area on lock. Lol"
56944,I’m a big fan of VOSS. I like the water and I like the bottles they come in
56945,"They're all plastic now, right? I wasn't a fan of the glass. Lol"
56946,"I didn’t like the glass ones either, but they are all plastic now. I like the larger openings, but they wouldn’t be great while driving. Might have spills"
56947,Whatever floats your boat.
56948,Pun intended?
56949,It wasn't until after I posted it that I noticed the slight humor in it. 😉
56950,Poland Springs is the real answer.
56951,Lol. That's what I'm drinking right now. I don't see it often down here so I had to grab some.
56952,Whichever brand says “overachieving h2o” i bought a bottle of it once and it was the best water ive ever had but now i cant find any more
56953,Essentia?
56954,"Mountain spring water run through my backpacking filter and into my Nalgene bottle.

The worst part is coming back to ""civilization"" and having to drink the water and realize it leaves a film in your mouth."
56955,Ice Mountain. Hands down my favorite.
56957,"Lolll. It's expensive at most places, but you can find it for a pretty fair price at others."
56958,"Fiji has always been my favorite, albeit most expensive (of my favorites)"
56959,Fiji is reaaly good but its also really expensive
56960,It’s all about personal preference. I like smart water or Fiji. Voss only if I need an awesome glass bottle. Tap is pretty awesome too
56961,I thought people on this sub wouldnt like smartwater because its owned by coca cola
56962,"Like I said. Personal preference. Some people think arrowhead is the greatest thing ever, gives me a splitting headache. I mainly drink my city water, it’s not terrible. Reuse the smart water bottles until they are not worth cleaning any more."
56963,"I like Just Water and Voss. Just Water’s supply is harvested ethically, and the bottle is reusable and recyclable in some towns’ recycling programs. Voss’s bottle is reusable and washable if you buy the glass one, most plastic bottles are not good to reuse since they have a tendency to grow bacteria. It just depends on the type of plastic used whether or not you can reuse. Unsure if Voss ethically harvests their water or not."
56964,Kroger brand.
56965,Icelandic Glacier water
56966,"I just buy store brand, refill the bottle with tap water, recycle when it starts to get grody."
56967,"Ah yes, Naive spelled backwards."
56968,"For a long time I was a big fan of Sink. It has an easy-to-use spout and it's always right next to a glass, so I think that's my most commonly used brand. It also pairs really well with Ice. 

In terms of sheer refreshment I have to recommend Hose. I have fond memories of grabbing a quick drink after running outside all day, and while Sink isn't ever too far away, Hose just provides a full force of refreshing, thirst-quenching goodness. 

For my ""don't recommend"" list, I have to mention Toilet. Yes, the serving sizes are giant. Yes, you can easily share it with your friends. All those benefits are rendered useless when you learn how little the refillable containers get cleaned. I'd much rather keep going back to Sink or Hose than sitting at the Toilet for a while."
56969,Can confirm.  Am dog.
56970,Is it bad I thought they were real brands until the last paragraph?
56971,"If English isnt your second language, yes"
56972,Fond memories of someone sticking the hose in their mouth and then turning it on full blast and making it come out their nose.
56973,"If I'm gonna pay for bottled water I want it to be at least semi-interesting... I think my favorite is **Apollinaris**, the so-called ""Queen of Table Waters"" that has been bottled in Germany since 1852. It's lightly carbonated, has 25% of your daily recommended magnesium intake, and is very very slightly salty. Also the preferred water of Patrick Bateman, how's that for snob appeal?"
56974,">very very slightly salty

I am deeply perplexed as to how salty this is."
56975,"The best I can say is, if you hadn't had anything to eat or drink in an hour and were just thirsty, or you were eating a regular meal with slightly salty food, you wouldn't really taste any of the salt in Apollinaris. But if you had just got done eating a donut or an entire candy bar and wanted to wash it down with something, Apollinaris would taste salty then"
56976,Interesting I might need to track down some and give it a shot
56977,It's also great for removing troublesome blood stains
56978,Apollinaris is extremely excellent
56979,"I don't bother with bottled water, but you have made me want to get some of this."
56980,"Feel that subtle saltiness, the tasteful magnesium in it

Oh my god, it even has a water brand"
56981,"I feel like this could become a really good haiku, with a little editing"
56982,This thread makes me wanna go to a water tasting.
56983,I just know Arrowhead tastes like ass.
56984,"It was way better back in the 80s, but I think that original spring went dry and whatever they are using now sucks."
56985,"They're basically using Riverside and San Bernadino tap water, which is horrible."
56986,"Hell, I remember it being good in the early 2000's. It probably changed a little more than a decade ago. I also remember that their bottles became way thinner and flimsier."
56987,"This has been one of my favorite comment threads to look at. I am losing it over some of your guys' heated responses. 

But for me, Fiji all the way."
56988,More than half of the people who live in Fiji do not have access to safe drinking water
56989,They should buy Fiji water then.  Problem solved
56990,Surprises me that no one has though of this before.
56991,Not surprising. I studied abroad there and every couple of weeks we were told to boil then freeze our water before finally thawing it to drink. I spent most of my 6 months there sick.
56992,"I was in an airport lineup for Starbucks talking to my sister about water brands, and I just start saying, 

""I hate Fiji water, "" as the lady behind me reaches out to grab a bottle of it. Not the best timing. 


I think it's creepy though, it just tastes too soft. It just flutters down your throat and you don't feel refreshed at all, just sort of violated. I tried defending that point in the lineup, but I only kept making it worse. 


After that I just kept walking into people and standing in everyone's ways by accident. It was a small scale disaster."
56993,YOU WANT TO SEE HEATED I'LL SHOW YOU HEATED. MOTHERFUCKER! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
56994,Looks like someone dropped their mixtape.
56995,just call me H. Clinton. Giving everyone what they want to hear.
56996,Fiji is the only water I've paid for that I felt was worth it. It also has the best shape for putting in an airplane seat holder.
56997,i just drink for the assdeadicks
56998,IT'S YOUR MOVE
56999,I quite like Tap™ Water.
57000,Oh look at Mr. Fancy Moneybags over here with his lead-free plumbing!
57001,I bet you had to pay extra for all those Nitrates.
57002,"Found the Flint, Michigan resident"
57003,"Funny, no such things."
57004,Peasant.
57005,"Hey, my country has some of the cleanest tap water in the world, so I don't even need to buy any kind of water."
57006,"I live in a city that has some of the cleanest tap water in the US, most bottled water brands taste worse"
57007,You want a boppin' in the gabba?
57008,My town's tap water is better tasting than any brand of bottled water I've come accross
57010,I've just recently acquired the taste for tap water. I used to be a Aquafina or Evian kind of girl.
57011,Welcome to the high life!
57012,"You only supposed to use that for tapping holes, you know."
57013,Brita filtered water
57014,"Zero Water for me, but filtered water is indeed tight"
57015,"The downvotes are likely because Pur (though going downhill) is a better (and safer) filter. Also, I prefer the taste.

I did not give you a downvote, just for reference!"
57016,"I don't know why you're getting downvotes. I exclusively drink Brita water at home, and whenever I can from my wife's Brita bottle."
57017,"LaCroix! Tastes good unflavored, sparkling, easy to drink."
57018,Fuck yeah! Drinking Remy's juices keeps me so hydrated
57019,Its a shame theres only 1 source
57020,Serious question. How do you pronounce that?
57021,Like the pornstar
57022,"""Luh croy"" french for the cross."
57023,"Luh-kwah, you heretic.  I DONT CARE IF THE FRENCH SAY SO..."
57025,Naive
57026,You're just mad because your parents named you after a bottle of water!
57027,"Heh, I just watched that movie two nights ago.  2 thumbs up!"
57028,"lol nice man, its a funny movie. ty"
57029,"Oh thanks, I hadn't yet had my mind blown today"
57030,"That's all I can see when I read that label -.-"""
57031,Smart water all day!
57032,It tastes like what I imagine water particles in clouds might taste like.
57033,"I get Smart water only for the bottle. It's sturdy, has a really simple design (both with shape and graphics), and it has the best nipple. I'll get one and just reuse it for a few weeks until it starts to wear down. It's perfect."
57034,Agreed. The bottle is the best part!
57035,I'm with you there.
57036,I only drink water that is harvested from glaciers by an inuit shaman.
57037,"If I'm being 2016, I would never fuck with Aquafina. That is like the coke of bottled water. 

Poland spring is a normal go-to. Doesn't everyone like poland spring?"
57038,Aquafina is a PepsiCo product.
57039,I did know this- it explains everything
57040,Dasani is coke's water
57041,"> That is like the coke of bottled water

Wait, coke in this sense like cocaine?"
57042,"Poland Spring all the way. That, or Shoprite brand, surprisingly."
57043,"If it's ""spring water"" it likely was bottled from the same sources. Crystal Geyser is also from the same sources as Poland spring I believe."
57044,"Nah, I just looked on the bottles, unless they're very long source springs, they're not the same. Poland Spring lists the names of springs in Maine, ShopRite doesn't list specific names, but lists certain areas in Pennsylvania."
57045,Ahh up in Mass a lot of the generics are bottled out of ME springs
57046,Makes sense
57047,"Oh man, Poland spring is the shit. Used to be skeptical when I first moved to New England. Now I am a believer."
57048,Honestly better than Dasani
57049,"Agreed, Aquafina is actually purified while Dasani is ""remineralized"" of all things"
57050,I'm surprised no one has mentioned that Poland Spring is owned in part by Nestle.
57051,Aquafina is almost distilled water. Pepsi makes Aquafina and they have a very rigorous purification process. There is basically nothing left except water. That is why it tastes like nothing.
57052,"This is correct. I used to design and build Pepsi plants, and the water treatment used is without a doubt the most extensive in the world. That said, it is as close to distilled water as you can get, and extremely tasteless. ""Contaminants"" are what make water (and vodka) taste better. 

BTW, I only drink tap water."
57053,I work for a company that services the ozone systems in most Pepsi and Coke plants. It's called Novazone.
57054,"As you well know, ozonation is one of only four disinfection steps in Pepsi's water treatment: hyperchlorination, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet light, and finally ozonation. The little buggies don't have much of a chance.  BTW, Pepsi has used several different ozonation technologies worldwide."
57055,"Poland spring *water* is okay. Their bottles are the worst I've ever experienced though (very thin plastic that gets crushed easily and generally makes a lot of extraneous noise, which I find quite annoying)..."
57056,I've only heard of it. Never tried it.
57057,Technically Dasani is the Coke of bottled water...
57058,I mostly drink Aquafina just because I can get the 24 packs of bottles
57059,Icelandic tap water.
57060,now we're talking on a whole other level
57061,"I can tell you that Zephyrhills is my **LEAST** favorite brand of water. 

I don't know if they have it outside of Florida, but it's basically just swamp water. It tastes like an alligator rolled around in it just before they bottled it. 

And everyone thinks I'm crazy for that opinion."
57062,Anything but dasani. It taste like dirt.
57063,"I recently found out Dasani has a high sodium content so that's probably where the flavor comes from. Having said that, Dasani is my top choice!"
57064,I cant stand Dasani. It tastes like pool water
57065,"Opposite for me, it's my favorite besides Smart Water. I like distilled water too.

I think I just really dislike chlorine-flavor, which I why I often don't like tap water."
57066,"Doesn't taste good agreed. But very easy to swallow,  right?"
57067,I am quite partial to any water with a chemical composition of H2O
57068,Just stay far away from that dihydrogen monoxide. Shit'll kill ya in high doses..
57069,Some people shower in that shit.
57070,How barbaric
57071,I was going to make a H2O2 joke but it doesn't work when written down
57072,"It's neat because you probably won't find a human-metabolism-satisfying volume of water that is entirely H2O.

Before you 'Duh' on me, it is usual for H3O+ and OH- to also be present in the solution. Soooo... I don't know if I've ever drank a portion of water that was entirely H2O.

[""In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it has a neutral pH of 7 \(at 25 °C\). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium)

Neat!"
57073,I like Nestle because I know supporting them will create legions of angry keyboard warriors.
57074,I don't care about anything else but Nestle seriously tastes like shit
57075,So you like your water salty
57076,Kirkland Signature (Costco) tastes the best for me.
57078,Why don't you just refill the bottles with tap or cheaper water
57079,"Silence, peasant!"
57080,"I always have Pellegrino within reach, I buy it by the case (glass bottles only)."
57083,"Absolutely, I have so many bottles I was at one point considering buying a glass cutter so I could make drinkware out of them."
57084,"I don't buy any brand. There's a retailer in my town that sells alkaline water, pH varies between 8 and 9. I get 5 gallons for $7, lasts me about a week"
57085,That used to be my program. So worth it. So delicious. Best water in the world is alkaline.
57086,As long as it's not Dasani I don care.
57087,"All these people talking shit on bottled water, ""why don't you just use tap water lolol"" have clearly never lived in an area where the local tap will give you some wicked runs if you drink it. Or in Flint, Michigan."
57088,Fiji. Because it tastes better than any other water. It has a soft mouth feel.
57089,"I just had this conversation the other day. I was telling a buddy that Fiji is my favorite because it just tastes..... Fresh. That's the only way I knew how to describe it. Then I realized you aren't paying for a brand, you're paying for how much you can or can't taste water"
57090,"Also, you know, it is imported from Fiji."
57091,It drives me crazy. I don't want to drink velvet.
57092,Yes. Very soft. Agreed there.
57093,My city's water is so soft that they had to put in extra minerals to make it harder
57094,"If I have to buy bottled water, I buy Fiji, because it is the most delicious. I try to avoid it because of the environment and all, but if I'm on a road trip or something and need something from a gas station, it's definitely going to be Fiji."
57095,The bottle is pretty sweet too.
57096,Fiji tastes like shale
57097,Topo Chico Agua Mineral
57098,"So refreshing with some lime! I actually don't like the lime flavored one though, it tastes off."
57099,Same. Usually lime flavored sparkling water is over powering with lime flavor
57100,"Deer Park, because the bottles are the fucking best."
57101,why is this not higher???
57102,"Evian, because they're cleverly honest at how naivE you are if you pay them for their product."
57103,"TAap. The A is silent of course. The water is derived from local sources, purified in mass quantities, and poured through only the finest stainless steel or enamel pipes. Marvelous..."
57104,Real water snobs use a Berkey.
57105,had to scroll way too far down for this
57106,"Screw brands, I installed an RO filter in my kitchen. The water that comes out of that bitch is downright amazing."
57107,RO filter?
57108,"Reverse osmosis. It's a 5-stage filter system with a reverse-osmosis membrane in there to get just about anything that isn't pure H2O out of the mix. 

The whole system is about 200 bucks to install. The carbon block and poly filters are cheap, they cost 30 bucks or so every 6 months. The membrane costs 70 bucks and lasts about 3 years for a normal family using it just for drinking water, so long as you remember to replace the carbon and poly filters regularly."
57109,"My parents got one of these and I almost prefer their ""tap"" water to bottles now,  the tap before the filter was absolute shit."
57110,I love Fiji
57111,Fiji just tastes the best
57112,I never thought a question about water could make me so angry
57113,"I live near a sketchy area to drink from the tap. Virtually everyone in my larger city buys bottled water. I used to live in the Midwest, however. On a farm. And we had our own well. Trust me, if I could safely drink from the tap, I would."
57114,Flint?
57115,Sorry... First world problems...
57120,Scottish tap water
57117,Gerolsteiner medium
57118,That shit tastes oily somehow. To me anyway.
57119,"Do they still sponsor a pro cycling team?

Edit: NOPE as of 2008"
57121,"Scottish Tap water. So crisp, so fresh. :)"
57122,not in chapellhall
57123,"Fiji! They don't have that ""minerals added for taste"" bullshit. I don't want my water to taste like minerals, damn it!"
57124,You should probably look at the mineral content analysis on the label then. You may be in for a shock...
57125,"Hey, as long as the taste isn't there, I'm cool with it."
57126,"The mineral content is literally what makes Fiji water taste (and feel) the way it does. 

Fiji water has such a high mineral content that it wouldn't be allowed as tap water in some jurisdictions."
57127,My favourite.
57128,"VOSS.  It has a better taste to it, and is not acidic like many other brands of bottled water.  Fiji is also good when I can't find VOSS.  When I'm at home I just drink tap water that has been filtered."
57129,"Thank you, my favorite as well. I also like that Voss comes in glass bottles so no plastic aftertaste. I really notice a better taste than Fiji."
57130,"This is an interesting topic and maybe it needed a [Serious] tag.

After living in the Midwest and having access to magnificent tasting tap water, I moved to SoCal, where the tap water tastes like it came out of the brow of a greasy teenager. I have to buy water so it's something I've spent plenty of time thinking about.

Flat water, I'm partial to Mexican Bonafont. It's leaps and bounds tastier than anything else I've ever tasted. In the U.S., I've found it at several Mexican grocers and the price isn't outrageous. I like Fiji and the Costco brand a lot too. I loathe Evian, Arrowhead and Crystal Geyser.

Sparking, Vichy Catalán is the perfect balance of everything you would want in a bottle of water."
57131,I'm all about Heavy Bubbles. Don't buy other stuff.
57132,"Tap water with 6 stage reverse osmosis filter. If I must choose a brand, I once drank a bottle labeled Pond Water."
57232,Tap
57134,The water at authentic Mexican Restaurants
57135,[caption](http://imgur.com/jICqH7W.jpg)I have a bottle of Jack Daniels spring water that is pretty good.
57136,My hero!! This guy is the guy of the night! (or girl)
57137,Fiji is my favourite. Second favourite is President's Choice. My sisters said they saw no difference in bottled water so I made them do a taste test with 3 different kinds of water plus mine. Everyone agreed mine was the best. Then they were tucked at me for making them hate their waters. Lol
57138,Tap water around the Chicago area only
57139,The water at my house. I live in Alaska so I literally have pure glacial spring water running from my tap. Pretty great filtration system too.
57140,Fiji Water.
57141,"Fiji, Evian or smartwater. Voss just tastes like bathroom tapwater to me."
57142,"Diet water, regular water is for the unhealthy. *takes bite of gluten free kale chip*"
57143,Crystal Geyser all the way. It doesn't have weird tastes like dasani or aquafina. The only thing that matches it is the water from the filter water dispensers around my university.
57144,"Tap, because its the same as bottled without the plastic and comes from the same place, plus its more regulated thus safer than bottled water."
57145,"Depends on your municipality. If you lived in Flint you wouldn't be saying that.

But it personally angers me a great deal that tap water standards are so poor in many parts of the country. Safe drinking water should be an absolute guarantee in a country this wealthy. Resorting to bottled water is absurd."
57146,"I live in Michigan, and the tap water in my town is amazing. I live pretty far north of Flint though, so that may be why."
57147,"Ice Mountain. Any spring water brand is amazing but Ice Mountain is just..refreshing.

P.S. Dasani sucks ass. It tastes like the bottle."
57148,"I like the water boiled at home best. But if I have to choose one brand, it would be Evian for their pretty light blue packaging colour. I'm a sucker for pretty packaging. And hey it can be used as a water bottle for awhile after I have finished drinking the mineral water inside."
57149,"Not necessarily a brand of water, but a brand of filter system - **Berkey**"
57150,"Culligan, because what size bottles do you get with aquafina or fiji?  1L?  And what does that cost you?  $2.50?  Rediculous!
    
I go with Culligan, 18.5L bottles for $5 or less."
57151,"Glaceau SmartWater with added electrolytes for advanced hydration.

^Yes^it^isn't^true"
57152,"Apparently they don't make it anymore, but I love Metromint's Chocolate Mint water."

57155,"The answer depends on your definition of “quality.” There’s different types of bottled water (spring water, mineral water, water from aquifers, etc), and each tends to have a slightly different taste, at least to some people. This is due to the various minerals found in these broad varieties of water. There’s also certain brands that claim their water is ultra pure, or is extra filtered, whatever. Those all more or less taste like nothing, which is probably what a lot of people want from water. 

In terms of whether it really matters which one you drink, no not really. Even the waters with the highest levels of minerals don’t really have enough to make a significant health impact. As for tap water, that very much depends on where you live. Most water treatment plants here in the U.S add fluoride to the water to help with dental health, so that’s one reason to opt for tap water here. 

Ultimately it’s up to you and how much you value minerals/purity vs. cost and potential environmental damage due to the plastics involved in large scale production."

57157,"My understanding is that no water is ""pure"" except distilled water, and I imagine that to taste a little flat.  All other water (tap water, mineral water, natural spring, etc) has trace amounts of minerals and ions.  This affects pH, hardness, and taste.  

On a side note, hard water is annoying, but overly soft water is too.  You'll recognize it when you shower and it feels like you can't rinse the soap off."
57158,"Distilled water tastes terrible, actually. I expected it to taste like ""nothing"" before I tried it, but I was surprised and it was legit bad."
57159,"Yep, many Reverse Osmosis water filters have a stage after the filtering where they add minerals back in to make it taste better."
57160,"Also because if you drink RO or DI water there's such little other stuff in it that when it goes into your body your cells will equilibrate with it and ions will move out of your cells into the water. So it can be unhealthy for you.

Edit: this is probably an old wives tale I'd heard."
57161,Your username sounds tasty. That’s all.
57162,This is untrue.  Your digestive tract is filled to the brim with ions from the food you eat.  Your body doesn't act like a collection of billions of ideal cells all in petri dishes.
57163,"Yeah, maybe it's just old wives tale I hear everytime I work with DI water.  I guess it sounds true but probably isn't. Maybe you don't want to drink litres of DI everyday but maybe it's ok. ... So nevermind"
57164,I actually like the taste once in a while.
57165,"I think to be completely pure you gotta get water that’s “deionized”, at least that’s my understanding of it.

Distilling may be exactly how that’s done, but iirc they are two distinct processes, with distilling being less thorough of a purification. I’m terribly sorry but I’m far too lazy to find evidence for this currently, so drink it with a grain of salt..."
57166,"Distilling and deionizing are different things.  Both of them result in more pure water than you start with, but in different ways.  Generally, distilling has a hard time removing certain compounds that happen to have about the same boiling point as water, deionizing will have trouble with non-dissolved matter, such as sediment, bacteria or other organic matter.  Of course you can also add regular filtration to remove some of that as well."
57167,The most real thing I've heard was when a Swiss rep of a university came to visit my highschool a few years ago was that he was shocked by how expensive Evian was here when in Switzerland the price is the same as the local water here.
57168,Yeah it's basically just normal water there.
57169,In France it's the most common brand. Is it that expensive in the US?
57170,"It's marketed as a fancy luxury brand here. It's one of the earlier bottled water brands here from before people commonly drank bottled water in the US, so it kind of developed a stereotype of bring something upper class people drank. Bottled water was for country clubs and spas, not normal people. Plus it used to come in fancy glass bottles. 

Now it comes in normal plastic bottles but is still more expensive than domestic brands. At a gas station a regular bottle Evian might be $2, whereas you can get a bigger bottle of a domestic brand for $1. I'd say it still has some connotations of being an upper class beverage and someone might gently tease you if it was the only thing you drank or your preferred brand."
57171,Evian is naive backwards.
57172,Yep that's the old joke. It's not why the company is named that but it's a funny coincidence.
57173,"I’m honestly not sure how much water hardness alters pH level. I believe water hardness is usually an indicator of how many minerals, metals, etc. remain the water by the time it reaches your home. Like you, around here it’s super regional and varies from town to town. Not sure if harder waters taste differently (I’d assume they do, just like mineral waters), but at least from my experience people tend to talk about water hardness as a consequence of owning a home/renting a place where you live, since it can calcify faucets and shower heads and whatnot."
57174,"The pH likely would only change in a very small way if at all. Especially with bottled water. You probably wouldn't even have a test that's sensitive enough unless you work for a college with an expensive chemistry lab. 


The pH only starts to change dramatically when it's something like sea or polluted water, which has a lot of stuff mixed in. (Like I'd you scooped out water from the toilet, you'd likely have either human waste or bathroom cleaner mixed in, which would affect the pH)."
57175,">Oh I see. What I meant by bottled waters was mostly spring and mineral waters as those are ones I’m familiar with.

Generally the include the actual source in small print on the back of the bottle. Even ones with 'spring' in the name often are just bottled from municipal water sources, so it's basically what you'd get turning on the tap if you lived in that city. Some of them use municipal water sources and then filter them further. Other's own their own wells or aquifers and either use the water as is or filter it further from there. 

> What are aquifers?

Basically underground lakes, like a big cave full of water. It might not be exactly a cave, but a lot of gaps between rocks but that's the basic idea. Fiji water comes from an aquifer, specifically an artesian aquifer. Artesian means the water is under pressure underground between rock layers instead of being part of the water table. Fiji claims they don't touch the water and just put in the bottles, so it's full of minerals which some people enjoy the taste of. 

>That’s interesting. So if pH is different throughout certain brands can that be an indication as to whether a water is purer or lesser? In the UK there’s certain regions that have hard-medium-soft water but I don’t know the entire basis of what that means.. Apparently hard water isn’t as good compared to soft for some reason.

I think you're not getting great answers to your question because you aren't being clear if you're asking about whether or not the water is healthier or if it's purer. Pure water would be water that doesn't have anything in it besides just hydrogen and oxygen. Most water isn't pure unless it's distilled or filtered using reverse osmosis, which most people don't like the taste of as they are used to their water having some flavor due to minerals like calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Some bottled brands like Dasani start with normal city water, use reverse osmosis to get pure water and then add minerals back to it to get a flavor that is consistent. 

Dasani didn't catch on in the UK because when they originally released it, it had too much bromate which was inadvertently added while they were adding the other minerals. It basically had a public relations flop afterwards and never caught on. 

Regarding pH, 7 is the value where things switch from being basic to acidic. With pH < 7 being acidic and with pH > 7 being basic. Drinking water is generally around 6.5-8.5 from what I've seen. So as long as it's in that general range, pH isn't really a concern. For reference, Diet Coke has a pH of 3.28, slightly less acidic than vinegar which is generally in the 2-3 range. Bleach is at the other end around 11. 

Hard vs Soft generally isn't a health concern. Hard water just contains more minerals which often make the water cloudy or cause appliances like water heaters to wear out more often. Obviously if the mineral making it hard is lead or arsenic that's an issue, but just hard or soft doesn't tell you much."
57176,"Ohhh okay. I think I understand a bit better now. Yeah the way I was asking must’ve sounded very incoherent, my bad. I don’t really know how to properly ask questions without sounding like I’m listing things. 

If minerals are used as some sort of flavour for water, are they not that beneficial for health in comparison to pure, filtered water? I always assumed that the amount of minerals that were in water meant that it’s more healthy."
57177,">I always assumed that the amount of minerals that were in water meant that it’s more healthy.

Again, it depends on the specific minerals. Some are neutral or even bad for you. Generally you get minerals from food too, so it's not like you need high levels of them in your water. You might have an issue if you only ever drank pure water though, I'm not sure what percentage water contributes to your normal mineral allowance, but I assume its pretty minimal."
57178,"It is worth noting that bottled water is colossally expensive compared to tap water. A $2 bottle of water costs the manufacturer about $0.05 to make.  A 4000% markup. Not to mention the plastic waste it makes.

If you have bad pipes you can buy a filter for home for your drinking water from the tap."
57179,"> A $2 bottle of water costs the manufacturer about $0.05 to make.

If you just buy 'normal' bottled water by the case at the grocery store, you're only paying like $0.12/bottle, often less. The small price is worth the convenience for a lot of people and certainly healthier than drinking a bottle of soda. 

>Not to mention the plastic waste it makes.

I'm not a fan of that, but I also recycle so I'm personally not too bothered."
57180,"Plastic recycling is a poor alternative to not generating waste, though. Recycled plastic is mostly downcycled, pollutes anyway, and is often just thrown away if nothing can be done with it.

 I mean I do it too, and am not happy about it. But better not to kid ourselves."
57181,"yeah, I don't think it's a perfect situation, but I'm not too bothered by the fact that I take a recyclable bottle with me sometimes when I'm out and about instead of remembering to fill my nalgene."
57182,"Tap water costs around [$0.005/gallon.](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/about/live-healthy/tap-water-vs-bottled-water)

Most bottled water is 16 fl oz.  which is eight bottles for one gallon. That makes it $0.96/gallon at your price assuming each bottle is 16 oz (which is remarkably cheap for bottled water).  

So, you can get 192 gallons of water from your tap for the same price you buy a gallon at the store.  Tap water is a LOT less expensive. (If you filter your water at home the tap water will cost more but still be substantially cheaper)

Also, aside from the plastic pollution remember bottled water may be taken from places that will miss that water."
57183,"I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Everyone knows that water itself is basically free. People pay for the convenience of having a bottle. If the bottle costs them 5 cents and they sell it to me for 12 cents, that's not a massively bad deal. 

If you want to convince people to stop drinking bottled water, lying about it being a bad deal economically isn't the way to do it. 

>bottled water may be taken from places that will miss that water.

So does tap water in some places. That might be a justification to avoid one specific brand, although I can't think of any that bottle water in places where water is scarce, but it's not a reason to avoid bottled water itself."
57184,"> lying about it being a bad deal economically isn't the way to do it.

Where was I lying?  Even your inexpensive bottled water is massively more expensive than your tap water.  It's easy math.

>Fiji Water leaves a large negative environmental footprint, as well as negative economic consequences for the people of Fiji.

>In 1995, Fiji Water built a facility to extract the water from underground springs that was entirely run on diesel. In 2008, the Fijian government wanted to raise taxes on Fiji Water, which until that point had enjoyed tax-exempt status, and in response, Fiji Water laid off workers. In 2010, the Fijian government tried to raise taxes again, and Fiji shut down its plant for a short period of time. 

>Fiji Water works in Fiji to produce this beautifully packaged bottled water shipped all over the world. Meanwhile, 12 percent of Fiji residents do not have access to clean, safe drinking water, according to the Water Authority of Fiji (via Xinhuanet). While Fiji Water has access to underground springs, the Fijian people have to deal with rusty pipes and an only sometimes functional water system.

>Nestlé has never been a controversy-free corporate neighbor. Critics charge that Nestlé is unjustly exploiting a public resource, but Michigan law permits any private property owner to withdraw from the aquifer directly below for free, given they pay a nominal $200 paperwork fee each year. In the context of Detroit’s ongoing water shutoffs to poor residents and Flint’s continued billing for lead-poisoned water, Nestlé’s bargain deal has predictably sparked outrage across the state.

>But Nestlé isn’t alone. Industries, utilities, and farms all withdraw hundreds of billions of gallons each year from Michigan groundwater sources. Pfizer’s pharmaceutical manufacturing operation near Kalamazoo alone draws around 6.9 billion gallons annually. The difference? Pfizer returns over 97% of that water, unpolluted, to the ground. Nestlé ships most of its 1.7 billion bottles out of state and many of them outside the Great Lakes basin.

57185,">Where was I lying? Even your inexpensive bottled water is massively more expensive than your tap water. It's easy math.

Because I'm paying for the bottle, not the water. Making something for 5 cents and selling it for 12 cents is normal markup, the cost of the water doesn't even affect it.

And yeah, some gas stations might sell the same bottle for $1 or more but they have the overhead of running a store along the side of the road and can charge more for convenience than the grocery store can. It's the same reason they can sell a hotdog for $2 when an individual one costs about 10 cents for 5 cents worth of meat. 

It's a shame that Fiji and Flint both have shitty governments that won't fix their water pipes, but that's basically irrelevant for a discussion regarding bottled water. Neither place is running out of clean water, they just have decided not to pump it to their residents. The residents should rise up and do something about it, I know I would."
57186,You can buy reusable water bottles.

They have risen up (unless you mean grab some guns and overthrow the government).  It doesn't work. Look at the months and months of protests around the country just to get cops to stop choking people to death...so far that has not produced results.

Perhaps they will but what you ask is no small or simple thing.  History is littered with people trying this.  Sometimes they succeed.  Always at great cost."
57189,"Pure water is always pH 7. The farther away you get from 7, the less pure it is. But water being less pure doesn't make it worse. I mean orange juice isn't pure water but people like it.

Hard vs. soft water refers to the amount of dissolved minerals in the water, which are present as ions. The more ions, the harder the water is. Hard water leaves hard water deposits, so IMO it is not desirable for cooking of cleaning. Soft water leaves a soapy feeling on your hands when you wash your hands. Very hard water may have a noticeable taste and water hardness in general can affect suitability for use in aquariums. In general hard water has a higher chance of leaving gross deposits for example in showers, on faucets, or in your water heater, but other than that there isn't much to say about it.

In most parts of most first world countries, if the government said the tap water is OK to drink, it's probably OK to drink. Some water might be slightly better for you or worse for you but there really just isn't enough research about this. You may feel uncomfortable drinking certain types of water with higher levels of contaminants or you may simply not like the taste of your tap water; if that's the case, you can consider a home reverse osmosis system. In multiple stages, it removes non-ionic contaminants (i.e. those that do not contribute to water hardness), then ionic contaminants (i.e. those that do contribute to water hardness). IMO Brita and similar devices are just shitter versions of the same thing; they seem incredibly wasteful, so I don't use those anymore. Of course, a reverse osmosis system will remove fluoride if it's present in your water, so make sure you brush your teeth well in that case."
57190,"pH is a scale that(typically) ranges from 1-14, from 1 to 6.99999... it is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions(H^(+)) (how acidic it is), from 7.000...01 to 14 it measures concentration of hydroxide ions(HO^(-))(how basic it is), and 7 is neutral(neither acidic nor basic, roughly where tap water is).  The scale itself is logarithmic (each increment of 1 is an increase of 10 times, i.e. a 6 is ten times more concentrated than 7, 5 is one hundred times more concentrated than 7, etc), and changes from measuring acidity to basity because when you mix an aqueous acidic solution with an aqueous basic solution the hydrogen ions bond with the hydroxide ions, forming H2O.  However, drinking water that is more than one step away from 7 can be dangerous, both because of how reactive acids and bases are, as well as toxicity from whatever substance is dissolved in it.

TL;DR: Yeah, pH does relate to waters purity.

Whether water is hard or soft refers to concentration of dissolved minerals, like limestone or calcium carbonate.  Water extracted from rivers or lakes *tends* to be softer than water extracted from aquifers, however local conditions can cause significant variation.  Hard water is more of an issue for maintenance of infrastructure and plumbing than a health issue, worst it will realistically do is dry out your hair or skin.

Aquifers are large underground volumes of water, typically found in formations of porous rock that are between layers of impermeable rock, as opposed to being underground lakes (though water can dissolve away enough rock to form them).  Springs are fed by aquifers, as they are often under pressure.  They are replenished chiefly by rainfall and snowmelt that percolates through the ground.  However, due to the fact that they're underground it can be difficult to protect them from pollution, and very difficult to clean up should they become polluted.  Additionally, many aquifers are being drawn at a rate that exceeds their rate of replenishment, meaning that unless aquifer water usage is decreased they'll run dry, which is bad for a multitude of reasons."
57191,"To answer the question, hard water tends to have more mineral in it. Part of the reason people don't like it is when it evaporates it leaves the mineral- often calcium or magnesium- behind and you get water spots or buildup around your faucets or deposits gunking up your pipes. I grew up in west Texas where the water was very hard. Nearly everyone in the area had brown stains on the tips of their front teeth from a lifetime of drinking calcium heavy water. The hardness of the water doesn't necessarily make it less good for you, mostly its down to what you think tastes good. As long as you aren't living in Flint, Michigan-like conditions, tap water is usually just fine and imo, best since it doesn't contribute to plastic waste or stolen water from places that need it (looking at you,  Nestle!)"
57192,"A minor but important thing: the taste of your water might be tainted by the dish/dishwasher soap you use.

It sounds funny and might be outdated but to my detriment the taste discouraged me from drinking tap water. Bottled water wasn't really an option at the time so I ended up drinking a lot of juice and soda. :("

57194,Depends on where your tap water comes from. Ours is literally getting bottled and sold by a water company in some sort of deal with our town and it's the exact same stuff that comes from our tap. A friend who lives in a large city brings empty gallon jugs when she visits us because her tap water tastes bad. I've had it and it does not taste good to me either.

It's friggin awesome, I have a separate tap for filtered water that we use for drinking, making coffee, etc. I feel so fancy when I use it but it's really not that expensive and wasn't hard to install either. Well I had a handyman buddy of mine do it so it was super easy ha ha."

The Naya water that we sell at my store (Lowe's, western Canada) claims to come from Quebec, and tastes much better than the Nestle.  Our tap water in Calgary comes from one of two glacier-fed lakes in the Rockies and has been tested for MacLean's (a Canadian news magazine) as some of the best tap water in the world, so I only bother with the bottled stuff when portability is an issue."

Another reason to buy bottled is if your local tap water is unsafe, either from the source or your tap.

Usually, it is better to drink tap water. It is significantly cheaper, and has less of an impact on the environment. Bottled water has led to droughts in some areas with little financial return to that area. 
Personally we filter our tap water because we don’t like the way it tastes, though it is perfectly safe. It also helps remove any dirt in the pipes that may be present.
