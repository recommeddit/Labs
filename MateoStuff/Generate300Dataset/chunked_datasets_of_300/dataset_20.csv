6514,Is it still on Netflix? I can’t find it
6515,Evil Genius
6516,"Gave this one a watch earlier this year, did not expect it to go there lol. Super riveting loved every moment of it."
6517,"Greatest events of ww2 in color. 

Contains what it says on the label. Recolored footage from the major turning points in ww2."
6518,"Watched this! Couldn’t believe they had all of that footage laying around, felt surreal watching all of it."
6519,The Civil War is probably my pick
6520,Listening to Shelby Foote tell stories and anecdotes is a real treat that never gets old. RIP.
6521,"This and The Vietnam war and The War. All by Ken Burns. Music is phenomenal. Downloaded The Civil War album. The Ashokan Farewell will bring tears to your eyes.
Try to combine The War with “Supernova in the East” in the podcast series Hardcore History by Dan Carlin."
6522,"""The Great Hack""."
6523,"Another great documentary. To watch them break down the entire Cambridge Analytica scandal was fascinating to say the least. 

Karim Amer did a great job of not only shining a light on them, but also on the new threat of information mining in general. But I have to say Britany Kaiser was getting on my nerves the entire time lmao."
6524,Thanks for this recommendation!  Really enjoyed the breakdown and eye opening look into data mining.
6525,"Three identical strangers...starts off as one thing, and goes somewhere you never imagined it would go. It’s amazing and absolutely worth a watch."
6526,"I never watched this one! Just gave the trailer a quick look and it looks super interesting. Definitely giving it a go, thanks!"
6527,Came here to suggest this! This was a wonderful doc!
6528,It’s no longer on Netflix.
6529,It's on hulu if you have it
6531,As You have watched so many what are your thoughts on the question?
6532,"For me personally, I would definitely have to recommend Wild Wild Country for anyone who hasn’t watched it. Hands down one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen, and I’m still shocked all of this actually happened and I had no clue about it lol. 

It’s a limited series documentary on Netflix based on a controversial cult leader (Rajneesh ‘Osho’ Bagwan) who builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert, and shortly after conflict ensues with the locals and his followers which escalated into a national scandal. 

Found it to be extremely compelling, don’t want to say to much and ruin the gist of it but I highly recommend giving it a go if you haven’t already!"
6533,If you liked *Wild Wild Country* then you absolutely need to watch Documentary Now's parody version with Owen Wilson called  *Batshit Valley*.
6534,"Just finished watching, it was absolutely hilarious haha. Thanks for the recommendation!"
6535,Glad you liked. Most all of the the Documentary Now  episodes and their documentaries they parody are top notch imo. Not all are on Netflix but those that are make sure you watch.
6536,"Wild Wild Country was crazy good. Didn't know about it until after I watched it either, still can't believe they managed to build there own city, banks, and all of that. Shocking stuff honestly."
6537,The Keepers
6538,"Not gonna lie, I watched just about the first 40 minutes of the first episode and felt like it just wasn’t as interesting as I was hoping it would be. 

Does it get any better after the first episode? Think it’s worth going back and finishing up?"
6539,It's been a while since I've watched it so I can't remember what the first 40 minutes covered.  But this is a murder mystery replete with cover ups ; so it gets good.
6540,"I think I’ll give it another go at your recommendation! Don’t think I have it a fair shake haha, thanks!"
6541,It's awesome and terribly sad.
6542,The story has so many layers and twists as you continue to watch it
6543,"[Wormwood](https://www.netflix.com/title/80059446)

From the director of The Thin Blue Line. This doc series blends real life interviews with incredibly trippy and extremely well acted/directed reenactments. A frustrating mystery that I still think about all the time, and I never see it discussed or even brought up; one of Netflix's best hidden gems."
6544,"Is the one about the running still on there? The Barkley Marathons it's called I think. Maybe not the best, but the first I thought of. It was super refreshing and fun, for a topic that didn't really interest me before."
6545,"Icarus is one of the best documentaries on any platform. As you may be aware, it’s also an Oscar winner.

The story goes from an autobiography experiment by the director/writer/initial main character, but takes a sharp turn and literally leads to the recent decision to ban Russian athletes from any and all international sports competitions. They had previously been banned from competing under their flag at the last Olympics, but the scandal has been found to be much worse and the ban is full."
6546,"The Vietnam War by Ken Burns

Very informative and thorough. Really enjoyed it :)"
6547,"Gunna have to agree with Icarus, The Devil You Know is also REALLY good.

But if you’re looking for a change of pace The Barkley Marathons is a fun ride (not sure if it’s still on Netflix)"
6548,The devil you know was an eye opener. Good doc.
6549,"Is the Devil You Know the one on Hulu? On Netflix, I see “The Devil We Know” about Teflon products"
6550,My bad yea it’s The Devil We Know
6551,"The Wild Wild West

About a fascinating Indian godman/philosopher’s stay in the US amidst controversy."
6552,Do you mean Wild Wild Country?
6553,Oops. You are correct.
6554,Someone in the thread asked what my pick would be and I said this one haha! Probably the best documentary on Netflix in my opinion. I had no idea any of that happened until I watched the doc. Crazy stuff.
6555,Watched whole series yesterday while working from home. Man it was amazing.
6556,Senna
6557,Haven’t heard of this one yet? What’s it about exactly?
6558,Race car driver Ayerton Senna and his dominance in racing. I don't care for racing and it was really good. Make sure not to read up on it because going in blind made me enjoy it so much more.
6559,Senna is my second best movie on the list. That guy had all the money but still he worked so hard and was so ruthless in driving. Great one to watch.
6560,Imposter
6561,Couldn’t find any documentary with that tittle on Netflix? Do you know if it’s still on there or what it’s about?

6564,Behind The Curve is a truly great one. Surprised it isn’t already listed
6565,This was super good! I couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of some of the perspectives throughout the documentary but all in all it really was amazing
6566,Struggle: The Life and Lost Art of Szukalski
6567,"Making a Murderer, 
Searching for Sugar Man, 
The Fear of 13"
6568,These are all great docs! Searching for Sugar Man was amazing just wish it was longer than it was haha. Definitely the shortest documentary I’ve watched.
6569,True. But so uplifting. The concert scene gives me shivers every time.
6570,"The confession killer! It's an incredible story, has you double guessing your own theories the entire time."
6571,This documentary was really good. The cops pissed me off at every turn. I was angry watching this the entire time lool!!
6572,Icarus or CitizenFour - both are must watch but for vastly different reasons.

There are documentaries that I'm glad I watched and are probably better made, like Icarus, but these are my favorites. And I'm counting the last two, close enough."
6597,Wild Wild Country kinda freaked me out. I really had a difficult time determining the sincerity of the people interviewed. Which I suppose is good when the subject is a criminal conspiracy/cult.
6598,No doubt.  The person you like the most might just be the worst person involved.

The Wrecking Crew - it’s about a group of session musicians from the 60’s who played on hundreds if not thousands of records.  Many of them top 40 hits and you wouldn’t even know they were on the record because they never got credit.  They’d put the official band members on the album sleeve but the wrecking crew more often than not were the ones playing on the record"

6615,"Any new iPhone will get you at least that many years. The 12 mini will be closest to your current form factor. I had a 12 pro and “downgraded” to the new SE because I just was a bit nervous having $1,000 in my pocket. It is fine for me. I am the same way you are with social media, camera, and apps. I would wait to see what they release in September. They may have a new mini that would suit you well. If you want something bigger, the regular 12 (or 13) non-pro would work. 

I used to work at Apple, so I’m a big fan."
6616,I second waiting until September.
6617,The 12 Mini is the best phone I’ve ever owned. Amazing leading smartphone in a form factor that isn’t basically a tablet and you only have to compromise a little on the battery life. I love it.
6618,I love my mini. It’s great having a phone that easily fits in my pocket again.
6619,Nice! Almost went with the mini but I needed a new phone at the time and the pro came out first. They’re awesome.
6620,"Apple said they aren't making a mini in the next models coming out, so if you like the form factor of your SE, go 12 mini."
6621,"They killed production of the 12 mini, yes. They are still expected to release a 13 mini before ending it in 2022. 

https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/iphone-13-mini-assembled-by-pegatron/"
6622,"Oh cool, good to know thx!"
6623,"In 2018 I upgraded from my (wonderful) iPhone SE to an iPhone X and it still works as smoothly as the day I bought it. I got used to the design changes within a day.

That being said, If I were you I would go for a X S as some of the earlier X models have display issues that are most likely not covered by warranty."
6624,"What does the ""S"" mean for an XS?"
6625,"“We’ve put in the next generation chip (A11->A12), upgraded the cameras, and put a longer-life battery in a X case.”"
6626,Spot on.
6627,"Not small sadly it will be quite a bit bigger than your current phone(same size as the X). I’m also looking at upgrading as my battery is fairly bad and my screen is now cracked on my 7. My main frustration is that if you want a smaller phone, the only options really are 8 (which is also fairly old at this point), SE gen 2 or 12 mini."
6628,"I have an SE 2nd version, since my original SE died a year ago. Bit disappointed by the form factor (its significantly bigger than the original) but otherwise a decent phone and hundreds cheaper than most of the other IPhones."
6629,"I am in the same boat, I also have a back up SE to limp by if needed. I am hoping I can wait till 2022 and they will have another small form factor phone. I don’t want something the size of a graphing calculator in my pocket."
6630,"I will be going back to apple soon after a 4 year experiment with android.

While not bifl, apple provides software and hardware support for it's handsets far longer than most Android phones.

There are two Android phones going the user replaceable components; fairphone and teracube with hopefully more to follow just so you are aware of alternatives.

Iphone 12 mini should be at a really good price once the 13 comes out in September supposedly.

The SE2 is probably the best option currently."
6631,"Some weird responses here. If money is a concern then the iPhone 11 will meet all your criteria and will be officially supported by Apple for at least four more years, although will probably last you longer. If price isn’t a concern then you’ll want to wait until the new iPhone comes out next month and buy any one of those with the newest chip on day one. It will likely be officially supported for around 7 years, but you could probably squeeze 10 years if you’re content with no security updates after ~7."
6632,"If money is the main concern, the SE/2 is cheaper than the 11 and should be supported for just as long as the 11."
6633,"I had the 1st gen SE as well until a couple months ago, got a bit over 4 years out if it which Is pretty good haha just upgraded to the 12 mini and I love it, I hate how big phones are nowadays so when I saw the 12 mini was announced, I knew that was going to be my next phone. As far as longevity goes, getting one of the newer models with the latest hardware should allow your phone to function as long as possible before any issues. I would also suggest that after about 2 1/2 years maybe 3 that you no longer update your iPhone. After a few years those updates can really slow down your phone and make it nearly unusable"
6634,"I just bought a new to me iPhone X and am very happy with it! I was upgrading from a 6s. I find that iPhones are actually very robust and will last and last. I only replaced because the 6s was going to no longer be supported in this coming year. 
My husband has an SE and is wishing to get a similar small phone but is going to wait a year or so for them to be less new/desirable. There a lots of reputable resellers on eBay and I can send you the seller I like if you send me a DM. They have a great exchange policy and good reviews. I sent back one phone because the charging port seemed a little worn out and they replaced it right away."
6635,Even when it is “no longer supported” it gets security updates for a really really long time. My iPhone 6 was still getting them and almost every app worked just fine on it
6636,Which seller did you have a good experience from?
6637,Their eBay name is: bidallies
6638,Wait and see if the 13 Mini is any good. Release next month (if shortages aren't too bad)
6639,"Currently have the iPhone 12, but wanted to mention something other users haven’t:

It might be beneficial to have a phone with the most storage if not close. Even if you don’t use up all your storage, it helps your phone run smoother and longer over time. Hope that helps :)"
6640,"Depending on how fancy you wanna go, I would pick out the iPhone that most appeals to you and just replace the battery when it comes to it. My husband has been using my old iPhone 6S Max for 3 years now (we replaced the battery right before he inherited it as it was already 2 years old) and it’s working perfectly. I have a Xs that I plan to use for another 2 years at least (gonna replace the battery soon to get the most life out of it). I figure 5 years for a device is pretty good! My brother has been using an Android for 8 now but it’s really unable to do much and he fights with it all the time. Not worth the headache IMO. 

I would buy a new (or newish) iPhone with the most storage available, and run it into the ground."
6641,I went from iPhone 5SE to iPhone 8. Both were 2nd hand. I’m typing this on the iPhone 8. It’s fine.
6642,"I was using an iPhone 6 I got from my mom until recently, now my younger brother is using it.

I’m currently using an iPhone 7, again used from my mom."
6643,"Does it have to be an iphone? I used to o be an apple disciple but tried switching to android and love it. For what little you use your phone for, you really don't need an iPhone. I use a moto g power, bought about 6 months ago. $50 for Google Fi users, which I also recommend. The battery life is great and it does absolutely everything I want.  I would expand your horizons and see what's out there! iPhones are great but they're really not the only game in town anymore. Maybe they never were,  but I only woke up to how good the quality of other phones can be a couple years ago."
6644,"See, I switched from Androids to Apple a few years ago, and my iPhone has held up far better than the Androids I’ve used. 

I’ve been using the same iPhone since late 2018 with no noticeable decline (slight decrease in battery life, but nothing major.) My Androids of a comprable level (so not the bare bones cheapest ones, but not the most expensive either) struggled to function well once I hit about 1.5 years with them. I treat my phones the same (which is to say, not very well 😅) with the same level of daily use, of tossing them around, updating them the same, etc. And so far I’m incredibly happy with my iPhone, and probably going to get at least another two years out of it before it starts to struggle. The only reason I’m considering upgrading it at all is for 5G."
6645,"The problem with Android is that most vendors are crap at long term software support. I say this as someone who always uses Android too. With Android you're lucky if your vendor gives you 3 years of new updates, with Apple you get like 5 years. It can be difficult to recommend that to people that want to keep their phone a very long time unless they're comfortable installing custom ROMs to maintain the latest software versions. The issue isn't so bad anymore because Google delivers many parts of the OS via the play store now but I'm still very sceptical. I had my OnePlus One for 6 years because of custom ROMs, and I've just bought a new phone a few months ago but I'm sceptical how long it will really last without me installing a custom ROM in a couple years."
6646,Samsung (and I'm sure other vendors as well) sell some phones as enterprise editions with 4 years of security updates guaranteed.
6647,"My iPhone 6 is still getting security updates and now my younger brother is using it. It works just as well as when I first got it like three years ago (and my mom was using it before then) 

iPhones last a really long time in comparison to a lot of other phones"
6648,"That's cool but it's not all about security updates. With each Android version comes a new API and eventually developers stop supporting the old versions or getting a degraded experience. So your apps stop working.

That still doesn't match Apple's support with full feature updates which doesn't match the standard on desktop operating systems. 10+ year old hardware can run the latest versions of Windows and Mac perfectly fine."
6649,"Second this. If your family has iPhones, you can use other video chat apps… many more budget and battery friendly options when you look into androids"
6650,"I have an iphone x and using it w google fi.

I will be switching to android soon"
6651,I like my iPhone 8 a lot
6652,"Possibly look at the smartphone reliability scores - 

https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability

If it’s not BIFL, then something highly repairable is the next best thing."
6653,"all the iPhones are 6-7, and the highest repair ability ones I did not recognize the brand at all (other than Google, which I know they update their phones for a while iirc).

Not recognizing the brand likely means that they won’t be getting security updates a few years down the line.

iPhones, although slightly less repairable, are the best option software side of things in terms of longevity."
6654,"Would tend to agree with minor exceptions. Fair phone is quickly gaining traction especially for its eco friendly features, and with easily replaceable and upgradeable components it should last you QUITE a while. 

Terracube is also a great option(and the only thing we can get in the US as well haha)"
6655,Is terracube in Canada?
6656,[Yup!](https://myteracube.com/) They ship to U.S. and Canada!
6657,"In 2019 I upgraded my aging Iphone 6s after having it for four years to a new Iphone 11.  The first week I kept telling myself I should have upgraded a long time ago.  To this day, no regrets - love it.  If you consider how much you use your phone on a daily basis and the convenience/power it has, the price/use is still fairly low."
6658,"The 11 should last another 4 years and will get another price drop in September after the 13 is announced. I read it has a good battery and has the night mode on the camera, which could prove useful. That is my plan for upgrading next month. That, or a price-dropped 12 mini…"
6659,"I recently upgraded to an iPhone 12 from an iPhone 8. I'm a mild social media user, play very casual games (like solitaire), I FaceTime my girlfriend every day for 1/2-1 hour, and I can go a day and a half at least on one charge. I'm pretty sure the mini less battery life, and coming from someone with very small hands and a regular sized iPhone 8, the mini was too small for me. The Max is just a bigger version of the more recent iPhones, and the Pro just means it has the 3 cameras instead of 2."
6660,"I bought my first iPhone SE in 2017 and it lasted me up until this year. In my experience, smart phones last at most 4-5 years before software updates and battery issues render them difficult to use.

I kind of hate the new iPhone SE. I got one but it has no audio jack, it's too big, and the glass body is almost designed to break. The original iPhone SE was a perfect phone in every way. This phone is not a worthy successor. But it's okay."
6661,no iphone. slightly old samsung = best bang for buck. no smart phone is bifl
6662,"My friend got a refurbished SE for ~300 bucks(can probably find it cheaper), has had zero issues and worked beautifully. If you're worried about battery you can always try to find an iPhone 7 Apple battery case, will fit and work just fine. Just might be somewhat pricey as the used market is a little lacking for it. Managed to get one for 50 bucks used. Pair it with a decent screen protector and boom you're good for a while.

But, I hear rumors they're going to release an upgraded version of the SE this year or early next year. 

They're also supposed to release the next version of the iphone ""mini"" which might also be the last version. Like others have said probably the closest thing to what you have, so if you want something similar in size and shape I would hold off for a month to see what they drop. 

As always, get a good quality case and screen protector. HIGHLY recommend flolab screen protectors. Nothing beats them especially for the price. 

Try and get an eco friendly case if possible(if you don't need a battery case), otherwise that stuff is wasted material that's now stuck here forever. Recommend GoNimble or Pela cases.

Alternatively, 
Fair phone is quickly gaining traction especially for its eco friendly features, and with easily replaceable and upgradeable components it should last you QUITE a while. 

Terracube is also a great option(and the only thing we can get in the US as well haha)"
6663,Went from se to se2 and it works great for a all day user. Could use a bigger battery of course. Battery is 90% after a year and a half so that sucks and AppleCare does Not replace batteries for free.
6664,"Whatever you choose to buy, I have a few recommendations. Firstly, don't buy new. Paying 1000+ for a device that's gonna last a few years isn't advisable imo. There's this website called BackMarket that I've used, where they sell you certified refurbished stuff at pretty good deals. I'm talking like, 200 dollars for a Samsung Galaxy S10, and pretty good quality too. I got my own phone (Oneplus 7 pro, 256gb) from the website a couple months ago for around 220 dollars, and honestly it feels like a brand new phone out of the box, aside from a few microscratches here and there on it. Not an advertisement or anything, just my personal advice for getting the best bang for your buck in terms of mobile devices. 

Also, charge your devices properly. Do you use 100-0% of your battery range? That's what desroys the battery quickly. I recommend keeping it 20-80% as the ideal sweet spot for the battery, it's the best range to keep any lithium ion batteries, and it more than doubles their lifespan from that alone. Also, keep it away from getting too hot. My old phone, I charged it that way for 5 years and by the time I replaced it, it felt like it still retained 90%+ of it's original battery capacity.

BIFL isn't all about buying a certain device, it's also how you maintain it. If you don't stress the battery, keep it in the ideal range, use a cover and a screen protector, you can easily extract 5+ years of service out of your mobile device. At that point, you'd be replacing it out of desire for something newer, rather than necessity. To replace out of desire rather than necessity, now that's what I like to call true BIFL quality."
6665,Find another SE. I went from SE to 6S then back to SE. Its the best iPhone they ever made.
6666,"I have considered that. But isn't the processor too old at this point to handle the majority of apps now?

For example. I cannot run both maps navigation and spotify at the same time on my current SE without it skipping and freezing and tweaking out. I thought that was a processor problem."
6667,"I would replace the battery on your current phone. I have an iPhone X, which granted, was considered ""better"" than the SE, but it's been 4 years and I have no major issues."
6668,Yes i agree the battery degradation could be the cause of some of your software issues.
6669,I did this with my (old) SE for about $80 and it still works great!
6670,"I have an iPhone SE 128GB… not the newer version of SE’s, the old one. My buddy found it in a box while moving last year and sent it to me. I reset it and I’ve had 0 problems with it. Running the newest OS as well."
6671,"Based on how you use your phone and the “digital minimalist” term, I’d suggest a dumb phone. You can even get them with Bluetooth and hotspot capabilities so you can still use modern headphones and wireless speakers, if you care about those features."
6672,"I've tried living with a flip phone for a while actually. In the end, not having maps/GPS, spotify, or a camera really made my life more difficult. Also, I supplement my income by working the gig economy (Uber Eats, DoorDash, InstaCart) and need a smartphone for those"
6673,"Ok. If you wish to get an iphone SE 2020, know that it's fine other than the really small battery. If you often keep it topped up with a power bank, it ain't bad for gig work."
6674,That makes sense!
6675,"My suggestion is a Xiaomi or a Moto. Moto are built to last, they run smooth, and have decent everything for their price point. They might not have a flagship camera, but they can often outperform flagships in battery life, they just aren't pretty and lack bells and whistles"
6676,"I have to disagree here. Typing this on my Moto One that I bought for 150€, I've seen lots of good looking Motorola phones in the last few years! (and recommended lots more as they're generally a lot of bang for your buck)

That being said I'm going to switch back to Apple in september. But that's for personal reasons as I came to more and more dislike Google so closely attached to a device I carry with me 24/7. So I'm willing to pay more for the device and less with my data later on..."
6677,If you really want longevity get an Android with a replaceable battery. The battery always dies several years before the phone is genuinely obsolete.
6678,In my experience iPhone batteries degrade significantly slower than Android phones. Have a 7plus that still has 85% battery health. Apple will replace it in store for $70 iirc.
6679,I got the battery replaced in my 8 and it runs like new. It was $50.
6680,I have an iPhone 6 that has been in constant use for the past 7 years and has had its battery replaced once. It is still going strong
6681,"What do you do with your phone? Why are you sold on getting a smartphone? Dumb phones do still exist, and arguably look better than ever."
6682,I'm in the same boat. The X is off the table for me as it was released in 2017. Based on the form factor of your current iPhone I would wait for the iPhone 13 to be released then buy an iPhone 12 mini secondhand. Try to buy as new a phone within your budget to maximize software support and security updates. I'm in the same $100 per year of use mindset. Current S8+ user.
6683,"I wouldn’t do a secondhand one, simply because the warranty is usually far more limited than if you buy new. Even certified refurbs seem to be quite hit or miss."
6684,"In the U.K. CEX does a two year warranty on second hand devices they sell, though I know less about how good it actually is."
6685,My iPhone 6 is still getting security updates like 7 years after it was released. That would be the least of my concerns
6686,"All I can say is do NOT get the XR. I've regretted it since buying it. Works fine but it's just a bit too large/clunky, it clearly is lower quality than the other phones. I bought it when the 11 was out, and should have bought an XS instead."
6687,You’re not a big social media person but you’re on reddit? Doesn’t being on Reddit automatically qualify you as a social media person? I could be wrong but I don’t log into Reddit on my computer. Only on my iPad and my iPhones.
6688,"Hello /u/Enkoodabaoo4! Thank you for your submission! The AutoMod thought that your post might be a request type post and has changed the flair accordingly, but if this was wrong feel free to change it back!

6689,"The new models are usually announced in September, so if you can limp through another month, you might want to wait."
6690,My wife got the 12 mini and she loves it
6691,I usually get an older generation with max memory. Each time they have lasted about 4 years.
6692,Get the mini. That’s all.
6693,typing this on an iphone 8+ - still gets updates and runs fine! bought secondhand.
6694,"Typing this on an iPhone 7 hand-me-down from my mom. It runs perfectly fine.

Recently I upgraded to it from an iPhone 6 (from the same source) that I gave to my brother. It still is getting security updates and works fine"
6695,"Buy a cared-for iPhone SE2 128GB with two Smartish cases (AppleCare expires May 2022) like mine! :P

I'm not sure that the battery life of the 12 mini is better than the SE2, but if you want 5G for the future, 12 or better is a no-brainer."
6696,Get the SE. Battery life shouldn’t be a problem if you are a digital minimalist. Mine tends to last me an entire day without much fuss and I use my phone often.
6697,I have the 12 mini and love it. It’s the perfect size for me
6698,I tried a demo 12 mini in the AT&T store today and it felt soooo cheap. Was it just because it was the demo version? What was your last phone? I am trying to upgrade from a 6s and am having a hard time deciding what to get.
6699,"The 12 mini is minimalist in a sense. It’s super light and a bit smaller than the SE or 8, and with good battery life. 

As far as tech minimalism, have you researched the Light Phone II? It’s interesting. I’ve only read about it."
6700,"Iphone mini, wait until September"
6701,Moto G. Cheap. Reliable. And you can load lineage OS on those bad boys which means no tracking from big companies if you opt into that.
6702,I loved my iPhone SE original too but finally had to bite the bullet and upgrade earlier this year. I went with the iPhone 12 mini which was the closest form factor without the silly curved screen like the second SE and other models had which I disliked. Couldn’t be happier my choice and the size was close enough to not be annoying. Price was only only sticking point but I reasoned if it lasts as long as my last iPhone it would be worth it. Time will tell if I made the right call I guess.
6703,"I’ve got the new SE and it’s very good. If I was to go back in time though, I’d have liked to have known about Fairphone and taken a gamble on that. Looks like a good phone and more ethical than apple products."
6704,"For long term use, the two main important points are software updates and repairabiloty.

iPhones are impossible to repair. I would suggest you to get a fair phone.

I do not use one as they are not available where I live.

Fairphone.com"
6705,"I moved to an SE 2020 after my original SE was getting too unusable. I like it and it’s perfectly fine for everything I need. Battery life isn’t all that bad for me honestly. It seemed huge at first but still much smaller than the other iPhones at the time. Really hard to beat for the price and barley shows signs of wear in the year or so I’ve had it. 
If I were looking now I’d seriously look at the 12 mini though. Better screen and form factor and will be more future proof than the SE 2020 so should last even longer."
6706,"I have the 2nd gen SE and came from a 1st gen SE and the battery seems fine to me. My old battery barely held a charge tho, so anything would seem like an improvement, but I have my head in this stupid thing like half the day, and usually only have to charge overnight."
6707,"Is changing your iPhone battery an option where you live? 

My 1st gen SE has been with me close to four years, with a battery replacement in 2019. There hasn’t been any performance degradation besides the reduction in battery maximum capacity."
6708,"to get several years out of iPhones, I believe you’ll have to get a battery replaced at some point. There are places that do it, and online sellers with kits. Probably easier to have someone else do it. Also you’ll need to figure out how to maximize that battery life. GL"
6709,I have the 11 pro and the battery life (which is the most important factor for me) is amazing. I've had it for a year and a half
6710,"I’m a fan small phones
I have ab iPhone SE. it has decent camera ( portrait mode).

I use mint mobile.
224? A year?  Work fine for me"
6711,"new old iPhone7
iPhoneSE new gen?"
6712,"The debate following the OP on which one of the most famously throwaway-culture supporting, obsolescence-planning, overpriced, non-user serviceable company's phones is the most BIFL one -- is the wrong one to be having. 

Get an LG V20.  Mine is 5yo, has 128gb in expandable storage via a microsd slot, and a third party 10500mah battery. It suffers from zero issues, and any part that breaks I can either buy and replace myself or send it to my repair guy who does this stuff for a living. It's sitting beside my x230, twice that age, same thing.  No one ""needs"" a Mac or an iPhone.  The world would be better off without them."
6713,The new iPhone comes out in September I believe . And it's the one that finally catches up to all Android specs .. 120 hertz and all that jazz ... I'm sure it will be pricey unless you get the mini but in my opinion with iPhones build quality being the best you can buy in any phone brand (s21 ultra user myself ) I'm gonna buy the new iPhone.
6714,"Well an iPhone or Samsung flagship is $1000+ 

So if you don't need it, you can go with another brand. I suggest android with a replaceable battery.

I'm got a Motorola. It's got a good camera, midgrade but still good processor, and the battery lasts for several days. It was under $400."
6715,Any phone will last years if you put it in a case and use a screen protector.
6716,"iPhone X. Face ID and OLED display aside, it's the first relatively small iPhone with decent battery life. I hate plus-size phones."
6717,">I hate plus-size phones.

Me too. I was happy to jump from my 8 plus to the XR just to lose some bulk.

All I really want is an XS sized phone with XR battery life. Looks like the 11 Pro hits that mark more or less but I buy a new phone every other generation, so I'll probably get a 12 Pro I guess."
6718,I'd love to see an SE sized XS.
6719,"Absolutely. I think the SE might be a little too small for me, but I would definitely give that a try."
6720,If they ever build (I doubt it) a full-display iPhone X in the size of the iPhone 5s I would seriously pay 2k for it.
6721,">	I would seriously pay 2k for it.<

Shhh!! 😠🤫"
6722,Dude out here giving Apple ideas. RIP $800 phones.
6723,that's the upcoming iPhone 12
6724,"Hopefully, yes."
6725,thats my dream phone.
6726,Did you get what you were looking for with the 12 and now 13?
6727,"YES, absolutely! When they unveiled the 12 Mini I was blown away and immediately pre-ordered it. It is the perfect iPhone for me and I am so happy with it.

But I don‘t upgrade to the 13 Mini because I think the differences are minor."
6728,"Gotta agree, love my XS, good size, battery and features. I know depth touch is dead and daily useless, but it’s nice in artistic apps and games."
6729,you would love the 11 Pro then. exact same size as the X but with a much better camera system and amazing battery life. mine is a year old next week and i can still get 2 days out of it (97% health and jailbroken)
6730,Definitely. Been on the X since launch and it’s going strong. If the 12 doesn’t wow me too much I may hang on to it for one more year.
6731,"Second that. I have now the 11 Pro from work but I would have kept the X for years to come. It’s the perfect form factor for me and battery life compared to the non plus sized phone is great. 

And the 5 at launch. After all, that design stayed on for almost a decade."
6732,That’s my least favorite model to date. Too heavy for one handed use.
6733,"4. IMO the biggest upgrade in iphone history. Retina display, beautiful new design. Way better camera and build then the previous."
6734,The 4 was the first time I actually felt the hype for a piece of tech. Legit looked like it came out of a sci fi movie
6735,"Remember when it leaked, what a story. Then it turned out it was already leaked a year before in the iPad 1 leak. It was just so different from normal no one spotted it.

https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/is-this-the-apple-tablet/"
6736,"I’ve got a soft spot for the 3GS cause it was my first one. Best I’ve had was the 8 plus. I’ve got an XS max now, but mask + Face ID = pain in the ass."
6737,"ever since i updated my iPhone to iOS 13.7, my Face ID has been working with my mask on."
6738,Mine seems to be working occasionally but it’s not great. Maybe 3 times out of 10. Hoping iOS 14 fixes it.
6739,Can you train it with a mask on?
6740,I’ve literally never thought about just adding a profile with my mask 🤦🏾‍♂️ you are genius. I hope you are having a great day wherever you are 🤣❤️
6741,At least the last time I tried it it said to uncover my face.
6742,"I had the 3GS and Ioved it. It was my first smart phone. Now I have the 11 Pro Max. Man, technology has really advanced."
6743,"3GS was magic to me. I had the original iPhone, and moving from Edge to 3G, adding a video camera AND an App Store made the touch screen magical again. Comparing to the Motorola Droid, G2, and Xperia, it might not have had the most impressive functionality, but damn it was a showstopper."
6744,"6S - it’s still going strong, still getting updates and while I have the 11 pro now (which is amazing!), my grandma has my old 6S that will stay relevant for a while."
6745,"iPhone 4. Gorgeously engineered, retina display was incredible, HD video and 5mp photos were incredible.

... no, iPhone 5. LTE was incredible, tall screen was dope.

... no, iPhone 6. Big screen was cool.

... no, iPhone X. All OLED screen was incredible, in such a relatively compact form-factor.

... no, iPhone 11 Pro. Battery life and camera are incredible.



... no, iPhone 4. I've not loved any phone as much as I loved that phone."
6746,5s had the best design and best feel in the hand. But my current 11 is obviously the best. I absolutely love it.
6747,The 5s was probably the most excited I’ve ever been for an iPhone because I was switching my wife and I back from our year on Android. It felt great to be back on iOS.
6748,i’m still using my 5s for a music player because it’s compact and still have 3.5mm jack
6749,5s corners used to hurt my hand a lot
6750,"If a phone is hurting your hands, you’re using it too much."
6751,Or you are holding it wrong.
6752,"Nope, just what I said. For context, even the most comfortable mattress will eventually give you bed sores."
6753,This was meant to be a humorous reference to Steve Jobs‘ (in)famous line. Perhaps not *that* funny.
6754,I know. I remember.
6755,The 5S in Gold.
6756,"I love the iPhone 5s. The size, the design, everything was just perfect!"
6757,8 plus! (I was an android user forever and then switched to iPhones with the 6 and then went from a 6 to an 8 plus)
6758,I did the same! I loved my 8 plus but when the xs max came out that did replaced my love for the 8 plus😭
6759,I got my 8 plus the weekend after launch and I’m still using it because it’s literally the best phone I’ve ever owned. Like I’m going to keep it until it either stops working or it stops getting updates.
6760,Cant get mad at that! The 8 plus really is a solid phone. Definitely in my top 3 favorites.
6761,11 Pro Max for sure.  Battery life is incredible and the camera is simply amazing.
6762,The OG SE was my favorite. The size was perfect
6763,This was my first iPhone and I loved it!
6764,iPhone X. Magical device from the start and still great after 2+ years of using it.
6765,"I have to agree with you. I upgraded from the 6+ and it still blows me away. I wish I had gotten the Max sometimes, but only because I like a bigger phone. The X is my favourite."
6766,"X

Felt like 10 years worth of research and trial and error to get that device into customers hands. 

Sounds insanely fanboy like, but even with an 11 Pro Max, I regard then X as my favourite."
6767,"6s+

I’ve had two phones since then but still have that in a drawer as a backup."
6768,X. We will finally update this year.
6769,"best looking: iPhone 5, iPhone 7

best function for money: iPhone 11

worst design and function: iPhone 6 Plus"
6770,Xs max
6771,I have a 11 pro max but i miss my xs max cause it had 3d touch i almost dont want the 11 pro max
6772,The 11 doesnt have 3D touch??? Thats news to me
6773,5S was my first. It was also the only phone I’ve ever owned that didn’t have any noticeable issues during the 3 years I had it.
6774,"I have to say iPhone X. Three years later, it still looks like it's got a solid 2-3 years left in it."
6775,"The 4 and the X, best phones made by Apple hands down"
6776,"iPhone 3G in white

iPhone 4 in black or white

iPhone 5 in slate

iPhone 7 in jet black

iPhone X in silver"
6777,7 jet black checking in. Still gorgeous and premium looking.
6779,"No protection at all! Very few scratches, although Apple did replace it once (a year ago) because my battery had started to swell suddenly."
6780,"iPhone X for me. 

I upgraded to every iPhone (except the 5S) in the past, but once I got the X I’ve been happy with it for 3 years. Arguably I didn’t need the previous upgrades either, but the X was truly forward looking at the time. It’s the iPhone I’ve used the most, and I just love most of the decisions they made with the design:

-	the first OLED iPhone 
-	the first “all screen” iPhone 
-	first FaceID device
-	the A11 was their first bionic architecture — being able to use the high efficiency and high performance cores in tandem makes a big difference vs. the A10 fusion design
-	the gestural interface is amazing and essentially defined how a buttonless interface should work industry wide 
-	the rounded stainless steel frame and glass front/back is one of their best looking and most premium feeling designs IMO

Looking forward to the 12, however!"
6781,Definitely the 7 Plus. Battery lasted all day no problem and then some.
6782,The newest ones?
6783,"I’ve had an iphone 5, 6, 8 plus, and currently have an 11. 8 plus was my fav, only reason I upgraded to an 11 was so that I could use my 8 as my work phone. Otherwise, I would have used that phone till its last leg."
6784,"At the time, I really loved the iPhone 5/5S"
6785,"First iPhone SE went strong for so long, just needs a battery replacement and it would still work fine.

iPhone 11 Pro is my next choice, but mainly for the cameras."
6786,"My first iPhone was the 4. That was a huge upgrade for me coming from Android. I’ve also owned an iPhone 6 but currently still using my 7+ which is coming up on 4 years.

My 7+ has been the best phone I’ve owned and I refused to upgrade because of Touch ID. I’m hoping that it comes back one day to the iPhone with an under screen fingerprint sensor."
6787,The 12 Pro when it comes out 😂
6853,5s
6789,"iPhone X in terms of features, but iPhone 4S had the best aesthetics"
6790,Not gonna lie I have the plan where I can trade in the previous years iPhone and pay tax and get the new one and honestly I like it. Every time I get a new phone it feels like it is the new best for me like it just gets better every time...
6791,Isn’t it always the next one?
6792,"5S/5SE

The best looking iPhones ever (excited for the return to this design language). And just before the time where Apple seemed to build products with intentional lifespans. My 5SE is still rocking strong with no issues aside from the battery. I love this phone."
6793,iPhone 4S. Newer iPhones are workhorses - but that was a piece of art!
6794,Iphone 4 felt like a huge leap
6795,Original. Was a tank and was so much better than anything else. I didn’t upgrade mine until the 4 or 5. Still got it in a drawer. I’m getting misty eyed now
6796,My current phone.   SE gen 1
6797,I had many.. but 11 Pro Max is the one with least compromise and least complaints.
6798,I really like my 11 Pro Max
6799,"Tie between the X and 11 Pro. The only reason I even got the 11 Pro was because I switched from Sprint to Verizon, and they offered me something like $700 in trade in credit to upgrade, so it would have been foolish not to, lol. Otherwise, I could see the X lasting me another 3 or 4 years."
6800,"The 3GS was a game-changer in its time.

I still have and use a 6S, which set the baseline for a number of models"
6801,"Picking up the 1st gen will always be #1 for me. I still remember everyone thinking I was out of my mind when I bought it, the rest is history!"
6802,My last one so the 7 Plus had it until April last year.
6803,5 or X
6804,8 plus and still using it.
6805,The iPhone 4 with its retina display.
6806,"My first iPhone is the 6+. Still on it, still works beautifully. Had this thing since like two weeks before the 6S and 6S+ were announced and don't plan to upgrade until this thing turns into a paperweight."
6807,7+
6808,"1.	XR
2.	7
3.	5
4.	6

As far as a GOAT, consensus has circulated around the iPhone 4 for like 6 years. I never owned one but I’m inclined to agree."
6809,"3GS was my first iPhone so it was the biggest change in moving from a history of crap smartphones (Windows Phones back when they were running CE and Palms) but then the 4 with its new form factor, Retina display, great camera and performance was a game changer"
6810,"My 6s plus was the one I held onto for the longest, and that phone served me very very well for a long time! The 4s was another phone that I fondly remember."
6811,Still chugging along with my iPhone 7 from November 2016.
6812,"From going to the OG-4,6 and 11 pro.. easily 11 pro"
6813,"iPhone 5, really like the straight edges, glad they are going back to that style for the 12."
6814,"XS Max truly feels like it could be ‘future-proof’. Performance has held up, multitasking is smooth, design like a modernized take on my old favorite black iPhone 4, and iOS keeps getting more polished as time goes on. 

Plus it came at a crossroads as the first Max sized display, with added battery life from Plus line, and the last iPhone with 3D Touch. Haptic Touch is alright, but compared to LIDAR and a 3rd camera, it is part of what I use throughout the day, daily."
6815,I have been a big fan of my XS Max
6816,"My 11 is my most favorite. Have had the 3G, 5, 6S, 7, 8, 8 Plus. No plan on upgrading until there is something really worth me upgrading for."
