7136,"The sides are definitely slippier though. They get... oily? Not sure what's happening. May be the black coating, I had a silver before

Had to get a case for the winter"
7137,"Getting the OLED screen was worth the premium of the 11 Pro to me, but the 11 is definitely a better value."
7138,"I bought the 11 because it doesn‚Äôt have an oled screen, PWM gives me headaches"
7139,"Best phone ""for most people"".  Not the best phone period."
7140,Arguably the best phone for most people is the best phone you can buy. No one said it was the best phone period.
7141,Verge specifies ‚Äúfor most people‚Äù because you‚Äôve got the nerds who insist they can‚Äôt live without Windows Phone Live Tiles or Android NFC tags
7142,Can't iPhones do the NFC tag stuff with iOS 13?
7143,"I just want an always on display, damnit."
7144,"If you are so sure of that, then what is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù?"
7145,"I'd still take my OnePlus 7 pro over the iPhone 11. 90hz 1440p OLED with 8gb of RAM for less than $700


""Best"" is just incredibly subjective to be honest."
7146,"My opinion is irrelevant.  I have not even used an iPhone 11 or any phones on the market.

My point is the article itself says iPhone 11 is ""the best phone for most people"", not ""best phone to buy right now"" like OP's title says."
7147,[Here‚Äôs a link](https://www.theverge.com/pages/wallpapers) to those üî•üî• wallpapers
7148,"I ordered a red iphone 11 last week, can‚Äôt wait to pick it up next week. Finally getting rid of my 6s."
7149,"The bezels on the iPhone are fucking crazy, coming from a oneplus"
7150,"Yeah, but..... Its the verge. So a few grains of salt are needed."
7151,anyone have the wallpaper that‚Äôs shown on the iPhone 11? ü§ß
7152,[It‚Äôs on their website](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19207592/The_Verge_iPhone_11_Wallpaper_01.0.jpg)
7153,ahhh thank you!!
7154,The screen though... resolution / color are noticeable if you‚Äôre coming from oled
7155,What color to get though? That‚Äôs such a difficult choice...
7156,"I like that the 11 comes with 128GB option.

That should have been the case on the Pro, in fact it should have been the base storage."
7157,I would say the 11 is the most complete phone on the market for the price point
7158,As usual : )
7159,"I don‚Äôt know why they needed to make the phone so damned big.  

Even my 8 feels a little big for my run.  Going to an even bigger screen, and a heavier battery to me feels like a huge step back.  

 And before you say Watch is what I should be using for that I‚Äôll say that the battery doesn‚Äôt last long enough for any kind of long runs.  Even with the phone with me my watch battery can‚Äôt last the whole day on my long run days.   If I add a cell connection and playing music off the watch I shudder to think.  

As for all the other advantages, like wasting more time on social networks and watching you tube those things seem like the kind of good idea that eating an entire dozen donuts in one sitting do. Sure they‚Äôre fun to do but I don‚Äôt want that all the time anyways."
7160,Side bar: Does anyone know what wallpaper that is?
7161,"Am I the only one who bought an 11 Pro Max, mainly cause of the battery life?"
7162,I just want my 4S form factor.
7163,"Yeah as much as i like my 6s and the 11 i‚Äôm getting next week, all of them still feel really big."
7164,"Basically, unless you want an Android for whatever reason, buy an iPhone. Plus unlike the XR, the 11 has 4GB of RAM like the more expensive models."
7165,"Ever since those guys posted that horrific PC build guide video, I can‚Äôt take them seriously."
7166,The Verge recommends iPhone 11 as the best phone? \*faint\*
7167,As opposed to what? Every year they recommend the iPhone as their top choice.
7168,"You want the latest chips, so se2 is probably the best bet.   If you want to keep it for 5 years the older models will get a lot more sluggish.  
11 maybe best if you like the bigger form factor, otherwise se2 is mostly a 11 in a smaller form factor."
7169,"Shows how out of the loop I am, I didn't even know of the SE üòÇ 

I just checked them out, I think you're bang on the money - they seem to be really good value. And given that I don't care about form factor (it seems to be almost identical to my current 6S) then I reckon this might be the winner. Thanks."
7170,"upgraded from 6s to SE, theoretically, i have the fastest phone in the market."
7171,I just upgraded from a 5S to the new SE. so freaking worth it.
7172,This again? Apple DOES NOT slow down old iPhones
7173,"yep, None of my iphones, 3G, 4S, or SE1 have ever slowed down. It's apps become bloated, demanding more. Snapchat used to work on the iphone  3G when it came out before it became extremely bloated with junk"
7174,"They still do, they‚Äôre just more transparent about it. You can also turn off the throttling yourself."
7175,I meant this ‚ÄûApple intentionally slows down old iPhones to force people to upgrade‚Äù bullshit
7176,They did slow phones without notifying the user. It‚Äôs just unprovable that the motive was to sell more phones.
7177,"As much as I consider it a really stupid choice to hide the throttling (and given the CA lawsuit, I'd say Apple would agree with me now), the motive was clearly to actually keep phones in people's pockets. The slow down would only trigger if a battery died unexpectedly, meaning people who'd be out to replace their phones anyway were affected by the throttling."
7178,More - it can be proved that this wasn‚Äôt the motive: the throttling disappears after replacing the battery
7179,How would one turn it off themselves?
7180,"Under battery health, under where it says ‚Äúpeak performance capability‚Äù it will say whether your phone is being throttled, and there is a link to turn off the throttling"
7181,"of course it DOES NOT however, in natural software nature, every year there‚Äôs a new iOS version which ideally have more features than previous year‚Äôs.

The more features the system has, the more it consumes processing power.

And to add to this, their QA prioritize (i think) newer iPhone models than older models so if your old iPhone happens to be slow due to newer iOS, it‚Äôs just that it is fixable but QA and engineers don‚Äôt have that luxury time to fix for small shares of users.

I have both 6s and SE 2020, 6s on iOS 13 is still freakin extremely fast in terms of gestures and fluidity. But i cannot the say the same for my 2014 MBP 13inch on macOS Big Sur. The performance between Catalina ang Big Sur is day and night."
7183,The only problem with an SE2 is that the screen is almost an 1 inch smaller than an 7 plus. That alone is holding me back from trading in my iPhone 7 Plus for an SE2.
7184,"If you don‚Äôt have another device for multimedia consumption, I‚Äôd say go for the 11 or a refurb XR. The battery and screen is definitely worth the extra money."
7185,"Yeah, id been debating an SE2 but ultimately decided against it because all that power doesn't do anything if the screens too small and low res for me to see any of it"
7186,isnt the battery bad
7187,"I just got an iPhone XR yesterday with the A12 it‚Äôll still probably be supported till 2024 or later.. and it‚Äôs still fast as hell, and the battery lasts me 2 days on a single charge. Had it yesterday for the first day at 100% and used it for 4 hours straight without shutting off the display and it only went down to 73%... it‚Äôll definitely beat the XS or XS max in the battery department for sure, and the screen is better than people think, it‚Äôs the pixel density that matters and this has a higher pixel density than the iPad Pro and everyone loves that display... This thing is a beast still and it‚Äôs the perfect size, not too large like the max or plus phones but bigger than the smaller iPhones for sure. I love it so far! Plus if you go the used market you can get it cheaper than that price sometimes. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this phone. It‚Äôll last you at least 4 years if you need it to without any issues."
7188,"Out of interest, why didn't you go for the XS which is a similar price?"
7189,"Personally I found this at a 40 dollar cheaper price which every dollar counts in my budget right now, and because of the better battery life, the XR gets almost double the hours of screen on time the XS gets, not sure about the XS Max but that was about 150 dollars more than the XR I bought. Also I actually prefer LCD because OLEDs use pulse width modulation to control the brightness (basically rapidly flickering the display) and that makes me and some other people get headaches after using it for a half hour or so straight and can even cause dizziness or nausea. I just get a headache more with an OLED, the screen on this is perfectly fine as it has a pixel density of 326 and the LCD contributes to that longer battery life, and can still play 1080p video it just scales it to the display since it has a high enough pixel density. Still a gorgeous display. It‚Äôs also compared to the standard XS (not the max) is a larger display at 6.1‚Äù verses the smaller body and screen on the XS. It‚Äôs perfect, not too big not too small. I‚Äôd honestly recommend this over the XS because of the battery life, larger display and over all size over the XS, and it‚Äôs cheaper in most cases if you search for the right deal."
7190,"Ah fair enough. In terms of price, and looking specifically at refurbished models in the UK, I actually managed to find an XR deal for only ¬£424 compared to ¬£470 for the XS. I guess nobody wants the coral ones üòÇ Their loss.

Interesting about the display though, I have had problems with screens before. Thanks for the tip.

EDIT: Worth noting though that that refurbished XR price is still more expensive than a brand new SE."
7191,"Bigger and also higher resolution display, Face ID, and two day battery on the XR makes that price difference justifiable for me."
7192,"I thought the SE looked like tremendous value for money and will get great support, but I had to have a new phone and Apple kinda drug out the release so I have the 11 now.  

If you hold on to your phone and won't likely break it, I'd get something from the 11/SE group or wait for the new ones soonish. I don't like buying old tech that I know I'm going to use a lot and hold onto for a while. For me the iPhone window is 3 years. After that the battery starts to slide for how much I use a phone. If you got a deal on the 11 when the new ones drop that would still give you a good 4 years of updates."
7193,"Just replied to /u/radio_yyz regarding the SE, I think you're both right. Good shout on waiting until the next round of releases for a price drop. I should be able to eke another 1-2 months out of my poor, frail 6S...

Thanks"
7194,My girlfriend got the SE and it is pretty nice even compared to my XS. If I didn‚Äôt prefer the full screen OLED Display it would also be an option for me. Even if I sometimes miss TouchID these days when wearing a mask and having to unlock my phone with FaceID.
7195,The 11 and XR are LCD displays. Just in case you didn't know.
7197,Honestly apples OLEDS are as color accurate as the LCD‚Äôs since accuracy is what apples known for. Just be sure True Tone is off. Burn in on the OLED iPhones seems to be quite rare I know people with iPhone X who have yet to see burn in even after much use. Apple has done some magic on the OLED displays. Although there LCD‚Äôs are great the OLED panels only get better.
7198,Lmfao
7199,"I think... an iPhone 8 would be the best bang for your buck when it comes to software support, since you yourself showed it costs almost half of the X while likely getting the same software support. Also I use one and I don‚Äôt really have performance issues anyways."
7200,Thanks for making this post OP I'm kinda in the same boat
7201,"Yeah no worries. Consensus seems to be SE for value and longevity, but XR and 11 have significantly better battery life."
7202,I think I'm leaning slightly more towards the SE rn
7203,Yeah me too. Having the most recent processor seems like a good move.
7204,Get a Xs max. The XS is infamous for having a poor battery life. Unless you aren‚Äôt a big phone person. Bigger is better ;)
7205,"Damn, I thought it was how you use it..."
7206,"I got a used iPhone X for 200‚Ç¨ from a good friend and it works freaking amazing. All games I play work flawless (CoD Mobile), very good battery life, very good camera, the whole OS is fluid.
I think I can easily keep the phone for 2-3 more years."
7207,11 (regular)
7208,"I think you should wait and buy an iPhone 12 with 256 GB storage, if you're someone who's not careless with your phone. (If you break the screen a lot, or are likely to lose it in a river or a club, get the iPhone 7 or 8.)

With a used iPhone, you can never be 100% sure of what you're buying. Battery might disappoint you. It won't feel like much of an upgrade, and the model might stop being supported in just two years. If you buy a large storage iPhone 12 now, you can pretty much guarantee 5+ years of quality use. (My 6S turns 5 this November.). I personally believe 5G will be such a milestone for the iPhone that the 12 and 12 Pro will be supported for like 8 years."
7209,"XR is the best value, SE is the best if you only want to buy new and XS Max if you want the bigger OLED. Though I'd wait for the 12 launch, those older models should drop in price a bit more."
7210,Fuck you for calling it ‚ÄúEcks S‚Äù. Its TEN S
7211,"Yeah, I should be in jail."
7212,"Looks like an Ex Ess, sounds like an Ex Ess. It‚Äôs an Ex Ess"
7213,Who cares what they call it?
7214,Because its objectively wrong.
7215,Imagine caring this much
7216,Now you're just taking things to Teness
7217,Fuck you for being a smartass
7218,"I‚Äôd say that the XR fits your needs pretty much in that order. The battery is incredible! The screen is nice, and the camera is great! It‚Äôs hard to buy a phone with a bad camera these days though."
7219,Just get a new battery for ur phone
7220,Try to find an iPhone X
7221,"For best budget right now, 8 Plus. Had it for a year before upgrading and had amazing battery and the screen is great... I at times thought it looked better then a friends Samsung OLED panel. Cameras are decent too even if you aren‚Äôt looking for that"
7222,*cries in Xs max*
7223,"Just got a refurbished 8 for 430‚Ç¨. Should arrive on monday and to me it's a bit over my spending limkt for phones (400) but i guess it should be worth it. 

I'd say 7 if you're really after a budget phone.

8 is in between.

XR if you have the money to spare i guess."
7224,"iPhone X. Still is the ¬£1000 phone it was in 2017, but a lot cheaper now"
7225,"Lul when i want little upgrade for my 5s to 6s
I think you should just replace your battery"
7226,It‚Äôs an amazing phone and I love mine :) but tbh I would get the 11 (if you can afford it)
7227,Same. The 11 would last longer
7228,"Thanks! Your advise was pretty wise so I decided to buy 11 and wow, that‚Äôs a big difference after 4 years of using iPhone 7, literally, I almost forgot what it feels like using fast device. Thanks again man and everyone who replied to me!"
7229,I'm glad to hear that!
7230,"I came from a iPhone 7 maybe a month ago. Just go and buy it, don‚Äôt have how to compare it. Have an amazing camera, ridiculous battery, longevity, processor, a great big screen and I‚Äôm sure that the next iOS will be smooth, don‚Äôt worry about it"
7231,"At this current point I would suggest at least an iPhone 11. You can get it for only $100 more than the XR on the Apple Store and it‚Äôs probably better in almost every way. Keep in mind that the XR phone is getting close to 3 years old, so something newer is probably the better choice"
7232,The iPhone XR will get plenty of updates. There hasn‚Äôt been any software additions that relied on a newer chip yet (minus camera)
7233,I think Xr will perform fine for regular usage till iOS 16 after that maybe it‚Äôs gonna be tough. If you aren‚Äôt really are a heavy user and just want it for usual phone stuff and some hours of social media and entertainment this phone is great.
7234,"I would recommend the 11 for the extra 100$. Better proccessor, battery, cameras, especially cameras and youll have the U1 chip."
7235,"I love my iPhone XR but nope. Buy a IPhone 11 for almost the same price. Ultra wide camera is really nice to have, I miss it (had a LG before). But you don‚Äôt get nightshots on XR. The camera is just ok really."
7236,"Man i just got mine for 450 128gb, which is really good in just country and 200 dollars cheaper than iphone 11. If you can spend the extra money sure go for the 11, but since you are considering the xr it means that you don‚Äôt want to go much further (just like i didn‚Äôt). Came from an Oneplus 5. The screen is very good don‚Äôt be deceived by false claims, my oneplus had 1080p OLED screen and this one is just as good if not better. The experience is buttery smooth, no lag, no stuttering, even on low power mode. I‚Äôd say go for it."
7237,"I bought a XR brand new on mid January this year and I must say I don‚Äôt regret a single thing. I‚Äôm
not much of a photographer so the single camera on the XR is perfect for me for the occasional picture. The battery lasts all day and it‚Äôs very fast. When I compare it to my dads 11 I can‚Äôt find a big difference in terms of speed and screen quality.

I also upgraded from an iPhone 7 and the difference is huge. I was gonna get the SE but decided to go for the XR instead to feel a bigger change and get that extra battery. For $500, this phone is insane value and should last for at least 3 years more."
7238,"Too old to get updates? It is still up to today‚Äôs standards. It‚Äôll still have a lot of updates for the next years.
I‚Äôve had mine almost since it came out and I still have friends who buy it today. It is a very nice phone. Although, if you have the cash, go for an 11, not much more and has some more benefits."
7239,"If you can, get 11 instead of XR.  Also Apple will always tune their OS according to the phone specs so it can perform accordingly, if I were you I won't be worry about it too much"
7240,"I would highly suggest getting an 11 if you can within the budget. Yes, the Xr is a great phone but at the same time it is heading towards 3 years old."
7241,I got mine almost 2 months ago and I would definitely suggest you to buy it
7242,"I would recommend the iPhone 11. Way better cameras and it‚Äôll be supported for longer than the XR. The XR isn‚Äôt a bad phone, but I‚Äôd recommend the iPhone 11 unless you don‚Äôt care about cameras. Apple really improved in the photography area from the jump between the XR and iPhone 11. The XR‚Äôs camera is okay/average, IMO. Not ‚Äúbad,‚Äù but it can‚Äôt compete with the iPhone 11‚Äôs."
7243,I had an Xr i sold it cuz i needed the money i really liked it but i am using my 8Plus and have been on and off for 3 or 4 years and it is still going strong
7244,Bought Iphone xr back january. Still having 99% batt percent. 4 months pastb having its ios 14.2
7245,"Xr and the 11 are practically the same  phone,my 11 and xr both fit the same case,however the  camera on the 11 is better,xr is still a good phone though and should last a couple of years  and it's cheap,its really up to you but it is a good phone stillüëç"
7246,"Go if you are okay with 
1. thicker bezels compared to iPhone 12 and up
2. Lcd display
3. Slightly thicker and weighing body
4. Good enough camera in well lit conditions. When compared to 11 and up it can‚Äôt really compete. 

If i am a person who don‚Äôt get lured to latest models every year and stick with one device for more than 3 years then i will buy device which will be futuristic. Based on this point IPhone 12 or at least 11 is better choice compared to xr.

Meanwhile performance and quality wise xr is already a top notch. But i am not sure if i can say this beyond ios15."
7247,"Also
- U1 chip (for details Find My devices)
- Qualcomm vs intel Modem chipset |edited
- Main camera^(2 vs 1), better Portrait mode and Night vision"
7248,"Slight correction: iPhone 11 too uses intel modem,exactly same as XR.It‚Äôs only the 12 series which uses Qualcomm‚Äôs X55 5G modem"
7249,"Hey, even though I am not an iphone user, but trust me, never buy a mobile phone, which is older than 1 year.
The reason I am saying this is because mobile technology changes within 6 months and bi a to your mobile will surely affect in battery life since even though you are buying it today it might have been manufactured way before.
Now a days in advance of iPhone 12, iPhone 11 is a good choice to buy.
I recommend you my pal to pitch in some more money and buy the iPhone 11.
You will not regret, neither will your mind wander to another phone choice..."
7250,My 7 is like 4 years old and it‚Äôs had about 12 display replacements till now and no home button it works flawlessly
7251,"Minus display for me, camera is great not two camera System, but this one is nice, other all is super."
7252,"Yeah, got mine in 2019 and plan ob keeping in for at least 2 more years. Will upgrade only for 5G. If it had 5G would probably keep it for 3+ years."
7253,"From what we've seen so far, it will be an incremental upgrade over the 11. But I will say this, they've been dropping the price of their base model iphone from XR to 11 for example. So, if you can get by on your current phone, wait till the 12 launches. If you want, you can buy the 12 at that time, but the 11 will be even cheaper by then."
7254,"I bought the 11 immediately after it came out just because my old phone died and the ten series was essentially discontinued. I think you may wait and find it‚Äôs a super long time, or you might commit and it comes out in a month. I kind of wish I waited for the SE2, but I‚Äôm happy with the 11. I would just do the Apple upgrade program with the 11 if you think you need the 12, but the iOS 14 will come to the 11 too, so"
7255,"Looks like the iphone 12 will have an oled display, that new iphone 4 boxy design and a really compact 5.4"" screen. Its reported to be cheaper as well, all of this with the addition of a rumored blue color is enough for me since that boxy iphone design is nostalgic to me, i really like compact phones and compact flagships are becoming increasingly hard to find and they are bringing a navy blue color which is my favorite color. The 12 and 11 are gonna be really different phones, depends on your preferences. I would recommend to wait for the iphone 12 and if you dont like it the 11 will be cheaper."
7256,"Personally, I'm torn, because in my personal opinion, the 11 pro is one of, if not the prettiest phone ever made, and the 12 pro, from everything I've seen just looks ugly with that LIDAR sensor.  

However, you're talking about base models, and the 12 is rumoured to come with 5g, and that alone makes it worth waiting for."
7257,Definitely the XR and AirPods pro
7258,"bought the airpods pro with degree money, def loving them (already have an XR)!"
7260,Probably given apple track record it would definitely last more than 3 years from now
7261,Yes you should. I got mine in January 2020 to replace my aging 6s. It‚Äôs a great device! Hey same I don‚Äôt play games on my phone either ü§£ü§£
7262,Do you think games kills the battery health ?
7263,"They actually do. On my old iPhone (6s) games ruined the battery completely. I got it refurbished, battery health 85%. After a while the capacity was already at 80%. I send the phone back and got a different 6s. It was working perfectly and then Apple got that 30‚Ç¨ battery replacement. So we did that replacement at an official Apple store, and while getting home the phone didn‚Äôt charge... battery completely dead. Imagine an official Apple store broke my phone. The next day my father went to another Apple store and they checked the phone and said; yes it‚Äôs completely dead. So they handed over a completely new 6s. After 1 year the phone started to age. Because the 6s is just an old device. And in January 2020 I got an brand new iPhone XR and I‚Äôm very happy with it! Conclusion: I‚Äôm
Never playing games on my phone anymore. Sorry if this is a little bit too long ü§£"
7264,"I‚Äôve had mine since launch, and have had very very minimal issues with it. For your use, it should be more than fine, but for longevity, I‚Äôm not too confident. I made my 6 last 4.5 years after getting it at launch, so making a phone that‚Äôs already about 2 years old last another 4-5 might be pushing it. You could always replace the battery in a few years and make it last a bit longer. 

In my opinion, I always suggest getting the newest phone so you have the newest processor and battery to make it last. But from how you‚Äôve phrased this it seems like you‚Äôre on a bit of a budget, so it‚Äôs hard for me to give you a solid answer. 

If longevity is your main priority, go for the newest one you can afford and wait for the AirPods to go on sale. If you really really want the AirPods as well, then the Xr isn‚Äôt a bad option."
7265,"I‚Äôve been rocking my XR for 1 year and 2 weeks. My gf has a 11 and basically we feel like they‚Äôre the same phone apart from the wide lens on the 11. Battery life is amazing, everything is amazing. It‚Äôs working flawlessly since day 1."
7266,"Hi there!! The XR, if treated well, can last 5-6 years without a single problem. Today (yeah, a big coindicence lol) marks a year since i bought mine (coming from a 6S) and battery life has been fantastic since day 1 (still at 98%), camera is awesome and performance is as good as day 1. Go ahead and buy the XR, youll have a great time with it :)"
7267,"Good, that's a relief :)"
7268,"even if you buy it now, you‚Äôll probably go all the way till ~ios 17 (speculating ofc). you‚Äôre good there."
7269,Get the XR as battery life is great.I still use my iPhone 6s plus on 13.5 and I just got a new battery works great now but I will update to the iPhone XR as the battery life is great.If I had the money I wou buy the iPhone max pro  but hey the XR is good enough if you  don't mind using the LCD display.I would love an  OLED display.i wish Apple made an OLED display for the next XR2
7270,Thanks for your reply! I actually prefer LCD over OLED as it uses less power and it doesn't have burning risk like OLED.
7271,I still prefer the dark pixels of an Oled display and display uses less battery life on an Oled
7272,I would suggest you go for the 11. There will probably be a nice discount on the 11 and it will probably have more years of support for you. I have an XR and enjoy it a lot but 2 year old tech will usually get abandoned 1 year before 1 year old technology (the iPhone 11)
7273,Correct.. think the same
7274,"I got a refurbished XR last month and I love it! I upgraded from the 7 plus. I absolutely love the XR, since I don‚Äôt need anything special on my phone as long as it lets me check social media lol. 

Plus, it works better with my budget-brand wireless earbuds than my 7 plus did.

If you‚Äôre okay with refurbished phones, check out Back Market. I‚Äôve bought all of my Apple products from there and it really makes them more affordable. And they have a 1 year warranty in case anything goes wrong. Legit got a 2013 MacBook Air for $200 last year from there."
7275,I was in a similar situation as yours. I just bought an XR and I‚Äôm loving it. Judging by your intended usage I don‚Äôt think the extra cost for the 11 is worth it especially if its huge ( currently around 210 dollars in my country) plus the AirPods Pro would be the cherry on top!
7276,"What about the iPhone SE 2020? Is that a variable option in your country? Newer chip in the device, and about the same cost as the XR (Give or take)."
7277,"I don't know... It has huge bezels, small screen and insufficient battery. But on the other hand it is cheaper, better longevity and as you said better chip and camera. Hard to decide"
7278,"The intel modem sucks.  The rest is pretty good, great battery life."
7279,Best investment! Xr and airpods pro! Have both and they‚Äôre üî•
7280,"Once the 12 is released, the 11 will replace the XR at that price point. So you might be able to get the 11+AirPods Pro."
7281,"yeah i think the xr would fit well. i have an xr and i do pretty much the same things as you lol. the xr is strong on the battery game, im at 91% health and it still goes all day. i would say go for it, and you can even get airpods pro!

btw, the 11 and the xr have the same screen so they're pretty much the same thing you're not really missing out lol"
7282,That's good to hear! I probably will buy XR but I have some concerns as it is 2 years old. How many years do you think I will be able to use XR without needing to change phone?
7283,Very long time. The 6s is almost 5 years old I guess and is going to support iOS 14
7284,2-3
7285,"well my family had a 5s from 2013 to early 2020 and it held up perfectly fine aside from being slow. then i shattered it and we officially retired it. my point is, it should work perfectly fine even though its 2 years old. we will eventually see it showing signs of aging maybe on its 4th or 5th birthday, but that happens with all devices anyway."
7286,"> I want to use a phone for 4-5 years. 

For 2-3 years I would say go for the XR, but if you want it to last until 2024 or 2025 then I say don't.  
The phone was released in 2018, so in 2024 it will be 6 years old, that's super outdated. Just for example, the iPhone 6 is 6 years old now and iPhone 5S is 7. I would either go for a newer model or get the XR but lower my expectations."
7287,"I bought the iPhone XR and AirPods Pro in March, and let me tell you is a great idea!"
7288,"Replaced my 6s with the XR almost two months ago. Lovin it!!! Definitely recommend this phone, but not if you pretend to keep it for 4-5 years (although I find it difficult to stay with the same phone for that long)."
7289,"Yes, get it! Best bang for the buck by far!"
7290,"I‚Äôm personally upgrading to the iPhone 12 this Winter mainly for the OLED screen, but if you don‚Äôt care about that, I can definitely see it being good for your uses 4-5 years down the line. Not sure how long Apple will support it, but it probably won‚Äôt be as bad of a slow down as the iPhone 4/4S on its final iOS update"
7291,I got my XR last week. I absolutely love it. You will too I am sure!
7292,"I've had my XR for just over a year now after getting it back in May of last year, and I see no reason to upgrade to an 11 (because it's only adding on the 2nd camera and especially not now with the the 12 coming soon)."
7293,Just make sure the pice goes down before u buy it. The phone itself is designed to last at least 5 years
7294,If you can‚Äôt buy the 11 then the Xr is a great option. As a photography junkie I miss not having the second camera but my almost 2 month old Xr is doing just fine.
7295,"Got my XR last May and I would say it‚Äôs been great! In front, both the XR and 11 is similar since nothing is changed in the display so it‚Äôs goes down to whether you prefer having the wide angle cam or not. I previously owned LG G6 which has a wide angle camera that I barely use simply because of the lower photo quality. I wish to have telephoto lens tho because portraits looks better with it nevertheless it‚Äôs a great phone!"
7296,"Bought mine last month, everything works perfectly. Everything is great about this Phone, i think the only difference we‚Äôll notice will be the new features added to the new phones, apart from that i hope the experience we‚Äôll have will be pretty much the same in the coming years"
7297,Maybe the 11 will get a price drop and then you can go for 11 and the AirPods Pro. Hope for the best ü§ûüèΩ
7298,The X Ä is still a fantastic device that won‚Äôt let you down.
7299,"Believe it or not, I‚Äôm using an iPhone 5s and waiting for my XR delivery. I‚Äôve bot this one in 2016, and it still works really good (the problems are just update releases and the battery), but it works just fine. I believe the XR will perfectly last 4 or more years."
7300,"Bought my XR dis June 2020. For its still the best phone up to this year. No lag issues, no bugs, camera‚Äôs still at the peak, processor‚Äôs still fast and lastly the battery is so great! 1 charge for just a day!"
7301,yes i have the xr and it‚Äôs great! my sister has an 11 and from what i can tell it‚Äôs the same phone with a better camera. the internals are better but normal people don‚Äôt usually notice that stuff.
7302,"I would suggest go for 11 after 12‚Äôs launch, it will definitely get a 100 Dollars price cut. According to me an iPhone will last upto 5 years from launch. Basically XR is good until September 2023. If you are planning to use the phone for more than 3 years than don‚Äôt go with XR, go for 11 instead."
7303,"I just got the xr a month ago, one hundred percent recommend it especially with any airpods"
7304,"There are people who buy new iPhone SE, i know the soc updated, but if I had to choose I definitely pick the XR over the SE (2) for the display, FaceID, soooo Yes go buy your iphone XR and the airpods pro, loving that little white things!"
7305,"If you don‚Äôt play games and just need a big phone, every iPhone since 8plus are still good considering you want to use for 4 years and assuming you want to have updates coming your way."
7306,Buy it one of the wisest things to do.
7307,I have to make up my mind -still have my iPhone 6s Plus with a new battery installed last month but I want an upgrade -I do like the iPhone X as it‚Äôs a premium built phone and has that Oled display -so it‚Äôs either an iPhone XR which is not that much of an upgrade from a 6s plus as it has less pixels.so it‚Äôs either iPhone X which I feel has the best design. iPhone XR v iPhone X

7325,Good catch
7327,"I'd say that you should look at business grade devices if you want good build quality. So, Latitude from Dell, EliteBooks from HP, ThinkPads from Lenovo, etc. I don't think that any company offers as good user repairability as they once did in the past, unfortunately, but there are still good options out there."
7328,Hello. I see that the Gateway 15.6‚Äù with the Ryzen 5 3450U and Vega 8 graphics is also listed on your gaming laptop post as well. Is the HP 15‚Äù with Ryzen 5 5500U and Vega 7 also suitable for gaming? Which is the better buy if both are listed at the same price?
7329,"The HP would be the better choice because it is from a more recent generation, so despite only have 7 CUs, it will out perform the older Vega 8."
7330,"Thank you so much for the advice. A couple more questions, how significant of an improvement is the Evoo i5 10300H GTX 1650 and is it worth an extra $200 over the HP?"
7331,"It is a pretty large improvement, so it is definitely worth paying $200 more for."
7332,Thank you so much. Picking a laptop has always been a daunting task. You‚Äôve made it so much easer. I appreciate your help.
7333,I was thinking about getting the HP Pavilion Gaming 15. I was looking in the $500-$800 range for something that could do some gaming. It usually goes between $700 to $750ish. Would you recommend something else over that?
7334,"Hi, is there a particular configuration of it you're looking at currently?"
7335,"Nothing too specific. I would prefer to at least have 500 gigs of space or at least have the option to upgrade drive space. Not too picky, whatever has the best performance and reliability for the price."
7336,"I'd go for the [**Lenovo Legion 5 15""**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-AMD-Ryzen-R5-GTX-1650Ti-8GB-256GB-1TB-Gaming-Laptop%2F627433588&partnerpropertyid=1768915) that is on sale currently. Ryzen 5 4600H, GTX 1650 Ti, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, and a 1080p 15.6"" 120Hz display. It is one of the best options for the price currently."
8017,I'm happy to help.
7339,"I am absolutely horrible at making decisions, so I am hoping you will help please! 

I am going to be starting college in the fall. I‚Äôll basically just need the laptop for online classes, research and using Microsoft word to do papers. 
Which laptop do you recommend most from your list in the 300-499 range? 

Battery life and weight don‚Äôt matter too much to me. I just would like for it to load up quickly and not be too loud with fans."
7340,"Hi, if you want something cost effective, the Gateway 15.6"" on my list with the Ryzen 5 3450U CPU is a good choice. It offers very solid specs for the price, but if you want to buy from a more reputable brand, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14"" on my list is a good choice too."
7341,"I am definitely eyeing that gateway one! 
I haven‚Äôt had a laptop or computer in years, so brand recognition doesn‚Äôt mean much to me at this time. 
I really appreciate your feedback and list! Thanks so much! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
7342,"I'm happy to help, let me know if I can help with anything else."
7343,"Hey, thanks for putting this list together! I've scrolled through a few of your threads and am always blown away by how thorough you are. You rock!

I was hoping I could pick your brain for a minute. I'm shopping for a laptop on my own for the first time and I could use a bit of guidance. 

I'm a college student looking for a laptop for general use and light gaming (the latter not being a necessity, but would be nice). Good battery life is a must, preferably not super heavy or bulky, and preferably <$1000. I also am not looking for a 2-in-1, just a standard laptop. 

Currently using a Dell Inspiron 13 that's nearing the end of its life. I've been overall happy with this laptop, but it's given me issues with the sound and has an awful battery life. As long as these issues can be avoided, I'm open to just about anything. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!"
7344,"Hi, as long as a 16"" device is okay, the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i Pro 16"" on my list is a very good value. It can handle light games and has an excellent display, which makes it a standout option."
7345,"Hello! I‚Äôm going to start college next month and need a laptop for the first time! I‚Äôm overwhelmed! I‚Äôd appreciate your help:) 
I don‚Äôt game, would like good battery and not too heavy of a device. I will only need it for online school and writing documents, but Id like it to be fast and not laggy... price up to 700 or 1000 is fine:) do you have any recommendations please?"
7346,"Hi, you definitely can't go wrong with the Apple MacBook Air on my list. Great battery life, good screen, strong performance, etc. Otherwise, if you'd like a Windows device, the Acer Swift 3 with the Ryzen 7 5700U on my list is a great choice."
7347,"I need a new laptop for casual use. Things like running DnD campaigns, making DnD maps, general web surfing, light Office work in Word and Excel, and things like that. I really want to make sure that is is reliable and fast. I'd like to be able to upgrade it if I need to. I know very little about the technical side of laptops other than that newer generations are better than higher numbers when it comes to processing, and SSD is better that HHD (I don't know what this actually means). I'm not super concerned with graphics cards as I won't be doing any serious gaming on it, but I'd like to be able to upgrade eventually if possible.

I was looking at the HP ENVY x360 because I thought the 2 in 1 would be useful during DnD campaigns and the pen would make drawing maps easier. It also seems to have good options for memory (16gb). Do you think this would be overkill for my needs? Also, does it have the ability to upgrade its memory and storage after the fact to save some money initially?

I'd like to stay generally around the $700 region, but would go up to $1000 if its going to be worth it and the laptop will be relatively ""future proof."" I'm wary of unknown brands, but I'd trust your opinion, given your wealth of knowledge on the subject.

If you could give me your opinion, or some better options based on my needs, I'd really appreciate it."
7348,"Hi, if you want a 2-in-1, the HP Envy x360 is definitely viable, but you'll likely have to go over budget. You could consider the Lenovo Flex 5 14"" on my list as a cheaper 2-in-1 option. Otherwise, if you want something as future proof as possible, a gaming laptop like the [**Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/lenovo-ideapad-gaming-3-15-6-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-5600h-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-rtx-3060-6gb-gddr6-shadow-black/) would be a good choice. It has better upgradability and stronger specs."
7349,"Hey, Im starting uni soon and I just want a general use laptop.

I'm looking for anything 15 inches or under 

Minimum i5 or its amd counterpart 

No dedicated graphics needed 

The most important thing I need is a good screen 

This is optional but I'd love front facing speakers.

Any suggestions?"
7351,Under 1k dollars
7352,"I see. I'd go with the ASUS Zenbook 14 on my list. Ryzen 7 5700U, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS 400 nit display. It should be fine for general use programs."
7353,Would this be better than the Lenovo ideapad 5 or the Acer swift 3?
7354,It depends on the configuration and price.
7355,"Do you know which of these has the best screen?

I've been looking all over the web and every website has a different answer"
7356,"Out of these 3, definitely the Zenbook."
7357,"Hey really sorry to bother you again mate, I've looked everywhere in my region and I couldn't find the Zenbook.

Do you have any other reccomandations?"
7358,I have heard bad things about gateway laptops?
7359,"They aren't very reliable, but they offer decent specs for the price."
7360,"OK. I could use some help buying a new laptop for my wife.  Can go up to $1000. She had a lenovo before and really enjoyed that experience.  Looking for a 15.6 screen, SD port for pics from camera. 2n1 and touch not necessary. Does some photo editing and pretty basic stuff  . Thanks for the help"
7361,"Hi, although it isn't on my list, the [**Lenovo ThinkBook 15 Gen 2**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/BX24O0) is a suitable option. I'd go with the $909.35 configuration. You get a 4-core i5-1135G7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display. It should be fine for those uses, plus it has an SD card slot."
7362,"Hey there, I'm looking to upgrade from a laptop I bought in 2009 ( HP 15 inch screen with 128 gb storage). I'm looking for a good brand, with usb ports and all that jazz, a good webcam, and an average amount of storage. I'm not sure how much storage I need because I only use my laptop sparingly but I would rather have more than less. With how little I use a laptop, I am looking for a cheaper model around the 200-300 range. I also have terrible internet due to living in the country. What would your suggestion be for a non apple laptop?"
7363,"Hi, is a refurbished device is okay?"
7364,I'd prefer a new one
7365,"The new options at this price point aren't great. So if you can work with a refurbished device, I'd go with the [**Gateway 15.6""**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRefurbished-Gateway-GWTN156-4PR-15-6-FHD-Laptop-Ryzen-5-3450U-2-1GHz-AMD-Radeon-Vega-8-Graphics-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Purple%2F135813858). You get a 4-core Ryzen 5 3450U processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display. It is a solid choice for general use."
7366,"Also, would the HP stream 14"" be a decent laptop?"
7367,"Not really, it is very weak."
7368,What's the lowest price range for a good one and what would be your suggestions?
7369,"I'd say \~$430, and I would recommend the [**Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"".**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Ideapad-3-15-Laptop-15-6-AMD-Ryzen-5-5500U-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Abyss-Blue-82KU003NUS%2F529355770)"
7370,What makes it weak?
7371,"The HP Stream? The CPU is very weak, it has very little RAM, and has slow storage."
7372,A bunch of the links in the list go to newegg US and I cannot even find these devices in canada. Specifically I was looking for Asus Zenbook 14' AMD Ryzen 7 5700U CPU.
7373,This list is for US laptops. I have not seen the Zenbook 14 with the Ryzen 7 5700U available in Canada yet.
7374,"My bad, I thought this was on laptop deals canada."
7375,"Im trying to decide between the zenbook 14 with ryzen 7 5700u or Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 16"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 120Hz QHD. I already have a pc that i game on so itll just be for consuming content like YouTube and trading stocks lol. Id like good battery life and for it to be somewhat portable."
7376,"I'd say go for the IdeaPad 5 Pro 16"". Stronger CPU + better display."
7377,"Thank you so much for your response. Should I go with the Costco model or wait for the other one with the GTX 1650 graphics card. I believe they have different graphics cards? Do you know how it would effect the laptop? Links below

What about this one?"
7379,"im shopping for college which starts soon and I am really liking the zenbook 14 5700u config, great screen build quality and touchpad, but it doesn't have a touchscreen. is there another similar 5700u laptop that you'd recommend? the ideapads seem to have horrible color accuracy so those are no gos for me

thank you"
7381,just anything under $1000
7382,"I see. Unfortunately, I don't know of a laptop like the Zenbook 14 with the Ryzen 7 5700U with a touchscreen."
7383,"yeah i did a lot of research myself and couldnt find anything, oh well the touchscreen isnt too important to me. would you consider the zenbook 14 to be the best general use 5700u laptop?"
7384,"Yes, I'd say so."

7386,"Hello,
I‚Äôm an engineering student looking for a laptop on a budget to take notes but also run 3D CAD programs. Most of the 2 in 1 laptops have an entry level graphics card, but I was wondering if the laptop had 11th gen i7 processor from intel, and 16gb ram, would that suffice to do my tasks even though the graphics card is a Iris Xe by Intel? The laptop I was looking at was a Samsung Flex 2 Alpha."
7387,"Hi, what are your school's requirements?"
7388,"Intel I5/I7 10th gen or newer
16gb ram recommend 
Rec storage 512gb or larger SSD
Windows 10 64bit"
7389,"I see. If they don't require the laptop to have dedicated graphics, I'd assume that integrated graphics should be fine. Can you link the Samsung laptop you're looking at for me?"
7390,https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-book-pro/buy/
7391,The only thing I‚Äôm worried is that the CAD programs I looked at for minimum requirements recommend a dedicated graphics card which is hard to find in a 2-1 laptop. I‚Äôm just not sure if the processor would cover that downfall
7392,"The processor wouldn't probably cover that then, the CPU doesn't make up for the GPU. What is your budget? Unless you can spend \~$1,500, you probably will not get a 2-in-1 with a dGPU."
7393,"Budget is under 1000$. Ideal laptop would be to run cad and be 2-1, but looks like I‚Äôll have to give one of those wants up."
7394,I would recommend giving up the 2-in-1 feature. Is that possible for you?
7395,"Hi i need a recommendation pls , there is 2 model right now available for me to buy , the msi gp66 with 3060rtx and intel i7 10870h costing me in local market  1600usd

7471,"Hi, do you have a max budget in mind?"
7400,I think I‚Äôm willing to spend up to $2k‚Ä¶
7401,Are you willing to buy a green laptop skin from dBrand? That would expand your options.
7402,So there is no such thing as a good green laptop? :( I don‚Äôt really wanna use a case‚Ä¶
7403,"A skin isn't a case, so it wouldn't make the device larger or bulkier."
7404,Ok imma disregard the color what‚Äôs the best pick for laptop right now?
7405,So if I don‚Äôt care about the color what‚Äôs your top 1 pick laptop to buy?
7833,What do you plan on using your laptop for?
7407,Just daily use for watching YouTube but I prefer a big internal storage?
7408,"I see. You definitely would't need to spend your whole budget. The ASUS Zenbook 14 on my list would be plenty for your uses. Ryzen 7 5700U processor, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display."
7409,I see. I was actually looking at the Lenovo ones. Do you recommend any of those? I would prefer a big screen and touch screen display so maybe those 2 in 1 laptops?
7410,"In that case, you could consider the [**Lenovo Yoga 7i 15"" 2-in-1**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/b3m49B) instead, the $977.49 configuration with 12 GB RAM."
7411,"Thanks for making this post, as it's been a good minute since  I've done laptop shopping and am still ignorant about what's what.

Looking buy a $1200 or less laptop (to replace my Asus Q524U) that can run simulation and CAD programs simalteneously and seamlessly, as well as (if possible) run newer games like the upcoming Battlefield.

Prefer no touchscreen, as I have heard that it contributes to poor battery life and gradually takes a toll on laptop performance. Lmk if this is completely wrong."
7682,"Hi, does battery life or weight matter to you?"
7413,I lean towards battery life
7415,">good balance between performance and battery life

I'm guess that's why you've recommended it over the HP Envy? And then how does it compare to the Lenovo Legion 5 15?

Also, is there a big chance that the Acer Swift X will get any cheaper/go on sale (i.e.: Black Friday)?

Thanks again for your expertise."
7416,"Yes, the Swift X is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there. The Legion 5 15"" is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life.

It could always go on sale later on, but I don't know for certain."
7417,"Last question (hopefully), lol: 

If I bump my budget up to $1500, does your recommendation change to any of the laptops under your $1300+ chart?"
7418,"I don't think that would change my recommendation much, since the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 is still a bit more."
7419,"This machine?:

7424,"sorry for a very late reply, battery. I was looking into this https://www.microcenter.com/product/637182/lenovo-legion-5-15-156-gaming-laptop-computer-platinum-collection-blue

do you recommend anything better?"
7425,"It's a pretty good choice. Battery life isn't great, but it supports USB-C charging, so you can easily charge it on the go."
7426,"Hi!! Thanks for posting!! This was really informative especially since I have no clue what I'm doing.

My mom gave me 500 dollars to buy a laptop. I'm not picky, I just need something descent that I can use to type essays while I'm browsing. I'm not really big on games but I did recently start playing SWTOR. Got any recommendations?"
7427,"Hi, I'd say go for the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14"" with the Ryzen 5 5500U on my list if you can go a bit over budget. It has decent integrated graphics, so it should be solid for general use and light games. Otherwise, the Gateway 15.6"" with the Ryzen 5 3450U processor is also viable."
7428,Thanks!! Saw it on your list when I was browsing through it yesterday. I've heard great things about the IdeaPad and I think I may have found ehat I'll be purchasing.
7429,"Great, I'm happy to help."
7430,Curious as to why the Lenovo 15‚Äù is cheaper than the 14‚Äù?
7431,"The IdeaPad 3 14"" has a better display."
63848,Thank you
7433,"I'm (USA) in the market for a gaming laptop. Won't you help?

I'll try and list everything I've researched:

* Price $1,200-$1,800 (would prefer best $/value/FPS).
* Weight doesn't matter.
* Likely plugged into a monitor half the time, so (I believe) mux switch is needed.
* Numpad preferred.
* Screen brightness/colors on the better side of ""okay"". No need for super accurate colors when off-monitor. Brightness is nice when not plugged into monitor but not a deal breaker.
* Graphics do NOT need to be ULTRA HIGH MEGA - I am perfectly happy with medium-high for most games. If the difference between high and ultra is $300, I'll go for high.
* That said, if I'm paying above $1.2k, I'd like a laptop that can hang for 5 years+ and still get decent frame rates.
* Max wattage is mandatory (well, I assume based on $/performance).
* Travel will be minimal, so plastic/cheaper case would be acceptable, though not exactly preferred.

For reference, my current desktop is an AMD FX-8350, GTX 1070, and DDR3 12gb RAM. I would hope for a noticeable improvement from a new laptop.

BIG ALSO: I can absolutely wait until Black Friday sales. I am in no rush."
7434,"Hi, I recommend looking at my [gaming laptop list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/) instead of my general use laptop list. The Gigabyte Aorus 15P on my list, which happens to be on sale, is a decent choice. It has an RTX 3060 115W, which is not the highest wattage, but is still on the high side."
7435,"Hi, I'll be moving to the USA in early January next year (I'll be buying the laptop around then) and I'm looking for a laptop around $1300. I've been thinking about the legion 5 pro but have heard bad things about its build quality and battery life is there anything with similar specs which is objectively better?"
7436,"Hi, it is very hard to predicate what the market is going to look like in a few months, so it is hard to give a good suggestion right now. I would wait and see what deals are available later. The Legion 5 Pro is definitely a good choice if you can find it in stock. The battery life isn't great, but the build quality is reasonable for the price point in my opinion."
7437,thank you ill come back in a few months asking the same question if you dont mind :)
7438,"Hello, first of all thank you for your encyclopedic knowledge and suggestions!

I have an Asus Rog Strix GL502VT and have loved it for 5 years. This baby is starting to fail unfortunately but I know all good things must come to an end... Nevertheless, I am looking for a good upgrade. Looking for something that can play modern games and can also run engineering softwares (Ansys, SoldiWorks, Catia and more). Budget is equal/less than $3k, battery life is not too important, backpack life is king. 

Merci beaucoup!"
7439,"Hi, I recommend you look at my [gaming laptop list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/). I would recommend the Eluktronics MAX-15 on my list, since it is fairly light but doesn't sacrifice performance. Given your budget, I would up to the RTX 3080 configuration with a Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU, which would be excellent for your uses."

7442,"Looking for something good for some gaming (preferably something capable of handling ray tracing, so it doesn‚Äôt need replacement soon) that will also be good for programming. Would like a touch screen, mostly because I‚Äôve never had one.

Battery life and durability are more important than weight.

Not sure what the price range on something like that is. Would like to keep it under $1.5k but my budget is flexible."
7443,"Hi, unfortunately, powerful devices with touchscreens are very rare. I would go for the Acer Swift X on my list. It offers a solid balance between performance and battery life, which is rare for the price point."
7444,"I‚Äôm looking for a laptop that can be ‚Äúdecent‚Äù at gaming (FFXIV/Dota) but also can serve well for tabletop RPGs with a touch screen for notes and interactivity.

Budget maxes around 1750 unless a spectacular feature set. Tend toward battery at least in the 6 hour range & weight is not an extreme concern. Am I hunting a unicorn?"
7445,"Hi, although it isn't on my list, the [**ASUS ROG Flow X13**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/203600437712?hash=item2f678821d0:g:iQAAAOSwFMBhO57i&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5338636961&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1) is what you're looking for. It is a 2-in-1 gaming capable device. You get a 8-core Ryzen 9 5900HS processor, RTX 3050 Ti graphics, 16 GB RAM, a 1 TB SSD, and a FHD+ 13.4"" 120Hz IPS touch display. It should be great for general use and games at med-high settings 1080p."

My budget is around 1500 usd give or take some 

Thanks so much"
7449,"Hi, if weight matters a lot, go for the Acer Swift X on my list. It offers a great balance between performance, battery life, and weight. It should be solid for games at med-high settings 1080p and general use."
