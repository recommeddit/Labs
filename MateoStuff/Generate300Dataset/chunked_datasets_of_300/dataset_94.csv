30040,"From your replies it seems you are making an app? Please do share it here when it's already available.

PS. A lot of us here love spreadsheets as you can see,  so biggest dealbreaker would be if the data cannot be exported (for free). For me I only want an app for recording expenses on the go, and to filter previous records easily (the only real con of spreadsheets is that they are unwieldy and look ugly on mobile)."
30041,"Yup I'm making an app, originally yung mga feature ng app is from my needs, then pinapagamit ko sa mga kakilala ko, so mga feature requests nila ang nilalagay ko. Kaya nag post ako para magkaron ako ng idea kung anung features ang mga hinahanapng tao"
30042,"when I graduated 7 years ago, plano ko din sana yan, basing on my more than four years experience of manually listing down my expenses , and formally studying on an accountancy course for a semester. Though it didn't go that route ..."
30043,Well it's never too late to start naman
30044,"Yep, now that I'm (voluntarily) unemployed , I'm thinking about it. Though I am more on (re-)learning Drupal (8) & PHP (7) and improving on (COBOL-like*) programming language I've used for some time now.

30045,Good old MS Excel!
30046,"1SecMoney for ios. 

Pros:

\- Multiple accounts, 

\- multiple budget per category weekly/monthly etc

\- may diff account for diff currency(useful) pag nag oout of country. 

\- Auto backup

\- Maganda yung reports, may hashtagging system and @ system

\- Quickly log from widget

Cons:

\- Walang auto connect sa bank/credit card. So I need to do this manually.

\- Wala ding taking photo receipt"
30047,"taking photo of receipt looks like a nice feature, mukang kailangan ko idagdag to sakin. anyway, saan nagstore yung auto backup feature nila?"
30048,"Sa icloud yung auto backup, then pwede rin manual export with CSV format.

Yeah, if deal breaker sayo yung photo taking, wala siya nun haha."
30049,"Gamit ko toshl (free)

Ok ung category and tag system. Maganda ung filters for reporting. May budget at reoccuring expense feature din. Pwede export sa csv kapag free at may monthly reports. Eventually, i recommend get the plus version kasi unli accounts. 2 lang ang pwede sa free."
30050,"I tried this and decided to go back to spreadsheet (LibreOffice) on which I can input everything which is not complicated for a single person’s expenses. 

But if you prefer an app, can’t go wrong with toshl."
30051,"Spendee.  
Pros: Easy to understad and navigate.  
Cons: One budget lang ang pwede."
30052,"Spreadsheets for life! 

Apps got nothing on my banigs hahaha"
30053,Money lover and Splitwise
30054,"I use Wallet by BudgetBakers. 

Pros:

\- You can add up to three accounts (ex: cash on-hand, money in the bank, money in your coin bank). 

\- Has labels in your income and expenses so you can track specific income and expenses (ex: food and drinks, transportation)

\- Has a pie chart of the breakdown of your income and expenses according to the labels you set

\- Gives you a rough percentage of the change in your spending. For example, the graph shows ""-21%"" in red font when your expenses for the last 7 days went down by 21%

\- Has options where you can set a goal

\- Helps you track planned payments

\- Helps you track your debts and money people loaned from you

\- Has a feature where you rate whether a certain expense is ""worth it"" or ""not worth it""

Cons:

\- You have to pay for certain features like if you want to add more accounts or sync a certain account to your bank. You also need to upgrade to premium if you want to change the colors of labels, etc. (di naman sobrang laking con, pero ayun may limitations kung hindi premium). 

\- Not really good for tracking expenses in your business. App is mostly for personal and family budget"
30055,Nice! Any feedback on its auto-connection with your bank savings account?
30056,"I tried connecting BDO and BPI. A bit shady because it asks for your online banking credentials - but I don't expect local banks to be that advanced tech-wise. It says it only has read-only access to your bank account. I have transactions protected by OTP anyway so it's safe.

It synced all of my transactions and auto-categorized them! The auto-categorisation is not very accurate though, but they say it improves / learns with use, so it uses machine learning (?).

It categorised withdrawals as expenses at first though - should be transfers to cash.  


Edit: I messed up. I was talking about Spendee. 😂"
30057,">\- Has labels in your income and expenses so you can track specific income and expenses (ex: food and drinks, transportation)

so meron syang parang categories?, so yung isang expense pwedeng multiple labels?"
30058,"In the app, category and labels are separate. A record can only have one category. It can have many labels though"
30059,"aaah okay, mukang useful si labels sa mga graphs and reportings, i'll add that feature to my app. pati na din yung receipt photo :)"
30060,"GnuCash - It's for PC only and it's free. there's a bit of a learning curve, pero it can do anything Quicken can

&#x200B;

Pros - Free, feature-rich, pwede for personal/business, pwede for stocks. open-source, sobrang useful sakin ng budgets and monthly reports

&#x200B;

Cons - Learning curve, di pwede sa phone"
30061,"I only used it once around five years ago, na-hassle ako hindi ko na ulit binuksan. Sa excel na lang ako hahaha."

30064,I developed my own simple Android app where I log all my daily expenses and extract the data for a weekly report.
30066,"I second Wallet! Its free tier is just unmatched by any other free tier of any other personal finance app. Up to three accounts, inviting UI, and almost set and forget if you set up your planned payments right. :)"

it's fairly decent - a little clunky in reporting and looking back on stuff.

30097,"Will Fowler's *Santa Anna of Mexico* is by far the best English-language biography. For a good history of the Mexican-American War that gives a lot more attention to the Mexican side than most others, Peter Guardino's ""The Dead March"" is by far the best for that. I worked with Dr. Guardino on my Master's thesis, which was about the Mexican-American War.

John S.D. Eisenhower's ""So Far From God"" and K. Jack Bauer's ""The Mexican War"" are good military histories, but are of course Americentric. Most of the books covering the Mexican side of the war are, sadly for you perhaps, in Spanish."
30098,"Hi!

30099,"I don’t know if it fits what you want exactly, but The Eagle and The Raven by James Michener follows the path of Sam Houston and Santa Anna, past the Texas Revolution.  A very quick and easy read"
30100,"The Dead March by Peter Guardino. It came out last year and is consider a “New Military History” meaning it is not so much about campaigns and commanders as it is about the social constructs of both Mexico and the United States. Why did the US win? Why did Mexico lose? How do race, gender, class, nationalism effect soldier and citizen?"
30101,"We mostly focus on the issue of not annexing Texas sooner because they were in the south and would’ve been a “slave state” upsetting the balance of power in the country at the time. They highlight the movement of troops closer to the border to lure Mexico into firing the first shot, but also focus on the repeated requests by Texas to join the Union being a major factor in finally taking action. We also focus on the refusal of Mexico to enter peace negotiations due to the political attitudes of certain members of the government. But overall it’s shown as the match that sparked the American civil war. It’s not focused on as heavily as other conflicts like the French and Indian war, the revolution, or the civil war."
30102,We focus on it pretty heavily during our whole “Expansion/Manifest Destiny” unit.
30103,I’m 43 and didn’t know there was a Mexican American war.
30104,"WHAT?!
What state did you grow up in? We focus on it pretty heavily in CA because it’s a big part of our history. Even though it’s US history, it’s not as integral to every state’s history so it may not have been focused on."
30105,I only remember it because I remembered the Alamo.
30106,"You do realize that was a different war that happened almost 10 years earlier, don’t you?"
30107,I did not know there was a Mexican America war either. I’m from a northern/Midwestern state so further from the border. We likely touched on it briefly in elementary and/or middle school but it was not a very significant portion of our history lessons
30108,I’m from the Midwest and know about it only because my dad is a history buff. I don’t think we ever learned about it in school
30109,Was the French and Indian war as consequential as the Mexican American?
30110,"After the French and Indian War, England started taxing the colonies (without representation) to help pay off the debts that arose from it, and we all know what that led to."
30111,It was also the broader war that was a big part of shifting things in Europe to set up the latter 18th and 19th century power struggles.
30112,This.  The French and Indian War was just one theater of the Seven Years War
30113,World War 1: The Prequel
30114,French and Indian Wars- the Thirty Years War Sequel (ignoring a myriad of similar conflicts in between)
30115,"Afterwards England also forbid settlement West of the Appalachian mountains to reserve it for native people, which upset colonists (even though they ignored it mostly)"
30116,Yeah I was confused for a bit when you were talking about the French and Indian war cus I couldn't think of a time when the U.S. and France went to war but then I realized you were talking about the 7 Years War lol
30117,Yeah it’s part of it. As someone else commented above the French and Indian war was a theatre of the larger Seven Years War. Though I believe the French and Indian War was a little longer. And it was France and England (US wasn’t a country yet).
30118,"In the US it's called the French and Indian war because from an American history perspective, it was a war where we (British colonials) fought French and 1st Nations people.

I was aware it was one part of a broader global war (7 Years War), but I couldn't tell you a single thing about the 7 Years War.

For reference, I graduated top of my class from one of the biggest high schools in the country, double majored at a top university, graduated in the top 1 or 5% (I can't remember) there, went to graduate school, and have a doctorate. I know fuckall about that war.

That is how little the US prioritizes history beyond our borders: objectively speaking I am top 1% educational outcome for this country and I don't know that. (FWIW none of my degrees were a history degree.)"
30119,"The French and Indian war is seen by many as the single event in history that led to the founding of the United States of America. It put a huge financial burden on England, who then attempted to make up that deficit by taxing the living hell out of the colonies. When they got sick of paying for england’s debt and announced their independence, England tried to send the military in to control them. That... didn’t end well for them."
30120,"More so. A French victory in that war would have meant no American Revolution and no USA, although we can speculate that given the larger number of American colonists than French in North America, it's likely the colonies would have eventually won their independence from the French, but everything would have been different."
30121,"Very, it was the match that lot the fuse to the American Revolution, and besides that,heavily influenced the geopolitical/cultural boundaries of the U.S and Canada, even to this day."
30122,"Honestly, even the French/Indian war gets glossed over as a step that lead to the revolution.   It’s mainly the reason my our constitution lays out things like we can’t be forced to give up our homes so soldiers can stay in them.  (Grossly oversimplified explanation I know).  Plus the whole taxation without representation thing."
30123,Grant said in his autobiography that the Mexican War made the Civil War inevitable. He viewed it as a disgraceful instance of bullying and felt we Americans ultimately reaped what we had sown.
30124,"We did a big unit on the Mexican American war, and the Texas revolution. Other major units were the American revolution, the civil war, and the two world wars. We however never learned about the French Indian war. I know it happened and that it was called the 7 years war even tho it wasn’t seven years long, that’s about it."
30125,"We still covered it, they just didn’t emphasize the importance of that war nearly as much as the others. When we did discuss it, our teachers focused more on the geopolitical implications regarding the civil war than anything else. It was approached kind of like, “so this thing happened, and that’s how we got Texas and a good chunk of the southwest. But because of that, here’s all the bullshit it caused in our own government!”"
30126,"Not for me, I don’t know where you live but we mostly focused on the timeline of events, the causes, and then the effects. All pretty equally, not just the effects. Also the only effects we really learned was the things in the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo."
30127,"To be honest, for the time, it was a perfectly unremarkable war of conquest. They were not rare at the time and were kind of just how things were done. That does over simplify things a bit, but at the end of the day the US saw a clear path to securing possibly the best geographical position that a country could ever ask for and decided it would be a damn fool move to not take advantage of the situation."
30128,"It was quite controversial at the time. A lot of anti-Slavery Northerners thought that it was a phony, pretextual war that was based on a lie and perpetrated for the benefit of the slave states."
30129,"Yeah, it wasn’t an unusual war for the time, but it was controversial. Grant wrote in his memoir “For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.”"
30130,"This quote by him doesn't get enough circulation: 

""“With a soldier the flag is paramount . . . I know the struggle with my conscience during the Mexican War. I have never altogether forgiven myself for going into that. I had very strong opinions on the subject. I do not think there was ever a more wicked war than that waged by the United States on Mexico. I thought so at the time, when I was a youngster, only I had not moral courage enough to resign. I had taken an oath to serve eight years, unless sooner discharged, and I considered my supreme duty was to my flag. I had a horror of the Mexican War, and I have always believed that it was on our part most unjust. The wickedness was not in the way our soldiers conducted it, but in the conduct of our government in declaring war. The troops behaved well in Mexico, and the government acted handsomely about the peace. We had no claim on Mexico. Texas had no claim beyond the Nueces River, and yet we pushed on to the Rio Grande and crossed it. I am always ashamed of my country when I think of that invasion.”

~ Ulysses S. Grant to journalist John Russell Young (1879), quoted by Young in Around the World with General Grant (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2002), 376-377"""
30131,"I believe Lincoln, as a 1st term congressman, earned his stripe on opposing the war, but I may be wrong on that."
30132,"That's correct, https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/5495#:~:text=On%20January%2012%2C%201848%20Abraham,the%20%E2%80%9CSpot%20Resolutions%E2%80%9D%20that%20asked"
30133,That’s good? Because in the last one he started out a Captain and ended a Private.
30134,"When you serve a country, you follow orders, not negotiate politics. Also, the goal of war is to end the war. It's not cut and dry. Like, we don't continue battling after the war is over."
30135,This is how it was taught in college for me. Polk said “I want that land.” Then he went and got it.
30136,"This isn't how I learned it in my middle and high school. We learned that is was a brazen act of imperialism and we basically just stole Mexico's land because we could. I also learned there were a lot of opponents to this act. I believe Lincoln and Henry Thoreau are the two I remember specifically. I was taught it within the context of Manifest Destiny and our general western expansion. I'm 21 and from the Denver Metro area, so take that for what you will."
30137,"This is just rephrasing what he said in different words, surely. Perfectly normal stuff by 19th century standards."
30138,"I always thought the whole ""stealing"" aspect was a really odd take...generally the venn diagram that is ""The US stole the land from Mexico"" and ""imperialism is a massive crime against humanity"" is basically a circle yet for some reason going imperial on a land that another country already went imperial on is somehow worse."
30139,Yeah I agree with this. I’m reading *What Hath God Wrought* which is a very detailed historical text which covers 1815-1845 and I really have a hard time feeling sympathetic to one imperial power when another comes and does the same thing to it that it had been doing to everyone else.
30140,"I don’t know if calling this Imperialism makes sense in this context. All of the occupied territories were fringe territories of Mexico, with *extremely* few Mexicans actually living there.

I think it’s fair to call this imperialism with respect to the natives living there, but I don’t really see how Mexico would have the moral high ground since they (really Spain) basically did the same thing: just decided that this territory all belonged to them—not because their people lived there—but because they wanted the land. The effect of the war on most of the people living in those areas was to swap out one imperial overlord with another."
30141,"That's not how it was taught in SoCal in the 90s. It was just taught as a fairly regular war of conquest. Usually as a component on Manifest Destiny and all the atrocities America committed in those goals, but it itself wasn't particularly heinous."
30145,I mean we gained a huge amount of land including what is now our most populous state and an economic power house so I’d say it was pretty remarkable
30143,Basically the overall takeaway was that we didnt consider the Mexicans much- the entire thing was a bargaining chip between the North and South against the backdrop of slavery rights
30144,"Not really, no, it was a bit more complicated than that. There were a lot of things happening within the Mexican government that are kind of ignored in the teaching of the conflict up here apparently. Half a dozen Mexican states seceded from the Mexican Republic, not just Texas, and not just states that were aligned with the United States. The war likely would not have happened, at least not in the way that it did, without the coup that dissolved the Second Mexican Republic, tossed the Mexican federal constitution, and centralized power around the central government and a single dictator, Santa Anna. Essentially what you were seeing was a democracy failing and it's constituent states deciding that they did not want to be part of a country that had just turned into a military dictatorship.  
  
Seriously, people really need to read more about what kind of state Mexico was in at the time. If I was a Mexican or Texan or whatever, I would want out too. It was basically like 4 decades of instability after the Mexicans gained independence. The whole country's ability to rules itself was constantly in question and they couldn't keep a constitution around long enough to read the damn thing. It was a mess, but Santa Anna is the one who fired the first bullet when he led a coup.
  
So it was a war of conquest, but it was also kind of a war of opportunity. It was just perfect timing. I mean, it was the early 1800's you don't get to be a failed state on the border of a stronger country. Not unless you have strong allies willing to protect you."
30146,"My vague memory is that my school textbooks did describe the reasons for the war being shady and unethical.  But the actual conduct of the war was 'honorable' -- the US Army soundly defeated the Mexicans with solid strategy, superior tactics and equipment etc.  (General Grant in his memoirs described the Mexican Army as woefully underprepared for war in the 1840s but was much improved at the end of Grant's life (1880s)."
30147,"The U.S Army was definitely well prepared for the war - it was woefully unprepared for the War of 1812 and suffered greatly as a result for the first two years of the war, but came out of it as a highly effective and professional force, and went into Mexico as one thirty years later."
30148,"In my part of the country it is taught mainly as something that contributed to the Civil War:

1. We learned that the abolitionists and early Republicans opposed the war, seeing it as an illegitimate effort to expand slavery.
2. We read [Civil Disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_(Thoreau)) by Thoreau and learned about his argument that Americans should refuse to pay taxes because the taxes were being used to fund a dishonorable invasion of a neighboring country, designed to spread slavery
3. We learned that Abraham Lincoln gained national prominence through the [Spot Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions), which attempted to prevent the invasion of Mexico
4. We learned that after the war, the slave states were outraged by abolitionists' efforts to prevent slavery in the territory taken from Mexico. The slave states saw expanded slavery as their fair reward for supporting the invasion. We learned that this was a major cause of the confederate states leaving the Union
5. During the Civil War, the military commanders on both sides had served together in the Mexican-American war. They applied lessons from that war against each other"
30149,"In Texas, all students are required to take Texas History in 7th Grade (we don’t take American History until 8th Grade).

Most of our attention went to the Texas Revolution itself, which, obviously, preceded the Mexican-American War.  We were taught that Texas was a Mexican state populated by a lot of Tejanos and American Immigrants.  Mexico required all immigrants to be Catholic.  Most American Immigrants were Protestant, so a Mexican citizen named Stephen F. Austin found a loophole that used the term “Catholic” to mean “Christian” instead of “Roman Catholic,” and a bunch of Americans moved in. Many of them brought their slaves with them.

Then Santa Ana seized power in Mexico City and tore up the Constitution of 1824, which took away a *ton* of civil rights from the people and essentially made himself Dictator-for-Life.  It also had the effect of outlawing slavery.  

So it didn’t matter if you were a Tejano, a slave-owning Tejano, a Roman Catholic, a Protestant, an American Immigrant or an American Immigrant with slaves; they were equally *all* fucked. 

Unsurprisingly, several Mexican states *in addition to* Texas revolted.  Santa Ana brutally suppressed the other rebelling Mexican states first, and then turned northward to Texas. 

Then you had Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto.  Presto-Changeo, Santa Ana traded his life for an Independent Texan Nation. 

But the Texans didn’t *want* to be independent. They wanted to become a part of the United States right from the start.  It’s just that the US was already struggling with the Free-State/Slave-State issue, and a slave-holding Texas complicated things. So the US said, “Naw - don’t call us, we’ll call you.”

About a decade goes by and Santa Ana, very much regretting signing away Texas by now, starts challenging the southern border of the newly-independent nation, claiming that it ended at the Nueces River, instead of the Rio Grande River, about a 100 miles south.  

By this point, the US just happens to have a workable entry plan for several territories, but they needed another slave state to make the deal work. 

So the US calls up Texas: “Yo, I think we can make room for you now.” Texas says: “Ah, I’d love to.  But we got a fuck-ton of debt we weren’t expecting to accumulate, because *someone* wouldn’t let us in their club - *I’m looking at you, Sam!*. We also got that fuckwad from the south threatening to invade us again, and using the border dispute as a *causus belli*. “

US says, “Oh.” 

Texas: “So what are you going to do about *that*?”

US: “I mean, I guess we could invade and...ah, save you from tyranny or something like that.” 

Texas: [Rolls eyes] “*Finally*”

US: “Will it mean that we have to actually *conquer* Mexico, because, we...ah...we *really* don’t wanna do that.” 

Texas: “How the fuck should *I* know? You’re the one with the army.  You tell *me*.”

US: [Sighs]. “Okay.  Some of the guys really aren’t gonna like that.  But...*[checks pending territorial deal]* I guess if we’re going to make this deal work any time soon, I reckon we don’t have much of a choice.”

Texas: “Yeah. Whatever. Just get your ass to Kinney’s Trading Post on the Nueces River.  We’ll meet you there.” *[Hangs up phone].*

US: *[Stares at phone in astonished disgust].* “Fuck.”

US makes a half-assed attempt to resolve the situation diplomatically.  Mexico makes a full-assed attempt to tell the US that they and their deal can fuck right off. 

US shows up in Texas and marches to Mexico City in an effort to end the war. This followed  the by-the-numbers European warfare strategy of “Capture the Capital, End the War.”  

Mexico puts up a fight.  Santa Ana is more effective than people thought, but is still ultimately overwhelmed by superior American numbers, weapons, and training.  

Santa Ana takes off, leaving Mexico with broken coffers and a legacy of socio-political problems;  some of which plague that country to this very day.  

US gets their slave state, and their territory deal finally goes through.  

Less than 20 years later, a bloody civil war begins. 

The End."
30150,"Yup. One thing I find interesting is slavery's role in the Texas Revolution is what people think slavery's role in the Civil War was. 

Texas would've revolted over violations of the Constitution of 1824 with or without slavery, though it was definitely a motivator for some. The Civil War doesn't happen without slavery at its core."
30151,"Yep.  Slavery was definitely a part of the equation.  But as you point out, it was only *a part* of the impetus to rebel.  It wasn’t even the primary reason, like it was later in the American Civil War. 

Not *every* American Immigrant in Texas owned slaves.  And even fewer Tejanos did.  It was mostly like: “WTF? You’re taking away our right to free speech...*so you can issue your own laws and be President-for-Life?*”

*Anyone* would have rebelled; slaves or no slaves.  

And several Mexican states did.  Unfortunately for some of the rebels on the Yucatán Peninsula, Santa Ana was particularly brutal.  And he intentionally made it painful for them - many of whom were indigenous people.  He wanted to make a statement that he was in charge.  

Texians were rightly terrified about what was going to happen to them when he turned his forces northward.  And as it turns out, they were right about him at the Alamo.

I see on Reddit a lot of people making the mistake in assuming Santa Ana was fighting in Texas to stop slavery.  Maybe.  Maybe a *little* bit; although I haven’t seen any credible evidence for this claim.

Mostly he was there for some serious dick-waving to show Mexico - and the rest of the world - that he had an inescapably iron grip on the throat of his country."
30152,"And he might have gotten away with it had his officers been more competent. He was no Napoleon, but he wasn't a bad general."
30153,"Well, I think he had some pretty good generals. 

But many of them fucking *hated* Santa Ana.  He was an asshole.  Like an epic-level asshole. He humiliated whenever he had a chance, and was careless in the expenditure of his troops’ lives.  

This pissed off a lot of them.  It’s no wonder they only half-heartedly fought for him.  And when he took off, they wasted no time writing a bunch of really bad shit about Santa Ana - a lot of it was just malarkey to make him look bad.  

But Santa Ana was guy who used to brag and brag about how he made his own troops suffer; and there was plenty of evidence to believe *that*. 

It just goes to show you: being a good military leader isn’t just about understanding strategy and tactics.  It’s also about being a good listener and treating your troops well...or at least not treat them as “so many chickens” as he was purported to have said in a room full of his generals.  

If it weren’t for the fact that the guy pussed out and signed over Texas in exchange for his life, bankrupted the Mexican treasury, and set off two centuries of socio-political instability, he’d probably be remembered for being a pretty good general.  

But Santa Ana just could get past being “Santa Ana.”"
30154,"My family thinks we're related to Martín Perfecto de Cos...and by extension, Santa Anna by marriage 😂"
30155,"Martin Perfecto de Cos was probably - in my humble opinion, at least - Santa Ana’s best general, and his writings about Santa Ana are - also in my opinion - the most credible.  He was a very practical and very capable general. 

He often offered some very sensible precautions in their military campaign - but Santa Ana usually just blew him off, because he thought his own judgment was more or less infallible. 

Mexico would have been *far* better off if de Cos had been in charge of the Mexican Army back then.  Santa Ana was bold and took a lot of chances most generals wouldn’t have. 

It’s just that you don’t really *need* to be incautious and daring against a bunch of poorly-armed, poorly-trained rebels.  De Cos would have rolled right into Texas and quickly flattened the rebellion with no muss and no fuss - just like he did the *first* time Mexico City sent troops there.  Sometimes, taking a simple tactical approach to some situations is best. 

But Santa Ana wanted the “tough guy” image, and just got overly-confident in his own approach. 

And it cost Mexico a huge chunk of its northern boundaries."
30156,"That's the one thing that really baffles me about the Texas Revolution. I'm just as proud of my heritage as the next Texan, but like, *how did Mexico not just steamroll the Texians?* Mexico had us out-manned and out-gunned, Mexico had professional soldiers and we had rebellious farmers, led by frontiersmen, directed by a general who no one wanted to listen to. This *should* have been a cakewalk for Mexico"
30157,"Because Santa Ana just “Santa Ana’d.”  

If he had listened to his generals, or at least been a little less of an arrogant asshat, he *would* have steam-rolled over the Texians. 

But he felt he knew best, and made a ton of stupid decisions while fighting the rebels.  

He was also more accustomed to the rebellions in Mexicans states in southern part of Mexico.  Those rebellions weren’t very well organized, and *way* more poorly armed than the Texians were.  

My *cat* could have probably led the Mexicans to victory in those states.   

Texians, on the other hand, were better armed, had some combat experience, and were comparatively well-organized.  

Santa Ana could have still crushed the Texians, of course.  But he picked a lot of tactics that he thought were “cute” but not very sound in the situation he was in."
30158,"Adding on to what bosworth said alot of it has to due with the motives. Texans were fighting tooth and nail against a tyrannical empire (sound familiar) while the mexican side hated their own leader as much as the texans did. Generally in independence wars, the side thats more stubborn and fighting for the more idealistic of causes tends to win."
30159,"While Santa Ana was holed up for thirteen days at San Antonio, Sam Houston was busy turning the eastern half of Texas into Russia.  He took what supplies he could and burned what he couldn't.

On itsmarch east, Santa Ana's massive army couldn't supply itself effectively.  When they got to Lynchburg they were on their last legs, which is when Sam Houston struck, routing the Mexican army and capturing Santa Ana"
30160,So the takeaway from this story is that this Santa Anna dude was pretty bad.
30161,"A lot of historians think so; Mexican *and* American historians. 

I think he probably really cared about Mexico.  Or at least he cared about Mexico’s greatness. 

The problem was, he appeared to believe that his *own* greatness was tied to his *country’s* greatness.  If he was “great,” then his country would be too. It’s not a good formula for leadership.

But his ego was just insufferable.  And so was his cynical indifference.  He spent *enormous* amounts of Mexico’s treasury on lavish dinner parties and balls in order to make himself appear more important.  He was disdainful to just about everyone around him, and thought of the average citizen more like inconsequential peasants than fellow countrymen.  He didn’t even pretend to care about them.

He was just one of those guys who *could* have been great.  But he just kept getting in his own way."
30162,I need more of these Dramatic Phonecalls of History kind of stories
30163,"Damn, are you a history teacher? I vaguely remembered that Texas was part of Mexico at some point"
30164,"Grew up in Texas, and this is kind of how I remember it being taught. 

It was mostly a weird footnote to ""we fought against Mexico for our independence.  They didn't agree that we won and we eventually joined the United States and settled it for good."" 

I never really realized why Mexico still felt they had a claim to Texas until I was around 30 and did a little research.  I get it, it would be kind of like if Washington state seceded and while we were still arguing about whether or not that was really a thing, they suddenly said ""haha, we're Canadians now!""  

A hundred years later you'd still kind of feel like you got robbed somehow and those people are still sorta US citizens."
30165,"Yep.  

Although keep in mind that there wouldn’t have been a conversation at all about Texas if Santa Ana hadn’t signed it over to escape imprisonment/execution. 

A lot of Santa Ana’s contemporaries (in their private papers) considered it an act of selfish cowardice, and resented him for it.

Me? “Gimme yer country or yer life, pal.” I’m like: “Sure.  Where do I sign?”

But Mexico back then was a very different culture.  The cultural expectation was for Santa Ana to say he’d never sign away Texas and take whatever execution or torture was in store for him. 

I often wondered what would have happened if Santa Ana had been martyred as a Mexican hero, instead of agreeing to an independent Texas."
30166,I teach it in middle school more briefly in Colorado and I teach it a lot like this.
30167,The biggest discovery here is that presto-changeo is more than a magic word
30168,"Stephen F. Austin wasn't a citizen of Mexico, he was an American. He went to online community college but dropped out and got his real estate license from his dad when he died"
30169,"That's pretty much how I remember it. Kudos on still remembering on all the details. My school district actually taught Texas history in 4th grade and then American history in 5th grade. Then relearned it all, again, in the same grades you mentioned. No matter what region of Texas you're in, Texas will be taught 1st🤣"
30170,"> (we don’t take American History until 8th Grade)

WHAT?!"
30171,"You had “social studies” in elementary school, which talks a little bit about history in general.  But it’s not extensive.  It teaches a little bit of geography.  For history, elementary kids learn mostly just hits, like the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, Columbus, the American Revolution, and the Civil War.  Maybe a little about the 20th Century stuff like WWI and WWII - but not much.

Starting in middle school, you start having more directed and extensive studies. In 7th Grade, you take Texas History. In 8th Grade, American History to 1877.  In 9th Grade, American History 1877 to present. In 11th Grade, you take World History.  

In your senior year, you would take Government (Civics) instead of a history class. 

And of course, there were a few honors history courses available to some students if they wanted it. 

But yes: we learned Texas History before we learned US History."
30172,"yeah I think 6th was World History, 7th was Texas, and 8th was American. I can't remember high school, but I'm 100% sure I had AP American History in 11th or 12th grade. Eurpean History was an elective in high school (we were on a schedule very much like universities: a class was a semester long and an hour and a half-ish. So you did 4 classes a semester, and it was theoretically possible to take 8 courses in sequence. I did Algebra 2 -> Geometry -> Trig -> Pre-Calc -> Calc AB -> Calc BC in three years and my senior year didn't take any math at all. Then, after a year-long break, I majored in math and remarkably remembered it all :)"
30173,"It's mentioned, but not dwelled on much.  It comes up in High School US history classes, but it's not a major topic, at least in Kentucky.

It's taught as two things:

1. A squabble with Mexico over borders and territory that helped expand the US westward.

2. A precursor to the US Civil War, as many of the major leaders of the Civil War were veterans of the Mexican War and first saw combat there."
30174,"I honestly don't remember learning about it. Which is surprising because Texas produces a huge percentage of US textbooks. My state was experimenting with standardized testing, and so the history curriculum changed each year. Which resulted in me learning about 1492-1864 FIVE TIMES. We were taught reconstruction once, and never actually got to WWI or later. I only took world history once in college (we did an ancient egypt thing in 4th grade but I don't think that really counts).   
To answer your question, we spent a single day talking about ""remembering the Alamo"" and that was about all the context we got. No Spanish American war, no Mexican American war.   
But let me tell you, I can talk about the revolutionary war for hours. They drilled that into us at the expense of everything else.  
(And before you say anything I had a 3.85/4.0 A average when I graduated, 17th out of 300-something so I was actually paying attention in class)"
30175,"The Mexican-American War receives very little attention in American history classes at the primary or university level, and it is not a big part of ""public memory"" in the sense that there aren't many books written about it, monuments made to it, etc. 

These days I think it would normally be taught as a war of conquest. At the time it was extremely controversial and many Northerners in America thought that it was a fake pretext for the South to grab more slave territories. Abe Lincoln's most notable act when he was in Congress was to sponsor an act called the ""Spot Resolution,"" where he demanded an investigation to determine the exact spot where Mexican troops had allegedly fired on American troops. Northerners suspected that the alleged event that triggered the war had been made up by the Polk Administration as a pretext for a land-grab."
30176,">  monuments made to it, etc. 

Depending on if naming something is a monument then there is 10 out of 99 county names in Iowa tied to the war:

* Buena Vista County is named after the [Battle of Buena Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Buena_Vista)

* Cerro Gordo County is named after the [Battle of Cerro Gordo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cerro_Gordo)

* Clay County is named after [Henry Clay Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay_Jr.) an officer in the war killed at the Battle of Buena Vista

* Guthrie County is named after Edwin B. Guthrie, Mexican–American War officer.

* Mills County is named after Frederick Mills, a Major killed during the [Battle of Churubusco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Churubusco)

* Page County is named after John Page who was killed during the [Battle of Palo Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Palo_Alto)

* Palo Alto County is named after the Battle I just mentioned above

* Ringgold County is named after [Samuel Ringgold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Ringgold_(United_States_Army_officer)) who was killed in the war and is considered the ""Father of Modern Artillery.""

* Taylor County is named after Major General [Zachary Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor) and was made before he was President

* Worth County is named after Major General [William Jenkins Worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Worth) who fought in the war."
30177,"In Texas, we were taught that it was partially to ""save"" Texas. Texas just won its independence, but Mexico didn't accept it. The US comes to save the day while trying to annex Texas into the union (and then take some more land when it came to a peace treaty). In my college history classes, they were more blunt about it being an act of ""manifest destiny"" where the US saw everything West of its borders as inherently theirs and the Mexican-American War was a result of that. There was also a growing issue around slavery and southern states knew they could add Texas as a slave state, along with possibly more slave states with the additional land."
30178,"""Yeah we really screwed the Mexicans over, but what else is new? We were determined to get the land one way or another. When we asked and they refused, we stopped asking. Then we won, the end"""
30179,"The war is seen as America very much being the aggressor.  At the time Senator Abraham Lincoln called out James K Polk for having soldiers cross the border and intentionally getting Mexican soldiers to fire on them to start a conflict.  Known as the [Spot Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions).  The entire war and it's battles weren't discussed much besides the capture of Mexico City.  The war is also seen as a precursor event to the Civil War as a lot of soldiers and military leaders get experience from this was that helps them in the Civil War. Plus slavery and conquest comes up, northern states and southern states didn't want to take over much of Mexican due to one racism and two cause no one wanted any more states that allowed or disallowed slavery."
30180,"In the U.S. history book, I recall, we learn briefly of the Texas Independence as a division of the mostly English speaking protestants unable to buy land unless they became Catholic, a general cultural clash. The Alamo and the Goliad massacre were mentioned as well as the victory at the Battle of San Jacinto by Sam Houston.

For the Mexican-American war, it was Manifest Destiny. In this case we were the aggressors that baited Mexican troops in a grey Texas border area that helped spark the war. From there we had the landings at Vera Cruz, the march to Mexico City and its quick capitulation. A lot of the people fought in the war became important military people in the American Civil War. Then debate came up of the possibility of taking all of Mexico, but ended up taking a third because they didn't want all the Spanish speaking Catholics.

Finally the Gadsden Purchase, which was purchased from Mexico to help build a southern rail route to the west. Its purchase was more than what the United States gave to Mexico for the land ceded from the Mexican-American War and was only possible because the Mexican government was is horrific debt from the war.

While that sounds like a lot, class discussion was only 2-3 days at most before moving on to the American Civil War, where that would take over a month discussion. Basically, touched on the highlights in class and read the chapters at home, which most people did not do."
30181,"It’s been a long time since I was in elementary or secondary school, but I don’t recall learning much about the Mexican-American War. I think that’s probably in large part because the Civil War sucks up all the air in the room. We spent a lot more time learning about that than other events in the 1800s."
30182,"That it was a war of opportunity to grab up land from a weakened state and we used Texas as a catalyst to start the conflict and bait Mexico into attacking first so Polk didn’t seem like a conqueror.

That’s roughly what I remember."
30183,"The Mexican-American War has somewhat of a mixed reputation. On the one hand it's a pretty patriotic war as you had the Alamo, manifest destiny, and such. On the other hand (as others have pointed out) that the issue of slavery was present during this war. You had some leader's of congress propose there be no expansion of slavery to the territories acquired through the war with Mexico (Wilmont Proviso). Others objected to this war on it being a war of imperial conquest and some like Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience against the prosecution of the conflict. Also many consider the way that James K. Polk's efforts to deescalate the situation with Mexico as disingenuous as seen in the unreasonable demands carried by Slidell who was sent to negotiate on where the border with Mexico should be. This sort of expansionist attitude is seen to have continued under president Franklin Pierce when he tried to annex Cuba and other Carribran, central, and south american territories for the sake of creating more slave states.

In addition to this the Mexican-American War is seen as a training ground for future leader's of the American Civil War. Men such as Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and US Grant served in the conflict and had an impact on their role in the future war.

Basically this war has a pretty mixed reputation but tends to lean towards it being somewhat negative depending on who you ask. I will say that for the most part I personally do not think that we are sorry that we acquired the lands that we did though (Santa Anna was a chump, Mexico was a corrupt country run by Caudillos, etc.). Should we have fought this war-perhaps not. But I do not think that we feel sorry enough to give the land acquired back to Mexico."
30184,"Texas became independent and than wanted to join the US.  This became mired in issues over slavery.  In the closing days of the Fillmore administration, annexation was approved.

Polk became president in 1845.  He ran on an expansionist platform.  He did settle peacefully the Oregon territory border.  Initially, there was an attempt to buy some territory from Mexico but it failed.  Upon annexation of Texas, the US inherited a disputed border.  Texas said it was the Rio Grande and Mexico, the Nueces River.  Polk put troops in the disputed lands to see if Mexico would attack and they did.  Polk used the event to declare war on Mexico.

The actual war wasn't much of a contest.  The US convincinly won.  The US conquered Mexico City by invading via Veracruz.  Back in the US, the war was controversial.  Some tried to pass a law banning slavery in any annexed territory.  Polk initially wanted even more territory but the need to end the war had him settle for what is the southwest minus the Gadsen Purchase."
30185,"I had 'California history' in the fourth grade in the mid 1980s.  They didn't say much on it.  Just that the Anglos who started the Bear Flag Republic were heroic rebels and then California was annexed and everything was as it ought to be.  They even showed us a movie that portrayed as much.

They also glossed over what happened to the California Indians and gave a rosy picture of the Missions.  That was pretty typical for the time, and I presume it was all the more so for previous generations."
30186,You still should have learned about it in high school - the general overview approach is generally enough for most 4th graders
30187,My school never taught about it
30188,"Considering I am from a state which became part of the US because of this war, quite a bit, but still probably not as much as what you would expect. Our entire teaching of the war was framed from the perspective of Westward Expansion and Manifest Destiny, as well as the [California Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Republic)."
30189,"I don't know how its taught today, but when I was in school (the 90's) it wasn't taught. The context of most US wars wasn't given. Instead they focused on how the war affected the US, and for the Mexican American War, it was the increase of territory from Mexico and the annexation of the Republic of Texas."
30190,"In my AP U.S. History class, I remember it being taught in the context of Manifest Destiny and how it contributed to the civil war later by messing up the balance of free and slave states. We talked about many of the generals, battles, and other events like the Bear Flag revolt too."
30191,My memory from learning about in Florida is essentially just “America wanted more land out West so they took it and the Mexicans put up a bad fight.” We didn’t get super in depth past that
30192,It isn’t
30193,"What I remember from school, though I'm sure it wasn't the only thing I was taught, was pointing out all the different military officers and what they did because they were all going to show up in the civil war.

I always thought of the Mexican-American war as one of those precursor wars like the Spanish civil war to world war II"
30194,"At my school, unless you took AP History, you weren't taught about it."
30195,"For me it was “two countries has a dispute over border (Texas). One wanted it here, one wanted it there, they fought, US won. I know this is extremely simplified and I left out a lot of details, but that’s the gist of it"
30196,"While I am sure it was probably mentioned, I don't remember learning a thing about the Mexican American war in school. I don't really remember learning much about any way other than the Revolutionary War in primary and middle school in the early to mid 70's. I graduated high school in 1979 and the 70's are a bit hazy."
30197,"Outside of the SW-- and Texas in particular --it's often not taught at all. I'm a college history professor and the vast majority of my students have never heard of it unless they are from that region. They are more likely to know the Spanish-American war, but all they can tell you about that is ""Remember the Maine!"" and some of them think the state of Maine was somehow attacked by Spain.

High school history in much of the US isn't very substantial and mostly involves objective testing of lists of names/dates with little interpretation or context. Texas of course not only requires state history but has a state-wide textbook mandate; many other states do not so quality varies a lot from district to district. While state standards might even includes lists of events-- like the Mexican-American War --they are often taught as trivia.  AP/IB classes are better of course, but that's not what most people get."
30198,To me it was taught like the Mexicans were being stubborn and wouldn’t agree to the Texas border. And when Texas petitioned to be annexed as a state by the US it pissed off the Mexicans. And then whoever was president sent troops there knowing some would be killed by Mexicans as an excuse to start a war. I think he wanted to start a war in order to obtain more land from the Mexicans our west on top of setting the Texas border at the rio grande. So basically the Mexicans were being stubborn and wouldn’t agree to the Mexican border. Then the Americans went and enforced this and used it as an excuse for the Mexicans to cede us a lot of territory.
30199,"“We heroically stole and colonized more land”, is basically what we’re taught. In America, it’s taught that the Americans were the heroes and the Mexicans were just the pests holding us back from stealing more land"
30200,"Required curricula for Texas, at least. It is not taught in a glorified way these days though not a condemning one either."
30201,"I remember being taught in elementary that it was just based on the belief of manifest destiny and that the US wanted to buy what is now the southwest from Mexico

But Mexico refused and the Alamo happened so they ended up fighting

We were never taught the real reasons why

 like white southerners bringing slaves into Texas despite Mexico forbidding it

The area being underpopulated and the US avoiding to annex the rest of Mexico since the population isn't mostly white"
30202,"Here's what we got in elementary school:

1. Mexico invited Americans to settle Texas.
2. Those Americans weren't governed fairly by the far-away politicians in Mexico City, so they rebelled.
3. America invaded Mexico in order to protect the rights of its citizens who had settled in Texas, then just kept going.
4. Oh yeah, and ""remember the Alamo."""
30203,"Hey, I remember we were taught about the settlers as well, but school often says they revolted because they wanted to have slaves and Mexico said it was illegal to have slaves."
30204,"Do your textbooks ever talk about the Tejanos and Californios?

We wouldn't have been able to hold California without the indifference of the local population. We didn't have the supply lines the Mexican government did."
30205,"It was like 5 minutes in class, a note about the introduction of repeating small arms, and the territory we gained"
30206,"We learned that Mexico had invited Americans in to settle because they could withstand attacks by the American Indian tribes. These Texans didn’t assimilate into the Mexican culture (even scorned it) and often ignored Mexican laws, which included finding loopholes to bring/own slaves. Eventually Mexico decides to enforce its laws. Texans don’t like it. They declare independence. The US waits a few years to annex Texas. The pretext was that Mexican soldiers allegedly fired at Americans on American soil—lots of alleging there. In the end the US took a lot more land than Mexico."
30207,Really a side note. I’m in the northeast I’m sure it’s taught differently in Texas. Fighting a war with superior weapons rather than with honor is an important theme though. It’s how we beat the British partly because if we stood in a line and fired at each other we would have lost
30208,Three Words:  Remember the Alamo
30209,I mean the war was kind of like if the Magas and Mexicans switched positions. The Americans moved and settled there for a long enough period that they felt like/claimed they were natives. Just how Mexicans were/are the dependents of Spaniards that lived in the americas for so long they felt like they were natives. I don’t personally feel like either side was the good guys or bad guys.
30210,"It was not taught at all at my high school, to my knowledge. IIRC, I took every history class that would have covered it, so I'm pretty confident in that.

I did learn about it in college, though. As others have said, it is taught almost entirely based on the issue of slavery."
30211,"Believe it or not our history classes are very honest to us about our fucked up history, we are not North Korea"
30212,History classes are very honest. The government telling its citizens really happen during a given event in history well that is another story.
30213,Human history in a nutshell.
30214,Not when I was a kid.
30215,In what way could you justify it being treason? I genuinely don't understand that.
30216,"In the NYC area, I was taught that Texas (unsurprisingly) decided the rules of the Spanish Empire didn't apply to them and went of of their way to cause a conflict to happen, knowing they would win.

This caused the mouse trap to spring when Mexico (justifiably) saw he annexation of Texas as an act of war. The US side knew that the crumbling post-Napoleonic colonies of the southern border were not going to be able to put up even a half decent fight, and so brutally rocked a weaker opponent.

It was a strategy to consolidate the resource rich lands to the south west as per Manifest Destiny."
30217,NYC should hire better history teachers as Texas revolted against Mexico which had already won independence from Spain. Two Texas did not know it was going to win and a lot of hope was place on the US coming to the aid of Texas. In fact Santa Anna and the Mexican army where crushing the Texans until the surprise attack at San Jacinto when Texas forces ambushed an unprepared mexican army and captured Santa Anna.
30218,"I dont know where that other poster got educated from, but I was taught Texas declared independence from Mexico.  In my public schooling it was basically Texas was settled by Americans after Mexico invited them in, Texas wanted independence, Alamo happend, Texas won, Joined the US later, Mexican War started over Texas border dispute.

Learning about the details such as the Texians and Tejanos, Santa Anna being a dictator and San Jacinto itself didn't come until taking a specific class on Westward Expansion in undergrad as a history major. My history professor did also tell us that Santa Anna eventually ended up living on Staten Island for a bit."
30219,"It sounds like the NY education system failed you then. It’s considerably more nuanced than that, I’d recommend the Wikipedia page to start with."
30220,The Spanish empire in that area was long gone by Texas independence.  Mexico outlawed slavery.  They wanted to increase population in the northern territories.  American citizens immigrated to the area and brought slaves.  This lead to controversy and eventually rebellion.
30221,You are way over stating the importance of slavery in the Texas Revolution it may have been a sticking point but it wasn't the driving factor.
30222,I removed we learned about it but being so far away from the area it affected and how long ago it was I learned it I’m not sure on much of the details other than we fought over land. I think if I lived closer to the areas involved more details would have stuck. The civil war kind of dwarfs in lives lost and changes to the contra and how it functions and we spend a lot more time on that in school. Also I live closer to the areas affect and have visited battlefields and other sites related to it so it’s more prominent in my memory.
30223,We don’t focus on the Mexican-American war much besides the Alamo in my experience. The focus at that point was on Texas and the increasing tension between slave and free states in the buildup to the Civil War.
30224,"The Alamo wasn't a part of the Mexican-American War.  I made the same mistake, wracking by brain for what we had learned about the war, but when I looked it up, I learned the Alamo was part of an different conflict a decade earlier called the Texas Revolution.  My conclusion having now read about the Mexican-American war is that if we learned about it at all, it was just a blurb in a history book that made no impact."
30225,I remember it being like a few paragraphs in the history books and how it was basically some misunderstanding about how Texas belonged to us.
30226,"I was taught about it in 8th grade. It wasn't anything spectacular. ""The US won against Mexico blah blah blah."" 

My classmate was from Mexico and kept (jokingly) saying ""Cheaters! Cheaters!"""
30227,"Might be partially a case of being from the northeast, but at my school...it wasnt. It was one of those wars that gets mentioned when one of its effects has an affect on another war, and thats sorta it to be honest."
30228,"It was a war of opportunity. The US wanted the land which is taught within the scope of manifest destiny and how it fit within those concepts and goals. Basically manifest destiny was just the belief that the US needed to span the whole width of the continent top to bottom. It was our destiny to do so. Those territories were right in the way. México couldn’t really control the area either. 

Then the casus belli presented itself and the US took advantage of the opportunity. Pretty straightforward."
30229,"I didn't really learn about the Mexican American war until college. What o remember is that the US went to war with Mexico after Texas successfully gained its independence, then it managed to take Texas, NM, Arizona, Nevada, and California from Mexico. I think the war was mainly fought so that the US could gain control of California and Texas."
30230,"""Remember the Alamo"" was about all we got in school when I was a kid."
30231,I haven’t even learned about it yet and I’m in highschool.
30232,We were never taught about it.  The only war we were educated on in school was WW2.
30233,"Hmm, I believe just as a straight historical event. 
No glory or anything, just “this happened”. 
But I could be wrong."
30234,"A lot of people have brought up how the war itself impacted the civil war, but as far as the war itself: in my history class they were pretty honest about it just being a land grab that was weakly justified to take things from a neighbor that we had a military advantage over. I don't remember all of the details on the annexation of Texas, but even if you think that's justified, there was no reason to take the other territory other than the US wanting it and being obsessed with Manifest Destiny at the time."
30235,"Never heard about it in school.

I learned about it on my own."
30236,"I was taught that it was a war for land, which was unjust and imperialist of the US to do (in hindsight) and controversial for the time."
30237,"In Texas at least, it’s taught that upon the annexation of Texas, American soldiers were fired upon by a Mexican patrol in the disputed land between Texas and Mexico, This would then escalate into the Mexican-American war"
30238,"I remember something about Manifest Destiny and how the US tried to buy the land, but Mexico refused. US started a war, took the land and captured Mexico, and then payed them some in damages. 

I think it pretty honest in the sense that there wasn’t any justification given in the class, and more of that the US just wanted it by any means necessary."
30239,"We didn’t Go in depth for me. But basically it was a result of the TX independent movement, which occurred because Mexico wanted to settle the land and control the population better, so allowed American settlers. As Mexico started to realize the danger of having Americans who still identified as American on their land , they attempted to stop it and suppress it, which led to war, and the US stepping in to protect our “people”"
30240,"I think I can answer this from a different perspective. The Mexican American War was taught differently in New Mexico, both because it marked the date when we came under United States control, and because it marked the start of a long period of abuses by American forces and American citizens.

We devoted a good amount of time in our New Mexico history classes to learning about the war. We didn’t focus much on the battles, because New Mexico saw relatively few combat actions (at least between uniformed forces). Instead, we focused on relations between the New Mexican natives and the United States. We learned about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the promises and guarantees that were made to the New Mexicans, and how those promises were systematically broken. 

New Mexican land grants were routinely encroached on despite being protected by the treaty, and when the rightful heirs would try to challenge this in court, they often got nowhere, since no Spanish language proceedings were available, they were challenging wealthier landowners and developers, and records of land ownership were often intentionally destroyed in arson attacks. Land grants and water rights are still major political issues in New Mexico, so it was essential that we understood the roots of these problems.

My hometown is the place where General Kearny first announced that the United States was occupying New Mexico, and we have a historical monument to mark the spot. We also learned about the armed Taos Revolt which took place a year after the US first occupied New Mexico, but I didn’t realize my hometown was the site of a battle in that revolt until earlier this year."
30241,"In Minnesota in the 70s and 80s we weren’t, other than a small footnote on the subject of western expansion. We spent much more time on the interactions with Native Americans of the North and Canada than on any history of the Southern States until the Civil War."
30242,It is taught so little. I had no idea Americans took Mexico City until I was 22 standing in Mexico City's museum...
30243,"I don’t remember learning about it in school. However as an adult homeschooling my son we learned about it and found this song.

[Saint Patrick’s Battalion ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1JwjceS5HLg)"
30244,"it’s not, in my northeastern state."
30245,I had to write a paper on it in class
30246,"This is how I was taught

Basically Polk saw Texas leave Mexico and decided he could get a lot more land if he wanted, so he started a war with Mexico. Tennessee was like “fuck yeah” because they still remembered the Alamo (they were asked to provide 3,000 volunteers for the war and 30,000 showed up). So we went to Mexico and beat the shit out of them

And no offense, but honor doesn’t win wars. It was a war, and we fought to win. The fact we outclassed you doesn’t change that"
30247,"I live in Pennsylvania and it wasn’t really covered, most of the subject matter we covered from the 19th Century focuses on the Civil War, its causes, and then Reconstruction. 

it is possible if you live in Texas or other parts of the Southwest along the border the curriculum looks different and includes it more since its locally relevant there"
30248,"Since I live in Texas, the Mexican-American War is only touched up on during our unit on the Texas Revolution.

So much Spanish vocabulary assignments.

***oh god.***"
30249,"In the state of GA, at least when I was in school, it wasn’t taught. Maybe AP US History or something, I don’t know. But it barely got a mention in my schooling."
30250,"Usually with air quotes around ""war"" because it wasn't much of one.

It was presented mostly as a land grab justified by ""manifest destiny"" -- a term that started right around the same time.

Mexico's viewpoint is largely missing, perhaps viewed as not terribly important given how lopsided the conflict was.  The US was going to do it or not do it, and Mexico's desires and intentions were largely irrelevant."
30251,"We didn’t talk a whole lot about it except for the fact that we invaded.  Battle of Monterrey I think?  It was mainly talked about as being sort of a precursor to the Civil War:  it was the training ground for several big names, it exacerbated the representation debate between slave states and free states, and continued the precedent of conquest"
30252,"Honestly in a lot of classes, it’s bundled in with the lead up to the civil war.   It highlights a lot of the higher ups on both sides fighting together once upon a time.   

We get a little about the Alamo mainly to mention Davey Crockett.   

 But mainly it is discussed in how the new states would add tension to the boiling issue of slavery and how those new states would be added."
30253,The Mexican-American war is taught as a brief disagreement with Mexico that was mostly unremarkable and ended with the US getting a bunch of Indian Territory. Mostly. The character of the Mexicans or their government isn't really addressed and I learned it during the 6th or 7th grade as part of Texas history.
30254,I was taught until I took Mexican history in college
30255,"I remember something about the president sending an army to the border in the hopes that they would encounter the Mexican army and war would break out by virtue of the two armies being near each other.

I think the end goal was to get San Francisco.

I have no idea how accurate this is though."
30256,As I was taught: “Santa Anna was a cocky piece of shit so we beat him up and took his lunch money. Also one of the main generals would become president.”
30257,"“America good, Mexico bad, we got their (our) land”"
30258,"From Ohio, we were taught that the land of North Mexico at that time was more advantageous for railroad construction so we moved to take that land.  I don't recall them trying to paint us as the good guys"
30259,"They honestly don’t teach much about it. But the Alamo is definitely what set it off. Texas was independent, so if it wasn’t for the Mexicans slaughtering Americans at the Alamo, the US wouldn’t have gotten involved. And it’s not like the Alamo was the first instance of Mexicans messing with Americans in Texas. The Mexicans would sell land to Americans that they knew was Comanche territory, wait for the Comanche to come in and kill all the Americans, then sell the land to more Americans. I honestly don’t know anything about us fighting honorably or anything, but there was definitely a lot of reasons for anti-Mexican sentiment by the time the war started. Oh, and there was a lot of land that was super easy to take for our own."
30260,It was kinda the warmup round for all of the big figures of the American Civil War.
30261,Manifest Destiny is how it’s taught in schools. Usually at both the middle school and high school levels depending on the state.
30262,"It was taught as a part of manifest destiny, and how the US attacked first in hopes of getting more land."
30263,I remember it being taught in away that clearly showed we were the aggressors. Outside of that i don't remember
30264,"In Texas it’s taught pretty plainly. We won our revolution and were our own nation for 10 years but then we couldn’t decide on where the border should be. Mexico wanted it on the Brazos River, we wanted it on the Rio Grande. We already asked to be part of the US when we won the rev but they said no then 10 years later they annexed us because manifest destiny essentially and put troops along what was essentially no mans land, then there was a squabble between troops and a war started and the US marched all the way down to Mexico City where Mexico surrendered all of that land"
30265,"The only thing I've got to say about the Mexican account presented here is this: If you're in a war and fighting fair, you're a fucking idiot.

Fight to win. Nothing else matters. Nothing."
30266,We touched it during 6th grade but it was basically nonexistent. Just a bit about the Alamo. I think that most Americans (outside of Texas/parts of the south) wouldn't be able to give you too many details about it.
30267,"It isn't.

I was out of high school long before I ever learned there *was* a Mexican American war."
30268,"I think all the comments here are correct, but I thought I'd add one thing. We are taught that the victory of the American army was not merely due to superior arms, but superior leadership. General Scott was an exceptional military commander; Santa Anna, not so much."
30269,It happened. At least when I was I school that was the extent of it when I was in school.
30270,"Honestly I can't remember it being covered, though I went to a few different schools so it may have fallen between the cracks that way rather than never taught. It is also possible that it was covered for a week or two and I forgot being taught it but I know that I did most of my learning about it on my own through wikipedia."
30271,"We're taught that Texas seceded from Mexico and wanted to join the US, and we said yes, but Mexico didn't like that, so we went to war and the Mexicans killed Davy Crockett at the Alamo and then we won and took everything north of El Paso."
30272,"Something something ""Remember the Alamo""?

I suspect it was basically just a land grab on our part."
30273,"I cannot recall ever learning about this conflict in the American public school system in the 1980s and 90s. If it was mentioned they just glossed over it, because I don’t remember it at all."
30274,The what?
30275,"I actually don’t remember really learning a lot about it, if anything I learned about it maybe in elementary or middle school? definitely not high school though"
30276,It basically treated as either a completely boring war for land or a righteous godly war and the epitome of manifest destiny. At least in highschool for me.
30277,"My school never taught us this, I don't even know what happened"
30278,"Essentially it is summarized as part of White, Anglo Americans efforts to fulfill their “Manifest Destiny,” of conquering the “New World.”

Davy Crockett, & Jim Bowie were “heroes” for standing up to the villainous Santa Anna at the Alamo. That’s the only moment of the whole war that gets 2 min of attention. And that’s only because it was immortalized by Disney."
30279,"Well, as someone living in Texas, its definitely biased to say the least, and, especially during the Texan revolution, (taught somewhat together) Santa Anna is made out as an evil doctor who turned his back on his people for power and that the Mexicans were heavily repressing Texas, and during the Mexican American war it is taught that, while the US did antagonize Mexican forces, they still started the war"
30280,"It really depends. It depends on everything from the state, to the county, to the school, to the teacher. For us personally, we were taught pretty similarly and how a lot of people, including some Americans at the time, felt we were wrong and it was unnecessary"
30281,It’s barely covered at all. At least in MN.
30282,"I don't even remember touching on it at all. It was kinda like ""oh btw the Mexican-American War happened. anyway let's move on"""
30283,There was a war. Mexico lost. That's about all.
30284,It's not really talked about as much. It's mostly overshadowed by the Civil War.
30285,"We don’t cover it to a huge degree, just the basics most of the time"
30286,"""Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States."" -Porfario Diaz"
30287,"We took someones limb and sent it up to Illinois so they couldn't get it back. Now its in a museum.

Growing up in California we learned a bit. I dont remember some of it."
30288,It’s not. At least not in the North where I grew up.
30289,"We are taught that we started the war, which we did. We were also taught how mexico was very unstable at the time and much of the land taken was barely administered and only really part of mexico on paper.  It was two countries fighting over conquest. The US won."
30290,"To be honest, I don’t remember. I’m sitting here thinking “oh yeah... wasn’t that what the Alamo is about?”

So however it was taught, it was not impactful."
30291,"They teach us that the some politicians wanted to fight mexico to conquer some land, it was very controversial so the peeps that wanted to go to war decided to send troops into contested territory in texas and used the Mexicans shooting at US troops as an excuse for war since the US claiming the Territory meant mexico firing at US troops in the contested Territory was technically an invasion

They won pretty easily and some even wanted to conquer all of Mexico but that didn't happen because it was a pretty stupid idea

That's what I was taught"
30292,I wasn't really taught too much about it in school. Vaguely remember Mexicans killed Davey Crockett at the Alamo. Mostly seemed like it was Indians in the west so pioneers came over and settled it peacefully.
30293,"It doesn't have a huge emphasis over here other than, ""hey we fought this war against Mexico for a while"". I think we should teach a lot more about it though.

We *do* teach westward expansion and manifest destiny, which is usually seen as the cause of the war."
30294,"**** Carthage vs Rome  (the Punic Wars) ****

I read a lot of history and this is as good as it gets.   On one side, Carthage.  Based in modern day Tunisia it was an immensely rich trading empire with a strong navy and the best mercenary armies money could buy.  Slingshoters from the Baeleric islands,  Numidian african cavalary, Spanish Swordsman and elephants.   On the other side a newly emerging power on the Italian peninsula with an inexhaustable supply of soldiers and incredible grit.  You would not believe the twists and turns in this epic 100 year clash.   Listen to this podcast.  It is a fantastic.  Dan Carlins hardcore history:

http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive/Show-21---Punic-Nightmares-I/Roman-republic-Carthage

There were 3 punic wars lasting 100 years and it ended in the utter annhiliation of an entire civilization.   During the course of the war, there was the biggest naval battle in history with 200,000 troops involved (not surpassed, even in modern times) and 2 of the greatest generals of all times clashed, Hannibal and Scipio.   Rome kept losing battles which would have crippled any normal empire but they were indefatigable, ruthless and their ultimate victory was so cruel and vindictive that if you can keep a dry eye reading about the fall of Carthage then you are a stronger man than me."
30295,"As for the rest, I am of the opinion that Carthage must be destroyed."
30296,Hey! That's my line!
30297,"""redditor for 1 year""

*golf clap*"
30298,"""Cato the Elder, for example, ended every speech (no matter the subject) by saying, 'Also, I think Carthage must be destroyed.'"" Christ man, you never let it rest eh?"
30299,"It sounds way more cool in Latin:

    Carthago delenda est."
30300,*Carthago delenda est.*
30301,Fuck that. I always picked Carthage in AOE1 for the War Elephants. They just tusked through everything.
30302,"Just finished reading ""Caesar: Life of a Colossus"" and one thing that the author mentions is that Carthage just didn't understand why Rome didn't give up.  Other cultures understood when they had lost...the Romans just didn't understand they had lost."
30303,And then when they finally won they made sure nothing ever came from Carthage again!
30304,DUDE! Spoiler Alert?!?!?!?!?!
30305,"That podcast is some great listening. Thanks for the link, I am a new subscriber!"
30306,Dan Carlin is the Man!
30307,I came here to post this. Dan Carlin rocks.
30308,"The thought of seeing Hanibal's men trying to navigate elephants through the Alps is hilarious. It is a shame though that Carthage suffered such a horrible fate; at the height of their empire, you were literally paid to be a Carthaginian."
30309,"Fuck Yeah! LOVE Hardcore History.

That is all."
30310,"Rome wasn't even an Empire back then, it was only a Republic, didn't even rule over what is now Italy."
30311,It's pretty surprising how such a small state way back then when the population of the planet was so much smaller could muster these armies over and over again. Just how many people were sat around *not* pissing off the Carthaginians or the Greeks or the Gauls?
30312,">  there was the biggest naval battle in history with 200,000 troops involved (not surpassed, even in modern times)    
    
That's being [contested](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_naval_battle_in_history) actually."
30313,I've recently found the battles between Germany and Russia during WWII to be FUCKING INSANE!  In particular the Battles of Kursk and Stalingrad.
30314,Stalingrad is..absurd.  Absolutely absurd.  My roommate in college moved here from Russia when he was 8-9 or so.  I was asking him about what he knows of Russian history and he told me his Grandmother was in the battle of Stalingrad.  I guess she worked in a tank factory that was producing tanks that would go down the block and fight as soon as they were done.
30315,">tank factory that was producing tanks that would go down the block and fight as soon as they were done

I did this last night, to the Protoss"
30316,"out of all these horrific comments, I then get to this one and giggle, damn you."
30317,"Yeah, when trying to imagine casualties in the millions........I don't know.  America has never experienced such carnage in this magnitude.  Needs to be taught in high schools."
30318,"I agree, I love American History, but I do think that there should be more time spent on learning about the wars that had nothing to do with it. There are these gaps, when the US is in Isolation and they just kind of skip what was happening up until stuff leads into WWI."
30319,"i don't know if it's like this throughout the country, but I took world history my sophomore year, where we basically learned about the wars that had nothing to do with American history."
30320,"see my world history had mostly to do with stuff America is interested in: 
Early man
Greeks
Romans 
British
America
India and China (for trade importance) 

Almost nothing on Japan, Australia, New Zealand (which we didn't even talk about as a country...at all) or the majority of Europe except to talk about how crazy it is because power/country borders change so much."
30321,"Most world history I've ever seen was just one of ""Hey, let's talk about Europe!"" things. I took a world history class at my University and we were running behind so the professor just cut India and Japan out of the lessons. 2 very rich histories, just completely disregarded, it was bullshit."
30322,"If you've never heard ""Hardcore History,"" a podcast by Dan Carlin, I highly recommend it: http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive

He has a series on Germany's WWII Eastern front called ""Ghosts of the Ostfront"" that really opened my eyes to some of the things that happened there.

His series on the Punic wars is also very good."
30323,"Whenever my life gets tough, I think about the eastern front, and what my grandparents went through during that period, and what the Jewish, Poles, hell everyone suffered under the Nazis.... tremendous perspective."
30324,"I do this too, more people need to adopt this outlook IMO. Helps keep you humble and realise what is really important."
30325,"[This Clip](http://military.discovery.com/videos/20th-century-battlefields-episode-3-1942-stalingrad.html) is a good synopsis of what happened at Stalingrad. [Here's](http://military.discovery.com/convergence/20cbattles/episode/episode_03.html) a link to the episode description.

I couldn't imagine being a soldier in either battle. I don't see how survivors could deal with the after effects."
30326,"Can I recommend the book [war without garlands](http://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Without-Garlands-Operation-Barbarossa/dp/0711033242/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281111966&sr=8-1). It presents the invasion in a very good way taking into account mainly the german perspective but also the russian views before invasion and during it, up until moscow 1941. It is extremely eye opening especially the chapter named after the title which puts into perspective the reasons soldiers did what they did and why both sides fought for dear life. I am fascinated with the eastern front and have read many german memoirs of that period, I enjoy learning about the german army and the war in russia. Can I point out that it is easy to look back and see what the germans did wrong, what the russians did right, but at that point in time the initial operation barbarossa plans were pretty damn good going on the previous invasions. What germany nor the rest of the world expected was how hard the russians would fight! In previous battles once the poles, brits, french were encircled they gave up but the russians fought senseless break out attacks and annihilated themselves but slowly wore down the german divisions teeth. The germans were Victored to Death."
30327,"[This is an excellent book on the Eastern Front](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Forgotten-Soldier-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304352403/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281116643&sr=1-1) by an Alsatian Frenchman who volunteered for service with the Germans in 1942. It's a memoir, and the 1st hand accounts are appalling: for starters, experiencing an artillery barrage (people are simply buried alive sometimes), being stuck on a truck in -30 degree weather with dysentery induced diarrhea and no place even to lay down. Not to mention returning home to a lot of hard questions..."
30328,"The Eastern Front (AKA the real WW2) was awesome. Tank battles, sieges, scorched earth, everything about it."
30329,I doubt the people involved would share your adjectives. I'd say it was highly interesting and probably the most extreme example of total war in world history with the highest degree of human suffering ever. Hardly awesome though unless you're using it as hyperbole in describing the scale of it all.
30330,"Yep, 'awesome' as in Yosemite/universe/hurricanes."
30331,Awesome doesn't necessarily imply something good.
30332,"Read [""City of Thieves""](http://www.amazon.com/City-Thieves-Novel-David-Benioff/dp/0452295297/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281111592&sr=8-1) for an extremely entertaining glimpse into this."
30333,"I joined Reddit just to add this, though no one will see it.  The Taiping Rebellion in China has got to be one of the craziest things you will ever read about (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion).  Basically, this guy (Hong Xiuquan) was on his way to take a civil service exam.  Some missionary was preaching and handed him a translated version of the Bible.  He had some dream where he was standing next to Jesus and God or something.  Then SEVEN YEARS LATER he digs these pamphlets out of his closet and interprets the dream to mean that he is Jesus' younger brother.  From there he basically started some type of cult and took over half of China.  I don't know much besides the basic outline, but something like 20 MILLION people were killed as a result.  It has to be one of the most bizarre stories that no one has ever heard of."
30334,"The Punic War's, specifically The second Punic War. Hannibal is just so amazing, one of the greatest General's ever. At Cannae he faced 85,000 Roman's with only 50,000 soldiers and came out on top, 50,000 dead Romans and only 5000 dead In all of Hannibal's forces."
30335,"The Conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar is also interesting.  The war machines that he put together during his run through Gaul just boggles the mind. 

Granted, it's a bit of grandstanding by Caesar, but it's still fascinating."
30336,"I like how, just like the man himself, username Gaius_Caesar speaks in the third person... :)"
30337,Upvote for knowledge!
30338,"Well, my vanity is legendary..."
30339,Why did you just break character? *WHY???*
30340,Oh shut up you cock sucker of Bithynian king!
30341,"Ceasar's conquest of Gaul and the civil war against Pompey was incredible and it has been studied by most military generals to this day including Napoleon, Hitler and Patton. The month of July was named after his clan (the julii, hence his name Julius) and the terms Kaiser and Tsar were both derived from the name of Ceasar. Truly an epic dude."
30342,I'm not impressed with Caesar's run in Gaul. He never did defeat that one village.
30343,The bridge across the rhine which was built in ten days and the enormous fleet going across the channel for the second landing in Britain are some feats which would be hard for any other nation then and even now to do.
30344,"Hannibal was a badass, but Scipio Africanus was no slouch either, I meas aside from the fact that he has the manliest name in history."
