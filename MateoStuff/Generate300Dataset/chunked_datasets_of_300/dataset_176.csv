57857,"I wear Aventus to work daily, we have 100's of customers a day and I rarely go a shift without somebody making a comment. I've never received a negative comment, people I'm familiar with will often say ' I thought I could smell you ', or ' I knew you were here before I saw you '. But they always explain that it's a good thing even though I smirk and laugh. Green Irish Tweed also gets comments but somebody did once call me out for overspraying it. I've not had any success with any of the others I've owned."
57858,"My husband wears Aqua di Gio and it's delicious. Not much of a cologne girl but this stuff smells fantastic. 

Sephora sells a sampler pack of colognes that is worth picking up if you're looking for something new. It comes with a coupon that gets you a full-sized bottle of whatever scent from the sampler that you end up liking. Good deal!"
57859,"My girlfriend and I went shopping for cologne one day and we picked this out. I rarely wear it, but when we were doing the long distance thing I would always put it on before we met. It was a 14 hour flight and when we hugged she would always take a deep breath and give me one of those sexy smiles. I always thought she was crazy, but according to her that stuff could make me smell good even after a long travel day."
57860,"PEOPLE! Yeah, Aqua di Gio smells good and all but it loses its touch and uniqueness when every single average joe wears it! It's the most common and well known cologne for men out there. Go out and find an interesting and unusual scent that fits with you and your personal scent!"
57861,Caveat emptor.  Aqua di Gio is the unmistakable smell of douche.
57862,You're thinking Axe.
57863,"Picked out **Bvlgari Pour Homme** for my ex when we went shopping together at Sephora; I swear that stuff has got some mighty strong panty-repellent mixed into it. I couldn't keep off him when he had it on. I'd bury my face in his neck and breathe deep, wishing I could eat him up and swallow him whole."
57864,Panty repellent?
57865,"Yea, it keeps the panties off."
57866,"Main Entry: 1re·pel·lent
Variant(s): also re·pel·lant \ri-ˈpe-lənt\
Function: adjective
Etymology: Latin repellent-, repellens, present participle of repellere
Date: 1643

1 : serving or tending to drive away or ward off —often used in combination <a mosquito-repellent spray>
2 : arousing aversion or disgust 

i think you need a new word"
57867,You Anal Alice. You Killjoy Karen.
57868,Please tell me there is more where that came from. I literally laughed 30 seconds straight at that.
57869,"hahahah dude, this comment was from four months ago, did you really only just see it? 

And yes, there is plenty more where that came from, as long as you weren't being facetious :)"
57870,"Yeah I just got it. I never got an orangered from your reply? Anyway, im not being facetious, im serious! HAHA I was looking through some of your comments and your a super witty chick."
57871,"haha well, thanks!"
57872,I've got that one and I always get complimented on it.
57873,Just some advice: colognes and perfumes smell different on everyone. It mixes with your skin smell/personal scent/pheromones. I always go try a few on before buying new perfume. Wait a few minutes after dabbing it on your skin and the smell will be different than if you just spray it in the air.
57874,"You are correct sir, this is particularly true of colognes with metallic tones, e.g. davidoff echo. The smell that we traditionally associate with metal, is actually only the smell metal has after reacting with the skin."
57875,Well this is nice.  So... the best smelling cologne is... EVERYTHING
57876,"I consider myself somewhat of a cologne aficionado, here's a list of my favorites

* (1) Issey Miyaki pour homme 
* (2) Very Sexy for Him (Victoria's Secret)
* (3) Gucci by Gucci
* (4) Lacoste pour homme

According to an eager sales guy at Macy's, a lot of my favorite colognes have sandalwood essence in common"
57877,Which Issey Myaki is your favorite?  Would you happen to have a link?
57878,"I like both Lacoste pour homme and Lacoste essential. Both of those make me want to lick my boyfriend's neck, to try and taste the smell (Pro tip, doesn't taste as nice as it smells.)"
57879,Your review just made me place a order..... We will see how the girlfriend responds :)
57880,Issey Miyaki is my absolute favourite. It's like heaven in a bottle.
57881,Very Sexy is my choice.  Hands down IMO the best for my body type.
57883,Titties wants to know what you meant by that.
57884,I sure do like my YSL L'homme.
57885,L'homme is my favorite scent. I try not to tell people about it because it's oh so delicious
57886,absolutely my friend.
57887,"Is this the one with the octagon shaped cap?  If so, dang, probably one my all time favorites...after my top 4"
57888,"Yep, exactly the one.

I didn't even really like it at the time of the purchase; I had tried a ton out at the counter at a Nordstroms and this was the one I 'settled' with.

I've come to really enjoy it."
57889,"Cologne depends on where you are going, what you are wearing and what time it is. Here is what I use and recommend:
Everyday: Ed Hardy Love and Luck; Issey Miyake
Club wear: 212 - Carolina Herrera; Black by Kenneth Cole; Versace Pour Homme 
Rule of thumb: light, sweet, fresh scents for everyday; basically anything thats not overpowering. 
When you go out use something heavier, bolder and something that lingers. But dont over do it. 

If your body chemistry sucks don't spray cologne on your skin, spray it on your clothes. 

(Used to work in a perfume/cologne store for few years)"
57890,I love Aqua di Gio by Armani.  I have a hard time not crawling all over men wearing it.
57891,"It's called Sex Panther by Odeon. It's illegal in nine countries... Yep, it's made with bits of real panther, so you know it's good. They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time it works, every time."
57892,Stings the nostrils....Brian I'm going to be honest that smells like pure gasoline.
57893,That makes no sense.
57894,It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!
57895,"Aqua di Gio, hands down."
57896,Obsession by Calvin Klein.
57897,"Jake by Hollister.  So good.  Every boy should wear it, cause then I'd be in heaven.

Don't wear Axe.  It's really, really disgusting."
57898,Original honest to god Old Spice. I love that stuff.
57899,au naturelle.
57900,"Brut. You don't wear Brut, Brut wears you."
57901,"*[Vulva](http://www.vulva-original.com/de/)*

Seriously though, who buys this shit?"
57903,"Armani Code for formal evenings, Davidoff Echo for business, and D&G The One for a big night out."
57904,None/soap.
57905,Fierce by Abercrombie.
57906,i have also heard alot of good things about this stuff
57907,"ahh wore it in high school, good times"
57908,I like the Victoria Secret Very Sexy for Him.
57909,Opus 1870 by Penhaligon's
57910,"I'm a fan of Diesel Fuel for Life, personally."
57911,Was very surprised by the quality of Diesel colognes. If Only the Brave wasn't in such a ridiculous bottle I think it would sell very well.
57913,Lacoste Essential. Everyone wears Aqua di Gio and Abercrombie but those smell really good too.
57915,"Was going to say Issey Miyake. I keep moving on to something else, then coming back to it. Tried D&G pour homme, Prada, Armarni Code, CK One, Hermes.  I always end up buying Issey Miyake pour homme half way through the replacement brand."
57916,"Ultraviolet by Paco Rabanne.
I've received compliments on it, but smell it for yourself."
57917,"hell yes. thank god there is someone out there who also like it besides me.
I'm using it for like 7 years and I'm not thinking about changing it in near future.."
57918,"Hells yeah. I had a similar reaction to a guy down below; my friend grabbed me and forced her face into my chest and would let me go. Also happened with one of my bi-guy friends, which was less pleasant but still gratifying."
57919,"Thank god It's not that popular you know, I would be really jealous if a guy who is more good looking than me wears this instead of fucking Aqua di Gio"
57920,bvlgari aqua
57921,L'Eau par Kenzo! By far!
57922,"Reminds me of the Sopranos

    Jimmy Altieri: I got enough cologne on?
    Christopher Moltisanti: You smell like Paco Rabanne crawled up your ass and died.
    Jimmy Altieri: Whoah, easy for you to say. I don't get young ones like before."
57923,"As nice as Aqua Di Gio is, its the worlds most popular mens cologne, sot unless you want to smell like the masses, leave it alone. Cool Water by Davidoff is great too, but unfortunately has gone a bit the same way. Armani Code is nice, Versace Man is good too. Currently I'm on Hypnose by Lancome and loving it. Got some POWER by 50 Cent on the way soon from a friend in the USA :)

I find with colognes its best to buy smaller bottles, and constantly rotate. I haven't yet bought a second bottle of any cologne; I like moving on and finding awesome new scents."
57924,"Work up a sweat, then go out and pull the bitches in like a shrimp trawler."
57925,Polo Green.
57926,The one I made out of murdered french women. More of a perfume though..
57927,Two different girls that I know have said they pretty much pounce on anybody that wears Cool Water by Davidoff.
57928,Are these girls 35+ by any chance?
57929,Was one of the things my now-wife first liked about me.
57930,My girlfriend says cologne is for douchebags. Maybe that's an east coast thing?
57931,is your girlfriend a guy?
57932,No. But she prefers unperfumed men. I think she sees perfume as feminine. As for her being a guy...? Don't guys prefer perfume on women? I do. To each their own I guess.
57933,is your guyfriend a girl?
57934,212 Men by Carolina Herrera.  The best smelling cologne ever!
57935,I wear Varvatos by John Varvatos in the winter and Essential by Lacoste in the summer. If I'm feeling fancy I'll wear Touch by Burberry too. I like the Lacoste for summer because it has a citrus top note. The Varvatos is probably my favorite though.
57936,Reaction by Kenneth Cole
57937,L'eau D'Issey Pour Homme.
57938,"I don't wear much cologne any more, but both Prada and Hanae Mori used to get me a lot of compliments from the fairer sex."
57939,I love the way Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier smells on a man.
57940,My girlfriend wears FCUK for men and it sure is a panty dropper for me. We're doing the long distance thing right now and she gave me bottle to keep around and sniff!
57941,"Polo Blue OR Aqua di Gio - I dig the ""clean"" scents over the musky ones!"
57942,Polo Blue is great. It smells so good I almost want to wear it myself.
57943,Burberry London; it's a classic.
57944,... for chavs
57945,Armani Aqua di Gio .. hands down
57946,"I have a cologne called Catalyst and I think it is great! It can be described as having a deep, rich cinnamon scent to it. I haven't met anyone else who has it, so in terms of uniqueness it's a plus!"
57947,Roma by Laura Biagiotti. Burberry London is a close second.
57948,Masculine by Dolce & Gabbana
57949,I wear Chrome (and I'm not really a cologne guy).  Lacoste is really nice too (the alligator shirt company).
57950,Derek Jeter's Driven cologne smells pretty good. Another one i use is Fahrenheit by Dior. My favorite has to be Dreamer by Versace
57951,"Armani Code 

Azzaro Chrome"
57952,"Gay man here. I've gone through dozens of cologne over the years and I currently have 11 bottles in the bathroom. Needless to say, I love the stuff. 

My favorite of all time is Sentiment by Escada. No other scent I've worn has even gotten close to the number of compliments I've gotten while having it on. You can't find it in stores anymore so buy it online (make sure its the cologne, not the perfume). Best part is that it wasn't widely distributed so you'll smell unique! My second favorite is Gucci Pour Hommes II."
57953,"I just wear what the girls im with when shopping suggest generally..

Ive got Porshe stuff, Ralph Lauren Polo Travel Exclusive, Ralph Lauren Double Black."
57954,"I dont wear colognes, i just apply a good aftershave after...i shave. 

My current favourite is Ogallala Bay rum. It makes my skin soft and sexy, repairs it and moisturises it as well as adding a pleasing, subtle sent."
57955,Frankincense oil.
57956,"bvlgari extreme: black pepper, black and green tea."
57957,"Lacoste Red. Light and sweet, it'll get you noticed faster than the Cool Water...err ""Chrome"" you're considering."
57958,"The Hugo Boss scent my ex always wears. It's like a spell, I always end up sleeping with him again!"
57959,"* Pi by Givenchy
* Kistna by The Body Shop
* Sandalwood and Vanilla oils, blended on the skin"
57960,Essence of Pussy
57961,Woods by A&F (from when they were still a smallish company in Missouri). They kept it for a long time but discontinued it a few years ago. Haven't been in a store since.
57962,The best girl perfume I have ever smelled is Perry Ellis 360. I also love Ralph.. by Ralph Lauren... Mmmm it reminds me of a hot stripper I knew..
57963,"Revert by rue21, fairly cheap but smells greaaat

http://www.rue21.com/fragrances/Detail.aspx?id=8866"
57964,"Nobody?

Ok, I like Sex Panther. 60% of time... It works every time.


On a serious note, a date panty dropper is Attitude by Armani. Very nice. Anything by Hugo Boss and Lacoste tends to be good for a first date."
57965,"J.Peterman's 1903. I used to have three to four rotating colognes. Then I got the J. Peterman. Girls tell me they like it bcuz it is sweet, but still has a prominent musky undertone. Whatever. As long as it is attracting the opposite sex I am going to keep buying it."
57967,I use Ralph Lauren Purple Label and love it. Pain in the ass as you can only buy it at Saks 5th.
57968,"Summer: Polo Black - Cheap and effective.

Every other time: Truefitt & Hill's Spanish Leather Cologne - Makes you smell like [The Most Interesting Man in the World.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI58wj4b4g0)"
57969,"Nautica Voyage, the old one you can't get in stores anymore.
Creed Erolfa, for special occasions."
57970,"Huge Boss Deep Red, and Versace Blue Jeans... mmmm"
57971,Versace Blue Jeans
57972,"It may be a bit corny, but I have a bottle of Adidas Sport cologne (no longer made) that has served me well.  Before that was regular Old Spice."
57973,"Claiborne sport. I think they stopped making it a few years ago, so I stocked up on some big bottles. I love it."
57974,"It's harder to find now, but Michael Jordan had his own fragrance line back in the 90s. That shit was my secret fucking weapon in college."
57975,There's a good thread on Basenotes.net on [this topic.](http://www.basenotes.net/threads/212334-Which-scent-gets-you-the-most-female-compliments) It's a pretty cool community and got me really interested in trying different smells. I'm digging on Eau Sauvage by Christian Dior at the moment.
57976,"My husband wears Burberry Brit I think, I love it!"
58383,Sex Panther
57978,"I'm going to punch the guy who says ""60% of the time it works every time""."
57979,Agreed. I had to punch myself in the balls for saying Sex Panther.
57980,"Punch yourself, you said it"
57981,tHE AXe Effect!
57982,"i borrowed my brother's spray on deodorant once. It was Axe Kilo ( i know, ugh) was shocked by how much the gf and the women i worked with liked it. I liked the smell of it as well, i thought it smelled like cookies..........yes im kinda chubby.

edit= also got Antonio Banderas cologne as kind of a gag gift once, but dug the smell of it, and chicks that liked it and asked thought it was hilarious that i was wearing it."
57983,"Versace Blue Jeans. Hideous packaging. But a panty ripper.
Issey Miyake: Eau D'Issey

Never ever ever ever: 
Drakkar Noir
Cool Water.  
Old Spice"
57984,"My favorite panty-dropper? I would have to say my body's natural pheromones. Seriously. Have fun wasting your money and smelling like a douche, though."
57985,[Gucci by Gucci](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUtkQ1lp_Yo)
57986,Tesco's antibacterial deodorant. Funnily enough the person who complimented me was someone in Tesco.
57987,"Finally, something I can afford and in suitable for trash I am"
57988,I remember one time I was using the scent graphite from bath and body works and my buddies were telling me I smelled like a whore lol
57989,Me and my brother in law swear by teakwood.
57990,"Speaking as a lady whose boyfriend likes colognes, I honestly find Bath & Body Works scents more pleasant and less overwhelming than a lot of the $60+ stuff. Ocean is my favorite but Teakwood is a close 2nd."
57991,L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent. Some of my female friends have told me it smells really good.
57992,I didn’t plan on waking up and spending $80 on cologne today but this thread sold me on this one hahaha
57993,Try it first.  Some smells just don’t work on some people inexplicably
57994,"That's because they mix with oils in your skin and some other things, so even if the brand is good, it might not be the best for you, that's why you must keep trying new things until you find the one you feel is the best for you, or at least decent"
57995,"I actually took a female friend with me for express purpose of trying scents *on me* for this reason. Subtle is the key. You don't want to over whelm  or offend someone with your scent. Less is more and I've recieved lots of compliments. We settled on [Paul Sebastian](https://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/413767/900.jpg). 

*Edit: mom's can also help*"
57996,"*Your scent should not arrive before you or linger after you’ve left.*

Words to live by."
57997,"another one i like: “Cologne should be discovered, not announced.”"
57998,I used to have a boss. Cologne freak. You could know he was in the building when you smelled him over 150 feet away.
57999,"""Nice perfume. Must you bathe in it?"""
58000,"""Wear only enough cologne to be smelled in the arms of a lover. Wear enough aftershave to be smelled by no one, ever."""
58001,"Definitely agree. But how do you find out? Also doesn't that sort of *become* your smell? On a trip with some friends they smelled my cologne and said, ""Oh my god, it smells like u/Khasimir""."
58002,"Go to Macy's, Nordstrom, or really any upscale department store with a fragrance counter. They will give/sell you a tiny tester of most fragrances that you can take home. L'homme is a major flagship right now, so your odds are pretty good they'll have some on hand.
  
They can also just spray a tester on you. Give it a few hours and see if you still like it.
  
I'm a woman, but I made my husband pick a cologne for our wedding. Some scents we really liked straight out of the bottle (like Sauvage), but smelled like musty old man after a few hours. We actually did end up choosing L'homme because the scent didn't change too much on his skin. But this is 100% up to your own skin chemistry and preferences."
58003,Thanks for the advice (this whole thread is great) but Sausage has some of the most absurdly cringe marketing I’ve ever seen. Depp dressed up like he’s 23 riding a motorbike around the desert with 38 silver bangles when in actual fact he’s 53 or whatever. God I find it so ridiculous.
58004,Sausage cologne lol
58005,"Yeah, I know that scent all too well! 🍆"
58006,Buy the biggest bottle you feel comfortable.  The price per volume is way cheaper the larger you go.
58007,"I did see that, but settled on the 2.0 oz bottle, since that qualified for free shipping by $1 and I use fragrances sparingly so it should last me quite a while anyway."
58008,There are definitely worse things to drop $80 on!
58009,"Same, wtf? Advertising is getting smarter"
58010,"Which one is it? I believe there’s a new version and an old one. It’d be great if you can share a pic. 

There’s also an “intense” one."
58011,"Not sure what you mean by ""new version."" It is just YSL L'homme. Silver cap, clear bottle, light yellow juice."
58012,"Thanks for the answer, really appreciate it!

When I went to Sephora asking about it, they showed me La Nuit De L’Homme, you just made me realize when people say “L’Homme” they aren’t shortening the name “La Nuit De L’Homme”, they are talking about another perfume.

It’s La Nuit De L’Homme that has an older version according to the lady at Sephora."
58013,"La Nuit De L'Homme will also get you a lot of compliments. I only have that one though, so I can't compare it to L'Homme."
58014,"Yeah, it doesn't last as long as the older version. Still such a great scent though, this was going to be my answer lol"
58015,Second that
58016,"> L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent

Forgive me, I am so bad in cologne/perfumes. What is the difference between Eua de Toilette spray and Eau de Parfum? And is the intense better?"
58017,"It's literally just a name given to the concentration of scent-to-water.

Perfume = 20-30%

Eau de Parfum = 15-20%

Eua de Toilet = 5-15%

Eau de Cologne = 2-4%

Eau Fraiche = 1-3% (like body spray or after shave)"
58018,"Great breakdown, thanks.

This also corresponds to [how long they last](https://www.dapperconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/overview-longevity-e1564830400205.jpg)."
58019,"Toilette is a weaker, Parfum stronger... its up to you and what you prefer 2 of my 3 are Toilette one is Parfum.. Toilette most likely won't last all day but is great for a night out, parfum is great for all day but can be a little cloying on a hot day or the first 30 minutes or so"
58020,the ginger hombre ysl is godly
58021,"This is the one. A friend got it for me because she likes when guys smell good.

I thought she was saying I smelled meh. Now I’m thinking...

God damn it."
58022,"Yeah, dude. She was into you.   Probably wanted you to smell like someone else she had great memories of and wanted to make some with you."
58023,or maybe he doesnt shower and she wanted to make him spend $80 instead of knifing her nose off
58024,"That’s my go-to as well, I get compliments constantly"
58025,"I agree, this one smells awesome."
58026,This was my daily for a while. Pretty much all YSL are legit.
58027,La Nuit De L'Homme for me
58028,"Dear god I slept with a guy who wore this and now, close to a decade later, I remember the cologne but not the guy’s last name."
58029,la nut de le hommie lmao
58030,This one’s a panty DROPPER
58031,"Girl here, got it for my male room mate for Xmas. It's AMAZING. I will stroll by his bathroom and take a whiff. LOL"
58032,damn you did a good one for your roommate!
58033,"Was going to add this, glad someone else did. Only one that’s given me solid compliments apart from when sausage by Dior first came out"
58034,"This one! I've received so many compliments from both girls *and* guys, and quite a few have even asked me what it was so they can get it for themselves or their SO. I've been using Bleu de Chanel EDP recently since I found it lasts longer which is perfect for when working at the office, but I might buy another bottle of L'Homme by YSL EDT for dates and hangouts."
58035,"Wow I did not expect my cologne to be the top comment. I thought it was my secret smell lol. 

I use the ultime version for the last 4 years, and i love it still. My other one is lacoste white"
58036,My brain will not read that word as anything other than lactose.
58037,"Almost skipped this thread cuz I was like “I don’t need cologne my shit smells bomb!”

I clicked just to see if anyone mentioned my favorite scent. Top of the thread aye"
58038,"I have 2 bottles of the old reformulation, I only use it in very special occasions"
58039,Chanel De Blue
58040,"Bought this a few years ago on a whim. 

I have tried different colognes for ages trying to find one that suits me. 

Chanel knocked it out of the park. Works great for me. And always gets a compliment."
58041,That's literally the best one I ever had but the price kills me
58043,I'm not even gonna click it cause I already know it's gonna be bad 😂
58044,"Damn, Bleu de Chanel is way too far down this list. This is by far my most complimented cologne. 

I get the eau de parfum as it lasts longer and has a richer scent. Eau de toilette is good too for a quick afternoon outing but definitely get the parfum if you plan on being out longer."
58045,I agree. That was the first one I thought of when I found this thread. I've gotten decent compliments with my prada carbon as well (sort of a sauvage clone) but my Bleu de Chanel EDP if by far my favorite and biggest compliment magnet
58046,"Montblanc legend, YSL L’Homme, Montblanc explorer, and Francis Kurkdjian Paris are my top 4 fav colognes. For clubs and stuff I’d say Versace Eros and Acqua di Gio.

If you want to learn more about fragrances. Check out the /r/Fragrance sub or even /r/fragsplits"
58047,Was just about to come here to say this. I feel like I live on r/Fragrance some days 😂
58048,"Yves Saint Laurent Y

Dior Sauvage

Mont Blanc (idk which one but the bottle was black/copper)"
58049,"Second Y by Yves Saint Laurent, specifically the eau de parfum. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments from women and men with it. By far my favorite cologne."
58051,Fourth. I’m a woman who wears it. I get compliments from both men and women on it too.
58052,one two three fourth to the fizzith.... all the gucci dior etc ive worn and nothing gets compliments like the YSL Y
58053,"Was out with my husband one night and we ran into our lesbian friend.  She greeted us with a hug and I complimented her on her cologne and asked what it was. She said it was Sauvage.  
Well, I guess I seemed really into it because my husband went out and bought it the next day."
58054,"Reading this, made me [think of this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/dc/4f/6fdc4f5b728fe8216b24210dd36f5f0b.png)"
58055,Dior Sauvage smells good but overused af atleast in the UK imo
58056,"Yes, eau sauvage!"
58057,Versace Eros EDT and Azzaro wanted. The secretary at my school told me I smell good yesterday was wearing Eros. Azzaro wanted is the scent from up above. My cousin had one he told me a lady said she was gonna kidnap him lol.
58058,haha now that's the kind of compliment I'm looking for
58059,Hahaha assuming you're buying from amazon check reviews first for ratings you dont want a watered down fragrance do you.
58061,Bring a little sack of coffee to clear the nose pallette. You sniff the coffee in-between scents and you don't get headaches after.
58062,Here to second Azzaro. Almost every time I wear it and go to the store I get asked what I’m wearing and most women respond with “Well I’m getting that for my husband!”
58063,"I have to second Eros, had someone bite my neck because they “couldn’t help themselves”"
58064,"That's assault, brother."
58065,It's hard to press charges on your own Grandma.
58066,"'See you in Court, Mildred'"
58067,"I’m working through a bottle of Eros. I still have mixed feelings about it. 

It’s definitely a loud scent, like anything Versace, people will notice it right away. Good or bad you will get a reaction. 

I like the scent but I’m not always in the mood for how bombastic it is. I don’t think it’s for everyone or all the time."
58068,"At Uni I discovered Chanel Allure Homme Sport and was the only guy I knew that wore it.

These 2 girls were talking to me at the bar one student night and they caught a whiff and basically buried their faces in to my neck while I stood there.

I became the amazing smelling guy to these women who would literally screech with glee, run over to me every time they saw me and just sniff my neck and sigh, without fail.  They'd tell other women and they'd smell me and agree and hang around etc.

Naturally this led to me getting laid left and right every week as it was such an easy in and convo started with these women...in my head anyway.  Totally didn't do anything with any of these women.  Another ""bruh"" moment in my memory bank my brain likes to recall randomly."
58069,these advertisements are getting gooder
58070,"Just posted about this scent. It's an absolute winner. Probably wouldn't be enough to get me laid fortunately as I'm a middle aged married bloke with a dad bod, but it's great to get compliments all the same."
58071,"Tom Ford Oud Wood usually gets me the most from women, but I normally wear BDC edp or parfum. The latter seems more popular with gay men though. Prada Luna Rossa was a big hit when I was \~19 but I don't know if they even make the original anymore"
58072,Ive gotten a fair amount of compliments from tobacco vanille by Tom Ford
58073,"I was about to comment after scrolling and did not see Tom Ford mentioned! I am a lady, and cannot get enough of the Oud Wood scent, I use it for myself too."
58074,"The Ombre Leather from Tom Ford is a damn miracle worker. I sometimes use it when I want my girlfriend to watch shows with me, and she ALWAYS buries her head into my chest where I've sprayed it :)"
58075,Ombré leather doesn’t fuck around
58076,This one right here. Ombré  Leather is intense but amazing.
58077,"Versace dylan blue, Dior sauvage edt, Montblanc explorer, Hugo boss bottled intense, 212 NYC for men"
58078,I got Dylan Blue from my wife and son for Father’s Day a few years back.  I thought it was pretty clever since my sons name is Dylan.  Turns out it is a terrific cologne.
58079,"Hahaha that is a pretty clever move! And I completely agree man, Dylan blue is definitely a fantastic scent... Versatile, fresh and clean and the longevity is great too! Glad you enjoy it!"
58080,Hugo Boss bottled has been my staple for years! love that cologne
58081,"Dudeeee yesss, such a beautiful sweet and seductive scent, the ladies love it! Shame it's discontinued though, definitely gonna grab a 100ML when I can!"
58082,Dior Sausage is one of my absolute favorites. There's another one I got in Colombia years ago that I haven't been able to find -- Dendur Zero
58083,"I can see the ad now...

Dior Sausage - Let her know what's on the menu."
58084,Eau de shlong
58085,Fucking awesome typo
58086,Ayyy Mont Blanc Explorer is my favorite currently
58087,"BIG yes to Dior Sauvage and all my girl friends feel the same. There are no words to describe how perfect that cologne is, if I smell it when I’m out there is a 100% chance I’m going to be sniffing my way to the wearer."
58088,"I have to co sign this. I used to use issey miyake for years, then I got sauvage and I've had co workers literally sniff me and ask what it was"
58089,So the important thing with cologne is not actually the smell. It is the compatibility with your skin. The same cologne can smell entirely different on other people. I found out some years ago the Eros from Versage is my go to cologne.
58090,">The same cologne can smell entirely different on other people.

Damn, I never knew this. Gotta keep this in mind in the future"
58091,"Yup, you should try putting cologne in your hand and smell it after 3 minutes to notice the real smell. Generally speaking from my observation sweet colognes don't fit well with oily skin."
58092,What kind of colognes go well with oily skin?
58093,"Three times now I've complimented a man's cologne it turned out to be Hawthorne. They have a site with a short questionnaire about your lifestyle & skin and serve you a semi-custom cologne for work and for nightlife. Not as fancy as the other brands listed in this thread but they seem to nail it every time.

Edit: they do soaps and other bathroom products now too but I have no reference for them. I'd assume they're decent quality."
58094,I like Hawthorne wipes too!
58095,Got a pocketful of hawthorns
58096,"I bought a sample pack online that came with 12 different samples for around $40. It let me try out some as a complete cologne newbie to see ones I liked and didn't like, without committing to a whole bottle. 

Also when I'm dating someone knew after a while we go through them together and pick out the ones she likes best. Different people have different preferences. And they can have associations to different scents depending if they knew someone else who used to wear it."
58097,"A friend of mine was hooking up with this guy, and she just loved his perfume, even telling me I should check it out because it was just that good in her opinion. 

Then one day her father bought a bottle of it, and she told me she ended up putting it at the back of her father's cologne shelf, and then after a month she just straight up took it. 

Couldn't have her father smelling like someone she was having sex with."
58098,Similar thing is exactly what made me add that last sentence. One woman immediately said one of the samples said it smelled like her uncle.
58099,"Yup, I've walked past women that smell like my father's 90+ year old aunt, a perfume that I absolutely hate and honestly makes me feel a bit sick. I practically can't get away from those people fast enough."
58100,I guarantee you they were wearing White Diamonds. That is such an old lady perfume
58101,Armani Diamonds or Armani Black Code
58102,Second for the Armani Code
58103,Third for Armani Code in the brown bottle.
58104,Armani Code Profumo 👌🏼
58105,"Chrome by Azzaro

And Aqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani

However, I just bought a new cologne and smells pretty damn good. It’s called “Mont Blanc Legend”. Highly recommend"
58106,Chrome has been my go to for like 20 years. Love it.
58107,Absolu acqua do gio is perfect for me. Give it a smell next time you’re looking
58108,"Chrome is a little golden nugget, pretty good and not too expensive.

Little pro tip though. If you're tired of spending so much on aqua di gio, check out 360 degree red by perry ellis. It's a very similar scent (often called a clone) and I think a 6.4oz bottle set me back like 40 bucks."
58109,Tom ford tabacoo and vanilla
58110,I think I vaped this flavour a few years ago
58111,D&G The One. It’s actually the only cologne that I have consistently used for the last 10 years. My sense of smell and preference changes quite a bit and I usually get burned out on any particular cologne and have to switch it up. The One is the only cologne that I finished a bottle of and then bought another bottle. I get a lot of compliments on it.
58112,My answer is well. Smells great. Just one pump needed. Lasts me a long long time.
58113,"L’Homme by YSL and Versace Eros are great. Perhaps a bit shameful, but one that does surprisingly well is Fierce by Abercrombie."
58114,Sex Panther. 60% of the time it works...Everytime.
58115,It smells like Bigfoot’s dick
58116,Is that the one with bits of real panther in it?
58117,That’s how you know it’s good.
58118,With notes of gasoline and indian food
58119,Really stings the nostrils!
58120,Issey Miyake and Bvlgari.
58121,Polo Black. Worn it for 20 years and still get longer embraces from the ladies
58122,Polo Double Black - my husband wears this one exclusively and i fricken love it!!
58123,"Invictus by Paco Rabbane. 

Trust me"
58124,"I was working as a security officer in an airport a few years ago and was stationed near the cologne-section of the taxfree. I had been looking for a new cologne for a while but couldent decide on which one. During one of the common, normal, and often boring perfume-discussions one of my coworkers bursted out: ""You know what? That Invictus smell makes me so fucking wet! It's almost embarassing how much i get turned on by it.""

Needless to say I went straight to the taxfree and bought it after my shift was done. No regrets."
58125,And????? Dont leave us with our dicks hanging out lol. What happened? Did she notice?
58126,I wear this to work sometimes and I've had 3 women ask me what it is so they could buy it for their partners which they all did
58127,My barber (a lady) used to constantly say I need to stop wearing it when getting my haircut as it makes her feel some kinda way.
58128,Ok this comment convinced me. I’m buying this cologne
58129,u/Ysghost1 you can attest to what a panty dropper Invictus is
58130,Invictus is the shiz!!!
58131,"Mmm my bf wears this, I agree!!!"
58132,I was about to say this. But I just wish the bottle would come with a cap or something so it doesn't release on accident when packed in a luggage.
58133,"Remember to buy a cologne that you actually think smells good also, nobody's going to be smelling it more than you. Well maybe that's not true considering you'll probably get used to it but you're definitely going to smell it every single morning when you put it on, and I've definitely came across the cologne so that make me wonder how in the F people actually want to buy it, let alone smell it"
58134,"I'm old school, I still use Calvin Klein Obsession."
58135,"Lynx Africa obviously ...

But realistically Replica Jazz Club by Maison Margiela"
58136,Creed Aventus and Creed Green Irish Tweed. Get a lot of compliments and lasts all day long.
58137,"I was looking g for this comment. Both if those scents are amazing! Aventus is my main go to scent, and then switch to tweed when I fancy a change."
58138,"Acqua Di Gio Profumo,
Bleu De Chanel EDP or Parfum,
Creed Aventus,
YSL Y EDP,
Rasasi Hawas,
Dolce & Gabanna The One EDP"
58139,I had a bottle of creed aventus once. It broke and spilled all over this back pack during a cross country road trip. That back pack smelled like that cologne for a solid 4 years...
58140,Creed Aventus ftw!
59357,Versace Eros
58142,Facts I’ve been wearing it lately
58143,Gucci guilty black
58144,Armani Aqcua di Gio Profumo.. Countless compliments!
58145,"For good reason, that thing is like heroin in an atomizer to me (a woman)."
58146,"Chanel Allure Edition Blanche, gotten many compliments over the years from both men and women"
58147,channel d allure homme sport is my personal favorite
58148,Creed Green Irish Tweed
58149,"Nothing fancy but Diesel: only the Brave (bottle shaped like a clenched fist) seems to be a firm favourite, often draws a compliment from my female friends."
58150,"I second this, been my go to for a while now."
58151,"Chanel Allure, Hermes d'terre, Tom Ford For Men, Issey Miyake."
58152,Allure Home Sport is my go-to and the only one I've ever been complimented on
58153,"**ACQUA DI GIÒ PROFUMO** by Giorgio Armani. It is very versatile, thus usable in every season and during every occasion. And my female acquaintances love it. The scent is very fresh, harsh, and manly.

&#x200B;

**STRONGER WITH YOU** by Emporio Armani. This is an amazing ""cuddle-cologne"". Though it is not as versatile in terms of all year round, yet a fabulous scent during the fall and winter. But during these seasons you can wear it pretty much during every occasion, especially the one I listed above. The scent itself is very sweet and soft."
58154,"I’ve worn a number of different ones over the yrs.

But Eternity by Calvin Klein is the one that always gets compliments from the women i date."
58155,D&G light blue or powder blue. Something like that. Idk my wife bought it for me.
58156,"I love Light Blue but people close to me have said they don't really like it, so I mostly just wear it for myself."
58157,It's a refreshing scent. I usually use it during the day as feels like to me a very chill time. Like how a crisp beach should smell like.
58158,"Oh, Bvlgari pour Homme Soir is absolutely sexy"
58159,Eau Sauvage - Dior
58160,"Oh there's numerous.

* ZARA Vibrant Leather Eau De Parfum (pro tip, smells extremely similar to Creed Aventus, but is literally 1/10th the cost).
* Chanel Allure Homme Sport (why there's no parfum version of this I'll never know, this stuff doesn't last more than 2 hours tops)
* Yves Saint Laurent, L'Homme
* Dior Sauvage
* Montblanc Explorer (personal fave)
* Yves Saint Laurent, La Nuit De L'Homme

It's worth shelling out for one or two a few times a year, but get the parfum versions if you can.  More intense and last longer."
58161,"Fuck cologne its all about that fabric softener shit, if you smell like clean laundry thats been hung in the backyard by your swiss grandma, i am immediately attaching myself to you"
58162,Iiiiiiits a Tide ad! Lol
58163,"Póds, by Tidé"
58164,"Dior Sausage is my most complimented. Then Dylan blue, La Nuit de L’Homme and Y by YSL are also good"
