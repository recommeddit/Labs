40955,"> percussion [...] are easy to play

Depends on what percussion. It took me literally two weeks before I got a reliable single stroke out of the tablas."
40956,"In a way, yes. If your looking to become pro, then you need to learn a wide array of instruments. 

The question was just 1 instrument though, and learning a single percussion instrument is alot easier then most others. 

Other then a full drum kit (which is hard for sure), you dont have to over think most of the process, whereas while playing something like a piano, you have to be mindful of the note selection in both hands, syncopation, patterns, rhythm and the sight reading. 

It may be subjective but I know which one is more challenging for me haha"
40957,"it’s definitely subjective lol but for me i know that snare drum, timpani, and mallets were all much harder for me to become proficient at than  piano or cello. timpani is probably the most difficult instrument i’ve played honestly"
40958,"That's actually quite nice to hear, I like the differences we all have :) 

As I said in my very first comment, I connect with strings best as its what I'm most familiar with so maybe it's just having less exposure to percussion instruments. 

Either way, cool discussion"
40959,"lol yeah cool discussion, and I find it important that people value percussionists do. A lot of what we play is a lot more complex than at first glance."
40960,"I totally do not undervalue percussionists, I was simply stating that if you want one single instrument to learn that would be easier, one percussion instrument would be alot easier then many others. Learning a variety of percussion is different then one singular instrument. 

Theres also a huge difference between learning an instrument to play and playing at a professional level"
40961,"That's where you are still mistaken. It is not just the number of instruments that makes percussion difficult. Even specialising in just one instrument is difficult, for instance any of these: snare drum, timpani, marimba, vibraphone, tambourine.

People underestimate how much goes into learning to hit something to produce a good sound."
40962,"I’ve read the whole thread and I’m glad you’re sticking up for percussion instruments but I’m completely unconvinced. Every instrument requires years of technique training before you can evens think about playing properly, and I find it extremely difficult to believe that properly mastering technique on a timpani takes longer than doing the same on guitar, clarinet or cello. And the tonal instruments have entire layers of complexity on top of that which really aren’t present in a timpani. 

Personally I’ve struggled to learn guitar for more than a decade, but have recently picked up drums and have found that quite easy in comparison. Nonetheless, I am certain that I would have found drums much more of a struggle had I not internalised a certain (very modest) amount of rhythm from the guitar."
40963,"Can you make your double strokes rolls sound like single stroke rolls at all tempos from 30bpm to 240bpm at various dynamic levels from soft to loud? Can you play triplets and consistently hit rim shots, without playing loudly, on every single first note? Can you at will choose to hit rim shots in different ways to make them sound differently, and do so consistently as though you were just choosing piano keys to press? Can you play a paradidlde pattern in triplets and make it sound like you are just playing a single stroke roll? What is the purpose of paradiddles? What is the difference between Gladstone technique and Moeller technique and is it possible to combine them? Can you flip your stick between matched grip and traditional grip in half a second consistently without dropping your stick? Can you play in both matched grip and traditional grip? Can you insert flams into your patterns without compromising the rhythmic integrity? Do you ever mute your drums with your hand? What are the different spots on a drum where you can hit and how does it affect the response and sound? Can you do an even buzz roll and vary the dynamics? Can you drum non-stop for two hours frequently without getting carpal tunnel syndrome? You have barely scratched the surface."
40964,I don’t think it’s fair at all to say that Timpani is equivalent to Cello or piano. That’s such an overstatement.
40965,I agree fully but I’m very curious about what tambourine techniques you might be referring to
40966,hahah getting smooth and consistent shake rolls/taps and thumb rolls are what i was referencing
40967,"I’m not sure if the Brazilian pandeiro would be classified as a tambourine for these purposes, but there’s a whole lot of technique that goes into playing that."
40969,triangle?
40970,"> Classical strings dont have any note indicators or frets which leads to the problem you mentioned above. The layout of these instruments is much friendlier though.

You make it sound like they're easier than guitar!  

Firstly, the question of the ""layout"" is debatable - I'd say the frets make guitar easier, although the mixed tuning (4ths and one 3rd) gets confusing for patterns.   
But the main thing with classical strings is the *bowing*.  That's a lot harder to learn just hitting the strings with your fingers (or a pick).   Violin in particular sounds terrible while you're learning - a combination of poor intonation and clumsy bowing - while guitar's frets mean at least you can play in tune (if not in key...).

There's also an argument for guitar that its fretboard is a better guide for how intervals and scales work (up one string) than a keyboard, with its misleading white-black distinctions.  Otherwise, piano is obviously a lot easier technically; and bigger range and better for theory.  (And the white-black distinction is at least historically informative, as well as perfectly suited to staff notation.)


Excellent summary otherwise. :-)"
40971,"Just to clear this out, I didn't say guitar is harder or easier then classical strings. The layout I mentioned was aimed at the string tuning (4ths and one 3rd) which is a horrible layout for anyone who is using it to learn theory. 

After so much time on both instruments I cannot personally understand how a guitar could be better for scales and intervals then a guitar, but both our opinions here are biased and subjective over preference."
40972,Guitar is tricky with the mixed tuning. But you could absolutely make an argument that scales and intervals are easier to learn on bass (which is all 4ths) than piano.
40973,"> I cannot personally understand how a guitar could be better for scales and intervals then a guitar

I guess the second ""guitar"" is a typo for ""piano"".  ;-)

What I meant was that the fret pattern shows you the scale structure.  On piano, the notes ABCDEFGA are all evenly spaced - visually on the keyboard.  The black notes look like a kind of afterthought (which is what I meant by the keyboard being ""historically informative"").  On guitar (on the A string) you see the 2-1-2-2-1-2-2 fret pattern.  The guitar is not biased towards C major / A minor.  

Also, the guitar makes a good test bed for demonstrating the harmonic series, and the mathematical basis of perfect intervals.  Again, working with one string only.  (And bowed strings would be just as good for that, seeing as the frets are kind of misleading, being in equal temperament.)

Otherwise - yes, for theory, the piano wins hands down. :-)  (Ha, ""hands down"", literally! :-D)"
40974,"Wow, this was a really thorough and thoughtful post."
40975,"Thank you :) I always try to connect with musicians and people passionate with music as best as I can. 

No one knows everything, we are all learning and growing musically together!"
40977,"One particular instrument stands out to me that not many take seriously. The Baroque Recorder is an extremely simple instrument, though perhaps not quite as simple as percussion. It has less holes than you have fingers and with no reed, it doesnt require much breath control to play."
40978,A kazoo
40979,An ukulele is a good place to start. Its easy to pick up a couple songs quick.
40980,"A lot of people here are saying Piano, to which I agree, but a Transverse Ocarina is also pretty easy; you just gotta be stable with your breath."
40981,"Gotta say though, the rabbit hole is real. I've got 4 ocarinas since I started a while ago. 6, if you count the shitty ones I started out with."
40982,"Finally a fellow Ocarina player! Yeah the rabbit hole very real, it gets hard to hold myself back sometimes on not buying an Ocarina when I need the funds for other things.

Someday, I'll buy that Spencer Virtuoso..."
40983,"I'm going to go with ukulele. Small fretboard, easy chords, four strings, portable, relatively cheap, sounds pleasant (even if you don't know what you're doing)."
40984,I'm an advocate that the voice is an instrument and is the most organic to the body. Exploring this and getting in tune with yourself as a musician will make any extension (any other instrument) much easier than without this process. I would suggest picking something that really calls to you.
40985,"The kazoo, recorder or triangle would probably be up there."
40986,"Surprised nobody here has said euphonium (or baritone horn for those wondering, aka mini tuba).

Very forgiving, by far easiest brass instrument to sound good on and easy to produce sound because of the mouthpiece size."
40987,"Scrolled trying to find if anyone said euphonium. 

In my opinion, euphonium is an instrument that can easily be picked up as a first brass instrument. The mouthpiece size is a sweet spot for a beginner brass player, and a typical student model only has 3 valves. In elementary school, I started as a trumpet player, and cried every day for the first week. Euphonium was the perfect switch for me. It can read treble or bass clef, and the fingerings are relatively simple.

Euphonium models vary in what size mouthpiece they accept. Beginner models primarily use small shank while professional models use medium (european), and large shank. The second two (especially large) are much less forgiving for a beginning musician as they require a large amount of air to make a good sound.

Baritone and Euphonium get used interchangeably, however they are different instruments. A baritone has a bell more similar to a trombone (cylindrical), while euphonium has a bell that has a more gradual growth to it like a tuba (conical). The american style Euphonium has a forward facing bell, and is often mistaken for a baritone.

Student model euphoniums can be had for relatively cheap, and many find it easy to make a sound on it. When you first start off, your tone is pretty trombone like, but eventually progresses to a full rich sound that is sought after as a euphonium player. Yamahas are a safe bet as quality control is consistent with the horns. The YEP 201 has 3 valves, and the 321 has 4. Both take a small shank mouthpiece, and don't require too much air.

I mentioned it a little bit above, but getting a sound is pretty easy on Euphonium. However the idea of instant tone is frustrating to me. Some people assume that the instrument takes no skill to become proficient at. Proper air support is needed, and you have to listen to someone to understand what to look for in your tone as a euphonium player. You fill a unique role in the band where you might be holding it down with the other low brass, and then a few measures later, you're playing a running line with the woodwinds.

Euphonium is rarely found outside of the wind band setting, but it does make an appearance in orchestra pieces. Gustav Holst wrote for Tenor Tuba in the Planets Suite, and the solo in Mars gives me chills every time. You can also find euphonium in jazz. Rich Matteson is one of the greatest musicians I've ever heard. He was able to prove that the instrument has a voice outside of the standard concert band environment.

One of the downsides (I see this as a perk haha) is that not many people know what this instrument is. I've been called a tuba (Euphonium is part of the tuba family as the tenor tuba), french horn, saxophone,  and trombone. It's a nice conversation starter as a lot of people are curious about what it actually is.

This is my 9th year on the instrument, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. It's very rewarding to learn, and quite forgiving for a beginning musician."
40988,"The easiest instrument is the saxophone, albeit difficult to get a full mastery of, but the embrochure is simple to grasp and is easy to make a sound on."
40989,"the triangle, you just have to know when, thats all"
40990,"Piano, by far.

It requires zero skill to produce a good sound on a piano, unlike the flute, trumpet, saxophone, viola... Lots of instruments require a fair amount of practice just to make *a* sound, let alone a *good* sound.

The piano is also more visual than other instruments. Every note looks unique and is easy to remember and identify. Not true with most other instruments.

That said, playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy. But learning it is. There's a reason most music schools require piano proficiency for every student, regardless of their principal instrument."
40991,"> playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy

To expand on this, the big reason is because piano is so easy that being able to play it at a high level just has you doing *so much*. I mean, aside from other finger keyboards like it, what other instruments are able to do what pianos can do at the efficiency and ease you can with a piano? Just off the top of my head:

1. Moving around super thick jazz chords with all manner of extensions

2. Playing a smooth 4-part harmony with relatively independent lines

3. Playing a melody, chords, and a (relatively) complex baseline all at once"
40992,"In addition to this, also consider the point made by u/kirakun in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/jpixsy/easiest_instrument_to_play/gbfdyo3/).

The piano is good at playing many notes. But when you play a single note, the degree of control is constrained to just the initial action and the release of the key. Hence the expressive potential of a single note is limited compared to say the violin or the clarinet. When you play *more* notes, this limitation starts to fade away because by playing more notes you have more instances of the initial key action and the key release each of which gives you the chance to inject expression into the playing. For piano playing, it's almost as though *more is better*. Can you imagine playing only the melody of *Amazing Grace* on the piano with no accompaniment nor embellishment and still make it sound expressive? Maybe just a little. But [on the trumpet](https://youtu.be/qhTZpjayF_s?t=95), it's a different thing altogether."
40993,"Agreed, although you could argue it as a high-risk-high-reward type deal for the brass instruments. There are things that pro trumpet players can't accomplish on their instrument that any piano novice can do passably well, but the corollary of that is that when a pianist plays a trumpet piece verbatim it sounds like a novice.

As a brass player myself (I know, real subtle clue in my username), I'll often just for the hell of it take the pieces I'm trying to learn and play them on piano, and unless it has a bunch of really fast 16th runs or something of the sort I'll have mastered it within 10 minutes. And I'm not even remotely good at piano."
40994,nutty ass example on the wynton marsalis clip
40995,"Hmm... I never really considered the ultimate complexity of piano to be the result of its relative ease to play initially.

It's an interesting point, but I'd argue that it's more the result of the practical capabilities of the instrument.

You can't play multiple independent lines on a miniMoog, for example (because it's monophonic). You can do so on the pedal harp, but you can't play note clusters."
40996,5. Getting pounded into insanity trying to learn ligeti etudes where you have to play 4 different polyrhythmic metres spread between two tonally distinct presto scales.
40997,"I think the main difference is the learning curve. Piano is easier because you can produce a good sound straight away and you make huge progress at the beginning. Then it becomes way harder and practicing hard pieces takes a lot of time, sometimes more than other instruments. In fact, pianists are known to be among the ones who practice the most hours. Other instruments require less hours of daily practice.... But that's not because they are easier maybes just that they tire you more and it's not useful to play more.

Piano compares to other instruments is also more versatile and pianists are required to have a lot of different skills: from being a soloist to an accompanist to a collaborative pianist etc. This means also perfecting sight reading and learning pieces in a short amount of time which becomes definitely harder and time consuming than for example a wind instrument.

And in the end, trascendental technique is very hard to achieve and especially to maintain: you either practice a lot everyday or you lose every fluency you had. And perfecting the touch is very hard, especially since you have to play on different instruments. The potential mistakes are a lot, I feel like it's easier to mess up blatantly playing piano because mistakes are easily recognizable.

That being said all instruments are difficult, some at the begging, others at the end, and if you want to play seriously you have to put a huge amount of effort into it which includes also studying scores, theory etc."
40998,">In fact, pianists are known to be among the ones who practice the most hours. Other instruments require less hours of daily practice

That's a big ""citation needed"" claim, right there"
40999,"Ahaha you are right
It was more the way I have always felt in conservatory. Especially preparing exams. In the end, at high level, professionals all spend the same time practicing and studying."
41000,"getting past the stage of making random squeaks having, having basic control on the bow, and being in tune was definitely harder than the first months of playing piano."
41001,An instrument that sounds nice to your ear will be more enjoyable to play and inspire more practice.
41002,"Difficulty is a multidimensional thing.

You can get a nice tone from a piano rather easily, but to find the correct notes, or even fitting ones with all 10 fingers at once (or in rapid succession) is a whole other story.

Then on the other end of that spectrum there´s the violin, on which you have to master some rather complicated techniques just to get one decent tone, but on the other hand aren´t expected to do the harmonic maths required for the piano - at least not to that extent.

Then there are instruments that are easier to play but also rather limited in their tonal possibilities, like pentatonic dulcimers or the irish tin whistle. The latter has a catch though: It is made for playing in the keys irish music traditionally uses, and makes playing fast in these keys relatively easy. On the other hand that speed, and the rapid embellishments are expected in irish music."
41003,"In my experience: Piano. If you can type on a keyboard, you can play the piano. (Play=/= play well). I learned to play (not master) the piano relatively quick because I found it fun, which is probably why it was easier to learn than other instruments for me."
41004,"There is no ""easiest instrument."" They're all challenging in their own unique ways, though it is true that the more instruments you learn, the easier it becomes to pick up new ones. 

That being said, here are my opinions:

Easiest rock instrument: drum kit because you don't have to worry about pitch very much

Easiest orchestra instrument: probably also drums

Easiest marching band instrument: cymbals

Easiest overall: if a kazoo counts, it's totally the easiest. There's lots of small mouth instruments that are pretty easy such as pitch pipes, harmonicas, and Jew harps

Easiest string instrument: gonna go with picked electric bass"
41005,Playing drums (with a full kit) *well* is way harder than playing bass competently (enough for a rock band) IMO.
41006,As a bassist I have to agree. You can play so many types of rock music with bass just by long notes in verses and 8th notes in chorus. Maybe with a few extra notes in between. So many bands seem to have just put the kid with least amount of skill playing instruments on the bass and it shows looking through a lots of bands repertoire.
41007,Have you ever played the drums before?
41008,As a drummer I’d say that playing drums isn’t hard. Getting a basic beat and a few fills is pretty easy. Being a good drummer is very hard though.
41009,"I've played the drums for 14 years, but I could have been the drummer for AC/DC in less than a year of learning. Starting is very simple. The most important thing is not rushing out dragging. However, the ceiling is incredibly high because you have people like Danny Carey who as insane limb independence and also uses snare solo music to practice double bass."
41010,"Lol, AC/DC ain't that high of a standard."
41011,"That's my point. Entry level drums aren't too bad, but the range of skill is insane."
41012,"In my experience getting a good sound on a drumkit usually takes way longer than on guitar,bass or piano for beginners. Most people just hit the drums and it doesn't sound tight or musical at all. For most drummers it takes a couple of years before you could actually play a song without sounding like a complete beginner."
41013,"The same could be said about any instrument, I think. But yeah the snares especially are notorious for their difficult set up"
41014,I’m really surprised I had to scroll this far to find electric bass. It has a reputation for being the instrument you stick your friend who knows nothing about music on because most pop music is really simple on bass.
41015,Bass drum is way easier than cymbals.
41016,"Kalimba. Most only use diatonic notes so you can pretty much randomly move your thumbs around and it’ll sound fine. Accidentally hit two notes next to each other? They’re all a third apart, so that’s fine too. You can also get them in pentatonic tunings for even less chance to sound weird."
41017,"Saxophone. It’s very responsive, and the fingerings are the easiest to learn of any woodwind. Plus there’s so much popular music that includes saxes, so there’s plenty of music to play for fun. If clarinet was easy for you, sax will be even easier. I’ve played clarinet for over a decade, gotten a degree in music performance on clarinet. I’ve played sax for half as long and haven’t studied it as intensely, and can do just as much if not more on sax than clarinet. It’s just a very forgiving instrument."
41018,"If we are counting midi. I say the drum pad controller is easiest because you can basically remap your buttons to have the same pathway while trigger a different sound. and edit audio to be as long or short as you want, can loop what you want or not at all. Have one button play chord or have to play each note separately."
41019,I’d say drums in terms of just starting to be able to play ... Mastering drums is a whole entire other level of dedication and artistry tho
41020,"When I was in a garage band in high school, everyone loved to fuck around on the drums when we took a break...I think everyone in the band could play a basic rock beat."
41021,"I love switching around instruments with my friends. Most everyone can play bass and drums, and a few of us know geetar and piano too. It makes for the most fun just switching around after every song. Keeps the vibes fresh and the brains sharp. Get the band back together dude! We want to hear you rock!!!"
41022,The Kazoo for sure
41023,"Harmonicas are relatively easy. They are all tuned to a key and if you can figure out how to tongue block and play one note at a time, you’re halfway to making it sound pretty good. There a big step between Bob Dylan and John Popper though."
41024,"Harmonicas are easy to get the basics of (pick a key, pick a hole, breathe) but their limited nature makes playing more complicated stuff much harder. You can play 3 octaves fully chromatically on a diatonic harmonica if you master bends and overblows. Hole 3 alone has 6 notes available.

Sure, chromatic harmonicas exist specifically for this reason, but people enjoy the sound of diatonic harps too much to make the switch."
41025,It's kinda crazy to me how much the diatonicity (is that a word?) of the harmonica (or blues harp more specifically) contributes to how I perceive its sound. I was probably in my late teens or early 20s before I realized that *that sound* on all those Stevie Wonder songs was actually a harmonica and not some flavor of woodwind.

41029,"Not true, there’s so much aim involved and people are so mean when you miss"
41030,"Keyboard instruments are very approachable because you can just press the key and it makes the sound you want

To make a good sound on wind instruments or string instruments, it takes some technique and practice. For fretless string instruments, you also need to learn and practice being in tune

In contrast to that, you always keep the same hand position with wind instruments, unlike piano where you might have big jumps and have to play with both hands

I don't think you can really pick an easiest instrument to play, as naturally, players and composers always push the limits of what's possible on the instrument so all instruments can be very difficult

You could probably day what instrument is the most approachable/easiest at the start"
41031,"My first instrument was the ukulele. I’ve been playing it for over 2 years now and I find it really easy. Beginning is the hardest part but hearing of your experience with cello, I think you could pick it up quickly.

After you get the finger positions down for chords and learn how to strum properly you’ll start learning real quick. It’s a really underrated instrument in my opinion. 

The only concern I would bring up about it is the size. Watch some reviews and see what would best fit your hands. I personally like the tenor better than the soprano because it’s easier to hold and the size allows the sound to resonate more. The soprano can congest your fingers on the fretboard.

I also think guitar is easy but I have limited experience with it. (My family owns one but I’m a bass player.) I know some chords and can improvise decently enough but that’s due to my experience with uke. They’re very similar instruments. 

You can even go in between and get a baritone ukulele which has the same tuning as the highest 4 strings of the guitar (D G B E lowest to highest) and is larger than the tenor. 

And finally, about the ukulele tuning. It’s standard tuning is G C E A with the C as the lowest note. If you don’t like the limited range these notes provide or the high to low to high tuning it offers, then you can easily find a set of strings with a low G so the notes rise lowest to highest consistently, like other instruments. I personally like the low G tuning best as it adds more options for finger picking and provides some bass and fullness in the chords. It’s also fun to see people’s reaction when showing them something non traditional."

41035,"People are forgetting the one instrument most any person can play. The voice! Most of us have some practice making noise with our mouthes. It's really hard to master, but most of us got more control over that than any other instrument."
41036,"If you want to play an instrument to enjoy playing, piano would get my vote.

BUT.....

Get a chord book and a ""fake book"" and learn to read simple lead sheet.  That's probably your easiest and shortest path to success on the piano.  Most piano hobbyists are quite happy with this level of skill and proficiency..... and it helps at parties.

However, if you want to be technically proficient or play classical, piano has a VERY large skill gap. Performing at a high level is extremely difficult.  The phrase, ""a minute to learn, a lifetime to master"" is particularly true with piano."
41037,"Guitar is easier than piano in that transposition doesn’t require you to memorize entirely new fingering patterns. The downside is that finger go ouchie sometimes. 

I think uke is harder than guitar even though finger no go ouchie because the tuning goes down a fifth, up a third, then up a fourth, which makes it waaaay more confusing to learn scales and intervals, whereas guitar is up fourths, up a third, then up another fourth."
41038,"I took an interest in all sorts of instruments in high school. I never got the chance to be taught but I figured it out via Youtube and some very patient musician friends. After dabbling with the trumpet, stand up bass, piano, xylophone and all things drumline; I found that the guitar was the easiest. First learning fundamentals on the bass, I got good enough within a year to try the electric guitar. I feel like it’s the easiest because tabs can be picked up way faster than standard notation. Learn some basic chords, buy a capo and you can string out a ton of songs very early. The quick gratification really kept my head in practice mode."
41039,What is a capo?. thanks
41040,"I’m only 15 but a couple years ago I became very interested in music and began to teach myself how to play piano, I’m now learning how to play guitar as well. But piano was incredibly easy for me"

41044,"Pipe organ? Nah. Surely one keyboard is easier than multiple, and having no keyboard to play with your feet (without seeing well or at all) is easier than having one."
41045,Haha I was joking
41046,Good :D
41047,"This isn't the only factor, but I think a major part of it is the gap between first picking up the instrument and being able to play something identifiable as music. The shorter the gap, the more likely you are to stick with the instrument long enough to become proficient."
41048,"Huh.  Well, there’s two major points for this argument usually.  Which instrument is the easiest to learn to play, and which instrument is the easiest to actually get good at.  Piano is the easiest to learn basic skills on.  One straight line of keys that rise in pitch as you go from left to right.  Just about anyone can learn a couple basic songs on piano given a few weeks.  (Not a feat you could learn on say, a wind instrument, where you’d struggle to make so much as a consistent sound).  The easiest to get good at comes down to natural physiology (at least for winds).  Mouths are built certain ways, some instruments will come more naturally than others.  This extends to advanced skills."
41049,"Yeah, I'd say piano/synth. Anything keys."
42440,Triangle.
41051,"In my opinion, there is no answer to this generally, as practice time is directly correlated to improvement on every instrument.

Now I will say if you're want to narrow the question a bit to something like, ""what instrument will let me play [genre] songs with the least time investment"", that changes things. I used to teach a rock camp for kids and I've had 6 year olds drumming AC/DC in a couple weeks without prior experience. It's not mastery or getting particularly ""good"" but they can certainly jam to the ol' 1 and 3."
41052,didgeridoo
41054,"As a bass player, honestly I think that bass, specifically electric bass, is the easiest instrument to learn to play. You only have to worry about playing one note at a time, and you have frets to keep your notes in tune (assuming you're instrument is set up properly, and you've tuned it). 

Bass rhythms vary widely, but if you have a competent drummer, it's easy enough to follow the bass drum, or a paired down version of the bass drum rhythm. I'm speaking about modern contemporary and pop music of course. 

Mostly the rhythms are 1 to 3 notes per measure, making the rhythms very easy, along with the fretting of the notes really. But, everyone is different in their own learning styles. 

Some people may think the keys of a trumpet are easier, but to me there are more movements involved in a brass, or woodwind, instrument than in a string instrument. With wind instruments you have to shape your mouth as well as play the right keys to get the proper notes. With stringed instruments, especially ones where the strings are plucked (bass, guitar, etc.) you only need to remember where the notes are played, not the shape of your mouth, despite what guitarists look like when they're crushing a solo 😉

TL;DR: bass guitar is easiest, imo."
41055,The ease comes with your resolve.
41056,"No-one has said electric bass yet.

I would definitely consider it in the running as what you're actually required to play in order to contribute to an ensemble is easier than any other instrument"
41057,"I play piano and my friend is a violist. I was commenting to him how surreal I thought it was that he has to create the note by remembering exact finger positions on the strings while bowing rather just hitting a specific key. He responded that he had no idea how I was able to  read and play two lines of music simultaneously. 

I don’t think one is necessarily easier than the others - they all have their complexities!"
41058,The Triangle
41059,Your voice.
41060,Harmonica. You can't hit a wrong note if it's played solo
41061,"If we're comparing like for like, surely the piano. You can probably learn ""Twinkle twinkle little star"" with one hand on the piano in less time than it takes to learn how to get sound from a clarinet.

But because it's so easy, the expectations are higher: A piano player is not only expected to play a single tune like most other instruments, but also to provide any additional voices, a bass line, and their own accompaniment. That's what makes it hard, you're basically doing the job of what would take four people in a string quartet all on your own.

Other contenders for easiest instrument:

* Recorder: Very simple to make sound; unlike most other wind instruments there's no special trick to it, just blow. No extra keywork to learn. Simple and fairly logical fingering in the first octave. But in the upper register it's less easy: Inconsistent fingering that bears little resemblance to the lower register, half-holing the thumb hole with a gap that needs to vary in size depending on which note you want, and you need to carefully calibrate the breath pressure to avoid squeaking (took me a couple of months to learn as an adult).
* Guitar: Simple to learn a few chords and sing along. Very simple to transpose in semitone steps (with a capo). But if you want to play the guitar like a piano, with melody and accompaniment at the same time, it's harder than piano.

You can appoint an ""easiest"" instrument only by arbitrarily restricting the comparison: Easiest learning to play the ""twinkle, twinkle"" melody in C major? Piano and recorder are close, I guess a few minutes for both, but I think piano wins from the visual feedback. (Hardest is probably fretless string instruments like violin, going from zero to an in-tune ""twinkle, twinkle"" could take months.) 

Easiest to transpose by a semitone? Guitar wins by a mile. 

Easiest to transpose by an octave? Piano, no contest. 

Easiest to learn to play the melody _and_ the accompaniment? Not all that easy on piano (i.e. it will take more than a few minutes), but for recorder or clarinet it's impossible, and while the guitar can do it it's harder to understand what you are doing, so piano wins.

But if you want to play at expert level, it's going to be hard with any instrument. Simply because experts have spent years practicing, and if playing a basic melody is too simple they'll add complexity elsewhere.
 
I have played piano and guitar (a few years), recorder (a few months), and clarinet (a week), so I have primarily commented on the instruments I've actually played."
41062,"So I'm a keyboard novice, but I find its relatively simple to get started and an okay amateur keyboard (no weighted keys or anything) is pretty cheap. If you have the space, unlike me, people throw away pianos all the time, but if you're limited on space and funds then a keyboard might be your best bet.

I've also playesld the ukulele, but imo keyboard is more fun."
41063,"Piano definitely. Is not easier than the others at all, but you have a lot of advantages:

1. It is visual friendly

Right goes up
Down goes down
And that's it

2. Technic

You can improve your technic skills during all your lifetime, but you push, it sounds
And that's it

3. Balanced price

You can take a very good electronic piano that will be with you for many years (if you be careful) for 360 euros. I have had the Yamaha P-85 for 6 years. And it is in perfect conditions.

4. The great MIDI

With the MIDI system you will be able to record not even the best piano ever, but any instrument (in a superior quality). You will be able to play a harp, drums, flute, and the sound of a helicopter. Literally what you want

5. You can play at night

You can use headphones! With the violin, drums, trumpet, you can't. You can change the volume.

6. Not the best transportation but you can carry it easily

With the correct case you can transport it. It is not the most comfortable instrument to carry but it is possible.

7. With a electronic one (i recommend you that one) you don't have to tune it!

It is expensive to tune it (I'm sorry tuners, i know it is a very experience and dedicate, and delicate work) and your ear trains better (since it is always perfectly tune). Also, you can tune another instrument having this reference.

8. Clefs

You will learn to read in the 2 most common clefs

9. You have a lot of sheet music wrote for piano, more than banjo, flute and bassoon.

I guess I have a few more reasons but it is enough now. All the instruments are beautiful. I only recommend you one to start. It is easier to study theory too.

I'm a piano professor and I love it.

I wish you the best with any decision!!!

:)"
41064,Reeds make me sneeze
41065,"I play violin and piano. It is sure easy to pick up the piano. (no, not litteraly) but on an higher level they are both very difficult."
41066,Uke for sure then Bass guitar
41067,"As a pianist I may be biased, but I’d say any keyboard instruments are the easiest to learn as they have all notes displayed in a methodical and visually simple way. That said, mastering any instrument is a completely different matter!"
41068,Diatonic harmonica - there's no bad notes; all you to do is breathe rhythmically.
41069,"Fretted instruments are much easier to play properly than fretless.

My vote for ""easiest"" is something like a xylophone. Perhaps a drum kit.

Ultimately it doesn't matter because what you have to matter is rhythm, harmony and melody and it's the same for any instrument."
41070,"Hand drums for sure. Cajon, bongos, conga, even just a snare. Percussion instruments are the best and easiest rudimentary instruments to learn. Heck, even the table or your leg can become an instrument."
41071,Probably piano. It's one of few I can think of that doesn't require skill to not sound bad playing a single note. Not to take away from it of course - its lack of expression makes great piano music even more impressive. But most other instruments you can expect to sound pretty terrible for a considerable period of time.
41072,"Easiest instrument to play at a basic, competent level? 


Bass. By a considerable amount. You only need to mirror the root of a chord and you're doing your job

(I'm a bass player btw. It does get more complicated as it goes. But bass will give you that instant gratification of being able to play one note per bar and be ""doing your job"")"
41073,"I am also a bass player and I agree, but plenty of people ignorantly chalk up bass as just the ""easy guitar"" and give no credit to what it takes to actually *be* a bass player, not just *play the bass*."
41074,I can play intermediate piano and advanced guitar. Because of the lockdown I ordered a bass guitar last week. I'm having so much fun because it's an instrument I can just pick up and am able to play many songs instantly. For me it feels more like a rythmic instrument than a guitar.
41075,"As a guitar player who transitioned over to bass for the sake of landing a spot in a gigging band, I find I enjoy practicing bass and performing much more than guitar. I feel like a part of the music a lot more, I really feel the groove and timing when playing bass in a way I never did when playing guitar. It makes me think I was playing the wrong instrument all this time :(

Guitar seems disposable as an instrument in this day and age... I have seen really amazing contemporary bands that don't even have a guitar at all. It is very refreshing."
41076,"I am 25, have played drums since I was 9, guitar since 13, piano since 14, violin since 18 and saxophone since 22 and have reached proficiency in all of them to the point that I have performed and recorded all of them professionally (i.e. in exchange for $$$) and the easiest to reach a standard of playing worth performing on its own was saxophone, followed by piano, drums, guitar and violin. In terms of reaching a technical level sufficient to perform respectably in a group the list is probably guitar, piano, drums, saxophone, violin."
41077,"Guitar, if only for the sheer volume of resources you can find online.  That makes it an easier journey for sure."
41078,Auto harp for sure.  Just push a button and strum.  Also bass guitar is super easy to learn.
41079,"Nothing beats a piano for ease and playability. You never need to think about how to actually make a note sound. You hit the key and it sounds. Even with easier fretted instruments, sometimes your finger is in the wrong place and you don't get a sound."
41080,"I would definitely say guitar. I’m a drummer and have gone down multiple paths with different instruments. Uke or mandolin are a bit easier initially, but I got bored with them much faster. Guitar will be a more rewarding long term relationship and is really easy to learn the basics since it’s mostly muscle memory and finger strength. Teach yourself the G C E Am D and F chords and practice changing between them until your fingers hurt too bad to continue 3-4 days in a row. Then you’ll basically be able to play a few songs. And can worry about learning scales and more complex chords later."
41081,Yeah to pick up and learn some beginner stuff it is accessible but to get *good* at it is another story. Guitar is VERY mechanically intensive at the high level.
41082,"I see people saying the uke, and I've heard that, but like others have also said, there's differrnt levels of conplexity. The basic chords of the uke are fairly simple to get down, but i know some people take the uke to the next level with finger picking and percussive techniques.

However, I've also heard (though i can't attest to this as I dont play it) that the ocarina is the easiest instrument to learn. But then again, there are different kinds with different amounts of holes, so i guess it would depend what you get. And also how far you decide to take it"
41083,The autoharp. Just press the buttons and strum. It creates the chords for you.
41084,"The triangle, you just hit it and it go ding"
41085,I think it is the harmonica. It's easy to get the sound out of it and no fingers are used in a coordinated way like piano or trumpet.
41086,"I know this is a music theory sub, but you don’t need to learn music theory to play the drums at a basic level. More advanced drumming turns into a whole lot of “theory” like stuff though, I like to think of it as rhythm theory."
41088,"I took up guitar because I needed something to relax with after violin practice.  It became my primary.  I took up the uke because of Amanda Palmer and Grace Vanderwall. 

Uke is easy because it’s fun. 

To me the easiest instrument to play is the one you’ve learned to enjoy practicing on.  If practice is enjoyable and we keep the instrument ready to hand, then things become easy.  I’ve spent enough time with a guitar that the uke was just a 3 stringed guitar with an extra weird string. Everything already “worked” 

To me, what is easy is that which is enjoyable.  Technical difficulty only creates practice difficulty when it is frustrating. Ymmv"
41089,"Ukulele - it’s like a guitar, but you don’t really get callouses and you don’t have to stretch your fingers in weird ways"
41090,Piano is a great one to learn since it will teach you to read music well.
41091,"Plus, the piano keyboard is a super-versatile songwriting tool when matched with your favorite DAW."
41092,"That and you're well on your way to limb independence, which'll set you up for drums."
41093,On the contrary: start with drums.
41094,"Good point.  However, he said ""instrument"" not ""conglomeration of instruments."""
41095,"I disagree. The key system is not intuitive. It's ass backwards IMHO. 

I can play keys (I had a career doing sound design and music for games), but I wouldn't recomend it as a first to others.

If you are looking to play keyboards, I've seen complete beginners perform miracles on a hexagonal keyboard, but clearly that won't help here.

http://steelberryclones.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/64_kb0507_audition.jpg"
41096,"I concur - another nice thing about piano is that it provides an excellent structure for learning music theory, which will advance your compositional skills. Additionally, the flexibility in sound generation you gain when you use keyboards will give you an enormous range. 

I'd suggest guitar as your second instrument - this will give you a very different angle on theory and widen the range of your compositions."
41098,I knew i was doing it out of order! dang!
41099,"Trumpet. Seriously. I know like 4 million guitar players, 35,000 drummers, 8,000 piano players and like 2 fucking trumpet players. I'll call you white Miles."
41100,"Speaking as someone who grew up playing trumpet, it doesn't get you laid. Ever.

It does, however, get you perpetually *not laid*."
41101,"trumpet player here.

you're doing it wrong. learn some jazz."
41102,"I spent 5 years playing jazz on it, thanks. Maybe not being cool and good looking was a hindrance as well, I looked like Maynard Ferguson and Chuck Mangione (yes yes I know) had a love child."
41103,I think the problem with trumpet is that it's really hard and you have have to be really good to get laid. With guitar you can get laid just by holding one.
41104,"You weren't in marching band, needs more trombone."
41106,"I think piano would probably be the easiest to start with, although it is a tough cookie to master. The piano provides a visual reference to note positions that make it a lot easier to get to grips with. i.e.... Learning how chords are built from 3+ notes.... differences between major and minor.... chord progressions... It's all easier when you have the visual reference of the black and white keys. 
You can learn guitar chords from a book, and memorize them, but I don't think it really helps with learning how music ""works"" or fits together.  And the weighted keys help add expression to the notes you play, that is quite hard to achieve with a keyboard.
Hope that helps"
41108,"How so? A C on the 6th string does not look related to a C on the 5th string, 5th to 4th etc... 
For instance... I could not pick out all the C notes on every string, without sitting and counting them, but on the piano... C... it's the one that comes before 2 black ones. And moving on from that... a 3rd and 5th... easy to count up to on the keys, but having to count on the fret board is a little trickier.
There is no doubt that if you can master the fretboard though, that the musical side of the piano will come a lot easier."
41109,"It's really not that hard to learn how to find all of the 'Cs' on a fretboard.  The shapes were more intuitive to me than keys.  Once I learned the major and minor barre chords as well as some open chords I felt like I could play along to anything...

Then again, I am drummer that plays some bass, guitar and keys so what do I know?  lol.  Let the drummer bashing begin!"
41110,"Bass. I started on bass and have never regretted it. Get good at it, and you'll always be able to find bandmates.

You'll learn to lock onto a groove, and the power of the [ostinato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato) -- a little-used term which will serve you well on other instruments. (The ultimate ostinato is arguably the bass line to *Taxman* by the Beatles.)

Edit: I see that the Wikipedia article I linked chooses *Day Tripper* as an example, but not *Taxman*. Pooh."
41112,"To the point where Firefox tags it as a spelling error, yes."
41113,"Probably only because it's Italian, not English. Even in use in music notation, you're speaking Italian... it's not really been co-opted into English."
41114,"Be nice, he's a bassist. They don't use *many* terms.

(I keed, I keed, but you know that bassist jokes are the humor mainstay of musicians everywhere)"
41115,Ukulele all the way!!!!!
41116,"I would seriously recommend this. It's easier to pick up (initially) than any of the others, and just far more fun. You can take it with you anywhere, everyone gets a huge kick out of it, and you'd be riding the high tide of the mid-to-late-00s ukulele resurgence. And best of all, of course, is that if you take it seriously, you can produce some absolutely amazing music. With the added bonus of people going ""wtfukulele?"" all the time."
41117,I took it up last year and I love it. I play every day and take it down the beach to hang out and sing some great songs!!!! I prefer quick resulting instruments and it's easier to pick up than the guitar (obviously 4 strings). Go uke go.
41119,[Looks fantastic](http://www.grazianoukuleles.com/double_neck2.html) I must get one.
41121,"Same goes for the beach, camping and any other outdoor activity..."
41122,Keyboard with batteries?
41123,The one you're interested in playing.
41124,Yes. Because that's the only way you'll practice enough to get good.
41125,Skin flute.
41126,Start with it all and see what sticks.
41127,"The suggestions for keyboards or guitar are good in that they both facilitate the learning of theory because of the way they are laid out.

Guitar is very rewarding because playing three simple, easy chords in rhythm and singing along can sound great, and you can learn this much in a day or two, though it may take some weeks to develop the requisite hand (forearm) strength and finger calluses to be able to play for long. From these simple beginnings, with which you can sound good soon, there is an infinite path to improvement in so many different directions.
Add a second guitar or bass player singing harmony, and two people can make quite an impressive sound.

The other way to go is to reach out and grab the instrument that calls to you. Maybe you've always been captivated by the sound of the cello, or the bassoon, or the accordion (another good one for theory), or pedal steel guitar (madness lies this way), or trombone, or vibraphone, or whatever. If you are in love with the sound of the instrument, you will practice and this is the only thing you must do.

It is most important to practice EVERY DAY. It is far better to practice 10 minutes every day than to practice an hour every 3 days. Because if you force yourself to practice that 10 minutes every day at least, you will find that you will end up playing far more than that.

It addition, whatever instrument you choose, you will benefit from also learning to play drums, especially trap set. Playing drums is more like dancing than it is like playing toned instruments. Having good rhythm is more important than playing exactly the right notes. People listening to you will always hear when your rhythm is messed up, but seldom notice an errant note. Learning drums helps your rhythm on all other instruments.

Africans say: If you can walk, you can dance. If you can talk, you can sing.

Good luck. Playing music is one of the most fun things I do."
41128,"You should learn to play the Theremin. It will be tough going, but in the end you'll have an excellent ear for pitch."
41129,"Piano. However, if you are inclined towards wind instruments (not that it sounds like it from your post), learn the clarinet. In my experience, people who learn that one first have much less trouble learning, say, the saxophone than the other way round."
41130,"Well that's only because saxophone is the easiest instrument to learn, ever"
41131,I think piano is the best instrument for starters.
41132,kazoo
41133,"Piano. once you're comfortable with that, everything else in music is easier"
41134,"Your voice. I am not a singer, but I found that learning to sing will help immensely with any other instrument you choose to play. From there you can branch out to any instrument that you fancy."
41136,"I don't think piano is a good foundation. Drums, maybe, but otherwise, piano has as many advantages and drawbacks as any other instrument, and playing piano doesn't 'translate' any better than any other instrument either."
41137,"I think one of the guitars is probably easiest to learn (bass or acoustic guitar), but I think learning the piano first will teach you the most about music, theory wise and whatnot."
41138,"Lot's of good advice here. I came here with the impulse to say, ""learn piano first"", but really there's no reason to put all of your eggs in one basket. You have a couple instruments at your disposal. Spend a little time with each learning the basics and focus more on whichever you have the most fun playing."
41139,Drums.
41140,"This is probably the best suggestion yet. Piano is great for learning theory or reading music and guitar is good for learning chords and chord progressions, but being in time and having a good sense of rhythm is the number 1 skill for a musician."
41141,"Agreed. You don't have to become an amazing drummer. Just become proficient, and it will help immensely."
41142,Piano or drums.
41143,"From what I've heard, piano is the best instrument to start with ESPECIALLY if you're planning on picking up anything else. I took 8 years of piano lessons, and when I decided to start playing guitar (and later Ukulele) I had no problems picking it up because I had learned so much theory and everything with my lessons. That's not to say you need the theory - but knowing the basic way of things helps out. If you don't want to start out with that, though, I'd go with guitar. :)"
41144,"I would recommend picking something you can play by yourself.  Bass and drums are cool, but can get a little boring without people to play with.  Piano and guitar are great solo instruments and you can play them for hours at a time.

Also, think about which instrument are you drawn to the most?  If you can't decide, then think about what music or songs you want to play.  Then ask which instrument will best play."
41145,"learn the one you like the most, and you will still probably drop it. you're 21 already. mastering an instrument takes years."
41146,that's no encouragement at all.
41147,"Not meant to be, it's the truth.  Maybe he'll be one of those adults who does learn an instrument proficiently, but they tend to be white elephants."
41148,"That's no reason to discourage him from learning an instrument at all. No one said he had to play at professional level and the idea that you can't learn after 21 is just stupid bullshit.

HEY OP!! I HOPE YOU ENJOY YEARS OF PLAYING WHICHEVER INSTRUMENT YOU CHOOSE AND DON'T LISTEN TO THESE NAYSAYERS!!"
41149,"Depends on what genres of music you like best.  Keyboards and pianos are out of the question if you're into rock, for the most part.  Bass is easier to learn than guitar due to the lack of chords you'll be playing, but guitars are smaller and might feel more comfortable.

I started with a keyboard, graduated to the guitar and then drums.  Bass came naturally after I learned guitar.

Learn by ear.  Fuck learning by reading sheet music, it's useless as fuck.  Write your own songs, don't play covers. 100% of cover bands are fucking horrid and so unoriginal that they make me want to vomit. You can't fuck up songs that *you* wrote."

41156,"The vast majority of rock bands do not use keyboards.  Simply a statement of fact.  Drums, guitar and bass are clearly the primary instruments in a rock band.  Also, notice that I said *""for the most part""* which clearly indicates that there are some rock bands that use keys. 

**Pay attention.**"
41157,Go play some more pop bro.
41158,"Becoming proficient at any instrument without having ever practiced in your youth is probably not going to work out so great.  Not to be mean, but chances are you won't get past a basic level unless you can make up for all that lost practice time.  A computer is as much an instrument as the guitar someone has played since middle school, get Live, learn to program the key roll, and read how to program a synth.

41208,"> and how should I go about learning it?

I believe you are already starting off wrong just by asking this.  To go about learning, you start to learn.

Just start.

Pick up a used acoustic guitar, head over to songsterr.com, and slowly and painfully learn to play a song that you enjoy."

Buy ""Beginning Autoharp Instruction Book"" by Bonnie Phipps on amazon and it will get you playing right away. I know this because I did all of this myself. Perfect for celtic and folk as well. There is also a late 60s band that uses autoharp and it sounds really cool :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JJJL4Dm-o"
41213,"If you like Celtic music and are familiar with flute, a tin whistle could be a good choice. You can buy one for £5, so can give it a go with minimal investment and give one to a kid without worrying it will destroy it. There's a fantastic book by Grey Larsen, Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle, that covers everything from basics like how to hold it, right up to some really advanced songs. If you then want to take it further, an Irish flute is basically a large tin whistle with a proper flute embouchure hole, all the fingering is the same, so what you've already learnt transfers over"
41214,"If you want something THAT portable, I'd say get a few harmonicas. But the guitar is what you should REALLY be practicing. Get a guitar stand and keep it within reach of wherever you sit around the most (couch, computer desk, bed, whatever.)"
41215,"I'm a big fan of metal, but I think the violin is the most beautiful sounding"
41216,"I wish I could upvote you twice.  Played well, nothing is as beautiful as a violin."
41217,Why don't you upvote him 3 times?
41218,"Cello, but it really depends on who's playing the instrument."
41219,Apocalyptica <3
41220,"Cello + Yo-Yo Ma, hands down."
41221,"Eh that always seem to be the go-to answer, I prefer Mischa Maisky."
41222,"AGREED Maisky is amazing. I saw him perform Shostakovich Cello Concerto with the LA Phil and he had this flare I hadn't witnessed before in other solo cellists. Yo-Yo Ma is amazing technically and I think he does great performances (saw him play Dvorak concerto, wowzers), but he also lacks personality sometimes in his playing. Maisky has personality that just resonates well with his understanding of the music and technicality. 

Johannes Moser is pretty great too (and really nice to look at)"
41223,I love the Bach Cello suites that Mischa Maisky did.
41224,"But those are just two cellists out of many! So many great cellists to choose from. Ma, Maisky, Rostropovich, Casals, Du Pre, Popper, Breval, Cassado, Goltermann, Starker….etc. Such wonderful musicians."
41226,"Cello + [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0W6Vf2icm0), get down"
41227,I agree but lean more towards stand-up bass (double bass).  Whether played with a bow or plucked it's so damned beautiful.
41228,"Absolutely agreed. The first time I cried at a live piece of classical music was Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto No. 1 in A minor Op. 33. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ijSrsu8aMs) is a great performance of it, for the curious. 

Anyway, I don't know what it was about that piece, but I think it also had quite a lot to do with the cellist. A friend of mine played viola in the symphony, and I got to sit in on one of their rehearsals. The passion that came out of that instrument just blindsided me."
41229,Mischa Maisky. Bach Cello suites. My favourite.
41230,"Along those lines, the upright bass. I dig me some sweet bass tones."
41231,"like, Chello! totes the best sounding!"
41257,Piano.
41233,"Came here for this, the piano is an incredible sounding instrument popular in all genres from rock and pop to classical.

Tom waits converted me to my belief, love that man."
41234,Clair de Lune - Claude Debussy
41235,Piano is king of the instruments.
41236,There's just something so otherworldly about a muted trumpet
41237,The 3rd movement of Mahler's 3rd symphony has an off stage flugelhorn (similar to trumpet) that plays at a few points and it is magical.
41238,Harmon mutes = <3
41239,"Before, was guitar. Now Party make theremin teach in school. Theremin concerts mandatory. Music stores only sell theremin.

Now, best sound is theremin sound.

Such is life."
41240,French Horn.
41241,"As a french horn player, stick to only the professionals. I don't think there exists a middle ground for the french horn. Either awful, or amazing."
41242,There's just something about that instrument when an orchestra is playing and then they have a solo part.
41243,"I can agree with that, I just know that I struggle to get even simple notes out sometimes. It really makes you appreciate the people who do it for a living."
41244,I think it is second only to the oboe in that area.
41247,"Pan Flute. I love that airy, ancient sound."
41248,"Clarinet... as long as Squidward isn't playing it.

It's in a bunch of stuff that I couldn't even begin to pick out."
41249,Love it in the beginning of the [Rhapsody in Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynEOo28lsbc)!
41250,That big long smear on the glissando is what I live for as a clarinet player.
41251,Accordion.
41252,The accordion.
41253,"Piano, so many songs to pick from"
41254,Harp
41255,The pipe organ. With the right person playing it any type of music I'd possible. The organist at my church once played pink Floyd.
41256,Cello or Piano
41258,The viola. Like a violin but without all the irritating super high pitched notes.
41259,Electric guitar.
41260,Totally agree. Les Paul clean tones are my favorite. So rich and full. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9nuJEEKyoo
41261,"I love the sounds of a telecasters neck pickup. Just the right amount of fat-ness but still has a sharp, bell-like clarity."
41262,Les Paul through a Marshall stack.
41263,"tenor saxophone, i am sad to admit this for i play the trumpet. Lol"
41264,I agree with you and also play the trumpet... I hate it when sax player play with there thousands of keys and we have 3
41265,"At least you aren't at the mercy of a fragile piece of cane.  Those things can get fiddly, and can change behavior during a concert when the weather changes.  Sometimes they split or get chipped at the end if you're not careful (I play trombone and bassoon, so I can sympathize with everybody)"
41266,"Hardcore woodwind enthusiast here:

Check out Legere synthetic reeds. 

Yes yes, I know the stigma behind synthetics, but these are made differently and are quality reeds.

I've made 1st chair allstate/all-region/university for years on those things, much to my teachers' disapproval. 

The resin isn't susceptible to humidity and temperature, they're much more durable (they don't permanently wear out!), and it really opens up your upper register. 

I use them on all my saxes (though I still like cane for bari, except when I'm playing jazz) and clarinets (minus the contras).

Still can't beat cane for double reeds though."
41267,But the chops man!
41268,"Every instrument has their own unique insane difficulty.  For clarinets it's the Break.  For saxes, it's controlling the sound. For oboe players it's the read. For trombone players it's pitch.  For euphonium players it's finding a job once you get out of college..."
41269,You should try out the [Tromboon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4x7xZO4YUE) then
41270,"Nice!  I've always been afraid to try that, because I'm clumsy and don't have a backup bass trombone in case I drop it."
41271,Didgeridoo.
