39999,Woo Vivaldi user!!
40000,I use OneTab it's the best imo
40003,Great Infographic ! Anyone wouldn't have something similar for Firefox ?
40004,"Many of these are cross-browser, but beware, some of them like Grammarly require a paid subscription to work."
40005,"Good to know, thanks !"
40006,"Grammarly is in fact free, some more advanced features are paid."
40007,"If you are a graduate student or researcher, I highly recommend the Mendeley and Google Scholar extensions.

Neither are included in this diagram."

40010,*cries in 4*
40011,Weird flex but ok
40012,Is uBlock better than AdBlock??
40013,"you should use uBlock Origin
edit: found a good article concerning your question:   https://www.dailywoke.com/ublock-origin-vs-adblock-plus-which-is-the-best-adblocker/"
40014,"Whoa, good to know! Thanks! I've been using regular AdBlock this whole time."
40015,A lot of people do but now you know better!
40016,Ublock origin is considered the one to have right now because it blocks more. Ad block has a whitelist that let's some sites pay to bypass. And there's some other issue with ublock so everyone says get origin because it's from the original ublock dev just without extra bullshit that was added later.
40017,Get the real thing r/pihole
40019,No point in using both. Just stick to uBlock Origin.
40020,"I bet you have 3 antivirus, to be extra safe."
40021,Those (g)mail add-ons can be replaced by the rule: open your mail once or twice a day at set times.
40022,"Or some of those features are already in inbox. If you use Gmail, inbox is just a wrapper on top, provided by Google."
40023,"Inbox was/is discontinued, though, yeah?"
40024,"I still use it everyday....
https://inbox.google.com"
40025,"I did some Googlin’ and yeah it looks like they’ll be discontinuing it sometime next year:

https://www.google.com/inbox/

Which is a shame cause I did really like the layout."
40026,"Well fuck! With all the organization I've put into it, it's way better than gmail for me now..... Guess I'll need to find another solution."
40027,"I think one of the reasons they discontinue it is because many features of inbox are now present in gmail, so it might be less bad than expected?"
40028,A lot of inbox features have been added to gmail anyway. Snooze for example.
40029,Firefox is the best extension for Chrome.
40030,r/madlads
40031,"Nice looking info-graphic with some solid suggestions, I wish [Print Friendly](https://www.printfriendly.com/extensions/chrome) for Chrome had made the list but oh well  
Edit: Print friendly is an extension that removes clutter you normally wouldn't print on a page, and saves money on ink etc. Makes printouts of webpages more presentable."
40033,Yeah I work in IT helping mostly elderly clients and it can be a lot easier for them to reinforce concepts if you send them home with easy instructionals
40034,"I stopped at Grammarly because it requires a **$29.95/month** paid subscription to work, and there's no indication given about that in this infographic, or when you install it.  

How many others require money, and which ones are completely free?"
40035,"The free version gives the following:

* Fix critical grammar and spelling errors
* Punctuation and contextual spelling checker
* Works across the web 

Whereas the paid version offers the following:

* 400+ checks and features, including:
* Punctuation and contextual spelling checker
* Style and document-specific checks (business, academic, etc.)
* Sentence structure checker
* Vocabulary enhancement
* Plagiarism detection

Free would be more than enough for most people I would imagine."
40036,"> Works across the web

What a great feature for a browser plug-in. How about this one?  

* [Grammarly leaks everything you've ever typed in your browser. Everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7w67dv/grammarly_leaks_everything_youve_ever_typed_in/)  

Meanwhile the free service constantly tells you that it has found “advanced issues,” and you need to pay for an upgrade to find out what they are. You'll have to surrender **$29.95/month** to get the corrections that they're holding hostage and using to provoke you. The only thing the free version accomplishes is to make you feel insecure — and to make everything you type literally insecure."
40037,Got a free and secure alternative?
40038,[Update](https://gizmodo.com/grammarly-bug-let-snoops-read-everything-you-wrote-onli-1822740378)
40039,">[Grammarly leaks everything you've ever typed in your browser

This is false and that security flaw was fixed."
40040,"To be fair, if you pay per year, it's $11.66 per month.

Not that that justifies them having a huge security hole in their product..."
40041,"To be fair, if you pay per year, it's **$139.92** per year.  

People looking at a list of recommended browser plug-ins are expecting free unless otherwise indicated, because most plugs *are* free. This gives the impression that either the author didn't actually install and try out these plug-ins, or they're paid shills astroturfing in advertisements."
40042,"I don't mind paying for software-the programmer earns it. But $130+/year is way too much for an extension. For an extension, $12/year should be enough."
40043,Everything you type gets uploaded to their servers. No thanks.
40045,"I tried it and hated seeing the constant notifications that it found ""advanced issues"" which I have to pay to see. I'd rather just adopt an attitude of continual improvement in my own grammar skills. Glad you like it though."
40046,I heard that chrome takes up a lot of space or something? Or that it makes your computer run slower
40047,"It does use relatively much RAM, which means the rest of your system can't use this RAM, therefore the rest of your system will be somewhat slower.

If you spend lots of time within Chrome, without using other applications next to it, that can be worth it, but obviously Google wants its own browser to feel quicker than other browsers, so they don't take your other computer usage as much into consideration as they should.

And before people tell me that ""Unused RAM is wasted RAM"", please, for the love of technology, read up on disk caching. There is practically no unused RAM on any modern operating system."
40049,"It used to seem to drain my laptop battery pretty quickly. Usually I’ll use Hulu to watch a 30 minute show as I fall asleep, without auto play on. By the end I’m asleep and the laptop goes into sleep mode.  Using chrome my laptop is dead by morning. Using Firefox it still has the majority of power in the morning. Not sure if chrome wasn’t letting it go to sleep properly or just used that many resources. Regardless, I quit using it."
40050,Anyone got this infographic in text form? Having it as an image that can't be searched and can't be copy/pasted from is kind of useless
40051,Everyone needs momentum. Great extension
40052,Wikiwand should be there
40054,come back google wave!
40056,"No way, it was way ahead of its time (Obligatory: There are dozens of us, dozens!)"
40057,"Based on the extensions in this list, this looks more like a guide useful for people trying to tackle their ADD with being OCD (except for the uBlock Origin tip, that one is really useful for everyone)"
40058,"The driving forces behind high productivity are typically being organized, setting firm routines, and reducing distractions. I don’t disagree with your qualifying of the list, but not sure why it would be a criticism."
40059,Where is Firefox edition?
40060,"According to some other comments, most seem to work in both."
40061,"My father is blind and could really benefit from less clutter with just read.

I installed it and it looks to be working good, but does anyone know if there's a keyboard command that would toggle it on and off?"
40062,https://github.com/ZachSaucier/Just-Read/#q-how-can-i-start-just-read (though the default shortcut keys did not work for me on Windows)
40063,Laughs in Vivaldi
40064,I think the real question though is how secure are these extensions when it comes to privacy and are they harvesting your data?
40065,"If the extensions aren't, Chrome is."
40066,"Todoist has been my #1 daily tool for the past 5 years - I have a shit memory but by using this tool it is extremely rare for me to forget to accomplish a task no matter how small. Given an objective at work? It goes on the list. SO needs to have an oil change this weekend? On the list. Gotta pay that one off bill? Boom, list. 

I love it but I understand that it doesn't work for everyone. It does take a certain level of diligence to populate and maintain."
40067,Think someone touched on this already in comments but keep in mind how much RAM memory space chrome already uses.
40069,"Honestly, who checks their home email this often? Is this for people who own a home business? I can't imagine many businesses use gmail.

&#x200B;

If you work in an office environment, then you sort of need to have your email open at all times as priorities may change and urgent situations may come up. You need to have your finger on the pulse at work.

&#x200B;

At home, who gives a shit? Check you email once a week. I'm sure nothing on it is that urgent."
40070,gSuite is basically Gmail for business... But I still agree... I barely check my email these days and nothing has burned down yet.
40071,Bitwarden is better than LastPass

40078,"Last I checked, grammerly was also spyware"
40079,"Honey is really useful. It automatically searches for discount codes on shopping sites, although it doesn't work on all sites."
40080,"Plugs that arent for productivity, but still useful? I'm throwing honey out as my suggestion bit do you guys have any more?"
40081,Any awesome extensions for Safari?
40082,Privacy Badger??
40083,These are all useless for me
40084,Honestly I would replace UBlock Origin with Nanoadblock and Nanodefender
40085,I think the best tab management tool is [Tabs Outliner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-discarder/jlipbpadkjcklpeiajndiijbeieicbdh). I've tried Session Buddy & Toby but they really aren't that good compared to Tabs Outliner
40086,"Safari 12 completely ruined Ublock Origin, even if you re-enable it. Had to switch to AdGuard."
40087,Does anybody know of a good program that helps a group of people manage one Gmail inbox?
40088,"Never forget Adblock too.  I use it, and I never get ads on YouTube, it’s pretty much like free Spotify or Apple Music."
40089,Save
40090,Is there a something similar and accurate version of this for Firefox add-ons?
40091,Thanks for suggesting Just Read! I'm glad people find it useful.
40092,I also heard that Firefox is also a cool plugin for chrome *flies away*
40093,"Sorry, I didn't see the ""Stop me from being lazy"" extension."
53477,Very nice
40095,Where's the iDubbbz extension for all thing pretty good on the net
40098,check out [urboard.co](https://urboard.co/)
40100,Nano Defender: https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/jc447f/nano_adblocker_nano_defender_was_sold_and_should/
40101,Bitwarden - best and free passwords keeper!
40102,EcoCart is an example of a sustainability related extension released very recently which helps customers achieve carbon neutrality when online shopping. Check it out! [https://ecocart.io/](https://ecocart.io/)
40103,Agreed! EcoCart is awesome
40104,"\- [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen) to check my typed English words; 

\- [Adblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) to block ads on certain web sources; 

\- [SignalHire](https://www.signalhire.com/extension) to get contact info of potential clients/biz partners, etc."
40105,"A personal favourite of mine has been [Find website used fonts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-website-used-fonts/lnebjgioddkafaldaaeooeghlcholnnp).  Pretty simple and easy to use as it automatically lists all the fonts used on a web page and also lets you type in some text to see a preview of your text in that particular font style. Handy for web designers and developers!

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-website-used-fonts/lnebjgioddkafaldaaeooeghlcholnnp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-website-used-fonts/lnebjgioddkafaldaaeooeghlcholnnp)"
40106,"As everyone else is suggesting, [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) is an absolute must. If you don't have any other extensions, you MUST have this one. (I showed this to an old man at work one time and he called me a freeloader, so be careful)

&#x200B;

[BitWarden](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb?hl=en) is another essential one. It is a password vault and it is open source. It does not require you to buy anything, it gives you access to all features for free, and it is encrypted with military-grade encryption. My preferred password-keeping app. You can easily import data from any other password-keeping app. 

&#x200B;

[Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US) keeps websites from tracking you and it provides another layer of security for those people who do not like being tracked.

For reducing Chrome's memory footprint - [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) and [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en)"
40107,Onetab removed everything I had saved in it for two years. I used to use it as a faster and easier bookmarking tool. Uninstalled after that. I do miss the functionality though.
40108,"Oh man, this scares me. That's why I take backups once every month or so just because I'm paranoid and afraid of things like this. Thank you for the heads up >.<"
40109,"Chrome's memory usage never really bothered me; my opinion is, unused memory is wasted memory. I already use ublock origin and bitwarden, I'll have to check out privacy badger. I always just assumed ublock blocked most of the tracking crap already."
40110,"Sponsorblock : skips sponsored segments in youtube video's

Ublock origin : blocks the normal youtube ad's

Darkreader : can make every page darkmode friendly"
40111,"you should try out "" ublock origin "" as an adblocker,shifted to it several weeks back and so far it seems better than adblock or adblock plus (low impacton the system as well). And it's element zapper is so easy to use."
40112,"Interesting to note- chrome extensions also work on the new chromium-based edge!

As a dev I like wappalyzer for checking what tech websites are using."
40113,"Not an extension, but I was impressed by BuiltWith - [https://builtwith.com/](https://builtwith.com/)"

40130,"I only have 3 extensions installed. 

**Bitwarden** - Password manager, works great.

**uBlock Origin** - ""Install it and forget it"" ad blocker, never had any problems, the element picker tool is great too.

**Dark Reader** - Dark mode for web pages, you can control the contrast, brightness and other stuff, rarely messes up pages, but has a noticeable performance impact if your computer is a potato."

40133,Dark Reader
40134,"## [imagus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab?hl=en) named only once?

It allows on any page to just point mouse at an image an it popsup full size fitting the screen.

works with gallers, allows reverse image search by pressing `s`, allows rotate... only issues is that some videos dont have sound, which is annoying."
40135,Ublock beats Adblock by far. I’ve used Ublock for years.
40136,"Some useful extensions that are not mentioned here:

Tap 2 tab


Alitools


Keepa"
40137,[Old Reddit Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje?hl=en-US)
40138,"Also [Reddit check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-check/mllceaiaedaingchlgolnfiibippgkmj), I never see it being mentioned but is probably the best extension related to Reddit after RES. You watching a link from somewhere else? find any post on Reddit where that link was posted. Pretty useful to see discussions on reddit about anything you consume."
40139,"I only use uBlock Origin and Tampermonkey. I actually have a script that blocks all the things that uBlock Origin doesn't. I also have a bunch of other scripts, like one that always moves Continue Watching and My List to the top of Netflix. I used to make them ""sticky"" at the top of the screen, but that actually got annoying."
40140,"The ones I use on a daily basis or useful ones that I occasionally use:

* uBlock origin - ad-blocker
* Dark Reader - universally converts light pages to dark ones
* Violentmonkey - a better version of tampermonkey (which lets you run custom scripts on webpages).
* Imagus - shows full-res images in an inline popup when I hover over an image
* RES (and mod toolbox)
* Windscribe - VPN
* Join, for connecting my phone and sharing my clipboard between my PC and my phone, or quickly sending links/files between them
* Lastpass - password manager
* CrxcrxMouse - lets me draw gestures by holding right-click and moving the mouse, and lets me close/reopen tabs, etc. without much movement
* Keepa - amazon price history and tracking, embedded right on the page of each item I view
* Honey - searches for coupon codes and automatically enters them in the promo/coupon code box when I'm buying something online and am at the checkout page
* Project Naptha - lets me select text that is embedded in images
* Turn off the Lights - on youtube, it dims everything outside of the video, and adds a little ambilight-style glow around the video that changes dynamically with the vid"
40141,"Everyone is mentioning some pretty basic ones, so I would like to mention 5 specialized ones that became really important to my workflow in the last couple of years...

* [History Trends Unlimited](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme) syncs your history to a local database to work around the (approximate) 3-month time limit imposed by Chrome. Basically an improved search for your chrome history.

* [Selection Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selection-search/gipnlpdeieaidmmeaichnddnmjmcakoe) Most useful ext to me, it's basically a menu of customized searches. Let's say your workflow includes a constant search from google and other sites, with this extension you can save those parameters and recall them to search by just selecting text over the web. If you have 5 searches in one menu you can open them all at once with just a shortcut. A good example of this is searching on different stock images sites, if you are looking for pictures of dogs, you can just hover the text ""dog"" and search for results of dog pictures in a customized search for like 10 sites at the same time, with just one shortcut.

* [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) Simple, basic, useful. Click OneTab to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.

* [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) Change the appearance of websites instantly. This allows you to change the CSS on different websites locally. If you visit a website, a forum, or a blog a lot but you find the background annoying for your eyes, the size of the letters too small, or something similar, you can change it with this. It has a UI and also the possibility to manually add CSS code

* [Extensions Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-manager-aka-sw/lpleipinonnoibneeejgjnoeekmbopbc) Pretty selfexplanatory. A extensions, applications, and themes manager. Disable and undo your changes with a click."

40154,"They are the same chip, the 2600X just has a higher base and boost clock.  

At stock speeds there is about a 6% difference, and overclocked they are both identical, so I would never recommend spending $60 more for the X version."

40156,Would I need to overclock to throw everything at it and it to run just fine? Also what motherboard do I have to pick if I'm going with ryzen?
40157,"No, overclocking isn't required and you'll be able to run everything just fine without it.  However taking a couple hours to watch some guides and learn how to overclock will let you get a bonus ~10-15% extra performance.

For motherboard you'll need B450 or X470 chipsets.  B450 is cheaper and usually has all of the features you'll need so that would be my choice.  Brand doesn't matter too much, there are quality boards from all manufacturers, just check reviews for whatever you decide to buy."

40159,Ryzen 5 2600
40160,Isn't Intel better at gaming?
40161,They were. Now they’re pretty much equal but ryzen CPU’s can be upgraded for a new one but for intel you will need to buy a new motherboard when you upgrade. That’s why I would recommend ryzen
40162,You just said that the i7-8700 is expensive for you. So I recommended a cheaper option.
40163,Isn’t that people said about the 8-gen cpus?
40164,Ryzen chips are heavily reliant on ram isn't it ? I heard that lesser ram would get you lesser performance for the ryzen 2600 or 2600x
40165,Yes but that is with every cpu. Although around 8 or 16 gigs will be enough.
40166,But the speeds of the 16 GBs would differ from one another
40167,I would take either 3000 or 2800 MHz
40168,"[https://youtu.be/KRLjKr939RM](https://youtu.be/KRLjKr939RM)  


time: 19:15"
40169,"Ryzen does like high frequency memory, but 3000-3200MHz RAM is not that expensive.  In fact on PCpartpicker right now, the cheapest 2133 kit and cheapest 3000 kit are the same price."
40170,"Yes, but not by much and title specific. An intel cpu may be 5-10% faster but cost 150-200+ dollars more. You can put that towards a better GPU.

It all depends on your budget. If money is no concern, just go intel. If it is, you cant best a 2600+ a higher tier of vid card for same price."
40171,"Intel is better at the extreme high end.

If you plan on gaming on a 60hz screen, you will not notice any difference in peak FPS, the benefit will only show up once you invest in 144hz screens or play stuff like CSGO and need 200+ FPS, and even then i wouldnt consider the price difference between a 2600 and a 8700 or similar worth it."
40172,"If you overclock yourself: Ryzen 5 2600

If you would rather have the system deal with it: Ryzen 5 2600x


> The 2600x also looks like a good deal but would it play many games with a 1070ti?

yes."
40173,So I wouldn't have to overclock with the 2600x?
40174,It adjusts the clock speed automatically so no you wouldn't have to do any overclocking. AMD explains it in this ~[5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=426hLGoXDbM)
40175,"Also, I heard that ryzen is heavily reliant on ram so if my ram is not good my pc wouldn't run well?"
40176,"Ryzen likes 3000+mhz ram. And since 2400mhz ram is barely any cheaper than 3200mhz ram you can gain quite a bit of performance for really low amount of extra cost.

TL;DR going from 2400mhz to 3200mhz is a really good price/performance investment. (your ryzen would still work with 2400mhz ram)."
40177,"What resolution are you playing at?

40180,Intel i7
40181,"if you're just gonna list all the current and previous gen ryzen 5s and 7s and core i5s and i7s what's the point of making a ""best of"" list"
40182,I agree. But there is much more information in the link provided.
40183,It’s still shit
40184,lots of good cpus but what happened to the 11400/11400f? Really great overall bang for buck imo
40185,They listed every CPU except the best CPU for gaming.
40186,"Honestly, I think the 10600K/F is a better bet right now than the 11400/F. It's only like $20 more right now, beats it by a bit stock, and beats it by a larger margin when overclocked. Even if you don't want to spend the extra money on a K board, you can always just unlock the power limits on a B560 board and get most(ish) of the benefits still."
40187,"People argued that the 11400 was ignored due to 'availability', but that's wrong for two reasons. First its available at MSRP from B&H, BestBuy, and Walmart and below MSRP at Microcenter.

https://pcpartpicker.com/product/92VmP6/intel-core-i5-11400-26-ghz-6-core-processor-bx8070811400

Second, you cant really argue that you shouldnt recommend products based on availability, when reviewers, including Anandtech recommended Zen 3 which was sold out online for months, and certain skus like the 5950x still arent available yet get recommended (not for gaming). Also GPU recommendations make the point moot too, because heres the link for GPU's that are sold by Newegg directly and are in-stock https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?Submit=Property&Subcategory=48&N=100007709%204131%208000&IsPowerSearch=1 Currently you can only buy a $3,000 NVIDIA Tesla M10"
40188,"For real, $440 will get you a 11400, a solid B560 board, and 16GB of 3600C16 memory, or even $410 if you live near a microcenter. 3-4 years down the line if (when) 6-core CPUs start showing their age, you can sell the combination for $250ish or pass it down to friends/family and get another midrange build on the newest platform that outperforms the current high-end chips. 

There's of course edge cases like 360 Hz esports players but for the vast majority of gamers with a 3070/6700XT-class GPU or worse the difference between a 11400 and 5800X/11700k/10900k in current titles is going to be pretty much nonexistent. The performance gap has narrowed massively between the low-end and higher-end parts recently. Not nearly as many caveats now as with previous budget heros like the 1600AF, i3-9100, etc."
40189,Where's the game benchmarks? They just named every CPU and their price.
40190,"The performance of the CPUs in Anandtech's ""best X for Y"" lists is based off their own benchmarks and reviews, which go pretty in-depth and can be found elsewhere on the site. They don't bother summarizing them for the monthly lists, and instead focus on the things that actually change from month to month: price and availability."
40191,"I do like when sites do updated lists for things like this. However, it seems like they are just saying for this budget, these are the options then listing any latest gen part in that price. Its more of best value for gaming at these price ranges, as let's be real, the 11900k and 5950x aren't listed cause they are priced higher than the rest here. But are infact the best cpus for gaming if you ignore price from each maker."
40192,"INFO: The best CPUs for gaming ($400+) are AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and Intel Core i7-11700K.

For around $350, the best are Intel Core i9-10900F, Intel Core i7-11700 and AMD Ryzen 5 5600X.

For around $300, the best are AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, Intel Core i7-10700KF and Intel Core i5-11600K.

For around $200, the best are AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and Intel Core i5-10600KF. For $61, there is Intel Celeron G5905."
40193,So whichever CPU exists at your price point is the best?
40194,Lol yup that's modern day journalism for you
40195,"Correct answer: 

The i5 10400f/Ryzen 3600 are the current minimum. Just fine for mid range. 

5600x/10600k/11400f/11600k are current beasts. Will be outdated soon due to core count.

I7 10700k/3700x: Previous Gen 8 cores, long term will age gracefully even if performance is less than the latest 6 core parts. 

10850k/10900k: Best ones to buy if you get them around $300-320. Extra two cores is nice for long haul and performance is right behind the 5800x/11700k. 

5800x/11700k: Fine. 8 cores, good enough for a few years. Best gaming CPUs, but only marginally better than the 10850k/10900k and imo not worth losing the two cores. 

11900k: Is this a joke? 

5900x: 12 cores, if you can afford it definitely a nice value.

5950x: Wtf overkill alert but hey you got the cash buy it.

Not mentioned: i7 10700(f), 10900(f), 11700(f)/11900(f). Why the hell would you buy a cpu that expensive without overclocking? No just no."
40196,"I agree with most of your post. However, I think it's a bit misleading to say current gen 6 core cpus will be outdated soon whereas previous gen 8 cores will age gracefully.

It's not like 8 cores is a magic number which promises future proofing. I think to get an idea of how well a cpu ages it's a good idea to look at benchmarks which scale well in multithreaded scenarios, because I think the underlying assumption is that in the future applications/games will utilise higher core counts better.

The reason I say it's misleading is that a high performing 6 core like the r5 5600x is only around 10% behind the 3700x and 10700k in benchmarks that scale very well with cores like cinebench r20. So the multicore performance is much closer than if you just looked at the 33% higher core count of the 8 core models. https://www.techspot.com/review/2135-amd-ryzen-5600x/

Similarly the 5800x performs surprisingly closely to the 10900k in multithreaded benchmarks despite the 10900k having 25% more cores. (10850k and 10900k are awesome though with the good pricing they've had at times)"
40197,"> cOrReCt AnSwErs:

> 3700x and 10700k will age gracefully 

xD

If they are getting beaten atm by cheaper CPUs atm, they'd continue getting beaten by cheaper CPUs for at least a couple of years. 6c/12t wouldn't magically become outdated ""soon"" and it's not like 8c/16t would be protected or much better. But that isn't going to happen for at least 2-3 years so it's an entirely pointless point you are making. 

 And the money you are saving atm in buying a cheaper cpu and cheaper mobo can be used to buy better ones when you upgrade in a few years. It's not like 10900k would demolish the CPUs in 3 years time. Even the mid range alternatives would probably at worst be equal. Meanwhile you are telling people to spend more money NOW and get worse performance NOW, only to then once again have to upgrade at the exact same time.


At the moment 4c/4t are slowly becoming outdated though they still run most games over 100 fps, meanwhile you think that 6c/12t would magically become garbage in the 2-4 years before you upgrade? 2500k can still pump out 100+ fps in most games. A 10 year old processor... Even though 3700x would age a bit better, even if you keep your processor for 5 years it'd likely still be equal/worse than the 5600x in gaming. Devs can't just raise the requirements as high as humanly possible when 80% of the community is still rocking a 4c/4t and a 1060 3gb. These things are very slow and gradual. You should be extremely safe buying a 6c/12t as they'd likely become the new low standard that 4c/4t has been for many years now. 

Unless you need only the cores/productivity it makes 0 sense to buy these processors. 5600x is actually a bit cheaper in my country than 3700x and it's faster in gaming and only slightly slower in productivity. You can buy 5600x, enjoy a much better gaming experience and then upgrade in 2-3 years with the newest mid range component and it'd be way faster than your 3700x because not only would the 7000 CPU be much faster, you'd also be moving to ddr5.

11400f is quite easily one of the best processors you can buy atm because it's much cheaper than the processors it's rivaling and it doesn't make much sense to go all out and buy a 5900x when ddr5 and ryzen 7000 are on the way. Buying a 3700x over it is asinine unless you really need the extra bit of multi core performance and you need it right now. It's a pricier CPU that also performs worse and would most likely continue performing worse even at the time of your upgrade. It's much smarter to buy the faster and cheaper CPU and save the extra money to upgrade to ryzen 7000/8000/9000 and ddr5 in a few years.

P.S. Unless you have lots of money to spare and want the best of the best even if it's only 5% improvement for double the price, it makes no sense to buy the flagship or in this case even the one below the flag ship. 5800x vs 5600x is a no brainer if you are talking about gaming, which is exactly what you are promoting them as. ""Good enough for a few years. Best gaming CPUs"". There's absolutely no reason to buy a 5800x if your goal is gaming. None. You are spending 150 dollars more for an almost nonexistent gain(it's like 1% on average). I could sell my CPU, mobo and ram and use that extra 150 and upgrade in a year or two and it'd still be cheaper and that CPU would be faster than the 5800x in every single way."
40198,"I would take the opposite side of your k skus complaint, particularly since B560 boards now offer XMP. Overclocking is no longer worth the money."
40199,"Uhm in my country the 10700f is cheaper than the 5600x, so I'd rather go for that one"

8 cores vs 6 don't (yet) make a difference for gaming. For everything productivity, the more cores the better so an 8-core wouldn't make a ""best workstation"" category either. 

Which just kind of goes to show that these types of lists aren't really all that representative"
40209,"But a best ""budget workstation"". The 3950x is 700€ here and it does spare you maybe 3-4 minutes per one hour render, that's not that much, whilst the 3700x is 280€ (here) right now. That is less than half of the 3950, but just 90€ more than the 3600x.

So if at all then the 8core is the budget king for designers who require render tasks. A 700  bucks processor is still quite expensive for most freelancer."

40219,"PS4 and Xbox both have 8 cores, but afaik 1 core is reserved for the OS, in the next gen i can see them having a few threads dedicated to data streaming from the drive, and a core dedicated to the OS, so overall we're still talking 6-7 cores at best available for games"
40220,Both consoles have dedicated hardware for SSD decompression.
40221,"I dunno, people have been saying that for a really long time.  And still, to this day, if you want super high frames your best bet is to get the cheapest intel chip that will scream to 5ghz.  This 10600K reminds me of the old e8400 in a way, would be more of a true comparison if the cheaper 10400 chip had the high clockspeed capability as this chip is not cheap.  But it's a screamer, really making me think seriously about intel for my summer/fall build (still jamming on my old AMD FX6300)."
40222,"Current gen consoles were 8 core, but they were 8 core 8 thread and the individual cores were weak, even at the time."

40224,"An 8 core cpu is like a handyman. Good at everything, but not the best at anything. There is a more powerful or better value CPU on either side. 

Also AMDs pricing makes the 12 core and 8 core equivalent in value - which is very odd price wise"
40225,"Yeah, but unfortunately that doesn't really extend to the 16-core part."

40227,"8 core still isn't that useful over 6 core in gaming. And if for content creation, if you're just a casual hobbyist 6 core still enough, and if you're more serious the 3900X is the better option."
40228,they should also stop testing with medium settings just to create cpu bottleneck at 200+ fps. And i get it they want to create that bottleneck otherwise they have nothing to show but at some point your just creating artificial bottlenecks for the sake of it with no real world application
40229,"It's getting hard to find these real world application benchmarks. For me when I searched for 3300x vs 1600af comparison with a realistic GPU in this budget, first non 2080 result was 31st video on list"
40230,"The 3300x is just out, and every reviewer always starts with the 2080ti. But gamers nexus does have a small section in their review for GPU scaling and Hardware unboxed is probably going to dedicated a video on it soon.

Other then that finding actual realistic performance numbers is quite difficult since all cpu are paired with a 2080ti and all gpu's with a 9900ks at 5.2 ghz.

Try techepiphany, they recently released something that might be interesting for you"
40231,"If they did that they wouldn't be testing the CPU, they'd be testing the GPU."
40232,"It would still be useful information, because for a prospective buyer, it's interesting to know at what point the CPU is no longer bottlenecking the GPU. If a 3300X is enough to run a certain game when matched with a high end GPU, then there's no need to fork out the money for a 10900K or 3900X and that extra money could be better spent on a GPU upgrade.

There's value both in seeing what the theoretical power of each CPU is in a gaming scenario and in seeing how much of that power you really need before other parts start holding you back."
40233,"Maybe just watch a few GPU benchmarks to see what your GPU can do so you can use your smarts to figure out whether there'll be a big bottleneck?

I don't understand the point of CPU benchmarks @ 1080p or higher cause you'll never know if the GPU is bottlenecking and if it is by how much, when and where so you'll never see the true performance of the processor. CPU benchmarks should be done at 720p or lower with graphic settings maxed out (excluding stuff like antialiasing etc. that only taxes the GPU)

And also if you'd test CPUs at 1080p or higher there wouldn't be a point anyway cause most of the benchmarks would be done with a single GPU and that'd likely be the best one available. Am I interested in seeing CPU benchmarks that only point out which is the most cost-effective CPU to play games @ 1080p with a 2080 TI? Not really.

tl;dr: just watch a fucking GPU benchmark if you want to see a GPU benchmark"
40234,"no, they would just be testing realistic scenarios instead of artificial cpu bottleneck scenarios."
40235,"There are benchmark that are there to test CPU's and get a comparison of raw CPU performances such as cinebench.   


When it comes to games, you are using good hardware then test it at settings that would be expected such as high/ultra. If you are testing low end chips then pair it with a low end GPU and test it in games with that. When I look at CPU comparisons for games I want them to be realistic to what they are going to be used for."

TIL that ~10% in 1080p with a $1200 GPU in 2020 is ""a long way"".

Like having a car that can corner at 1.2G instead of 1.1G because you put on extra sticky track tires that suck for anything else

The only context where it matters is literally racing other people. 

Gaming is just driving. Now driving a fast car is better than driving a slow one, but it isn't racing. Racing other people is competitive benchmarking for its own sake. Only then does it matter *precisely* how fast your machine is relative to others without consideration for any other aspects."

I don't recall ever seeing people claim that Ryzen was ""smoother"" in gaming when it didn't have a core or thread count advantage. I certainly would not expect my 2700X to be ""smoother"" in gaming than a 9900K."

There's no Zen2+ on the roadmap. There's a recently announced refresh of some Zen2 CPUs, but these are just better binned versions of existing models without any other changes. So they don't constitute a new generation (not even an intermediate ""+"" generation).

Zen4 / Ryzen 5000 is expected to be a departure from AM4, but that's still at least 1.5 year away."
40248,"> Zen4 / Ryzen 5000 is expected to be a departure from AM4, but that's still at least 1.5 year away.

40254,You welcome.
40255,The 1600 AF also comes with a Wraith Stealth instead of the Wraith Spire.
40256,"Gotta quibble a bit on the low end workstation recommendation. 3900X is pretty good in my workstation load (Developer), and for the difference in price the 3950X wasn't really worth it for me. Now, I don't use it for video rendering, so I can't really speak to that use-case, but I'm typically running 2-3 VMs, an IDE or two, some supporting tooling, some diagramming software... Handles that just fine and has plenty of cores. 3950X has 4 more cores for 2x what I paid (700 vs 350, plus an additional 20$ savings when I purchase a qualifying MOBO)."
40257,"I agree they recommend the 3950X for a “hobbyist” as a decent machine before threadripper.
I am a hobbyst, compiling stuff on a daily basis on an ageing i7700k without much issue. 
The 3950x is a beast of a CPU that is hard to justify in most cases honestly. 
I could use more cores to let a dev VM run more snappily but goddamn is Steve out of touch on this one."
40258,"For me I give 4 threads to each, so usually I have 12-16 available for the host system, Java's usually pretty quick to compile and the projects I work on aren't on the same order of complexity as firefox or chromium, so using that benchmark (Which he mentioned in his video) is basically irrelevant to what I do and the real world performance I'd see. Way out of touch for developer needs. I need ram more than I need cores. The machine before this one was dual 6 core Xeon and I didn't feel like I was lacking for cores on that one either."
40259,"He forgot the Athlon 200ge, best niche cpu ever."
40260,people seem to forget that the 10600kf exists
40261,Where can you get one?
40262,"wait till it pops up on amazon i guess, but it still exists, and it’s only $230"
40263,"Seems like a decent idea for gaming, but you have to add the cost of a cooler, right? And it's probably sensible to wait for the new AMD lineup before buying right now"
40264,IMO you should wait until the release of Zen 4 before getting anything high-end because DDR5 and the fact that PCI Gen 4 will be more mainstream by then. You could do what I plan to do and build a decent PC that can hold up until then.
40265,"My question is, how the hell did he get 4000mhz memory down to a cas latency of 15 and is there a video of him doing it?"
40266,The $400 3900X should Best all around CPU as well.
40267,"10600K overpriced shit.

3300X to expensive.

3600 Sweetest spot.

3950X Out of league for most people.

3990X For professional use.

10900K Again overpriced shit."
40268,"How is the 3300X too expensive? I hate to be that guy, but if you can't afford that, then you're stuck with Pentiums, Celerons and Athlons."
40269,It's kind of expensive if you consider that its only 4 core CPU. I personally would be afraid of buying it right now for gaming looking into future.
40270,"Well... 3300x is quite expensive. In my country:

**Ryzen 3300x**: 145 USD

**Ryzen 3600**: 204 USD

Clearly, Ryzen 3600 is a better choice - 2 more cores and 4 additional threads for only ~50 USD."
40271,"The cost per core is pretty close, the 3300x should drop a little in price when there is more competition.  Literally every PC store is trying to sell 3600s so you get the best price."
40272,"I have Pentiums, celerons and Athlons in my personal Museum and atm i have 20$ X5675 @4.2GHz which is 25% slower than 3300X in cinebench r20 so yes it's expensive in my terms and comparing it with other ryzens."
40273,Get the 5800x
40274,if you want streaming+gaming i think the 10850K is your best option right now unless you can find the 5800 for cheaper.
40275,"There's not going to be a great deal of difference to be honest. Will you be running NVME? If so, go with 11700k or 5600X, pcie4 NVME is a lot faster than the pcie3 that the 10700k has. Here's a comparison of the 5800x, 10700k and 11700k, gaming performance of the 5600x should be on par as most games are GPU bound. https://www.techspot.com/review/2261-ryzen-5800x-vs-core-11700k-vs-10700k/"
40276,"I'm gonna be using nvme m.2 but PCIe 3.0 since I don't think the PCIe 4.0 is worth the money over 3.0 for me, I can get 5800x over the 5600x and 10700k for 90 usd, so I think I could spend 90 more for it."
40279,"I looked up benchmarks and in gaming they seem to be extremely close, especially when I am gaming on a 1440p ultrawide, and 4k VR headset. Is there any reason at all to spend 50% more on the 5600x for strictly gaming? 

&#x200B;

I'm also surprised AMD hasn't released a 5600 non x or something else to compete with it in that segment, are they getting cocky lol?"
40280,"11400F is an absurdly good CPU for the price. In gaming it just about matches the 5600x, and it's half the cost. Pair with any B560, but preferably B560 Pro4 or B560M Pro-VDH."
40281,Why those MBs specifically?
40282,"Because they have good enough VRMs and a better than basic PWM controller for RAM support, and aren't too expensive."
40283,"Alright and last thing, I'll still be able to use my 212 Evo right? No need for a new cooler?"
40284,212 Evo is totally fine here
40285,"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html"
40286,"I’d say an i7 10700 as they priced for all Intel products have been slashed, the only problem might be a motherboard although my girlfriend found one for $120 although I can’t remember the name"
40287,2600
40299,Thanks so much
40289,"Yes 2060 is powerful enough, and either i3-8350k or i5-8600k from intel, and r5-2600(x) or r7 2700 from AMD.
Personally I’d go with the i5 or the ryzen 5"
40290,Ok. Thanks so much for the fast reply!
40291,"I sort by new, It’s fun to help people!"
40292,Haha. Thanks
40293,Budget for CPU and mobo
40294,I’m not really sure but I’d say the whole build would be 900
40295,"Do you need ssd/hdd, ram, case and psu as well?"
40296,Yes I do
40297,Ryzen 5 2600x on a msi b450 tomahawk or pro gaming carbon depending on which one looks better to you and if you need Wi-Fi.
40298,I5 9600k
40300,"The 9600k is at a good price right now, and if youre willing to overclock in 5 to 6 years it will last even longer in terms of performance."
40301,">5 to 6 years it will last even longer

*doubt*"
40302,"I plan on pairing a RTX-2060 with an i5-8400 or 8500. Maybe even the 9400F (no internal GPU). 

I have seen a lot of people recommend both the i5-8400/8500 or the AMD 2600 or 2600x for gaming builds at 144hz 1080p. 

&#x200B;

I am interested to see what some other people say here."
40303,Ok thanks so much for the quick reply!
40304,"If you're planning on streaming, definitely go with the Nvidia option. Nvidia's NVENC on Turing cards is stellar and just miles ahead of what AMD has for encoding on their cards right now. 

Ray Tracing is basically using the GPU to track how light bounces and actually simulate light, which allows for things like actual accurate reflections, better global illumination, etc. It's not currently widely supported, but it's highly likely it will become more and more supported as time goes on and the hardware to run it gets more powerful."
40305,For the cpu if you want a good cpu for about under $500 usd look at the Ryzen 3900x as for the gpu yes the 5700xt does rival the 2070 super for less rtx cards are nice and powerful but not many games support Ray tracing or DLSS (deep learning super sampling). As of now I think four maybe five games support it. Between the cpu and gpu alone that's under 1k if your total budget is 1k then get a 3600 and 2060 as that will be much cheaper
40306,2060 and 3600 is about 1000 for me... Here's my parts list: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/zWggK4. What am I doing wrong?
40307,"That build list is really good I said the processor and gpu alone as nothing else included is ""just under 1k but if 1k was the TOTAL budget"". Your build list is perfect for a budget of 1k"
40308,"Alright, thank you."
40309,"The 5700xt is probably overkill as you say for just 1080p gaming.

RTX is nvidias dedicated Ray tracing hardware. Currently it's mostly just a marketing gimmick and imho isn't worth the extra cost. If you'd rather buy an nvidia gpu go for a 1660 super.

As you say the 3600 or 3600x is your best value cpu atm. Ryzen 4000 is still months away so up to you if you want to wait. The difference between the 3600 and 3600x is the 3600x has a bigger cooler and slightly higher clock. Most people think it's not worth the extra money but imho if the difference is only 20 bucks it doesn't really matter."
40310,Just built ryzen 5 3600 with radeon 5700 xt. No problems and running 140 fps at 1080. Its awesome.
40311,I did nothing but install the latest updates
40312,"Normally I would recommend the 5700xt. However, I see this is your first build. The AMD drivers for their graphics cards are not great at the moment, and cause some system instability for some people, especially under load. If you’re tech savvy enough to find out how to correct some of the issues and do it yourself, then I think it’s a great deal! But, if you’re not comfortable with that, and you want something that just works, I would go for a 2060 super with a 3600x. I encourage you to do a little research on that topic before you make your final decision. 

In regard to waiting for the 4000 Series CPU it 3000 series GPU, unless you want to wait until mid summer to fall, just buy what is available now. Many components are having their (rumored) release dates pushed back due to Corona

EDIT: Also I see you don’t have peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse). I recommend factoring that I to the cost of your build. I made that mistake and spent more than I wanted to lol"
40313,"12600k, hands down. Nothing comes close at it's price. If you ask why, look at the reviews."
40314,12600k
40315,can you add more as to why it would be better?
40316,same price a lot more raw power
40317,ah ok thanks! do you by chance have any good guides youve read on this just so I can expand my understanding
40318,youtube has tons of benchmarks
40319,would u recommend waiting for DDR5 vs 4? im looking to upgrade a 6700k and DDR5 is expensive
40320,"DDR5 in a 12600K is overkill. Use DDR4, you wont even notice any difference, especially in gaming. I have a 12900k with DDR5 so I speak from experience... That and its near impossible to find DDR5 (and the price)"
40321,"5800x and a nice b550.

Edit: why the downvotes you dipshits? 12th gen intel is buggy, pricey, and runs hot. I am providing sound advice."
40322,mind explaining a bit more about why? Really trying to learn here
40323,It has more cores and threads than 5600x and will last you longer in the future. It’s called being more future proof. It is usually on sale while the 5600x usually isn’t . A good price for 5800x is $370 or under. A b550 is a great midrange motherboard than will ensure you get all the performance you can out of your cpu and gpu.
