56173,I’ve always thought of Predator more like a horror movie.
56174,"to me its like a 3 part film, 1st act Action, 2nd Horror and 3rd survival"
56175,"I’ll agree to that :)

If memory serve, the director said it was deliberately an extreme macho movie in the beginning, so we knew the soldiers where the most badass ever, making the second slasher horror movie that much more intense."

I would choose Silverado."
56185,"Mad max fury road has set the bar pretty high for recent action. Like 90% of that movie was real, it's mind boggling."
56186,what do you mean real?
56187,"Practical effects. They cars, desert, action, stunts, and explosions all happened in real life and were shot on camera. Of course there is some green screen, but the vast majority of that movie was filmed. I think it's easy for people to forget how much work needs to go into making action of that caliber.

56205,"I couldn't tell you what the ""best"" action movies of all time are, but I can tell you my favorites. Here's my top 15 favorite action flicks at the moment (using a loose definition of ""action flick""):

1. the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981, 1984, and 1989) - In the 1930s, archaeologist Indiana Jones battles to prevent religious artifacts from falling into evil hands.
2. the original Star Wars trilogy (1977, 1983, and 1980) - Moisture farmer Luke Skywalker gets caught up in the Galactic Civil War after being recruited by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him aid Princess Leia, a key leader in the Rebel Alliance battling against the evil Galactic Empire.
3. *Rough Riders* (1997) - Theodore Roosevelt resigns from his government post to become the leader of a group of volunteer American dismounted cavalry fighting in the Cuban campaign of the Spanish-American War.
4. *Commando* (1985) - A former special forces operative comes out of retirement after his daughter is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries.
5. *Metropolis* (1927) - It doesn't really become an action-adventure movie until its last third, but this silent sci-fi epic about tensions between the upper and working classes reaching their breaking point in the city of the future is ace.
6. *The Wind and the Lion* (1975) - Very, very, very, very, very loosely based on a real event, a hostage crisis in 1904 Morocco brings the United States to the brink of war with desert rebels
7. *Dillinger* (1973) - Bank robber John Dillinger and his supergang tear through the American Midwest on a crime spree in the 1930s.
8. *The Magnificent Seven* (1960) - A team of seven gunslingers travel to Mexico to protect a defenseless village there from a gang of bandits.
9. *The Guns of Navarone* (1961) - During World War II, a team of Allied commandos is dispatched to the Greek island of Navarone to sabotage two massive Nazi cannons there.
10. *Death Wish 3* (1985) - Architect-turned-vigilante Paul Kersey wages war on the street gangs of New York City (so-bad-it's-good, obviously).
11. some of the other Star Wars films (2016, 2005, 2018, and 2015) - I don't consider them canon in my ""headcanon,"" but these action-adventures set everybody's favorite far, far away galaxy are still highly, highly entertaining.
12. *Khartoum* (1966) - This one may not count as an action movie, but it's still riveting and has top-drawer action scenes. During the Mahdist War, a British officer is dispatched to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to evacuate it in the face of a jihadist insurrection. Will he follow orders or dig in?
13. *The Great Escape* (1963) - Like the above film, it may not count as a true action movie, but it still demands a spot on the list. During World War II, Allied prisoners-of-war plot their breakout from the Nazi prison-camp they're being held in.
14. *The Killer* (1989) - A virtuous Hong Kong hitman goes on one last mission to pay for eye surgery for a woman he accidentally blinded.
15. *Duck, You Sucker* (1971) - A Mexican bandit and an Irish revolutionary team up to rob the Mesa Verde bank, but find themselves involved neck-deep in the Mexican Revolution.

Of course, there are other action masterpieces, but these are just personal favorites."
56206,"This is the obvious one, but mad Max fury road. Easily one of the best action movies I’ve ever seen. Raiders is also an all time great"
56207,"seconding Fury Road - action is non-stop from jump, no time to get bored!"
56208,"There are some action films that are highly acclaimed. The best historical examples I can think of would be some of Akira Kurosawa's samurai flicks, like **Seven Samurai**, **Yojimbo**, and **The Hidden Fortress**. There is also the Kurosawa-scripted **Runaway Train** from the late 1980s that is considered a minor classic.

Recently, you had **Mad Max: Fury Road** as the most acclaimed film of 2015. That was probably the most well-reviewed straight action film I can think of.

Sam Peckinpah was controversial in his time, but I think we can safely say that his best films are taken pretty seriously, and almost all of them feature action in some form or another: **The Wild Bunch**, **Straw Dogs**, **Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid**, **Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia**, **Cross of Iron**... some are a little more meditative than your typical action films, but are basically crossover ""arthouse action"".

I suppose you could argue that the classiest form of action film is the adventure film, where a lot of the ""action"" is more cerebral. **Lawrence of Arabia** comes to mind. John Huston's adventure films - **The Treasure of the Sierra Madre** and **The Man Who Would Be King** being my favorites - are held in very high honor. Maybe not exactly ""action"" films, but extremely high quality adventure films that contain some exciting action scenes.

I'd say that filmmakers like Ridley and Tony Scott made many prestige action films, too. Ridley's were maybe more appreciated by the critics at the time, but both their careers are spotted with action flicks that are given some scholarly weight nowadays. They made movies at an extremely high quality of craftsmanship that scholars find meaty in their themes and subject matter, so I think their best films probably fall into this category."
56209,">I suppose you could argue that the classiest form of action film is the adventure film, where a lot of the ""action"" is more cerebral. Lawrence of Arabia comes to mind

I love *Lawrence of Arabia*, but its not really an action film. To quote is co-star Omar Sharif, the film had ""no action, really, if you come to think of it"", and he's right. 

Whenever there's a potential for an action sequence, Lean plays it up less as fighting and more as a crowd scene: its not *action*, its *spectacle*. Indeed, during development, he encouraged his writers to downplay the fighting, asking sarcastically ""do we really want to make a western?!""

As for ""adventure"", it kind of is and kind of isn't. When O'Toole read an early draft he told Lean ""its the most marvellous adventure story"", to which Lean responded: ""Its *that* bad?"""
56210,"Interesting! I think I understand both perspectives. Lean's desire to not make a Western (ha!) or a conventional adventure film is evident, but I have to agree with O'Toole that the film is still stirring and exciting like an adventure film, it's just much more refined and cerebral."
56211,"Yeah, it ends in disillusion and tragedy, so it doesn't have that upbeat connotation that I certainly have with the term ""adventure"". It IS an adventure in the sense that it explores what was (for most of its audience at the time) an unseen corner of the world, but than, it was the age of Cinerama, and the film is almost a semi-travelogue.

As for action, I disagree with Lean that action somehow ""cheapens"" a movie. But I do still like the movie a lot, so. Bridge on the River Kwai is probably closer to being an action film."
56212,"Hard boiled, die hard, John wick trilogy, matrix trilogy, rambo 1 to 4, all the mission impossible movies, the rock, the killer, black mask, rush hour 1&2, demolition man, desperado, terminator 1&2, mad max road warrior and mad max fury road. Collateral, six underground, speed!"
56213,"Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Mummy 1 & 2"
56214,"Gonna throw some of my favorites in that I don't see here

Ong Bak (2003)

The Protector (2005)

Ronin (1998)

Undisputed III (2010)

The Man from Nowhere (2010)

Total Recall (1990)"
56215,"Besides the many mentioned, Mission Impossible:Fallout is fairly exceptional."
56216,Die Hard and Fury Road
56217,Western genre basically have action and great narrative. John Ford and Sergio Leone are known for developing art house Westerns that blends in great narrative and action. Then we have George Miller’s Mad Max films which combines the artsy stuff and action. I believe Stallone’s First Blood part 1 was basically a art house action film.
56218,"John Wick
Die Hard
Commando
Raiders of the Lost Ark
Point Break 


Heat has the one of the best bank robbery scenes ever on film but the movie itself isn’t an action film"
56219,all Jason Bourne except Legacy
56220,"I'd definitely include Early Jackie Chan Hong Kong films such as:

Police Story(s)

Armour of God

Drunken Master

etc.

Star Wars films.

LOTR

Natural Born Killers"
56221,Speed
56222,"Fury Road is the standard all others are judged by for me. 

MI Fallout is about as good as mainstream gets otherwise."
56223,Rambo First Blood.
56224,Rush Hour
56225,"*The Raid* and *The Raid 2* are what I would consider to be the best action movies of all time, especially the second. *Hard-Boiled* is also really good if you like Gun-Fu. *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,* *A Touch of Zen,* and *Shadow* are amazing Wuxia movies. *Bourne* trilogy and the *John Wick*  trilogy are the best out of the United States in my opinion. *Skyfall* and *Casino Royale* are excellent, they have opposite cinematography, yet both are still amazing."
56226,Raiders of the Lost Ark.
56227,"Side note: Raiders has one of my favorite scenes from a movie, when Jones is running from the natives with the idol in tow, and he's trying to get Jock to start the plane in time."
56228,"That whole opening sequence was great.

My favorite scene is when he shoots the swordsman."
56229,"Am I the only one that likes Last Crusade more than Raiders? Love them both, but Crusade just feels a little smoother with better dialogue."
56230,Last crusade while I like it a lot is a Raiders rehash with more sitcom humor. I actually prefer temple over crusade.
56231,First movie I thought of when I saw the the post title
56232,Came here to say this. No other answer
56233,The undisputable one.
56234,"If adventure had a name, it would be Indiana Jones."
56235,"Best movie tagline, possibly ever.

Honorable mention to *Pacific Rim*: Go Big Or Go Extinct."
56236,Raiders of the Lost Ark with The Empire Strikes Back a close second.
56237,Mummy is one of the best not called Indiana Jones. I'm also a huge fan of the National treasure movies.
56238,"I love National Treasure and have been wanting NT3 for a long time.  But I only love it because Nicolas Cage is so absurd in them, especially in part 2."
56240,The Goonies.
56241,I don't know about best ever but my favorite is Time Bandits.
56242,Back to the Future
56243,"I second BTTF. It's not about a location, it's about getting back...to the future! Time travel adventure can't be replicated without comparing the OG. Amazing."
56244,"Temple of Doom!

Romancing the Stone"
56245,"An oldie but a goodie - The Man Who Would Be King (1975) - Michael Caine & Sean Connery 

96% on Rotten Tomatoes
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_who_would_be_king/"
56246,One of my favorite movies of all time. Glad someone put this on here. Couldn't recommend it more.
56248,"King Kong!

Edit: I actually had the original 1933 one in mind."
56249,I actually really like it. What's the general consensus?
56250,"I think Kong Kong definitely features in there. There is quite a lot of adventure in it. I consider Jacksons King Kong the best one, and it is full of adventure"
56251,"Yeah, the Peter Jackson one is the one I meant. I know it's a little long, but I love every second of it"
56252,I don't get why people hate on it so much. It's a really good movie
56253,"I didn't care for it because it's a movie full of meaningless action in a film that didn't feel like that's what it ""should have"" been, if that makes any sense.  I actually liked Kong: Skull Island a lot because it felt like an action film on every level; for Jackson's King Kong, I don't know, I needed more gravitas from almost everyone cast in that movie and I can't say I was satisfied with anyone."
56254,"MAny good suggestions here. But I think Raiders is thr definitive adventure movie. 

Surprised to see no love for Pirates 1. It has to be in the top 10 adventure movies ever."
56255,"Curse of the Black Pearl is really well done, very fun, and hugely entertaining, but on its own I think it's an above average to great movie; it's the sequels that I think skew fondness for it in hindsight, which isn't to say I agree as I think Dead Man's Chest is the best of that franchise."
56256,"I love DMC. But as a movie Curse is almost perfect. I would put it slightly below Raiders. Behind all the fun, the script is an excellent one."
56257,Ehh.
56258,What do you mean by ehh?
56259,[Ehh.](https://imgur.com/vxofAAB)
56260,About Indy statement or Pirates one?
56261,Yea
56262,What fuckery is this?
56263,Spirited Away.
56264,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is my pick. Taika Waititi is a genius, and this film is no exception. It's emotional as hell, and really fun too."
56265,Willow.
56266,"What did you say, Peck?"
56267,Some movies are better left in the recesses of childhood memories.
56268,"I love Raiders but i was at the right age to see The Last Crusade in theaters and i'll never forget it for me its my all time #1. it had both Bond and Indiana,and it also had a knight and sick desert battle

*We named the dog Indiana*"
56269,Stand by me. Classic.
56270,"Adding *The Adventures of Baron Munchausen* to this thread. 

Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the GOAT but I love this movie."
56271,Another pick would be Bourne Identity. Pure awesomeness.
56273,You fuckin nuts? You got the wrong guy pal.
56275,"Enough of this fuckery. Next time you make a wromg claim, I am reporting you."
56276,Probably not the best but I love Romancing the Stone
56277,DELIVERANCE!
56278,I personally like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
56279,"Last of the Mohicans is a great adventure film, and an almost perfect movie. And now I'll be whistling that third act theme all afternoon."
56280,"By your definition, either Lord of the Rings or the original Star Wars.  Not sure if anything else comes close."
56281,LOTR is more of a long walk than an adventure
56282,Lotr is too self serious and heavy for to really be an adventure. It's also too slow.
56283,Castle in the Sky
56284,"It's not the best, but National Treasure is just so damn watchable."
56285,Explorers
56286,"If ""The Wizard of Oz"" can be considered an adventure film, I would add that one."
56287,Thelma and Louise.
56288,"Ladyhawke, man. Such a great story!"
56289,It's kind of depressing that just about every movie on this list is like 30 years old.  Is this really a genre that Hollywood just can't do (well) anymore?
56290,"Still old, but Pirates trilogy did adventure very well. The plotting may be an issue, but while watching all 3, I always felt I was on an epic adventure as well. Whether it was rescuing Elizabeth, or finding Davy Jones's chest, or bringing Jack Sparrow back from the locker, the series is pure adventure at its core. Hard to see why it does not get much love. Maybe because 4 and 5 are shit."
56291,"Despite some seriously dated effects, Where Eagles Dare is still one helluva film."
56292,I mean I know I should say Raiders of the lost Ark but I really love The Goonies
56293,"*Raiders of the Lost Ark* (and *Last Crusade*). But also *Silverado*, also written by Lawrence Kasdan."
56294,The Little Mermaid
56295,"I've always thought this was a hard question to answer, so I eventually boiled it down to what sort of *experience* I had in the theater, when I first saw it. Pure adrenaline. Pure thrills. Had me just grinning from ear to ear. And that experience has only happened to me, at that level, maybe 3-4 times.

First was *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Unsurprising.

That feeling happened to me again when I saw *Die Hard* for the first time. Only time I ever turned right around, bought a ticket and walked back in to see it again.

Third time was *The Mask of Zorro*. That turned it into a 3-way tie that lasted a very, very long time.

Recently, it happened with *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Mad Max: Fury Road*, so very high marks and honorable mention for each of them."
56296,"Other than anything Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone is fantastic."
56297,"Most of the films listed here are 15+ years old, so I'm trying to add some newer ones.  If animated films count, then Up! should be on the list in my opinion.  Also, Interstellar seems like it should count, unless you'd put it too far into the fantasy category instead."
56298,"Lawrence of Arabia
The Hidden Fortress
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"
56299,The NeverEnding Story
56301,Last Crusade. Ford and Connery have perfect chemistry and the action scenes are amazing
56302,Interstellar
56303,Has to be The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Hands down.
56304,"Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit. They cover several different areas, following a variety of characters undergoing their own challenges. And bilbo straight up tells us he's going on an adventure!"
56305,"Star Wars...nothing comes close.

I never realized before that all the main characters in episode 4 are introduced on/around Tatooine."
56306,The first one that come to mind for me is It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963).  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057193/.

56727,"I was just about to buy that when the sale expired on me at midnight. ~~So to everyone west of CST, buy it now if you want to get the discount (if it hasn't gone into effect further west yet)!~~ Nevermind, sale is over everywhere :("
56728,"West coast here (PST). Price is back up to $180, unfortunately!"
56729,Damnit!
56730,Don't fret too much. It seems like it was around $99 just a few weeks ago too. The deal may come back again in the near future. :) You can set up deal alerts for that.
56731,"Hm, maybe. But I got to thinking, I sit across from a window when using my PC and a glossy screen might be pretty annoying anyway. In any case I don't need a monitor right away vOv"
56732,So I just bought an Asus VE247H from a Microcenter which is about 45 minutes from me. Box is unopened so I'm wondering if it is worth the drive to return it so I can buy this Acer IPS which looks amazing
56733,"Damn, bought it for $120 a month or two ago. Great monitor (that I'm using to type this). I'd definitely recommend it."
56734,"You use your monitor to type? I mean,  I use a keyboard, but you do you I guess."
56735,"I have this and it's great. The only downside is that, because of the type of display it is(I don't know why this is so i'll sound like an idiot), when you're playing a dark game and there's even a slight bit of light in your room, the screen is very reflective. For example, playing rust and it turns to night time, i Can't see anything unless it's dark outside IRL. So turning up gamma is a must for dark games, but an awesome monitor nonetheless."
56736,"Some glossy monitors do this. My dell monitor does it too, when I play The Long Dark."
56737,Glossy was the word i was looking for! thank you.
56738,"I am for^eever ^your's, faithfully..."
56739,"I'm very happy with my Acer. They've been making great screens lately, even though their hinges on laptops are still crap."
56740,I have two of these currently and am keeping an eye out for a third. They're both great monitors.
56741,i looks like it doesnt have vesa mounts does it? or so you have the regular stands?
56742,"It doesn't support Vesa from the factory, however adapters are available from Amazon and the like."
56743,"Same, very happy with mine and overclockable to 75 Hz"
56744,I couldn't be more happy with the price ($130~) I paid for one of these.
56745,"Second this. Picked it up from jet.com for like $95, and regularly is ~$100. My GF loves it, but you get what you pay for. It's a lower end IPS panel, but better than others at the price."
56746,I stand by this monitor. I have two and love em
56747,"I got the 24"" ones for $80 off each a while back. These displays look amazing!"
56748,"Have it, love it. I have it overclocked to 75Hz over HDMI using EVGA PrecisionX. Only minor complaint I have is a bit of ghosting but I almost never notice it in game."
56749,"How do I know if mine is overclockable?
I have a similar monitor, not sure if it's the same exact model though."
56750,"It's just a matter of trial and error. I kept going til my monitor black screened @80Hz and waited til the display reverted to the last stable state. The only thing to look for when overclocking your monitor to see if it's successful is to move around the mouse cursor.  

Is the mouse skipping frames? Stop there and go back 2Hz unless it wont go over 60/62Hz without it skipping frames.  
  
Is it still smooth? Keep going til frame skips are noticeable or screen goes black."
56751,"I picked these up two years ago on sale at Best Buy for $125. They were $179 at the time on Amazon and I went to BB to use them as my Amazon showroom, discovered the sale, left with three. 

Only downside, no VESA mount. 

My solution [was this](http://i.imgur.com/wSI0qkw.jpg) …

… but thanks to this current post, I just learned about [THESE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01771PJFK/)!!!"
56752,I have two of the 21.5 inch versions of this. Great monitors.
56753,"Yep, I have two of these.  They're also overclockable to 76Hz which is nice."
56754,"https://www.amazon.com/Acer-R240HY-bidx-23-8-Inch-Widescreen/dp/B0148NNKTC

Acer R240 in the same ""entertainment category"" but with smaller bezel and only a vga cord."
56755,"The H236HL has impeccable image quality for the price (it'd be hard not to with a glossy IPS display) and reasonable color calibration, but it's not great for fast gaming. Due to high pixel response times, pixel overshoot and PWM backlighting, it exhibits wicked amounts of motion blur in fast-paced FPS like TF2. 

It's also an Acer product, so the QC is sub-par. Mine already has 3-4 bright/dark spots. Not just stuck pixels, but what seems like actual irregularities in the backlight or polarising layer. Very hard to notice unless inspecting the monitor up-close however.

Nonetheless, it's a good all-rounder for the typical asking price of 99 USD, but if you're into competitive CSGO/TF2, it's a no-go."
56756,"Not sure if Overwatch counts as fast paced, but I haven't noticed any of the things you've mentioned while playing it quite competitively for about 40 hours so far."
56757,"In the review, Linus states that it isn't all that reflective, but it still looked pretty glaring to me.  I don't like very much glare on my monitors, and I was wondering how it is for you.  Any issues when playing in a well-lit room?  Aside from this issue I have, it looks like a fabulous monitor."
56759,"Glad it's working well for you.  I think I'll run in to my local Best Buy, and see if they have any on display that I can look at.  At $99 from them, this seems like a steal."
56760,"I have two of [these](https://www.amazon.com/AOC-I2267FW-22-Inch-Frameless-Brightness/dp/B00CLZ047Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468252934&sr=8-1&keywords=aoc+i2267fw) and they look amazing for the price! It has an IPS panel so the colors are very vibrant. 

FYI: Only DVI and VGA but a both of mine use HDMI to DVI cables"
56761,I like that one! What is the refresh rate?
56762,"60Hz, I have seen no input lag or image degradation over the year I have had them either"
56763,"Also, While it may not be VESA mountable there are VESA converter mounts like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Bracket-i2367Fh-i2757Fh-i2267Fw/dp/B01A3XDIQQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468253283&sr=8-1&keywords=aoc+i2267fw+vesa)"
56764,I have [this similar one](https://www.amazon.com/AOC-i2367Fh-23-Inch-Frameless-LED-Lit/dp/B009V8F700/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468272545&sr=8-1&keywords=aoc+i2367fh) because I wanted one with speakers and I'm pretty happy with it. They are both 60hz.
56765,"I have the barebones i2369V since it was $30 cheaper. It's been great but I wish I had spent $300 on the 34"" LG 34UM57 IPS UltraWide"
56766,I got two of these for my friend's build earlier this year and he loved them!
56767,I've got one of those too. bought it for $110 back in 2014
56769,I have 1 of these and I'm looking to find a sale to pick up a couple more:) these come highly recommended OP
56770,"I picked up one of these the other day at Best Buy for $99. If they are on sale near you, I highly recommend it.

56772,Can confirm. I have 2 of those monitors and I love them! They have a glossy display tho just so you know.
56773,"I have a Dell u2715h, but part of me has considered picking up a pair to use in tandem with my laptop, or maybe get some for my girlfriend to use with her laptop. Then I realize I've got adult financial responsibilities and I cry"
56774,I literally bought this one an hour ago from Best Buy for my build that I'll be putting together tomorrow. It looked noticeably more vibrant than the other displays and the size is perfect!
56775,"Congrats! 24"" is a pretty good size for a standalone 1080p. I hope you enjoy it"
56776,"I have this and love this. Blacks could be better, but it's a cheap display. It definitely has a lot of reflection, so wouldn't use it anywhere there's a lot of sunlight coming in."
56777,"I bought one two weeks ago when it went on sale for $99. Loved it but when I went to get another it went back to original $179. Now after browsing my front page, I ordered my second. Lots of love Reddit <3"
56778,"Not sure if its considered ""the best"" but I love the bezel and overall look of the [Acer R240HY](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-R240HY-bidx-23-8-Inch-Widescreen/dp/B0148NNKTC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468259646&sr=8-1&keywords=acer+r240hy)"
56779,i got a BenQ EW2440L about 7 months ago and i really can't recommend it enough.
56780,anyone know what the difference from LG Monitor like (lg 22m47vq & 22m47vq-p)? What is P means. Thanks
56781,"I think P means that the monitor stand would be glossy and black, non-P versions are the transparent stands (or is it the other way around). Eitherway there's no technical difference between the two, only aesthetic diffences."
56783,"The Acer KN242HYL often goes on Newegg for $109.99.

56784,"250 budget? 

How about a 29"" LG ultrawide? Ther is a 25"" one, and while some people find it small, it suits my desk size perfectly and I find it amazing over 16:9 monitors."
56785,How about 27 INCHES! http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824160168
56786,"I use the HP 22cwa and I think it's pretty good. The stand isn't the best (it's a bit wobbly) but it's IPS, 1920x1080, and 21.5"", which makes the screen look sharper compared to, say, a 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen."
56787,"https://smile.amazon.com/Asus-VG248QE-24-inch-Ergonomic-Back-lit/dp/B00B2HH7G0?ie=UTF8&tag=pcpapi-20

If your budget is up to $250 that ASUS monitor supports up to 144Hz so if you are playing more competitive/eSports type games they will be much smoother if your GPU is capable.

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236722&nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-PCPartPicker,%20LLC-_-na-_-na-_-na&cm_sp=&AID=10446076&PID=3938566&SID=

Is similar to the first option, but offer FreeSync, if you are using an AMD video card. Also just a little be more expensive and may be out of your budget.

https://smile.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX2757-MHD-DisplayPort-FreeSync-Technology/dp/B01A0ZRRCI?ie=UTF8&tag=pcpapi-20

Two options from ViewSonic 24"" for $160 and 27"" for $220. Both are 1080p so be aware that the larger screen isn't higher resolution. This doesn't make a huge difference in gaming, IMO, but windows and text in a browser might seem larger than typical if used to a 24"" 1080p monitor.

Both support FreeSync and go up to 75Hz. Obviously not as high as 120 or 144, but its still a noticeably and welcome improvement to 60Hz.

https://smile.amazon.com/AOC-G2460PF-24-Inch-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B01BV1XBEI?ie=UTF8&tag=pcpapi-20

Final option here, AOC 24"" 1080p with FreeSync and refresh rates up to 144Hz. If refresh rate is a high priority this is the most affordable option to get the highest refresh rates available today. It also comes with a pretty robust stand that allows it to be raise quite high, and rotated vertically. Seems to hit all the features for a great price and reviews seem to be quite favorable."
56788,Thank you for including monitors with freesync!!
56789,"You missed the [Acer GN246HL 24"" 144hz](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00KO4518I/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=DMLBNNVFDP2P&coliid=I9J023VWZJY6M) as competition for the VG248QE. Crossing my fingers for a Prime Day sale on either of them tomorrow!"

56792,"The LG UM57 25UM57 Ultrawide monitor goes for $180 on Amazon. Although it's above your budget slightly, it's a great monitor."

Maybe you can check out the used (or refurbished) market for one of those."
56795,look for refurnished monitors. Alot of times they're not even refurbished but instead just open box monitors that were brand new and returned.

56799,I saved almost every fucking comment on this thread hahah

56865,It tastes like it's been filtered through a dirty sock.
56866,That's because they put salt in it. One time I got a bottle that I guess had gotten more salt than usual because it actually tasted like straight up sea water. That was when I looked at the ingredients and found out they put salt in it. I refuse to drink dasani ever since then.

56875,"Oh, I have OPINIONS on water!

The best I’ve ever had was the tap water in Paris. I like to get Italian waters sometimes to try and replicate that taste.

If I’m just grabbing something, or buying in bulk, I’ll usually get Crystal Geyser, as I like the taste and it’s cheap. If they don’t have it, I’ll spring for Fiji.

I try fancy waters whenever I see a new one, but none really stand out to me. I do like Voss in the glass bottle though.

Once in a while I get Dasani, but only ice cold. It has an almost chlorine taste to it, but sometimes I like that.

I won’t but Arrowhead or Aquafina, I don’t like the taste of either. Smart Water does not even deserve to have water in its name.

(My tap water is unfortunately unpalatable, so I buy bottled water so I’ll actually drink some- as you can see, I’m sensitive to water taste!)"

On the other hand, I like all sorts of (to me) strange mineral waters. I grew up in a town famed for its mineral springs, so I like all the high-mineral, salty-tasting waters. My favorite one right now is called Borsec, from Romania. I've only had one water ever that was too salty for me, and it was from the same Russian store I get the Borsec from, but I can't remember its name. I'd love to tell you all what it's called, so you can avoid it in the future."

56896,"There's a local grocery chain with the cheapest off-brand bottled water. Its definitely tap water from somewhere, but it beats my local municipal water which tastes like chlorine, and that bottled water tastes the most like properly treated city water of any bottled water I've had.


But, other than that, a properly treated and kept well impossible to beat. Well water has all of the minerals that water should, the only danger is of course if it becomes contaminated.


Also, Disani is shit."
56897,"Wissahickon Mountain Spring Water, which no longer exists. It had this great slightly sweet taste to it, probably the soft plastic bottle (frosted) it was sold in. We had it at Penn State in the vending machines. It got sold to Nestle over a decade ago and no longer exists. 

The well water from my parents house, when you'd let it run cold for a good minute first, or over ice made from the same water. Also no longer possible, a huge development was put in and it ruined the water shed, everyone had to covert to city water from well water."
