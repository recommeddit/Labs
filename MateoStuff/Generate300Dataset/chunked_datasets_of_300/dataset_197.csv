65206,"Thank you, Bliss149, I appreciate your comment and will use it as fuel for motivation :)"
65207,Nice job Stetson as usual.  But you left out the best plan as far as I can see...the $300 yearly 8GB prioritized AT&T Prepaid plan.  Maybe I just missed it or maybe you only included monthly plans?
65208,"It's there! It's called ""AT&T Prepaid 8GB Annual"" and in row 116 in the ""All Plans"" view. $25/mo for 8GB is a pretty good deal on the AT&T network."
65209,"Ok I missed it but you have so many. Lol. 

Reason I like so well is you get all the extras...HD video, hotspot, rollover, VVM, Canada/Mexico, etc...  About the only thing not included is 5G.  Also, by getting discounted pins my renewal price was only $258 or $21.15 per month üòÜ"
65210,That is such a good deal! How did you get the discount? It sounds like you were able to find sales on AT&T Prepaid refill cards?
65211,"Actually AT&T offers $25 discount when you renew over 30 days early.  Then I got refill cards at Target buy one get one 10% off plus my RedCard adds another 5% discount.  The trick is to get the exact amount worth of cards with discount.   
I believe I got (4) $70 cards which would be $280 minus $14 discount and then another $13.30 off for the RedCard discount made a total of  price of $252.70 for $280 worth of pins.  Pretty sure the extra $5 expired and dropped off.   

I joined Sept 2019 and renewed this past August.  Not sure if this is regular pricing for renewals or what, but my account now shows $275 due Sept 21, 2021 with no mention of renewing 30 days early this time. [pic](https://i.imgur.com/kvuioP1.png)   Great deal for excellent service if you can get by on 8GB."
65212,Is that buy one get one 10% off a regular promotion at target?
65213,Yes they run it at least 6-8 times per year...usually for a week but sometimes it runs a couple weeks.  It was just ran like 3 weeks ago so it'll likely be a month or so.
65214,How is your data speed? It doesnt explicitly state what its data speeds are.
65215,No 5G but I get very good LTE speed.  As high as 120 Mb at times but mostly in the 40-70 range.  On occasion I will see around 10 or so at worse but that's rarely.  Uploads are always good as well.
65216,"I know you posted this a while ago, but piggybacking since I'm looking into the plan: it is deprioritized data, though per the spreadsheet, correct?"
65217,"My understanding was that AT&T prepaid was deprioritized, although I may be mistaken about this. I've heard some people comment that just the AT&T Prepaid Unlimited plan is deprioritized. The prepaid plans with set data amounts along with the Unlimited Plus plan may actually have priority data."
65218,"I agree the AT&T plan is one of the best [cheap cell phone plans](https://dailygizmo.net/cheap-cell-phone-plans/) it is sort of like one of those limited/unlimited plans since it switches to I think 2G data if you exceed your limit.  In terms of network coverage, pricing, speed, data, major provider I think that might be one of the best plans out there are the moment.  I got it for my son.  Works great so far."
65219,Easily one of the most anticipated posts on this sub. Thanks for the list u/stetson. It's a resource we point users to when our plans are not a good fit. Just keep an eye out for a major release from us tomorrow.
65220,üëÄ
65221,"Stetson,

Thanks for your work.  I think you should add USMobile Pooled plans.  They really change the game for low data users.  $9 for unlimited talk and text + $2/GB data.  The fact that one can add data as needed in the middle of month is wonderful.  For us retirees two lines with 1 GB pooled data per month costs only $10.49 per month.  How can that be beat on Verizon network?"
65222,"Thanks for this, Stetson, and all that you do for us cell phone consumers!

A few suggestions to add on to your sheet:

* The QCI of Red Pocket AT&T is 8 (for the 30 GB monthly GSMA plan)
* The QCI of Boom AT&T is 8 (for the 450 MB trial plan on ""Blue"")"
65223,What about Ultra Mobile's PayGo $3/month plan?
65224,"Yes, and Red Pocket's $30/360 days (= $2.50/month)?"
65226,"This is brilliant. I'd love for this is to turn into an interactive chatbot that can help users filter down to find the best plans that fit their needs.

I've looked at ChatFuel, HelpScout, [ChatBot.com](https://ChatBot.com), Flox XO, Mobile Monkey, Flow.ia, and Intercom. Last time I looked into this my top pick was ChatFuel for around $15/mo.

My delays are figuring out the best chat software/tool, cost, and the logic flow for setting it all up. I feel like expanding to Canada, Mexico, and European plans, along with continuing to produce YouTube videos are my current priorities. 

Definitely open to ideas on this though. Maybe I'm overthinking it or overcomplicating it?"
65227,I wish there was something that could be done to get esim unlocked on the s20.
65228,"Don‚Äôt we all. And unfortunately it looks like Samsung is doing the same thing with the S21. The eSIM is disabled on my unlocked model, and when I chatted with support [I was told](https://twitter.com/stetsondoggett/status/1354855533652570112?s=21) eSIM would be enabled sometime ‚Äúmid 2021.‚Äù 

Anyway, I‚Äôm personally feeling hugely disappointed by this. So glad I‚Äôm not the only one wishing eSIM would be enabled on the Galaxy devices!"
65229,Update hello use T mobile network now
65230,"Awesome, thanks for confirming."
65231,"Also, the $25 hello mobile plan requires $15 hotspot charge, not included."
65232,"Stetson, this list shows an incredible amount of work. Great job!! I used to try to maintain a much smaller list but gave up with all of the changes that happen in the prepaid sector. This was before T-Mobile greatly expanded their network so I didn't include T-Mobile plans at that time due to coverage. I've been a prepaid customer since 2008 and I've tried quite a few providers since then. I've looked at your latest update to your chart and I see that you list Ultra Mobile's $39/m 50gb plan but you don't recommend it. I'm just curious as to why you don't. Have you not tried the plan yet? I see it as similar as US Mobile's 'unlimited all' except the taxes are less and it includes hotspot, international text and some international calling. It doesn't include international roaming like US Mobile does but that seems to be the only downside. I think it compares very well to the US Mobile All Unlimited plans on Verizon but at the lowest price point."
65233,"In regards to that specific plan, I probably felt Mint Mobile was a better value, or that it was worth going with T-Mobile prepaid directly and getting their true unlimited data plan for $50 per month."
65234,After reading your response I actually agree. While my experience on Ultra was good it is no longer the value that it was. Their promo rate for the 'unlimited' plan expired. I'm moving to US Mobile with 3 lines in 1-2 months for the Unlimited All (2 on Super LTE and 1 on GSM LTE). I found their customer support to be very good and responsive and with the new family plan rates it is really hard to beat those prices. The experience on Super LTE has been good. I haven't tested the GSM LTE network yet but I will soon.
65235,"Thanks to your table, I was able to discover Visible... and it's awesome... YOU'RE AWESOME."
65236,I appreciate your comment! Thank you!
65237,Coming in totally late but just discovered this chart. Are you still enjoying Visible?
65238,You are my hero!
65239,"I believe all US Mobile esim data only plans expire after one month. Or can you point where you saw it lasts till used? At the very least they charge $2 esim fee every month.

Only Dent has long term annual esim data."
65240,"Thanks for this. But your info about Red Pocket Mobile Family Plan are not updated. They offer a family plan up to 5 sims with 10GB of LTE data each and then controlled speed, which is actually pretty convient, as you have 5 lines for 110$ with 10Gb LTE each..."
65241,"I have ATT prepaid unlimited (not unlimited plus). My phone has the option of turning on a hotspot, but since I don't have the unlimited plus plan, will I be charged if I use the hotspot? I tried calling ATT to ask but can't get through."
65242,Why is usmobile listed as not having wifi calling?  They even have a page for how to use it: https://www.usmobile.com/blog/what-is-wifi-calling/
65243,"Because WiFi calling is currently only available for Android phones on the GSM LTE network. I feel that is a minority use case, and that US Mobile is actually a better value on the Super LTE network where WiFi calling is not yet supported, so I have chosen to leave WiFi calling off for US Mobile."
65244,"It's wild looking at your unfiltered list with US Mobile's new plans. They really are becoming one of the best options out there. After your podcast with the CEO, I'm excited to hear what they have coming up this year. I got in on Mint's $90 6 months unlimited in January, so I'll be in the market once that's up."
65245,"hi Stetson, this is great! Looks like I will need to spend quite a bit of time looking this over.

Perhaps you are familiar with Howard B‚Äôs site at [https://prepaidcompare.net](https://prepaidcompare.net/) ? I found that a while back, and find it quite easy to sort thru the plans there. I haven‚Äôt used Airtable before, seems powerful but harder to use the user interface. I‚Äôll work on it.

I‚Äôve been using MVNO‚Äôs since 2011. Finally bought a flagship phone (iPhone 12 Mini) and am trying to find better service for it. Lately I had been using Teltik, but they seemed to have a bit of a meltdown.

My quest is to find some combination of service(s) that will give me a working phone whenever there is some kind of signal. (I spend a lot of time out in the woods in northern Michigan) So I‚Äôm trying to cover the big 3 carriers. Then I ran across the concept of ‚Äúdomestic roaming‚Äù on [prepaidcompare.net](http://prepaidcompare.net/) and am trying to find out the techical details on that.

As an example, I currently have Visible, that seems to cover me for Verizon. I saw that Ting offered T Mobile service, and maybe also roams onto something? Or ATT Prepaid has an annual plan that includes roaming, but haven‚Äôt been able to find what it roams onto?

Anyway, your research and sites seem very valuable. Thank you!"
65246,"Thank you so much for this. You and whoever else contributes to this list.

I just discovered MVNOs. Also that online excel sheet is so easy to use with multiple filters and sorts."
65247,You are very welcome! I am glad you have found the comparison chart helpful :)
65248,"I think I just stumbled on another one to add to the list: [https://www.speedtalkmobile.com/plans](https://www.speedtalkmobile.com/plans).  I noticed them because of their 3[0day prepaid sim card on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Card-Preloaded-Month-Service-Contract/dp/B075THY4JY/ref=pd_cart_sspa_dk_ct_pt_sub_1_4/131-5147139-8462316?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B075THY4JY&pd_rd_r=cf4693e5-e415-4610-8abb-7147ad6e4ccd&pd_rd_w=gLcjx&pd_rd_wg=3hcsS&pf_rd_p=e43b9dec-ae9b-46f1-8532-2caf5d19eb49&pf_rd_r=SG421WF0E3DY9QM42FH7&psc=1&refRID=SG421WF0E3DY9QM42FH7&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExUk4xU004NkQwTko1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzM2NzY4MUQzMDBWMFZZM0YwUiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzAyOTIxMkM5SlMxTzNUVFBRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfY2FydF9wZXJjb2xhdGUmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl).  I haven't looked through the fine print yet, but if anyone needs a wireless intermediary to move a landline to google voice, this looks like a good candidate."
65249,"Great resource. Definitely going to come back to this in a few months when I look for something to take hiking/camping/to the lake/etc instead of my nice, expensive phone."
65250,"Heyo mashed potato! A couple of things I notice missing:

1) The Red Pocket $30/year plan for Sprint-network devices available through eBay only. 

2) Red Pocket automatic activation promo for Sprint devices on the 10GB plan - first month is $3 and you can change any time to a lower cost plan before your ‚Äúalmost free‚Äù month expires.

I was going to write a Reddit post blog-style about both, but maybe I‚Äôll leave that to you for your site üòÉ

I have been testing different older Sprint devices (Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy SIII, HTC ONE M8, etc) with stock ROMs vs custom ROMs using RedPocket as the carrier."
65251,"Thank you for this wonderful resource!

I think there's a correction to be made. The table says Unreal mobile offers international data roaming as an add-on, but [according to their website](https://help.unrealmobile.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042875731-Does-UNREAL-Mobile-allow-roaming-) this is not true. Could we get this updated?"
65252,"Thank you for the heads up! Unreal Mobile must have removed the perk. Very strange. They were bought by Red Pocket, and for a while they included the exact same ""Explorer"" and ""Jetsetter"" international data roaming [add-on options](https://www.redpocket.com/global). What's curious to me is that Unreal Mobile still appears to offer free international calling 80+ countries. I wonder why they would remove the international add-ons? Heck, even [Freedompop](https://www.freedompop.com/global) still offers Red Pocket's international roaming add-ons.

Either way, thank you again for bringing this to my attention. I'll get the plans updated ASAP in time for an August update."
65253,"Thanks, Stetson! I'm sub'd."
65254,"This is a cool chart! Hello, Mr. Stetsdogg. I have a question for you.   
When the carrier states multiple carriers is that in list of priority for that plan?  
Thanks!"
65255,"Hey there, if a carrier has multiple networks, it means that you can choose which network you want when you sign up. No carrier, besides Google Fi, is able to automatically switch between networks. You just get service on the one network you sign up for."
65256,oh i see what you mean. that makes  a lot of sense!  thank you very much for that explanation. this chart has been BIG for me. super helpful in finding some really cool carriers. thanks!!
65257,"I've neglected to thank you for this list. For that, apologies. Thank you so much. 

I discovered a mvno that does not deprioritize called Pulse Cellular and runs all three major networks. Pricey but perhaps a better deal than many post paid plans. 

Thans again."
65258,"Stetson, I just want to say thank you for all you do! I watch your channel regularly and love how well laid out your site is when comparing plans. Keep up the great work!"
65260,"1. You are welcome! I'm glad you found it helpful. I realized that was the way I liked to find & compare plans, so I figured other people may like it, too. 

2. I think you're thinking of OnlyFans? Either way, yeah, my Patron is basically behind the scenes of videos, ad-free podcast episodes, and a cool community on Discord."
65261,great post! considering saving $60 a year by getting redpocket.
65262,"New phone user! How much would a SIM card cost ? I might just buy a new phone since the one I have has a battery draining problem(ip7). As a student, I probably need unlimited data since I‚Äôm bad with directions."
65263,USmobile and others will send out a sim for free generally
65264,Just wondering where than RedPocket $30 annual plan went on here. That's the one I'm on now that it's using the T-Mobile network.
65265,"Nice work

Wondering if anyone on xfinity family plan and do have an open spot to join?"
65266,"Thanks! Something I noticed; shouldn't visible party pay always be $25 per person no matter how many lines? Because you can join random people's parties? Or have a separate row for example:

1 line + 3 randoms = $25 per person

2 lines + 2 randoms = $25 per person 

..."
65267,"I understand what you are saying, however I feel it makes more sense to list Visible as-is. Some people, for whatever reason, may feel uncomfortable joining a party with strangers. I think it's best to list the price as-is and try to promote the Party Pay discount so people are aware of it."
65268,"I'm curious about this ""party"" thing with Visible. There are subreddits set up for joining Visible parties. Some of them have more than a 1,000 people in them. Is there any downside to being in such a party? Can the other people in the party bug you or bother you somehow?  


If there's no real downside to being in a party of 1,000 random people, it seems the $25/month price should be reflected prominently in the spreadsheet somehow. This price makes the service ***very*** attractive."
65269,"There is no downside to being part of a Visible Party. No member can see your phone number. No member will have any way to contact you. You may get an email if new members join, I know I did for a bit, but I unsubscribed and no longer receive those. In fact, even though I created a party with 1,400+ members in it, I don't receive any notifications for it. 

As far as I'm concerned, Visible Parties have only upsides‚Äì‚Äìsaving you an extra $15 per month on your cell phone bill. I'm still unsure of the best way to represent it in the chart. For now, it is technically a $40 unlimited plan, and I wouldn't want to list it as $25 and have people be upset their first bill is $40. But you raise an excellent point."
65270,"Thanks for the 411!

I did notice that you listed the cost as being $25/month in a different column, but it's pretty far off to the right, and I didn't know what to make of that when I first saw it.

Maybe the price could be listed as $25-$40, or something. Though I guess that would mess up sorting the column by price. D'oh!"
65271,"Ah, yes! The column with the $25 price is the ""Estimated Total Price"" column. Not every plan has an estimated total price, as I try to only list that price if I have an idea for the taxes and fees, but maybe it would make sense to move that column to right after the price column?"
65272,"It ***would*** make sense to have that ""Estimated Total Price"" column right next to the price column since that column is actually what I care about the most. The fees between different services are so disparate. Some charge no extra fees and some charge like $6 or $7 extra per month!

P.S. Thanks for all the hard work on that spreadsheet. You've done a remarkable job!"
65273,"Stetsdogg hey I was thinking of another area of your site you could add. Tablet plans. If I am totally blind please say so. I have the AT&T iPad plan and love it. But would love to know what other options are out there.

Also huge fan of you and your site! I wish I had chosen to do what you did when I was doing all my research a few years ago but you are doing such a fabulous job at it. You take care!"
65274,"Thanks! I do have hotspot plans listed on my website, they are just a little tricky to find. You can view [all hotspot plans here](https://www.bestphoneplans.net/all-hotspot-plans)."
65275,"Thanks, this info is desperately needed. There are about three questions a day looking for hotspot plans. Most are looking for unlimited data and can't believe that, with rare exceptions and caveats, nobody is selling unlimited high speed for hundreds of GB a month."
65276,Sadly the mobile hotspot plans are still dook. I'm going to have to go through ATT and do 40GB for $75 :/
65277,hello stets brother
65278,Hello hello
65279,i really like your name (ive contacted every stets)
65280,"Great update, thanks for doing.  FYI US Mobile just upped its plans to 1, 5, 12, 18, 30 GB."
65281,"Updating now, thank you"
65282,"The chart is updated! Added US Mobile's new plans and included the total cost estimate with all taxes & fees included. Please note this is based on what I'm seeing in Colorado, and it may vary by region."
65283,Att prepaid doesn‚Äôt support esim why does it say that I asked att they don‚Äôt have it
65284,You have to sign up on a sim but then after you get the QR card you can use the self service option on paygonline under my device> update device and input the iccid and then scan the QR code. Alternatively you can have care use the imei and the eid. /u/stetsdogg for the next time someone says it won't work.
65285,When will they let u do it other ways than the current way I just don‚Äôt want my dad seeing I signed up fir att prepaid for certain reasons
65286,Uhh I'm not sure I understand care to clarify?
65287,I want to do it without any having it shipped to my house for my dad to find out why it was given to us I like to do it secretly like call up att care team or a store rep
65288,Just order service online for instore pick up then ask for the QR code while you're there.
65289,Yeah but they said they couldn‚Äôt give it to me when I went into store but if I ordered online a physical SIM card from my local store u think they will give me the QR code
65290,Have it sent to a friend's address? Get a p.o. Box?
65291,"I switched my prepaid Acct to esim by going into a B&M store.  The rep was able to do the swap, I think it cost $6."
65292,"My understanding is that it *is possible* to get AT&T Prepaid activated on eSIM. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/a58fnv/att_prepaid_and_esim/) from 2 years ago details the steps (or more accurately someone else does in the comments), and I believe it is still possible to this day."
65293,AT&T Business $10 a month for business qualified customers. Unlimited Talk Text and 3GB of data. No contract. Just need to port number from postpaid carrier and bring your own device.
65294,"u/stetsdogg, can you go through and check that TRUE and FALSE are all caps or all lowercase? When I try and do some filtering, they are being treated as different, and can't seem to select multiple TRUE or FALSE. I could be wrong, but this is my first time experiencing Airtable."
65295,"Hey there, sorry about that. I'll work on getting that fixed today and let you know when it's good to go."
65296,"Thanks. Looks like you may have made them all lower case already, but upper case is still showing as an option. I could be wrong. I filter the upper case and nothing shows, but maybe I already filtered them out for some reason.

May have forgotten to say earlier: THANK YOU!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!"
65297,"Okay! Thank you for your patience! The chart is now updated! There should now only be two True/False values in each of the true/false columns, all now lowercase. 

Please let me know if you have any other issues or I can help out in any other way."
65298,This is helpful. One tiny suggestion: could you put all data caps in the same format? So 500MB as 0.5GB? It would make sorting cleaner.
65299,There is a hidden field called ‚ÄúData Amount Filter‚Äù that has exactly what you are looking for! All data is in GB and displayed as 1 or 0.5 or 0.2.
65300,"Thanks! Made it easy to narrow down my options by requirements like international calling and unlimited data. Ended up going with Google Fi despite it not being on the recommended list - any reason, in particular, it isn't recommended?"
65301,"I personally feel Google Fi isn't worth it. When it launched it was unique in that it could simultaneously switch between the Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular networks for coverage. 

However, after the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, that coverage advantage disappeared. Fi essentially became another T-Mobile MVNO, and when you look at the T-Mobile MVNO landscape... Fi is expensive. 

$20 on Google Fi only gets you unlimited talk and text. No data. That same $20 can get you unlimited talk and text with 10GB of data from Mint Mobile or 12GB of data from US Mobile. Heck, even T-Mobile's own Connect plan offers 2.5GB for just $15.

Even Fi's unlimited plan feels overpriced. $70 for 22GB before capped speeds at 128Kbps. Mint offers 35GB for just $30, literally under half the price of Fi and with more data.

The Google Fi subreddit has also turned into a support forum with tales of customer woes. Sure, it very well could be a vocal minority that is populating the subreddit, and by all means I'm willing to bet a majority of Fi users are satisfied with the service, but seeing the consistent horror stories of poor customer service, not receiving devices, being without service, closed accounts, and more leads me to believe Fi's customer care isn't what it used to be.

The one feature Fi *does* have going for it is the superb international data roaming. I mean seriously, that feature is awesome. Seamless international data roaming at the same rates as domestic data use? Yes, please.

That said, eSIM international plans are becoming more and more popular, and more and more affordable. Traveling to Spain for Mobile World Congress? Grab a 10GB eSIM plan for 15 bucks from US Mobile, or a 1GB eSIM plan from Airalo for $4.50.

Fi can still be great for some people. However, I feel there are better options out there. You can get more data at cheaper prices from Mint Mobile, US Mobile, and other MVNOs, and I feel international eSIM add-ons are an excellent, affordable alternative for international data use.

So that's why Google Fi isn't in my personal recommended plans list."
65302,"Totally agree. I just ditched Googel Fi (after a few months) because even when I was on wifi at home, I was randomly getting charged for mobile data. 

Both Google support and an escalation supervisor said it does happen ""sometimes"". They had no recommendation other than manually disabling mobile data when at home or joined to other wifi and than re-enable when not."
65303,Anyone know if Puretalk has an auto pay discount?
65304,"This is awesome! Thanks, u/stetsdogg!

I'm looking for the cheapest eSIM phone plans for expats that just allows me to have a phone number presence in the USA for the cheapest yearly cost and lowest suffering (i.e. not having to refresh every week or so). 

How do you recommend I best filter for those?"
65305,"I would suggest filtering by price. There is a field called ""cost"" that will let you do this. Off of the top of my head, you may also consider [Red Pocket's $5 annual plan](https://www.bestphoneplans.net/plans/red-pocket-500mb-annual) (you are required to send a message or make a call like once per month just so it stays active though), or you may consider getting a Google Voice number with a US phone number (if that's an option for you)."
65306,"Thanks, u/stetsdogg! Very helpful.

I'll look into Red Pocket's $5, and if eSIM is an option, then sending a message or a call is super easy!

RE: Google Voice, that's what I'm trying to solve. I dropped Verizon when I moved out of the US full-time, but now that I've upgraded my iPhone, I'm locked out of Google Voice because I need to re-verify the number (web still works)."
65307,What's the best pay as you go plan either on AT&T or Verizon? This will be a backup line and won't be used unless required (only need data if that matters)
65308,"Great work on this. FYI, I was looking at Red Pocket's family plan, and it looks like it is now offered on all 4 networks according to https://www.redpocket.com/plans/family, while your table only shows Sprint and AT&T if I'm not mistaken."
65309,TY OP!
65310,"Stetson all I can say is WOW! This is awesome.

I decided to try US Mobile 5GB @$19.91 per month for 5 GB data with unlimited talk and text. Unless throttling becomes an issue (VZ infrastructure is in abundance all around me) this seems like a halfway decent ""set it and forget it"" minimal effort deal.

What u/mrpickem1 wired up on the AT&T Prepaid 8GB Annual is awesome and I may consider that if I need more than 5GB or performance is problematic. Also note: Best Buy currently offers a 10% store credit/discount on prepaid cards."
65311,"Thank you so much for this! I was feeling hopeless and overwhelmed, trying to figure out my cell phone options. And then I found this! You are an artist, Stetson."
65312,I didn't see verizon's visible plan

65324,"How come when I click ""unlimited plans"" it's showing me plans that aren't unlimited data?

Edit: This is tedious to navigate on a phone, but I'm giving it a good 'ol American try. I'm looking for a plan that is unlimited data, but also allowed for 1080p video streaming. My current Sprint plan is unlimited with 1080p, but I pay an amount so high I'm assumed to admit it. I'll say this. I could make a car payment for the amount I'm paying for two lines. I'm a truck driver, so that 1080p unlimited is really crucial. It slows down after 35gb, but I hardly ever hit that cap. And even when I do, I can still watch 1080p videos most of the time"
65325,"So, I'm about to buy a phone this black Friday, and would really like to get out of a contract when I barely use all the services.
Uh any suggestions?"
65326,Quick sanity check - I switched to Red Pocket(AT&T) from my Verizon plan. I bought the sim card and the monthly plan from the Red Pocket site. I now want to buy the annual plan from eBay. Will I have issues adding the 12 month plan to my existing account at Red Pocket? Please and thank you.

65328,"Coverage maps are always generous. 

Ask friends, neighbors and coworkers. Or if you‚Äôre willing to spend a little money to research, get a prepaid SIM."
65329,Also coverage maps don‚Äôt reflect speed or quality of service. It just means you should get a signal there. Now if it‚Äôs a usable signal or not is a different story.
65330,"I agree. Get a prepaid Verizon sim, also try T-Mobile test drive, they‚Äôve improved coverage lately. What city and state are you located ?"
65331,"And yeah, coverage maps suck. They all lie."
65332,They really do. I worked for t mobile and it was awful.
65333,"Coverage maps are semi accurate, I use websites that show locations of towers and how many towers"
65334,Can you site one please?

65336,"So within the past 2 years I have had Verizon (currently), T-Mobile and AT&T. I would rank Verizon ahead of AT&T but nothing major. T-Mobile had patches where I would lose service and I rarely had the same with AT&T and Verizon. I‚Äôm sure both would serve you well especially if you live within the city.  I live in Plano and travel to Dallas for work and I have 5G almost the entire way but for sure LTE the whole with Verizon."
65337,At&t owns both blocks of band 5 in Dallas( and most of Texas ) so Verion has to use either band 2 or band 66 for Nationwide 5G
65338,I‚Äôll be honest... I have no idea what that means lol.
65339,band 5 is what Verion uses for low band 5G also known as Nationwide 5G in most of the US. Verion doesn't have any band 5 in most of Texas so they have to use bands 2 or 66. Both bands are higher frequency which mean they don't travel as far or penetrate buildings as well. So at least inside one can expect worse 5G performance in these are vs areas that use band 5.
65340,"Thank you, this explains why I have poor service inside many buildings.  Cedar Park, Texas"
65341,Verizon's only low band there is band 13 which is 4G. So you'd need to turn off 5G
65342,I never switched to 5g
65343,then you should be getting band 13 inside just fine then
65344,"For text and calls, yes.    To look on Reddit or web, I can burn my battery waiting for stuff to download.   And it‚Äôs the same with different brand phones."
65345,"interesting. where i'm at verizon owns band 5, but whenever i get nationwide 5g its either on 2 or 66. are there particular NR bands that correspond to band 2, 5, and 66, respectively?

I try to research this stuff, but hard to find good sources."
65346,"n2, n5 and n66 are the 5G bands. 5G needs an LTE band to piggy back on so that's probably why you are seeing bands 2 or 66."
65347,I think I understand how DSS works. Just wondering about some of the specifics. Namely why band 5 status is always shown as lte for me and if band 5 corresponds to a specific nr band (thinking maybe it's because my phone doesn't have that nr band).
65348,"Well 5G needing a LTE piggyback has nothing to do with DSS. DSS is where 4G and 5G share the same spectrum. What are you using to see what band you are using? Also what devices are you using. As I told you n5 is the 5G band of LTE band 5. And I doubt you have a 5G phone that doesn't have n5 but has other sub 6 GHz bands

LTE band 2= n2 for 5G

LTE band 5= n5 for 5G

LTE band 4= n66 for 5G

LTE band 66= n66 for 5G

n13 doesn't exist yet but will in about 18 months"
65349,">What are you using to see what band you are using? 

LTE Discovery to see the bands (they've added 5g recently), 
network signal guru and QCT Modem Capabilities to force bands.

>Also what devices are you using. 
I have a pixel 4a 5g (unlocked, so without the mmWave radio).

So I can force band 5 LTE easily here, but it doesn't switch over to 5g. Every time it switches to 5g, it's either on band 66 or band 2. I'm confident that I'm on those bands because I'm forcing those bands and double checking with the discovery app, that I am indeed on those apps. Once I establish the LTE discovery app works consistently, I stop forcing any bands and I can see how it automatically switches to B2 and B66 to get to 5g."
65350,">LTE Discovery to see the bands (they've added 5g recently), network signal guru and QCT Modem Capabilities to force bands.

Still might not be working properly

>I stop forcing any bands and I can see how it automatically switches to B2 and B66 to get to 5g.

B2 and B66 is 4G. If they were 5G they would be n2 and n66 also they both couldn't be 5G at the same time as the only devices that can do carrier aggregation within 5G bands are the new S21 models

Also does the unlocked Pixel 4a 5G have the software update to enable Nationwide 5G yet?"

65352,"I live in Frisco and found the same thing. We had been on Verizon a few years ago and it was fine. Then we switched to TMo a couple years ago when I started with a new company and got a good deal on TMo service and they basically paid off our two iPhone X to switch. Service was okay but for me more inconsistent than Verizon.

We just switched back to Verizon in October when they were giving $550 per iPhone X trade value and a $250 gift card for each line we brought in.

For me, I feel like the service is back to being more consistent than TMo. My wife says for the places she is most often (work, gym, etc) that Verizon is worse than TMo.

I think basically they‚Äôre all going to be generally pretty similar in larger metro areas - overall solid, but with certain areas that are better on one carrier than the other.

My parents are still on TMo in the Dallas area and said that it‚Äôs great for them. I have lots of friends on ATT in the Dallas area who say that overall it‚Äôs good. 

Next time I‚Äôm considering switching, or just want to see if a service is better I‚Äôll get a prepaid SIM for ATT and TMo and put them through their paces before making a decision.

But overall, I‚Äôm pleased with Verizon, but as with any of this, location can make a big difference."
65353,"When I lived in North Garland (near Richardson and the toll road) my Verizon was so bad I was able to get out of my contract for free. Everyone and their brother has ‚Äúma‚Äô bell‚Äù aka AT&T because it felt almost impossible to drop call. I loved my AT&T service and speed (hated customer service)

Verizon is better now than ten years ago when I left them but if you don‚Äôt have AT&T in the metroplex you‚Äôre either loyal or trying to save money."
65354,"I'm new to the metroplex and only been to a few cities with my Verizon phone; kept VZ when I left Florida 

Most people I know have AT&T phones here.

Verizon has been good for me at home and work (Lewisville). I haven't had any issues in the cities in the metro. Went out to a small town in Denton County and I was less than impressed with the data (probably band13 only). Service was very kooky in southern Oklahoma too. Rural northeast Texas seemed ok for me as well.

Friend's AT&T drops in the oddest of places in the metroplex (near DFW Airport, for one), but AT&T seems solid from what I've seen."
65355,"Unfortunately no one can answer that question except for you. There are way to many variables involved for anyone to give you a good answer.  
When evaluating coverage don‚Äôt take anyone word for it test it out yourself. Especially in dense cities. Speeds can vary greatly from block to block and even what side of a building you are on can make a big difference. At my office building I can get 3.5 Gbps on mmWave in exterior wall rooms with windows that face a mmWave tower, on nationwide 5G I‚Äôm usually around 100 Mbps, on LTE I‚Äôm usually around 130 or higher. Now a block away there is one area that I‚Äôm lucky to hit 1 Mbps on LTE and nationwide 5G I‚Äôm getting 5Mbps or so.

To determine what carrier is the best for you,  you have to take a few things in consideration. 

1. How do you use your phone? Do you just talk and text on it,  or do basic web browsing and video streaming, or are you a heavy data/hotspot user. 

2. Can you test out other carriers in multiple areas for speed, keeping in mind with how you use your phone. If you just talk and text then as long as you have signal bars on your phone you should be fine with any carrier (also I would add that if you only talk and text consider a MVNO as they are much cheaper). If you just do basic browsing and streaming then I would probably make sure you have at least 5-10 Mbps or so speed in the places you test. If you are a heavy data user shoot for a higher number than that. Also don‚Äôt forget to look at upload speeds as well not just downloads.  Don‚Äôt just test at home, test areas where you work, travel through, and hang out in as well. 

3. Lastly look at plan costs. See which carrier has the best plans that meets your needs. 

4. If you can get a prepaid sim and try the service for yourself. Just be mindful of you are switching carriers to save money (let‚Äôs say one carrier is 5 bucks a month cheaper, over a year that 60 bucks. But you paid 50 bucks or so for the prepaid sim and a month of service for testing so you really might not save much in the long run). 

Also don‚Äôt be afraid to try a carrier that you may have had bad experience with in the past. Coverage is always changing and expanding on all carriers. Also it is possible that coverage can get worse in areas. I know in my area one spot coverage got a little worse a year ago when Verizon moved their tower to another spot about 1/2 mile away because lease prices were getting to high so it was cheaper to move their equipment to another tower. 

I switched and stayed with Verizon cause it‚Äôs the most consistent. Although it‚Äôs not always the fastest speed  I always have coverage so I stick with them. 

Just do some testing and see what works best for you. Best of luck."
65356,"I had Sprint for 10+ years. When we would go on vacation (California, Massachusetts, Florida, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Texas) with family who had Verizon. 98% of the time they either had better service than me. Of course that‚Äôs just anecdotal and of course Sprint VS Verizon."
65357,"It's because you had Sprint. Out of urban areas their network is highly fragmented. They pick certain routes and just stop, sometimes will skip sites and leave a huge gap. No service on I-80 from east of Fernley, NV to Utah, about 340 miles or 5hrs @75 mph. For the most part their network engineers suck. My only complaints of Verizon are network congestion and customer service."
65358,I‚Äôm a Verizon employee and I believed the hype and switched from simple to Verizon and service was terrible! I had to switch back lol. It really depends on where you live though
65359,location?
65360,I live near Eglin AFB in Florida
65361,Cool. I've been near there a few times. My grandmother used to live in Crestview. Anyway you'd think all the carriers would have areas around the base covered pretty well.
65362,Att works better in Florida
65363,"I wouldn‚Äôt say so at all. In Naples, FL it is abundantly clear that Verizon is the winner and the vast majority of people I know have switched to Verizon or already had it."
65364,East and central Florida att is better though
65365,Northwest Florida
65366,That can be anywhere from Pensacola to Tallahassee. But it seems at&t overall has more spectrum there
65367,In Pace / Milton ‚Äî lived in ATL and LA prior and TMobile was awesome.  However I‚Äôd lose services for 5-10miles on I10 between Biloxi - Mobile - Pensacola so I went back to Verizon.  It‚Äôs more reliable but I‚Äôm underwhelmed by this areas service in general.   Even our FTTH in two locations underperforms.
65368,"With Verizon you might have poor reception inside of buildings, I know I do."
65369,"Agree with trial run suggestions in previous comments. Tends to be the most sure-fire way to know what another carrier would be like where you are. Prepaid SIMs give an idea of cell coverage (though may not reflect postpaid data speeds in all markets, congestion and buildout depending).

If you haven't already, you may also be able to glean some interesting perspective in your area using Rootmetrics, Open Signal, and Cellmapper."
65370,If you go with VZW I'd suggest getting a non-5G phone for the time being.
65371,Really depends on where you are living and if you travel a lot. There is a reason Verizon has the most customers though. I have had every carrier here in Texas and Verizon is the best closely followed by att. Tmobile is very spotty and building penetration by t-mobile is very bad. Really you need to ask co workers and friends. I bet most will say verizon.
65372,"If you travel, yes. If you will just be in a general area, ask friends or family."
65373,"It depends on your location /population density , Verizon works best in most areas on postpaid plans , in some areas it‚Äôs congested but vzw has a dense grid so they‚Äôre still the best in suburbs and rural areas"
65374,Main thing is -- do you have an issue with AT&T? If not I wouldn't swap. If so Verizon may be worth a try.
65375,Where I live it does. Not even close. I've had all of the big 3. ATT is pretty good but has worse reception or no reception where Verizon will have 3 or 4 bars. T-mobile is a joke here.
65376,"I‚Äôve been with Verizon since like 2007. I have no issues, Midwest MN. My cousin has T-Mobile and it‚Äôs horrible here. 1-2 bars most times."
65377,"I was with Verizon for a long time and they had great coverage and never had any issues. I recently switched(Bill was too high) to Google Fi and find the coverage on the same level as Verizon. So it depends on your area and needs. I would say try them out if you can, before you switch fully."
65378,Verizon used to be great but I feel like they haven‚Äôt been able to keep up lately. With that said.... Asking people on here is not the best because Verizon works different depending the area you are in. So it would be better to ask your neighbors and coworkers. Even then it could vary.
65379,"I switched to Verizon from AT&T and regret it. I‚Äôll probably be going back. I drop calls and data is iffy. I‚Äôve never dropped a call with AT&T, ever."
65380,I switched to Verizon postpaid from AT&T Prepaid. Deprioritization was pretty severe (sometimes couldn't even send an iMessage) but customer service was quite good. Ended up switching to AT&T postpaid (Unlimited Elite) and it's been very solid.
65381,"The research does not matter, all that matters is what works where you spend the time the most. I have all 3 carriers and they mostly all use the same towers. In some locations Verizon is terrible even with great signal. For instance, at home I get 0.5up/and down on Verizon , 40/2 on AT&T, and 20/6 on T-mobile. Verizon has the best signal strength, but their equipment is massively overloaded. They probably have T-1's instead of fiber. 

A few miles down the road they switch rank and all are in the 100/20 area.

Ultimately in comes down to what gives you the most bang for your buck, but the carriers are all pretty good."
65382,With any carrier it depends on where you live.
65384,What‚Äôs your city/state?
65385,Niceville Florida
65386,"That area is very well covered by all 3 carriers (TM/AT/VZ). The trouble is that there will always be pockets where coverage is poor; or just the tower near you whose antennas are poorly aligned or overloaded at specific times. There is no way for anyone to know which carrier will work all the time. If you are really suffering, you might want to try T-Mobile first. Verizon has a wide network but they are not the fastest and they depri a lot more."
65387,T-Mobile could be the only carrier with reception in my area and I would struggle to recommend them. Their numerous outages throughout my career there of 10+ years were embarrassing. I get that all carriers can have outages but I had Verizon most of my time working there because tmobile always would go out.
65388,Verizon is the only one that works in my house as well as my basement with data and voice. And I live in a rural area. So I shut my WiFi off and have no issues. Also I get 5g at my home.
65389,"Try before you buy. I barely got anything with Verizon, but AT&T got 2 bars. T-Mobile recently got better here as well."
65390,"I honestly have nothing bad to say about Verizon.  They are a pretty solid company,  and,  outside of my time in Alaska,  I got really good reception on their service.  I've had them,  off and on,  for more than 10 years. They provide extremely good customer service.

I even had their service for the 2 years that I had Xfinity mobile, with great service then as well. 

I take issue with the price of service,  but, when you're living in the US, you pay way more than you should for that privilege anyway..."
65391,What kind of phone do you have now?
65392,"Depends where you're at and your phone. If you're traveling domestically too, you can't go wrong with VZW...they keep adding macro sites in suburban and rural areas too. 5G NSA hasn't made much difference for everyone, so like as stated above, try prepaid."
65393,"It‚Äôs all about location. I love that I can bundle with FiOS and I guess you‚Äôll have coverage everywhere, even if it‚Äôs 1 bar.

My old address in NJ, AT&T was better than Verizon and it‚Äôs opposite for others, it‚Äôs all about your hood.

One thing about Verizon is that it‚Äôs king in NYC, their hometown, the only carrier to work in tunnels. So yea if you are in a city, your money may be with Verizon"
65395,"They have good coverage. However, if you dont have either the ""Play more"", ""Do more"", or ""Get More"" unlimited plan, they will put your device under whats called network management. What it actually is that you are be deprioritized and throttled throughout the day. So if you are having issues with data, make sure you aren't on the ""Start Unlimited"" plan. 

Also, if you have wi-fi in your home, make sure that wi-fi calling is turned on. It' s a free feature from VZW"
65396,"I have had multiple different phone plans and for me Verizon blows them out of the park. I live in an area where good WiFi is impossible so it‚Äôs always good to have a service provider that provides super fast, unlimited data. Honestly the only downside I have with Verizon is that sometimes the data will randomly stop working for a couple of hours (usually at night) and that Can be very annoying especially if you‚Äôre like me and you don‚Äôt have very good WiFi at you‚Äôre house. It doesnt happen too often but it‚Äôs enough to be an issue."
65397,I have that issue to with data randomly stop working.
65398,"Im in Queens/NYC most of the time 
I had att then Tmobile as of last 
Recently ive changed it to Verizon 
What a difference 
To answer your question 
Yea! 
Go for it
You‚Äôll never look back

65400,Alternate question: which is the best STD to get?
65401,Alternate Alternate Question: Which is the best way to get murdered?
65402,Alternate Alternate Alternate Question: Which bear is best?
65403,Well that‚Äôs debatable. There are two schools of thought.
65404,Fact: bears eat beats
65405,"Uhm, idk, I don't need STD for my everyday life."
65406,"true, but if you did how would you decide which one was best when they are all awful?"
65407,"Choose bacterial std‚Äôs, they can be cured. Chlamydia or gonorrhea or a random uti or something. Even though, there‚Äôs like an antibiotic resistant gonorrhea now I believe-so chlamydia?"
65408,"but wouldn't not having any of them be better because they all suck?
The cell carriers are the same, they all suck, they all lie, they all over charge & under deliver."
65409,"So, I did a cross country road trip a few years back, NYC area to San Diego. I unfortunately had T-Mobile at the time. I got royally screwed over by them. At the time, I don't remember the details, but they messed something up that made it out to be that my account wasn't paid. They turned off my cell phone while I was in the middle of nowhere and unable to make a call. To make it even better, their billing department isn't 24/7 so I wasn't even able to rectify the situation. Ironically, I was the only person out of the group that I was with that had service at that one particular spot. Fortunately, we were at a rest area when we needed to get our car towed and were able to go inside and use theirs, but that made me particularly salty. I say mine worked ironically because there was a several day stretch where I didn't have any service when everyone I was with did. Verizon had service pretty much for the duration and ATT was in at a close second. After that whole debacle I switched to Verizon as soon as I got home and haven't really looked back since. I had a short time when I was on Project Fi but had similar problems as I did with T-Mo and would up getting on my fiance's Verizon plan. I would vote that Verizon is the ""best"" carrier, but it certainly comes at a cost."
65410,The whole Sprint is half the price and only 1% less coverage thing makes a huge difference. Do you know how many times I‚Äôm in a place where Sprint users are trying to get a signal and I‚Äôm already 10 steps ahead with Verizon? It‚Äôs worth the price.
65411,"Do you mean the 1% makes a huge difference? It seems to be that at least in my area, my former roommate had Sprint and it would regularly be the case that I had service and she didn't."
65412,I had a friend tell me that he couldn't get reception in the middle of a city with Sprint.
65413,"As far as quality goes, probably Verizon. But also, pretty much any telecomm in the USA is overpriced shit."
65414,I get unlimited for 20-25 so I‚Äôm happy (Verizon)
65415,"As for as service quality, Verizon. Bang for your buck, T-Mobile. In between the two I‚Äôd say is ATT. It‚Äôs nearly as good as Verizon service, nearly as affordable T-Mobile. Sprint is the cheapest of the four, but their service is crap imo. 
Then they‚Äôre a bunch of smaller ones like metro pcs, etc, that I don‚Äôt really know about."
65417,"[Teltik](http://teltik.com/),  a T-Mobile business line reseller, is always consistently left out of these types of lists, in favor of more expensive, and less competitive offerings. You have to have an EIN or a screenshot of an Ebay/Shopify storefront/other proof of having a business to qualify, but once you do, it is an excellent service.

Unlimited talk, text, data, for $40/mo (plus $3.5 taxes and fees) makes it an excellent choice. Plus it's postpaid priority, you still get T-mobile Tuesdays, and excellent support. IMHO, it should have been mentioned in both ""Best Premium Unlimited Data Plans"" and potentially the ""Best Value Unlimited Data Plans"" categories as well."
65418,Agreed! I have been loving my $30 6GB Teltik plan!
65419,"This is not bad, but the EIN/business requirement doesn't make it a valid option for tourists or those who aren't US residents.

65420,"I signed up with them a few months ago, switched from Sprint after my free years were done. Been really happy with the speed and coverage, I listed one thing on eBay and took a screenshot and that was enough for the business verification."
65421,"Teltik is an excellent option. I chose to exclude them from the video because they are more for businesses. Not everyone will have a business ID, and as someone else mentioned they aren't an option for non-US residents. I felt Ultra Mobile's $40 unlimited plan was a good alternative, so I mentioned them. 

But you're absolutely right, Teltik is a great option, especially with their higher data priority. They probably deserved a shoutout at the very least. I'll be sure to mention them in my dedicated ""best unlimited plans"" video."

The ""25GB"" (8GB+17GB bonus) Walmart plan isn't listed either, but is also the 8GB plan with some modifications.

The $25 one listed without data is a separate plan."
65432,Mint Mobile 12GB plan is only $25 for the first 3 months. An introductory rate. It then jumps up to $45. Right?
65433,"It depends on how you choose to renew your plan. The 12GB plan is $25/mo for the first 3 months as an introductory offer for new customers. When you go to renew your plan, you have 3 options:

1. Renew for 3 months at $45/mo
2. Renew for 6 months at $35/mo
3. Renew for 12 months at $25/mo

It's possible to continue getting the 12GB/$25 price, so I keep it listed that way in the comparison chart. Similarly, all plans are listed with their auto-pay discounts applied."
65434,"If Mint Mobile is working well for 3-months, most customers will opt to continue on and lock in the $25/month pricing."
65435,"How many are willing to prepare a year though? It doesn't seem like many are willing to drop $200 or $300 at once for a year of service.

Teltik seems to be mentioned a bit, but if you know TMobile network works for you, save some money and get more data through a 1yr plan. Seems like if it were the case Red pocket would be even more popular with the crazy deals they have."
65436,Great work! Thank you for this service!
65437,Isn't the freeup Mobile free plan gone?
65438,"Yes! Great call, thank you. Updated the chart."
65439,"I'm still on Boost Mobile 5GB $30 plan.  It was $35 for 2GB, but once you made a certain number of on-time payments, they would increase it 0.5GB to a max of 3GB, so a total of 5GB.  Plus the auto-pay $5 discount, $30 is paid

Great to see this info, much appreciated"
65440,"Nice, that almost sounds like what T-Mobile was proposing for a prepaid plan if the merger goes through‚Ä¶ 2GB and 5GB and they increase 500MB every year for up to 4 years (I think) is what the wording was."
65441,"Just wanted to make sure you know metro 4 unlimited lines for $100 plan still exists with port in from non TMobile network carrier. 

https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/4-for-100

You can also do 5 for $125."
65442,"This is a great option, I'll be sure to mention it in my family plan video."
65443,No hotspot or hd video
65444,"Just note, no tethering and video limited to 480p."
65445,Visible should be changed to $25 but also have Party Pay mentioned. But nice job!
65446,"Will definitely include this in the family plan comparison chart, seems more appropriate to list it as a group discount."
65447,How did cricket not make this list one time? lol
65448,"I mentioned Cricket in the video! While I haven‚Äôt tried Pure TalkUSA myself, their new prices are lower than Cricket‚Äôs for 5GB ($30 vs $35). Since I could only chose one plan for the video, I went with Pure TalkUSA‚Äôs cheaper plan. 

Cricket is still great, and perhaps deserves the recommendation if Pure TalkUSA‚Äôs experience is poor, but I thought it would be better to give Pure TalkUSA the nod for this one and focus on Cricket for my best family plans video and my dedicated 5GB video."
65449,"why not Cricket's BYOD Unlimited for $40? 

https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans/40-unlimited-BYOD-plan"
65450,Give the man some time to update the chart.  I'm sure he's getting all kinds of suggestions on stuff to add.
65451,"A YouTube commenter pointed this out too! I honestly forgot about the plan while making the video. I may have also been hesitant to add it if it was a more limited-time promo. 

For now it is still sticking around, and I should have mentioned it! I'll definitely be sure to mention it in my dedicated ""best unlimited plans"" video.

You can find the plan in the comparison chart üëçüèª"
65452,"I am going to ditch my PureTalkUSA service as my data stopped working and customer support could not figure out why as in their system i am subscribed. If i use my wife's sim  which is under same family plan data works just fine on my phone, so definitely they have screwed up my account and literally provide no fix instead just giving me run around by forwarding me to a phone number which no one ever picks up. Looking at Consumer Cellular and Cricket now as a possible move."
65453,Would be nice if there was a category for family/miltiline plans
65454,"I don't believe that Red Pocket (at least the AT&T variant) actually includes hotspot.

I got excited when I saw that on your website.  But when I tried enabling it on my Pixel, I got an error message saying I needed to contact AT&T to enable hotspot functionality."
65455,"Have you tried contacting Red Pocket support about enabling hotspot? This [Howard Forum post](https://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1912780) from March, 2019 seems to indicate hotspot should be supported for Android devices on the AT&T network.

I've been meaning to test Red Pocket too, so this is something I'll look into when I try them out."
65456,"Ah, I hadn't.  I messed around with MVNO options in the APN setting as mentioned in that thread, but no luck.  Guess I have to contact Red Pocket to get them to activate if I want it."
65457,"One thing I noticed is that I can't filter with 2 carriers.  Like I want to compare verizon & at&t carriers and I can only do one or the other.

edit; never mind, needed to select ""is any of"""
65458,"if only there were a section for top free plan 

:("
65459,"I think it would also be nice to have a chart or tab for deals.  Common deals to look for, when to look for them.   

Also, for the services that are monthly, I'd make additional colomns.  $20/mo for 8GB on Mint is very misleading.  You need to add a ""3-month prepaid"" colomn, ""6-month prepaid"" and ""12-month prepaid"" so that these can be filtered. And this way all the price points are included.  

Not everyone wants to or can do short/long term prepaid."
65460,"Nice list!

Are promotional plans included?  There's that Att prepaid 8GB plan for $25/mo"
65461,"Maybe i missed, but is international roaming considered/listed?"
65462,"Yep! There is a column called ""International Coverage"" which is essentially international roaming."
65463,"You did a great job in chart that have a lot of valuable information. It is understandable that you might be missing information, for that reason I have some recommendations that will improve the list. 

I will consider the redpocket annual plan it will be a big plus for anyone looking to save.

I will agree with other comments that mentioned that Teltik needs to be the top list, and also to add the Visible Party promotion ($25/month)

Also it will be good to have another field that shows if the price is plus taxes or everything included. So that $25 plan can be $30 depending in your local taxes and fees.

Thank you"
65464,"Visible does support wifi calling on iPhones and some Androids. Unfortunately, not Pixels at the moment."
65465,Fantastic job.  Something I always wonder with MVNO pricing is if the taxes and fees are built into the advertised rate or if they are tacked on later.  It would be AMAZING if this could be added to your chart.
65466,I know for a fact that they are on visible
65468,"Yep, those are on the comparison chart. Also great options."
65469,"I thought that us mobile now disallows mobile hotspot (Phone and/or Dedicated Device) as per TOS. 

If turned on will not gain access to the internet thru another device."
65470,Prepaidcompare.net already does this.
65471,"Super helpful, thank you! Just discovering all these other MNVOs after leaving Verizon. Right now on Mint Mobiles trial, but might want to check out cheaper plan. But looks like Ultra Mobile no longer has $11 plan. Can you confirm or update the table?"
65472,"US Mobile doesn't support eSIM. I just chatted with them, and they said they're ""working on it""."
65473,"Why are altice and hellomobile left out? Altice isn't on your airtable list, hellomobile is there but isn't in your best plans summary"
65474,Why US mobile is not in best data list despite having 50GB premium data for $40
65475,"I have a question, What would be the best option to go for if I was trying to have 2 lines, and bundle it with internet only."
65476,Do you mean bundling it from an ISP?
65477,"Verizon's Get More Unlimited plan is currently $100/mo + fees/tax. They currently have a promo for $250 gift card if you can BYOD, pretty nice"
65478,The $90 price is the plan listed with the $10 auto-pay discount applied. I chose to list all plans with their auto-pay discounts because they are easy enough to get. I would LOVE to find a way to factor in the taxes though to get the true cost of the plan.
65479,"Ahhh gotcha, some providers factor in that auto-pay discount on their displayed price and some don't on their own websites (T-Mobile lists the price with auto-pay applied, while Verizon doesn't).

Thanks for the post it's been super useful as I am switching plans sometime soon, I appreciate that work you put in on this!"
65480,"So I'm on visible currently, could I port to Verizon for a month to get this deal then move back to visible after?"
65481,I've been total wireless for a couple years and coming from Verizon I honestly can't tell they are two separate carriers. That's because they run off Verizon's towers which means awesome coverage and almost always have decent service (according to how many bars I get) I use the 5gb for 35/mo since it's only $10 more to get 5gb more. Usually don't ever go past that and I'm a fairly heavy data user. I think it's a great value for almost the same service you'd get for paying the big bucks with Verizon.
65482,"I have been on the sprint BYOD for $5 with autopay and $15 insurance (somehow still under $20 on my bill) but the promo is over in a few days so am looking for a new plan. Really I have had good experience with Sprint but in my home it can be a bit shady with only 1-2 bars. 

Anyone have any tips for what to use in Maui? 

I was thinking of switching to Verizon or T Mobile (as i hear good things about them here). 

I will be spending a lot of time in West Maui and Hana.

&#x200B;

Thanks :)"
65483,Anyone know how I can filter this by ESIM?
65484,"You might be missing a newer AT&T MVNO:  Good2Go Mobile.

 [https://www.good2gomobile.com/plans](https://www.good2gomobile.com/plans)"
65485,Thanks for this. They have added Hotspot access to the Total Wireless plans. 10gb I believe.
65486,"tracfone 

90 day $19.99 plan [no data] works out to $22.01 with the fees, or about $7.34/month

If you buy this plan on the tracfone website you can add in an extra 365 days for ~ $50 more = $75.00 with fees for 15 months, about $5/month

I use this for SMS 2-factor verifications and a ""dump"" number for corporations. The phone is forwarded to my Voip provider so I don't use Tracfone's voicemail or Tracfone's minutes, usually. I can always make phone calls out if needed, if perhaps I can't reach my Voip provider. It also solves my 9-1-1 problem if I'm mobile.  

There is a very limited amount of minutes, but since minutes roll over with active service I have over a thousand at this point. Reading an SMS costs 1/3 of a minute."
65487,"TextNow has introduced Free unlimited text&call on cellular. No data, but it's very useful because it precludes having to be on WiFi or installing VoIP client on another device."
65488,Tello unlimited data/unlimited mins free text is $39 a month. I wonder if there any deals out there that can trump this? Right now I'm paying $19 for the 4GB data/unlimited mins free text plan because I have wifi at home/work and haven't gone over 2GB of data in almost a year.
65489,What about cricket???
65490,"What would folks suggest for a 2 line plan that features fairly heavy data usage, minor international travel, and a fairly flexible budget? My wife and I are considering moving to our own plan off the family plan due to the limitations the family plan puts us on.

Possible considerations for a mobile hotspot also in times of need."
65491,Is Sprint's kickstart plan a temporary one??
65492,Sheppard - Carrier pigeons

65494,"USAFE: stay the hell away from Vodafone.

O2, or Three(3) is best for heavy data plans."
65495,"Made the mistake of stopping at the ""Digital Phone Company"" kiosk in the Lakenheath BX right when I got here. They can *only* get you set up with Vodafone. Just wait till you can get to Bury to visit the O2 or Three store. 

EDIT: Just switched from Vodafone to Three. Was paying 39 pounds per month  and am now paying 12.90 per month. That's 200 minutes, 5000 texts, and unlimited data. (That's if you own your phone, which I do). 

For those using ctl+f: raf lakenheath feltwell mildenhall."
65496,"And stay away from t-Mobil. Too many random payments on bills! 45‚Ç¨ for ""connection fees"" last month!"
65497,Kadena- either Docomo or AU.  SoftBank sucks.
65498,"SoftBank is the worst. It's expensive, and the reception is the worst on the island.  If you get an iPhone with them, it is locked for life too. Fuck them."
65499,"Ain't that the truth. But when I showed up was when SoftBank, and only SoftBank had the iPhone so everyone was going there. I didn't know any better and it was where my sponsor took me. 

When I went back stateside I kept forgetting I didn't need to go outside to use my phone- it was strange."
65500,I'm at Misawa and I wish I'd gone AU over DoCoMo just for convenience. Our local DoCoMo store has no English speaking reps so anytime I need anything account related I have to pass a phone back and forth. AU has reps in the BX.
65501,Creech - Verizon or AT&T. Any other service provider and you lose reception halfway through your commute.
65502,Offutt is verizon. Nothing else is even close really.
65503,"Yokota- AU or Docomo, Softbank sucks here too."
65504,"I found SoftBank to be excellent in Tokyo, hell, even on the top of Mt Fuji. But when I had to spend a week at Yokota I was always out of service."
65505,"Goodfellow - AT&T or Verizon
Shaw AFB - pretty much anything but I use AT&T and I have 4G everywhere"
65506,I love t-mobile in the conus
65507,For me T-Mobile was pretty bad at Keesler and non-existent at Offutt. Verizon has been great everywhere I've tried it.
65508,"Loved it too, but it sucks in the south and is none existent in Alaska. Shame"
65509,it's been decent at lackland and keesler but I'm sure in more rural areas it's shit
65510,It's crap at LR
65511,Hickam - VZW or AT&T. T-Mobile and Sprint users have significantly less coverage throughout the islands.
65512,"I wouldn't exactly say ""significantly"" with T-Mobile.  I'd say their coverage spread is about 70-75% of AT&T's and Verizon's.  T-Mobile's network is excellent when you have access to it.  Sprint not only has significantly less coverage, but their coverage also only goes up to 3G.  Sprint doesn't have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet."
65513,"Keesler:  AT&T and Verizon will give you the best coverage.  T-Mobile will give you really good speeds if you don't venture west of Gulfport, north of D'Iberville, or east of Ocean Springs.  Sprint is hit or miss even though they just upgraded their network to LTE there last year."
