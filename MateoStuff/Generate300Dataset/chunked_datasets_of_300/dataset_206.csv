68040,"I think most of PKD's books can be described as ahead of their time.  *A Scanner Darkly*, for example, portrays the damage, both physically and mentally, of drug use under a police state.  What with marijuana gaining legalization across the country and police abuse of authority garnering so much attention I'd say that's a much more prescient book for readers in 2015.  At the very least Dick's ability to distort reality and unreality seems more prophetic everyday."
68041,"I'm surprised you include *Starship Troopers* without including *Stranger in a Strang Land*. The library of congress even included it in its list of [Books that Shaped America](http://www.loc.gov/bookfest/books-that-shaped-america/)

I guess you didn't grok it.

Edit: Other good books not on the list: *A Canticle for Lebowitz*, *Fahrenheit 451*, and *1984* (although I guess this one is debatable on being Sci-Fi)"
68042,"It's a strange book.  It starts out fine, and then half-way through it become a whole different book, and a very preachy one at that."
68043,"I'm looking for a copy of Dune with [this cover](http://hodderscape.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dune-cover.jpg) but can't find it for sale anywhere. It apparently released on the 16th July, so I expected it to be the easiest to find. Anyone know where I can buy a copy in the UK? Thanks."
68044,How much are you willing to spend? [The Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/9780340960196) has it for $16.00 (paperback) with free shipping and it's $21.00 (hardback). I'm not sure what those prices are in £.
68045,"I saw it in Waterstones the other day, maybe your local one has a copy?"
68046,"I can't express my admiration enough for Well's ""The War of the Worlds""

It has remained my favorite book since I first read it when I was 9-10 years old.  

There's just so much cool stuff about it.

Wells' criticism of colonial imperialism.

Wells describing the martians as utterly repulsive, and then suggests that's where human evolution is going.

His ability to recognize what happens when societal standards break down.

His take on religion and how it helps/hinders in the direst of times and what a terrible crutch it turns out to be.

The ACTION SEQUENCE of the Thunderchild!

The way Wells describes how the martian machines are graceful, almost animistic in their movements thanks to the ""muscles"" they employed and the concept of the martians not utilizing the wheel.

The narrative is never boring.  And the language.   When Wells uses the phrase ""gaunt quiet"" to describe a soundless London....it's utterly perfect.

Appreciation of the novel is heightened if you have a knowledge of what were the scientific viewpoints of the day and how Wells integrated them into his work.   Especially in regards to evolution.    

Still waiting for someone to do a decent and faithful interpretation of the novel.   I think if done properly, modern audiences could relate to the themes raised in the story.   Hell, how many Jane Austin fans are there around?"
68047,I feel like Octavia Butler's Kindred should be on this list. Just not sure what I'd drop off of it to add it...
68048,"Solid list but I'm really not so sure about Neuromancer. I picked it up and really wanted to like it but I just don't think its a good book. The characters a pretty one-dimensional and the plot is super convoluted. I read the last 25% two times to try to figure it out and still don't think it really makes sense. 

Maybe its worth reading because it defined the genre of cyberpunk but I don't think its a good book otherwise."
68049,John dies at the end is garbage. No. Ray Bradbury or Kurt Vonnegutt? Come on.
68050,Surprised that The Martian didn't make the list.
68051,Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey. My top sci fi pic.
68052,"If you've got *Starship Troopers* and *The Forever War*, you might as well add *Old Man's War*."
68053,"If we only have one John Scalzi book, I would put Old Man's War on there ahead of Redshirts. Redshirts is definitely different, but Old Man's War in Scalzi's defining book thus far."
68054,"I thought in comparison to *Starship Troopers* and *The Forever War, Old Man's War* was very weak.  I read it immediately after *Forever War* and I found the exposition to be extraordinarily clunky in comparison.  All of the characters seem to have the same voice as well.  They all speak with the same lighthearted wit and jokes as well as sharing tone and voice."
68055,"Should have been a list of 16 books, for Larry Niven's Ringworld."
68056,I'm surprised no one is recommending the Gaea trilogy by John Varlay
68057,Arkady and Boris Strugatsky - Roadside Picnic
68058,"That's a pretty good list: I added blindsight and ancillary justice to my reading list, having never heard of either one.

I'd add Childhoods End and Way Station and Stranger in a Strange Land, if you're building a reading list."
68059,"Nobody has mentioned John Varley.

The Titan Trilogy is absolutely incredible."
68060,Definitely.  Was way ahead of it's time when it came out.
68061,"Titan is truly great. Wizard is OK, Demon just gets silly."
68062,"I love scifi books, but I just couldn't get through the Neuromancer. I hate starting books and not finishing them, but the Neuromancer is so hard to understand. I've heard partly its because it hasn't aged well, a lot of the language/terms used don't apply much anymore. Has anyone else experienced this?"
68063,I felt foolish from my inability to get even the gist of Neuromancer. The feeling was worsened by my feeling for the guy who recommended it is someone whom I really respect intellectually.
68064,"Not sure if this counts as Sci-Fi, but The Martian was great"
68065,"I always feel like a crazy person when I start laughing out loud while reading a book... damn you Hitchhiker's why you so good.

I would also recommend 

**Old Man's War** by John Scalzi
A simpler yet wonderfully written novel with some unique ideas. Focuses more on the story and characters and doesn't go all in on the sci-fi tech like some do.

and 

**Fire Upon the Deep**by Vernor Vinge
Space opera with some big ideas, also has a fantastically unique point of view character of an alien species."
68067,Feel like the canticle of lebowitz is missing from your list.
68068,"Some of my favourites up there. Would recommend Old mans war, maybe Rama and definitely Revelation Space series. Cant neglect to mention and or all Olaf Stapleton's There are soo many more. Love space Sci fi!"
68069,"**WOW**

I just posted this comment and auto-moderator immediately notified me with a message that Ann Leckie will be doing an AMA. Is this accidental or deliberate? **Is that why her book is somehow miraculously at the no.1 spot above countless classics??**. Because the list is just another form of shameless promotion like we're overfed in r/books with countless pop-productions such as the Martian, Ready Player One and other ""brilliant"" stuff?

 Yeah.... wouldn't be the first time eddit would allow for astroturfing in all form would it now...

My original comment below. Kind of takes a different shape now....

------

Edit2: I just got two more notifications. Someone is pushing this AMA really hard...

------

This is going to be the sarcastic, complaining/ranting comment that expresses distaste at those anonymous stupid lists of irrelevant stuff that are all over the internet. Consider yourself warned.

 That looks to me like the standard reddit list ""here are the books I read and liked but let's pretend like they are some universally recognized classics. Typical work of an armchair sci-fi expert.  At the same time so many things which genuinely warrant your attention and time are missing here.... Sigh.  

Genuine ""you should definitely read because it's a classic"" in **bold**. Genuine ""you should definitely read because it's mindblowing"" in *italics*. Rest is just yet another book which you can read or not...if you don't nothing really happens.

Ancillary Justice   (wtf is *that* at no. 1 spot?)       
**Starship Troopers**     
**Neuromancer**     
John Dies at the End     
**War of the Worlds**    
Eisenhorn        
*Blindsight*        
**Ender’s Game** (obligatory Speaker of the Dead)     
**Dune** (obligatory first four books to Emperor of Dune)    
Redshirts: A Novel With Three Codas    
**The Hyperion Cantos**    
**The Forever War**    
Seveneves     
**Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?**    
*Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*     
   
The Guide is a classic but hardly a proper *sci-fi* classic - it's more of an absurdist comedy thing but it's mindblowing anyway and it's a literary classic in its own right.

Notice that with the ""read or not"" books there's exactly 10 positions on the list - which is better just as 10 commandments is better than 15.  

Good strong list (although with some important books still missing) and not diluted with derivatives or irrelevant positions."
68070,"I definitely agree, although based on the quality of the titles and the order I assumed this was just a list rather than a ranking.

I would definitely say A Fire Upon the Deep was far superior in scope, vision, and depth than Ancillary Justice, for instance."
68071,Tack on *Red Mars* and *Accelerando* and you have yourself a deal!
68072,I tried so hard to like Red Mars. I did.
68073,"Shunnn.

But seriously that book is hit or miss. Some of my friends it inspired to no end, myself included. One of the best scifi I've ever read. Others, friends I excitedly lent the book to, it just didn't work for. To each their own I suppose."
68074,"I've read six of the 15 in the list - its a good list. Nice seeing Simmons on there. I would say that I'm surprised not to see Asimov though, considering the impact the Robots stories had on the genre."
68075,Pretty good list despite that click baity title.
68076,"My first exposure to SciFi was: 'Martian Chronicles' - by Ray Bradbury

Was hooked after that."
68077,"Are people supposed to be posting spoilers in threads titled ""books you should read""? Doesn't seem like a very bright idea. Just a thought. Not saying OP has, but some other folks have."
68078,Upvoted for Hyperion
68079,Ancillary Justice is far overrated.  The big reveal was completely predictable and it just seemed to plod on.
68080,"The Man who Folded himself by David Gerrold deserves an honorary mention, imho. That book (really, only a long short story of about 170 pages) really made my head smoke."
68081,The foundation series and snowcrash
68082,Foundation trilogy?
68083,"Am currently reading the Foundation series. 
I'm surprised it was left out seeing as it is such a classic and is actually very, very good. Even if there's little to no actually action in it, it's a fantastic series."
68084,"•Aurora by Kim Stanley Robinson

•Pushing Ice by Alastair Reynolds

•Ophiuchi Hotline by John Varley

•Beyond the Aquila Rift by Alastair Reynolds

•Glory Season by David Brin

Reasons: the scope and ideas behind the first four made my head spin and the fifth one has extremely interesting storyline I enjoyed immensely.

Edit: formatting."
68085,I love pushing ice too. I thought this book was widely disliked?
68086,">I love pushing ice too. I thought this book was widely disliked?

Hardly, it's probably his second most recommended novel after House of Suns"
68087,It's one of the weaker novels but I didn't hate it.
68088,"I love Glory Season. I haven't seen much attention granted to it out in the wild, so I'm glad to see someone else who enjoyed it!"
68089,"I really dig *Ophiuchi Hotline*, but I feel Varley's short story collection *The Persistence of Vision* outperforms this novel."
68090,"Aurora was excellent.  I read it just after, and as a counterpoint to Seveneves."
68092,Love the Dispossessed!
68093,Canticle is one of my favorite books I’ve read in the past two years!  I know some people find it dry but I find it’s descriptions fantastic.
68094,"This is the list that comes off the top of my head. In no particular order. 

* Hyperion - Dan Simmons
* The Cyberiad -  Stanislaw Lem
* The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  - Robert Heinlein
* The Player of Games - Ian M Banks
* The Dispossessed - Ursula Le Guin"
68095,"Like a lil anarchy in your sci fi, eh?"
68096,Is Player if Games the chess type competition one? Pretty sure I have read that but so sketchy on it. If it is the one I am thinking of it was excellent. Also loved Use of Weapons by Banks.
68097,Yeah that’s the one.
68098,"The usual suspects:

**Neal Stephenson - Anathem** Unique, epic. Loved the monasteries.

**Peter Watts - Blindsight** Like watching Alien for the first time.

**Richard K. Morgan - Altered Carbon** Such an entertaining rush.
 
**Frank Herbert - Dune** I think it is SF. Intriguing ideas about transcending human nature, and great worldbuilding.

**Olaf Stapledon - Star Maker** Eloquent and enormous amount of vision."
68099,"Love Altered Carbon and and Dune. The TV series of AC left me really unimpressed though. 

Got to admit that I got about a third of the way through Anathem and put it down to read another book and then just haven’t gone back to it in a couple of years. The maths was hard."
68100,"Took me three goes of anathem. There's a point in the book where everything clicks and then you (i) say 'that's my favourite book'.

I don't like any other neal stephenson but that's a masterpiece right there"
68101,"Remember where abouts that is? Interested to know if I was close to it. 

Light spoilers below... 


Last I remember there was the bunch of guys at the monastery and they were meeting in secret to solve a crime that they thought some of the leadership may have been involved in, then they got busted and exiled, but not all of them I think. 

It has been a long time since I was reading it."
68102,It's a big book and I'd say it was approx halfway. Lots of investment but it went from something dubious to something fantastic in an instant to me. The excessive worldbuilding pays off.
68103,"The part in exile is actually where it really starts to kick in.  It gets weirder until, as the other posters have said, it turns a corner and it all clicks, which is satisfying for like a million different reasons..  it’s earned and not contrived. In my opinion Stephenson’s best ending, I feel like I see other posters give him shit about not being able to finish a book.  Anyway, Anathem is one of my favorite books :)"
68104,"Try Reamde, I'm not a massive fan of his writing either, however Reamde was a good read but not exactly scifi more modern fiction thriller with modern tech sprinkled in."
68105,"I can't remember where, but I remember hearing that the sequels to Dune were not great. Have you read them, and what is your take?"
68106,I'm actually reading the sequels right now for the first time. Dune Messiah was quite different but good in its own way. I've been told to read only the sequels written by Frank Herbert himself and that all the others are trash.
68107,"* Hyperion by Dan Simmons
* Diaspora by Greg Egan
* Starfish by Peter Watts
* House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds
* The Cyberiad by Stanislaw Lem

Hyperion felt like (and sort of is) six books rolled into one. The characters are fantastic and each of their tale fascinating and horrible to varying degrees. It's the only book on my list which I feel is an absolute must read.

Diaspora was surreal and dreamlike. Its themes are (non-romantic) love, humanity, loneliness, loss, and hope. It's difficult to talk about without spoiling it.

Starfish's atmosphere is amazing. It's about a group of outcasts being sent to live at the bottom of the ocean. People usually highlight how creepy the book was, but I found it to be a strangely comforting setting. I still think about it. And I kind of want to move there!

House of Suns is my favorite Reynolds novel. It's fairly optimistic when compared to Revelation Space. This is space opera on a huge scale. There are several scenes in House of Suns that will never leave me (especially the sectioning - yikes). I think it's the go-to novel for people who want to get introduced to Reynolds.

The Cyberiad... I can't describe it. I wouldn't make it justice. It's such a strange collection of stories, far from anything else I've read. It's sad to think how so many books are generic and interchangeable when you know that the potential of the genre is so much greater."
68108,"Wow, thanks for all the detail. Definitely will put Hyperion in the list after your recommendation. Is this related to Ilium at all or a stand alone?"
68109,"It's the first book of a series unrelated to Ilium and Olympos. :) Sounds great! It's a true classic.

I saw that you put The Stars My Destination by Bester on your top five list - I loved that book. Definitely a good pick. <3"
68110,"Love Stars, not a book or an author that has really gotten the recognition that I think they deserve. I have recommended it to a lot of people. 

So I will start with Hyperion and go from there. Thanks."
68111,"I loved Hyperion, but hated the Endymion books that are sort of a sequel. IMHO, they retro-actively lessen the first book."
68113,It's one of my favorites. Love the different stories and how they're told. The world built is awesome.
68114,"\[Edits \- more explanation\]

These are books I always come back to

* Altered Carbon \- Richard Morgan

Great cyberpunk novel I think.  Just good fun.

* Dune \- Frank Herbert

I love the universe of Dune.  So much in there.

* Excession \- Iain M Banks

Banks has so many, I like this one as it's mainly from Minds point of view.

* Foundation series \- Asimov

The idea of applying statistical mechanics to human history.  It was great how he tied it all back to the Robots series in the end.

* Old Man's War \-  John Scalzi

Military sci fi \- also who doesn't want a new lease on life as a superhuman.

* Snowcrash \- Neal Stephenson

Cyberpunk

There are so many!

I always have a fondness for Gordon R Dickinson's Childe Cycle which never seems to get mentioned.  Dorsai! is a good jumping in point.  Soldier, Ask Not which I lent to a co\-worker and he said it was unusual having an anti hero as the main focus.

Shout out to Blindsight mentioned by @HumanSieve \- I think I love SF novels which have a great concept that I never thought of before \- dodging saccades and consciousness \(which we as humans think of as our defining characteristic\) as a crutch

City and the Stars \- Clarke \- soft spot for this one as its one of the first I read \- also a great sense of mystery and history and exploration and breaking outside of the bubble of society

A Scanner Darkly \- Phil K Dick \- a lot of PKD I think is hard to digest for me but this is autobiographical and relatable and still a killer ending

Neal Stephenson's later works too, always interesting.

Stephen Baxter's work I liked just because of the sheer scale of his vision.  And the dystopian view of the future.  The Exultant series \- doctrine, humankind all pushing towards one goal against technological superiority, military discipline in the face of FTL causality breaches, deep history

I really enjoyed N. K. Jemisin's series that won the Hugo."
68115,"* Seveneves - Neil Stephenson
* Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card
* Eon - Greg Bear
* Hyperion - Dan Simmons 
* We Are Legion (We Are Bob) - Dennis Taylor"
68116,"1. A Civil Campaign, by Lois McMaster Bujold.   
The culmination of the entire series, with almost every thread throughout the series pulled taut. So many loveable characters in a sci\-fi Regency\-esque political romance.  

2. Mirror Dance, by Lois McMaster Bujold.  
A sudden but natural shift in the series, with a new character examining Miles' life from outside. A welcome perspective, though tonally dark.  

3. Armor, by John Steakley.  
A story of two threads, blending perfectly. Felix, a soldier in an eternal war against alien bugs along the lines of Starship Troopers, matched with Jack Crow, a space pirate whom IMO Disney ripped off \(and then made family friendly\) for Pirates of the Carribbean.  

4. Fall of Hyperion, by Dan Simmons.  
The first book fell majorly flat for me, but its protagonists were thankfully cast in a new light by this sequel, which allows them to actually reach their destination. The conclusion of Fall of Hyperion is about as epic a SciFi book can manage \- it's probably my favorite ending ever, possibly tied with Armor above.  

5. Oryx and Crake, by Margaret Atwood.  
Post\-apocalyptic done right. It tells in retrospective the story of how humanity went in extinct. A beautiful and painful expose of humanity in its last years, with a larger\-than\-life antagonist."
68117,"I've not seen many people talking about Fall of Hyperion or its ending. I loved the first book but only got halfway into the second. I didn't dislike it or intentionally stop reading, but I didn't find it nearly as interesting as the first. I'm going to have to pick it up again."
68118,"Here's my go. No particular order:

* Anathem - Stephenson.
* Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card. 
* The Martian - Andy Weir.
* Revelation Space - Alastair Reynolds.
* The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi."
68119,"I really wish Hannu Rajaniemi got the attention he deserves. That trilogy is amazing. So many interesting concepts, ideas, and settings."
68120,"Book of the new sun - Gene wolfe
Dune - Frank Herbert
1984 - George Orwell
The Moon is a harsh mistress - Robert Heinlein 
Neuromancer - William Gibson

A clock work orange ( might not be a sci-fi but a great story set in the near future ) - Anthony Burgess"
68121,"Anthony Burgess wasn't a SF writer, but A Clockwork Orange was definitely SF. Great book. If I may use a cliche: The movie wasn't as good as the book."
68122,"The cine was so gloopy, I re read the book of our droog while peeting me some firegold, proper. It was a real horrowshow, as I had remembered it to be."
68123,"One of the few films I prefer to he book myself, especially the ending. The other that comes to mind is Blade Runner/DADOES?"
68124,"Top 5? Difficult!

1. Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams

2. Dune - Frank Herbert 

3. Player of Games - Iain M. Banks

4. Dark Forest - Liu Cixin (book 2 in Remembrance of Earth’s Past series)

5. Foundation - Isaac Asimov 

Pretty safe choices but man these books have had a lasting impact."
68125,Dark Forest is a great pick. Definitely the best in the series. Three Body Problem was also fantastic.
68126,"Ha, tbh I didn’t even think of Hitchhikers guide when I started this. I love that book but it isn’t in my mind as a sci-fi book, although it totally is."
68127,"* The City and the Stars - Arthur C Clarke
* Pushing Ice - Alastair Reynolds
* Commonwealth Saga (Pandora's Star & Judas Unchained) - Peter F Hamilton
* Player of Games - Iain M Banks
* Hyperion - Dan Simmmons

Commonwealth Saga is probably my all time favorite, so many amazing aliens and i really think i love space operas. I will never forget first reading the chapter on MorningLightMountain."
68128,A great mention for The MorningLightMountain chapter - truly memorable.
68129,I have Pandora’s Star on Audible but it’s about 3 weeks long... kidding obviously but what’s with the length?
68130,"He's incredibly descriptive, almost too much description. If he wasn't a science fiction writer, it'd be immensely too much... But when you're describing a planet and the civilization that grew up on it, I feel like you're justified in near excessive description. 

Not to mention he does trend towards too many characters and having a massive cast. But I still think they're some of the best books written, for what they are. Nothing too introspective, not a whole lot of hidden messaging... Just a solid space opera where the good guys usually win and gallivanting around the Galaxy isn't taken too seriously. I wish there were more books like his."
68131,So I hear Commonwealth has the best aliens... should this be wear I plant my Hamilton flag?
68132,"- The Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov
- The Mote in God's Eye by Niven and Pournelle
- Raising the Stones by Sheri Tepper
- Time Enough for Love by Robert Heinlein
- Snow Crash or Diamond Age (tie) by Neal Stephenson"
68133,"I’d have trouble recommending Raising the Stones without recommending the reader start with Grass, no?"
68134,"Yes, it's a sequel to Grass, but barely - Raising the Stones could stand alone. Grass is good, too, but Raising the Stones is the one I like best."
68135,"Sure and me too.  The subtle power of the loose trilogy of Grass, Raising the Stones and Sideshow, to me, is the larger Fact to Legend to Religion progression of the story as it passes through the books"
68136,"(1) The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (Heinlein)

Note that this was written during the golden age of sci fi, and hippies were just becoming a thing. Heinlein is one of the grandfathers of modern science fiction, and I'd rate him alongside Asimov and Clarke. If you like this, also try Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land. 

(2) Hyperion (Simmons)

This one ends on a cliffhanger. It is recommended you continue to read Fall of Hyperion afterwards. It really should be one book. Very good. You may also enjoy the next two in the Hyperion Cantos series.

(3) Ender's Game (Card)

A classic in modern sci fi. Main character is a young child being indoctrinated to become a military leader. Good story, exciting environments, relateable characters.

(4) Player of Games (Banks)

Bank wrote ten books in a series known as the Culture. This is book two. The books can be read in any order, but this one is a good entry point. The Culture is everything that is good about Le Guin magnified.

(5) The Martian (Wier)

It is like popcorn. You just read, and smile, and be entertained. Read it while camping somewhere remote for added effect."
68137,"1. Count Zero - William Gibson
2. Neuromamcer - William Gibson
3. Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson 
4. Idoru - William Gibson
5. Random Acts of Senseless Violence - Jack Womack"
68138,Mona Lisa didn’t make it. Why did you prefer Count Zero to Neuromancer?
68139,"Far too many to pick from; here are the first five books I spotted on my ""Favorites"" bookshelf:

* Antarctica by Kim Stanley Robinson
* Friday by Robert A. Heinlein
* Foundation by Isaac Asimov
* Nonstop by Brian Aldiss
* The Dying Earth by Jack Vance"
68140,"Nonstop almost made my list, and I was gonna say Dying Earth but went with book 2 in the saga instead. Great choices!"
68141,"I loved Antarctica. It's one of Robinson's early novels and besides the fact that it's a good book in its own right, it also features the seeds of the themes that Robinson would develop more fully in his later books. Namely: 

- (the impossibility of) reimagining/recreating society from scratch- Mars Trilogy

- politics of climate change/science- Science in the Capital Trilogy

- other things that I can't quite remember haha

(In particular, he is really talented at presenting a wide range of really believable perspectives.)"
68142,"I love the book because he's putting the new society on Earth, where I could believe it a little more.  In fact, in parts it reads more like an adventure from a strange land than science fiction.  But I do believe Antarctica came after the Mars Trilogy.

One other overreaching theme I first noticed in this book was his ideal woman type - tall, strong, athletic, independent in actions.  I've seen those also in his later books (don't know yet whether Freya in Aurora falls into this category; I'm only about a third through the book), but KSR was on top of his game in writing about such a woman.  In Science in the Capital (individual books; didn't read the shorter collection) he was just swooning over softball players, without much subtlety."
68143,Definitely has a an ideal female in mind. And oops wrt the dates
68144,">other things that I can't quite remember haha

How about the book is concluded with a big official talk-fest by the various characters. This seems to be a feature of some of his work.

I did enjoy Antartica though."

* Blindsight - Peter Watts
* Diaspora - Greg Egan
* Dragon's Egg - Robert L. Forward
* Roadside Picnic - Arkady Strugatsky"
68152,"Against a Dark Background is my all time favourite book, any genre, period. Bleak as hell but doesn't look like it at first. By the end you realize that everything is futile. People like to say humanity's position in the Cultureverse is to show how insignificant we are. I found Golter's situation a lot more scary. 

Excession is just great, in basically almost every possible way. Shows that humanoids are again, insignificant. A book mostly about Minds will be great any day. 

Blindsight is scarier than any horror, without actually pulling (too much) horror elements. It petrifies the mind. Sadly Echopraxia didn't pull off any similar effect. 

Glasshouse. Stross is always full of ideas, but I found the A-gates and how he incorporated them in his world really fascinating. 

Man, too much to pick one last. Let's say Dune Messiah. Love Paul's arc, and Herbert really started the expansion on what he meant by prescience not being a joke."
68153,I thought Dune Messiah was an almost perfect sequel to Dune. I just wish there had been more of it.
68154,Excession is one of my favourites!
68155,"More of a combination of individual books and series:

* Dune by Frank Herbert- I like the entire series but the original book is best.
* Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.
* Ringword Series by Larry Niven - in fact most of his Known Space collection is good.
* Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement.
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey - started watching the show and read the books and they have really revived my love of reading which I have to admit has dwindled in the past while.

There are many more I hold in equal esteem but I will limit to the original request of 5."
68156,"Just like others have said it is hard to just pick 5 but here we go.

1.	Dune- Frank Herbert. Obviously. It’s amazing!
2.	Hyperion- Dan Simmons. This book is like several stories wrapped into one. Set in an expansive well thought out and creative universe. You really need to read the whole cantos though.
3.	Starship Troopers- Robert A. Heinlein. Just forget the movie it was horrible (I actually like it for its own cheesy merits but it is not even close to the book) 
4.	Forever War- Joe Haldeman. Where Starship Troopers could almost be considered military recruitment propaganda, Forever War would be its opposite. Think Vietnam but in space. 
5.	Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep- Philip K. Dick. A book that left me with so many thoughts and questions but in a good and satisfying way not in a frustrating way.

Honorable mentions

6.	Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Count Zero- William Gibson. All three count as one because I feel like you should read them all. These books started a genre of their own and influenced a lot of books and movies.

7.	1984- George Orwell. Probably the best book on the list except I’m not sure it really fits the essence of the sci-fi genre.
8.	A Clockwork Orange- Anthony Burgess. Same reasons as 1984.
9.	Oryx and Crake- Margret Atwood. Kind of disturbed me but very thought provoking and well written.
10. Ringworld- Larry Niven. Great concept, huge universe.

Guilty pleasures

11. Electric Church- Jeff Somers. Gritty, futuristic, guns, action, good main character.

12. The Last Exodus- Paul Tassi. Heavy gaming influence so really fun read if you’re into that kind of thing.

Edit: formatting"
68157,"Oryx & crake was so good I couldn’t finish MadAdam. 

[spoiler](/s ”foreshadowing indicated favorite narrators would not be narrating after the a certain event at the end so I stopped right there. I loved them so much…”)"
68158,I agree with your assessment of the movie of Starship Troopers 100%. Do you want to know more? :)
68159,"Yep, I'd put those 5 in my list as well.

Although Cyteen (or something else by Cherryh or Bujold) probably replaces Dune.  I liked Dune when I was younger, but not as much these days."
68160,>I actually love the movie.  It is NOT the book but I think Paul Verohoven was trying to say different things.  If you watch it thinking he is playing a trick on us all it is amazing....
68161,"Dune - Frank Herbert

Doomsday Book - Connie Willis

Replay - Ken Grimwood

Exultant - Stephen Baxter

11/22/63 by Stephen King"
68162,"In no particular order, I sort of like them all the same:

* **The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers = The world\-building is incredible and I just really like the way the unique and wonderful characters on board the ship all work so well together to keep the ship running \(kind of like 'FTL: Faster Than Light' in novel form, that's the best way I can describe it\).
* **Neuromance**r by William Gibson = The imagery is right up my ally, the cyberpunk noir genre is amazing and this is simply one of the best books I've ever read.
* **Forever War** by Joe Haldeman = I don't even remember much about the actual storyline of this book other than that I enjoyed every page, and the Starship Troopers\-esque battle scenes are brilliant. Very fine military sci\-fi.
* **Ninefox Gambit** by Yoon Ha Lee = Just insanely good. I love the harsh, military world and the epic space battles have some the best imagery I've ever read. Might not be something people agree with but I find it reminiscent of Warhammer 40K, at least what I've experienced of that universe.
* **Dune** by Frank Herbert = It's just a classic, really, and while I didn't enjoy it in the same way as some others, it stands the test of time and is a really enjoyable read despite its length. The dialogue really is incredible, and the book is honestly entirely driven by the fantastic characterisation in my opinion."
68163,"Memory by Lois McMaster Bujold

Lt Leary Commanding by David Drake

Dragonsdawn by Anne McCaffrey

One Second After by William Forstchen

Shards of Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold

I am a Space Opera fan, so sue me :-)"
68164,"This is an interesting response to me, as I found One Second After to be the most poorly written and edited book I have ever read. May I ask what put it in your top 5? Curious how we reacted so differently to it."
68165,"I absolutely love the genre of, ""a community reacts to disaster"" and all the reactions in One Second After strike me as authentic. All the characters do what they want to do, rather than just because the author is trying to set up a scene.

The writing and editing are perfectly acceptable IMHO. Forstchen has been writing perfectly acceptable pulp genre novels for decades. If you are a fan of literary fiction that would explain our different responses (I don't care for that flowery garbage ;-)  If you are left wing politically (I vote for whoever is going to rack up the least debts) you might be offended enough by the politics to have developed a grudge against the writing and editing.

For me it stands side by side with Lucifer's Hammer at the top of its genre."
68166,"Well, this is impossible, but what the hell:I love Herbert, Simmons,  Miéville, et. al. so I am going to try to add a few who aren't listed by some of the others.

Wm. Gibson, Count Zero--the sequel to Neuromancer.  I think it is a better novel and it can be read as a stand alone.

Jack Vance--Tales of the Dying Earth--love the genre and he is the master of it.  Science fantasy at its best. (although Gene Wolfe's Book of the new Sun is close second).

Ursula K. LeGuin, The Lathe of Heaven, just because her other two gems were already listed and I think this one is a poetic gem that rewards with each rereading.

Olaf Stapledon, Last and First Men--really anything by him but this one, and Star Maker are profound.

Michael Swanwich, The Iron Dragon's Daughter--he has several good books but this is the one I loved the best."
68167,"Reading Vance is like comfort food for me, he's just so much fun."
68168,"The Stars My Destination is dripping with schlock. It is so pulpy that it'd make an orange blush.

But I love it."
68169,"Ha! Exactly. It is pulpy and has some dodgy 50s styled scenes and dialogue, but it was pretty dark at times (that one event that is alluded to shocked me when I read it knowing the era the boom came from).

For all its flaws, this book is basically the prototype cyberpunk novel. Neuromancer put it all together and birthed the subgenre, but this book laid the blueprint for it. Imbedded technology, moral decline, and an complete social upheaval due to unchecked technological advancement are all here. I think I read years ago Gibson praising the importance of this often forgotten novel. 

When I am stuck in traffic or being herded at an airport I think of this novel and just wish I could simply transport myself to where I need to go."
68170,"I never thought of it like that, but you are right. The corporation-as-government aspect is a huge part of cyberpunk and this novel lays that out nicely. One of my favorite scenes is when the government agent is led through a labyrinth to finally meet with the CEO/patriarch and then jaunts out of the place as a way to say ""I know where you live."""
68171,"The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin 
Remembrance of Earth’s Past by Cixin Liu
His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman (which defies categorization but might as well be sci-fi) 
Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut
Dawn by Octavia Butler"
68172,"I'm going to buck the trend and include short story collections in mine:  


* Her Smoke Rose Up Forever by James Tiptree, Jr.  

* Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu  

* The Story Of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang  

* Veniss Underground by Jeff Vandermeer  

* The Solar Cycle by Gene Wolfe (though calling the entire thing science fiction is probably enough of a stretch that it's an outright lie)  

Honorable Mention:  Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin"
68173,"Iain M Banks - All of them . 
Verner Vinge - A fire upon the deep .    
Ursula le Guin - Left Hand of Darkness .  
Frank Herbert - Dune .  
Philip K Dick - short story collection ."
68174,"I do realise you said all of them, but does this include ‘Transition’ by Banks? It’s a favourite of mine, rarely mentioned on Reddit, and was looking to see what others thought about it."
68175,"Well I've only really gotten into reading the last couple of years, and I'm not the fastest of readers so it's not easy for me to come up with a top 5 list. I've read more than 5 sure, but some were just okay and not any I'd rank on a top list.

-Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. They're fun reads. Scalzi creates an interesting universe with sharp plot twists and even sharper solutions to the twists.

-Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M Miller Jr. I'm not usually big on post-apocalyptic settings, but this one is good. It's a good speculative look at humanity as to what events unfold after nuclear holocaust.

-The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. I was skeptical with the first few chapters, but it turned into a good read about a soldier's look at a long war and the effects of time dilation on not only the war itself, but the change in human culture.

-Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. My first cyberpunk book, and it was blended well between stuff going on in the real and digital worlds. Also an interesting display of what anarchy might look like.

-The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. This one I had to toss in because I haven't read as much at I'd like yet. It's certainly a good book and obviously a classic in sci-fi. But I also love that it's from so long ago and different look at how alien invasion might look before the atomic age. Also, I think there's something about writing styles from that era that I like because I love Jack London's writing as well, and I feel they're similar styles.

That being said, I see so many books repeated in other posts here that I either have (Dune, Hyperion) or will soon get (Foundation, or a few Reynolds' books) and I'm excited to get to them."
68176,"In no special order:

- ""Roadside Picnic"" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky
- The trilogy ""The Three Body Problem"", ""The Dark Forest"" and ""Death's End"" by Cixin Liu
- ""UBIK"" by Philip K Dick
- ""The Star Diaries"" by Stanislaw Lem
- ""Embassytown"" by China Miéville

... and if there WERE a sixth spot on this list it surely had to be ""The Carpetmakers"" by Andreas Eschbach ;)"
68177,"Great to see someone else list Ubik. I remember one my first read and yelling out ‘oh what the hell!’ When I got to the end and my GF popping her head around the corner looking concerned. Got her to start reading it that day. 

Need to re-read it."
68178,"Ha, it was the same with me, more or less. And it has been the first book I read from PKD. When I rented it in the library I didn't barely know PKD, I just knew that Blade Runner was loosely based on one of his stories. So I took the only book available then and it was UBIK and I was in for a treat! :)"
68179,"Parable of the sower- Octavia Butler

The Diamond Age- Neal Stevenson

Hyperion Cantos- Dan Simmons

The Water Knife- Paulo Bacigalupi

A Fire Upon the Deep- Vernor Vinge

Oryx and Crake- Margaret Atwood

Couldn't pare it down to 5, oh well."
68180,"**MY TOP 10 SCI-FI**:

* Samuel R. Delany - Empire Star / The Ballad of Beta-2 (amazing stories and beautifully written)

* Ursula LeGuin - Left Hand of Darkness (just a great look at another culture through the lens of an observer)

* William Gibson - Count Zero (better than Neuromancer IMO)

* Charles Stross - Accelerando (really opened my eyes to the power of writing and what can be achieved with SF - Glasshouse is great as a spiritual sequel)

* Alejandro Jodorowsky / Moebius - The Incal (it is a Graphic Novel, but so very important in the SF landscape. If you haven't had the pleasure then pick it up now. There is a collected version in print now)

* Issac Asimov - Foundation trilogy (love the scope and generation-spanning nature of the storytelling. Some brilliant ideas as well)

* Theodore Sturgeon - More Than Human (moving, human story about outcasts with special powers. Love this book)

* Phillip K. Dick - The Man In The High Castle (such a great treatise on art and culture)

* Warren Ellis - Transmetropolitan (again a graphic novel, which can be unpopular on this sub, but something I think all SF readers would appreciate reading)

* Iain M. Banks - Matter (not the normal suggestion when people list their favourite Culture novels, but this one was subtle and really well done. Reminded me a lot of Ursula Leguin)

edit: added in reasons :)"
68181,"No need to pit any disclaimers to Warren Ellis; in my opinion he's one of the finest current sci-fi authors.  I love most of his stuff, in particular *Transmetropolitan*, but I'm afraid he's overextending himself a little right now.  He's got three ongoing series: *Trees* and *Injection* are definitely science fiction, and both are excellent.  Most recently he rebooted *Wild C.A.Ts*, which is more of a superhero kind of sci-fi (the original and related titles, such as *Stormwatch* and *Authority* are still among my favorite superhero books), but I'm somewhat ambivalent about his latest effort.  I'm afraid that with so many projects at once he'll do another *Planetary* and essentially abandon the stories."
68182,"In this sub, I have encountered some resistance to the comic book medium. Surprisingly, as I would have thought readers of sci-fi to be more receptive to marginalised media.

Orbiter is also a great SF story of his. Ellis' obsession with spaceflight really shines here.

Grant Morrison would get a mention here too. but then my list would have to also include, Brian K Vaughn and Jeff Lemire and so on..."
68183,">In this sub, I have encountered some resistance to the comic book medium. Surprisingly, as I would have thought readers of sci-fi to be more receptive to marginalised media.

It's simple; comic books are extremely expensive in terms of plot/$ compared to novels, they are also hard to find at libraries and don't work well with e-readers."
68184,"Yeah I feel that. I really feel that they should be more affordable. But they're a collaborative effort so you're paying more people, and they tend to print a lower number when compared to novels. I've never minded paying the money - but that's probably conditioning.

I don't get the e reader argument, but thats just because I'm old fashioned and haven't yet been converted to the modern tech. 😊"
68185,"Orbiter is just wonderful. A beacon of hope and a sense of wonder for the space program. 

Also Ocean is a great stand alone sci-fi graphic novel of his that explores us finding out just what is beneath the icy oceans of Europa...

Planetary is also  sci-fi-esque at times and is considered one of his top works, along with Transmetropolitan of course."
68186,But Planetary is amazing....
68187,Let’s here it for the great Theodore Sturgeon!  He doesn’t get enough attention any more.
68188,"People don’t typically list Matter in their top Iain M. Banks books, but I love it. Glad to see someone else thought so highly of it!"
68189,"It was my first after Consider Phlebas and the story really stuck with me. I always bring it up when people talk about Banks, so I reason that it must be my favourite. :)"
68190,Count Zero is so good. Yeah I liked it more than Nueromancer too.
68191,"I also slightly perfer Count Zero to Neuromancer. I love both but Count Zero seems more ""grand"" in a way while still feeling very personal like Neuromancer. I also love how Gibson vaguely connects the two, the Sprawl feels so lived in."
68192,I love the collage boxes. Such a great idea and made a lasting impression on my memory of the book.
68193,"Yes the boxes were such a good way to show Virek's obsession while linking them to the rest of the overarching plot.

I also love how Count Zero portrays cyberspace and the culture surrounding it when compared to Neuromancer. It's a great expansion."
68194,>Why is Count Zero better?  I read Neuromancer.
68195,"In no particular order...

- Void Star by Zach Mason
This was the best book I read last year. Reminded me of the first time I read any William Gibson. Smart writing. Surprised I don’t hear more about this book.

- Beacon 23 by Hugh Howey

A fairly short book, you can read it in one sitting. Discusses loneliness and depression while working in essentially a lighthouse in space.

-  Wool by Hugh Howey

Just an overall fun and great read. The world of the Silos come alive. I thought the whole trilogy was fantastic. 


- 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke 

One of the first books I read for pleasure. Got me hooked onto sci-fi back when I was in school. An absolute classic I’d recommend anyone to read.


- The Forever War by Joe Haldeman

This one played with some really interesting ideas. Space travel, time dilation. Going to fight a war, only to come back and everyone you’ve ever known is dead and the world has progressed hundreds of years...

Bonus- some may not call it sci-fi but I loved the Blue Ant Trilogy by William Gibson 

I just ate these books up. William Gibson is just such a fun author. So much packed into his books."
68196,Wool is so awesome.
68197,YES to the Hugh Howey books. Completely agree. There were some good lines in Beacon 23.
68198,"Love Forever War, toss up between that and Gateway for my bonus pick. Both have stayed with me years after reading them. 

I loved the Blue Ant trilogy too. Have you read the Bridge trilogy? Why wife **loves** that collection, especially Virtual Light. Do you prefer Blue Ant to Bridge and Sprawl trilogies?"
68199,"Blue Ant is the only one I’ve fully read. I haven’t touched any of the Bridge books but they’re on my to read list. I read Neuromancer years ago just because it’s a classic and tbh I probably didn’t get half of it. I really need to re-read it and then go on to read the next two. Gibson has a new book coming out later this year too, about the 2016 American Election. It might be a Gibson heavy year of reading for me, not that I’m complaining."
68200,"Neuromancer is complex, but I read it after a friend so I had all these super long conversations where we unpacked it so that is part of the love for me. I found that the more I talked it out the more I loved and appreciated it. The two follow ups are great too, I think it is the second one that has a more straight foward and actiony approach which was great. Also, Molly is a fantastic character. 

The Bridge trilogy is excellent. With each of these three trilogies Gibson brought the time closer to the present and stepped down the technology advancements. The Blue Ant felt a little future focused, Bridge trilogy was like 20ish year projection from now with AI and digital printers, and the Sprawl trilogy was super cyber punk and heavy tech. 

Bridge has a nice balance, would recommend them, especially if you liked the Blue Ant set as they more like those than Neuromancer.

Didn’t know a new Gibson was coming out this year,  very exciting!"
68201,"Mostly going to try to list stuff unmentioned 

In the Ocean of Night by Gregory Benford a sweeping saga of humanity vs implacable alien adversary from near future to distant

Snowcrash so incredibly influential it seems cliche if you’ve never read it

Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson hard to go wrong with Robinson

Dhalgren by Samuel R Delaney so trippy 

Celestial Empire series by Chris Roberson alternate history with ascendant China & Aztecs in space

Wasteland of Flint by Thomas Harlan a totally different alternate history future but also Aztecs about an exo anthropologist"
68202,"I've tried *Dhalgren* a few times, just couldn't get into it."
68203,"The Dispossessed, by Ursula Le Guin. I don't think any other book shaped my way of thinking as much as this. 

Little Brother, by Cory Doctorow. This is the book I would have loved to read when I was a teenager. Of course it wasn't out then, but still. I love Doctorow's stories because it's never a lone hero that saves the day, it's always a community coming together. Maybe he's not explicitly saying it, but his leftist ideals are well represented in his writing.

Red Mars and Green Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson. Let's keep with the leftist theme. The Dorsa Brevia declaration is probably the best fictional document ever. And yes, I'm excluding Blue Mars. It was ok, but just take the constitutional congress, add it to Green Mars, then make a small epilogue and it's a huge improvement. 

Anathem, by Neal Stephenson. The whole science monasteries thing is awesome.

A Deepness In The Sky, by Vernor Vinge. Just because of the spiders."
68204,"* Anathem, Neal Stephenson - probably my favorite book.
* The Foundation trilogy, Asimov - mind-blowing sci-fi classic.
* A deepness in the sky, Vernor Vinge - One of the best space operas out there. 
* The Algebraist, Iain Banks - It think it's hard to like Vinge and not like Banks as well. This book has a great scope. Should have been shorter, but it's still a great book. Anything from the Culture series is a must too.
* Dune - This is soft sci-fi but a fantastic book regardless of genre."
68206,"My father had all the L Ron Hubbard novels, including this awesome looking hardback series with really actiony covers. My mother would never let me read them as a kid though, I never knew why, obviously learned about the controversy with Hubbard later. 

Battlefield Earth sounded fun. That film sure was something."
68207,I've got some ridiculous looking Hubbard covers in hardback that I never read. I would just grab them at the used bookstore because they would be 25 cents or so.
68208,Battlefield Earth is a pretty good to very good book.  It's just sad that it's written by LRH.
68209,I'd never heard of Worm before. Nearly 2 million words! Did you read it all at once or over time?
68210,"**A Deepness in the Sky** by Vernor Vinge

**Startide Rising** by David Brin

**Chasm City** by Alastair Reynolds

**Fallen Dragon** by Peter F Hamilton

**The Last Legends of Earth** by A A Attanasio

*A Deepness in the Sky* is to me Vinge's best. Looking forward into a future locked in by our present understanding of technological and physical limits, where humanity can only spread so far before the limits of communication and culture stop any form of commonality. Then intersect 'out of context problems' (think Excession!) and introduce a horrible weaponised disease. So much extrapolation as well. Such an amazing book.

*Startide Rising* was my first taste of Brin, and may still be the best. The sequels diluted the galactic-spanning mysteries of this book to its detriment. But the dynamics between the human and dolphin crew coming apart at the seams are amazing. Heroism and evil emerge in an environment quite unlike any other.

*Chasm City* is Reynold's first tour of the 'Rust Belt', the remains of a system-wide civilisation destroyed by the terrors of a biomechanical plague that seems all to possible in this day and age with our internet security issues. The civilisation that remains still has its own issues, crooks, and adventurers. Chasm City plumbs the depths of high adventure with mindbending excursions in memory and loss. Highly recommended.

*Fallen Dragon* by Peter F Hamilton is one of his few standalone novels, and because of this, works very, very well. At a time when interstellar travel is closing down due to economic necessities, multiplanetary corporates are still keen on 'asset realisation' by extracting their revenue by any means necessary. Of the mercenaries employed by them comes to the realisation that a planet he has been deployed to may by the hiding spot of crashed alien. Parallel to the story, is a narrative on the mercenary's early life which ties into the contemporary story in startling and unpredictable ways. 

*The Last Legends of Earth* is a book that must be read to be believed. I can't do a description justice. Billions of years after the destruction of Earth humans are resurrected by an alien as bait in a trap in a cosmic war against one of the more horrific aliens in SF. Humans are told that these god-like beings are not gods, but they choose their own sides, and an adventure that transcends time and space entertains with both tragedy and triumph. This is one of those books to treasure..."
68211,I'm so glad to see Attanasio on one of these lists!
68212,"Some of his books I'm not so hot on, but this one is exceptional. I must re-read *Radix* sometime. *Wyvern* is also a beautiful bit of historical fantasy."
68213,"This is a great challenge. Top 5? Damn.

* Dune \- Frank Herbert. A master class in intrigue, action, and world building. Plus, sand worm riding.
* Neuromancer \- Gibson. Still the most compelling near\-future dystopian setting. Set the bar for hacking and cyberpunk aesthetics.
* Rendezvous with Rama \- Arthur C. Clarke. Grand vision, still the most compelling first contact, sense\-of\-wonder setting.
* Lord of Light \- Zelazny. Yeah, it's sci\-fi through and though.
* When the dream dies \- A. Bertram Chandler. No objective value, but my first contact with large scale sci\-fi, after Asimov. Great adventure stories.

I have to say, at some point I just went for the books I remember most fondly, because the list here is long. I'd probably have trouble sorting through my top 50, let alone 5..."
68214,Lord of Light was a total trip. After I read the book I had a thousand questions.
68215,"I first read it when I was in my early teens. I did not understand the sci-fi angle. Then I read it a decade or so later, and I couldn't believe how blind I'd been the first time around. I must have read it half a dozen times since."
68216,"If you havent yet, do read American Gods as well ( definitely read before you watch the TV Series )"
68217,"Yeah read that when it came out, was a big Gaiman fan. Has the TV series come out?"
68218,"Yep the first season is out, and it was surprisingly good. Certainly had it's strong moments"
68219,"I already put my list up, but thinking about it again, I'd have to add **Lord of Light**. It's just incredible.

I know that it was used as the fake movie they were going to make told in Ben Affleck's 'Argo', but I would love to see this as an actual movie."
68221,"I just finished Solaris and still processing what I think about it. I liked his points on humanity exploring space, and a different look at possible life forms. 

But I was also greatly annoyed with anger being Kelvin's immediate response to most everything. I think it's a disgusting human trait when person's first response is to defend their ego before even considering what someone was actually saying (or trying to say). I've dealt with enough people like that in life, and it's a turn off.

Plus there were a couple chapters that the author just seemed to dully babble on about symmetriads, asymmetriads, and other multiple theories. Just seemed like there was more in those chapters than was necessary for the plot and/or character development."
68222,"I am listing recommendations rather than top five because most of the books listed here are also some of my favorites. 

Carrion Comfort — Dan Simmons

This book is a wonderful blend of Sci Fi/Horror about people who can telepathically control people to commit acts of violence, often murder, to live longer. Lots of twists and turns to keep you up at night. Very intense. 

Dreamsnake — Vonda N. McCintyre 

Set in a post apocalypse world where the main Character is a female doctor who heals people with three different snakes, but the most important one is killed by accident so she sets on a quest to find a replacement. 

Hothouse — Brian Aldiss

A book where the majority of humans on Earth are killed off because of green house gasses. Whats left are plant based humanoids who struggle to survive in a dangerous world overran by deadly vegetation. 

The Einstein Intersection — Samuel R. Delany 

This one is hard to explain you should read a synopsis by the author to get a better idea. But also a good read. 

The Gods Themselves — Isaac Asimov 

Man searches for alternative clean sustainable energy, but there is cost. Not gonna say anymore,  ( I don’t want to spoil it) however I highly recommend this one.  Works on the idea of parallel universes.  


Some short reads by HP Lovecraft I recommend if you have not read them yet 

BE WARNED, these may give you night mares haha

The Color Out Of Space — Lovecraft

At the Mountains of Maddens — Lovecraft

If you saw the movie, “The Thing” it was based off this book. 

Cheers! 

- X"
68223,"Here are mine - 

* *Foundation* by Asimov - the original trilogy
* *Dune* by Herbert - the first novel
* *2010* by Arthur C Clarke - Chapter 51 is one of my favorite passages in all literature.
* *Seeker* by Jack Mcdevitt - love the twist at the end
* *The Forge of God* by Greg Bear

Close to this list - the first 2 Motie books, Forever War, The Hercules Text, Timeline."
68224,"Most of my favorite sci\-fi at the moment seems to come in series.

So here are my favorite scifi series:

* Vatta's War \- Elizabeth Moon
* Vorkosigan Saga \- Lois McMaster Bujold
* Serrano Legacy \- Elizabeth Moon
* The First Salick War \- Jean Johnson
* Worldwar Series \- Harry Tutledove
* WebMage Series \- Kelly McCullough
* Retrieval Artist Series \- Kristine Katherine Rusch"
68225,"Vorkosigan is my favourite series, I've read Serrano 3 times and will again, I liked Vatta and Worldwar so I have come to the conclusion we have similar tastes.

I am going to try Salick, Webmage, and Retrieval Artist and you might want to try—

My second favourite series is the Leary and Mundy series by David Drake.

Others I like-

Honor Harrington and Starfire and Dahak by David Weber.

Troy Rising by John Ringo

Lost Fleet by Jack Campbell. I love the Lost Stars spinoff, it is on my reread list.

Deathstalker by Simon R Green.

Star Voyager by William Forstchen

Prelude to Dune by Brian Herbert, despite not liking Dune by his father.

Star of the Guardians and Mag-Force by Margaret Weis.

Red Rising by Pierce Brown

I enjoyed the first 6 Kris Longknife by Mike Shepherd books

Brainship and Crystal Singer and Planet Pirates by Anne McCaffrey."
68226,"Yes, I have often thought that recommendations ONLY work when they are paired like ""if you like X you might like Y.""

I do like Honor Harrington, Leary and Lost Fleet and Kris Longknife, so I think our tastes are VERY similar!

I see you liked Deathstalker by Simon R Green. Did you try his Nightside series? I really loved them  


I also see you liked a John Ringo book. Have you tried the series starting with We Few by David Weber and John Ringo? Another favorite of mine."
68227,"The March series (as I call it) **ends** with We Few ;-) and I love it, thoroughly enjoying my reread a few months ago. I have been known to swear with the word, ""pocking"". (It wasn't on the list because I copied and pasted from a space opera post.)

I have followed SRG since Deathstalker came out, liking Nightside and liking Drood even more but Ishmael Jones and Ghostfinders did nothing for me.

I assume you have read the Belisarius series by David Drake and Eric Flint, which is precisely as good as the March series, even if it hasn't got the space age weapons.

On a slightly lower level of quality to March and Belisarius is the General series by David Drake and SM Stirling.

There is the Sparta series by Niven and Pournelle which I enjoyed reading 3 times but unfortunately didn't enjoy the fourth attempt.

You will probably enjoy Julian May's Rampart Worlds series.

I hope you have read the new Vorkosigan novella, the Flowers of Vashnoi that came out 3 weeks ago. I enjoyed it.

You can look at my [goodreads shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41606738-seantheaussie) if you like to see what I like in other genres. 5 stars is reread list. 4 stars is good. 3 stars is read. 2 stars is DNF due to boredom. 1 star is DNF due to dislike.

I am going to bookmark you and will send you a message if I come across any more books that meet our mutual tastes. Please do the same."
68228,"- **Destiny's Road** by Larry Niven: I love the lower stakes, the more personal journey covering the main character's entire life against a sci-fi backdrop.

- **Consider Phlebas** by Iain M. Banks: Made me realize space operatic sci-fi could still be literary and the series influenced my outlook on life.

- **The Quantum Thief** by Hannu Rajaniemi: The first book to really challenge me in a really long time. Really interesting concepts and I love how imaginative he is.

- **Count Zero** by William Gibson: Better characters that Neuromancer and expands on that foundation.

- **Friday** by Robert Heinlein: I remember being so impressed by the book's descriptions of what is essentially Wikipedia in a story written in the early 80s."
68229,"Neuromancer by William Gibson
Snow crash by Neal Stephenson 
The three body problem by cixin lui
Hyperion by Dan Simmons
The handmaids tale by Margeret Atwood


These are books that I could reread every couple of years. I’d like to include Dune by Frank Herbert also."
68230,"Left Hand of Darkness -Ursula Le Guin
Stalker Roadside Piknik - Arkadi and Boris Strugatski
Solaris - Stanislav Lem
A Fire Upon the Deep - Vernor Vinge
Blindsight - Peter Watts

Le Guin is a must read for any sci fi fan. Stalker and Solaris on the other hand are the classics of Soviet/Easter Block sci fi. A Fire Upon the Deep is one of the best space operas ever and Blindsight is one hell of a weird book."
68231,"1. Manta's Gift by Timothy Zahn
2. Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov
3. Nightfall by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg
4. Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card
5. Dune by Frank Herbert"
68232,"It's a very difficult choice, but here's my list:

* Peter F. Hamilton's *Pandora's Star* and *Judas Unchained*. Formally space opera, these novels have everything a sci-fi fan can desire.

* *Hyperion* and *The Fall of Hyperion*, by Dan Simmons. The same as the previous (However, I not enjoyed the irregular *Ilium* Saga by this author).

* *Evolution*, by Stephen Baxter

* *River of Gods*, by Ian McDonald (Actually almost any novel by this author, for example the two published *Moon* novels).

* *Stars my Destination* or *The Demolished Man*, by Alfred Bester.

Special mentions: *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K LeGuin and *The Golden Age* by John C. Wright

Sorry because there are many more novels to mention, especially in the classics"
68233,"Favorites doesn't mean I think this is their best work, but:

*Wild Seed* by Octavia Butler

> This whole series set off a deep change in my worldview. This is the chronologically ""first"" novel of the Patternist series. All of Butler's themes are present and strong here, with a good dose of telepathic powers.

*A Fabulous, Formless Darkness* by Samuel R. Delany

> Conventionally known as *The Einstein Intersection*... and not at all by this poetic title Delany wanted to use. This novel is the instar to Delany's *Dhalgren*. Even hints at his even later novel *Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand* can be seen in this short novel.

*Four Ways to Forgiveness* by Ursula K. Le Guin

> A different, less epic and more affecting visit to a Hainish world. To me, this is Le Guin at her prime in this universe, the dirty and hard work of the rokaner, exposing the brutality of humanity, and showing how even our worst can be overcome. 

*Green Mars* by Kim Stanley Robinson

> The right way to start off a second installment in a trilogy--introduce a new generation (cast) of characters. Mars comes to life, and all the posturing of *Red Mars* comes to a head here. The only weakness of this book is its cliffhanger ending.

*The Fifth Head of Cerberus* by Gene Wolfe 

> Three parts, three perspectives, one planet. Best read after Le Guin's *Planets of Exile and Illusion*, to which Wolfe's novel subtly responds. Brilliant prose of a complex world about which you want to know more and more, but will just have to content yourself by reading closer."
68234,"I’ll have to check out your Le Guin recommendation. I love Left Hand of Darkness and Dispossessed, but know nothing about this one."
68235,"In the new Library of America books, it's listed as *Five Ways to Forgiveness*, so that might help too."
68236,I really hope they release an updated paperback with the fifth story.
68237,"Dhalgren - Samuel R Delany 

Stand on Zanzibar - John Brunner 

Lord of Light - Roger Zelazny 

Dune - Frank Herbert

A Scanner Darkly - PKD

Special mentions to the Strugatsky brothers (Roadside Picnic, Monday starts on Saturday, Hard to be a God), James Morrow (This is the Way the World Ends) and Gene Wolfe (The Book of the New Sun). 

Edit: I've just realised so many books I didn't mention from Reynolds/Banks/Vinge that I'm getting all stroppy trying to narrow it down to 5."
68238,"So hard to pick 5... recently I’ve enjoyed these ones: 
1. Ancillary Justice- Anne Leckie
2. The 3 body problem - Cixin Liu 
3. Flood - Stephen Baxter
4. Wool -Hugh Howey
5. Ilium - Dan Simmons 

Having said that - if you are Looking for recommendations you cant really go wrong reading Asimov, Heinlein, leGuin and Philip K dick"
68239,"Thanks, I have read Wool and I know of Ilium but haven’t read it myself (wife gave me a plot breakdown). Will look into the others. 

I am very familiar with Heinlein, PKD, and Le Guin (Left Hand of Darkness might make my top 10). I know the grandfather Asimov and have read some short stories I believe but never actually read a novel of his. What would be a great novel to start with?"
68240,I read his foundation series first- loved those
68241,"Have always been a fan of anything Clarke, and Asimov's work is wonderful (bigotry aside). Also adore The Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. 

Thought I'd throw out a lesser-known recommendation for something I happened upon by chance and enjoyed enough to own, reread, and pursue the sequel to; Robopocalypse by Daniel H. Wilson. Description in the title really. I liked the interwoven character- and plot-driven story fuelled by decent hard SciFi in a documentary style reminiscent of World War Z without feeling derivative or sacrificing narritive."
68242,"* The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K LeGuin

* Look to Windward by Iain M Banks

* Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie

* The Time Machine by HG Wells

* Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson

* Needs time to settle, but I'm really feeling like recent releases either Autonomous by Annalee Newitz or Only Human by Sylvain Neuvel could take the 5th spot."
68243,"*The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* - Heinlein  
*Rendezvous With Rama* - Clarke  
*Hyperion* - Simmons  
*Dune* - Herbert  
*The Vorkosigan Saga* - Bujold  

I can't really name which book in the Vorkosigan books because I read almost all of them back-to-back and the boundaries between them are fuzzy in my m ind."
68244,"This is probably my current/recent top 5:

* **2312** by Kim Stanley Robinson: rambly, ambitious, and with lots of flowery descriptions of nature, 2312 was the book that got me back into sci-fi big time after a long period of not being able to finish a book.
* **Habitat** by Simon Roy: a short graphic novel about a collapsed civilization in a satellite colony going to war over a single 3D printed laser gun. A must-read for sci-fi fans.
* **Frankenstein** by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein is the most relatable college art student in all of fiction. The first and most famous science fiction novel, yet its still somehow underrated.
* **Draco Tavern** by Larry Niven: Niven is an old favorite who I've sort outgrown, but Draco Tavern is a fun collection where he leans heavily on his greatest strength, writing tons of wacky aliens.
* **The Word for World is Forest** by Ursula Le Guin: Le Guin's post-Vietnam anti-war novella where she invents Ewoks 10 years early and rages against libertarian army bros is just as cathartic and necessary all these years later."
68245,"If you like Habitat, check out the classic Nonstop by Brian Aldiss. The whole time I was reading Habitat I felt like I was visualizing Nonstop."
68246,"Seeing as lots of my other ""top five"" are listed these are some others I'd consider in my ""far more than five"" top five:

1. Excision, Iain M. Banks. 
2. Bitter Seeds, Ian Treggelis
3. Schismatrix, Bruce Sterling.
4. Chasm City, Alastair Reynolds.
5. Glasshouse, Charles Stross."
68247,"-**Eyes of the Overworld** by Jack Vance


-**The Wolves of Memory** by George Alec Effinger


-**Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang** by Kate Wilhelm


-**Behold the Man** by Michael Moorcock


-**The Forever War** by Joe Haldeman



These are in no order, but I highly recommend them all. The Vance one is a book from the *Dying Earth* saga that is my favorite series ever. The Wolves of Memory is like a game of Paranoia RPG that got too serious, super dark book that blew me away and needs to be read by more. Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a unique take on both cloning and the post-apocalypse genre, another that doesn't get enough love. Behold the Man is the king of time travel books in my mind, with the bonus of addressing religion."
68248,"The Dispossessed by Le Guin (my top novel ever, period).

Hyperion by Simmons.

Blindsight by Watts.

Revelation Space by Reynolds.

The Scar by Mieville (kind of spans scifi and fantasy)."
68249,"I'm going to go with series and I'm going to limit them to a specific thematic area. 

* Troy Rising by David Drake, especially the first two. The third book is okay but not as good as the earlier ones.  The series is marred by a lack of a fourth book.   

* Kris Longknife by Mike Shepherd. These are all fairly formulaic, but they are a good formulaic for most part, and they have some excellent bad guys. If you like any of the Honor Harrington series, you will probably like these. Unless you have a fondness for Weber's extended exposition, which does not show up here.   

* Vatta's War by Elizabeth Moon.   

* Gunnery Sergeant Torin Kerr by Tanya Huff.   

* Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell."
68250,"* Various - **The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume I** - This book did more to open my young mind to the possibilities of science fiction than any other ten books. A masterful collection of 26 short stories from 1934-1963, by some authors I knew (and some I didn't). I can't recommend this one enough.
* Douglas Adams - **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** - One of the best comedic novels I've ever read, alongside...
* Connie Willis - **To Say Nothing of the Dog** - Not sure whether I actually laughed out loud more while reading this one or *Hitchhiker's*. I may have to re-read both to put it to the test.
* Walter M. Miller, Jr. - **A Canticle for Leibowitz** - Others have covered this one pretty well.
* David R. Palmer - **Emergence** - The diary of an eleven-year-old genius who lives through a plague, this one has action and characters and problem-solving that just *work* so well for me.

That's five, and I didn't even get to Iain Banks, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Walter Jon Williams, Greg Bear, David Drake...."
68251,"Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion - Dan Simmons - Probably don't really need to explain this one seeing how popular in this thread it seems to be.

Red Mars - Kim Stanley Robinson - I get that KSR and the Mars trilogy aren't for everyone, but I loved it.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the man's politics, but this book really profoundly changed the way I thought about a lot of issue, especially like environmental ethics and conservation.

Jurassic Park - Michael Chrichton - I know Crichton is a little too thriller/pop-lit for this sub, but I unapologetically love this book.  Heavily influenced my career direction in high school.

The Dark Forest - Cixin Liu - The end of this book just gobsmacked me.  Has some rough parts, but the finish is mind-blowing.

Use of Weapons - Iain M. Bainks - I'm maybe less enamored with the Culture novels as a whole, but I loved the structure and twist that that entailed."
68252,"House of Suns, Alastair Reynolds - Epic in scope, mind blowing space opera. We really need a sequel to this one.

The Songs of Distant Earth, Arthur C. Clarke - Sad, hopeful, with elegant and concise prose. Clarke on record saying it's his favorite novel he's written, but it gets little attention.

Seveneves, Neal Stephenson - Epic on scope. Like The Martian but saving the human race, not just one man. People disliked the third act, I loved the whole book.

Gateway, Frederik Pohl - The first true science fiction book I ever read. Mystery, tragedy, with multi-genre elements.

Nova, Samuel R. Delany - Space opera before space opera was a thing."
68253,Love Gateway. Such an unique story.

68267,"1. Jurassic Park - Michael Crichton

This got me into reading. I love this book so much. I know it's not a masterpiece but it's my favorite. 

2. Dune - Frank Herbert

It's such magnificent world he created. Beautiful and so deep and well thought out. 

3. Hyperion  - Dan Simmons

Each story in the book has a different style and substance. 

4. Enders Game - Orson Scott Card

Yup. 

5. Starship Troopers-  Robert Heinlein 

This is what great sci-fi is to me. A sci-fi story told around an amazing social construct and thought process."
68268,"No order:

Dune - an absolute classic, lots of interesting stuff going on here, economics, cultures, history, drugs, ecology. (The first 4 are all brilliant to me).

Player of games - probably my favorite banks sci fi novel, (excession is really good to and use of weapons), interesting story, good world building, good social critique.

The three stigmata of palmer eldritch - every book i have read by pkd has been impressive, this one sticks in my mind as being particularly frightening though, (not knowing what's real etc).

Brave new world - probably a bit dated now but blew my mind when i was younger and made me view the world differently. 

Hyperion - great world that feels very fleshed out and detailed, covers so many different sci fi concepts partly due to its semi short story format, my experience with this was via audiobook which was great.


Special mentions:

1984 - introduced me to the genre and got me interested in reading in general.

The lathe of heaven - like one of pkd's better books and introduced me to taoism.

The shadow of the torturer - only read the 1st part of this four part story, (botns) keen to tackle the rest. Very unique world and writing."
68269,"Without thinking about it too much, other than looking at some other peoples' lists.  

* The City and the Stars - Arthur C. Clarke
* Dune - Frank Herbert
* A Scanner Darkly - Philip K. Dick
* Beyond Apollo - Barry Malzberg
* Blindsight - Peter Watts"
68270,"-Armor by John Steakly: This got me into scifi

-Council Wars by John Ringo: probably the most realistic vision of the future I've ever read

-Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis: one of the best commentaries of current events

-Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson: A masterpiece. This combined with the Ringo books is our future. Also makes me incredibly suspicious of any plans to colonise Mars. 

-The Ringworld books by Larry Niven: I like the idea of being so bored with being old and rich that I go on crazy adventures to alien artifacts.

-Tom Strong by Alan Moore: it's a comic and it's a great treaty on morality and virtue."
68271,"Olaf Stapleton  - starmaker 
Philip k dick - Ubik 
Haldeman - the forever Wars 
Philip k dick - do androids dream of electric sheep"
68272,"* City by Clifford Simak  - pastoral science fiction at its best
* Foundation by Isaac Asimov - Nothing to add. Grand master
* Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny -  Masterpiece, Neil Gaiman has nothing on him
* Excession by Iain M. Banks - just one out of Culture although its all good
* The Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy by Douglas Adams - you can't take everything seriously forever

EDIT: Ctrl+F the thread, no other Simak fans :("
68273,Omg I loves City and have never met anyone who had heard of it!
68274,"* **Hyperion** -  I'm not entirely sure there's something that actually tops Hyperion in terms scale and how good it is. It's covers so much and just as *good*.
 * **Blindsight** - quite well-thought out and just pretty solid all around. My single favorite first contact story in all medium of story teeling. 
 * **The Last Question** by Isaac Asimov - Take the concept of entropy from physics then build an extremely meaningful short story around it. Theb you end up with the single most effective short story i've ever read and in fact i probably like more than alot of books i've read. 
 * **I have no mouth and I must scream** - The level of disturbing it has makes my skin crawl and it makes other depressing/disturbing stuff look like childrens book. Also the title is cool as hell
 * **Brave New World** - It explores a very interesting dystopian/utopian world. What makes this one of my favorites is that the themes it explores is quite disturbingly possibly a path that the evolution of human society will follow. Maybe not to the the same details but the spirit of the concepts can be seen as solutions to some of our issues."
68275,"*The Dispossessed* - Ursula Le Guin.  
*Frankenstein* - Mary Shelley.  
*I, Robot* - Isaac Asimov.  
*The Mote In God's Eye* - Niven and Pournelle."

Hyperion by Dan Simmons   
The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu  
Stories of your life and others by Ted Chiang  
The Scar by China Mieville"
68277,"The Demolished Man , Bester \- fun and interesting adventure with a very dynamic lead character.

Anathem, Stephenson \- Amazing scope \- it's incredible how he manages to hold this together coherently.

The Fountains of Paradise, Clarke \- Beautifully constructed. Clarke was perhaps the greatest at crafting stories.

Tau Zero, Anderson \- Great look at what the psychological effects of extreme time dilation might be.

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Heinlein \- Great story well told."
68278,"Not sure I can whittle it down to five. Here’s a try:

- Dune series (Herbert) - the first four in particular
- Lucifer’s Hammer (Niven and Pournelle) - maybe doesn’t count as sci fi, in which case say Ringworld instead
- Nightfall (Asimov)
- The Cat Who Walks Through Walls (Heinlein)
- Perdido Street Station (Mieville)

So many others!"
68279,Nightfall is a Gem in the Sci\-Fi Cannon.  It's something every Sci Fi fan has to experience at some point.
68280,"I've always loved The Forever War because it's barely about fighting and the time travel is mostly used as a vehicle to discuss huge societal changes. 

&#x200B;

Rendezvous with Rama is going to be referenced by the federal government if an alien object is ever encountered in our solar system. It is so thorough and patient and real. It's not a book I recommend to a lot of people because it's actually kind of dry but I think it is an incredibly realistic look into how we would handle something like that.

&#x200B;

The Stars My Destination is another favorite of mine for societal changes, especially when they discuss the wealthy people and how they showed off. I actually just found that book for 25 cents on campus and read it in a day, I didn't realize it was on that list."
68281,"The Forever War is one of my favourites, too. There's been talk of a film being made of it - I'm not sure how that would play out, but the potential is huge."
68282,"It'd probably be shit, let's be honest."
68283,"Yep, unfortunately you're right."
68284,The absolute shit American conservatives would lose when he comes back and everyone is homosexual might be worth it though.
68285,I remember that as being in the middle. Doesn't the end feature humans reproducing via cloning?
68286,"We are all one, and one is all."
68287,"I love Rendezvous with Rama. It's not just a book about sciencey things like spaceships and robots. It's a book about people actually doing science. The characters aren't being attacked by aliens or trying to save the world. They're just walking around looking at stuff, making measurements, and taking notes. Nobody goes space crazy and tries to push anyone out an airlock. Everyone is reasonable and professional. It's the closest thing to a realistic depiction of a first encounter I've ever read."
68288,I agree the book was great but recommend everyone stay away from the disappointing sequels.
68289,"I read them all a very long time ago, I don’t remember being disappointed by the sequels"
68290,"The sequels are written by a different person. They also have a different focus. The second book is more fantasy than science fiction. It also changes the focus, instead of PVE it's PVP. 

I only read the second and some pages of the third before abandoning them. I hated several things about the book, like how people were more professional on the first book than the second, and (mild spoiler) >!a biologist more worried about dying of hunger than thirst when trapped somewhere!<. The fantasy touches were unexpected and unwanted by me. According to the cover summaries the religious overtones go in crescendo in the following books.

Liking the first does not mean you will like the rest, and viceversa."
68291,The Stars My Destination is a wild trip.
68292,I once saw William Gibson speak and he said the Stars My Destination was his favorite sci-fi novel. I'm inclined to agree or least have it in my personal top ten.
68293,"A Fire Upon the Deep still blows me away every time I read it.  A Deepness in the Sky is very, very solid, but not its equal by any measure.  Children of the Sky left me cold, and I'm not sure why."
68294,"""Fire Upon The Deep"" and ""Deepness In The Sky"" despite being in the same universe / same author are kind of on opposite sites of the space opera spectrum; kind of like ""Ender's Game"" versus ""Speaker for the Dead,"" the first is more action-driven and the second more idea-driven."
68295,"This is totally going off topic, but thank you! I completely forgot about Speaker for the Dead! (I'm not as much of a reader as I used to be, I'm really only here from r/all). I picked it up off my English teachers bookshelf literally having no idea what I was getting in to.  I'd never read Enders Game and this was over a decade ago before the movie.  I loved that book, probably gonna have to dust off the old brain and try reading it again."
68296,I couldn't more highly recommend Ender's Shadow if you're looking to get back into the series. Best book of the Ender or Shadow lines imo
68297,Is it bad I prefer the Shadow Series to the Ender Quartet?
68298,"Nah, the Shadow Series is pretty much a different genre of sci-fi entirely. I definitely prefer Ender's Game to Ender's Shadow, but also definitely prefer the Shadow Series to the Ender Quartet."
68299,I agree about Game vs Shadow. Especially when coming to the end of it for the first time. In the Shadow Series I enjoy seeing the governments interact and how characters view the world stage.
68300,Just finished speaker and xenocide. Good stuff
68302,I much preferred A Deepness in the Sky to A fire Upon the Deep. Maybe because I read it first? >!I was super-invested in Pham after having read **Deepness** and how his story played out in **A Fire Upon the Deep** really bummed me out.!<
68303,"So, I ended up reading A Fire first and A Deepness last and it was incredibly, deeply satisfying."
68304,I found Deepness to be the far superior book myself.
68305,Does the first work as a stand-alone?
68306,"Yeah, Deepness in the Sky definitely works as a stand-alone.  It's really a pleasure to read."
68307,"I think it's worth noting that while A Deepness in the Sky takes place first chronologically, It was released second and I think it should be read second considering the mystery of Pham is important to the narrative of A Fire Upon the Deep."
68308,"A Fire Upon the Deep is on my *tsundoku* shelf, and I'm tempted to read it next. Based on this thread. But I really don't want to know more details about it, to keep it completely novel, hah. I picked it up after AstronomyCast's multiple episode series on more contemporary science fiction they've read and would recommend. [Part One: Space Exploration](http://www.astronomycast.com/2017/12/ep-469-best-modern-sci-fi-for-the-science-lover-part-1-space-exploration/) if anyone is interested. Also highly recommend the podcast itself. 

I *just* finished The Three Body Problem, also per their suggestion.

I have been planning on reading horror next, for ""the season."" Starting with [Uzumaki](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20423941-uzumaki?rating=2&utm_medium=api&utm_source=book_widget)   and then Bradbury's [The October Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_October_Country?wprov=sfla1), but now I'm not sure. Maybe A Fire Upon the Deep will be a good end of November book."
68309,"Really enjoyed both three-body trilogy, and fire upon the deep. Just sayin'.

EDIT: definitely read the full trilogy of three-body tho - unlike a lot of other sci-fi/fantasy epics, the creativity does not peter out at all in the later books. Consistently brilliant throughout."
68310,">  Children of the Sky left me cold, and I'm not sure why.

CotS is pretty much all set up and no payoff. It's not a complete story."
68311,"TIL there's a list of redditors' 200-most-recommended-books. I should explore more worthwhile threads as this one. Thank you, kind stranger."
68312,"r/printSF has a list on GoodReads that's currently at 269 books. I'm about half way through it.

68313,How is that list ordered? Is it just based on the goodreads rating or based on the amount of suggestions from printsf?
68314,Based on users of the list rank their top picks on it.
68315,"Same, looks like I'm going to spend an entire day adding titles to my wish list on goodreads"
68316,"There's already a list on GoodReads from r/printSF.

68317,How did you like Dune?
68319,"Dune Messiah was alright, but not my favorite - but I absolutely loved Children of Dune. I've heard from friends that God Emperor Dune is fantastic, but gets way way out there (which considering this is Dune, it has to be WAY out there) and also jumps thousands of years into the future.  


After those, I've heard it goes downhill."
68320,"I wouldn't say that they 'go downhill' as much as they continue on that 'way out there' path.  There were some seriously cerebral moments/ideas in the following books, that were poorly mirrored in the Son's prequel books, but I still ate them all up."
68321,As a huge Dune nerd. This comment is it.
68322,"While not the case at first,  Heretics and Chapterhouse became my favourites in the series.

The prequels stink. The son is not the father."
68323,"I think they're all great, as long as they are Frank. Stay far, far away from the others.

And God Emperor is one of my favorite books. Didn't like it when I was in high school, but it really clicked with me as an adult."
68325,[Depends who you ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/7j1dzo/about_the_sequels/dr5ahwg?utm_source=reddit-android). :)
68326,"I appreciate the points that you made in that post about where those books come from, but I just can't get past Brian's terrible writing."
68327,I’d say through God Emperor is good. After that it goes off the rails weird.
68328,"If you make it past the first 30 pages of the next book, there's a good chance you'd enjoy the first 6 books of the series."
68329,"The subsequent books are about ideas, not about actions or, unfortunately, people.  I just started ""God Emperor"" and I recall being shocked (in a good way) that it starts with something happening.  Not much happens in Messiah or Children..."
68330,"Read all of Frank's book (the first 6) and burn all of Brian's. Frank Herbert's series was epic. Admittedly, many questions were left unanswered, as he died before he could wrap things up. Brian's works could be used for toilet paper and I still think it'd be a waste. Rarely have I put a book down before finishing it; it took me just a few chapters to determine that whatever story was behind it, it wasn't worth fighting through the writing style that Brian and Kevin J Anderson displayed."
68331,"I read it a very long time ago. I was really impressed with the cultural detail, but have since found other books that I find more impressive in that regard."
68332,Which ones? Asking for a friend.
68333,Top of the list for me is probably LeGuin's *The Left Hand of Darkness*
68334,"> The Left Hand of Darkness

You piqued my interest enough to look into buying the book, only to find its the last in the series. is it a prerequisite to have read the others?"
68335,"It's the first one I read. The only other one I read was *The Dispossessed*. They were only loosely connected, and all sources say as much for the whole series. Same universe, different planet, basically."
68336,much obliged.
68337,"No, the books are all within the same universe but unrelated other than that."
68338,It was alright.
68339,">	u/ProfessorAtreides

🤔"
68340,"Professors are often called ""Doctor"" because they have an advanced degree. The only doctor on the Atreides house, that I know of, is that Traitor. 

u/ProfessorAtriedes is Doctor Yueh, confirmed."
68341,No tears for Yueh.
68342,""" a million deaths were not enough for Yueh"" - a child's history by Princess Irulan"
68343,"If you are on Sci-Fi, I recommend Anathem. It requires a big investment on your part early on, but I felt it was worth it."
68344,"I'm about 100 pages in, and it feels like it's slowly creeping its way out of the scene-setting phase. So far I'm enjoying it a lot more than anything else of Stephenson's that I've read."
68345,It's a hell of a slow burn but damn is it great
68346,"Only about 450 pages to go... just kidding. Probably 600.

Love that book, though."
68347,"My favourite book I've read. I don't even know that I can fully quantify why I love it. I just do.

Definitely is a large investment but the pay off of the world building was worth it (for me) for the last third of the novel. Especially compared to the more anticlimactic pay off of Cryptonomicon (which I also loved). Nearing the end I actually slowed down my reading pace because I didn't want it to finish.

Great characters and great ideas. Been about 5 years since I read it and I still catch myself thinking  about certain aspects of the book or using phrases in my head from time to time. I should read it again..."
68348,Read it years ago and love it.
