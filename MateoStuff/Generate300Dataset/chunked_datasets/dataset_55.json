17592,"Soon^^TM

Edit: joking aside, they're currently running a server rest in Brazil and another country on Android. Wild Rift devs posted a pretty good vid on YouTube if you have the time to check it out. I'm pumped for it as I just got into MLBB and been enjoying learning about LOL and other MOBA lane battlers."
17593,I’m a huge fighting game fan and I’m very excited to see how Riot handles the scene. I definitely think they can make a free to play fighter and set the precedent for it in the scene.
17595,The Battle of Polytopia
17596,Stranger Things: The Game is pretty good and has about 5 hours of gameplay
17597,"Dungeon quest

It’s diablo. And it’s actually fun to play."
17598,Too bad the Devs gave up on it. I LOVE that game.
17599,It looks like it was last updated last week though?
17600,They fix bugs and stuff. Might add set effects every once and a while. But it’s dead. It’s been dead for a long time unfortunately.
17601,"Yeah man. So well put together. You see all these “hack n slash like diablo 2” games and you play em and they’re clunky and shitty. Finally found a game that’s fun and has that loot grind done right, and the devs quit lol"
17602,Eternium?
17603,I never liked it. I don’t know why. Maybe the skill system or the movement.
17604,Same never clicked. Tried a few times before but something is just 'off' about it and it never lived long on my phone.
17605,"I’ll give it a shot, thanks man"
17606,"Here’s the ones that have stayed and gotten played regularly on my phone:

- Mafia Mystery: text based multiplayer game like Town of Salem or Werewolves
- Alchemia Story: MMO JRPG with awesome customization and enough grind to keep you satisfied + multi class on one character 
- Golf Blitz: Multiplayer golf where you can hit other players balls outta the way, some fun avatars and maps all free
- Call of Duty Mobile: Just IMO the most polished shooter so far. PUBG works too if you prefer battle royale 
- Draw Classic: I play back and forth with my fiancé and it’s just cute to send drawings over

I hear Polytopia is good, but it also requires you to buy something in order to unlock multiplayer. SuperFowlst 2 is downloaded and nice if you like arcade type games."
17607,Mafia mystery and golf blitz sound great. I’m gonna check em out
17608,"Enjoy man! Mafia is a chat game so don’t take it too seriously, some people can get worked up but it’s really chill if you don’t stress it. 

Great choice with Golf Blitz too! Don’t forget you can join a Team with your friends for some friend trolling! 

Ask if you’re confused about either game and I’m glad to help."
17609,Call of Duty Mobile has a battle Royale mode with it as well! It’s just a good FPS. Very FTP.
17610,"Agreed. PUBG has a slightly better Battle Royale IMO, but that’s just preference. I don’t have it on my phone anymore because the matches in any BR go too long for my free time. Both are good and have their own flavor though for sure."
17611,"Archero. 

I put alooooooot of hours into that game and didn’t spend a time. It gets challenging, but not too challenging where it’s not fun. It takes skill and you always feel like you can beat the stage with practice and when you do it’s very rewarding."
17612,Sky children of the light deserves at least one playtrough. Most beautiful game on IOS
17613,"Tetris Royale, Gwent, Crossy Road, Crazy Taxi, Solitaire?"
17614,"Dang, your comment gave me hope, but Tetris Royale still isn’t out in the US."
17615,Either make a new Apple ID with the country that it’s in or temporarily change your Apple ID country
17616,Which countries have it?
17617,"New Zealand does, and they have a tournament each day with a prize pool. They do say that you have to be in New Zealand to claim a prize through paypal if you win though."
17619,"Frotz: An essentially unlimited amount of text based adventuring. It comes with a bunch preinstalled, but you can add thousands more games to it for free from the included Free, no ads, no iAP.

Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection: Not the prettiest game out there, but it features a whole bunch of variety, tons of puzzles, and it’s under 4 megabytes. Free, no ads, no iAP.

Pathos: An iOS adaptation of Nethack. Free, no ads, no iAP.

Star Realms: Probably the best digital board game adaptation ever made. It’s a deckbuilder (think Dominion, not Magic: The Gathering), and it’s excellent. The demo will give you a ton of playtime, as it will let you play the base game against the easy and medium bots. A $5 USD iAP unlocks local/online multiplayer/hard bot, and it’s absolutely worth it. Free, no ads, lots of single time (gameplay expanding) iAP, some cosmetic repeat-able iAP.

Epic Card Game: I’m already getting my card game fix from Star Realms, but this MTG draft-ish game is made by the same people as Star Realms. Apparently online play is free in this one, but I haven’t really played it.
Free, no ads (afaik), repeat-able iAP (I have no idea how egregious it is)

Armello: I have 110 hours in the PC version, and the mobile port is just as good. It’s a digital board game (with no physical version?), and it’s totally worth trying. Free, no ads, single time and repeat-able iAP (cosmetic and gameplay expanding).

Fowlst: Action game, like a combat-focused Flappy Bird. It’s sequels have ads/iAP, but the original is completely free. Free, no ads, no iAP."
17620,"These are awesome, thanks!"
17621,"[Skiing Yeti Mountain](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skiing-yeti-mountain/id960161732?mt=8) - one-finger, portrait arcade. Ski down a slope while avoiding obstacles and beat the time. It gets more difficult to get gold medals around Lv200. Has over 800 levels. Has endless mode. $3 to remove ads.

[Vainglory](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vainglory/id671464704) - 3v3 and 5v5. It’s kinda dead, but still the best looking mobile MOBA out there."
17622,"Hell yea Vainglory. The developers stopped updating and creating new heros, but the game is still running. They’re hoping to put everything in the hands of the community, while keeping the same gameplay experience. A great MOBA for IOS, and imo, the best one"
17623,"When the dust settled, it might not even be free to play at all anymore. Pay servers to play."
17624,"That is a reasonable possibility, but as of now, SEMC devs are trying to keep it free for everyone."
17625,"Wait for LoL mobile to come out, everybody is going to play that"
17627,I play COD and Brawl Stars and they set it up so it’s not really Pay to Win. Fair games lots of free loot boxes. Good fun all around. More so BS than COD.
17628,"Love having COD on mobile! While not next-gen level graphics, they’re damn close, and the game-play, maps, and game-types keep the addiction level HIGH. My Xbox One X is getting zero love lately."
17629,"If you are into niche games and visual novels, Everlasting Summer is a great free game to spend 20~25 hours with. It’s freeware and to fully understand the story you have to unlock all 13 endings."
17630,"I played this on steam, didn’t know it was on mobile! It’s a good one!"
17631,**Datawing** is beautiful and short.
17632,World of tank blitz
17633,"Its good but to get to the higher tiers, it is quite pay to win but you can work around the f2p part but it does need more patience. If anyone wishes for me to elaborate, I'll gladly do it"
17634,I stopped paying a year back. I am having a blast.
17635,"Oh yeah same, the last i bought was a type 62 bundle and since i really wanted it no regrets and i’ve never felt like spending ever since. There are workarounds the f2p part and as much as i shit on the game, the grinding for me is actually balanced. Not too long to feel grindy"
17636,I think I got about 100 ads for this game but never tried it. Now I have to find out for myself. First time I heard anyone bring it up. Thanks!
17637,Dissidia final fantasy opera Omnia.  It’s a gatcha roleplaying game focused on team building. If you like final fantasy it’s even better but even without it the battle mechanics are solid and the resources are plentiful overall.
17638,And its free to play friendly
17639,Yep considering the premium currency I’ve bought I haven’t spent and did just to support the game
17640,Dragalia lost. One of the most generous and well-made gacha games with rpg playstyle.
17641,This game has been my daily driver far longer than any other game and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. Love the direction they’re heading with it.
17642,"I played for a month or so but fell off. It was super polished but the controls didn’t feel very responsive and the content felt very limited/repetitive. 

I’m curious if much has changed, or has it just been more similar content?"
17643,Not changed per se but streamlined. You can try again especially since it’s currently on a more generous banner for summons with higher rates.
17644,"Truthfully they have still been doing mostly raid and facility events. But they have added defensive battles and this month we will get a new mode called onslaught (solo wave based event). The new end game bosses have been very enjoyable. Less scripted OHKO moves, more reactable and forgiving mechanics with a wider range of acceptable character pool usage. 

But truthfully if you hated the controls not much has changed on that front. Rolls have invincibility frames now and some of the basic attack strings changed but that’s about it."
17645,Very much appreciate the info!
17646,"great game. i played maybe a month tops, the reason i left is because i couldnt get ieyasu and even though i got to mid game boss fights that were fun, gems were slowing down and im a completionist type that doesnt like to grind. really though i had 90% of the characters very fast its worth playing"
17647,"Black Desert, Ark, and Sky are amazing on iPad mini at least."
17648,"[Another Eden](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/another-eden/id1439565347), a super fun F2P JRPG."
17649,"My two favorite completely free time killers

17650,Phoenix 2
17651,Yes ! I recommend it 100%
17652,In my opinion I think it’s a crime Soul Knight doesn’t get more love.
17653,I would go with asphalt 9. Really good for what it gives
17654,"I’ve been having a lot of fun with games that have controller support, Minecraft, Dead Cells, Fortnite

It helps that the two of those multiplayer options are cross platform too, I played fortnite with my buddies who were on PS4 and it worked great.

CoD mobile is fun, it’s a solid arcade shooter experience I’d expect from the title, without the 200 something gb, it’s great to be able to chill on the couch and jump in for a quick round of multiplayer, zombies or br. Idc if it’s bots or players, I’m super casual and it’s just fun to shoot stuff.

I haven’t seen much about them on IOS but I played a lot of Kotor and Baldurs Gate II back n the day and I may pick them up soon, I think they’d be worth it if they’re solid ports and you’re into rpgs.

I’m also considering picking up GTA SA for the mindless fun factor, had lots of fun with that growing up and I could see it being really fun."
17655,I recommend GTA SA especially if you have a controller. It just transforms the experience even more and i have like 200 hours on mobile (3 different save files) but the moment i got a controller holy shit I can't go back
17656,Zombies got removed on cod mobile tho 🤨
17657,"Oh my god I just launched the game to take a screenshot of my menu to show you it was there but it’s GONE. I hadn’t played for a bit and just relaunched the game earlier today and I saw it, so I guess the option must have just been there while the client was downloading updates, that’s a bummer. :( 

Still arcade fun minus the zombies I suppose, to be honest nothing really grabbed me except the original maps and to that end I may redownload the BOIII Zombies and play through it with my brother and relive that nostalgia if I feel the itch.

Not really the same but I played a lot of Dead Trigger some years back, I downloaded the second one but haven’t played it, I may get into it as a zombie blasting alternative, also controller supported iirc."
17658,https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/soul-knight/id1184159988 you don't need to pay a dime to play it and enyoj fully. An amazing game!
17659,Its basically enter the gungeon but with its own spin.
17660,"Hades Star.

Build a star base. Collect hydrogen to power ships to ship cargo for credits to buy upgrades. PvE, solo PvP, and large team PvP."
17661,I remember trying it a while back. It seemed like another one of those clash of clans reskins but in space. Should I try it again with a more open mind?
17662,"Responsive dev, no ads, no requests for $$ support, big community, not P2W. A bit of a grind but some people really enjoy grinding for something. It may just be that it’s not for everyone but I can’t think of another game where I’ve felt impelled to donate to support rather than paying to remain relevant."
17663,I gave it another try. It really does seem grindy but I like the artstyle and theme. The only issue I have is that I have to be online and constantly focusing on the game to get credits. Does that change a bit later in the game?
17664,"I think you ultimately get out of the game what you put into it... there are a few recent additions that allow you to passively collect your credits, but at a much lower rate than if you were active about it."
17665,"Brawl Stars is super fun and super polished and avoids the trappings of F2P games- with this game you are looking forward to the gameplay rather than dailies / premium currency / etc. There really aren't those cheap flashy visuals and pop-ups to create a dopamine rush, just very well done modeling and comic book style artwork. You can easily get a character up to 500 trophies, which is considered the beginning of the meta for them, at their base power (you can increase their power over time through loot boxes.) It's surprisingly f2p friendly, you can easily rank high without spending anything. This comes from a 2 year + player."
17666,"Such a great thread with little gems I didn’t know yet. 
Thanks for all the suggestions !

May I add a few games I like a lot :
- soosiz (plateform a little like Mario galaxy in 2D)
- swordigo ( action rpg in 2D )
- marathon trilogy (classic FPS)
- the butterfly dreams (puzzles)
- tiny world (mini civilization like with only buildings)"
17667,Titan Conquest is really neat.
17668,I’m really enjoying Random dice. It’s a tower defense game with PvP and PvE. Clans are coming within the next week too! Great time to start playing.
17669,"Sky: Children of the Light! Beautiful game, great community, something children and adults will enjoy. There are in-app purchases, but they aren’t necessary. Plenty of things to do. Made by the same people that made Journey (also recommend, but not free) and Flower."
17670,"👉Gwent 👈

Hands down, one of my favorite truly-free IOS games. It’s a card game (think Hearthstone), but I like the gameplay a LOT more in all honesty."
17672,"Bro, just cuz it says FREE doesn’t mean it won’t cost you. That game is practically P2W if you’re not willing to grind like crazy."
17673,No need to grind like crazy...just play the game and enjoy.
17675,"It’s fairly generous too, if you’re skilled you can earn lots of free cards/chests/gems from tournaments."
17676,"It’s not P2W. Sure, there’s an incentive to pay but you can easily max out cards without spending any money. I guess the meta changes and that’s tough to keep up with as F2P but not at all impossible, especially if you build a deck that’s unlikely to be too affected by changes in the meta."
17677,"you don't have to spend a cent - 3+ years every day for me, one  of the best games I've ever played"
17678,"chef town, evermerge, alchemiastory, june's journey, all the final fantasy games, especially mobius, record keeper, and brave exvius. i also like war of the visions, disney arena, obey me! otome, mystic messenger, moecanchange, some of the majhong games are fun if they have a story with them like mahjong journey or city tours, i like the secret society , mystery society, hidden city, jewels of the wild west, paranormal society, there are really an endless amount of free ios games that you can try. i also recommend getting a mudclient and playing MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games on your phone."
17679,Legends of Runeterra if you’re into CCG’s. The game is very very generous with cards and rewards.
17680,Shop Titans
17681,"Fun game, but they really push the iaps."
17682,"I played it for months, then you run into paywalls and you can only unlock certain type of items after you pay (a lot). It slows progression and a few challenges cannot be completed."
17683,Pubg Mobile
17684,"Got crabs? No? Check out King of Crabs, if you’re down with a little crab-on-crab violence. It’s a wonky distraction. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/king-of-crabs/id1354478141"
17685,castle ramble is a good one. simple gameplay with controller support
17686,Untold is free till a certain point in the story but it’s an awesome game.
17687,"Time Locker is one of my favorites. It is a simple endless runner game with a truly unique premise. The character you play as shoots projectiles out in front of them. The enemies move quickly across the screen, bump into any one of them and you lose. However, there’s a twist: If you stop moving, the enemies freeze as well. The hectic speed becomes carful bursts of motion, strategy. There is a line that slowly peruses the character to prevent you from stalling.

It’s a fantastic game, with purchases only for powerups/OP characters that aren’t needed to enjoy the single player, endless runner experience."
17688,Calm down this isn’t a sponsored add
17689,"I can recommend you Dicast if you like pvp, free to play, boardgames. 
Great Experience for me

17690,Brawlstars. Start playing since 2018. Still plays it everyday today.
17691,"Mahjong Soul... I've been playing a really long time, but i think that it can be played just absolutely free... or at least you can play with friends or bots for free which helps you collect coins to use to play (and win more) in ranked games."
17692,Gwent.

17699,"Honkai Impact 3rd has awesome graphics and gameplay and combat system, if you like anime style RPG is a very good game."
17700,I hate that I love it... I don't spend any money on it but I play Gardenscapes before bed maybe twice a week or more.
17701,"Clash of Clans is the only online strategy game that isn't pay to win, at least compared to things like Lords Mobile, Rise of Kingdoms and so on. I'm not sure why people believe the opposite: you can only pay to speed up your buildings, but when you do you get paired with opponents of your same power level, so there isn't really an advantage."
17702,MLBB!

17732,"I’m surprised that everyone is saying Khloe who has bullied girls younger than her, e.g., Chloe Grace Mortez and Jordyn Woods as well as being Kim’s lackey and bullying Kourtney for not being comfortable sharing aspects of her life. Bare in mind it’s arguable that Kourtney has shared the most out of all of them.

Khloe uses the persona of KhloMoney and people find her relatable that way as well as because she was the ‘fat’ ‘ugly’ sister but really that doesn’t excuse her behaviour or the way she treats other women.

She is quite misogynistic to women especially those she seems threatened by and simps for men especially traschan so I honestly don’t see how she is the most moral.

Even in the earlier seasons people found her attitudes refreshing but I think that it just showed how negative she really was.

Also this is the same Khloe that said in later seasons that she faked her fertility issues when she was with Lamar as she didn’t want to have kids. Not exactly moral"
17733,"I'm also surprised that people are picking Khloe, cz she's literally such a disgusting person. My opinion of her changed after the whole Jordyn saga. Even tho people on here say but Khloe had every right to feel the way she felt. What right does she have to call women bitches that needs to stop fxcking their men. She's the worst of them all."
17734,"Exactly. Like she is supposed to be Ms Body Positive and had the revenge body tv show which was catered at helping people feel good about their weight but decided to call Jordyn Fat on KUWTK. 

The thing that pisses me off the most about that is she’s a producer, they would have looked at all the footage and even if she had said that in a moment of anger she could have opted for it to be cut. Leaving it in really shows her personality and the way she treats others.

It’s like her playing the victim and showing how ‘upset’ she was after the backlash she received from Twitter about her actions. She genuinely in her warped mind thought that referring to women as bitches and saying they have to stay away from her man and calling Jordyn fat would have got her lots of support. 

If you can’t tell she’s my least favourite KarJenner 😂"
17735,"She called jordyn and Tristan ‘fat fucking liars’ I don’t think she seriously thinks her million foot ex with a ripped body is fat, it was in context."
17736,"Internalized misogyny
I mean yeah Jordyn was friend of her sister but again, go after your man lmao
I went through internalized misogyny and its not a good thing to own"
17738,"There’s a different between being angry and leading a bullying hate campaign. When Khloe’s little sister (Kylie) has to call her off and tell her and Kim they’re going too far that shows how her actions are deplorable. I’d get maybe a couple of indirects/directs towards the situation and venting a bit but they went on and on with it until Kylie intervened, this shows that it went beyond the original anger as became much more mean.I didn’t call her evil, I’m saying that in terms of morality I don’t understand why people says she’s the most moral because her actions say otherwise. Why do all of that to someone even if they did hurt you, it doesn’t set a good example for her daughter. 

And what about with CGM that isn’t understandable and same with Kourtney. They were actions and situations where she chose to behave in certain ways and didn’t care about the effect and impact it would have on them.

Morality is literally defined as being concerned with principles of right and wrong behaviour and holding/manifesting high principles of proper conduct. I’m not bashing her or saying she’s the worst person in the world I’m just saying when it comes to morality she doesn’t fit that and I don’t get why people think she’s the most moral"
17739,Yeah because everyone in the family sucks and Khloe sucks the least
17740,Lol what?she is the most evil one
17741,none of them
17742,LOL. This is a totally valid answer!
17743,the one getting people off death row
17744,Wdym? Do you mean when kaitlyn caused that car accident?
17745,"I’m confused as to why people are saying Kim. She stole $125,000 off her best friend, promoted appetite suppressing lolly pops, diarrhoea teas, and waist trainers to her young audience even though they’re dangerous products, feeds news stories to the press about her mentally ill husband, participated in bullying Jordyn woods, makes nasty comments to her sisters about their appearances, planned that god awful island party during the middle of the pandemic, openly has a favourite child and traded her children’s privacy for relevance. I guess her lawyer shtick has been a hell of a rebrand"
17746,"She stole $125,000 off her best friend?! What happened??"
17747,Don’t forget helping recruit people into a pyramid scheme!
17748,"I think Kim. People who have worked with her always say how nice and respectful she is. Plus I think once she reached her 30s (especially after the Paris robbery) she's started thinking more about her life and legacy. The fact that she's so invested in becoming a lawyer and helping to abolish the death penalty and has started to really open her mind to thinking about other people besides the rich and famous shows that she's decent. I think Kim and her family all have moments when they are out of touch with the average person, but I get the sense that Kim is still in touch with humanity despite it all. Even when she messes up, I feel like her intention is always to do the right thing."
17749,Love your perspective! She has definitely grown as a person over the years.
17750,"hey, happy cake day! 🎂"
17751,"Ahh, thank you so much!!"
17752,"Khloe has a lot of issues but I would say it’s her. I think she knows how to respect people, from all walks of life. I think she comes off a lot less classist than Kim and Kourtney do & she empathises better than the rest of them. 

A lot of her character flaws don’t come from a moral aspect imo, more of a lack of self love. She doesn’t get it right all the time of course, but who does?"
17753,She tweeted a pic of Chloe moretz asshole online? I think that was irresponsible Chloe was like only 19 at the time.
17754,".... wait say what, now?"
17755,Irresponsible? That was downright nasty and spiteful. There is no defence for that one.
17756,"that was really fucked up and childish, but to be fair it was indeed in retaliation to Chloe slut shaming. Chloe Moritz has a long history of being very weird and misogynistic and slut shamey so its understandable that Khloe would share that as being hypocritical."
17757,Khloe still shouldn’t have done that imo
17758,A lot of people shouldn’t have done a lot of things but I agree Khloe is the best answer
17759,"It wasn't even Chloe M's asshole, just a random person who looked like Chloe M, whose picture Khloe used to slut shame Chloe M."
17760,Still the damage was done
17761,"Oh don't get me wrong I'm not defending Khloe, but just the thought that she went to search up nudes of a teen as away to slut shame them."
17762,That doesn’t mean you should tweet a pic like that though. Khloe should’ve put her down with words lol
17763,"Chloe Moretz was deff not slut shaming Khloe when Khloe did that, all she said was stop wasting your voice on something so unimportant (referring to the kanye, taylor fued) and that people in the industry needed to get there heads out of a hole and realize what was actually happening in the real world. Nowhere there did she slut shame anyone, Khloe retaliated dirty as she always does."
17764,"I’m pretty sure it was because Chloe insulted Kim for posting her nude bathroom pic and then Kim also replied and said something like “let’s welcome Chloe moretz to the party, I loved your (some sort of risqué mag cover she recently did) boo”. I don’t think it had anything to do with the Taylor and Kanye situation."
17765,"Maybe you're mistaking two different situations, but for sure the butthole picture was due to Kanye and Taylor's fued. Had absolutely nothing to do with slut shaming.

17766,"Yeah, it was 2 different situations! This is what I was talking about 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/ew.com/article/2016/03/15/chloe-grace-moretz-kim-kardashian-twitter-feud/%3famp=true"
17767,"Okay and that's fine, but again when Khloe posted that other picture there was no slut shaming involved and Khloe did it simply to be a bullly. She has real mean girl tendencies whether we like to admit it or not. 🥴"
17768,"You didn’t need to tell me again 🤣 I didn’t argue with you. I literally said, yeah, it was 2 different situations."

17771,I definitely read that sentence wrong at first...
17772,Totally agree.
17773,"I would say: 

Khloe

Kim 

Kendall 

Kylie 

Kourtney 

Kris

I feel like Kim is probably more moral these days, but Khloe has been consistently before and after fame. She has her own set of issues forsure, but I get the sense that Khloe is a lot less elitist and judgmental than the rest of her family. She seems to have a lot of empathy and also seems to be the most likely to just be laid back and able to kick it with whomever. I get that sense from Kendall too, that she’s not as snobby as she comes off, and that she can kick it and have a good time without needing all the bells and whistles. 

Kim has come a long way these last 15 years. She’s always carried herself with grace and a strong sense of professionalism and politeness, but she had always been pretty self-centered until she started her philanthropic pursuits. I see Kylie as somewhere in the middle, she seems down to Earth and empathetic sometimes, but then so out of touch at the same time. 

Kourtney and Kris are the worst IMO, but for completely different reasons. Kourt is a brat who thinks she deserves to be treated better than others and looks down upon those less fortunate, Kris’ corruption is more on a person-to-person basis and affects her interpersonal relationships, it’s less about her views on the outside world."
17774,Kris and Kourtney before Kylie?? Australia bush fires springs to mind.
17775,Will you enlighten me?
17776,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/australia-wildfires-kylie-jenner-donate-mink-slippers-instagram-a9274616.html
17777,"I think people think kourtney is more down to earth and smart than she is because she looks the most natural. she has good aesthetic taste but she's the most superficial of all of them. in the same vein I think Kim gets judged as a ""bimbo"" unfairly because of the way she looks. people really hate on the ""diva"" thing.

I remember an snl sketch that called kourtney the ""smart"" one and thinking thats what you would assume if you hadn't watched the show. Kim is very very intelligent but people see her as an airhead."
17778,"You're exactly right-- that Kim gets misconstrued in a negative, bimbo light while Kourtney gets misconstrued in a positive, down-to-earth light. 

It's possible that SNL (and Kourt herself) perceive her as the ""smart"" one because she's a college graduate, but a degree has zero measure of intelligence, especially emotional intelligence, where she lacks the most. 

I love Kourtney, but sometimes her unbelievably petty, self-centered, holier-than-thou attitude is bewildering and honestly shocking and really hard to digest. It's shocking that she could be in the limelight for this long and still not develop an ounce of humility."
17779,"I mean personally Kourtney has never done anything unmoral in my opinion, i mean she is the only sister who isn't always being accused of stealing someone else's man. Kim, Khloe, Kylie and even Kendall have all been. She is also the one who remains the most lowkey when it comes to the family bullying someone, hence why she isn't on blac chyna's lawsuit. She also was the first one to tell all the girls to leave Rob alone and let him be happy with his engagement. Also the one who doesen't do culture appropiation. Sure Kourtney has her faults, but to say she's the least moral is a bit of a reach. 🥴"
17780,Literally this! Kourtney can be annoying or superficial but she’s never done anything wildly controversial.
17781,"This is such an interesting perspective. I hadn't considered that despite Kourtney's bad attitude, she hasn't really been in any scandals..."
17782,Yeah I agree.
17783,"Even though she’s not my favorite, I think it’s Khloe. She’s experienced an immense amount of pain and bullying throughout her life, and while I don’t think the other Kardashian girls haven’t had difficulties throughout their lives, I think Khloe is the *most* relatable to the average human being. I know that doesn’t automatically make her upstanding and ethical but I think she can empathize more with and might try to understand and treat others with dignity and respect maybe a tad better than the others."
17784,"Worst to best IMO if we’re basing it on your description: Kourtney (worst hands down), Kylie (young and really only cares about herself), Kendall (just a bitch to simply put it), Kim (has grown on me so much throughout the show), Khloe (most relatable/understanding)."
17785,Completely agree with your assessment.
17786,This makes sense
17787,"I agree that it's Khloe! I find Khloe annoying, but out of all of them, she's the one I have the most respect for. She seems to me to be the most supportive and empathetic."
17788,"I don't really like rating or judging people (who am I to judge lol)  but my list  from the most moral to worst is: 

Khloe 
Kim
Kourtney 
Kendall 
Kylie 
Kris"
17789,I would put Kourtney after Kylie. She completely lacks empathy yet demands it from others. She lacks self awareness and is very judgmental.
17790,"There’s no way you have Kourtney that high up. She’s the absolute worst, I need an explanation😆"
17791,"I can acknowledge that Kourt has her problems as they all do, but what exactly makes her stand out as the worst? She’s not even first on their list."
17792,Haha I think that I'm biased because Kourtney is my favorite sister 😹🙈
17793,I agree with your lineup but I'd shift Kris a little further up
17794,"Yeah, I almost forgot to add her on the list.. 😅 I really don't know where to place her."
17795,"Yah that’s a tough one actually, if I had to pick I’d put her between Kim and Kourtney but that’s just my personal opinion"
17796,Kim or Khloe
17797,"Khloe, Kim, Kris, Kendall, Kourtney, Kylie"
17798,Khloe & Kim
17799,"Khloe, Kim, Kylie, Kourtney, Kendall, Kris."
17800,"None of them but if there was a gun to my head
I would choose Kylie, even considering the most recent gofundme scandal. That’s how bad I think the others are lol"
17801,Khloe and Kylie I know people hate Kylie but I don’t even know why??? For being traumatised?? She comes across as just living in a bubble but to be fair I think Kylie is so uniquely traumatised by her life experiences that she couldn’t relate to anyone else in the world. She seems sweet enough and mostly just stays in her own lane and drops sexy selfies on her Instagram
17802,"I mean, Khloe has gone through shit yet she seems somewhat empathetic. 

People don’t see Kylie as traumatised. They see her as someone who is very out of touch (e.g mink slippers) and never seems happy and extremely co-dependent. If she hates the fame she could easily move away and stay low-key (see: Blake Lively, Eva Mendez for example), but she likes the $$$ and she’s never had a “normal” life so it’s not that simple for her."

17805,"From best to worst: Kim/Kris (they seem to be the most working-hard oriented, and less entitled), Khloe, kourtney, and kendall/kylie at the bottom."
17806,"This interesting because I think it depends on the category. When it comes to communicating with staff, servers, workers etc I’d say Khloe is the best, the worst is Kourtney or Kendall. When it comes to standing up for women or spewing misogyny, Khloe and Rob are the worst. Kim is generally better about social issues but that’s only because the rest of them are beyond trash. Kourtney is just best at staying out the way which is a morality in some kind of way. Truly, they are all horrible people tho so I can’t even rank it."
17807,"I made this post thinking that it was 100% Khloe, but everyone has brought up really good points! You're right that it depends on the category.

Khloe may seem the most empathetic, but she's also the quickest to lash out. She definitely has anger issues and seems to have this tendency to tear people down when she feels insecure. Kourtney sort of minds her own business but is also the most self-serving IMO. She doesn't really care about other people, and I think the biggest character flaw someone can have is being selfish. Kendall also seems self-centered to me but more in an arrogant way. She really thinks she's the best thing to walk to the earth and is publicly known for being rude and ungrateful. Kim used to be just as egocentric as Kourt and Kendall, but I think she's been humbled over the past few years. Kim has definitely grown a lot as a person, but I still don't think she's very honest. She seems like a snake - I don't really trust what she says. Kourt and Khloe have their faults, but I do think they're honest and I respect that. Kylie is a bit of a mystery to me. She seems, from the outside looking in, to be a sweet-natured girl. But she reminds me of Kim in a lot of ways... especially in not being transparent. Kylie seems to put up this facade, so I don't think anyone really knows who she is. Lastly, you have Kris... who in my opinion is the scum at the bottom of the barrel. Enough said."
17808,I agree with everything you said! Kylie is a mystery - she seems to be a good friend but in some instances she doesn’t lol.
17809,"And to an extent, I understand why she drops friends sometimes. Like it makes sense to me because being being the youngest of the family and watching all your siblings get screwed over and taken advantage of, she's probably very guarded and cautious. I think this is also why she's so mysterious... she's watched her family get into scandal after scandal - I'm sure she's scared."
17812,"Idk, i like Kourtney the most
I feel like even tho Khloe helps people to loose weight and helped that homeless guy,she seems really evil, next to her Kim then Kendall,then Kylie
But in general, its all fault of their mother,i dont like how they awarded Kaitlyn for being trans when she didnt live not even half of her life as such...
I dont like how they seem to spoil their kids, how they want mixed children, how they profit off black culture & they kinda lie to people to earn money and scam real workers who deserve way more money
Also lying about plastic surgeries
Ofc no one is perfect and its our fault that we give them attention, no one deserves to be homeless but again... yeah, ""a lot of people would do what they did, they used their chance"" but again, it just pisses me off a lot"
17813,"KOURTNEY--chill, mom, not as concerned with fame as her sisters...the secret badass of the show and the coolest sister (unpopular opinion, i kno)

Cory--chills in the background while Kris treats him like shit

Kylie--Probably the most ""interesting to look at"", winning the game of life rn...however i somehow feel like she's under too much pressure.

Kim--Kim is becoming kind of a dork to me...But I like that? She's surprisingly human

Khloe--hung Rob out to dry and continues to...she looks like a meme?  ALSO--conspiracy theory that Kylie's style has been heavily influenced by Khloe's...I feel like its subtle?But they were close... she deserves more credit IMO? 

Rob--tragic...watched an earlier episode where Rob cries during family therapy and says ""I feel like my dad would have understood me""

Kendall--i feel like she thinks she's cooler than she is?

 Honorable mention: blac chyna...almost blac Kardashian!!!!!!! COME ON. That is epic"
17814,"lmaoooo blac Kardashian 

I thank Jesus that rob caught on before it got that far.

also I just watched that episode too, I've been rewatching seasons 10-14 and its so sad seeing rob struggling. him crying at the doctors office because he didn't want to take his shirt off and then later on at therapy because his family was not listening to him...it truly breaks my heart.

However, if anything tho I think that will make him a great father, that he will be all about hearing his daughter out and making sure she is heard and that she knows her emotions are valid, especially if he continues with his therapy."
17815,i actually love blac chyna...i want her to win this thing
17816,"1.	Kris- no explanation necessary 
2.	Khloe- she’s always been my favorite and after watching the way she gracefully dealt with the Lamar situation, I’ll probably always like her the most. 
3.	Kourtney- she’s boring but I kind of like that. I like her more when she’s back and forth with Scott though
4.	Kanye- can I count him in? Because I like him a smidge more than Kimberly...
5.	Kim- eh, she’s there
6.	The others- don’t really care for the other three 🤷🏻‍♀️"
17817,yesssss Kanye is genuinely himself and kim...like I said..seems lost in her brand and not as genuine sometimes and can be a little annoying. Kanye...ugh I will love him till the day I die
17818,"What? Where are the Kim stans, I'm actually surprised

Starting with the best:

Kim -- motherhood for sure changed her for the better. She is my fav now. I think having kids made her a lot less selfish. She paid for a team of some of the best attorneys (Who all charge a pretty penny per hour, im sure!!) and used her platform to free a woman from prison, which is actually amazing. She actually got the president to pardon someone. I appreicate how she tries to use her huge social media following for social justice. She is very honest, she interviews well, she is very devoted to Kanye and her kids, and she gets shit done.

Khloe -- the funniest. I love how she interacts with her fans regularly, on Twitter and on her Instagram comments. She used to get so much criticism for being the ""ugliest"" sister, but she just takes it into stride. Yes, she is going a lil crazy w the ass injections -- but can anyone really blame her after always being compared to Kim & kourt, who def are more conventionally attractive? She was the first one to take working out seriously, too.

Kris -- the matriarch. She also gets shit done. And while she can be selfish at times, I do think she loves all of her kids deeply and taught them how to work hard and go after your goals. Respect.

Kourtney -- I appreciate how chill Kourt is, but she is definitely the dumbest out of the 3. She reminds me of suburban moms who are anti-vax cuz they think vaccines cause autism. Like she turns off her Wi-Fi ""cuz of the radiation""... Wifi is NOT radiation in any way, it cannot cause cancer, please do not spread misinformation like that on your show! I feel like she is the most judgmental too, looking down on her sisters for not eating ""healthy"" like she does, or for not being as great of a mom as she is (Which is highly debatable). 

Kylie & Kendall -- I'm meh about both of them... they are just too out of touch w reality and aren't on the show enough for me to really form an opinion."
17819,lmfaooooo the Kourtney one is SPOT ON
17820,😂WiFi devices do have radiation. It’s a fact
17821,"Kris - Smart, practical, sometimes cringey. 

Khloe - Gorgeous, probably the smartest of sisters. 

Kim - Practical and very controlling sbout showing emotions. I think that it's interesting how high her anxiety is. One would say she's the most confident, but nope. You seldom know what she really feels. 

Kourtney - confident, hate her bio diet lifestyle now because I believe that this particular diet is bulshit. She's the least smart of three Kardashian sisters even though she has a degree. Also no ambitions and lack of discipline. BUT she can be the biggest train wreck which is fun to watch. She and Khloe can throw funny tantrums. 

Kendall - She doesn't care about the show, I think that she's the least charming, interesting and is not cut for reality show - her persona isn't very noticable. BUT you don't need that in modeling and she's pretty, probably kinda smart. I think that she's also the most anxious and reserved. Her and Scott bring the worst out of each other. 

Kylie - My opinions: She is more reserved than people think. She isn't as smart as people think but she isn't stupid. Yes, she is kinda practical but her brand would never make it if she wasn't Jenner and wouldn't have money for starting a company. I wish her well, but she was very lucky with upbringing and I don't think that makes her the best business woman, just... a good one I guess. 

Rob - What the hell. You have so much money, what are you doing? No, seriously, guy needs medication and a good and an intensive therapy. I think that he has some mental issues. 

Bruce - He was so cringey but I started watching Kardashians after the Kaitlyn coming out so I guess I already accepted him as a trans female so it didn't feel creepy. People who watched before the coming out - what did you think about him? 

Scott - I kinda dig him, but he's a trainwreck waiting to happen. He could be a tragic character in a fictive story. I feel sorry for him because he has no siblings or parents. He probably deals with serious issues like addiction and I hope he won't drink again."
17822,I watched before Caitlin came out and I think she was a better parent before transitioning. It seems like she gave so much of herself to her family for so long that one day she just quit.
17823,"Buce ranked above Scott? I am SHOCKED.

Bruce/Caitlyn is just the biggest piece of shit in my opinion, and really threw his family under the bus. Out of all the shit Kardashians have been through, they have never really gone against somebody in the family, they always had each others backs at the end of the day, Caitlyn literally tried to make money off of any drama and any potentially bad press for them that she could. If I was Kendall or Kylie idk how I could actually trust her.

I for sure think that Rob was dealing with substance abuse when he lived in Khloe and Lamar's house and that didn't help him at all with his mental health. at least now out of the spot light he seems to be doing ok. The lsat few snippets of him we've seen in snapchats he looks to have lost some weight.

Scott, I love him. He really has substance abuse issues, and also is using that to deal with his grief over the loss of his parents, but he seems to be on the up and up now. I really want him and Kourt back together, he seems to be a great dad and when things were good between him and Kourtney, they were really good. Kourtney just always keeps a guard up which leads to her having a stick up her ass 99% of the time unlike when they first got together.

And Kanye, well I am a Kanye Stan till I die, so he gets a spot too. I feel like even when people lash out at him fro saying something, it is truly just because he doesn't know how to properly articulate what is going on in his mind. As somebody who deals with ADHD and a swell of other mental health issues, I sometimes have the same problem, I can't fully articulate it to somebody the way it is making sense in my head...probably also why I leaned towards a creative career myself. I communicate better through my designs than anything else. Kanye will probably always be my number one right up there with Kris lol."
17824,"1. Khloe is funny, consistently entertaining, and genuinely cares about her family. She also seems to have more real confidence in who she is, like she has an actual personality that she’s not afraid to show. She can do much better than Tristan and I hope she will.
2. Kourtney seems down-to-earth and like she has a good head on her shoulders, even if that makes her annoying sometimes. If I could be friends with any of them, it would probably her her. 
3. Kris gives me mixed feelings because I feel like she exploited the Jenner kids before they could really consent, but also, they are rich because of her, so 🤷🏼‍♀️
4. Scott, like Khloe, is always good TV and I feel for his issues. I am really glad he seems to have pulled himself out of the alcoholism for a bit.
5. Kylie has no personality but, as with Kendall, I feel like I’d be equally anxious and guarded if raised on TV
6. Kendall for the same reason as above. Loses points for faux-wokeness.
7. I waver on Kim, but right now she’s not on my good list. Needs to find herself. 
8. Caitlin was a good dad, but I think her lifelong struggle with her identity caused some mental health issues that have resulted in a toxic person.
9. Kanye, as I’ve mentioned somewhere else, I think is not doing Kim any favors. Apologies to fans here but I think his lyrics about his daughters were creepy af, he treats Kim like a Barbie doll for him to play with, whines about the tortures of monogamy, and I’m over it. 
10. Rob is a MESS and his sock line is bad. I hope he gets help."
17825,"1. Kendal, she seems the most genuine and kind hearted of them all. She has always been my favorite. 

2. Kourtney, idk she always seems to be the most logistical, she is a strong backbone to the family imo.

3. Kim because kim

4. Khloe, shes hilarious! Always entertaining to watch! I just love her feisty personality. Although I think she comes of a bitch some times, I still think she is an amazing woman.

5. Kris, I love her... I really do. Sometimes she really bugs me but overall shes a great person and a great mother.

6. Robert, my heart hurts for him. I hope he finds happiness someday. .

7. Bruce/Caitlyn, in the early seasons i really liked Bruce, he was so chill and just minded his own business doing the things he loved. After the transition I feel like she was portrayed as this evil  entity. In the later seasons it was always awkward and so so cringey to watch them all interact with each other. I havent watched her show yet so I havent heard her side to then story. 

8. Kylie, by far my least favorite. Im not trying to be a snob but she drives me absolutely insane. I honestly can NOT stand her fake, self obsessed ass. She just comes off like such a bitch. Im sure irl shes a nice person, but I just HATE the way she is portrayed on the show."
17826,"1. Kourtney- love her to pieces. She is the realest of the bunch. So natural and beautiful and unbothered. Just love love love.

2. Khloe- super hilarious. She seems really genuine and is always entertaining.

3. Kendall- she is kind of boring but I think she is real and seems more humble than some of the others.

4. Kim- obnoxious. Full of herself. Overrated. Can not understand the fascination with her.

5. Kylie- FAKE. She is so unrecognizable at this point that I can’t even stand to look at her. She is also overrated and I cringe at the thought of her “earning” almost a billion dollars for makeup.. 🙄"
17827,"1)Kylie
2)Kim
3)Khloe
4)Kris
5)Scott
6)Kourtney
7)Hitler
8)Kendall"
17828,"kris - money rules her morals and ethics true boss bitch

Kylie- I personally can’t stand all the juvenile selfish and fake ass Shots. I don’t like liar, her lips don’t have all their filler removed.... come on.... leads back to kris and Kylie is now her favorite , why because Kylie is making her the most cash.

Kourtney- obviously depressed, totally treated like the redheaded stepchild. Kris is making her do the show, kourt must oblige to get her paycheck.


Khloe - mean mean mean, about to be even more mean and hateful. Verbally abusive, rushed to get prego so she could fit in with all the other sisters treating these precious babies like the hottest accessory. I will never believe she shares the same dad as Kim or kourt.

KenDULL, yes explains her.

Rob... Just embarrassed for him. Best he so his thing off camera. 

Kimberly Noel? Who???"
17829,"I'm just doing the K sisters. 

Personality-wise:

1.Khloe

2.Kourtney 

3.Kim 

Honestly, Kourtney and Kim are so boring. Kim, particularly, lacks personality. 

Hotness: 

1. Kylie/Kendall: both look so similar; both are hot ass bitches. 

2. Kourtney 

3. Khloe

4. Kim"
17830,"Fav is Kim, least favorite is Julie/Rob/Caitlyn. Can't decide.

EDIT: Khloe autocorrected to Julie, leaving it."
17831,"Excuse me, it’s actually spelled “Kulie”"
17832,So often I write Khlie instead of Khloe and sometimes I'm tempted to not correct it 😂.
17833,Always leave it. I've called Kim Jim so many times and it cracks me up.
17834,"Oh my God, this is hilarious. 

Normally I'm afraid that people don't think I meant to write Kylie instead lol."
17836,Too late. She's called Julie now. Its over.
17838,Your name is Khloe now. I don't make the rules.
17839,"Least favourite: Khloe she's racist, misogynistic, cringey, just tries way to hard everything about her just is unlikeable. Oh and i find Rob awful aswel sexist, misogynistic pig

Favourite: Dream Kardashian 🙂"
17840,awww i love dream!!! she's so cute :)
17841,Yup and the revenge porn incident forever cemented the fact that he’s just a loser.
17842,OP: who is your least fav?
17843,"i may get hate for this but i really dont like kourtney, i think she lacks empathy and just doesnt care about anything or anyone. she gaslights everybody but will never look at herself and admit that she is ever wrong. i also think she is a hypocrite with this whole “i care so much about the world” act when we all know how she and her family live. thats my opinion 🤔"
17844,"for sure! i think she “jokes” a lot about being amazing, and I dated a true narc who did the same all the time. I always brushed it off until more behavior led me to believe that he lacked empathy.  I think both her and scott have a similar narc-like sense of humor and both have shown disregard for others. i have a love/hate relationship with her because she truly seems like she has tried to learn and be better.  still lots of hypocrisy though ... “don’t use perfume it’s bad for you, but wait, here’s a toxic diamond perfume for you!!”"
17845,"I, like Kris, would say my favourite is Kim and least is Rob"
17846,Rob? ROB? You mean the man who takes the hit and gains all the weight so his family can farm his fat for their injections? Rob is the silent king for this lmfao
17847,ENOUGH 😭😭💀💀
17848,Stop I'm at my desk. At least let me pretend to be working
17849,Lolll this really made me laugh
66294,Lol
17851,Happy cake day!!
17852,You sweet thang!
17853,"Fave is Kim, I’ve really enjoyed watching her grow as a person over the years and develop into better person, and least fave is kourt. 

Don’t get me wrong she’s had some funny moments and memorable quotes, but I don’t like her personality, even during the early seasons with the Scott drama, whilst I’m not backing Scott, I couldn’t route for her, as I felt she was very toxic too, and her pregnancies were clearly not what Scott wanted and she didn’t care. He was in no position, mentally or otherwise, to have another kid, and she was like well I want one so oops I’m pregnant, deal with it"
17855,"Fave: Kim and Kris 
Least Fave : Kylie (she’s a bore) and Khloe, who used to be my fave, but I hate Pick mes."
17856,"Of the Jenner sisters, Kendall is my favorite. She seems the most grounded of the Kardashian-Jenner clan in general. Least favorite is Kylie. She just doesn't seem to have much personality, and I don't like her constant need for shots. Of the Kardashian sisters, I've gone back and forth a lot over the years, but my current favorite is Kim for how hardworking she is, and my current least favorite might be Khloe. She just seems like she's given up on her love life, and is letting Tristan call the shots because her self-esteem is so low after the cheating scandals. I feel bad for her. But, I also don't like her attitude over the past few years regarding how much or how little Kourtney shares about her life. Kourtney's personal life kept the show afloat for years; she's earned her privacy, and I'm sure her kids are approaching an age where they're thankful for it."
17858,"Same among the main sisters, Cait is probably my least favorite of the whole family."
17859,Among the whole is Rob for me. Yikes what a misogynist
17860,"Yeah Rob and Cait are neck and neck for who I dislike more I just can’t make up my mind they both suck so bad lol.

ETA: tbh and Scott too."
17861,"Same, it’s a shame because they were a great duo years ago too!"
17862,"I loved their relationship in the early years, it's truly why I got into the show! They were so funny together."
17864,"Khloe is my favorite come at me 😂 and Kim of course. Cait did Kris dirty, making her my least favorite. Kylie is also annoying but I love her skin care and make up lines. Kendall is boring and a brat."
17865,Kim has always been my favorite
17866,"Kylie is my least fave. The fact that she made herself look like Kim 2.0 creeps me out. I know I should feel sorry for her, but like.. c'mon. 

The whole, I got my lips this big by using double lip liner or whatever. And body by pregnancy/puberty/menstrual cycle. Girl, bye. Least Kim had natural curves to start with.

Fave. Kourtney cause her and Travis Barker are so IT. And other reasons."
17867,"Favorite is Kim, least favorite is a tie between Kourtney and Kendall"
17868,"My fav is Kim, she seems so nice, hardworking and after all she is the main star here"
17869,my favorite is definitely stormi because she’s so damn cute lmao. i think i have too many least favorites to pick just one 😅
17870,"Least fav currently is Khloe bc she’s so mean and hypocritical now. Fav was Kourtney bc I stan and underdog and that’s what she was with Kim and Khloe picking on her so much. I also appreciate that she hasn’t had as much work done and I’m not a huge fan of the plastic surgery/filler look. I hate the way she treats staff though, but most rich people do that shit, so maybe none of them are my fav now?"
17871,What happened with the staff?
17872,Search this sub for Kourtney + Nanny
17873,"Least favorite.... has to be Kendall for me. She just always seems so uptight & full of herself, I can't stand the way she talks to other people & I really can't stand that she talked so much shit to Kylie only to turn around and get the same shit done. I also truly despise Caitlyn, she can get fucked. 

*side note- I always thought it was hilarious as Cait was transitioning, she told Kris this whole thing would make her (Cait) a ""better person"" LOL yeah, okay!"
17875,I get you. I always tought that kendall is nicer than Kylie but i feel like she hides her rudeness with anxiety. Im very curious about how Kylie actually is besides her sexy pictures and character
17876,“kendall is a fake stoner” y’all just wanna hate so bad LMFAOO
17880,babe you have no argument against your own claim
17881,Lol this is getting so spicy I’m here for it.
17882,lol love to give some entertainment 🥰
17883,You’re doing the lords work.
17885,"you and me both my friend, I'm looking at my screen like 👁👄👁"
17886,Yeah I’m just tryna find my popcorn. Get her Jade!
17887,I am living while sis is dying 😂😂😂😂
17889,and how do you know she’s not chill? i’ve watched her radio show and she seems pretty chill to me but even if she wasn’t chill that’s not a valid argument anyways cause being a stoner ≠ being a non asshole
17891,you wrote all that and still have no proof of her being a fake stoner
17892,"Kendall tries way too hard to seem kinda alternative/artsy/elegant and it all seems like such an act. Like I remember seeing her post a pic of an easel and I was like yeah of course 🙄

I usually wouldn’t call someone a “fake stoner” because I don’t think smoking weed is impressive or a personality trait lol but I get what you’re saying here."
17893,Are we really gate keeping smoking weed now?
17894,"For real...never understood people taking drugs or drinking alcohol being competitive against each other. Kendall is cringe for promoting smoking drugs like it's cool and this person is cringe for gatekeeping weed like it's some sort of cool shit that only real ones does.

I have no problem with people smoking but shut the fuck up about it, don't make this ""a thing""."
17895,"~~I’m~~ In Kendall’s defense I don’t think she promotes it as a big part of her personality, I think (?) she was asked about it on a talk show and basically was like yeah I’m a stoner."
17896,Kourtney is my fav because I appreciate her authenticity. Khloe has unfortunately become my least fav because of her bullying / negative attitude.
17897,"**Overall:**  
**Scott=Kim>Kourt>Rob>Khloe>Kylie>Kris>kendall** 

Kim is my favorite, I think she is really funny/a diva but have never heard of her being rude to fans etc. 

Kourt was tied for my fav growing up but her personality has changed a lot in the last like four years and now she is not as funny/kind of annoying at times but i don't dislike her. I feel bad for Khloe tbh but she has been annoying me lately as well with blaming others for everything. 

I really dislike Kris she is just too much for me (ever since the first season she is just sooo obnoxious). Kylie has no personality and just looks so fake now and talks weird. Kendall annoys me lol she's so whiney and has no sense of humor. Loved Rob in the early episodes but now he clearly has a lot of issues."
17898,"Fave - Kim. All day. Every day. Twice on a Sunday.

Least Fave - Kourt."
17899,"Kim is my fave cause at the end of the day she’s the reason we are all even here talking together. I appreciate how she’s always nice to fans and her activism. 

Kendall and Kourtney are my least favorite. I grew up with white girls exactly like them lol."
17900,Kourtney is my favorite and the rest equally annoy me.I prefer the bluntness of Kourtney which is what I feel the others lack.
17901,"Kourtney’s my favourite, most of the time idk why. Least favourite is Khloe cos of that fake baby voice & the whole ‘True needs a sibling’ excuse"
17902,Kourt is my fave I don’t really have a least fave Kim and Khloe do annoy me the most but with Kim it’s usually her stans that make her more annoying to me and Khloe it’s her delusion
17903,"Kim is my fav and Caitlyn, then Scott and Kourtney are my least."
17906,Fave is Kim least is Kendall
17909,Gabanna
17910,"At first I hated Khloe, I thought she was needlessly aggressive to Scott before they became close. Once she calmed down she was one of my favorites, I thought she was funny and down to earth. But now I can't stand her again, half the time she's preaching ""peace love and harmony"" and the other half she's bragging about ""rich bitch energy"", attacking Jordyn for only her part in the Tristan saga, emotionally abusing Kourtney, simping after Kim, etc. 

I liked Kim aside from the times she would act bratty, but the past 2-3 seasons have completely turned me off to her, I think she's become very toxic. 

I know people say Kendall is entitled and they've had rude experiences with her, which I'm sure are true. But as far as what I've seen of her on the show, I do like that her energy is pretty chill. 

Someone already mentioned this, but one thing I appreciate about Kylie is her keeping her private life pretty low key. Setting aside her using Stormi as a promotional prop, I still like that she isn't as extra as Kim. 

I've never liked Kris lol, textbook narcissist if you ask me.

I think Kourtney's the funniest sister (before her sisters drove her to depression). I like that she doesn't necessarily want fame, she just wants a comfortable life. I also appreciate that she's one of the only family members who sees the value in therapy, I can't stand how Kim and Khloe constantly dismiss mental health. I hope Kourtney is able to carve out a healthy life for herself. 

So to answer the OP's question, I'm going to cheat and say my favorite KarJenner has and always will be SCOTT! #longlivelorddisick"
17911,"Thank you for such a detailed response, I love seeing everyone’s thoughts on each persons it’s great! I love Scott too such a funny guy who has brought so much entertainment to the show!"
17912,Probably Kylie. The older sisters are are getting on my nerves lol.
17913,"Yeah, Kylie has grown on me. It seems like for the most part she keeps her mouth shut (I can’t think of any huge scandals with her except the “self made” thing, and she probably didn’t come up with that headline personally). I appreciate that she keeps her life fairly private given her job and the life that she has, we don’t hear much about relationship or friend drama with her and she doesn’t seem to put that stuff on blast for $$ unlike Khloe. Of course there was the Jordyn thing but Kylie was pretty quiet through it all.

She also strikes me as a good mom, I saw a video of her and Stormi cooking and when Stormi spilled something she didn’t scold her but said “whoops, let’s clean it up,” there were a few situations like that where she just seemed to provide good guidance and encouragement. 

Overall I respect that she hasn’t made her fortune off of drama, of course she was born rich and had a HUGE leg up in life but she built a business around something she clearly loves (makeup) and stays out of drama for the most part. She seems pretty relaxed and laid back."
17914,The constant fighting with the older 3 is ridiculous!
17915,"I'm probably the only one, but I like Kendall. I like that she's doing her own thing and I can relate to her anxiety. It doesn't mean I always agree with her, but I like her attitude towards life"
17916,"Yeah I quite like watching interviews with Kendall, she’s actually a lot funnier than I feel a people giver her credit for"
17917,"My favorite right now is definitely Kylie! She’s mellowed out a lot ever since she had stormi and I think for a little while she went thru that teenager phase where she was rude to her parents and just didn’t seem very interested in doing family things but you also have to understand she was acting in ways normal teens would but she was being filmed and able to be judged, and also her dad transitioned to Caitlyn when she was I think only 17 or 18?  Which probably was a lot for her to deal with and she probably came off very dry and rude when she was just hurting. But anyways when she was a teen she wasn’t one of my favorites but now I really like her because she does a lot of donating and helping people in need behind closed doors and doesn’t brag about it, and she also stays out of the drama and even when everything happened with Jordyn last year she didn’t go off about jordyn on tv like her sisters did which I thought was cool of her! (Sorry this was long lol)"
17918,"Kylie , except when she does stupid thing like trademarking 'raise and shine '. She's just chill. I like that"
