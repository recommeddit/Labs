17276,lol...
17277,I’d like to recommend [Retro Bowl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-bowl/id1478902583) ($0.99 full game unlock). It’s a fantastic Tecmo Bowl-inspired football game that has intuitive touch controls and surprisingly deep management elements. Here’s a [Pocket Gamer article](https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/081967/retro-bowl-is-a-new-american-football-sim-for-ios-and-android-from-the-creators-of-new-star-soccer/) about it.
17278,OMG thanks for this!
17279,Maaaaan it bummed me out when SMT became incompatible. What a good game that was to have on the phone.
17280,"To The Moon and Journey are also great games that I haven’t seen anyone mentioned yet. 

Btw Dragon Quest VIII’s last update removed the 15fps cap. It’s running at a solid 30fps on my 2020 SE."
17281,Don’t forget about Roller Coaster Tycoon Classic.
17282,"Isn’t Grid supposed to be pretty excellent? I’ve only played on console, but heard good things about the ports"
17283,"GRID: Autosport? Idk, but drift mode feels impossible for me even when using a controller. Maybe it’s just me. Everything else is on spot though, best racing sim on mobile."
17284,"[Life is Strange ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange/id1180101534?l=en) and [Life is Strange : Before the Storm ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange-before-storm/id1293250289?l=en) ( Life is Strange Prequal ) 
Both free with 12.99$ for all episodes"
17285,"I’d add doom 1 & 2. With the support of community add one, these ports are incredible and offer an endless amount of content. They also play incredible with a controller."
17286,"Any recommendations for games like the room series, house of Davinci or monument valley? Finished these and need a new one. Thanks in advance"
17287,"If you want good puzzle games, I **very, very much** recommend the Professor Layton trilogy. They are great ports of a classic DS series full of puzzles challenging enough to keep you engaged, and a lovable, memorable cast of characters."
17288,Thank you. Played them all including on the Nintendo DS. Love them!!!!!
17289,Dead cells for sure!
17290,If only Apple Arcade games can be purchase separately.
17291,"**Classics**: 

[Hyper Light Drifter Special Edition](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyper-light-drifter/id1453875289) ($4,99)  
The Hyper Light Drifter by Heart Machine that we all know and love, but with extra content: locations, weapons and challenges. Supports controllers (MFi, PS4 and Xbox) - if you feel like touch screen doesn't give the precision you want, this usually helps. :) The game also plays awesome on Apple TV. (Console experience, mobile price!)  
**Retro with a twist:** 

[Cursed Castilla](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cursed-castilla/id1468871893) ($3,99)  
This is where Medieval Spain meets classic retro arcade gameplay.   
A demon used tears of a young witch to release the evil from hell. Knight Don Ramiro is tasked with kicking the evil out of Tolomera. You'll meet all kinds of creatures from European folklore, many of which you had no idea about! Apple TV? Of course!  
   
[The Curse of Issyos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-curse-of-issyos/id1500724078) ($2,99)  
Off to Ancient Greece! Defkalion was fishing at the calm blue sea, when Goddess Athena told him the Isle of Issyos has been cursed by the Olympus! Defkalion heads back home to save his only daughter, Delia. A creative take on retro arcade gameplay + Ancient Greek mythology. Slightly more forgiving than our other retro titles. :) Got it on iPhone/iPad - it's already on your Apple TV!   
[Super Hydorah](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-hydorah/id1348224049) ($4.99)   
Space shoot'em up, anybody? The star of Omios has been infested with Meroptians, very unfriendly biomechanical creatures. And yes, only you, the best spaceship pilot of the Universe, can free the star. Will you?   
If you like Gradius, R-Type, Darius... you'll love Super Hydorah. Even more with a controller on Apple TV!

**For the busy players (short and immersive):** 

[Mindkeeper - The Lurking Fear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindkeeper-the-lurking-fear/id1473252201) ($1,99)  
The game originally developed for the Apple Watch, now also showcased at Apple Stores worldwide (if you happen to go to one - please send us a pic! ;))   
It's a Lovecraftian horror puzzle adventure with very short but immersive levels and one-finger control on all platforms: Apple Watch (Digital Crown), iPhone/iPad (touch screen) and Apple TV (Siri remote). You play as investigator H. Joyce exploring a mansion deep in the Swamp of Storms to reveal the secret of the lurking fear.  


We're [the publishing and development team in charge](https://twitter.com/abylight) of these games, so will be happy to answer any questions! :)"

17294,I mean most of these are just ports
17295,Pretty much this. And old. I was on my first wife when Bioshock came out for Christ’s sake.
17296,Modern combat is not available anymore a long time ago or is it because I’m in Germany that would be weird cuz it’s on android still
17297,"I hear that you can’t use cheats on San Andreas as it’s based on the pc version and requires a keyboard, does anyone know more about this?"
17298,Exiled Kingdoms. One of my top 3 of all time.
17299,I refuse to believe a list that doesn’t include FTL.
17300,Good post. Thank you

17303,"Damn I totally forgot about Infinity Blade... definitely brought back some memories for me! As well as the rip-off from Glu Games, the Blood & Glory series LOL

Middle school me definitely jailbroke my phone just to get those free gems"
17304,Sad to see the Infinity Blade series didn't make the cut.
17306,"""Removed game"""
17307,Darkest Dungeon tablet edition
17308,Miss the old Gameloft so much. They used to focus on paid high-quality games. Now full of free to play trash.
17309,GTA: San Andreas and Total War is great.
17310,"Hyper Light Drifter, Grimvalor, Pascal's Wager, Immortal Rogue, Undead Horde, Crying Suns, Inside, Thimbleweed Park, Deus Ex GO."
17311,"Take a look at unmemory, a mix of reading and puzzles.
https://unmemory.info/"
17312,Anyone know how well San Andreas plays with a controller? I’m one of the 3 people who haven’t played it and I really wouldn’t mind playing it on my phone with my Xbox controller clip.
17313,Me too. Also wondering whether you can change the controller mapping.
17314,"go for it, best port!"
17315,Can you use cheats in San Andreas? I have vice city and it’s not as fun without cheats
17316,"No, without third-party app"
17317,Shame. Thanks for the list anyway
17318,"No mention of slay the spire. 

My problem with your list is that the list doesn’t account for personal preferences. I like card games, rogue likes and RPGs. But you only mentioned 1 rpg that i actually like, didn’t mention any card games or rogue likes. These games are “great” for whoever likes them, but if I hadn’t already played it I wouldn’t even know what kind of games they are. I think you should at least give them a genre, or better, organize games by genre. Personally, I wouldn’t enjoy the bulk of this list and disagree that it’s a list of great games."
17319,Lol all “best games” lists are a matter of preference. You can’t expect OP to know each and every best game in each game genre in the hopes of appeasing your love of card games
17320,Why was this reply so hostile my dude
17322,"For those curious the top 3 (not mobile) are:

1. Tetris
2. Super Mario Bros. 3
3. The Legend of Zelda"
17323,Tetris is on iOS?
17324,No those were the ones not on mobile
17325,Tetris is on iOS though
17326,Oh. I'm not OP
17328,"What would you consider the original Tetris? The gb version? NES versions? The pc versions, arcade versions?"
17329,"Any list that includes a Kim Kardashian game as one of the top 500 video games is full of shit. 

Sorry to be so negative, you did a kick ass job putting this together!"
17331,Is that the metric they’re using? That’s not a measure of quality.
17332,"That game rules, though."
17333,Agreed. The game is pretty good. This comment was probably just some sexist shit.
17334,Ms. Pac-man? Really?
17335,You guys need to remember that this is a list of all time best games not the best current mobile games.
17336,Thanks for your hard work.
17337,"I think that list isn't very good. It's completely missing a lot of RPGs, like the Dragon Quest or Baldur's Gate games. Then it has a random adventure game like Gone Home ranked very high."
17339,"[Dragon Quest 8 is on iOS.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest-viii/id862972069?mt=8) You are missing Dragon Quest 8 from your list.

I don't see Dragon Quest IV-VI on their list, those are some of the best JRPGs ever made. Baldur's Gate 1/2 are also missing. Baldur's Gate 2 is arguably the best western RPG ever made. It's up there with KotOR and Final Fantasy VII in terms of influence.

edit: They have Dragon Warrior, an alternate name for [Dragon Quest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest/id911201894?mt=8). That's on iOS"
17340,"Dragon warrior is not an alternative name, its a different game. Just like pokemond red is not another name for pokemon gold"
17342,False. Dragon warrior had stuff like breeding which dragon quest does not. It was a different game..
17344,"Yes thats what im talking about, wasnt it obvious?

Did i miss something?"
17346,"Ohh i didnt know of that one, my bad.
I thought dragon warrior was the same as dragon quest monsters. Thanks for the info.

I apologize for sounding ignorant"
17347,how tf is gta 3 ahead of gta sa by like 50 spots BS
17348,3 was pretty revolutionary when it came out.  I’m sure that’s why
17349,"Yeah GTA 3 was the one that defined the entire franchise and had an enormous impact on the open world genre that is still felt to this day. SA, while a technical achievement and a significant refinement of the formula, just can’t make those same claims."
17350,good point i could be biased due to nostalgia
17351,This was nice of you to put together.
17352,I stopped reading at the Kim Kardashian game.
17353,"Better than Final Fantasy 10 and Devil May Cry!

It’s even higher than Angry Birds, which surely must be a bigger breakthrough in mobile gaming"
17354,How is INSIDE so low on that list?
17355,Good post OP. Thanks for the links.
17356,Worst rating list in this galaxy
17357,Played 24 games of this list (not all on my iphone since there a lot of ports). But the best iOS games I played are not here.

17474,Thank you for making it.
17475,Is PaD worth getting into in 2021? I dabbled with the game very briefly about 2 years ago and was nearly immediately given some ultra high tier dragon (probably as a cheap catch-up mechanic) that one shot every single encounter for 4 straight hours. I ended up stop playing because the entire experience was so trivialized.
17476,I’ve played for like 7 years now on and off. I’m still amazed at the content the game has and while the early stages are very easy the later parts of the game are very challenging. I have top tier everything but having 0 continue wins is still very challenging.
17477,Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes

17481,This is a fun game until you realize the devs will continue to move benchmarks and nerf the characters you worked hard for to encourage spending. Its a cash grab sadly.
17482,"I dont agree. I play it for 2 years. You must have all the teams anyway , it s a collecting game. You shouldnt focus on one char or on one team.

17489,"1. Pascal s' Wager - I really like this game. Originally developed for the mobile platforms, but the game feels like a console game. It's a souls like, but much much easier (except the final boss). The world is dark enough, lot of upgrades for characters, and more cool things. This game has 2 main DLCs, the first not too fun, but the Tides of Oblivion adds a new chapter to the game. I hope in the near future we got new chapters, finally the multiplayer mode, a resolution boost (for the A14 and M1 devices), and an announcement for the sequel/ a new cool game from the developers. /
2. Grimvalor - This game is from the developers of Swordigo. Can i say more? Really fun platformer hack&slash, i buy'd 3 times (Android, Switch, Ios)."
17490,"Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever, it is also educational into past and present day. Not for the soft at heart and it is an adult game based on the content and story.

KOF 2012- This is such an underrated game but one of the best fighters, and whilst the graphics aren’t great the game runs really smooth on mobile.

Journey - Do I need to say anymore, timeless piece of art game and perfect port.

Hyper light drifter - Again a great artistic game with lots of character and soul

Alien Blackout - Very good game for mobile and intense gameplay, fun but daunting, great graphics and atmosphere

Taiko pop tap - so fun, great gameplay, graphics and new upgrades for songs to keep on coming back, very Japanese

Mo Astray - Another deep and thought provoking game, strange and interesting, excellent gameplay, tricky puzzles, great artwork

Under Depths of fear - Intense and atmospheric game, very good graphics and sound work, truly quite scary

Secret of Mana - The original and one of the best rpgs ever 

Absolute Drift - simple but fun and addictive car drifting game, great art style"
17491,"> Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever,

17492,"Stardew Valley. It has everything you want in a game. Great story, tons to do, can play offline, relaxing. Just a great game. Also massive update coming sometime that introduces a bunch more to do."
17493,Is 1.5 not on mobile yet?
17494,Nope sadly not. The developer is working with someone new to do the port. So I guess a lot of knowledge transfer is happening. Should hopefully speed up future updates
17495,"Paid: Dead Cells - The Good Kind of Pain

Apple Arcade: Oregon Trail - Endless Fun

Free: Soda Dungeon - More Endless Fun, not P2W"
17496,Ive played true skate the most consistently lol
17497,"Fact that nobody mentioned Brawl-Stars is crazy. 

Best F2P game i've played in forever, been playing for about 2 years now give or take, spent about $30-$50 over those two years and own literally everything in the game now.

I never grinded, just played a bit everyday or once in a while, sometimes i'll take weeks off before I play again.

All in all, for a F2P gacha arena fighting game, it really doesn't feel cash grabby at all whatsoever. As a person with a very disposable income, I feel basically zero need to spend money in the game unless theres a skin I want."
17498,"I seemed to hit a ceiling where I couldn't progress fast at all. I don't remember the trophy count, somewhere between 8k-10k trophies I think. I had 4-5 or more brawlers over 500 trophies etc.

I kept getting stupid team mates that would stand around or leave etc. It was a frustrating time. I could do solo brawls and get trophies but I had to play meta champs if I wanted to play to win."
17499,"I really like Holedown for paid games, simple addictive fun. Shame it’s not longer.

Playing Dragalia Lost right now, first gacha game I’ve found myself enjoying."
17500,Cod mobile is amazing. Playing some of the old maps is fun.  Also hill climb racing 2
17501,"Im really surprised how good the mobile version is, it's recommended if you like those sorts of games for sure."
17502,Literally better than Cold War lol
17503,"In simulation/building games, Apple Arcade Outlanders had me hooked from the first to the last level."
17504,Beyond the steel sky and World of demons.
17505,"I would go with Genshin Impact, for reasons already said by one poster.

Also rans: Eve Echoes, Infinite Lagrange, Second Galaxy, Arknights, Honkai Impact 3rd, Perfect World Mobile, Dragon Raja, Super Mecha Champions."
17506,SMC was so well executed except for the bots and playerbase. :( Game was amazingly built otherwise.
17507,Is EvE Echoes still decent? Haven’t played it since November.
17508,"I also hasn't played it for a while but they have just celebrated their first anniversary with a cool music video and a lengthy dev blog detailing their road map and content additions.  Personally I am into Infinite Lagrange now, which to me is like Stellaris on steroids with the visual flavor of EVE and Homeworld."
17509,"Genshin Impact was double Google/Apple 2020 game of the year, king of PVE games globally in revenue and player base, cross play and save with PC and PS4.

There is simply nothing even close in production value.  Everything else looks like PS2 games in comparison.  They are so far ahead competitors can't even see their tail lights."
17510,Totally agree. The game is gorgeous and has heavy breath of the wild vibes
17511,How much of the game can I feasibly enjoy as a full blown f2p scrub? Games like these seem to have end game stuff so far out of reach for those without a budget to whale.
17512,"You probably have a solid 40-50 hours of content without really any need to pay. And there is a huge content drop happening in roughly a little over a week that adds a whole new continent. The only reason to drop money is because you really want a character, but the game does a decent job at giving you everything you possibly need. And there are guides out there that can show you how to excel with a F2P team. There is a lot to do and explore before taking on the “end-game” which is pretty much only Spiral Abyss (think kind of like an endless dungeon where you keep fighting until you lose). But since there is no PvP, there isn’t an incentive beyond that to pay."
17513,Way longer than 40-50 hours I had over 30 in the game as a F2P before the second continent area dropped. I just started playing again after taking a break for months and the amount of stuff they have added since then is staggering. You can enjoy the entirety of the game as a F2P player the money is for characters and weapons really.
17514,"You can complete everything in the game F2P. There are loads of people that have done 0 wish accounts and have been able to complete the hardest content in the game.

The only thing you really need to pay for is characters you want, but even then if u save and plan accordingly you can get the character you want. Though it is impossible to get every character unless u whale.

I think the game is plenty fun, they often have lots of events to get 4 star characters either for free or by the events giving a lot of primogems (the currency used to wish on banners)

Give it a go, its free after all."
17515,"Money really only helps with horizontal progression, i.e. limited time characters and such. It's generally agreed that the rare 5-star characters are stronger, but it's akin to the difference between heroes in Overwatch's early poor-balance days, not to your typical gacha where rare characters are twice as good. 

If you doubt me, look up a few tier lists. You'll find that they are all over the place and almost never agree where someone belongs. Despite owning more than half the roster, I actually use the main starting character in my core team because he's fun to play and totally viable if you build it right.

There's even a community of people dedicated to soloing the game with Amber, the ""worst"" character (who is still fine)."
17516,I think most botw comparisons are just skin deep. Genshin is nowhere near the depth of botw
17517,Genshin is similar to BotW on the surface level. It's very deep on fighting and character interaction (kits wise) aspects.
17518,"Probably the Rusty Lake games (horror/puzzle, most free, a few premium). I know they’re older than that but I only recently discovered them!

Honorable mentions: Alter Ego (idle tapper/psychological test, free, pay to remove ads), There is No Game (retro arcade/puzzle, with a story, paid), Elder Scrolls: Blades (RPG, free, can buy some unnecessary bonuses), and Simon’s Cat (casual, in Arcade)."
17519,"How do you like elder scrolls blades? I got it when it came out, but felt the combat was a little awkward. (More awkward than the elder scrolls usually is)"
17520,"Yeah, the combat is awkward, but it’s simple enough to get the hang of (even though I am not at all coordinated). I liked it a lot! But, I was both extremely sick and the world was shut down when I was playing it. I think rebuilding the town and walking through forests and caverns made it more therapeutic than usual."
17521,Star Wars Force Arena. A star wars take on Clash Royal but with added control of your leading Unit One of the best competitive games I played on mobile with a fair and nice monetization model to where they just give you pretty much everything. Sadly the game was shut down a while back. F
17522,"Pascal’s wager, Space Marshals (1 2 3), Unruly Heroes


Paid only, freemium is shit."
17523,"Unruly Heroes looks nice except yikes, that privacy status is one of the worst I’ve ever seen. They take almost everything!"
17524,"Eclidus, Skiing Yeti Mountain, and Downwell"
17525,"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night - Excellent metriodvania by the man himself. 

Huntdown - Modern contra type game. One IAP to unlock the whole game. Great game. 

Civilization VI - I still can’t believe how well this works on a phone. 

PUBG Mobile - Incant help enjoying the hell out of this game. It really captures the spirit of the PC game."
17526,"-Quest
-Rogue Party
-Banner Saga
-Clash Royale"
17527,"The only games I have played for over 5 years are Puzzle and Dragons and Wayward Souls.
Those seriously passed the test of time for me."

17533,"SNKRX 

Melvor Idle"
17534,Arknights
17535,"FANTASIAN on Apple Arcade is great, though it’s only the first part out now with the second part coming later this year.  Done by the some of the people that worked on the old Final Fantasy games.  Absolutely beautiful backgrounds that are all physical dioramas with the 3D sprites layered over top."
17536,Fortnite lol
17537,"Legends of Runeterra is the best CCG since Android:Netrunner, offline or on.  Deep, snappy, fun, beautiful  with a generous model."
17538,marvel strike force. Marvel characters. Good graphics. Good tactical turned base combat. Reasonably f2p friendly.
17539,"After playing dozens of games (mostly f2p) Marvel Strike Force is my daily grind game now.  Production values are pretty high for mobile and the game has enough content to keep me playing for a few months.  Somewhat f2p-friendly.  

For the love of your wallet, don’t pay anything though!  The monetization in that game is one of the worst I’ve ever seen!  And the /r/marvelstrikeforce sub is full of p2w horror stories."
17540,"Competitive: CoD Mobile, Wild Rift, AutoChess

F2P: DarkZone, Curse of Aros

Kinda p2w: Zooba

Gacha: V4, AFK SkillMaster, Auto Battles

Will answer questions about each if you are curious :) I like purely competitive mobile games or idle games."
17541,"XCOM 2, Shantae and the 7 Sirens, LoL: Wild Rift, Legends of Runeterra. If I should pick only one, it’s XCOM 2"
17542,I Wish xcom2 released here in my country's app store
17543,"* Stardew Valley -- always going for multiple years
* Farm RPG (fun game, but love the dev and community. so addictive for people who like text based games)
*  Rainy Attic Room (story based, very slow--you are slowly helping a ""person"" in an attic),"
17544,Still Clash Royale after almost 5 years
17545,I feel your pain man. Stockholm Syndrome is real.
17546,Ark Survival Evolved
17547,EVE: Echoes
17548,"XCOM 2 Collection - Hot take, it's better implemented than desktop."
17549,Shadow fight 2: everything from the story to the plot twists to mechanics it completely outdoes itself as a mobile game
17550,"Battle for Polytopia is great. It’s a civ-lite turn based strategy game. The IAPs are just for additional tribes, but you don’t need to buy them to enjoy the game. 

Probably my most played iPhone game. Good for quick bursts. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-battle-of-polytopia/id1006393168"
17551,I’ve put a stupid amount of time into Polytopia. For me it is the best money I’ve ever put into an iOS game. And that was just for some additional tribes to play. This is the one I keep going back to!
17552,I’ve tried a few times to play that but there was no tutorial and I didn’t really know how to play
17553,So I’m confused . Is it real-time  online?
17555,"Thanks for the rec, just tried it and it's fun!"
17556,Hexoinia I find better.
17557,"OP - Hexonia is worth trying too. This guy’s getting downvoted because of a weird Polytopia vs Hexonia fandom thing. They’re very similar games and so the fandoms feel like they have to pick a side.

They’re both great games. I prefer Polytopia, but Hexonia definitely worth checking out too."
17558,"That's fine mate,
I can't be even bothered to give a $hit about getting downvoted.
Enjoy your day and thanks for stepping up for me.
Cheers"
17559,No problem. Just wanted OP to know the downvotes aren’t a reason not to try Hexonia.
17560,"Data wing, not even in app purchases or ads. It’s just free. And still an awesome game."
17561,Data Wing is phenomenal story telling for its format. I love that game.
17562,100% recommend data wing
17563,"I'm surprised no one said Among Us yet. 

So if you're a fan of murder mystery, or the movie ""The Thing"", then you'll love this one. It's a game where you work with a group of 5-10 people, and try to complete as many tasks as possible. However, one (or three depending on the game settings), is an imposter and he/she is trying to kill everyone to win. They can sabotage tasks, kill people, and do whatever possible so that the other survivors cannot win. 

Try it out, it's free and I got addicted the first 5 minutes of it. You'll love it."
17564,"Yea, it’s really good, but they need to add more to the game like more roles. Or at least new items or rooms."
17565,You’re right. the game doesn’t update as much as I hoped.
17566,I downloaded this and it was fun but I’m color blind and it got really difficult when I saw the imposter and didn’t know what color it was haha
17567,"I downloaded this off the bat from your recommendation, it’s actually really fun, tysm!"
17568,Happy to help! Been looking to join a community to play this with (seriously there are a lot of trolls in this game too which ruins the experience)
17569,"i personally love fallout shelter, although i'm still considered a beginner (40 dwellers) I have not been pressured to buy into the game, imo it's not pay to win"
17570,The sequel Fallout Shelter Online just launched yesterday in many countries. You can find the APK if you are on Android.
17571,"Soda Dungeon - All of the IAPs, including no advertising, can be earned and bought through gameplay.  The premium currency doesn't need to be bought either as you can earn it just from playing too.  You can play this RPG as either an idle game by using auto combat or a turn-based RPG.  The sequel comes out in a few months.

.Decluser Zero - Vertical top scrolling bullet hell shooter.  Pretty much anything by this game's developer is worth considering.

Pixel Puzzle Collection - Picross puzzle game where the solutions are characters, power ups, bosses and other things from various Konami games.  Although of the games featured, I have played Parodius a lot and not so much the others, I've found this very enjoyable.

Cube Escape - is a series of room escape games that are related to the Rusty Lake games.

Armory & Machine - one of the best totally free incremental/idle games.

Costume Quest - my favorite free RPG.  The one not downside is that you cannot upgraded past iOS 10.  If you have an older device or one you're just not upgrading the iOS any further, make sure that you install the free add-on IAP or you won't have sound effects."
17572,"Two Dots. 

You never need to IAP tools, I’ve got three stars on every single game level without using tools. 

It’s just so well made and there are new levels every week."
17573,"That game is a time sinkhole, I remember when I first started playing on my iPhone 4"
17574,"I love it! There's just enough new content (once you've done all the ""main game"" levels) in the weekly challenges to have enough to do while waiting for the train etc. 

I'm continually impressed how good the balance is, because I've played games like Frozen Freefall extensively and after a while you reach levels that cannot be completed without tools.

That said, I wasn't so keen on their subsequent release, Dots & Co - the balancing wasn't nearly so well done there."
17575,"I believe you meant ""timesink""."
17576,Was sinkhole then added time xD. Also didn’t know timesink even existed as a word which I don’t believe it is since it’s been flagged as wrong as i wrote this.
17577,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_sink
17578,"I Stand corrected, but the dictionary won’t though."
17579,"http://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/time+sink

:)"
17580,the phone’s dictionary
17581,hehe
17582,I forgot about this game till you wrote it here. This is a goodie for sure.
17583,[Two Spies](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/two-spies/id1466304408) is fantastic and the only IAP is cosmetic to help support the development. Turn based spy vs spy strategy game.. each game takes around 10-15 minutes typically.
17584,"Thanks, this is really good one."
17585,Soul Knight is a good game to play. You could play alone or with up to 4 people.
17586,soul knight is a must-have for everyone imo
17587,Legends of Runeterra if you’re into card games. Mind blowing how generous it is.
17588,This. Best digital card game (personal opinion). But def the most budget friendly
17589,I would keep keep up with Riots stuff in general. They do f2p right. They just announced their gorgeous looking league of legends mobile port is not going to have ads in app at all. TFT is also really well done.
17590,"Sick, any word on the moba release date?"
17591,Gotta be about 2 or 3 months at this point. They have a going in Brazil right now. Can’t be much longer after that.
