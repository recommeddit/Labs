11972,To be left alone. If my wife took my kids out for the day that would be awesome. I love them all dearly but a day of me time without being asked to do shit for everyone else would be fabulous. It turns into a day where I have to do shit I don't want to do because everyone else has their own ideas about what fathers day should be.
11973,So... just like Mother's Day
11974,This is every fucking day not fathers day. I can relate bud.
11975,"I always show my father the [Dad Life Rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOKuSQIJlog&hd=1) on Father's Day.

He always seems to enjoy it."
11976,"To drink decent Scotch with my brothers while we bar-b-que in the back yard, worry free."
11977,"I have never seen that.  As a father, I laughed so much.  Thank you!"
11978,"You're welcome. And Happy Father's Day in advance! I love that video. I love how it embraces (and exaggerates) all of the quirks, but does it in a respectful manner instead of just an ""UGGGHHH DAD"" perspective."
11979,"What? So you mean my dad doesn't enjoy his annual ""Best father ever"" mug. :("
11980,A new PS3 controller or a gift card to my local comic book store.
11982,"Steaks... in the freezer? He said father, not Monster."
11983,"Gotta buy in bulk with meat prices nowadays, especially t-bones/filets"
11985,Quick recipe for that?
11986,Peace and fucking quiet
11987,Shit when is Father's Day?
11988,June 15th.  You got a little time.
11989,You're doing ~Gods~ Googles work here son
11990,"I've actually enjoyed every gift my children have given me. I don't *need* anything and they've put thought, effort and consideration into the gifts."
11991,"As a son, that's what I love to hear. Knowing my dad appreciates me, despite my empty wallet."
11992,A joke book.
11993,"Dad joke book, or just a joke book?

If either, google 'man with no arms and no legs jokes'"
11994,"Some god damn peace and quiet.


I have seen people catch shit about not wanting to be with their kid, but the reality is you put in hard work to be a good father the rest of the year and deserve a day off."
11995,"I've told my wife all I want is to sit home and watch the US Open undisturbed. I'll get to watch the US Open, it's the undisturbed part that likely won't happen."
11996,"Just that my son continues to have good health, and a good time.  He's going to be 16 on July 23rd.  He's a master sergeant in JROTC in high school, and a straight A student.  He gets to take AP Chem next year, and wants to get his masters in Mech Engineering.  I couldn't be more happy or proud :)"
11997,"My birthday is July 23, and so is my mother's. And Daniel Radcliffe, as well as the Hubble telescope (I think that's accurate). Not entirely relevant, but from one father to another, congratulations, and happy Fathers day."
11998,"Thank, and same to you.  Be sure to hug the rascal(s) :)"
11999,I think my dad would like a cold beer and a nice game of English football to watch. And maybe a new car.
12000,New lazy boy recliner.
12001,"An extra couple of beers and a BJ following my usual birthday dinner, which I'm not complaining about."
12002,Just a 'Happy Father's Day' from my kids....and a some homemade chocolate chip cookies that I can gorge on until I fall into a sugar OD coma.
12003,"Last year I went mountain biking in the morning, met the family for a great picnic lunch and swim in a lake, then finished the ride."
12004,"Socks and undies... seriously, as you get older the simple pleasures are the best."
12005,"Seriously TMI, but a BJ is all I would want."
12006,From your kids??
12007,"He's not a creep, only the oldest one."
12008,"From my wife, crazy. My daughter can't even speak."
12009,"Oh I see.  She's too young.  ಠ_ಠ

(jk)"
12010,"To not be a father for the dayNo, I change that to a nose hair trimmer."
12011,Hot moist Legal pussy.
12012,"my ex got me something like [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/126406337/leather-nameplate-bracelet?ref=sr_gallery_29&ga_search_query=bracelet+nameplate&ga_ship_to=US&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery) with ""____'s DAD"" on the nameplate. 



the bracelet was way too small for my wrist, but the idea was good. i would imagine any dad would like something similar in idea."
12013,"Also, as new parents with a five week old, what the heck can I do for him. 

I know bj, cook for him, etc. But, I kinda already do stuff like that for him a lot."
12014,"This year is my husband's first father's day too! My ideas so far are a book of dad jokes and one of those cheesy ""#1 DAD"" mugs with our daughter's footprints on it. :) She's too young to make him anything but I still wanted it to be special (and every dad needs a super cool mug haha)."
12015,"He does love his dad jokes! 

I think he might kill me if I get a mug because he says we have too many. I like collecting them. 

I've thought about just leaving him alone and getting him some beers."
12016,"Nice weather, a BBQ and a beer and happy kids."
12017,"Therapeutic massage, double blowjob, bathrobe, a big steak with a bottle of wine, to play video games all day, an LSD trip...

I don't ask for much."
12019,Daddy
12020,An abortion.
12021,Too bad your mother didn't
12022,It was a joke. I guess Reddit doesn't like dark humor?
12024,"What I love about gifts like that is that while you got something useful, you also affirm that someone, sometime, listens to your rants"
12025,"Man those kind of gifts can just destroy me emotionally. When I was younger I was a real nerd and I would help my classmates study because I just had a really good time making study packs and explaining what they needed to know and I felt like it also helped me study. I had a couple friends who really needed some help and I spent ages with them studying for their test.

One of the girls invited me over to hers to hang out so we got in the car but she said we needed to drop something off at the other girls house. She opened the door and they both just turned to me and said OK so we lied we just really wanted to give you this and she handed me a Xena warrior princess box set which I didn't even know they remembered I liked. Instantly started crying at the gesture, it was such a pretty box, too. Thing is I was also looking to buy it but I couldn't find it cheap enough to ship where I was! I'm still friends with those girls a decade later."
12026,That's really sweet. Glad you found such great friends.
12027,I love practical gifts. My gf got me a claw on a pole for picking up trash in the neighborhood for Christmas. It's perfect.
12028,"my coworker was gifted (during Christmas) a usb iPhone cord that was Christmas lights (green cord with acorn shaped colorful lights, looked like someone chopped it off their annoying neighbors decorative collection) 

it's March and she still uses it. it's awesome, such a quality gift! just keeps giving."
12029,"When I told my girlfriend that I was going to start biking to work, she talked her dad into giving up his bike (which he can't ride anymore due to knee problems). It is a 30 year old 10-speed, and she worked with her roommate who works in a bike shop to get it restored. She gave it to me for my birthday and I was totally floored by the amount of effort and thought that went into it. Total home run."
12030,she is a keeper
12031,"Why? He already got the bike.

Time to move on to the girl with the dad that collects classic cars."
12032,Her dad does collect classic cars. So does she!
12033,She's *definitely* a keeper.
12034,Until he gets the car. Then it's time to move on to the girl with the dad that collects mansions.
12035,Her dad does collect mansions. So does she!
12036,She's ***definitely*** a keeper.
12037,Until he gets the mansions. Then it's time to move on to the girl with the dad that collects private jets.
12038,just find a girl whose dad collects collections.
12039,Her dad does collect private jets. So does she!
12040,"A nerd was walking down the sidewalk one day when his friend, another nerd, rode up on an incredible shiny new bicycle.

The first nerd was stunned by his friend's sweet ride and asked, ""WOW! Where did you get such a nice bike?""

The second nerd replied, ""Well, yesterday I was walking home, minding my own business, when a beautiful woman rode up to me on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, 'Take what you want!'""

The second nerd nodded approvingly, ""Good choice. The clothes probably wouldn't have fit."""
12041,I know the joke as about two engineers.
12042,"So yeah, nerds. 

Source: future engineer"
12043,"Can confirm. 

Source: Current Engineer"
12044,"Ah, so you're an electrical engineer? 

*ba dum ts*"
12045,"I gave my boyfriend a bike for his birthday, a second hand one, and a gift-card to Canadian Tire so he could upgrade it & stuff. He tells me pretty often how it was the greatest gift he's ever got. As a student, he was able to bike to school everyday and to work every weekend :) Now, we both go on bike rides nearly everyday in the spring-fall!"
12046,"As a dad with two toddlers. The best gift my in-laws (or parents) could give would be to watch my kids for 4 hours. 

So i can have sex with my wife for 4 hours.

Thats it."
12047,...so you can have another kid?
12049,"You see how this could be a vicious circle, right?"
31539,Yup.
12051,"Coffee is great.

My mom got me a subscription to a small roaster in California. Now every few weeks a bag of some single origin coffee shows up on my doorstep, and it's *delicious*. 

I've straight up told her not to bother with any other gifts. Just get me that for the rest of my life."
12052,Name of the company by chance? I live on the east coast but that sounds like an awesome idea
12053,"Blue Bottle Coffee.

I'm not sure if they're really ""small"" anymore. It looks like they're trying to expand pretty rapidly around the globe."
12054,"They haven't been small for a good long time. They're not exactly a superconglomerate or anything, but they've been one of the largest specialty coffee roasters in the US for close to a decade. Pretty decent stuff! It's certainly been interesting to watch their growth and direction over the last couple years."
12055,A bobblehead of myself.
12056,I would also like a bobblehead of mr_boomboom
12057,"Well, you're in luck, I happen to have quite the collection"
12058,Did it used to belong to your father-in-law?
12059,http://www.bobbleheads.com/
12061,Oh my god. I am extremely buying this.
12063,"I can't be arsed to make the video, but basically it's just me buying it while making guttural sounds of enthusiasm.

In the 90's, however, it would have meant buying it while riding a skateboard."
12064,"The 90s were such a simpler time. These days you'd have about 12 gopro's strapped to you, jump out of a plane with a mouthful of cinnamon while powering up a mobile device, do a bunch of flips trying to get better wifi signal, then once the big moment of you clicking that giant ""confirm order""button hits, you flash to white, then slowly fade back in to the increasing sounds of screams as you fall from the sky, having forgotten your 'chute, only to land safely on an ironically posed goat, have the mobile device land perfectly in one hand, your bobblehead in the other, and lashings of cash and boobs raining down as though you've just won some overhyped talent show.
.
.
fuck I miss my skateboard."
12065,"I got one for a coworker friend of mine who retired.

It was $125 normally and for another $25, they were able to customize it more to the pic and include his work shirt and glasses.

This was like 10 years ago so there's probably a lot more companies with 3D printers cranking these things out."
12066,"So... Fun fact, you can use an XBox Kinect to scan your own head, then using some software, you can make a 3d model that you can send to a 3d printer, and make your own bobble head!

I did it for a golf tournament at work... made bobble heads out of management... I don't know if i actually remember what software I ended up using to scan the heads...

\*edit* ReconstructMe is the software that i used."
12067,"Alright there, Dwight."
12068,"I got a custom bobblehead of me and my SO, from what looked to be a reputable website. It cams a month late, looking like total shit. Never again."
12069,Which website?
12070,www.shittybobbleheads.com
12071,"i have dry hands, always have.  I have recently started dating a new girl and she noticed my dry hands and bought me a really nice lotion for hand repair for no reason, just to be nice.  Things like that matter more than most girls realize."
12072,"Try o'keefes hand lotion, it's the best for dry and cracked hands, it's not that cheap but it works."
12073,"Socks, man. Fuck your oldspice shaving cream, girl, buy me some sweet socks."
12074,"TIL I should give my BF a blowjob and then leave for the day as a gift. 

Edit: Thanks for the Gold! For the record, my SO is looking forward to the next gift-giving occasion, where everything is the same except I have to go sit at McDonalds and drink coffee for six hours."
12075,You forgot to leave cash on the dresser.
12076,"Like some kind of reverse prostitute, or just a regular prostitute I guess."
12077,I think technically that would make him the prostitute.
12078,"Best prostitute ever, getting paid to receive a blowjob. Hell, sign me up!"
12079,"I believe this is an actual viable thing, if you don't mind a little moustache in your blowjob."
12080,"Sir, there is a mustache in my blowjob!"
12081,I know it sounds crass but that would actually be a pretty sweet gift.  Time is the only thing that truly has value.  The time to be himself without outside responsibility is golden.
12082,and the Bejeezer too
12083,Upvote for best new way to say blowjob I've heard since middle school
12084,Gifts that are related to ME not my sex.
12085,"I never understood the idea of buying by the sex. I always by by that person's interests or likes. My brother's gf(s) routinely buy me (female) makeup or body works stuff. Since my skin is extremely sensitive, I cannot use 90% of products. I once broke out in hives from hand lotion."
12086,I read that as girls that are related to me and was concerned.
12087,"If their butt looks good in our genes, I might as well! (Ew.)"
12088,"Exactly. If a guy is really into shaving (I don't know why someone would be really into shaving, but to each his own) get him shaving stuff. If he really likes playing the guitar, get him guitar stuff. If he likes sci-fi, get him sci-fi schwag. If he likes knick-knacks and figures, get him knick-knacks and figurines.

Pretty much the best gift for anyone is something they like.

*Edit:* Based on the responses, guys really hate when you buy them things for their hobby. It turns out they really just want shaving shit.

^(I hope no one in my life reads this thread and just gets me shaving shit for the rest of my life.)"
12089,"I would say not to do this. Here's the reason and some examples.

If someone is really into something, there's probably a very specific item that they want. Depending on what it is that they're ""into"" there may be different products out there with varying levels of quality. Best to leave it to the expert to figure out what they want in this case.

Example: my brothers and I like to play disc golf. My aunt and uncle know this and got us all some discs at Target or Walmart or something. I really appreciate the thought, but those discs sit in my bedroom unused and will likely never ever get used. They are cheap, very lightweight discs that would probably break the first time they hit a tree. 

Example 2: my fiancée knows I love the guitar. She asked me once for my birthday what *specifically* I wanted that I didn't have and I told her ""a good noise gate"". She had no idea what that meant but she was able to go to a guitar store and ask the professionals there. Yes it was guitar center but she ended up getting me an ISP Decimator which is pretty much exactly what I wanted.

So my point is if someone is ""into"" something don't just guess at what they want. They probably have special tastes or very specific preferences."
12090,"Precisely. There are a few things that I am super into, but hate for people to buy for me. They mean well, but if I don't own that item already, there's a reason. Either that or I already own it. I return a lot of Christmas gifts due to already owning the thing the person bought me. At least they know what I like?"
12091,"So there are ways to go about it without asking them directly - usually it involves both thought and splurging. If you're going to buy something hobby-related, you want to shell out extra money otherwise they will probably already have whatever it is. 

For instance, I had a leather guitar strap custom made for my guy. He is a huge Led Zeppelin fan so I had LZ quotes tooled into it along with his own symbol. He said it was the best gift he had ever received.

12092,">i dont know why someone would be really into shaving

you'd be surprised - /r/wicked_edge"
12093,"I know people *are*, I just don't know *why*."
12094,"I got into it because of the cost.  I bought a bulk order of Feather razors five years ago for thirty bucks and it's just now running out.  So now that I'm not spending fifteen-twenty bucks a month on cartridges, I can splurge a little on a nice brush and cream.

It's a nice feeling to have a twenty minute block of contemplative time in which you are applying a skill to pamper yourself.  It's almost like meditating and you look better at the end of it."
12095,">It's a nice feeling to have a twenty minute block of contemplative time in which you are applying a skill to pamper yourself. It's almost like meditating and you look better at the end of it.  
  
This is exactly the appeal I find in putting on makeup everyday."
12096,I don't agree with this one. If somebody is really into something and you're not it makes it difficult unless you know them very well and what they have or are looking for themselves.
12097,"I always say the best gift is something that I want, but wouldn't buy for myself.  So booze isn't necessarily bad.  I like good whiskey, but it's rare that I want to drop $50-70 on a decent bottle of it.  I'd love for someone to do that for me."
12098,"Q: Beside booze what would you want?

A: Booze"
12099,Expensive booze.
39879,This guy gets it
12101,"So an Irish guy picks up this old lamp and proceeded to wipe away the tarnish on it. Out comes a genie and says that he may have three wishes. The man thought for a second and asks for an eternally re-filling bottle of the world's best beer. The genie complies and the man drinks the bottle almost instantaneously. The genie asks for his two other wishes and the Irishman replies, get me  two more bottles of that same beer."
12102,"This. My husband is inherently cheap (byproduct of his upbringing) so when I know he'll like/can use something, I'll buy him the top of the line. His reactions are priceless & make my day. Strategic Bonus: I often benefit from the cool stuff too & now he's ruined on cheaper versions so he *has* to buy good stuff next time. Win/win."
12103,"Exactly.  I'm pretty cheap in most cases, too.  We can afford to buy a great bottle of bourbon sometimes, but I just can't bring myself to do it. But I'd still love to get one sometimes."
12104,"I find buying a bottle of good stuff, and savouring it over a long while isn't actually that expensive over the long run, and also tends to lead to healthier drinking habits.

As a gift to myself on a special occasion I spent $50 on a pint sized bottle of imported whiskey.  I savoured it, and it lasted me a year.  In the meantime I went through a couple other bottles of various quality whiskeys, but when I felt like wanted/deserved something special, I had a single glass of the special whiskey.  I don't know that it was necessarily 'better' for being expensive, but it did make me slow down and enjoy it, and not just drink to get a buzz.

I think enjoying it this way really helped me pick out dis distinctive flavours between various whiskeys, and I don't think that it really that expensive in the long run for the enjoyment I got."
12105,"I get a lot of whiskey gifts from people whose whiskey knowledge is limited to the fact that I like whiskey.

I'm not too big on scotch. I currently have full bottles of laphroaig and honey flavored jack daniels. :/ 

**Edit:** For those of you interested in said bottles, you can have my whiskey, but only if you come to Santa Barbara, California and drink it with me."
12106,So about that Laphroaig...you happen to live in Chicagoland? I'd be happy to take it off your hands.
12107,"Man, no one believes me that ""Chicagoland"" is the actual term. I'm so glad I'm not alone."
12108,"""What is a Lombard?"""
12109,LOMBARD - Lots Of Money But A Real Dickhead
12110,"It's 100% real.  I mean, the full term is ""the Chicagoland area,"" but Chicagoland is close enough."
12111,"I always tell people, get me experiences, not stuff. Arrange a camping trip, super fun. Plan a sweet ass pub crawl. Invite me over to dinner and music at your place. 

I'm an adult and buy the things I want/need. If i don't have it but want it then it is almost certainly out of your price range,which is why I haven't purchased it yet. My tastes are specific, so even if you do think... I'll get him this tool/gadget/item, chances are I won't use it because I want the other one, the one that was twice as expensive as the one you got, the one that was on the shelf next to the one you bought but didn't want to spend the money on, the one that has the eclectic feature that I'll never use but must have.

If you absolutely must get something, and cash is not your thing make a donation in my name to charity, seriously I don't need more stuff."
12112,"Yeah, I'm a single guy with a pretty good job, so pretty much anything I want I can afford; if I can't afford it, I'd not be comfortable with someone else buying it for me instead. But I love getting knick-knacks and desk ornaments and stuff like that, things people buy when they're on trips or at flea markets or what-have-you that I wouldn't be able to find on my own."
12113,"I'm female, but this is me. I have a pile of nice scarves and jewelry-- some of it expensive-- just sitting in a dresser drawer, because it's not really my taste. People always say ""let me know if you don't like it"" but when my aunt hands me the fancy bracelet she bought on her trip to Italy I'm not gonna be like ""yo, fuck this!"" 

On the other hand I have a ton of kitschy bobble heads and bottle openers and mugs  that people have given me here and there, and I love them all."
12114,SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING TO BE SINGLE FOR LONG!
12115,"I agree.

It's especially hard for me, now that I am a parent, to go out and do things as often as I used to. I know it can be daunting because people don't want to interrupt my routine or feel like they are taking me from my family, but giving me an experience as a present is great. It's good to switch things up every now and then."
12116,"My most memorable birthday was my 21st birthday.  Not because I got shitfaced, but because I went kayaking with my best friend.  We did drink, and being able to walk into the grocerie store and buy my own beer was great.  We didn't even go that far, just up the road from his house and down the river that fed into a lake, but it was a beautiful day.  Just him, me, a few beers, and mother nature.  Never going to forget that one, it was just so simple, so great."
12117,"I swear I'm going to impose a hard moratorium on gift buying for me because I'm exactly the same way. My mom will buy me clothes under the presumption of ""you can exchange it if you don't like it or it doesn't fit"" but that's a whole ordeal unto itself that I don't want to deal with in the first place. Same goes for useless knickknacks that clutter up my shit. Give me cash or nothing at all--I already know I'm picky as fuck.

Though if you want to gift me something, gift me cigars. I like those."
12119,It's an experience!
12120,"I'm the same way with the cigars.  I love cigars.  I keep a running Wish List on the Cigars International website and all of my friends and family know to visit the list if they want to buy me something.  I also keep a Wish List on an art supplies website for other friends and family that ""don't wanna help me kill"" myself.  LOL"
12121,"Idc if it's not manly, if someone got my an edible arrangement I would eat that shit for days."
12122,"Yes, we know how an edible arrangement works"
12123,"I asked for one once. Got it.

Ate for days.

No ragrats."
12125,(つ ツ )つ
12126,Kirby
12127,You alright dude?
12128,"Yes, just been a very long time since I had one. Thanks for asking though."
12129,I like...eh...I like booze
12130,"Shit, you know much money I spend on booze? I could use a free one every now and then. And what's with bars not buying me a round?"
12131,Have you tried being a hot girl? They tend to get lots of free drinks at bars.
12134,Get dad a hooker

^the ^tables ^have ^turned"
12138,"I'm really surprised by how many times I open these threads and find that what men really want on ""special days"" is just to be left alone."
12139,"I can't speak for everyone, but for me being left alone isn't about not wanting to be with my family or friends. It's about being free knowing that I don't have to consider in any way what they want to do, what they have planned, what they have in mind, how anything makes them feel, or whether or not they need or want any particular thing at a particular time. I can sleep when I'm sleepy, eat when I'm hungry and not have to think more than 10 minutes into the future unless I really want to.

It's not completely about being alone, it's about being free of consideration and compromise for a day."
12140,"This is what i have started doing on my birthday.  I figure out exactly what I want to do and email my friends and say ""let me know if you wanna join and what parts you want to join for"".

Last year I got an early dinner of German food then went to see a movie and was in bed by 10pm.  Thats a great day to me."
12141,How many friends joined you for getting in bed?
12143,This is a articulate outline of why (guilt-free) alone time is important for anybody.
12144,That's only because no-one ever listens.
12145,"When my girlfriend always wanted to be with me, yeah being left alone is what I wanted. She didn't have her own hobbies.

My wife has her own hobbies and interests. I can do my stuff whenever I want. I'd like a day with her, away from the pets, with money she saved up herself so that don't worry about it. Finishing it up with her initiating sex and some t.v/movie afterwards (and maybe interupted by more sex)"
12146,"If you have children you will find that both of you just want time to be yourself.  My wife has an active social life and a number of hobbies/interests.  I would much rather relax by myself and work on my car or play some video games.  Once we had the little guy, everything requires careful scheduling and planning.  The little man is awesome and I wouldn't trade him for anything but the spontaneity of life is definitely diminished."
12147,"Girls without hobbies are huge red flags for this very reason. YOU become their hobby.

And if I'm totally honest with myself, I'm kind of fucking boring. So you want me to be your entertainment and fun, but I don't want to do any of that.

My wife also has her own interests and hobbies. If I say ""I want to play some video games..."" she says ""Okay, good, because I want to binge watch this entire season of Dowton Abby."" It's literally wonderful.

Sadly, she shot down my idea of having two TVs in the living room where I could game with headphones on while still sitting next to her. ...*sigh* someday, maybe..."
12148,"Most of my boyfriend's video game collection is on consoles. Most of mine is on PC.

We sit in the living room for hours doing our own thing, sometimes going 5 or 6 hours on weekends without even speaking a word to one another.

Then every once in awhile he'll lift his head up and say: ""love?"" To reassure that we're still dating, to which I'll reply ""love.""

It's pretty rad. Dates and sex are frequent enough that I'm not concerned this is a bad thing. Our friends all say we're already married."
12149,"My birthday is tomorrow and to prevent people from harrassing me, i turn my phone off, delete my facebook/other forms of social media and do nothing for the day. I havent ""celebrated"" my birthday since high school, and i intend to keep it that way."
12150,"I'm very similar, I can get through most years without any coworkers finding out its my birthday, it's great."
12151,"Peace and quiet for like 4 hours. If I can buy it, I don't want it as a gift. Just leave me alone for half a day and let me lay down on this couch, watch some TV and don't bother me. That's really all I want."
12152,I'll assume you have kids ;)
12155,"concert tickets.  This is too underrated for me.  I love going to shows.  Beer, music, boobies.  What guy doesn't like that?"
12156,I can offer you boobies and that's about it.

12159,"Cash.

Look I know it's considered tacky, but don't try and surprise me with things if you have no idea what I want."
12160,I have never understood the taboo on cash gifts; they are the best.
12161,"Well, when you share money (i.e. married or living together), it's stupid to give them money. ""Here, have some of your own money. Happy birthday from yourself."""
12162,"Idk, speaking as a married man with kids, having some of my own money would be pretty fucking sweet."
12163,"It's because (to a lot of people at least) part of the point of a gift is to prove that you understand the recipient enough to get them something that they really want without talking to them about it first. It's a test of closeness and understanding. Giving cash is just saying ""I refuse to participate in your ritual"". And opting out of social rituals is always off-putting to participants."
12164,"""I understand that you like money"""
12165,"""I understand that you NEED money"""
12166,">I refuse to participate in your ritual.

This is now my go-to on all handmade cards."
12167,This sounds like something Ron Swanson would do
12168,And how the fuck is a gift card any better than cash? Its like you decided to give me $18.59 instead of $20 and the rest of the money is a gift to target or some bullshit
12169,"You may be being rhetorical. But in case you're not, it's the whole ""thought that counts"" thing. The implication is if I get you cash I'm saying ""I have no clue what to get you."" But if I know you love antiques and I get you a gift card to the local antique gallery. Then I'm saying ""I know you well enough to know you like antiques and will love this present."" Or (for a real life example), I know my fiancée needed new makeup but I also knew I had no fucking clue what to get. So I got her a Sephora gift card. She was able to get exactly what she wanted anyway, and there was an added bonus of showing I can pay attention to her and pick up on things she may need as a gift."
12170,"The danger lies here:

My wife and I like cooking. When we got married, three people gave us gift cards to Williams-Sonoma. Great. There's stuff there that we wanted, but it was all 30-50% more expensive than from Amazon or something. You've just devalued the money you gave us, and limited our selection. I felt bad spending more of the generously-given money that I had to because it was tied to a single store."
12171,"You know you can use the remaining balance on another purchase, right?"
12172,I usually just make a slightly larger purchase and enjoy shelling out $1.37 for a video game I've been wanting.
12173,"Probably a social thing. As mentioned, most guys don't want you to buy them anything unless you know that they want it. Giving them cash is a weird admission of not really knowing/caring enough. Again, most people won't care, but that's how I feel when I give someone cash."
12174,"The problem with cash gifts is that if your family/friend group becomes too static it starts seeming silly. 

I have a friend I swap gifts with every xmas (always booze), if we just started handing each other $40 it would be silly.


Cash gifts are best for relationships that are asymmetrical -- my parents will likely always give me nicer things than I give them, so for them to give me cash makes sense.


My wife and I should not exchange cash every valentines day."
12175,"You, the recipient, lose something this way though. Imagine that you wanted something expensive for your birthday...something that you wouldn't normally purchase for yourself because it was so expensive. Now, picture someone buying it for you (or several people going in together) and you get it...super exciting...you have this thing that you would have NEVER purchased.

Now, picture those same people going in together and giving you the money to buy it yourself. Economists have found that the person who received the cash is actually LESS LIKELY to purchase the item the cash was intended for...because once they have the cash in hand they rationally don't want to spend that much on something (just like before...when you wouldn't want to buy it yourself)...you want to pay your bills or something else.

Cash is awesome...don't get me wrong. But there is a benefit to an actual gift."
12176,"I totally agree with this. But I'd still rather get cash than a gift card! Basically:

gift > cash > gift card"
12177,"Yeah, I still want cash."
12178,Please don't buy me gifts. They clutter up my space but I feel bad about throwing them away.
12179,"Circuit boards. Like, raspberry pis and arduino and such.  

Little remote helicopters.  

Fluffy shit, like microfiber blankets and such.  

Art."
12180,"My wife bought me an extended range USB wifi adapter with an 18 db antenna for my... Research regarding neighbors and their wifi.

I love tech gadgets.

But, being a parent, I actually take the most enjoyment in buying my wife and kids gifts they like.  With my wife I will often surprise her with something she talked about sometime in the last year, but we could not really afford at the time.  So this is what I really recommend, just see what he does, listen to things he said might be handy or cool and buy that."
12181,I feel you on that fluffy shit. My girlfriend got me a pair of plush llamas for Christmas and I ~~squealed~~ politely thanked her for such a thoughtful gift.
12182,"Whatever it is, I don't want a ""to you for us"" gift. Or worse, the ""I think you need this"" gift that turns out to be a tool for a project your SO wants you to do."
12183,"All the things I want are over $500.00 and if you can't afford that then I'd rather you just give me cash to help toward those things. 

Or

If you're the type of person I'm willing to accept gifts from, I'd rather you just gave me your time, find some activity for us to do together or buy me dinner, just as long as we can spend a few hours together. 

Fuck giftcards. 

EDIT: Thank you for the Gold, this is also now my top all time comment."
12184,"> If you're the type of person I'm willing to accept gifts from

Do you often say to people 'You're not someone I am willing to accept a gift from'?"
12185,"""take that gift away, peasant. you are not good enough for me."""
12186,"> Fuck giftcards.

They sell gift cards for fucks?  I'll take yours if you don't want them."
12189,I really like getting books as gifts
12190,Books are a nice gift. Especially if the person giving it read and loved the book. It's like I enjoyed this story so much that I want to share it with you.
12191,"A nice pocket knife or leatherman, books, candy, beef jerky, a large amount of cashews/pistachios, gadgets, remote control anything."
12192,Jerky is very under-rated as a gift
12193,A gift card to massage therapy gives me joy.
12194,Lets be real here ... we all want LEGOs.
12195,"I'm a Lego collector. I have a Lego room in my apartment. I've spend over $25k in the past 4 years on Lego. My mom asks;
""What do you want for Xmas, you're so hard to shop for""  
""Same thing I've always wanted. Lego.""  
""But you have all the Legos (it's not LegoS, it's Lego, but whatever) you want.""  
""There's no such thing. Even if I already have the set, I'll gladly take two.""  
*Cut to Christmas*  
""I got you these Legos (grr) from a truck stop. Look, they light up!""  
I smile, holding a box of what is obviously not Lego. ""Thanks Mom."""
12196,"Look, I will fully admit that this is a first world problem that I had in the 1970s. I am not proud that this sticks in my brain as being annoying. But your post really hit a nerve that I remember from my childhood where my mother just really couldn't remember what I had asked for. She never wrote it down. I mean, I know this for what it is: just a childlike misunderstanding of what's important to adults. It's disrespectful on my part to still be carrying this mental baggage.

But she drove herself crazy asking for the wrong Lego set at the toy store. She often came back with the wrong Lego. Sometime she didn't even have a Lego at all, almost implying that I had asked for something that did not exist.

One example was the classic 483, ""ALPHA-1 ROCKET BASE."" Now as an adult I get that that's a bunch of nonsense word strung together, especially to a suburban housewife in the late 1970s. You have a Greek letter, followed by a number, followed by a noun that has a scifi concept in it, and a generic noun which could be replaced by a variety of generic nouns. Because she did not write things down, she would go to Sullivans toy store in the local mall, and ask for something like, ""Alfalfa One, Spaceship plaza."" Or something to that effect. Sometimes she just made up entirely new sentences, like, ""Happy starship astronaut face.""

And then on Christmas Day, I would open up a present that was completely unexpected, probably because my mom shouted out some sort of nonsense that had to been decoded by the toy store manager. In fact, I bet that happened to that manager a lot from multiple suburban mothers of the era. I can imagine one Micronauts were popular, that created all kinds of problems. The only reason I got into Micronauts was because my mother accidentally bought them when I asked for Legos. This is not a complaint. So when I opened up the gift on Christmas day, sometimes I would be forced to look at a generic astronaut action figure. Maybe it was a bag full of alien finger puppets.  Once it was a Nerf toy that was a tank that had rockets that would shoot off of a tube. And it was extremely frustrating, even when I would go to the toy store with her and point to the actual box. ""This one. I want this one.""

Sometimes she remembered the Lego. We didn't have Megablocks back then, those came when I was a teenager and some of my friends younger siblings ended up with those horrible ripoffs. But I would get a set that I already owned, or was not related to what I asked. And then I would have to fake being happy about it, which only reinforced this behavior, and I felt very frustrated by the whole thing.

I mean, sometimes she got it right. So it was kind of a crapshoot. But that one alpha-1 base? I ended up saving up money and buying it myself.

Ugh, is a very embarrassing confession. And I really hope I drop it after I post this."
12197,"I remember being a little shit when I was asked what I wanted for Christmas one year and I said ""Scalextric""..come christmas day, super excited, open a big box...and it's not Scalextric. It's a track racing game, sure, but it runs off Batteries and the cars are not F1 cars and i try to be nice to my parents but they can tell I'm not that impressed. 

It was till later on that day I realised that they couldn't afford the 'brand name' thing, so they got me what they could afford. So I made a point of playing with it a lot, making out like it was the best thing ever, just so they didn't feel bad."
12198,"If this situation comes up if I have kids, I'm just going to tell them we can't afford that. The amount of weird shit and disappointment adults will put on their kids in order to not tell them that they're struggling financially or even just on a budget blows my mind. 

If my mom had told me ""you girls didn't get new bikes this year because we can't afford it"" I would have completely understood, but instead I had to labor under the notion that they hadn't realized we'd both grown 6 inches and were ok with us bouncing our knees off the handlebars, because anytime the question came up they'd just breeze straight past it instead of being honest with us."
12199,"my parents generally did tell me if they couldn't afford stuff, but i think on this occasion they didn't realise that what they had bought wasn't the same as what I'd asked for - to them there was no difference, and it was cheaper. That's why I felt bad later on - even when i was young (think I'd have been 8 or 9 for this) I was aware that we didn't have as much as other families. e.g. all my friends would go on holiday somewhere, and we never did. 

Plus, I'm sure telling your child that you can't do something for them is a bit of a downer (I don't have kids myself). There were times when things were made apparent simply because there was no alternative (when I was 13 there was a school trip to Egypt and there was no way they could've afforded that)."
12200,"My grandmom used to be like that. Eventually, I realized she remembered, but it was too expensive, so she got me something similar to what I asked for instead. Now that I'm older, I realize that little me was an ass who didn't realize that my family wasn't that well-off to be able to afford $20 legoes.

Not sure if your mum was like that, but just wanted to share in case this was so."
12201,The gift of reddit gold.
12202,"not today, chief"
12203,I did it out of spite... suck it.
12204,"whether you gilded or not, you made me laugh. Gold for you"
12205,"It was me, and thanks for the gold, mine was almost up and I was about to renew mine. You can have it instead.

Edit: Thanks /u/observantguy!"
12206,"Thank you, /u/HappyHashBrowns!

Your spite fills me with pleasure."
12207,"Give me a day where I don't have to worry about anyone but myself. I'm tired of watching my actions and second guessing everyone's reactions. I just want to bust up some games or whatnot, smoke a doobie, drink a few beers and not have to worry that my introversion is considered rude or unfriendly."
12208,"gadets,

giftcards to stores I like,

stuff for my hobbies - like photography stuff, art stuff, etc.

I actually love getting socks and boxers bc I hate spending money on them."
12209,I actually love clothes because I hate even spending time shopping for them.  Amazon has helped some of that but not all of it.
12210,"I'm a thirty five year old dude, and I will be fucking stoked by a Lego kit or a Nerf/BoomCo blaster."
12211,I will literally show up at my friends house unannounced just to have nerf gun wars with his kids.  Which is awesome cus thats like an hour where they can actually get shit done
12212,ITT: Different men like different gifts.
12213,No way.
12214,"And to think I went my whole life up until now thinking that men were some monolithic group with all of the exact same interests and desires.

This has really opened my eyes."
12215,"I will tell you what I *don't* want:  I don't want a damned card.  I feel obligated to read it and come up with some kind of response that will make you think I like it.  I don't.  Cards are a complete waste.  If you want to write me a letter, go ahead.  Don't buy me a card."
12216,"A blowjob. Like that's it, just one. And not the foreplay blowjob that gets me halfway there before intercourse. I mean a to-completion blowjob. Save your money, clear that reservation, I don't even need a card."
12217,Yeah...I can't remember I got a full blowjob from start to finish.  I always get the start and then the finish...but not the journey
12218,Y'all need to talk to your girls more
12219,Any type of computer part or electronics. I'm a tinkerer so I like things to build with. Even raspberry pi is a cool gift so I can make it do something fun
12220,Silence

12222,"Books, I never seem to get any now unless i specifically ask for it, and are a lot more useful than most stuff given, although usually the deodorant given means i only have to buy it for about half of the year."
12223,"If you are older, then spending some time with them and talking  or helping them out would seriously mean the world to them.You can also try making them something that reminds them of you or a picture of your family in a new frame. 

Fathers really appreciate anything from their children as momentos since they may not be around them all the time in the future"
12224,Agreed. Offer to go fishing with him.
12225,Spending time with parents is also a good idea.
12226,Something you made.
12227,Something..something..kids
12228,What that means ??
12229,It means that you marry somebody and umm..make a..baby or babies...with them. So you can give them to your father as grandkids. Or not
12230,Yes you are right.
12231,Like what ?
12232,Grand children
12233,Hahaha
12234,"Anything that relates to your relationship with him that you can’t buy in a store. 

Something that you made like a painting, or a handwritten note, a picture that is prized by you both framed."
12235,"So true. My dad loves this stuff. I decorated a couple of shirts as gifts once and they looked *horrible*, but you bet your ass my dad wore those shirts proudly out in public. I love dads."
12236,"my dad is this goofy ass mega straight edge asian dude who'd fuck a random kid up at walmart if the kid was acting up.

so on his birthday, i always spend a bunch of money bam margera-ing him into doing shit like going to the humane society, or bringing a petting zoo to his house."
12237,My dad introduced me to Quentin Tarantino films and we would watch them all the time together. I got him a Tarantino Blu Ray collection. I always try to get something materialistic with a story behind it
12238,That sounds good
12240,Good idea
12241,"Very few fathers really want a tie. If he normally wears them, ties are a part of his style. Let him pick his own."
12242,He might like to have track suit instead tie.
12243,"A hand made photo album filled with pictures of all the favorite moments that you shared with him or family, with handwritten captions. I made one for Father's Day this year and he was wild about my gift. He keeps it in his locked safe because he said it's one of the most valuable possessions he's ever received - memories, locked away for safekeeping."
12244,Cool idea
12245,"Similar to this, one year I gave dad a personalized calendar with pictures of him and mom when they were young, the family over time, etc, and added important family dates like birthdays to it"

12250,Not possible
12252,So cute. I wish i could do that also.
12253,Spend time with him. It doesn't need to be a physical gift. Make the most of your time together - it will be gone sooner than you think.
12254,"This is my go-to for both my parents. They're well off enough and if there's something specific they want, they just get it themselves anyway. So I always make sure I come by and make them a nice dinner, bring a bottle of wine and just have a great time together."
12255,Upvoted because atm im settin here hanging with my pops at the VA gettin his chemo.
12256,"While I can appreciate that this is what a lot of fathers would like, I want the opposite.  I spend everyday with my kids doing all the little things like baths, playing, and generally spending time with them.  So, every father's day, and my birthday, I always ask for my wife to take them somewhere for the day so I can have the house to myself.  A day with peace and quiet is the best."
12257,Beer. Give him his favorite beer.
12258,"I spent a while building up a collection of beer, picking a couple of bottles here and there over time and gave it to him. I thought it was a good present even if he didn't."
12259,"As a father i can tell you this. 

Time. Spend some time with me. Lets go mountain biking or swimming. We could even just go out for a burger and movie. Tell me how you are doing,what your dreams for the future are."
12260,"I do a grilling basket for my dad every year. Charcoal, marinade, BBQ sauce, seasonings, wood chunks, lighter fluid, and a 6 or 12 pack. He loves it. Throw in a new set of grilling utensils too if you can afford to do so.

12267,I always thought that was more of a Mother's Day gift???
12268,I'm taking my Dad to a local museum neither of us have ever been to.  It's about an industry a late relative spent his career in and that we both find interesting.  Then we're going for lunch at our favourite hot dog restaurant.  Should be lots of fun for both of us.

12278,Mi band if you want the cheaper (and in some ways better e.g. battery life) equivalent.
12279,Does it have a heart rate monitor?
12280,"No. Step and sleep tracking only (and notifications for your phone if you want those too).

With only step and sleep tracking you can wear it over a month between charges and it's totally waterproof etc though so it's largely wear it and forget it which is it's biggest selling point along with the very low price (20-30 bucks)."
