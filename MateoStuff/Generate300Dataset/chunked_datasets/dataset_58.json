18558,Historia Civilis for the Classical History nerds
18559,"I recommend JunsKitchen if you're into cats and cooking channels (but not cooking cats, that's bad)."
18560,I found Rachel and Jun's channels not too long ago. I mostly watch for the cats.
18561,POKI!
18562,OMG the one where he keeps going into the trash had me rollin.
18563,"[It's Alive!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIunYVkv_S7LqWqRuGw1oz-1zG3dIL4) With Brad, series on Bon Appetit"
18564,"Just add wourdor, badabing bada boom. Allicin."
18565,Hmm that's the stuff Vinny
18566,"You gettin' this, Vin?"
18567,"Aaaand you give it a little BOP, BOP, BOP! That’s how you do it right there! Who’s better than us Vinny???"
18568,My boy Vincenzo over here
18569,We'll head over here to the fermentation station ^choo ^^choo
18570,It's a beautiful thing
18572,"It’s like a uhh, two part epoxy"
18573,I also like their series where they make gourmet versions of foods like Oreos and Twizzlers
18574,"Yeah, I love those too. Sadly, Claire (the woman who makes the gourmet candy) has left BA. she's started her own pastry bakery in Alaska, though, so that's cool.

EDIT: for those of you looking for a source, you can find a blog post mentioning her going away party [here](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/cantaloupe-jelly-for-claire). The Alaska thing is just something I saw in the Twizzlers video, so it's absolutely possible that's not true. I'll update this if I find a source"
18575,That just ruined my day.
18576,Claire is the best!
18577,Bob Appetit is such a good channel!! All their videos from the test kitchen are so entertaining
18578,Just to hear Brad talk about Allicin.
18579,its like a two part epoxy
18580,I think I'm in love with Brad. I just love his enthusiasm!
18581,"Try Defunctland! It's a documentary series about former theme park attractions. Really high production values, and some batshit insane true stories. Micheal Eisner never ceases to fascinate."
18582,"Along those lines, I'd say check out Bright Sun Films. Mainly his ""Abandoned"" series."
18583,*What's up guys*
18584,Love defunctland. Hearing about the rise and fall of amusement parks is very interesting
18585,Internet Comment Etiquette. Erik's pulling off highly incisive commentary these days. Plus it's fucking hilarious. Here's a rocket ship B::::v:::::D~~~ aaaaaaand... post!
18586,ain't no planet x coming cuz ain't no space cuz ain't not globe earth
18587,"I'm big money salvia, king of the pipe
Typin' up comments, all damn night
9/11 inside job click, click
spent 3 fuckin' hours, bouncing on my boys dick"
18588,"Be sure to pick up your copy of ""The Great Salvios Guide to Bouncing on Your Boys Third Eye"""
18589,But it's just a blank journal?
18590,"Erik, is that you?"
18591,/u/TWCreations ONLY YOU CAN READ THIS COMMENT. CEASE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE LEST YOU WISH TO KNOW TRUE PAIN
18592,Big Money Salvia bringing mayhem to the Discord server on his recent Staying Hip video is probably the hardest I've laughed watching YouTube this year.
18593,bounced on my boys dick to this for hours
18594,Sam O'nella. Talks about topics you would never think are interesting/existed
18595,"Hey kids, today we're going to talk about..."
18596,"_insert question no one asked yet is still interesting_

I mean who just wakes up one day and thinks, what was the most destructive non-water flood?"
18597,I do .... Wasn't it molasses?
18598,I think it was the alcohol tidal wave since the people tried to drink it afterwards. Debris and all
18599,"Among those who don't already know the answer, though"
18600,My favorite one of his is the alcoholic some rich guys tried to kill for Insurence fraud... But he just kept coming back!
18601,"If you haven't, you need to listen to the podcast The Dollop's episode on Micheal Malloy. It covers the same stuff but in a longer format. Anyone who likes Sam should check out the podcast as it covers really wacky stuff that has happened in history in a similar vein to his videos."
18602,The Tarrare episode. My god.
18603,"Tarrare, look at me... *Did you eat a *fucking* baby?*"
18604,"Finally, some love for my boy Sammy"
18605,Watch one of his videos and watch your recommended become 100% his videos
18606,well unless you are a dirty... collectivising... COMIE
18607,COMMMMIIEEEEEEEE!!!!!! COMMMIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
18608,The Great War if you are interested in WWI
18609,"Also WW2, since you're only up to the defeat of Poland now, and can follow along in real time"
18610,does the great war do ww2 stuff?
18611,Separate channel but the same guys [Here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1AejCL4DA7jYkZAELRhHQ)
18613,Door Monster is the best! Their videos are hilarious. They just finished filming a pilot for a scifi TV show and are going to be pitching it to Netflix soon.
18614,"Down the Rabbit Hole is the ultimate binge channel, I can never watch just one episode a time.

For those not in the know, it's a documentary channel largely focused on internet history and drama."
18615,Down the Rabbit Hole even introduced me to the most toxic internet community in the world: Youtube comment sections
18616,Terrible Writing Advice is great.
18617,But you know what would make it better? A love triangle!
18618,Don't worry if the characters have no personality- Just make sure to make it dark and brooding! Readers love that!
18619,"Steve1989. Dude is super passionate about military rations. Also for car guys Doug demuro, petrolicious, and seen through glass"
18620,"Nothing like watching a guy with a ponytail smoke a 40 year old pack of cigs... Steve is a legend.


Binging with babish references Steve every time he get something out on a tray. ""Nice."""
18621,"Lets get this out onto a tray!




NICE!"
18622,"You forgot the ubiquitous ""m'kay"". Never have I wanted MREs more than after a vid"
18623,"Starbucks : Hello, how would you like your coffee?

Steve : Instant.

Starbucks : Nice."
18624,Nice hiss!
18625,"""Augh...this smells rancid...no way am I trying that...* brief pause *...oh ok maybe a small bite."""
18626,"Came here to plug Steve. Seriously fascinating and entertaining stuff.

Nice hiss!"
18627,"I've recently found Steve1989 and I love him.

This is Steve1989. I hope you liked the video, and I'll be coming back at you with something new... or old. Alright, cool."
18628,"[PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g) does astronomy and cosmology really well and has content going back to 2015. [PBS Eons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA) is great for evolutionary biology and geology.

[PBS Digital Studios](https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios) has a bunch of other channels that are probably good."
18629,"PBS ST is definitely a build-up series. If you just jumped in at the latest episode and don't have a bachelors+ in physics, you'll be hopeless lost by the jargon. But if you binge the series, even if you don't understand the math involved, they do a great job at teaching you the terms and ideas behind everything."
18630,"Probably said before but I absolutely adore Ashens, his dry british humor is something that not a lot of people around me dig but I personally think he’s hilarious and his voice is usually pretty soft and pretty easy to listen to, and of course I’d be scorned for not mentioning the originator of the “Chef Excellence” meme! He usually reviews crappy Poundland (Dollar Store) items, knock-off/real gaming consoles of interest, and crappy instant food. He’s my go-to sleep playlist!

I should also mention that he has a collaboration channel with some of his friends and they make delightful videos as well, it’s called Barshens. This one’s more of a variety type channel, but still good stuff! I know at least Barry has a channel of his own too where he does more cooking-centric content called My Virgin Kitchen. Give em a try! c:"
18631,"I was looking for someone to mention Barshens! That's in my top five of favourite channels, I love how over time more and more of the crew get involved in front of the camera. They've got hours worth of stuff to binge watch and it's all hilarious."
18632,exurb1a is a really nice channel to watch. he offers tons of insights into the human experience while still remaining funny.
18633,but you get an existential crisis after every video
18634,Sometimes during too *gives thumbs up whilst weeping silently*
18635,"Geography Now! 

Prepare to whistle the theme to yourself for the next 6 months."
18636,"Fuckin love those guys! For those of you that dont know, they are going through every country on earth, big and small, in alphabetical order talking about the people, culture, terrain, attractions and a bit of their history. 
Classic started as one guy and a camera and now has like ~10 people sort of deal."
18637,If you watch it in order you can also observe Barbs becoming increasingly ripped.
18638,It’s time to learn geography!
18639,NOW!
18641,I'm so fucking gay for Noah. Holy shit that dude.
18642,"[Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay) - British guy talking about things you might not know. Also has a few videos on tech and programming

Edit 2: Seeing as you guys seem to like my suggestions here's some more:

[Colin Furze](https://www.youtube.com/user/colinfurze) - Plumber turned backyard mad scientist. If it's got wheels he's probably put a jet engine on it.

[standupmaths](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths) - Aussie maths teacher turned maths comedian.

[ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/user/msadaghd) - Electronics and (un)safety demonstrations. ""FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER"""
18643,Oh man the Wintergatan project is incredible. His passion for the project is so inspiring.
18644,"Lindsay Ellis brought me to Contrapoints, who is just delightful. She's an ex-philosophy professor who makes really well-produced, hilarious, and intelligent video essays on current social issues.

Also

Jenny Nicholson for, as someone else put it, very dry humor nerd movie reviews, 

friendlyjordies for funny dress up and accents with funny commentary on mostly Australian politics, 

and Aunty Donna for fantastic absurdist skits.

And sips, a lovely Canadian man who plays PC games."
18645,"Expanding on Tom Scott, everyone should most definately also watch The Technical Difficulties: Citation Needed. It is Tom and friends' hilarious reverse trivia style show where Tom gives the name of an almost randomly selected Wikipedia article and the rest them have to figure out what it is about. My favorite episode is Jack Churchill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TsEGt841pw"
18646,"8-Bit Guy & Techmoan. Even if you're not interested in vintage computing or audio components, these two are so passionate and have such a laid back way of presenting their knowledge that it's enjoyable."
18647,I love the care and research The 8 Bit Guy puts into good videos. It is really interesting learning about various old computers.
18648,"Came here for these, also, Lazy Game Reviews."
18649,"Down the Rabbit Hole is, in [Fredrik Knudsen's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWcXB0PoqOsAvAdfzWMf0w/featured) own words, ""A series of videos diving deep into those strange parts of the internet as well as confounding and absurd elements of history""

he does an amazing job and you should check out his videos, very informative and entertaining, and a great way to learn about things you probably have never heard of

if you have heard of them, he adds so much more to the videos so there's always something more to learn"
18650,Internet Historian. Very in depth details of events that blew up the Internet.
18651,"His most recent video is on Kony 2012, and released just yesterday. I’d say it’s a pretty good starting point, but really all of his content is quite accessible and enjoyable."
18652,I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I thought Kony 2012 was some sort of joke or failed presidential campaign because of the name
18653,"[TierZoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw). If you haven't heard of him yet. He does information videos about animals as if they were classes on a video game. He goes over stats, skills, strategies, and other things."
18654,Basically the YouTube equivalent of r/outside.
18655,They post his vids there from time to time
18656,There’s a whole sub for r/tierzoo that’s all in character.
18657,"This is just so cool :')

hi everyone, I made that channel. AMA"
18658,Definitely check out Captain Disillusion. Years worth of quality content.
18659,"The captain needs more love, he's been on YT for OVER 10 YEARS, 10 YEARS!!! 
And he has never slumped it's always been high quality high production value content for 10 years straight and he only just reached a million subs!

For the uninformed he basically debunks fake viral videos by showing how the digital effects were done in a very enticing and Bombastic way.
There's also a running story line and recurring characters in his videos. 
It's all very entertaining and educational and helps you spot fake viral videos wayyyy quicker...

Which means you get to be the person who destroys their friends lives by telling them that the thing they enjoyed is a big load of fake!

Yaaaaay!"
18660,He's a masterful VFX artist. He gives lessons in VFX and Skepticism disguised as debunk videos.
18661,"You Suck At Cooking. It's funny, involves cooking, and videos are short. And it's super chill. Just give it a watch."
18662,Just give it some pepper pepper pepper
18663,don't forget to wangjangle everything together
18664,Put the ondoh on three-hundoh
18665,Yeah you totally suck!
18666,Adam Neely if you're a music theory nerd
18667,"Sideways is my personal favourite YouTube music theory channel.

His video titled Why Miyazaki Films Sound Pretty is my favourite music theory video out there."
18668,"Others have mentioned most of these in comments already, but my go-to music-related Youtube channels are [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/user/havic5), [Sideways](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw), [Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch), [12 Tone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUtqcDkzw7bisadh6AOx5w), and [8-bit Music Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZLO2VgbZHeDcongKzzfOw). Getting a bit more niche, I enjoy most of [Samurai Guitarist's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/samuraiguit) and [Jens Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/user/jenslarsen02) does some neat Jazz music stuff. I was pretty big on [Music is Win](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshiNtfJ7Dj3nlh41a6M-kg), [Sean Daniel](https://www.youtube.com/user/seandaniel23), and [YourGuitarSage](https://www.youtube.com/user/yourguitarsage) in the past, but I haven't been keeping up with those three channels lately. Finally, [Dan Erlewine's videos for Stewart MacDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUUuMzxJ9h8) are amazing."
18669,B A S S
18670,Micheael Reeves
18671,"“you see this poster in the background? do you want one of your very own? well too fuckin bad, it’s mine, ya can’t have it.” He’s my favorite build youtuber by a landslide"
18672,Didn't he make a website just for the poster you can't buy?
18673,"[Yep](http://gofuckyourselfitsnotforsale.com/)

Edit: until the 7 oct 2018 it’s available, if you are from the further future then fuck you"
18674,And William Osman
18675,Everyone of his videos lightens up my mood. Even the video of his house burning down he finds a way to see the good and funny in it. I'd love to have a beer with him one day
18676,"They're roommates now, which is weird and cool."
18677,"Casually Explained - relatable topics explained well, casually, Tier Zoo - learning about animals made funny, HalfAsInteresting - random and interesting topics made funny and explained simply"

18683,You could make a religion out of it.
18684,No Don't
18685,First We Feast's Hot Ones is great. Sean interviews various celebrities while they're both eating chicken wings. The sauce on the wings gets hotter as the interview continues.
18686,"That thing is starting to feel more like a legit TV show these days, like something that would be on MTV."
18687,Waaaay more viewers on YouTube than on MTV.
18688,And less corporate oversight.
18689,"He also does vegetarian wings when the guest requests. (which are apparently really good.)   Its not about the Eating Wings, but the interview under an interesting circumstance.

The Alton Brown one is quite a favorite."
18690,Guy Fieri was great. He gets so much criticism but seems like actually just a cool dude that is passionate about good food.
18691,"[Ave.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWv6Pn_zP0rI6lgGt3MyfA)

The [BOLTR](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvgS71fU12Mbx-w18Chu_Sg9v6loipEFO) section consists of reviews of tools that are basically torn apart and dissected. It's oddly addicting and informative at the same time."
18692,"If you like Ave you will probably also like [This Old Tony](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5NO8MgTQKHAWXp6z8Xl7yQ). He is hilarious and makes great videos, mostly about machining and welding."
18693,/r/skookum
18694,Vet Ranch. Makes me happy seeing cute puppies and kittens get all fixed up and sent to a nice home.
18695,"His other channel demolition ranch is good too, as well as his daily vlogs (off the ranch??)"

18707,"[Abroad in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/user/cmbroad44)

British dude moved to Japan, and his channel is a kind of travel documentary for the country. I binge watched a bunch of videos a few weeks back, and it really made me wanna travel to Japan.

The guy has gained some popularity for his tour of [Japanese Love Hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXgX_r-x-XE) and for his video on [teaching Japanese people to swear in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9-OWfS2Vy4). I also found his video on the [Robot Dinosaur Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9DBb-Eng20) to be a pretty good watch."

18716,"100% you need some ""Primitive Technology"" in your life."
18717,"And remember to turn the subtitles on. Since he doesn’t talk, which is part of the attraction for me, he loads the captions up with explanations of what he’s doing. It’s a game changer for the channel."

18724,Alchestbreach. He is a New Vegas and Fallout 4 mod reviewer. He's hilarious and always cheers me up no matter how bad of a day I had. Love the man to death.
18725,"Dragonball Z Abridged. It’s hardly even dragonball. It’s like they took a show that existed and was way too long, shortened it down and dubbed over it, made an entirely new plot that’s better than the original, and made it absolutely hilarious. I watched the entire series three times now, and I never even watched Dragon ball growing up.

EDIT:

He does a lot of commentating on stuff mainly Call Of Duty. Heres his channel http://m.youtube.com/user/VipersClassChannel
18780,"Gotta love the viper.

I prefer his COD plays though.

18800,This one about [galactic superclusters](http://youtu.be/rENyyRwxpHo) simply blows my mind.
18801,"Those kind of space videos just tend to destroy my mind completely because it's just out of our brain's capabilities to actually even get a sense of how unbelievably enormous out universe is, and that there's no chance that we are alone. But we will never know in our lifetime, if ever."
18802,I remember feeling crushed under the reality of how small we are when I first saw the Hubble ultra deep field pics.
18803,"If you ever get a chance and find yourself in Seattle, I HIIIIIGHLY recommend going to the Imax at the Pacific Science Centre and watch the Hubble 3d show. They render the images taken by the Hubble to generate a real-D image that gives you absolutely *stunning* visuals of the galaxy, gas clouds, birth of stars, and more. It's one of the coolest things I've seen. Very touching to see space like that. I find comfort in our tiny existence. Realising it only makes it that much more incredible that we're alive in a time where we not only have the technology and intelligence to look into space and ask questions, but a time in which we can still look up in space and see stars. Billions of years from now, our brothers and sisters throughout the universe will only see a dark sky, forever incapable of exploring space like we will.


We are so fucking lucky."
18804,[The pale blue dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) is the picture that humbled me to the universe. Basically it's a pic of Earth taken from the edge of the solar system.
18805,"Shit thats really cool! I could've sworn we were part of the Virgo supercluster, but Laniakea sounds way cooler.

18810,"[I tried making an art house film when I was like 11 or 12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXVkH7xPgQY&list=UUjXwErWsirWQde0SA3IReHQ).  Still makes me cringe sometimes when I see it, but it's kind of heartwarming and funny in its own way."
18811,That juggling from below scene was somehow fascinating.
18812,It was reversed I guess
18813,When I was 12 I was to busy jerking off to do anything remotely productive. Kudos to you.
18814,"This is really nice, some of the shots are genuinely interesting, bit overall the film has this lovely cosy feel to it. Like the snow outside would probably have been a more interesting subject but the idea of you thinking up all these faux-arty shots is really nice."
18815,"Yeah, I remember my thought process at the time just being ""oh, that looks kind of nice, I'll film that for a bit"".  Which inadvertently gave me a weird nostalgia trip 10 years later for realizing how I used to look at things like snow and trees so deeply."
18816,"Why would you even cringe over that? It's AWESOME!! It's like I had a chance to peer into your world for a short time. Also, the fact that you chose Claire De Lune. I mean, WOW! 

It brought back memories of myself being young and my boyfriend and I staying late after school in the choir room and him playing that for me. Young Love. Sigh.

Thanks for the memory and I thought it WAS GREAT!

EDIT: A word"
18817,"Did you win your middle school film festival? I think there are a lot of really good ideas in this film. I think 11 year old you might not have had a grasp on theme and tone because it seems to dip and swirl and lose sight of two themes I really enjoy in it: the play on perspective, seeing common things from a different perspective greatly changes my thoughts on it, but nostalgia too. I'm sure you didn't intend nostalgia to be a big part of it seeing as you were a young boy, but watching this gave me an insight into childhood I haven't felt since I was that age. Kudos man, my films when I was 11-12 were about me kicking alien ninjas in the face and there were no alien ninjas ever on the screen..."
18818,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply!  

I did in fact get ""best in show"" of the middle school film festival, but most of the other films didn't have edits or music, so I don't think anyone really entered it with too much of a competitive spirit.  One particular Andy Warhol-esque entry was a kid who filmed himself chasing his dog around the house for 10 minutes.  

I remember my thought process being at the time that I wanted to film mundane stuff in weird ways (hence eating the bagels and everything), but a lot of the film just ended up me looking out a window thinking ""oh, that's kind of pretty"" or something like that.  Definitely didn't have a coherent end goal in mind in terms of tones or themes, as much as I just kind of went ""oh, that's neat and works well with the music""."
18819,"Le film qui m’a le plus énervé : Perspective – Scénario cousu de fil blanc, absence d’étincelles entre les deux partenaires (c’est ballot quand le film repose sur le présupposé d’une passion racinienne – et svp ! bloobedyblahblah12, reviens pour diriger ala Tahar Rahim, car tu es le seul à être capable d’en sortir quelque chose de crédible !) ; enfin gros sabots auteuristes et citationnels, avec signature juste à la  fin de la réalisatrice en lettres géantes rouges (pour ceux à qui cela aurait échappé que avait commis ce faux GRAND film)."

18825,You too bud.
18827,"There are a lot of things at play here that are really quite well executed for someone as young as you were. I watched that all the way through and even felt like I connected with it on an intellectual level, which is more than I can say about anything I've ever seen by an 11-or-12-year-old, ever. If you have an unrelated day job nowadays, I'd say pick up the hobby again. You got some serious talent lurking there, bud."
18828,"I have no job at all coming out of college here, so it might be a while until I have free time for a hobby again.  :P  But who knows?  

thanks for the kind words, though!  :)"

18839,"Ahhh, YouTube comments. You know you shouldn't read them, you know they're going to be fucking awful, and you know you should just skip them entirely... but then you still look anyways. Afterwards, you just facepalm yourself, wondering just how the hell these people function in real life. 

Seriously, why does YouTube have the absolute worst comments?"
18840,"I can't answer why, but even if there were a video where someone discovers a cure for both AIDs and cancer at the same time, the comments would still be the worst thing in the world."
18841,"I bet it would go something like:

""First comment!""
""teh ALS bucket challenge actually did something!""
""this is a good thing like if u agree!!!""
""took long enough""
""visit my channel because im an up and coming 15yr old singer named Henry ez Karmica""
""i thought only gay people and black people got aids""
""this sucks cause aids and cancer was natures population control to kill of the week""
""Science and inteligence is what cured this shit, not ur fake fucking god u stupid cristans.""
