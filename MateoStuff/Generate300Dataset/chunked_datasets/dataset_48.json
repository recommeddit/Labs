15456,"Don't even think about any kind of maple except the native ones, and native to central or west TX not east. You can get TX native gardening books out of the library and there is also a COA green gardening guide.

How old is the big is the oak and when was it planted? If it was recently, it may just need to get over transplant shock and get established well. Most oaks around here are really good trees but you have to watch out for oak wilt. Red oaks get good fall color.

Be sure to pay attention to the soil requirements of any other trees you plant. Some can take the limestone and some can take the clay but usually not both."

Liquidambar styraciflua - star-shaped leaves, turns bright red, purple, or yellow in fall.

15463,Quite welcome.
15464,"I've personally found Ace rub to perform rather poorly in suburban soil. Same case with  Liq sty - it loathes alkaline soil from what I've read / been told. Really beautiful tree, though. 

Ame can can grow up to 15-20m (but will take rather long) so it's really more a tree I think? 

I also want to add Cornus alternifolia, because it's a part of a trio of flowering trees that I really like, the other two being Cer can and Ame can."
15465,"If by ""suburban"" you mean compact clay, then yes, it will do poorly, along with 95% of other plants. As long as you loosen 2-3x the width and plant a couple inches high, I've had no trouble, even in native clay soil. Liquidambar has a taproot and doesn't do well in shallow planting areas e.g. sidewalk plots. Alkaline is easy to remedy when planting.

There are different cultivars of Amelanchier that don't get as big. 'Rainbow Pillar' is a nice one.

Is alternifolia resistance to dogwood anthracnose? I generally don't recommend them much anymore."
15466,"How do you remedy alkaline? Elemental sulfur and composted mulch? That can help, but for trees they generally wouldn't do well, since you'll have to reapply elemental sulfur (if not mulch as well) every other year or so, and you'll have to increase the area of application to account for the growth of the root zone. 

By suburban, I mean alkaline and droughty soil. Ace rub is a floodplain species with a definite preference for spring flooding, and stresses without it. 

And yes, C. alternifolia is resistant afaik. Good air circulation also helps."
15467,"I typically mix sulphur powder or aluminum sulphate into the hole, mix more in as I backfill, and add more around the planting area. It's usually enough after rain soaks it in, but it's simple enough to add more every year or two. And yeah, if people don't ever water that is a problem, but after a couple years I've never had one die, even in heavy, exposed, drought-tolerant clay."
15468,"Oh when I say performance I mean like long term, like Ace rub is supposed to live 120 years or so, so if it dies in the first 50 years means failure to me."
15469,For a city tree 50 years is pretty damn good. The average is about 12.
15470,"Then why would you use Ace rub for a city tree when it's not gonna reach maturity? There are plenty other good options. Carpinus caroliana's fall colour is comparable, and a 50yo Ace rub is gonna be around the same height and spread as Car car at the same age."
15471,"I use them in front yards, not along roadsides. I've also found Carpinus to break a lot easier. That, and client preference."
15472,"u/ZumboPrime has given you quite a good list, and here are some plants that will be complementary to their reccomendation.

&#x200B;

Instead of magnolia (which honestly is a bit overused), try these trees at the back: Amelanchier canadensis, Cercis canadensis, Cornus alternifolia (which has a variegated variety called ""argentea"" - really pretty, but will need some darker back drop to really pop). I would use all three and space them 10' apart, in clusters. 

For shade / accent tree: Nyssa sylvatica, or (non native, but so, so, so pretty) Acer palmatum 'sango kaku'.

I would also use a few evergreens at the back to create privacy: Abies lasiocarpa, Abies balsamea, Pinus cembra. 

&#x200B;

Shrubs: Cornus sericea is very nice, but if you want something similar but larger, Cornus racemosa. Viburnum lentago is basically the same size and somewhat similar in fall colour, but the flowers are more conspicuous. Aronia arbutifolia 'brilliantissima' is *beautiful* in spring and fall, and the flowers are fragrant. 

You might want to try Salix integra 'hakuro nishiki'. If left alone (unpruned), it will overtime form an graceful, arching shrubs. 

&#x200B;

What you really should do is to have your soil tested at a lab - I recommend SGS. Most plants would like a pH of 6.5-7.2, and an organic matter content of 5-10%."
15473,Good additions!
15474,Size?

15476,"I love the ginkgo tree. The foliage is gorgeous, brilliant yellow in the fall. It is a forever home tree, as it grows slowly, and gets really tall."
15477,"I love red oaks but I dont think that quite fits the criteria you are going for, everyone else seems to have good ideas though, im from the south and don't know Northern plants well. I loved working in my local plant nursery and learning lots though."
15478,"Haha yesss. I’m finding so many plants I like and then I see the zone and it’s like darn, if only I were a few hours south."
15479,Check out the Cincinnati Zoos website.  It’s a great botanical garden with lots of insight on plants that thrive in your area.  There you can find brochures on the zoos best large medium and small trees shrubs perennials annuals and grasses.
15480,Omg awesome!! They had so many beautiful evergreens when I went. I will definitely check that out and take another visit. :)
15481,"Where are you located? Are you interested in native alternatives? Note that given time and space, even smallish trees like Japanese maples can grow to 20 feet wide and tall."
15482,"I'm in northern Virginia outside DC.  Native alternatives, sure."
15483,"I am in the west so I’m not too familiar with the trees out there, but a good native alternative to Japanese maple would be eastern redbud (*Cercis canadensis*) - they’re a small, multi-trunked tree like the maple, but in the spring they burst to life with tons of pink flowers that attract both native pollinators and honeybees. They have vibrant fall color, and there are a number of different cultivars, including some with red or golden summer foliage."
15484,I don't think I would describe them as small in context to this yard. Their are nice weeping redbuds that are available but a native redbud grows fairly large.
15485,"Another good one would be eastern burning bush (also called eastern wahoo), which can easily be grown as a tree as well. 

http://grownative.org/plant-picker/plant/wahoo/"
15486,"If you are willing to consider a different tree species a serviceberry may work for you.  They are multi-stemmed, have spring flowers and beautiful fall foliage.  One of their greatest assets is that their canopy is not dense, so a lot of light can pass through even in the summer when all the leaves are out.  There are a tone of cultivars in existence, however for a really tiny yard the new pillar shaped cultivars like rainbow pillar serviceberry may be the way to go. ( [http://plants.gertens.com/12070009/Plant/3116/Rainbow\_Pillar\_Serviceberry/](http://plants.gertens.com/12070009/Plant/3116/Rainbow_Pillar_Serviceberry/))"

15494,Looking at the picture i think service berry is a great option. I suggest one of the more narrow tree form like cumulus or Robinhill. I think Japanese maple would look alright with small shrubs around it. Another option would be a flowering dogwood such as venus.
15495,"When clients ask me for a small tree I often have success showing them a Hydrangea Standard. It's pretty nice when it flowers, can be kept small by yearly hard pruning or left alone to get a bit bigger."

15503,Hahaha.  Good idea...though possibly expensive.
15504,What about a dwarf fruit tree!!?  I am currently digging those for my backyard
15505,A columnar peach tree might do. They get about 20ft tall but stay pretty..columnar. they don't spread much. They also have nice flowers in the spring.
15506,"There are several nice evergreen trees that are hardy in your zone. You could plant evergreen Magnolia, Christmas Holly, Eucalyptus neglecta/gunnii or train Cherry laurel as a tree.

My personal favorite though would be Loquat. It has large, broad, evergreen leaves and if the trees are old enough or grafted, a pleasantly smelling bloom. It also has the Award of Garden Merit by the RHS and if you are lucky and the winters are mild enough, you might even get fruit off of it. For that reason I would get a self-fertile, late-ripening fruit variety to increase your chances (such as Tanaka).

I can also vouch for the very nice smell of Cherry laurel flowers."
15507,"Does loquat manage ok with little maintenance, it sounds very exotic?"
15508,"It's in the Rosacea family and related to Quince, Apple and Pear. In fact, you can graft it onto all of those, if that makes it sound less exotic :D

It should do just fine with little maintenance, but it will grow more shrub-like if you don't prune it. If you prune it, it's similar to its relatives, in that you take out branches to ensure that light can penetrate into the center of the canopy."
15509,Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions - I love the look of the Amelanchier Lamatckii. I might leave the naked gardening for later in the year though 😉
15510,"Btw, the berries of Amelanchier lamarckii are also edible."
15511,I will Google this for reassurance but thank you anyway 😉
15512,"So guys, I recently moved in. The tree in the corner is a sycamore and the roots are doing damage to the walls. The sap it drops is gross also. 

I live in the UK in London and ideally I'd like a an evergreen tree to screen the garden off from the neighbours. It's south facing and ideally I would like it to have a smallish non destructive root due to the proximity of the walls. 

Your help will be appreciated 😊"
15513,"Chop that down. 

I’d build a frame and then plant Espalier Apple, pear and plum trees. You won’t get winter cover but you can make lovely pies for all your neighbours. 

Also I find naked gardening soon inspires neighbours to plant evergreens or screens."
15514,"Unfortunately, being London they'll think I'm poisoning them - or worse, being nice which will need them to reciprocate lol"
15515,"Hi, congratulations on your new home! 
A few suggestions, not necessarily evergreen. 
Have you considered pleaching across the back wall? Would require regular pruning/ training to keep growth in check, but would keep an open feel to the garden and give screening from neighbours. The RHS gardens at Wisley have some lovely examples of pleaching.
I love eucalyptus trees in a small garden, but check very carefully for growth rate of your chosen variety! Again, pruning can keep under control. 
A beautiful tree for small gardens is an amelanchier lamarkii, small, stunning at every season, but it is deciduous.

Not a builder so can’t give advice on the wall and roots proximity. 
Whatever you choose, enjoy!"
15516,"Thank you, I'm less than novice at gardening and pleaching scares me somewhat - I'll look it up but if my black fingers (things wither and die) have anything to do with it I might mess up. I love the idea though and think that it will be a slow process, ideally I'd love to rip the sycamore out and plop one right in - but maintenance is where I fall short. I'll watch some videos and see how I feel! Thanks again for your suggestions."

I'd probably use the word ""hypothetical""."
15521,"No, it was funny AND educational. Thanks a lot."
15522,"If climate doesn't matter than plant coffee trees with exotic fruit trees and other edibles. Lychee, longan, rombutan, jabuticaba, cherimoya, avocados, dragonfruit, ice cream bean for fixing nitrogen and for the bean, moringa, macadamia nut, cacao, cinnamon, kava, ginger, and tumeric. The coffee will produce a good crop in 5 years to begin selling. Then the other trees and edibles will mature and if done correctly, something will always be available to harvest all year round for profits. A lot of the fruits, medicinals and edibles I listed go for top dollar even here in Hawaii. You can link up with a CSA, a farm to table chef, a health food store, a high end restaurant, local farmers market or even a gourmet food store and begin supplying them with fresh organic local exotics. Or get a certified kitchen and craft tasty treats to package and sell yourself. Organic macadamia nuts dipped in pure cacao sell for a crazy price. Heck even dragonfruits sell for quite a lot by the pound or single fruit. And kava once matured (10 years for the right cultivar) sells for a very high dollar amount for the raw root. And turmeric can be left unattended to grow large patches of rhizome that can easily be ground into powder and sold for good money too. A high quality avocado typically sells for $1 a piece. And with a mature tree you can be looking at thousands of dollars a year off of one tree."
15523,Best dream-orchard post yet.
15524,Thanks :) this is actualy what we have growing on our land. Except the cherimoya. We are buying trees this year to plant.
15525,Can I live with you?
15526,"Dragon Fruit and Cherimoya fetch nice prices. Moonpurr, you growing any Cupassu or Theobroma bicolor? I am planning on growing the two out in FL sometime soon. Was going to start from seed and plant in the warm microclimate areas of the yard.

Any of the Curcurma sp. seem like good choices for the medicinal qualities. I am growing Curcuma caesia, Curcuma aromatica, and Orange Tumeric. I wanted to grow Kava, but was unsure where to start and which strain would be any good. I was thinking of getting it from Logees, but don't know much about the potency and how decent the strain is."
15527,I am not growing either of cupassu or the bicolor theobroma. I should look into it though as it is a fast producer. I prefer the Mahakea black kava. It is one of the most potent. The plant can take years to strengthen in medicinal qualities. Typically 4 but it gets better with time. We have a huge pant that is going on 30 years in age and quite potent. Once established and thriving cuttings can be made in the spring and you can sell the propagated plants.
15528,As someone with a mini version of your description sitting under a metal halide fixture in an apartment in a hostile climate....NNNNGGGGGH.
15529,"Much appreciated, will keep in mind."
15530,"You want to plant a tree that provides a return (profit) in 5 years? Uhm.. weed. Plant weed.  

Real trees take many years to grow to the size necessary to be sold at a profit. Pine is usually grown commercially because it grows so fast, does well in close stands (more trees per acre), and is easy to harvest. It takes about 35 years from plant to maximum harvest, but you will get smaller 'thinning' harvests before that."
15531,"Thanks for the weed tip but I can't go with that :)

Yes, I meant real trees and I didn't mean like hitting the jackpot after 5 years but at least get something.

I assume you mean pine nuts. Great idea!"
15532,"Are you looking to grow a food crop? Or just a money crop?  I was talking about regular pine trees grown for the wood, not pine nut trees. That is a whole other ballgame."
15533,"Oh, now I see what you meant by ""thinning"" harvest. 

What about pines as a food source?"
15534,"Sorry I can't help you there. Never looked into pine nut trees. The big problem with anything of that scale is going to be how do you harvest, process and sell it in a profitable manner. 30 acres of pine nuts is going to be a massive job and if you pull that off you still have to know where to sell that many pine nuts at the optimal price.   Same goes for anything else you grow. Apples, Peach, etc. 


With pine wood its all contracted out to your lumber buyer. They usually bring in their own equipment.. tractors, cutters, trucks. They harvest and process and send you a check."
15535,Thank you very much for such an extensive information. Much appreciated.
15537,Thanks for the info.
15538,"I would say pistachios because those things seem to be worth their weight in gold.  

I know some people mentioned weed but with the legalization of weed, my guess is everyone and their mom is going to be growing it and the price is going to plummet.  Large companies are going to undercut small growers who don't have the equipment, land size or infrastructure to turn a lower profit margin.  Monsanto is probably working on some kind of absurdly high THC frankin-weed as we speak which will be available at Safeway for less than what an independent farmer can charge.

Some people are mentioning fruits or exotics like lychee but the reason we don't see things like that is because of difficulty with shipping.  Shipability is often the limiting factor with a certain crop.  Do you want to be paying for refrigerated trucks or air shipment for your crop (as well as a certain % of losses)?  Even if you personally aren't the one shipping it, *someone* will and you will be paying for it.  Pistachios are dry, shelf-stable and respond well to shipping.  Maybe a couple pistachios fall out of their shells and slip to the bottom of the bag, that's about it.

Regarding fruits, what some small growers do is stay ahead of the large companies by converting their crops quickly.  Say you were growing plums when they came out with the pluot.  You chop off the branches of the plums and graft pluots.  That way you have a head start over the large growing coops who are trying to grow pluot trees from very small (because the conversion of so many trees isn't economically feasible for them).  And if pluots pass out of fashion and it looks like the next hot thing is plum-icot-arines or whatever, you can convert to those fairly quickly to stay one step ahead of the larger growers.  You could even hedge your bets by having multiple apricot/plum/peach cultivars going at once.  Then your company becomes well-known for new, interesting cultivars and attracts a niche customer base.  So I guess what I would say is rather than decide which fruit, pick a rootstock and scion which is compatible with the highest number of fruits and cultivars."
15539,"I love pistachios. Some fantastic info you got here, thanks so much."
15540,The first thing Monsanto will make is not strong weed but roundup resistant weed.

15546,"Okay, targeting a region will really be key, or rather, picking a crop you want to grow will tell you where to get land...

I am in the mesilla valley around the rio grande. Pecans are a HUGE crop in the valley. You have to wait 15 years for the trees to get to size and shape enough for the production to start. But still that 15 year point they are just cash falling off of trees basically. A low maintenance and lower chemical need crop compared to a lot of nuts."

Money saved on your food costs for years adds up to a lot and you could definitely sell/give away extra from 20-30 acres. You could just start with 5 and keep growing.
15554,I will definitely check permaculture out. Gracias.
15555,"Look up Mark Shepard as a start, then start following the links until you get tired of reading.  

There are groups of trees that will give you some produce in a few years and a ton of things in 10 or so."
15557,"Plant a ginseng crop that is what a friend of mine did. Should be good to go in about 5 years. He also planted a bunch of different fruit trees in that area too. Hopefully in about 5 years the ginseng would be ready, but as for the trees it is more like 10 years.  That and if you got deer you have to protect your little trees from those bastards. They eat everything down to the nub."
15558,Thank you very much for the tips! Appreciated!
15559,"Another tip for planting any fruit tree to deter deer, make cages around the trees. That is what I helped my friend with. The cages though have to be tough enough to stand up to some bastard deer that wants food. Also we put a ring around the trees with fishing line. From experience growing other stuff outdoors, fishing line seems to freak deers out."
15560,I will look to find deer solutions if I don't have any fences. Thanks!
15561,No problem and good luck with your plans.
15562,"Look into Paulownia Tometosa to see if it will grow well in your area. It's an extremely fast growing tree and is the traditional tree used to make Japanese Tonsu's (chests). Also getas, wooden sandals. It's almost impossible to buy but amateur woodworkers need it if they want to make a traditional tonsu.

The wood is very light in weight, somewhere between balsa wood and cedar. The light weight also makes them one of the top woods for building world-class surfboards. The wood is also being used to make very nice electric guitars because the light weight makes them easy to play for long periods when standing.

In Japan there used to be a tradition that when your daughter was born you planted a Paulownia tree (called Kiri in Japan). When she got married you would cut the tree down to make a tonsu.

The boxes that little Japanese trinkets come in are usually made from Kiri wood. In olden days valuable items on Japanese ships would be kept in Kiri wood boxes because the wood doesn't shrink or swell with changes in moisture (once dried) and would protect the valuables from water damage.

All in all a very useful wood that is almost impossible to buy here in the US. Be aware that in some states its considered a weed/nuisance tree."
15563,"Thank you very much, it was really helpful."
15564,"> In Japan there used to be a tradition that when your daughter was born you planted a Paulownia tree (called Kiri in Japan). When she got married you would cut the tree down to make a tonsu.

Had I known this 30 years ago I'd have been able to make quite a few chests by now."
15565,"Noni. It propagates easy and grows really fast. The trees are really productive, even in poor soils. Noni juice is expensive and relatively easy to process."
15566,Never heard of noni before. Thanks.
15567,"Hazel trees start producing quicker than most however the answer depends on where you live, what the dirt is like etc etc.  Walnuts are notoriously hard to deal with because of allelopathy which impacts what else you can grow on the land going forward."
15568,"Hmm, interesting. Currently there is no such land, that's why I didn't mention it.

What about fruit trees? I don't know, let say apples, oranges?"
15569,"No clue, do you have a general area in mind?  You might check out permaculture."
15570,"Not really. I might invest in the future that will also benefit the planet. So just looking for options.

Permaculture... Got it. Thanks!"
15571,"Sounds like you'd really like permaculture, if you can go anywhere try someplace with a nice growing season and low cost of living/property taxes."
15572,"Depending on climate, peaches do fairly well and can be rather prolific. Disease resistant apple varieties can be good producers. Pears are ok. Citrus fruits won't reliably produce north of something like zone 8 or 9. 

Figs are another choice. Though they must ripen on the tree. They don't continue to ripen after being picked. Dates if you are in a desert type climate."
15573,Thanks very much.
15574,Bocote
15575,"Never heard of it before. Looked it up, it is used as a wood source. Thanks, I might investigate further."
15576,"If climate doesn't matter, maybe [Copaifera langsdorffii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copaifera_langsdorffii), aka the diesel tree?"
15577,"Fantastic find, thamks!"
15578,Hemp
15579,Can't and don't want to :). Thanks!
15580,....why not?
15581,Illegal in my country + prefer trees more to help the planet.
15582,"Just a side note, hemp can actually sequester about 3 times more carbon per acre per year than timber.

Edit: Although its far more water intensive."
15583,Maybe because it's illegal where he/she lives...Not every state is as progressive as Colorado.
15584,"If it's in the US. I would go with something native, like persimmons or pawpaws and also include hazelnuts. These are things you don't often see in the store, they're easy to maintain and could fetch a premium on the boutique side of things."
15585,"Not in the US, but still good info. Thanks!"
15586,"In zone 10a, intercrop of Avocado & Coffee Trees.
  ???
  Profit"
15608,Thanks mate.
15588,I'd plant bamboo. Timber varieties take about 5 to 10 years to mature.
15589,Bamboo grows fast. Is it of high value as a wood source?
15590,"think paper products.   it's technically a grass and it's commercial building uses vary by country.  There are many different types, so investigate"
15592,also the shoots of certain varieties go for top dollar at high end Japanese restaurants.   Fresh bamboo shoots from the large varieties are super tasty as well
15593,"Got that, thank you."
15594,"Hops. Or, in the long term, black walnut. (EDIT: Long term like 30+ years. Wood for veneers is what I'm talking about.)"
15595,"Black walnut. Got it, thanks."
15596,"There are issues with black walnut, though. Like once it's harvested, not much will grow there because of chemicals in its roots. And they need to be pruned yearly so that there are no knots in the veneer."
15597,Thanks buddy. I heard walnut tree is a high quality wood source.
15598,"There are a bunch of things immune to juglone, but they are pretty much all you can plant.  Toby Hemenway seems to believe that you can firewall off the walnut by planting resistant species between the walnut and at-risk plants. I know he mentioned mulberry for this."
15600,Why hazelnut and why their hybrids?
15602,Thanks a lot.
15603,If they are grown in Oregon they are called filberts.
15604,"If you want wood I'd go with hybrid poplars. Check out the Boardman tree farm. It is beautiful. The trees grow straight, get to full size in a matter of years, people are always looking for good wood. 

Apples are always good if you want fruit. That is a lot more work though."
15605,"Boardman tree farm is indeed very beautiful. Good choice, thanks!"
15606,The world is a large place and all trees don't grow in every location. If you pick a climate and zone you could better hone your options.
15607,saffron then again that would be a pain in the ass to manage and take care of. Then i would go with hop shoots
15609,There's a guy in seattle that plants saffron in raised beds.  It's hell on the back.
15610,i didn't think seattle would be the right conditions for saffron
15611,"Neither did I but it seems to do fine.  Saffron needs a similar rain cycle to the west coast.  Crocuses do great in the PNW.  Not a lot of late frosts here.  Actually some of the leaves survived the snowpocalypse in November and they look like adolescent chives right now.  

I can't comment on whether the flavor develops fully or not.  I have some in partial sun, I will move some to a sunnier spot when they go dormant again and that'll give me a better comparison."
15612,"I guess that depends on where you're at, how much acreage, and how much work you'd like to do for it. 

Here in Ga, I generally see peaches, pecans, and pines. Farther north there's apples, pears and Christmas trees.for super long term investment, start a huge botanical gardens and create a legacy from it, or you could plant black walnuts for the timber value, or under-marketed fruits like paw-paw, pomegranate, or quince.
Really what I'm trying to say here is it depends on a lot of variables."

15657,"[Gamma Ray](https://www.amazon.com/CHEATERS-Polarized-Wayfarer-Sunglasses-Options/dp/B073XS8YZV?th=1)

~$10 (~$18 for a 3-pack) for surprisingly good build quality and decent looks in a big selection of colors. I have a small face so the fact that they have a 52mm option is great. Shout-out to the Wirecutter for recommending them:

15658,"Well shit, those are party novelty sunglasses prices."
15660,Both the new wayfarer and these come in a 55mm and a 52mm; I've tried the 52mm new wayfarer in store and the size seems pretty comparable to the 52mm gamma rays.

$55, or occasionally a little less on Massdrop. I have the keyhole sunglasses; they're very sturdy and they look good. I've never owned an ""expensive"" pair of sunglasses, but I can't imagine that the build quality could be much better."
15662,Which size did you get?
15663,"I went with the 50 mm, but it really depends on what size your face is."
15666,Could you post some pics? I have a pretty small head and am worried even the small keyhole will be too big
15667,"**Ray\-Ban**

REAL ones from Amazon, Costco, Sunglass Hut \(on sale\), or Nordstrom Rack \(limited selection\) regularly drop below $100. Classic Wayfarer styles are less common as it's \*the\* prototypical pair of sunnies."
15668,I'd add Saks Fifth Ave as another place. Picked up traditional rayban clubmasters for $85 after tax. They also had wayfarers too.
15669,Also Jomashop. I think most of them are ~80ish
15670,Is jomashop legit?
15671,"they are very legit. They are what's called ""gray market"" for watches, and I assume this applies to other products.  
  
Gray market is where you buy wholesale from brands/retailers and sell them for cheaper. If you buy gray market, you get a 100% real product, but without the manufacturer warranty. You get Jomashop's warranty. So if I buy a Rolex from Jomashop, I'll get a real rolex, but without the rolex 2-year warranty. If anything goes wrong and I want it to be covered by warranty, I have to send it to Jomashop. If I take it to Rolex they'll charge me out the ass as I don't have their warranty."
15672,"I'm not totally sure but their Ray-Ban deals were featured on Dappered for best deals in menswear, for what it's worth lol"
15673,Not sure about sunglasses but I just bought an orient ray II watch from them and it was legit. Good prices too
15674,"I got an overpriced pair of Ray Ban opticals from a Pearle Vision like... fiveish years back, and they've been serving me well every day since then. Luxottica usually isn't a great value, but some of their brands are solid if you can get the right deal."
15675,"I have several pairs of Ray\-Bans in this and absolutely recommend the sub $100 Ray\-Bans, which usually means it will have their classic G15 lens. I also have some Original Wayfarers with polarized lenses that seems poorly done \(but have more expensive Ray\-Bans where the polarized lenses are great\), so if you're going below $100, go non\-polarized or at least test the polarized ones before you buy."
15677,"Use Amazon wardrobe or in person at a ray ban dealer (most eyeglass places, Sunglasses hit, etc)."
15679,"Oh! Sorry. 

You can tell by looking through them. Cheaper ones don’t have a uniform look. I think it has more to do with the lens and how the polarization was applied (but don’t quote me on that)."
15680,"Honestly, [eyebuydirect](https://www.eyebuydirect.com/) is great. I've bought a pair of prescription sunglasses from them, and they're great. The prescription is perfect, the frame doesn't feel flimsy, and you can even choose the darkness level of the lenses. It was less than $100 with prescription, so I imagine that without needing a prescription the cost comes out to less than $40."
