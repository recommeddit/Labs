50880,"Illmatic
Liquid Swords
Black on Both Sides"
50881,EPMD Strictly Busniess
50883,Idlsidgo is my all time favorite. Something about it just clicks with me.
50884,"Lil Yachty - Lil Boat


[it's the best](http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/a_ov_pepe_160928.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpg)"
50886,The Slim Shady LP is one of the best for me. Also Late Registration and Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)
50887,"Probably death certificate by ice cube, muddy waters by Redman, or mmlp."
50888,"My favorites in no specific order,

Nas - Illmatic
Joey Bada$$ - B4DA$$
Tyler, the Creator - Wolf
Saba - Bucket List Project
Logic - Under Pressure

I don't think I would consider these the best rap albums ever, but they are my favorites"
50889,"My Favourite (not in order)

Illmatic - Nas
The Documentary - The Game
The Chronic - Dr. Dre
The Infamous - Mobb Deep
It Was Written - Nas
Doggystyle - Snoop Dogg"
50890,"Kanye West ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"". Such an amazing album."
50891,"Gotta be Illmatic. It's flawless from front to back, like even the intro track is probably the best intro track on any album ever, NY State of mind is one of the best rap songs ever, as are Represent, One Love, The World Is Yours, etc. 

Every time I listen to the album I have a different favorite song on it. That's a sign of a great album."
50892,"Madvillain - Madvillainy
Quasimoto - The Unseen
mHz - Table Scraps


I don't know. That's kind of a big question."
50893,"Personal favorite is a tie between Outkast - Atliens and Mos Def - Black on Both Sides. 


But if a kid who thought Earl/Joey/Kendrick/Cole were the best rappers alive asked me for the best rap album EVER, I'd tell them Blu&Exile - Below The Heavens or OneBeLo - S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M."
50894,"1. All Eyez On Me
2. Doggystyle
3. Ready To Die
4. Get Rich or Die Trying
5. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"
50895,"Redman - Muddy Waters

Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill

Common - Like Water for Chocolate

Madvillain - Madvillainy

Outkast - Aquemini

Mobb Deep - The Infamous 

50 Cent - Get Rich Or Die Trying

Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly"
50896,"The Fugees - The Score 
Wu-Tang - 36 Chambers
Nas - Illmatic
Slum Village - Fantastic Vol 2
DJ Shadow - Entroducing 
Madvillain 

Can't think of one but these are the best 6 in no particular order

All have ground breaking production and a special place for me in Hip Hop"
50897,The disrespect for Nas here is astounding.
50898,"Kanye - Late Registration, MBDTF  
Lil Wayne - Carter 3  
Lupe Fiasco - The Cool  
Kendrick - good Kid mad city  
Black Eyed Peas - Elephunk, Monkey Business"
50899,"Madvillainy, A Piece of Strange, MBDTF, ATLiens, Aquemini."
50900,"Mobb Deep - The Infamous

It cant be mentioned enough"
50901,"I will get downvoted to oblivion for liking mainstream artists, but here goes:

1) Yeezus. sampling is cool

2) Carter 4- fun album

3) NWTS- nostalgia

4) Carter 3- bars

5) Trust the Shooter- bars, storytelling, and delivery"
50902,"Does anyone put TPAB in this category?? (I don't, I'm just curious because of all the positive reviews it has gotten, rightfully so)"
50903,"It's definitely in my top 5, I even enjoy it way more than GKMC (and I looooooove GKMC)."
50904,Oh yeah I think it's much better than gkmc. I actually even prefer section 80 over gkmc haha
50905,"As do I. good kid, m.a.a.d. city is really, really, good but I prefer Section.80 sonically."
50906,"Yes, TPAB is some other shit."
50907,I don't. The features on it made it good. It wasn't Kanyes album imo.
50908,You're thinking of TLOP. This is in regards to Kendrick's album.
50909,Which of Kanye's albums?
50910,Nas - It Was Written
50911,I think the best is honestly to pimp a butterfly it just has so much artistic value but my favorite is the Marshall Mathers lp.
50912,j cole went double plat with no features
50913,Do you know how many views Gangnam Style got?
50914,More than twelve I've heard
50915,"Literally *hundreds* of views

People's preferences don't correlate to quality"
51047,"I always feel these lists would be better if they were in ""no particular order"", as in these are what we consider the 500 best albums. When they rank the top 500 it gets silly, I find it hard believe anyone on earth thinks Amy Winehouse's Back to Black is a more worthy album  than Abbey Road or Suedes's  Dog Man Star is better than Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks."
51048,Without the order NME readers wouldn't know which ones to buy first
51049,They didn't put Kraftwerk gratest album: Autobahn. That record change electronic music for ever.
51050,There's a lot of stuff you have to disregard when you're looking for the most viewers rather than an actually comprehensive list.

51053,Thank you for listing them all so I don't have to click through it.
51054,Apparently Bloc Party is better than Can. Neat.
51055,Yeezus isn't number 1? Bullshit list
51056,Top kek..  Seriously though this list is some jive shit
51057,"The fact that that the top Outkast album is Speakerboxxx/Love Below and that ATLiens and Aquemini didn't make the list pretty much invalidates anything this list has to say about hip hop. Also, why is It Takes a Nation of Million always the top hip hop album on any rock critics' list of top albums?"
51058,Did not expect to see my boys BRMC on this list. That's so legit.
51059,"Homework is on there, but not Analogue Worms Attack, or Cross? 

I hate when these lists confuse influential for good."
51060,"Both of those albums are easily worse than Homework, and derivative to boot. ""Influential"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good"", but having a ton of other artists decide they like your sound and want to copy it is generally a pretty good indicator of quality, at least to some degree."
51061,"Are you seriously telling me cross is worse than homework? 

Homework has so many forgettable songs, with little personality that could have blended in easily with the then current scene."
51062,"Hah, and you're telling me that Cross wasn't completely generic when considered in the context of the massive electro house boom that was taking place at the time? And, uh, which songs are you considering ""forgettable"" exactly? Because I know a lot of tracks off that album made several critics' ""best of the '90's"" lists, and they generally know jack shit about electronic music besides IDM."
51063,"Tell me albums that are similar to Cross, besides Human After All, Oi Oi Oi, and Sebastian's Remixes. I'd like to know for my own benefit. 

And some songs that uh, were balls were Phoenix, High Fidelity, and Rock'n Roll."
51064,"Let's see...Mylo's *Destroy Rock & Roll*, Boyz Noize, Busy P, MSTRKRFT, The Bloody Beetroots, Digitalism, Soulwax, the list goes on...

And those are some of the best tracks on Homework. I bet you thought Da Funk was the best song on there and hated Rollin' & Scratchin, right? And didn't understand the references on Teachers?"
51065,"Busy P, Boys Noize, and MSTRKRFT are the only ones with similar sound, and even then aren't that similar. (Haven't heard Mylo, will check it out) 

I personally thought Around the World was the best, but I prefer to listen to Rollin and Scratchin more regularly. 

And yes, I do understand the references on Teachers, and knowing those artists help you figure out homework wasn't that innovative, just a combination of those artists made more poppy."
51066,It's cool how it takes 16 albums from #1 for it to not be a list of white people rock music.
51067,"Even then...

\>Nation of Millions a full 57 places above Illmatic

It's the same tired white rock critic's list it's always been."
51068,13 days late BUT at least they put Dark Twisted Fantasy at 21. IMO it's the greatest rap album ever.
51069,"Maybe not greatest, but it's definitely up there."
51070,"Cool to see A Grand Don't Come For Free crack the top 100. The Streets doesn't often get the attention it deserves. The last song, Empty Cans is brilliant."
51071,"i tried looking for it, but i couldnt find it. you skipped #3

 is it only in the magazine? can't find ranks 300-1 on their site."
51072,"Apologies, mistake.  Number 3 is Hunky Dory by Bowie."
51073,Thank you :)
51074,Thank you for the text list.  Why the hell do websites expect me to want to click through 500 separate slides?
51075,"Wait, Metallica's Black Album is at #309, and Master of Puppets is at #462?

I know everybody is saying it, but this list is pretty bad.  NME has lowered itself in my opinion, especially after their review of Arctic Monkeys' ""AM.""  There is just so much they are missing even in the top 100 for anyone to take this seriously."
51076,"Just went to check up on your 'AM' claim, and...uhm...I, I can't even...[no](http://i.imgur.com/HT1cZlE.gif)"
51077,"I mean, I like the ""AM"" album.  But for NME to throw out that Alex Turner is a genius, comparing him to John Lennon, and all the other claims gets a little ridiculous after a while.  I find it hard to believe that the author took the time to take Alex Turner's dick out of his mouth and actually sat down and wrote this review."
51078,"> But for NME to throw out that Alex Turner is a genius, **comparing him to John Lennon**, and all the other claims gets a little ridiculous after a while



that's been around for a while. I recall the not-really-that-impressive claim of ""Arctic Monkeys debut is better than the Beatles' debut!"" way back when they first started.

I know this is willful ignorance and all, but I've yet to even bother with Arctic Monkeys because of NME's love affair with them. NME strikes me as a not very reliable barometer for music taste, especially when they're very suspicious of non-UK acts and are quick to turn on acts they previously championed."
51079,"Oh I know, they have been jonesing hard on Arctic Monkeys ever since their debut album.  And it appears that it will not slow down any time soon.

Despite NME's review, I quite like ""AM,"" and it has gotten me more interested in the band, but I do not think they are the second coming for rock music."
51080,"Honestly, don't let NME turn you away. The Arctic Monkeys are one of my favorite bands, and they are definitely worth a listen. Listen to their first two albums, you might like it. I don't really get NME's dick-sucking attitude for them, though."
51081,"I'm not overly fond of 'AM' but can see how one can like (even love) the album. But 10/10? I mean, COME ON! And the whole Turner dickfest is almost sickening."
51082,NME has been pretty bad for the past couple of years. They used to be the magazine I disagreed the least with.
51083,Yawn. These lists are pretty much all the same.
51084,This one is a bit different IMO. Not necessarely positive. Artic monkey 19th best album of all time. Are you completely stoned ?

51089,"Well, I definitely can't complain about the huge Bowie presence.  I can't think of any other artist who put out such a long string of good albums."
51090,Or doesn't mind changing his sound/image over time and succeed at it... you read that Madonna?
51091,NME would put Arctic Monkeys that high on a list.
51092,"The Strokes are #3? *Really?* I'm a fan of them but I don't think they should be anyone's ""best of all-time"" list."
51093,"I thought I'd post this to spark some discussion, but I really don't think it's worthy of much praise. This is a generic-ass list. You've got all the ""help-me-seem-credible"" standards in there (Trout Mask, Pet Sounds, etc.), plus some token albums from a few of the ""other genres"" (jazz, hip hop, etc.), and then they do an intentionally controversial top 10 (to get clicks and sell some magazines), and the rest is a mix of what they actually listen to in their iTunes library: forgettable flash-in-the-pan stuff from the last 5 years that will be forgotten in another 5 years."
51094,What did you expect? It's the NME: a generic-ass magazine.
51095,"i mean, what would a good list like this look like? People complain about the Rolling Stone list too."
51096,"If I was doing a list...

* the list would be in no particular order (or perhaps in groups)
* no albums less than 10 years old
* certain bands, e.g. the Beatles and Dylan would either be excluded entirely or have their whole catalog treated as one entry.
* greatest hits and comps would be allowed.
* Perhaps separate some genres into side lists of their own, so you aren't comparing apples & oranges.

i dunno... just shooting from the hip here."
51097,"i think this list sucks (Stone's list is much better as a musical jump off point rather than an end all be all), but it's an impossible task. There is so much good music out there. Probably better music out in the ether that we have never heard that is better than our favorites. Your suggestion are pretty damn good, but even the best lists just exist as discussion points and/or discovery points imo"
51098,"the people bitching at this list have to realize that this is mostly compiled of NME's taste and not very much general consensus is relied upon here. a more acceptable list to criticize would be rolling stone's best of's, as they assemble a huge panel of different judges and still manage to have the most generic taste in a list possible. personally, i think pitchfork's best of lists are probably the least egregious, as it's very easy to see their list as their own and not just a stale, played out top 50 or 100 with the same five beatles or zeppelin albums.

(i think this list isn't good though, what's with the lack of black music in the top 10?)"
51099,"> 8 - Pixies - Doolittle 

> 24 - The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main St. 

..Cool story NME

Nevermind before In Utero?, Where's Kate Bush ""The Dreaming""?, no Grinderman?, no Talking Heads in the top 40?, no Metronomy?"
51100,i think doolittle is better than exile on main street too
51101,">Nevermind before In Utero?


a band's breakthrough album outranked an intentional ""Fuck you"" album? Yeah, more than likely..."
51102,"You can tell they were going for a much more modern list of greatest albums, when compared to Rolling Stone's list.  RS seems to believe the best music was made in the 60s, never to be topped.  However, NME has a definite british bias (except that Sgt Pepper's is only 87), and biased towards 80s music.  Which is probably due to their respective reader's ages."
51103,"I like all of these albums, especially The Queen is Dead, but the greatest album ever? NME to me seems to jump on the alt-rock train into credibility. ""Is This It"" at number three? It's a good album, but can an album that only came out 12 years ago truly be that high on anyone's list? 

Also, I know that NME is a British publication, but their strange affinity for British rock acts gets on my nerves. They hype that stuff up so much it's not even funny, or a novelty anymore.  

Edit: Also not one single 'Mats album? What a joke."
51104,"Their affinity for British rock acts seems not to stem that far past the Gallaghers and Pete Doherty. If you asked me to guess what the NME top ten would look like, it would look not dissimilar to that.

The real strange thing about NME is their seeming wilful blindness of the UK dance scene, which is really what has been the most exciting pop music movement to come from here since the 90s. Music for the Jilted Generation is somewhere in the 100s but Oasis is in the top 10. No Goldie to be seen."
51105,"That blatant ignorance of the UK underground bothers me also. Nice of them to toss Burial in there once, but beyond that it's incredibly rockist."
51106,"really odd move from a mostly ""rock magazine"""
51107,"Dude, they have Oasis at 10th best album of time."
51108,I sighed and moved on.
51109,The orer is pretty bad. Is this it is not a top 20 albums
51110,"i agree with most of this, but 

>can an album that only came out 12 years ago truly be that high on anyone's list? 

why not? i feel as though 12 years is enough time to judge how good or timeless or what have you an album actually is. granted, i wouldn't have is this it so high, but still"
51111,I think NME likes to suck their dick but Is This It is a pretty damn important record.
51112,"I'm not saying it's not important, but is it really *that* good? I don't really know if I'm qualified to say."
51113,But I do agree!
51114,"I'm not sure if I've even heard 500 albums more than once, let alone heard 500 albums I think are great. Neither do they, I reckon. This list is basically ""500 Albums we, NME as a whole, enjoy."" 

I can't even make a ""What!?! *insert band* at *insert number*?"" statement, because it goes without saying."
51115,"> I'm not sure if I've even heard 500 albums more than once,

Really?  Are you sure about that?  500 albums isn't exactly all that much music."
51116,"I tend to listen a very wide range of music like Salsa, Son, Jazz, Soul, Rock, Folk, Blues, Indie... when I listen bands like The Strokes, they sound pretty plain to me, good melodies... but pretty plain... not musically great, not bad too.. so I can't understand how they are listed #3 in lists like this. Am I the only one and I need to listen them again.. or am I right ?"
51117,"The list is basically the 500 best albums from an alt-rock perspective. There is some hip-hop and pop thrown in for good measure, but the list(like most music magazine lists) is very limited.

When it comes to *Is This It* by the Strokes I like it because it's just a really fun, happy album. I didn't like it for a long time because of how overrated it is, but once I accepted that there is nothing profound or that unique about the album then I enjoyed it a lot more."
51118,I think it is absolutely absurd to clump every genre's greatest albums into a list of **five hundred albums.** At this point it just seems crucial to separate this many albums by genre.
51119,"Can anyone suggest one ""XXX Greatest albums of all time"" apart from this and the Rolling Stones one ? I'd like to see something more oriented towards Blues, Soul, Jazz, Folk, Classic, Foreign Music, Etc."
51120,500 greatest albums according to nme? I didn't know Oasis had even made 500 albums.
51121,And this is why no one takes NME seriously anymore.
51122,"I can't believe anyone takes these lists seriously. I'm sure everyone here can name dozens of highly popular and acclaimed albums that weren't on there, essentially making the list meaningless, yet we still need to have a thread to complain about it. Really? These threads tend to be the most popular in the subreddit as well."
51123,"It's become pretty much cliche at this point to hate on these sort of lists whenever they come out. People will inevitably make comments like-

""X album should have been higher! This list is bullshit!""

Or-

""X album should have been lower! This list is bullshit!""

Or- 

""Where the hell is X? This list is bullshit!""

But generally speaking, I like the list. It has a good mix of genres, a lot of albums that I have never even heard of before, and a good mix of ""classics"" and newer releases. Sure, we can nitpick over it for weeks to come, but in the end it's just a list. If you don't like it, don't act like it's the end of the world.

Just look at NME's description of their list-

""The final, definitive, definitely last of its kind, never to be repeated, comprehensive and absolutely accurate word on the best records ever.""

They're actually making fun of anyone who claims ranking albums is a matter of fact and not opinion."
51124,">good mix of genres
 
lets go through just, idk, the top 50, i count:

37 rock albums

4 hip hop albums

3 soul albums

3 electronic/dance albums

2 pop albums

1 folk album

no country, no non western anything, no experimental, no reggae, no funk, no metal (in all of the 38 rock albums), and, most jarringly for me... NOT ONE fucking JAZZ album? are you kidding me? white music for white people, with only cursory (and hilariously limited) glances towards anything else."
51125,"Apparently there were no worthwhile recordings prior to about 1950 either.  

I kinda think it would be more credible if they just stuck to rock.  They don't know shit about jazz.   Look at their 4 token instrumental jazz albums:

* 79 - Miles Davis - Kind of Blue 
* 188 - John Coltrane - A Love Supreme 
* 303 - Charles Mingus - Mingus Ah Um 
* 323 - Miles Davis - Bitches Brew

Such brave choices.  They include these 4, but no other instrumental jazz out of the other 496 albums.... yikes.

NME should stick to what they know and stop posing."
51126,"If it said ""greatest rock albums of all time"" this would be less annoying. I mention jazz because, in my opinion at least, it lends itself to the format of full length albums very well."
51127,Ouch. That's terrible.
51128,"Yeah, the list as a whole is very biased towards rock music, and it's not a great mix of genres by any means, especially in the top 50 or so albums, but overall they were able to incorporate a fair amount of different genres in the list, although a lot of genres were very underrepresented in the end.

In the bottom 50 for instance, we get albums from hip-hop, post-punk, synthpop, soul, proto-punk, disco, R&B, psychedelic pop, and heavy metal to name a few. Yeah, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's better than a lot of lists out there."
51129,"> Yeah, the list as a whole is very biased towards rock music


I think the criticism that there aren't other genres included in this list is kind of silly. You could certainly criticise NME for being ignorant/indifferent to non-UK Rock acts, but it seems rather pointless as it's fairly obvious what kind of music NME is interested in. It's like chiding Kerrang for not including Pet Sounds."
51130,Or complaining that a country music magazine snubs Slayer or Public Enemy in their lists.
51131,"If a country magazine made a list of absolutely nothing but country, then no one would care. But this is titled simply ""the greatest albums of all time"" and features only a token effort to acknowledge that anything other than rock music exists."
51132,"To be completely honest, if a country music magazine made a list called ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" and included nothing but country I would not care a single bit. They're a country music magazine, of course they're going to think the 500 greatest albums of all time are country."
51133,"But like someone else pointed out, ""white male rockers"" are the only ones that do that. A country magazine (well, I assume, I don't read them) wold specify that they were talking about country, cut the bullshit and just talk about country. I think that's preferable to this."
51134,">It has a good mix of genres

>it's not a great mix of genres by any means

also

>In the bottom 50 for instance

yeah, when i said cursory glances part of what i meant was throwing that shit at the bottom

>hip-hop, post-punk, synthpop, soul, proto-punk, disco, R&B, psychedelic pop, and heavy metal

a third of those are styles of rock music"
51135,"I'm not saying I entirely disagree with you. I wish that the list could have had a wider variety of genres in higher positions myself. But I guess I was just expecting something a lot more homogenous than what actually came out, and for that reason I'm somewhat satisfied."
51136,"It's not merely a White People list but a White Male list. The list is also saturated with British and American musicians. Musical styles or artists in just about any Asian, African, or South American country is completely disregarded. But who's surprised? It's exactly the same as NME's narrow-minded viewpoint on music."
51137,"It's NME, a UK based magazine focusing on rock music. Of course they're going to put lots of UK based rock acts on their lists. If a music magazine from Ghana put out a list of their ""top albums"" would you complain if their list was all African music? Would you complain if an India based music magazine put out a list full of Indian music? Or a hip-hop magazine putting out a list of all hip-hop music?"
51138,"I feel that it's a kind of limited viewpoint in today's age of the Internet. Maybe like twenty years ago when all the music you could buy was at the record store downtown then it would be fine to focus on music from your area. Even today, local music reviewers are pretty darn valuable. And if NME wants to be the rock music reviewers that's fine. But to say these are the greatest albums is being intellectually dishonest. I would also say it's doing a disservice to its readers by continuing this perpetual white male UK/America bias that music critics have about what's the best ever.

So if a hip-hop magazine put out the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" and they were all hip-hop I'd roll my eyes too. But they don't really do that... it's the white rocker people who are so darn sure their music is the only thing that has hit the masterpiece status... and *maybe* Kind of Blue.

But who gives a crap about any of these lists. As someone who doesn't want to be confined to one genre, one nation, one set of ideals, I'd love to have an actual place that does reviews of stuff from around the world and can gather them together in a more reasonable context. I want to hear the greatest albums and not just the rock albums. It's the cornerstone philosophy of how I view listening to music in today's Internet age, and I feel like critics and critical sites ignore this argument. In doing so they lose credibility."
51139,"That's a fair enough argument to make. I guess there are two ways to see the NME list-

1. A UK based rock magazine puts out a list of the ""greatest albums of all time"", but manages to include a decent amount of non-rock music from outside of the UK because it truly believes those albums should be recognized.

2. A UK based rock magazine puts out a list of the ""greatest albums of all time"", ignoring countless genres and countries and women in general.

Furthermore, I don't really think this is a problem inherent to ""white male rocker people"" as you do. ""White male rocker people"" are typically the type of people behind professional music journalism. It's not strange that they like other ""white male rocker people."""
51140,"> ""White male rocker people"" are typically the type of people behind professional music journalism.

oh hey you just noticed why ""professional music journalism"" is stupid and useless"
51141,"Let's try to act mature about this. The entire ""professional music journalism"" profession is not ""stupid"" and ""useless"" simply because it's dominated by white males who are prone to their biases like all human beings are."
51142,"when everyone has the exact same bias, it gets tedious and i fail to see the point"
51143,"I agree that lists like this can seem tedious at times, but from personal experience, ""professional music journalism"" has given me the chance to listen to many, many artists that I may not have been exposed to otherwise. Many of my favorite artists, albums, and songs are ones I had first learned about by reading music lists and reading essays on music by professional music reviewers. Additionally, there are many ""cult classic"" albums that may have been forgotten if not for their standing in the critical world, albums like Television's ""Marquee Moon"" or Captain Beefheart's ""Trout Mask Replica"", to name a few."
51144,"yeah i was going to keep track of that as well in that tally, but i was too lazy to look up if any of the five members of each band on there ive never seen a picture of was a woman"
51145,I like how the only reggae presence is two relatively unimportant Bob Marley albums.
51146,Dexys Midnight Runners are before Johnny Cash. There's no Red Headed Stranger or any other country....lawl...but that's par for the course for these lists.
51148,">lets go through just, idk, the top 50"
51149,"Ugh, do they really expect you to go through all 500 one at a time? They should at least put 10 per page or something."
51150,Seems like they just threw some good albums into a list in the most disorganized order possible.
51151,"I'd encourage everyone to read the descriptions of the albums.  Poor English abounds, but every once in a while you'll get gold like the description for Kendrick's GKMC: ""The East Coast rapper's first big budget album...""

Also: ""Dr. Dre - 2001 (2001)""

ALSO: Tribe's ""bonafide party classic 'Can You Kick It?'"""
51152,Why the hell is Physical Graffiti not on this list.
51153,"Considering there are no Black Sabbath albums on this list, there is really no reason to talk about it."
51154,"I take these lists with a grain of salt, but are you fucking kidding me? Not one fucking Modest Mouse album, yet there are two Arctic Monkeys albums. Forever done with NME."
51155,I think only the first Arctic Monkeys should make this list. The Moon and Antarctica should be on the list however.
51156,"First Hendrix album is #103.  Bullshit.

First Zeppelin album is #106.  Bullshit.

Michael Jackson Thriller at #131.  Bullshit.

First Pink Floyd album at #132.  Bullshit.

First The Who at #275.  Bullshit.

First Pearl Jam at #339.  Bullshit.

No Queen.

No King Crimson.

No Muse.

No Porcupine Tree.

No Black Crowes.

No Rush.

No Stone Temple Pilots.

First (and only) Zappa album at #359.  FUCKING BULLSHIT.

How am I supposed to take this seriously?"
51157,In what world would muse ever be on a top 500
51158,I'm more wondering about Stone Temple Pilots.  I thought the consensus was that they were (are?) fairly mediocre.
51159,Born in le wrong generation
51160,The list is bullshit. No point complaining in this sub though.
51161,"Yeah, this list is worthless. There's a lot on here that really have no right to be here, and there's a lot that aren't on here that really should be.

No Black Sabbath.

No Red Hot Chili Peppers.

No Gorillaz. 

No Aerosmith, REO Speedwagon, ELO(Missing a lot of very monumental classic rock overall)

I'd probably put Broken Bells somewhere in here as well.

Yet they filled the list with crap. Kanye(I mean I liked some of Graduation, but there's much better artists), Amy Winehouse... Honestly, as important as the Sex Pistols were, and however much I like them, it was a pretty terrible album overall. Not #38 material. 

The author very obviously has a lot of bias as well... I think I saw 4 or 5  Smiths albums, including the one he put in 1st. 

...and I just noticed Ill Communication as the first Beastie Boys album listed... really?

Edit: The hell, guys? If you're going to downvote me, at least say something! It's about discussion. I'm in the negatives, and the only comment I've gotten was agreeing. Got a problem? Let's talk."
51162,No Sabbath from a UK magazine is truly embarrassing.
51163,"I'm actually really surprised that they didn't put the Gorillaz there.  Not because they deserve it - I love them, but it's a big world and I'm sure there are 500 better albums - but it seems like the sort of thing NME would faun over."
51164,In what world is REO Speedwagon on a top 500 list?
51165,"They were a very prominent classic rock band. I realize now that I had much better options to pick from, but I had a song of theirs stuck in my head."
51167,I can't really disagree with them on that front... :)
51169,"Let's just say I agree with Nick Cave as far as the Chili Peppers go.  Flea seems like a cool guy, but the singer's voice drives me nuts.   

Nick Cave on them:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm forever near a stereo saying, ‚ÄòWhat the **** is this garbage?‚Äô And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers.‚Äù"
51170,This sub hates the chili's because they're too mainstream.
51171,"i can't speak for the sub as one person but i dislike them because i feel they distill funk into trite, boring renditions that mostly appeal to frat bros."
51172,Have you ever considered that this sub hates the Chili Peppers because disliking them is actually an equally valid opinion to liking the?
51173,"True, but giving a wave of downvotes to anyone who mentions them in a music discussion sub gives a far different impression."
51175,I agree completely. I have SA on vinyl and it's one of my most prized possessions. There so many flaws in list that it's not really worth worrying about.  Eminem's #135 yet Kanye west is #21. Yeah ok.
51176,"Live Through This by Hole is higher than Kid A, Born To Run and In The Aeroplane Over The Sea

(Pause to let that sink in)"
51177,"No Broken Bells. No Sublime. No Phoenix. No Deftones. No Tool. Michael Jackson's Thriller album is 131, yet Nirvana's In Utero is 35? And Random Access Memories makes the list? That album is a pile of shit and the fact that the author of this list is caught up in its popularity to the point of including it here shows that this entire list, and every list that tries to rank art, is a pile of shit."
51178,"My list:

1. MBDTF

2. College Dropout

3. Watch the Throne

4. Late Registration

5. Graduation

6. TLOP

7. 808's

8. Cruel Summer

9. Yeezus"

2. College Dropout

3. Late Registration

4. 808's & Heartbreak

5. Graduation

6. TLOP

7. Watch The Throne

8. Yeezus

9. Cruel Summer

But I love every album front to back. It's always hard to put any of the albums low on the list, but the top ones are easy"
51180,How is it possible to have TLOP above Late Registration and 808s? How can you put Graduation second? Why is Complex consistently terrible?
51181,"This. I know music like most stuff is subjective, but personally I cannot comprehend why someone would rate TLOP over anything else Kanye's put out."
51182,Pablo is better than Cruel Summer and Yeezus in my book.
51183,Cruel Summer was full of bangers with the hottest artists
51184,And no real focus on the actual roster. It's like Kanye decided to be DJ Khaled rather than Rick Ross with the MMG projects.
51185,"Cruel summer was a compilation of good friday releases anyway, only 4 tracks were new and they all had Ye in them"
51186,On this we can agree. It just left me wanting more from the main roster. I surprisingly agree with Complex on that one
51187,"What? TLOP is his best album, I'm surprised to not see this as the top comment."
51188,I personally hate 808s and it's my least favorite Ye album. But TLOP is 4th/5th and LR is 2nd
51189,"For those of you who don't want to click/just want to know the ranking. Spoiler alert, you probably won't like it:

4. Late Registration  
5. Yeezus  
6. TLOP  
7. Watch The Throne  
8. Graduation"
51193,Why do you rate Graduation last?
51194,I have it last too Mainly because the highs don't reach up to his other albums for me and the lows are really low
51196,I only count his solo work and even though Flashing Lights is in my top 5 Kanye songs I still think Graduation isn't as consistently great as something like CD or even TLOP even though that might drop down my list
51197,"Barry Bonds is probably my favorite song on the whole album, 2nd Everything I Am"
51198,Basically what other dude said and the songs dont do much to me. Out of all his work this sounds the most dated.

For what it's worth, I do like every album. I don't think any album is particularly bad in any way, even if it's near the bottom."
51203,"Very subject to change 
Also keep in my mind that I don‚Äôt think any of these albums are tens, only 9.5‚Äôs at best

Watch the throne and cruel summer don't count as Kanye albums for me"
51218,I can understand why you don't count Cruel Summer but how is WTT not a kanye album
51219,"Half the verses are jay zs. It's credited to ""The Throne"""
51220,"Because it's a collaboration project. This is just me personally, I don't count collaborations as the individual artist's album"
51221,808 is best doee
51222,"I'm not even gonna lie, maybe it wasn't his most influential but I think TLOP is his best album"
51223,"I think it's easily the worst excluding Cruel Summer. Terrible lyrics, sub par production by his standards, sounds like a rushed mixtape, so much filler, just generally not very good."
51224,"Maybe it's recency bias. I think all the samples on the album are beautifully mixed, you've got catchy songs like Father Stretch pt.1, soul in Ultralight Beam, and in general it's unique compared to his other albums. I can get how people would dislike it though"
51225,"It just doesn't wow me as much as his other albums do, it feels like he's being messy to be interesting instead of actually making the music itself interesting. Nothing about it really stands out to me"
51226,To one their own opinion. Just thought it didn't sound much like a Kanye album which I liked
51227,It just sounded like pieces of different Kanye albums quickly thrown together
51228,"Well call me a cheap bullshit poetic but the way Kanye has been these past years it feels in place. The cover art solidifies this to me. You have his come up and childhood gospel roots in ULB for example, but Freestyle 4 is straight cocaine sniffing Lamborghini racing Kanye I can picture at his peak just as well."
51229,MBDTF portrays that type of chaotic and contradictory life while still being cohesive. TLOP needed about three more weeks of work and it would have been really good.
51230,"lmao thats an insult to cruel summer

Creepers, Higher, Clique, Don't Like.1, New God Flow, To The World, The Morning, AND Mercy. 

youre crazy"
51231,"Clique, God Flow, Morning maybe, and Mercy. Miss me with the rest. If u count Denim Flow, go ahead"

51238,Trash list if I ever saw one...
51239,Idk why websites keep doing these lists. There is no ranking they could put up there that a sizable population wouldn't have a problem with.
51240,"MBDTF>CD>LR>Grad>Yeezus>TLOP>808s>WTT imo

Yeezus, TLOP, and 808s are all pretty interchangeable for me tho"

51247,Spigen mag armor for my 12 pro max is excellent. Buy it from Amazon not their site
51248,Free 20W charger if you order from their site though
51249,"Yes but Amazon is $20 vs direct from Spigen $45, I‚Äôd rather just buy Apple 20W and still save a couple bucks"
51250,don't these affect the wireless charging though if its specifically not magsafe case? or am i mistaken
51251,It is specifically a mag safe case. You can even see where the magnet is built in
51252,"A question from a newbie who's gonna get his first iPhone: why did you choose Spigen Mag Armor and not the Apple's silicon case, for instance? Apple's case has also a raised lip protecting the camera from what I saw, so what are the advantages of Spigen Mag Armor over Apple's cases in your opinion?"
51253,The texture of the silicon case is really unpleasant - it catches in every single pocket you put it on. It also has terrible durability for its price (see my post history)
51254,"silicone peels off easily on the corners I wouldn't recommend silicone at all, or the transparent cases (these turn yellow over time). Get a solid plastic one that's not transparent imo."
51255,I bought Spigen case first. Not grippy. Bad Magnet. Got Apple Silicon Case. Much better magnet. Much better Grip. AT&T has $10 off all 13 cases currently. BestBuy did price match.
51256,Used the Smartish case on my XS Max for 2 years. Very satisfied with it. Ordered one for my future 13 Pro.
51257,"Spigen is great, been using the Tougharmour for my iPhone XR for over a year, and she‚Äôs a beast, gets through drops and bumps with no problem whatsoever,"
51258,Used multiple Spigen (mostly for different colors.)for my 11 Pro throughout. Well made case.
51259,I have one called spigen liquid air armor and I love it. It‚Äôs not a bulky case but it still provides protection. I also like how it doesn‚Äôt get stuck to clothing when putting it in my pocket. I‚Äôll probably end up getting something from spigen for my 13 pro.
51260,How good would you say is the drop protection? I just bought the Mag Armor but like the look of the liquid air armor. I do tend to drop my phone quite a bit since I‚Äôm clumsy.
51261,"I would say it‚Äôs good! I‚Äôve dropped it several times and haven‚Äôt had any issues. Maybe just some scratches to the screen but my phone has so many now that it doesn‚Äôt bother me. It also isn‚Äôt super grippy, it easily slides out of my hand so that could be something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre more clumsy. I would like to get it again but it‚Äôs not available on Amazon for me so I‚Äôm thinking of going with the rugged armor for now.

Edit: mine is for the 7 plus, looking at the newer ones it looks like they‚Äôve added grip to the sides which mine doesn‚Äôt have so I‚Äôd imagine it would be a bit better than what I currently have."
51262,"Golden Brown I think will pair nicely the Sierra Blue phone. I already got my case in a few days ago.

[Link](https://imgur.com/a/JLmlnYW)"
51263,"Definitely a nice pairing. It‚Äôs between dark cherry and the black for me tbh, I feel like the black pairs so well with the blue."
51264,I ordered the golden brown wallet for the same reason. I think it's the only leather color that matches the Sierra Blue nicely.
51265,They looks darker in that pic than on Apples site. That might get moved to the maybe Column for me.
51266,Same but with a golden phone.
51267,I debated on this one but ultimately went with the new green leather to pair with Sierra Blue.
51268,"Sierra blue with this case to dark the blue a bit

51270,Damn this one looks good
51271,Nomad case
51272,Nomad leather?  Have you used them before?  I think I‚Äôm leaning that way as well
51273,"Yes I had two with the Moment lens mount when I had my pixel 4xl. The leather was durable, and the overall case was designed well."
51274,"Nomad has the best leather cases IMO. only thing i would caution against is their Folio wallet case, as it tends to tear at the hinge easily. Mine tore within a few months, but then held on for a year before it tore completely off. Now i just use the phone case part, and will likely buy just the regular leather wallet from them for my 13 pro"
51275,"I just grabbed one as well after having an AirPods case, super excited"
51276,"I‚Äôm honestly not feeling the colors of the official cases. The leather ones in particular. The blue looks really dark. And the brown too light. 
Conflicted."
51277,"Either nude or the Pitaka case, idk yet"
51278,Pitaka here. I‚Äôve had them for the last 3 phones and I love the size and texture.
51279,I currently have an 11 Pro Max with a Pitaka case and love it! Although I read that they changed their case slightly for the 12 and the edges around the screen are super sharp. I hope that‚Äôs not the case for the iPhone 13 also. I ordered a 13 Pro Max.
51280,any update on the pitaka case?
51281,Spigen
51282,"I personalised a case from Casetify, I do hope the price equals quality."
51283,I have one of their Ultra impact cases on my 12 pro max and love it! Ordered another one for 13 but won‚Äôt be here til sometime in October ‚òπÔ∏è bought a cheap amazon one in the meantime cuz naked phones make me nervous
51284,I‚Äôm trying them this year as well so hopefully they‚Äôre as good as their price demands
51285,"I cancelled my order and bought one from tech 21, I need it next friday."
51286,Ima just buy a 13 pro once my case ships in early October
51288,"I had one customized for my xs but the side started to rip, tho it lasted a year n some change . Not sure if they have a warranty but for how much it cost me I was bummed out it ripped without getting dropped"
51289,Channel sponsor Dbrand
51290,Pitaka Mag EZCase 2.  Adds grip to the phone without making it much larger.  Plus it has magsafe.
51291,I like the grip it adds but it‚Äôs not too much grip. Pitaka makes good cases.
51292,"I had a case from Nudient last year that‚Äôs a hard shell case. It was so well refined the speaker grills had individual holes. There‚Äôs a MagSafe ring built into the case and it‚Äôs saved my phone from a few drops. (Peel ripped them off, they‚Äôve had cases for years, peel just dropped their 12 pro series this year and completely copied their design) 


I‚Äôm checking out the moment cases this year, I ordered the regular one and the leather one. I wanted one for my 12 pro max but they didn‚Äôt have MagSafe compatible versions ready.

For me that MagSafe ring is essential"
51293,"Apple Silicone Case (Red). I've been using variants of these for years, having switched between silicone and leather. Last one I bought was the leather folio, and didn't really find the price justified. So I'm going back to the standard silicone.

I would have gotten the clear case if it didn't have that disgusting ring pattern on the back."
51294,"I ordered this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09C1L2P4X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I have it on the 11 Pro Max. What I like about it is its super thin and it has cutouts around all the buttons instead of the like ""protruding"" buttons that push on the phone buttons. I've always hated those."
51295,"Are they always coloured this semi-transparent?
Because on their website you can only buy a black one but the pictures are the same on Amazon with this transparent Design"
51390,Slippery?
51297,"Mous Limitless 4.0. Hands down the best case I‚Äôve ever had, a little pricey but definitely worth it.

Had the black leather for the 12, going to try out their speckled fabric design for the 13."
51298,"How did the leather hold up?

I've had a Nomad this past year and the leather is awful."
51299,"https://i.imgur.com/CiOPmAT.jpg 

Very happy with how it‚Äôs held up. Had both the leather and silicon Apple cases previously which have fell apart in no time compared."
51300,"I ordered the dark cherry for my gold 13 pro. I was hoping that pacific blue would still be a color but alas. Sticking with that same old gold for the next 3 years haha

Edit: I‚Äôm also grabbing the wisteria wallet to really just go full on with the purple and gold royal look"
51301,"Spigen‚Äôs thin fit with their stick-on kick stand for my pro max. Once their slim armor with the built in kick stand comes out I‚Äôll get that. 

If anyone else is looking at Spigen cases buy them on Amazon. They‚Äôre 1/3 the price."
51302,"Smartish Gripmunk. The clear version because I‚Äôm rocking the Gold model. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097QBNK23/

I used to do Apple OEM cases but they fall apart with a few months use and they are overpriced, IMHO.

The Spigen Ultra Hybrid cases are pretty good too, but not as grippy and I don‚Äôt like having the translucent lip of the case around the screen. Messes with the eyes. 

The Spigen Liquid Air is another model I like a lot.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096HVKHPT/"
51303,"The silicone cases were a total miss this time around imo, I would‚Äôve absolutely loved the pistachio or cloud blue silicone case the 12‚Äôs had paired with the Sierra Blue iPhone. 

So I just went with the Black/White (even though it‚Äôs actually blue) version of the OtterBox Figura Series Case ( https://store.apple.com/xc/product/HPRN2ZM/A ) I‚Äôve heard it isn‚Äôt very protective but I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs third party one‚Äôs that come out soon that I like and are bit more protective :)"
51304,Ordered the Wisteria Apple leather case for my Sierra Blue 13 Pro. [Case arrived on Thursday and I love it. ](https://imgur.com/a/cRzI3zs)
51305,Do you have any experience with the 12 series leather case and do you feel any difference from that to the 13? I had the 12 one and it wasn‚Äôt that good
51306,I only have experience with the 11 Pro leather case which I heard was much better than the 12 Pro leather case. I'm hoping Apple fixed the issues with the 13 Pro leather case. It feels nice in the hand but I guess only time will tell all.
51307,Why dont the 13 cases have a cut out at the bottom so its easier to swipe up?  That was my favorite feature on my 10's cases.
51308,"I immediately ordered the light pink Apple silicone case as a safe option, but [this one from Casetify](https://i.imgur.com/9C8fD9L.jpg) is arriving next month! It's a clear case with MagSafe. I thought the clouds would look so cute on the sierra blue! 

I'm also very interested in [the Otter+Pop cases](https://i.imgur.com/Mjhg48i.jpg) though. Super sturdy and I've had a popsocket for over 3 years, wouldn't want to go without now... 

And [the Otterbox Figura cases](https://imgur.com/a/oyGriqs/) have also caught my eye üëÄ They look so interesting! And I love that they have MagSafe in there."
51309,Their pop cases are intriguing.  I would get one if it didn't mean the loss of MagSafe.
51310,"Popsocket themselves now have a MagSafe Popsocket (so it's removable), might want to look into that!"
51312,These are pretty sweet
51313,I was also gonna get pink silicone but I ended up ordering the OtterBox Figura Case (the second  one in that link) I may have to pick that cloud one up though! It looks amazing I‚Äôm just always worried about third party clear cases yellowing pretty quickly
51314,"In my experience with the Otterbox clear cases, the entire back of it doesn't discolor at all but the flexible part (the sides that go around the button etc) does change color a bit. I didn't find it ugly, but I did notice it in the end!"
51315,"Spigen Hybrid initially (yoloing and picking up my order while on vacation), but will also be ordering a dbrand grip case for use afterwards"
51316,"Decided on the Spigen Ultra Hybrid with magsafe as the clear apple case last year was an accident waiting to happen. Apples leather was also terrible last year, with one case chunking in months and the replacement snapping by the volume buttons this week.

51317,"I ordered this first thing this morning, and I swear I was seeing their stock drop before my eyes."
51319,Out of stock now lol
51320,"I‚Äôve been using Spigen since the 6S (I think), so I‚Äôve decided to continue the tradition due to having no issues.

I‚Äôve also gone for the Ultra Hybrid, but the one without the MagSafe circle on the back (I can‚Äôt stand it‚Ä¶it just looks like a bad sticker), as it‚Äôs still MagSafe compatible and half the price (in the U.K.)."
51321,I‚Äôm waiting for the dark colored ring case to come off back order. Should be here late September. Then it wont stand out!
51322,"Nice! As I‚Äôve gone for Sierra Blue I‚Äôm quite limited in options unless they end up doing a colour matched version. My case arrived today, now to play the waiting game!"
51323,"I was going to wait for that one, but I decided that I‚Äôll probably be using the MagSafe popsocket often enough to not notice it."
51324,Ordered the same case. I‚Äôve been using Spigen cases for years. Great case for the money.
51325,"Have you used these clear cases before? They tend to go yellow pretty fast

I think I will go for spigen liquid armour navy blue"
