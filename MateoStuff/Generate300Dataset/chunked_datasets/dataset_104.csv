33180,"I drink Rockstar once in a while, but for taste. It doesn't really seem to do anything for me energy-wise."
33181,"Michael Savage and his family own Rockstar energy drinks.  If you don't know know who Michael Savage is, he's a Rush Limbaugh/Glenn Beck wannabe based out of San Francisco probably most famous for saying thinks like:

33182,"Still tasty, thanks."
33183,No they're all horrible and will kill you even if you drink only one do not subject yourself to that horror i've seen things you can't even imagine
33184,No. I only drink water.
33185,"I used to when I worked third shift. Now I usually drink them if I have to drive for an extended period of time or have to be up very late and need a clear head. I found that the situations where I felt like I needed an energy boost before are gone because I am eating healthier now, and more active than I used to be. Now I see them more as a mixer than something to keep me awake."
33186,"Definitely go for a test drive.  That's sometimes difficult in a Tesla, but see if you can find the local EV owners group and ask if anyone is willing to let you drive their car.  Sounds odd, but generally Tesla owners love to let people test out the cars (perhaps less so right now with COVID, the other option is Turo)

Also talk to the local dealers for the other EVs.  Some dealers are great about EV sales, some are truly awful.   I would not buy an EV from a dealer that doesn't want to sell one."
33187,"Turo! It's not free, it was so much better to test for 3 days instead of 30 minutes."
33188,"Turo is still banned in all of New york state since 2013 :(

I'd test drive something every other weekend if I could"
33190,"That's understandable! I think the prestige and status that comes with a Tesla Model 3 is really appealing to me in addition to the high-tech innovation. It just seems like it's cutting edge.

But this post has definitely opened my eyes to some good alternatives worth considering."
33192,5 locations in the city isnt too bad. I have 9 in the whole country (Austria)
33193,"Thank you for the great comment! I agree that test driving these cars will be a good way to decide which one I like best. You make a good point about the price difference. I wasn't aware of the tax credit, so that certainly does change things. 

5 superchargers is actually quite a bit in one city IMO. But I understand your point. I guess the difference is that superchargers seem to be more reliable and faster than other chargers, but I may also be biased.

What made you decide to go with the Niro over the Model 3?"
33194,"What does ""they are discounting 10k off easy"" mean? I'm a prospective buyer so am curious how I'd get that discount if I went with Chevy."
33195,"Well, here's an example...

$39k MSRP selling for $26k. Then you'll go into the dealership and visit 5 other dealerships and haggle for a week to get them to honor their advertised price, walk out several times, curse your salesman, pull your hair out, wish that dealerships would just DIE, and finally end up buying the car for something around $10k off."
33196,Polestar 2 should be available by then.  Competitive with higher end Model 3s.
33197,"I checked out the Polestar 2 recently (online) and it looks pretty awesome. Definitely more expensive than what I'd like, but with the federal tax incentive and potentially the state incentive, it would bring it down to about the same as a LR Model 3. Definitely worth considering... I just wonder if there will be issues that come out later on about the Polestar 2 like there have been with Tesla (mostly referring to customer service experience)."
33198,I believe they will sold and serviced by your local Volvo dealership.
33200,"Thanks for the tips! Since I live in an apartment, would you consider the charging the apartment offers to be home charging? I'm guessing so, but just wanted to double check.

How do you know DCFC sessions aren't good for the battery? Do you have any articles you can share?"
33201,"Sure! Yes, the main thing is that you have ample access to an outlet or charging station. 

https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/

With a modern liquid-cooled battery (like in the cars you’re looking at), I wouldn’t worry too much about DCFC or the impact of weather. Anecdotally, I have nearly 100 sessions with virtually no degradation. 

The main point is convenience. Having your own outlet removes a major annoyance of car ownership."
33202,"That was a terrific article and answered a lot of the questions I had! Thank you for sharing it. 

It seems like hot weather and frequent DCFC does negatively impact the battery, so I definitely want to be careful with that. Relying primarily on using superchargers wouldn't be an option for me then. I agree with your comment on convenience, which is why I am planning to move to an apartment with EV charging before getting an EV."
33203,"There are people that Supercharge exclusively. The highest mileage Model 3 (probably upwards of 140k miles by now) famously had 2% degradation @ 100k miles on Supecharging alone. Here in EP (suuuuper hot) we're at about 309/310 miles after 1.5 years/20k miles. But again, anecdotal evidence.

Good luck with the move! Plugshare shows a few apartment complexes in Dallas with EV chargers. If you're dealing with the owner directly you could probably ask them about adding an outlet (worked for us!)"
33204,Check with the apartment to make sure you have lots of access a dedicated level 1 beats shared level 2
33205,"Kona, E Niro, Soul, ID4 are some other options. The i3 are a bit old. Here in Europe they practically gift them away at 150€/month leading and 21k Euros for the base price. If costs are the same, definitely go.for the model 3."
33206,"Tesla allowed me to do an overnight test drive of a Model 3.  You may not be able to do so on a weekend, but you should certainly be able to do so on a Monday-Thursday.  I picked up the car at 2PM on a Wednesday and dropped it off at 9:00AM the next morning.  I drove about 150 miles and tested out a Supercharger."
33207,"That sounds perfect! I'll definitely check that out. I have a friend with a Model 3 who has said she would let me test drive it, but it would be cool to have one overnight to see how it would fit into my lifestyle. Thanks!"
33208,"You can also ask them to drop the car off at your home, saving you a trip to Tesla.  They offered for me."
33209,Perfect! Thanks for the tip!
33210,"Nissan Leaf fits certain use cases.  Depending on tax credits and daily miles, the budget numbers might make sense.  Build quality is well Nissan, not an issue.

In a Leaf lease right now and the next one will be a used Leaf plus or a Tesla but that's a budget stretch, considering my relatively low per day mile use case.

If Tesla battery day has some cool tech announcements on charging/longevity, man, Tesla is the one to beat.  That supercharger network has appeal, esp for one car households and in your case, limited charging at home.  

(Note: Previous car was a leased Chevy Volt plug in, 1st gen (really liked that car) and before was a Honda Accord (also a trouble free car but not EV at all so meh)."
33211,"Volkswagen ID3 and ID4 and their Skoda, SEAT, and Cupra equivalents are strong contenders. As is Mustang Mach-E.

Audi, BMW, and Mercedes also bring new cars next year.

Out of those, I am currently most interested in the Mach-E. Though it is unlikely I can afford a car that costs more than 40k€, and they all pretty much do because of how much taxes we need to pay for a car."
33212,"I dont know why anyone who lives or works  in a metropolitan area would want a brand new car of any kind. People in Boston for example are magnetically attracted to parking next to new cars, apparently so they can open their door too wide and dent the hell out of them. Or just slam into them from behind when parallel parking. This is not just my last new car, I saw this every day before the pandemic started. Apparently most humans don't understand how momentum  works.

I'd consider a used Tesla if you're going to get one; at least you know any kinks have been worked out,  plus insurance and any state excise tax bill will be lower.

I recommend the site https://ev-cpo.com"
33213,"I certainly understand that sentiment and agree with you in principle. I live in Dallas, TX and the drivers here are horrible and I know I would be terrified of people damaging my car. 

However, I have looked up used Teslas before and they seem to be about the same price as a new one. I don't really understand why that is, but they clearly have great resell value. So then I think to myself that I might as well just buy a new vehicle if they're about the same. The good thing about the Model 3 is that it's been out for a while and they have gotten most of the issues resolved."
33214,"This is a good point. I was going to say that you'd also benefit from buying new in terms of rebates and other EV purchase  incentives,  but looking into it it seems TX does not allow Tesla to get rebates due to being a direct sales company vs an in-state dealership :("
33215,I know... It really sucks that this is the case in TX. Hoping they will allow in-state dealerships now that Tesla is building a factory near Austin.
33216,The Texas rebate expires at the end of the year anyway.
33217,">Innovation and Technology (OTA updates, FSD/AP)

Of note, others have full-vehicle OTA. Mustang Mach-E will have full-vehicle OTA and true ""hands free"" driving mode unlike current AP. 

>Long range and Supercharger network

Do look up the CCS chargers on your route - there are CCS chargers more convenient than Superchargers in some parts of the country. 

&#x200B;

I own a Model 3 myself, and I ordered a Mustang Mach-E to upgrade from the 3 later this year. I don't hate the 3, but the Mustang Mach-E looks infinitely better to me, has far better service network (nearest Ford dealer is 500ft from my house, nearest Tesla Service Center is 50 miles away), and charges basically just as fast (150 kW) and CCS chargers are more plentiful on the routes I travel."
33218,"Careful with the CSS chargers.   
There are not more CCS chargers, there are more locations.
They are not optimally spaced across the country.
They speed of CCS varies greatly.
They are often broken.
Integration into the car is non existent.
Payment integration is clunky.

The other cars he mentioned max at like 50-75kw so long charging times even if he finds a working ccs station.

Edit:  there are people that live 500ft from a tesla dealer.   Also no one owns a Mach e yet so we don’t know any real world numbers."
33219,"That's why I said to check where you are. Where I am and where I go, there are far more CCS chargers than Superchargers - but as I said, that isn't true everywhere. 

There's nothing wrong with buying a Tesla, I just look forward to not being dependent on their walled charging garden."
33220,If it is someone only car though you don’t have the freedom with ccs but if he doesn’t go anywhere then why even get a car.
33221,You have tons of freedom with CCS. I am selling my Model 3 for a Mustang Mach-E and there will be no reduction of my freedom. Not everyone lives where CCS sucks and Tesla is good.
33222,"The only place that would suck is if you live in/travel through the northern central-ish states like Montana, Wyoming, N/S Dakota where superchargers are more common, and you won't be screwed if the ONE CCS plug that is supposed to be working, isn't.

The massive supercharger station at West Yellowstone was a masterstroke..."
33223,+1 for tesla anything. highest shelf model you can reach comfortably budget wise.
33224,Be aware of Tesla’s problems with QC
33225,"Definitely aware of Tesla's QC problems and they definitely concern me. I'm hoping they get better with time. But QC is also one of the reasons I am more interested in the Model 3 than the Y. It seems they have more time to improve their processes and issues the longer the car is on the market. Granted, a lot of these issues would probably be avoidable with better QC in the first place..."
33226,"Time hasn’t helped them fix the bumper design flaw as the recent puddle incident video seems to show.

QC and all their issues are the main reasons that kept me from buying a Model 3."
33227,"Yeah, I saw that post. Yikes... That's not a good look. 😬😒"
33228,The Hyundai Ioniq will handle your 300 mile trips but a little leisurely as the fast charge speed was reduced for the liquid cooled battery and 170-mile range (which is a real world range and not just a hopeful estimate). It's going to be the cheapest option and has more cargo room than the model 3.
33229,Ignore this comment.  I meant to post this as a reply to another user.
33230,"I wish they made the Toyota pickup truck from the 80's and early 90's again, in EV or hybrid. So light, small and practical."
33231,seriously! Me too. Would love to see a small pickup as an EV.
33232,Expect a ev ford maverick soonish. The hybrid looks nice as well.  If they had an EV Maverick coming out now. I'd snatch it up.
33233,"I'm in a similar boat. Want an EV for woodworking and home improvement.

I'm likely getting an f150 lightning. However, I'm probably opting for the 40k pro model. Which may or may service you as well if it's your only car given the range.

The reason I'd get the pro model is because the long range is going to be at least 63k. Which is an XLT. The lariat is 80k. And there very little a standard range XLT has over the Pro for me. I don't think the trucks worth that price, and it's mainly because of the DC charge speed. if I got the expensive model, it'd be the primary family road trip car as well. But at only 150kw max charge speed. For a 400 mile trip, that's an hour and a half of charging added to the trip. Not acceptable in my book. I would say their DC charge speed is already dated. 

The 80K lariat is on par with the specs of the 67k rivian. Only key difference is the bed size which can still hold a sheet of plywood flat, it'll just have slightly more overhang than the f150. 

The rivian is the better deal at that price point and it has faster charging, which would cut charge times in half.

I was initially going to get the Rivian, but based on my reservation date, I wouldn't probably be offered one for purchase until 2023. I expect to be first in line for the f150. 

For Rivian, i think it's entirely possible they come out with a better build of a truck than ford. And service can be better unless you are not near a major city. 

The only other truck to keep an eye out for is GM. They should reveal it later this year, but I doubt theyd be lauching it in 2022. 

Ordering an f150 this fall should be risk free and you'd have until delivery to accually purchase it. So if something better comes up, you can change your mind next spring."
33234,">I'm likely getting an f150 lightning. However, I'm probably opting for the 40k pro model.


>I expect to be first in line for the f150.

Why do you think you'll be first in line if you ordered a Pro model?  I was under the impression that the high-margin trims will be prioritized unless it's a fleet order.

I also put in my reservation for a Pro, I just don't expect it to be available until Q3 of 2022.

As an aside, I'd still rather have the single-motor Cybertruck for the same $40k, but there's virtually no chance it will be available to me before the F150L."
33235,"First in line because I reserved like 10 minutes into the presentation of the reveal. So I'm probably within the first 10k.

Ford has been pretty clear that they will sell the Pro model alongside other trims to consumers. You just cannot get extended range as a consumer, to get that they force you into the higher prices trims.

A recent ford event noted that most reservation interest is for higher trims, so they don't need to force the higher margin more than they already do. Lots of people who buy trucks already are spending 50k+.

I would take a Tesla as well and deal with the monstrosity that it is... I have a pre order for it as well. But I wouldn't expect a purchase until 2024 given my preorder date and they already delayed into 2022.  I would take a duel motor as it's a great value. I had initially thought single motor but I honestly doubt theyd ever produce it... If they do it's probably past 2024 :)"
33236,"yeah that’s where I’m at. 

I was especially impressed by reports the base model range is calculated while pulling a half ton load. Empty the range is 400+."
33237,"Any range estimates you saw are not accurate, if you think they are that far off you'll likely get disappointed later on :)

The EPA ranges are 230, and 300, respectively. If they were higher (400+), they would have lead with that.  EVs are very sensitive to drive styles and weather -- so range can vary a lot from people to person and what the previous drive was like.

But, I would personally run with expecting ~190, ~250  range @ freeway speeds (~70MPH, worse if you're going faster). The EPA range is a mix of City/Freeway (45%,55%).

If you're only city driving, in mild temperatures, you can see higher ranges but that's not really where people care about range. 

If you take an more optimistic view-point and you carry over the Mach-E as an example, you may see the following:

EPA @ 300, Highway Range @ 315

EPA @ 230, Highway range @ 240

But, I probably wouldn't carry that over as it's kind of the exception to the rule. Plus, the Size of an F150 is going to really drag down range @ speed. But, if those do pan out, it would be a happy surprise and really make the truck that much better."
33238,"How do you know they are inaccurate?

The EPA range estimate on the Lightning is rated while pulling a 1000 lbs load. This way people who buy the truck who pull trailers won't see their range drop like a rock. Ford is underpromising and overdelivering on range. It has a huge battery. Read the fine print.

There are multiple reports from independent people that the range is in the 350-450 range without a load. Given the size of the batteries, this would not surprise me at all. That's with the extended range battery. I imagine the basic one has a stated range of 230 and will likely get in the 300 or so empty. 

The size of vehicle isn't going to impact highway range that much.

33239,"F-150 range was not calculated while pulling a trailer. Just put that thought out of your mind. Some reports claim it's with 1000 lbs ""on board"", i.e. in the bed, but even that is sketchy. And a half ton in the bed wouldn't make much difference on the highway, anyway, which is where range matters.

I've not seen one reliable report of 400 mile range, just speculation. Look at the price of each Mach E variant, then add 6-12k of extra battery cost to get the same range in F-150."
33240,"Right....so because some random dude on the internet tells me to ""put it out of my mind"" I should ignore all the reliable reports that say otherwise. Super convincing."
33241,"Your Electrek article says: ""Ford told Marques Brownlee, a prolific tech YouTuber, that the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck’s 300-mile range is their expectation of the estimated EPA range with 1,000 lbs of cargo.""

Nobody said one thing about a trailer. They clearly meant 1000 lbs in the bed/cabin, which will only affect range by 5-10%. And a 367 mile range estimate on the display means nothing. It was a prototype, which might not have been calibrated yet. Or might have had an oversized battery. Or might have been driven slowly from 100-80% SOC (some displays estimate range based on recent driving conditions). It might have even been set to metric, lol.

Ford says the Pro will get 230 miles EPA. It'll probably come in 10-20 miles higher. And will get maybe 200 miles at 70 mph, and more like 125 miles when towing a full height, lightweight trailer. It still looks like a great truck, just don't buy into the 400 mile hype."
33242,"**How do you know they are inaccurate?**

Basic understanding of EV ranges, basically the size of a battery needed to achieve the range given the efficiency of a Truck that size. Batteries are in very short supply. They cannot be putting in a 200kwH+ battery into this Truck to get 400+ range. 

A Tesla Model Y is consumption is ~3.35 mi/kwh at freeway speeds; with it's 75kWh  battery size, you can roughly expect 250 miles range on the freeway. The consumption is based on the size, weight and aerodynamics of a car. 

The F150 is expected to be at ~1.61 mi/kwh at freeway speeds (bigger, heavier and not aerodynamic). To get 400 range, you would need a battery the ~250kWh. With the battery being a constrained resource and the biggest cost of an EV (usually half the price of a car), that is basically like making 3-4 Tesla Model Ys.  The hummer ev has a battery @ 200kWh, and with a price tag to match $112K.

Estimates for F150 battery size are: 

~115kWh for standard, and ~155kWh for extended range.

Let's give F150 a best case scenario for efficiency with 2 miles/kwh --- @ 155kWh battery size that's ~300 miles range. Want AC, less range; Drive in cold weather <40 Degrees, less range. But, for a more expected value, 250 miles @ freeway speeds is expected. 

So, unless Ford has managed to make an EV battery cheaper than anyone else, and managed to source an unlimited supply. Don't expect 400+ range. 


**There are multiple reports from independent people that the range is in the 350-450 range without a load.**

No there are not. Some Youtuber's managed to navigate to the range guestimator while doing walkthroughs on a prototype vehicle and noted what they saw for a Truck that was dropped off to them. No one drove it. Zero relevance to actual ranges for a Production vehicle. ""Accurate"" range calcs are likely not developed for F150 yet. Truck is still ~6-12 months out. They likely won't submit to EPA until next year when they actually develop a production vehicle. They note on their site these won't be available until 2022. 

**The size of vehicle isn't going to impact highway range that much.**

Umm, for an EV that's pretty much the most important factor. Basic physics -- the bigger the size the more drag the faster you go which reduces range. For reference, the Tesla Model Y is 8% less efficient than the Model 3 due to the size and that's with two very aerodynamic cars.  

https://www.audi.com/en/experience-audi/mobility-and-trends/e-mobility/e-tron-aerodynamic.html

""Our job becomes more challenging. Because good aerodynamics and low air resistance are even more important for electric cars. Essentially, you have significantly less energy available overall than you do with vehicles powered by a combustion engine. So we need to optimize efficiency in every area. And one area in particular is air resistance in constant driving conditions at constant speed, such as on freeways.""

Everything is done to improve the range of an EV (including the type of hubcap), because of how much aerodynamics affect EV range. 

Again if you're thinking you'll see 350-450 range from this Truck, you'll be disappointed. Ford can be sandbagging but not by 50%."
33243,"As someone who’s owned plenty of Fords, I’d avoid the first year of any Ford product.  Just go look at the recent news about the Bronco and its disastrous rollout, tons of issues, and some customers who ordered early this year, won’t get their cars until end of next year.  And Ford and dealers have been jerking around customers for months. The Explorer rollout was also a disaster.  

I honestly wouldn’t trust them to deliver the Lightning in a timely manner.  It’s a cool vehicle no doubt, but I’d give it a couple of years of being on market before I’d pull the trigger on it.  They just don’t have the best reputation with new release vehicles lately"
33244,"Fair. But unlike say, avoiding a first year Apple product (which I always do) avoiding a first year EV means waiting probably 4-5 years before anything suitable comes out."
33245,not sure why you got downvoted... heres an upvote for just puting yourself out there

33248,"I'm not even a truck person, and I want a Lightning. 

Bidirectional charging is a huge leap forward in EV technology and is truly the killer app for this thing. I am thinking about giving up my Mustang just for the bidirectional charging on the Lightning, to push the technology forward."
33249,"That’s the thing! I’m not a truck person or a Ford person. I never thought I would even consider it. 

My solar array has a battery so bidirectional charging is less of a perk although still cool! Being able to power a camper or job site though is amazing."
33250,"We just had thunderstorms rip through last week, something like 700,000 people were without power for 3-4 days. Luckily, my lights stayed on. But many friends and coworkers didn't, and fridges got emptied and thrown away, etc. 

If something like that happened with a Lightning in the driveway, I could keep everything running for a week, and that's without popping over to a public charging station (all of which did keep power or had it quickly restored) to top up and bring a fresh ""tank"" of electricity back to the house."
33251,"Yeah that’s going to be a game changer going forward. Coupled with solar and more electric vehicles it will change the way people respond to disasters. 

The day after I ordered my solar my power got knocked out by a storm."
33252,"You would need solar to fully realize that feature.  Otherwise you'd be draining your truck's battery, decreasing it's available range per day and needing to find a public charger after a few days."
33253,I have solar. But really you wouldn't. In a power outage you could run your house for a few days (at least essentials) and then once the power came back on could charge your truck from the grid.
33254,"Yes, if it's just a few days of no power and you don't need to actually drive your truck anywhere.

Personally, considering the battery backup feature is only with the highest end Lightning package (which is like $90k+), I'd rather get a cheaper Lightning, and buy an actual battery backup for home solar which will work 24/7 and allow me to drive my truck whenever."
33255,"It's not at all what you said, they've said it's standard with the big battery, not the $90k version."
33256,Seems you're right.  If every Lightning can do it that is definitely nice.
33257,"Yeah absolutely and that's what I'm doing, but generally speaking I can see how this would appeal to some people."

33264,"An important benefit is to be able to use the battery in your car to power your home during an extended power outage, or at least keep your refrigerator and a few other things running. Traditionally that required a noisy and polluting gas generator, which not everyone has and requires maintenance. Or you can spend many thousands of dollars for a ""whole house battery,"" but why do that when your car has a much bigger battery in it? 

Depending how much energy you use, today's EVs could easily run a whole house for a couple of days, or longer if you cut your consumption."
33265,"Vehicle batteries can support a lot for a long time. I can run my house for a week off a Lightning. 

I see this as the killer app for BEV adoption. I don't see a reason not to want it. It's going to become a baseline expectation of new EVs."
33266,"I'm guessing there are people that live in places with frequent and extended power outages. In the last 30 years where I live I've never lost power for more than 30 minutes and that happened once in that time. I live in the midwest with storms during the summer months and ice and snow in the winters. But the part of the city I live in has most all the electrical lines running underground. So any outages we've had were usually some transformer that blew which gets fixed rather quickly or rolls over to some other segment of the grid.

So for me I wouldn't buy something for that particular feature because I would likely never use it. But there are older parts of the city I'm in where every year people experience extended power outages from summer storms or ice in the winter. Might make sense for them to have something like this. Though the reality is the people in those areas of the city likely can't afford something like a Ford Lightning."
33267,Hurricanes can cause multi week power outages
33268,"Where I grew up we would see 2-4 power outages a year that generally lasted a few hours to a couple days. In those situations, having the ability to keep your essential appliances (fridge, freezer, central air) online would be amazing. 

The Ford Lightning can power a standard home for up to three days and I imagine just essentials like a fridge for much longer. 

It's not valuable to me since I have solar and a battery already, but for people who experience power outages on a regular basis and don't already have a battery, it's very valuable."
33269,"How heavy a trailer?  If the Rav4 Hybrid meets your needs then there are a few options that will pull ~3500ish +/-.  I could regurgitate but summarized by just googling ev towing or something like:

https://automotivemap.com/electric-vehicle-towing-capacity-2021-2652872833.html?rebelltitem=11#rebelltitem11

If you will need 5000+ options shrink, only existing one is Model X I think.  Then soon the Lightning, Rivians, etc.

I'm in this self debate where I want to move to an EV but need to tow 5000+ occasionally.  Not sure if I just keep my current truck since it's getting older/higher mileage/low trade in value anyway and get a new daily, or wait for one of the newer 5000+ options but they could be a year or two out for even a first year model at this point,  let alone waiting for revisions.

I go back and forth all the time.  I  kinda wish my boat was a little lighter and could be handled by a Model Y which would make it a lot easier."
33270,"Right now I just pull a light, 5x8' trailer with a couple motorcycles on it and stuff like lumber and drywall. So I don't need anything that big but may want something bigger in the future. I'll take a look at the towing map there. I don't think I'll need to tow 5000+ ever."
33271,"The crazy thing is the Model Y could probably do my pulling for me but by the time I price it out with the towing kit it's almost 20k more than the Lightning (once you consider tax benefits as well). With tax credits, the Lightning could be as low as $35k or so, give or take, while I just priced out the Model Y I would need and was in spitting distance of $60k. Only benefit is I'd be able to walk away with a Model Y sooner. 

If the Cybertruck was actually available now I'd consider it."
33272,"Yeah, if trying to stay around 35-40k, I think the ID.4 might be your current best bet (other than waiting).

""A 2021 Volkswagen ID. 4 can pull a braked trailer weighing up to 2,200 pounds and unbraked loads of up to 1,650 pounds.""

Apparently pretty well received, but no frunk if that matters, no real one pedal driving if that matters, have heard they're not as ""fun"" as some other options but maybe doesn't matter, etc.  You'd have to research based on what you prefer and maybe just test one."
33273,I'll check it out! Thanks!
33274,"‘…I can’t see any midsize trucks on the horizon…’

The Rivian RT1 is smaller than the Lightning. But it’s big $. 

Would a VW ID4 have enough storage space? That may be an option."
33275,"Yeah I looked into the Rivian. Too expensive and it’s a startup without a track record of reliability or ability to build enough in sustained numbers. I’m a fan, but not ready to trust them yet. 

If the ID4 was significantly cheaper I would consider it, but it starts at the same price as the Lightning without the towing package and has less range, doesn’t have some of the features of the Lightning like exterior plugs. So at that point I might as well go with a Ford. At this point I’d pay more and end up with something less capable."
33276,"The ID4 is the same price as a Lightning?! Lucky you I suppose. 

I’m in Canada. The Lightning starts at $68k and the ID4 is $45k. Little bit different."
33277,Oh yeah. In the US they both start at $39k USD.
33278,"That's the commercial stripper...

Many of the features discussed here aren't on the $39k model."
33279,Such as? I was looking at the base model and I don’t see anything specific that wasn’t included. What features were you referring to?
33280,"Last I saw, not interested in trucks...
No truck to home... small battery.. vinyl. And on and on.. it's truly for commercial work.

As well, where I'm from you only have a truck if it can pay for itself. I just don't have the work for it.  Nor do I need a rolling cod piece... but that's me.."
33281,"Fair. The truck to home is an added feature but one I don’t really care about as my solar system has a battery, so it’s unlikely I’d use it. The battery on the base model is “small” but still rated at 230 miles while pulling 1000 pounds, and up to 400+ miles empty. 

Again, I looked at the base model and didn’t really see much that I would want to pay more for. I have a side hustle handyman business of sorts so it will most likely pay for itself."
33282,"Well, it can earn its keep!
Be a tax write off.

And 

A lot less to feed!"
33283,For sure! Considering the tax write off for my solar system and my school I won’t be paying taxes for awhile! Haha
33284,Import tarrifs are a bitch n a half
33285,"I'd agree with the above that it's ID.4 vs. F-150.  I suggest:

* Price out both, really looking seriously at what options you would get.

* Also look at kWh/mi and consider what that would cost you, paying for electricity or for buying a bigger solar array.

Both are great vehicles and great values.

Consider also that the F-150 is a lot more likely to lethal to a pedestrian in a crash.  It should be driven slower and more carefully if you are in a neighborhood or downtown area."
33286,thanks. I already calculated it into my solar array so besides the occasional trip paying for power won’t be an issue.
33287,"Isn't that the bare bones, commercial Lightning which starts at the lowest price?  Is that the one you plan on getting?

I think the battery backup feature is only for the highest end Lightning trim."
33288,It is the bare bones one. I don't know if that's the one I'll end up getting but so far I'm not seeing anything major on the other models that I would want. The battery backup features doesn't interest me (I have a solar system with a battery).
33289,"The best EV you can buy in 2022 is the Tesla Model Y with the 4680 batteries and the new frame construction. I am sure some will ship in 2022 but certainly 2023.

I am not convinced that Ford can mass produce EVs at this point (I do not think they can build more than 75K a year) and they will remain battery constrained until the Ford/SK plant goes online in 2025."
33290,"As I mentioned in another comment that would be almost twice the cost of the Ford. 
Why are you convinced of that?"
33291,"I do not think most will be buying the base model with the little battery but will opt for one of the higher priced models, so by the time the dealer gets some of that $12.5K government tax rebate by increasing the price a couple thousand, most buyers will be \~$60K. Now there will be a lot of people standing in line for this truck and they will probably have an ICE F-150 to trade in which will drop in price (the dealer does not want an item he cannot sell) since you can buy the Lightning for less $$ than a used ICE F-150. So the buyer will lose $$ on their trade in and the dealer will mark up the price because of the govt rebate.No legacy car manufacturer has proven they can mass produce an EV and all will be battery constrained. Who of the 700K buyers of the F-150 are going to want to buy a new ICE F-150 in 2022 when you can buy the EV F-150 for less money. Ford certainly cannot manufacture 60K a month of the Lightning in 2022 or 2023. Also in late 2022 and at least by the first Q of 2023 Tesla will have two plants that begin production and one plant will be building the Cybertruck. Tesla could potentially build 150K or more in 2023."
33292,"You probably will be waiting on the Lightning as there are already tons of preorders and Ford will be constrained by chip and battery supplies like every one else unfortunately.  The lightning does look awesome though, EV Explorer/Expedition would be better!"
33293,I doubt they’ll be constrained that much. This is Ford. A year is plenty of time to mitigate those supply shortages.
33294,"That’s wishful thinking but the supply constraints are forecasted to last for years.  But crossing fingers.  Put your reservation in … 120K as of a month ago.  Probably more now:

https://fordauthority.com/2021/07/2022-ford-f-150-lightning-reservations-have-crossed-120k/

And production max capacity (with no supply constraints) is 80K/yr

https://fordauthority.com/2021/05/2022-ford-f-150-lightning-production-will-be-limited-in-first-year-on-market/"
33295,"A 50% of preorders turning into actual sales would be monster and great. I’m not saying I’ll be able to walk away with one on launch day, but I spoke to the Ford dealer today and they said they expect to get some no matter what. 

That said, I already preordered it awhile ago. No idea where I am in the queue but obviously not too late to back out, which is why I’m asking this question."
33296,"They already have thousands of trucks waiting for parts...


120k orders...

So yeah, a few years of their battery supply."
33297,It’s already been 6 months and things are no better. If you reserve today it’ll be a 2023 lightning.
33298,"Things are only bad in some areas. If you understand the chip shortage because of companies that made bad decisions in 2020. 

Also I already preordered."
33299,They had over a year with the Bronco and the release has been a disaster
33300,An EV Tacoma or Ranger would be dope.
33301,It’s too expensive too big for many people
33302,"Best value?  Multiple beater Leafs.  Next up from there is a Fiat 500e

Edit: I take everything back.  Go with the Spark EV."
33303,Throw spark EV in that as well.
33304,I feel only shame for forgetting about that thing.
33305,My 500e had a broken j1772 connector. Replacement part is $200. Labor is $3000. Skip.
33306,Labor on anything EV seems to be exorbitant.
33307,True. The problem with that particular issue was the need to remove the battery. The 500e platform requires the rear suspension to be removed to remove the battery. Bad design.
33308,There's no emergency disconnect for the high voltage battery?  On my C-Max you flip down the passenger side rear seat and yank the orange things.  Of course on a C-Max you also have to remove a good chunk of the forced air cooling system in order to replace the 12v less acid battery.  It's like 2 hours of labor.
33309,The cable/j1772 connector are one piece on the fiat. The only way to replace the connector is to replace the cable which attaches to the top of the battery. The battery has to be pulled to access it. There's no way around it.
33310,"Sweet Jesus, this must have been designed by the same people who make Ferraris."
33311,"Is the spark good? I've been looking for a bolt, but with the whole battery fiasco I realized I probably shouldn't get one right now. I was going to get a gas car (Chevy cruze) and drive it till I can get the bolt, but would the spark be a better option?? I don't know much about it so where is the best place to find info?"
33312,"They're fairly rare, but there aren't fire reports on them or the Volts like there are with the Bolts.  The Spark EV is famous for having an absurd amount of torque right off the line.

https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a25632693/chevy-spark-ev-used-car-deal/

Unlike gas powered motors, electric motors have their torque peak at 0 RPM.  Versus an embarrassingly long lost of vehicles for least for immediately off the line the Spark EV is king.  It quickly falls off to more normal acceleration past that so while it's no Model 3 Performance it also completely destroys a gas Spark for damn sure."
33313,What about the VW e-UP?
33314,"They don't have those in the land of Guns, God, and Covid.  But we do have the Spark EV which is supposed to kick entirely too much ass for what it is."
33315,it's actually very expensive for what it is. It's more than twice the price of a normal VW up
33316,In my case a 28kwh Ioniq had better value even if it was a little bit more expensive.
33317,Are you talking new or used?
33318,Both used.
33319,"The Nissan Leaf's recent price cuts combined with its continued eligibility for the federal tax credit make it an incredible value in the US*.

*assuming you're fine with chademo, live in a temperate climate, and have another car for road trips or rent a car for trips."
33320,"I used to recommend the Bolt EV hands down. It might still be, but I can't recommend it anymore ☹️"
33321,"Once the batteries are replaced, definitely."
33322,"Yes. But until then, it feels like it may be a hobbled car with, I suspect, a value that will fast depreciate until batteries are replaced."
33323,I don’t disagree with you in the interim… which is why I said “once the batteries are replaced”.
33324,Does GM need to replace every Bolt battery ever made or just repair them. Replacing them all would be mind blowing expensive.
33325,"They're going to replace the whole battery for all the 2017-2019s, and individual cells for 2020-2022.

It's definitely not going to be cheap.

However they don't even have the batteries made yet that they're going to use for replacing. They're not 100% confident LG has found the problem, nor how to guarantee it won't turn up again in production.

 So this will take years to fully roll out."
33326,"> It's definitely not going to be cheap.

Though if it's really a manufacturing defect, LGe is going to have to pay for it."
33327,"There’s currently no non-destructive way to know if a battery cell is good or not, so they’ll end up replacing them all. About $12k per car is what they’ve set aside."
33328,They only need to replace the ones that didn't burn yet.
33329,"Easily an electric bike, if there's one that meets your needs."
33330,"Uhm, have you looked at the prices? E-bikes are a lot of things, but good value isn't one of them."
33331,"You can get an e-bike for less than the cost of insuring any car for one year. I was mostly half joking, because OP is in the US where we have made every form of transportation that's not a personal car or truck or an airplane as difficult and bad as possible. But if it works (paved trails in the right places to avoid roads, etc), an e-bike combined with renting a couple times a year as needed is an amazing value!"

Wanna try watching the video now?"
33339,"I don't own a bike. I just hate liars.

You got caught out and now all you can do is slag."
33340,What sort of range and size do you need?
33341,"US, by the way. My work commute is 5 miles. I don’t put a ton of miles on my car. For longer trips, it’s all about charging stations."
33342,"If you wanted to go the cheap route, your daily commute would be easily covered by an used, older Leaf or another 'last-gen' EV like the Soul EV, Focus Electric, etc. but road trips would be rather difficult.

New, the Leaf or the MINI SE are both under $20k with state/fed incentives, but aren't great for long trips with their short ranges (and the Leaf's ChaDeMo).    
VW's ID.4 is a also pretty good deal with a 260mi range and a good amount of space for around $31k after incentives."
33343,Check out the Mini SE. Perfect for your commute.
33344,"If your work commute is 5 miles, then a PHEV work out great for you."
33345,"Phevs make no sense to me, because your still have all the potential issues and maintenance of the ICE."
33346,"Most modern ICE vehicles however will run 100k miles without any real issues quite easily. 

PHEV is a good middleground and a good way to make the switch for many people. It's a good car for someone who only wants one vehicle but also wants to get into electric."
33347,"And with 100k miles on the engine a PHEV could easily have 300k miles overall (personally I'm at 77% ev miles so far, I think the wheels will fall off before the engine dies)"
33348,"It will be hard, but find a used e-Golf and then rent cars for your road trips.  Id skip the Leaf because Chademo is going away.  If they ever fix the Bolt battery issue, that would be the best value.  You'd get a brand new batter in a 3-4 year old car.  Again, if you can find them you can get deals on the Kona/Niro/Ionique.  That was before the chip shortage."
33349,A used leaf with DC fast charge is the answer.
33350,"I don't know why they aren't brought up more often, but the BMW i3 is a great deal used. You can go full bev, range will be limited, or you can get one with a range extender which can be more helpful on long trips."
33351,It's still very expensive even when used and the tire size doesn't give me hopes of this car being built to last.
33352,"Personally, I got a '15 BEV for under 20k. For my driving, it's more than enough range. The tires are a consideration as they are not cheap to replace."
33353,Hyundai Ioniq EV or Kona EV (with recent price cut) are good values if you don't need a larger size vehicle.
33354,"The Ioniq Limited was surprisingly good, but just for the price, but in general. Memory seats/mirrors and moonroof were fantastic. ACC was the best I’ve ever used."
33355,Value as in cheap? Or value as is best package for your money?
33356,"The latter. But, I’ll never be in the Tesla $ range."
33357,Probably the best option right now is the base model ID4.  It also comes with 3 years of free charging on Electrify America.

I'm just waiting on my loan money coming through then one of them is mine.

Got the Exclusive Model for a little over £24k, with heaps getting taken off due to the Government Grant and their Affinity programme they're doing.

A 250+ Mile EV for that price is an absolute bargain."
33373,"I bought my e-Golf today for $20k.

There were near brand new leafs for $18K but I believe in CCS charging infrastructure to be more abundant than Chademo.

Plenty of older leafs with 40-70 miles of range ranging from 5-11k. You can also upgrade a leaf [with this company ](https://evridesllc.com/battery-upgrade-service/) and upgrade your range to 110 miles of range for $4500"

33375,"Kia E Soul, cheapest of the big range EVs with an amazing amount of features."
33376,VW ID4 S at $41k minus $7500 federal rebate makes it the best value EV on the market. Some states like NJ provide additional local rebates making it even more appealing.
33377,Yep! I got $7.5k off with federal incentive + saved $4k in taxes with state incentives.
33378,"Tough call, it seems people are only thinking short term. A car you want to keep forever may be the best value. 

I have a salesman friend that bought an early Model S, free supercharging, free fast internet, 8 year guarantee. About 250K miles on it now and this will be his last car, probably 20+ more years. 

Runs in the family, his dad still has a '40 Ford he bought as his first car."

Slightly more expensive up front than the others but better reliability/safety plus autopilot and access to supercharger network. 

Plus much less depreciation which saves money over time."

33382,"VW e-Golf. I just bought a '16 SE w/ the dc fast charging package for $14k. The range is limited so you have make sure it's going to meet your needs, but I've been impressed. The battery seems to have a really stable chemistry, mine is in amazing shape after 5 years and 40k miles."
33383,"Fiat 500e - $5k-10k depending on the year and mileage. 80 miles of range. Totally usable and not hideous, unlike the leafs. my family has had three going back seven years, and zero issues. Unbelievable value. 

Edit-obviously I’m talking about used cars here."

33389,100% Dacia Spring (if it ends up being decent enough in quality control).
33390,"Have you considered the Volt? For your commute it will be an EV, and for trips it will be just like your ice car. Great first ev imo."
33391,What range would you expect?
33392,"First gen 30-40 miles, second gen 50-60. 8 gallon gas tank will get you another 300+ miles."
33393,"Used? I think it’s the i3. That’s what I got after a lot of research. The bolt was slightly cheaper with more range, but I don’t think it should be recommended now."

33398,Only ones I actually expect to come out 2021 are the Mach E and Volkswagen ID. 4
33399,"Mach E and ID.4 both look like good entries in the EV market.  Ford and VW will have incentives to get these off the lot, let's see these on the road."
33400,"Of the electric trucks supposedly coming out, gm is the only one I would have any faith to deliver on that promise. 

Rivian has no production experience. They can make a few press vehicles but production is a different matter. Tesla still hasn’t shown off a legal version of the cyber truck. What they did show isn’t street legal under us law. Idk anything about lords town motors."
33401,Wasn’t Ford supposed to have an electric F-150 this year too? I know the hybrid is out but I thought the all electric was coming as well.
33402,The electric is going to be a year late as a 2022MY
33403,Fords ceo made it seem like it might come out this year when talking to Jay Leno on his YouTube channel
33404,I have faith in rivian
33406,"Yeah, I’d heard of their name for a long time but was dubious about whether they’d actually become a player in the EV market. That is, until Amazon contracted them."
33407,"Between the Amazon deal and don’t they have a tech deal with Ford or GM? 

Plus the fact of having the DSM/MMC factory with most of its equipment as a starting point for production. Mitsubishi pretty much just locked the door and left. It only closed in 2015 and Caterpillar has plants in nearby Peoria, so finding experienced workers shouldn’t be hard - especially if it’s a UAW shop.

Tesla had the NUMMI facility but I doubt Toyota and GM left as much in place.

I do think they’ll have distribution problems and they should consider an initial focus on fleet sales. Electric is ideal for last mile puttering around town deliveries. A few contracts with delivery companies could do a lot of good."
33408,"I don’t. I do t doubt they’ll try but they can’t compete with Ford, gm, Toyota, and ram. Hell, the truck market is extremely brand loyal as the Japanese have discovered the hard way. Rivian is an entirely new brand with NO dealership network or name doesn’t stand a chance."
33409,And yet here we are with the Tacoma. I honestly don’t get it. I had a Tundra but that love didn’t last. Partly because of me driving it into a river. But still.
33410,Faith. Good thing you didn't say that you believe in them. Then I'd have to ask you what you base that belief on. But faith can't be questioned.
33411,"True. I also believe in them to a degree. Most of that is due to their leadership, major investments and partnerships with Ford and Amazon, prototypes testing, and to be honest I do value the fact they are taking reservations and have a very polished ""brand"" including their website amd marketing (although i know they also took reservations for the cyber truck and semi and those are about as real as unicorns)"
33412,"Electric car development is so full of vaporware, I don't believe in anything until I see it for sale. I say that as somebody whose girlfriend bought a Bolt last month."
33413,"Thats fair, I dont blame you."
33414,"Considering the Hummer EV will start at $115,000 until 2024, I seriously doubt they'll be flying off the lot. Who wants to take a gamble on a first edition GM EV truck for $115k? Tesla got away with this by being a disruptor and having sleek styling, autopilot, etc, but GM isn't exactly known for quality or risk taking. 

I hope they have success with this but I bet they'll half-ass it like they do with almost everything else in the tradition of big, old, bloated corporations and it won't see much success."
33415,"Don’t forget GM will offer Chevy EV truck in the future. It’s supposed to be cheaper Hummer. 

What I see, GM is really serious in their EV effort. They’re creating the battery factory and working in many EV models. Their typical bureaucracy seems not affecting their program. 

Of course, I agree with you about the early quality and risk taking. The Corvette C8 is a good example."
33416,and the dick ugly Bolt is the first off the line.  Lame.
33417,"Some will definitely come, in addition to the GM ones. The truck market is so large in North America, one vehicle and everyone buys it from fleets to singles to families."
33418,"Yeah. Tesla will build something but not what they showed. Chevy will join the game after Ford does in 2022, ram might eventually hop in the rink with a ram once the trex prints enough money and I’m sure Toyota will have something too. 

Rivian and lodstown? Doubt it. No name, no production, no dealership, ect. They’ll get sold off, gutted for the tech and tossed aside."
33419,"Ram will more than likely be the last brand to offer a full EV. FCA (fuck stellantis) is behind the big 3 with EV development. Their saving grace is that EV tech is being designed in Europe for Fiat, Maserati, and PSA.

Once FCA gets their feet under them with the technology and can turn a profit, expect Ram to poach some tech to keep fighting Ford and GM. Ram already has some interesting hybrid technology on the docket for their trucks and Jeeps, so it won't be too far off."
33420,"Otoh, FCA was the first to offer a PHEV minivan back in 17"
33421,"They certainly did, but at a loss I'm sure due to low sales figures for the van."
33422,"Tbh, its probably in rams best interest to lag behind here. Let everyone else develop the tech and take the monumental task of marketing it to consumers. Sell yourselves as the traditional option. Then after consumers are convinced evs are good (they arent now), offer them a ram option. Its a win win for them."
33423,"It is and it isn't. You could stand to lose significant market share if customers start looking for an ev option in the future and you don't have a product for them.

Right now, EV's are all about getting new buyers and hoping they stay. Its why Tesla does all that goofy shit. They keep tech bro's and millennials interested due to the fact they offer cutting edge design while not taking themselves too seriously. 

Why would I want to drive a Leaf when a Tesla is the same car but with more ""fun features"" and therefore street cred? The same will be for new EV truck buyers. When you tell a guy he can buy a new Hummer that offers 1200 ftlb of torque while doing all sorts of crazy offroad stuff (crab walk, tank mode, etc) he suddenly is interested in it.

Then you tell people you can get a GMC Sierra with that technology, and folks start buying GMC. Now Ram doesn't have any offerings and they lose potential new customers to their competitors."
33424,"The thing about truck buyers though is that doesn't matter to a huge base of the customers. They buy the brand not the vehicle.

It doesn't matter that Ramis late to the party. They have a garunteed consumer base that wants the brand and a potential consumer base of anyone who gets burned by the inevitable teething issues electric will have. Once those are sorted out, ram spends a fraction of the cost gm and Ford did building the same truck they offer."
33425,Delorean
33427,"Bullshit. Tesla built a concept vehicle. It’s not street legal and to bitch about the hummer not being “functional” is nothing more than fanboy whining. Gm has a very long history of building and delivering a product. Tesla has a short history with a lot of delays. 

It’s also bullshit to say gm is far behind. They’ve delivered on bolt and have a very feasable vehicle in the hummer. The numbers theyve given for range are believable, the vehicle design is believable, and the price is expected. Gm has a much bigger supply chain than tesla does. 

You dont have to shill for tesla. Im no fan of gm vehicles but its not exacly controversial to say they they have a much longer history and a much bigger budget to make this happen on time than tesla."
33429,"Have you watched this? Basically answers why people say the Hummer is further along.

https://youtu.be/SC7q6e983cE

My 2 cents, i have no doubts each company will produce and sell these 2 vehicles. So it's really a question of which one will come out first (""which one is further along"" is kind of a meaningless vague question). MY2022 means the hummer will probably come out end of 2021."
33430,"Who cares. They strap a motor to a shell and call it “drivable”. Whoopdee fuckin do. Its still a concept and not production. Most of the “concepts” companies show off arent drivable vehicles. Theyre shapes with just enough parts to get to and sit on a display stand. Thats the way the industry works. 

Who cares if the commercial was cgi either. News flash, most are. The fact remains, gm has a much better capacity to deliver on their products and promises than tesla."
33431,"Disagree. A drivable concept car is a big step towards production over a CGI demo.

GM doesn't have better capacity to deliver on battery production, electric drive train, or an effective charging network, which Tesla already has in place."
33432,"Battery plant under contraction in Ohio, similar to gigafactory. Huge build outs in charging network also underway (2700 more with Evgo) plus electrify America is building a similar amount. It all looks like it will come online surprisingly quickly for GM. They may make some dumpy interiors but they seem very good at scaling up production."
33433,"Which gigafactory? Tesla has new factories going up in Berlin and Texas. 

Supercharger network at 20,000 units across 2000 stations, and since Tesla can also use EVGO, I don't think that's an advantage to GM."
33434,The Nevada battery plant. I didn’t say their charging network would be an advantage just pointing out that other oems are starting to build up charging networks at a pretty good clip too.
33436,"Its ridiculous to watch some times.

*Tesla delays release of Cybertruck*

/r/cars ""Tesla is a failure! Typical! What a shitty company that can't do anything right!""

*GM delays release of Hummer EV*

/r/cars ""well these things happen sometimes. I'm sure they're just refining the vehicle further. This truck is going to put Tesla out of business!"""
33437,Yea the anti-tesla circle jerk is actually the more annoying circle jerk of the 2
33438,No. Tesla bad.
33439,"I agree. The CGI demo is just as good as a concept car when it comes to production.

And Tesla doesn't have any real advantages. GM could easily starting making batteries, EV drive trains, and an effective charging network at any time."
33440,"GM had the Volt/Bolt so they have some experience. I really don't think they are that far behind.     

For years people have been debating that it was only a matter of time before the big dogs shifted towards electric and it is game over for Tesla. I feel that we are about to get to that point in 2021/2022."
33441,Once Windows phone comes out it's game over for the iphone
33442,Maybe under Satya it could have been
33443,Such a perfect analogy.
33445,"Yes, Tesla is currently delivering more electric cars since mostly all major manufacturers have not shifted towards electric cars.    

GM and basically all others are heading that way. They may be playing catch up as they don't have much of a line up at the moment but it will not take long for them to get there. They too have massive pockets, a massive fanbase and a supply network beyond Teslas current capabilities.    

GM sells close to 3 millions cars a year, Tesla is having supply problems with ~400k a year. If GM or others shift their factories to electric cars they'll be able to deliver and not just promise.   

They are top dogs but they are also old dogs so we will have to wait a few years and see if they can pull it off. I'm pretty sure they will though. Not sure where that'll leave Tesla. I have a feeling they will shift towards a more luxurious brand and leave the $30-40k market for GM and others. I doubt they'll be able to compete on the lower end."
33446,"You know that’s how *concepts* work, right?"
33447,You realize this article isn’t talking about concept vehicles right?
33450,/u/05f48 and /u/MainMaineMainer - please stop bickering. You are better than this.
33451,To not read the article is one thing but you apparently didn’t even read the headline. These are supposed to be coming to production next year.
33452,"Supposed to. That is my point. Supposed. Rivian was supposed to come out this year. Almost all of these were supposed to come out this year, or even before. But, semantics, I guess"
33453,That’s what you call a delay. If a vehicle gets delayed it will no longer come out at its designated time. This isn’t semantics. It’s just making a pointless argument.
33454,"Interested in the ID.4. Def leaning towards one of the smaller EVs (Kona, ID.4, Bolt) as my next daily. Would like to see the Soul EV Gen 2 come to the USA. 

Gonna be a while for me. My current house doesn't have an ideal parking situation or electrical system to handle a level 2 charger without major upgrades."
33455,Any estimates on the price for the lordstown truck? I keep forgetting it may exist.
33456,"$52,500....literally in the first couple of paragraphs of the article.

""While Lordstown’s Endurance should be out by September of 2021, the Endurance will initially be just for fleets. It will come in at a price of $52,500 (see below for more detail)."""
33457,That's what I get for skimming through the section headers only. Thx.
33458,Cheap. From what I know it's geared towards fleet vehicles.
33459,"""Lordstown"" sounds like the name of a bar you'd get in a fight in."
33460,"I'm pretty excited for the Rivian R1T/S and hope it does well. Not that I'll be able to afford one or have space anytime soon, but I saw it at an auto show and it looked very utilitarian and has a long range. Plus I could use it to tow my go-fast ICE cars"
33461,"Rivian is the exact opposite of utilitarian.  It is designed and marketed for the light truck market. It has a short bed, low load capability, and is marketed toward outdoor sports enthusiasts."
33462,It's anything but a truck. Can't tow any appreciable weight any reasonable distance. Short bed.
33463,Yup we might as well call it an open hatch SUV.
33464,I thought it could tow like 11k lbs? More than enough to tow a small sports car to the track
33465,"No, electric cars are highly susceptible to load and drag."
33466,This reads like AstroTurfing...
33467,Nobody on Reddit is allowed to be excited about anything anymore otherwise they're a shill.
33468,Leccy Range Rover Sport
33469,"Who in the hell would buy a $110k truck from a manufacturer that has zero knowledge/experience?

These are all nothing by HALO cars, but at the end of the day, they are too expensive to make any kind of market impact.

The Tesla approaches a reasonable price, but it's not going to be available until late 2022."
33470,"and GM is so stuck in the 20th century, they'll probably have vestigial exhaust pipe cutout in the back."
33471,Are they less than 60 grand base price? If not I don’t care
33472,I have 3 dollars
33473,"these people talking 60k 

ok mr money bags

best I can do is 5k"
33474,Best I can do is a used car battery and a Radio Flyer
33475,"Short answer: yes
Slightly longer answer: you won’t be buying anyway so why be negative about it"
33477,"You can get a decently optioned Jaguar I-pace for less than 60k after dealership discount and tax rebate.

A Model 3 *Performance* costs less than $60k, and so do the rest of the Model 3 line ups.

I think there are more EVs for less than 60k than there are ones that’s more expensive, in the States that is at least.

Edit: lol getting downvoted for listing straight up facts. The anti-EV crowd around here are experts at moving goalposts. It’s ok to just say you don’t like something for whatever personal reasons, I get it, especially as an enthusiast who went out of my way to get an ICE weekend car. But there is no need to make up excuses and then move goalposts over and over again."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/cars) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
33480,Half of the list is sub 50k base price. You won't be buying one anyways. You'll find a different excuse like the rest of r/cars lol
33482,"If that logic holds you can literally use deduction and say if you can’t afford a $50k car, you can’t afford a $40k car, and if you can’t afford a $40k car, you can’t afford a $30k car, and so on... and your purchasing power will be exactly zero.

So most people definitely have a line somewhere, if your line wasn’t $60k I don’t know why you mentioned that price point in your original comment, you should have just mentioned whatever your affordability threshold was, whether it’s $10k or $30k, and it’s perfectly fine because obviously a lot of people can’t afford $30k+ cars, or any new cars.

So yeah, the reality is that a lot of people who wouldn’t spend $$60k on a car would actually be ok with $50k, and the sale figures support that. The demand curve is a *curve*, not a step function."
33483,Then why did you use 60k as a cutoff?
33484,">Are they less than 60 grand base price? If not I don’t care

you asked under 60k, which 50k is less than 60k. Not only that but a few are under 40k lol."
33485,"If you can't afford $50K, then crying ""I want under $60K"" is silly. Rather than moving the goalposts, say the price you'll ACTUALLY consider buying at or stop BSing everyone."
33486,"""$5000 with a 20 year warranty"" -op probably"
33487,"It's ok, most people can't afford any new car anyway."
33488,Cyber truck will range from 70k to eventually 40k Sans full self driving.  That’s the one I’m keeping an eye on.
33489,"""eventually"" is really the key word here lol"
33490,Lordstown might be
33491,No Aptera.  Damn it.
33492,That was one hideous vehicle.
33493,Lol yeah like Lucid is anything but vaporware
33494,Must get me Rivian stock..... they are going to kill it. And they have Ford on board
33495,So much money for all of them. Why can’t someone make an electric Miata?
