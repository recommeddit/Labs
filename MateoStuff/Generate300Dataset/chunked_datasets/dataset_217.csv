71544,The Sixth Sense surprised the heck out of me.
71545,"The Empire Strikes Back

Vader: Search your feelings, you know it to be true

Luke: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO!"
71546,"I mean, how good a twist is it when even the actors themselves were shocked by it in the theater?  Usual Suspects is the only other one I can think of that pulled that sort of thing off."
71547,">  when even the actors themselves were shocked by it in the theater?

What do you mean?"
71548,"When Mark Hamill and David Prowse were on set, the line was ""Obi-Wan killed your father"".  Since it was dubbed over in post by James Earl Jones, Lucas was able to keep the real dialog very secret.  Something like only 6 people knew it beforehand.  So when Hamill and Prowse saw it in theater for the first time, they were as surprised as anybody.

In The Usual Suspects, the director had convinced Gabriel Byrne that his character was Kaiser Soze.  SO it came as quite a surprise to him when the movie comes out and it's Kevin Spacey instead."
71549,"> So when Hamill and Prowse saw it in theater for the first time, they were as surprised as anybody.

Incorrect, actually.  Prowse didn't know; he spoke the ""Obi-Wan killed your father"" line. There's an interesting thing about this situation though, because Prowse claimed that Vader was Luke's father well before ESB was even being filmed. But that was likely just a joke that was coincidentally true.  He claims to have not known about the twist, and was actually pretty angry about it.

Either way, Hamill was pulled aside about 5 minutes before shooting began and told the actual line and to act/react with that line in mind, not the ""Obi-Wan killed your father"" line.  And at that point only he, Lucas, and Kershner knew.

Then of course James Earl Jones has to record Vader's dialogue, at which point he knew.

So at the premiere Hamill and Jones knew, Lucas knew, Kershner knew, and it's possible one or two other people might have known due to editing the film and such.  But yeah, Hamill was in on it the whole time.

71550,"Oh.  Ok, thanks for the correction.

Actually, that makes sense.  Luke later has the force-conversation with Vader ""Father.""  ""Son.""  ""Ben, why didn't you tell me?"", which wouldn't be possible if he didn't know."
71551,"I mean, isn't that original line... Also kinda true?"
71552,From a certain point of view.
71553,"Worst part about these threads is that a lot of these movies sound really interesting, but now that you know the twist, there is no point in watching them."
71554,"""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he never exist"""
71555,Identity with John Cusack and Amanda Peet.
71556,*Whores don't get a second chance*
71557,"Arrival.

Not gonna spoil it, but the twist is awesome"
71558,"[Was I supposed to get it after she says to her kid to talk to her dad because he knows science?](/spoiler)

Because that's when I figured it out.  So the final reveal to me was like ""oh that makes sense"" more than ""woah I didn't see that coming"""
71559,"** SPOILER ALERT**
(Although get out of this thread if your worried about spoilers)

I guessed this twist for the same reason I guessed the sixth sense twist.
A seemingly unrelated scene at the start of the film that leaves you thinking ""what was the point in that?"""
71560,This. It may be because I just watched it but it was the time I was most surprised by a movie ever. It's just so unexpected and it punches you in the gut.
71561,Especially the departure.
71562,You need to park in the White Zone for that.  The Red Zone is for loading and unloading only.
71563,The White Zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. There is no stopping in the Red Zone.
71565,That movie took a complete 180 halfway through. I was so confused.
71566,Because that's the point when Tarantino stops directing and Rodriguez starts.
71567,Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Today its really cliche and its parodied all the time but when it came out it blew everyones mind.
71568,"Agreed. Now it's common knowledge, especially with the prequels out, but originally it was amazing."
71569,A couple of Denzel Washington movies with a nice twist: Training Day and Inside Man.
71570,Also Fallen
71571,Snowpiercer  has a nice little bit near at the end.  Makes you feel betrayed by the whole movie. 🙃
71572,"my asshole friend told me, as a spoiler, that Coca Cola takes over the world...the whole time until the last minute I kept looking for a bottle (or can) to show up, not the brand mascot. he also told me the blonde is a ghost in 6 sense, thought the kid was dead until the end"
71573,"The Girl On the Train
Mr. Nobody"
71574,The Girl on the Train was fantastic. I literally assumed every single character was bad except the actual bad character lol.
71575,"Murder on the Orient Express

Kind of a movie because I watched the TV movie before I read the novel but I'm one of those guys that has to solve cases and problems so whilst I was watching, I was partly deducing who the murderer was and whatnot. Wrote down some facts and narrowed it down to two people collaborating. Figured I was some genius. When Poirot explained what happened at the end, I was shook because I thought I had it all figured out. Still an amazing read after all this years as the more I read, the more I pick up small clues and facts between the lines. 

P.S. A new movie about this novel is coming out to the big screen soon and it stars like Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and Dame Judi Dench. Much excite."
71576,"Not a movie but ""Play Test"" episode in Black Mirror had a few plot twists. They blew my mind."
71577,"As someone who binged watched the series for the first time on Netflix yesterday (yes I was awake all night and most of the next day, barely left the couch) I can attest how each episode pretty much left me guessing. 

Not to give any spoilers to anyone but geez the time factor in the episode you mentioned is what had me fucked up the most. Also White Bear, and Shut up and Dance. Wow! I kinda wish I could go back and watch it all over again not knowing anything."
71578,"Jurassic World.

The setting is a reboot of the masterpiece Jurassic Park, then all of a sudden it's complete shit."
71579,"I like Jurassic World because it's a meta movie about itself. The super cool new Indominus Rex (Jurassic World and the other sequels) is a poorly conceived marketing creation, an amalgamation of what everyone thinks people will like, that in reality pales in comparison and eventually loses to the original T-Rex (Jurassic Park).

If you look at it that way and look at it as a pure popcorn, fun movie it is, that completely lacks the depth and smarts of the original, it works way better."
71580,"Jurassic Park was amazing. People hated the sequel. People hated the third one. Then the fourth one comes out and for some reason people are surprised they didn't like it. It's like the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over expecting different results. You go to an island, dinosaurs want to kill you. That's the plot for every movie. And honestly I love the movies, I like that plot, but stop going in to those movies expecting something original or something that makes sense."
71582,In Twister they were tornadoes the whole time.
71583,"Sorry, read that as tomatoes...."
71584,"I have to say Unbreakable, an underrated M. Night Shyamalan movie. What makes the plot twist so great is that once you see it, you realize that the entire movie was just hinting at it all along. It was already a good movie to begin with, but suddenly everything seems so obvious and just makes sense."
71585,Life of Pi
71586,He's a cold blooded murderer looking for revenge!!!
71587,"That ending bummed me out, I felt like I was just lied to for 90 minutes."
71588,Frailty.....shout out to Bill Paxton 😥
71590,"Dream house. 
Dude and his family move into a house. 
Weird shit happens and they find out the last family who lived there was allegedly murdered by their dad who is now in a psych ward place. 
The dad of the new family thinks the previous family's murderdad is stalking them and he goes to the psych place and finds out the murderdad has been released. 
He flips the hell out and goes to the police only to find that HE is the murderdad and he had a psychotic break after allegedly killing his family and made up a new persona for himself. 
He goes back to the house and realizes the family he's been living with are ghosts basically and the wifeghost keeps denying it because she can't handle it. 

Then they find out he didn't murder them, their neighbors ex husband hired a hit man to murder his ex wife so he could have their daughter. The hit man went to the wrong house. 


Crazy ass movie."
71591,Titanic. Who'da thought a bit of ice could have sunk a ship...
71592,Icebergs can't crack steel ships
71593,Titanic was a inside job.
71594,BUSH DID 4/15
71595,Law Abiding Citizen
71596,"**Spoilers ahead**

""The Visit"" by M. Night Shyamalan looked like your typical ""grandma is possessed by a demon."" But at the end it's revealed that the grandparents aren't possessed, they're just insane asylum escapees, that killed the actual grandparents."
71597,The Departed.
71598,The ending of Godfather pt. 2. When you know Michael's character development is complete
71599,"In The Hateful Eight, when Sam Jackson got shot in the dick"
71600,The usual suspects. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
71601,The fact that Vader/Anakin was the chosen one all along. He killed off the emperor and brought balance to the force. Luke just brought him to his senses at the last second.
71602,"Dear Zachary.

Just watch the movie and you'll see."
71603,"""No... **I** am your father."""
71604,I knew nothing about the plot of The Matrix so the red pill wake-up scene really threw me.
71605,The man from earth.
71606,"That shit in The Ring, ""you weren't supposed to *help* her""..."
71607,"Interstellar's Matt Damon was such a huge twist for me. I mean, never have I known that he'll be in the movie."
71608,I feel like that is going to ruin the point of a twist ending if you know there is a twist coming.
71609,"It probably depends on the person. 
I can watch a movie even though I know it has a twist ending but still enjoy it, because I don't think about the fact it will end in an unexpected way."
71611,"Yes. Also, Incendies."
71612,"Primal Fear, Soylent Green, The Crying Game."
71613,Primal Fear... so amazing
71614,I saw Crying Game before there was any buzz about the twist. Thought I was seeing an IRA movie.
71615,"Yeah, incredible screenplay."
71616,"Og you are just watching ""for the ending"" I'd say ""The mist"", definitely."
71617,"Not to be confused with The Fog. Both have interesting endings, but one won't make you want to get the time you spent watching garbage on a screen back."
71618,"Identity,  Sixth Sense, Fight Club, The Others, The Village, Secret Window, Lucky Number Slevin, High Tension(Crazy flick if you can handle all the gore) Derailed, The General's Daughter, Rosemary's Baby, Stalag 17(older movie, but still awesome) and Revolver all have wild endings"
71619,The Cabin in the Woods.  I shall say no more.
71620,Magnolia. Probably the most unexpected ending in recent film.
71621,the orphange (2007) Del Toro presents the movie you wont be let down.
71622,Pandorum.
71623,"If we tell you there's a surprising ending, **it won't be surprising**."
71624,"* *[Frailty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264616/reference)*. Yes, Matthew McConaughey is in it, and he's fantastic.

* *[Jacob's Ladder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/reference)*."
71625,Came here to say Frailty.
71626,"Primer has a bit of a twist in it, aside from the timeline. I think it's pretty good. And outside of the internet, no one really knows about it. 

This might be more mainstream than you're looking for, but Unbreakable has a pretty good twist in in. I often cite it as M. Night Shyamalan's greatest film, better than The Sixth Sense. Probably because I like superheroes."
71627,"Skeleton key , good lord"
71628,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, beautiful cinematography and an ending you'll never see coming."
71629,"Jagged Edge
Witness for the Prosecution

71630,I really enjoyed Basic with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.  Its well done imo.
71631,Clue.  Times three!
71632,"the others, the departed, old boy (korean), welcome to the JLA (korean)
the departed (and it's original infernal affairs) and welcome to the JLA are kind of twisty thrillers so it isn't as much a twist ending as the movie catching you off guard every 10 minutes.
 
I liked the endings of Saw 1 and 2 as well. 

Also haven't seen the original twist ending movie mentioned here but if you haven't seen it this the original american twist ending movie: The usual suspects"
71633,[Siesta!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093969/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl)
71634,Having people tell you these movies have great twists kinda ruins their twist.
71636,Brazil
71637,Arlington Road had a pretty big twist at the end and I liked it a lot.
71638,"The Departed, The Game, Moon, Duplicity and K-Pax"
71639,"I just watched Layer Cake for the first time and was pretty shocked by the ending.  I wouldn't call it mind-blowing, but I definitely didn't see it coming (although I should have)."
71640,"The Pact is on Netflix, that has a twisty surprise ending.

I also second The Orphanage, and add Orphan to the list as well."
71641,The Divide.
71642,The Escapist
71643,"If you're into foreign films, *La Haine* has a pretty jolting ending. Not a twist per se, but unexpected."
71644,Following (1998)
71645,"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Chinatown, Citizen Kane (provided you haven't heard it), A Star is Born (1954), Dead Man Walking, and The Deer Hunter."
71646,"Here's one that never shows up in any movie list on reddit. Jacky Chan's *little big soldier*. It's one of his Chinese movies, he does fight but it's not really a fighting kind of movie and I actually happen to think it's one of his better ones.

And I did not see the ending coming. At all."
71647,"Soylent Green, Amazing one"
71648,"All of the films already mentioned, plus repo men"
71649,Pathology had a great surprise ending.
71650,"Matchstick Men, American Psycho, Fight Club, Psycho, Se7en"
71651,"Uhm. Have you seen Insidious?
I found it quite good and the ending was a little way twisted."
71652,"Oh man, those jump scares.. and the boy in the corner.

But still, best part was the [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6oexzugnqI)."
71653,"Man, I hate that beyaaatch :<"
71654,They’ll be predictable now.
71655,"The Prestige. I’m sure it’s been said already, but I just watched it expecting a twist, but there’s legitimately a *twist* to the twist."
71656,Hell yes. And it’s spelled out so many times throughout the film. One of my favorite films ever.
71657,I need to see this. It's the only one of Nolan's I haven't seen.
71658,It's an incredibly Nolan-y film in just about every way so if you're generally a Nolan fan then you'll enjoy it quite a bit.
71659,Cabin in the woods
71660,I wish that eagle scene was cut from the beginning/middle. I think it would of been more fun of a reveal if we didn’t already see why they couldn’t leave.
71661,"Hmm, never thought about that. +1"
71662,"I'd also be interested in a cut of the movie where you see all the cabin crew scenes in order till the GodHand, then cut back to the beginning of the office crew scenes."

71665,"The Prestige is so brilliant because it actually tells you the twist but you don't see it coming because you aren't really looking, just like a magic trick.

It's really masterfully done."
71666,"The best part is that they don't just tell you, they tell you and tell you and tell you and show you and give you everything you need to know it and you still never get it til the end. Then when you watch it again, and every time you watch it, it's an even better experience picking up on new and subtle ways they revealed the secret the entire time."
71667,Definitely. Which is why it is far and away my favorite Nolan film. No disrespect to Dark Knight or Momento but they just aren't on that same level.
71668,The usual suspects is the grandfather of modern movies with a twist. So goddamn good.

71674,Se7en though. Completely unpredicable imo
71675,"How so? I love Se7en but wouldn’t call it unpredictable? 
If you refer to the very last scene involving a certain item on the ground, then maybe it’s a bit of a surprise. But it doesn’t “twist” the plot? There are plenty of great surprises, though!"
71676,That's not the twist. The twist is at the police station prior to that.
71677,Yep Spacey isn't even credited for the movie! That's an amazing twist imo

71697,"Snatch is my favorite, prolly somewhat better than Lock Stock"

71738,you just convinced me -- about to watch it :)
71739,I really didn’t see the end of Psycho coming
71740,"It is actually one of the earliest big examples of a plot twist. Before Psycho, people would buy a ticket to the movies and walk in and out however they liked. Hitchcock didn't want to spoil it, though, so he made it so that you could only watch Psycho from the beginning. It is default today but it was a big thing then.

Also, they didn't want people to walk in at the second half and wonder >!where the lead actress is!<."
71741,"I wish I'd seen it before seeing so many references about it then reading to find out why. It's been a part of the ""pop culture"" for so long I doubt many people don't know what happens even without watching it"

71744,Aaaahh yes. It's been a while since I've seen it and Norman being his mom is so in our culture I forgot it was a twist.

71792,"well if we recommend you one you'll probably be expecting an ""insane plot twist"" right?"
71793,Triangle - super clever mind-fuck of a horror movie with some great twists and turns along the way. Not a single one of which I saw coming.
71794,"Lock, Stock and Two Smocking Barrels"
71795,Shawshank Redemption... still has one of the best endings to a movie I’ve ever seen.

71799,"Split, if you otherwise live under a rock."
71800,The best offer
71801,"I love these.

Nothing like a film that you have to look up afterwards to work out what you just watched.

My recs:

Upstream Colour,
Primer and
Synecdoche, New York"
71803,"Seven 
Cache 
Fight Club"
71804,Searching
71805,believe it or not **Bee Movie**
71806,whats the point of knowing already that the movie has a twist
71807,I wouldn't say it had an insane plot twist but I thought it was entertaining. Guess you didn't think so?
71808,The guilty (2018)
71809,The signal
71810,[Next](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435705/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_47)
71811,Dead Again.
71812,"Honestly, Spider Man Hoemcoming’s plot twist got me pretty good. 

Lol @ everyone downvoting me cuz I mentioned a superhero movie."
71813,nah man i love superhero movies there just wasn't any insane plot twist
71814,The moment where he shows up to pick his date up for Homecoming was pretty surprising.
71815,Ya. I mean I don’t see how that-in any away-was predictable lol.
71816,Black Butterfly (Netflix)
71817,"Mother! 
Bird Box
Talented Mr. Ripley"
71818,Just watched Bird Box what part did you not see coming?  Reminded me a lot of The Happening?  Did I miss something in the movie?
71819,I’m so fucking gay
71820,The Departed.  Never seen a movie committed to the end of their primary characters the way that one was.
71821,I was like .. shit..Shit!!! SHIT!!!!
71822,My favorite movie of all time
71823,I don't give a fuck about Dignam!
71824,You should check out the Chinese original. The first one was remade as The Departed and there are two sequels.
71825,Oh fuck I totally forgot about that one! Great movie. Been on a Korean movie binge lately I guess it's time to get some Chinese in there. And holy crap it's on Netflix.
71827,"Yeah this was magnificently crafted.

The only thing that bugs me is the actions of Natalie soon after our amnesiac friend comes to her bar. I cannot rationalise anyone reacting to the situation that way, and it has made the film hard to watch again."
71828,"I don't remember the exact timeline, but from what I recall he showed up to the bar wearing her boyfriend's clothes and driving his car, which would understandably freak her out. It was the first time she had met him, but her boyfriend had talked about him before, so she knew about his condition and tested him on it."
71829,Lucky Number Slevin.
71830,"The Kansas City Shuffle! 

I love it when a movie straight up hands you the old “watch closely. I’m going to trick you” and then it does and you feel good about it."
71831,"As you look left, they fall right,
Into the Kansas City Shuffle! ;)"
71832,I'm surprised this was mentioned so late. It's one of the few movies I've gone in without knowing the plot and just been completely blown away. One of my favorites.
71833,This movie is fantastic
71834,Shutter Island surprised me the most
71835,"I always tell people who have never seen this movie that they need to watch it twice. Finish it the first time, and then immediately start it over and watch again. 

**[spoilers below, if you haven't seen it, and don't want me to ruin it, quit reading]**

The acting in this movie is incredible. It's a bunch of people who are good at acting playing nurses and doctors, who, by the fact that they are nurses and doctors, and don't know much about acting, are absolute shit at acting. Watch the movie a second time and it's so apparent, but you probably would have never noticed the first time, or, if you're more observant, maybe you did, and thought they were acting poorly. Perfect examples: When Leo and his partner are asked to turn in their guns, Leo takes the holster of his belt in one fluid motion. His partner has a ton of trouble removing it. Also, in the same scene, the police captain, who was played by one of the main doctors at the facility, basically coddles them when asking for their guns. He speaks down to them like a parent would a child. It's obvious he is not an officer, but actually a doctor with too many years of experience, and very little patience, dealing with mentally ill.

The movie is incredible."
71837,"My friend figured it out from the trailer like a month or two before the movie came out. Once he said it, it just made so much sense in my head that I was never able to watch the movie."
71838,Or he found the book and messed with you about figuring out the ending from just the trailer.
71839,"The book was really good, as is most of Dennis Lehane's work."
71841,I still get goosebumps when I hear Aaron start to clap at the end.
71842,"""Good  . . . for . .  you, Marty!"" So very snide."
71843,"It’s the one big masterfully done end twists I remember ever seeing when I was still a kid. Not a single thing warns you before that moment. I remember watching it with my mother one night. I was a bit older and I was beginning my journey with well done “serious” movies, and my mum has always been a fan of stories involving murders and trials so we were just having a good time with an engaging and well directed (and acted) movie. I remember my mother saying “holy shit” out loud when Edward Norton started clapping and having my whole body covered in goosebumps. It was amazing."
71844,"This was Edward Norton’s breakout role, and deservedly so."
71845,"The Empire Strikes Back. 

In 1980, NOBODY saw that coming. 

It was such a massive shock that it’s pretty much impossible for anyone who grew up in the prequel/sequel era to appreciate it."
71846,"I was 11 and watched Empire in a packed theatre with my dad. There was a collective gasp and then the place erupted as everyone suddenly HAD to talk to the person next to them. 

It. Was. Awesome!"
71847,Movie theatres coming alive because the film is just THAT good is one of the greatest experiences.
71848,"Was about about 7-8 years old when my mom took me to see A New Hope in my small hometown. She didn't know it was a double header for ANH and ESB...

Imagine a theater FULL of 7-12 yo kids, watching Star Wars in the early 80's. We shouted at the scream, we went crazy when Luke and Leia kissed before crossing the bridge, gasped when Obi Wan died...and went crazy at the reveal.

BEST MOM-SON afternoon EVER! For me at least."
71850,‘Vader literally means father’ -pitch perfect
71851,I speak a very close derivative of Dutch and never realized this. I feel pretty stupid now. Hahahaha (Afrikaans)
71852,"Although iirc that was pure coincide. The sith lord names are based of traits shown by the sith lord themself, with Vader for invader, Sidious for insidious, Plagueis for Plague, and so on. It meaning father in Dutch was not planned."
71853,"I knew that going in, but I assumed it was a metaphorical reference to the priesthood, referring to “the force” users as a kind of religion."
71854,Righttt. Like fuck  I mean God is often called the father but he didn't fuck my mom.
71855,Don’t be so sure... *Jesus*!
71856,"They might've guessed it completely coincidentally but no, Vader wasn't originally going to be Lukes father, it's just a neat coincidence"
71857,"If I remember correctly, George Lucas himself said he didn't decide to make Darth Vader Luke's father until writing the second movie."
71858,"Hence Obi-Wan's ""from a certain point of view"" nonsense."
71859,"I don't see how that implies it directly. ""Dark Father"" was just a coincidence I think. 'Vader' was just a word used on it's own."
71860,"I was impressed by Prisoners. The movie does a good job of setting up severel red herrings as to who kidnapper is, but each leaves important clues that tie together to hint at the actual kidnapper. That plus Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhal as the two protagonists each with differing oppinions and approaches to how to find the truth, you find yourself picking sides over which one of them to root for."
71861,This movie was so stressful to watch.
71862,Two hours of non-stop bated breath and clammy palms. I absolutely love it but holy hell is it mercilessly intense.
71864,"""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist""

God damn that is such a great movie"
71865,"And like that, poof, he’s gay."
71866,"Whoa dude, I know he's a bad guy, but I don't know about calling him a poof."
71867,"I'm so glad somebody posted this and its so upvoted. I've had people give me shit for saying this, that they knew who Soze was the whole time etc etc etc.  I was so captivated by that movie my jaw was damn near literally on the floor at the end of that movie.

To anyone who has never seen it, don't read a single thing about it before watching it and put your fucking phone down while its on. It's an experience."
71868,"This has been on my watchlist for years. I know nothing about it, I will make a point of watching it this week."
71869,"The first time I watched this movie, the twist had already been spoiled for me, I knew who Soze was the whole time, and somehow I still managed to get completely enthralled, and the twist STILL surprised the shit out of me! What a great movie"
71870,Saw got me good
71871,"The first movie was brilliant. I can remember having a go about how obvious the ending was going to be and then, when that thing happens at the end, I pretty much just shut my damn mouth for a couple of months."
