42994,"Halt and Catch Fire. 

It's basically Mad Men: 80's Computer Company Edition. Soooooooo good,  slow burn with an amazing cast."
42995,Now *this* caught my attention :O will check it out!!
42996,"Lots of mentions on Broadchurch, with David Tennant, and I agree.

A little known David Tennant TV series (3 episodes) is [The Escape Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escape_Artist_(TV_series)). $7.99 on Amazon Prime, well worth it. I've seen most of what everyone here has suggested, and above all I most often think about the Escape Artist."
42997,"True Detective (HBO) is great series. Season 1 and 3 are great. Watch season 2 if you are interested for more. Each season is its own story.

Also The Killing was a good series. I watched it on Netflix but it may be on other streaming services. It’s been awhile since I finished it."
42998,Also if u have Amazon prime. Watch Patriot.
42999,"1983 (polish series) a very underrated but highly rated series. A great political thriller with nice acting and stunning cinematography. Idk, why no one doesn't talk about this series.  Worth watching."
43000,"I'm surprised you listed Better Call Saul but not Breaking Bad... did you not like it, or have you not seen it? If you haven't seen it, then... BREAKING BAD! 

Only 4 seasons, but Mr. Robot is fucking fantastic (not on Netflix unfortunately, but I really recommend trying to watch it). Hannibal is also great, but there are only 3 seasons. 

Bates Motel is so good and creepy, but it might be a bit campy for you. 

If you want an endless supply of true crime, Forensic Files is the way to go. Like a million episodes, but they're very formulaic."
43001,"I've seen it twice all the way through--it was fantastic, but something about it always left me feeling very distant, it's incredible well shot but I never got as involved in it as other shows of its caliber, I can't really put my finger on it. Season 4 got close, and the final episodes are simply iconic, but even then, it still felt like watching TV. I guess other than Walt, and occasionally Jessie, the characters fell a little flat for me. I particularly did not like how his wife's character was written and found her to be very out of place in some of its most crucial moments, almost contradictory or portrayed as dumb, but I can't say it's anything less than incredible!!"
43002,"Well, MindHunter obviously."
43003,"""Black Sun"" - available on Amazon Video is truly a hidden gem"
43004,"I really liked mindhunter. The second season was kind of meh but the first one was really good. Still, i wouldnt say the second one was horrible. Just wish it had more ""interviews"" with ""convicted killers"". (Put in quotes because i know theyre just actors. Still i think they did a good job)."
43005,"Mindhunter for sure

I'd give a big rec to Hannibal, it starts pretty slow but it's gotten really freaking good on the tail end of s1."
43006,"Wow, what a response!! Thank you all so much, truly. These are all wonderful, I can't wait to start some of these, (and then some more\~)"
43007,I just started watching “in the dark” I’m on episode 3 and it’s pretty good so far. But I really recommend Hannibal and obviously dexter.
43008,BLACKLIST
43009,Forensic files!
43010,Escape at Dannemora is fantastic and based on a real prison escape.
43011,True detective is really good and if you haven’t you need to see breaking bad. Hannibal is true crime ish as well
43012,So good to know!
43013,My SO won’t binge (🙄) but I’m sure we will go through it quickly. Started with the first two episodes of season 1 last night. When is Mikell.... kind feeling like a much more serious and interesting Stranger Things
43014,Defending Jacob on AppleTV
43015,Fargo season 1
43016,Dark does not deserve to be on spot with all other masterpiece you listed
43017,Occupied. 3 seasons. Politics and action and very realistic.
43018,"Hunters on Amazon Prime!!!!! Al
Pacino plays a badass nazi hunter with a ragtag group of vigilantes seeking revenge on the Holocaust. so fucking badass"
43019,"Here’s a crime move coming up

Cuties."
43021,"You listed almost all my favorite shows - couple more that I’ve liked over the years (and that have many seasons to binge on) would be Sons of Anarchy and Weeds. Also good but limited in no. of episodes - Bodyguard (the show on Netflix, not the Kevin Costner movie)."
43022,"Sons of Anarchy is so underrated. Very flawed, but so beautiful. Didn't realize it was adapted from Hamlet until I googled the end, but I really appreciated that component after the fact. Weeds is a show I grew up watching as it aired, and it has a special place in my heart!!"
43023,"Wow, guess we have the same taste in TV :D please lmk if any other shows come to mind that you like then! Could use some recs myself"
43024,Dirty John!!
43025,Broadchurch S01
43026,I really didn’t see the ending coming.
43027,I'm usually terrible at guessing - I even struggle with Scooby-Doo - but I somehow got this one pretty early
43028,Came to say this. Happy it was the top comment.
43029,100% this
43030,You might enjoy And Then There Were None.
43031,That was a great miniseries with an excellent cast.
43032,American Vandal season 1
43033,Season 2 as well. I personally liked it even more.
43034,Yeah I'd say S2 managed to surpass S1 at that. The last like 2 to 3 episodes were insanely thrilling
43035,Season 2 definitely had the best who dunit
43036,I thought [Harper's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Island) did a decent job of this.
43037,That was such an underrated show!
43038,Ah man... loved Harper's Island.
43039,I love that show! Lots of red herrings.
43040,Bron/Broen
43041,Make up your mind!
43042,"Actually the official title is Bron | Broen, depending on the season, Bron || Broen season 2.

Bridge in Danish, Swedish.

This show has been copied three times - US and Mexico, France and England and I think somewhere in Eastern Europe."
43043,whoosh!
43044,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1733785/
43045,whoosh
43046,"Twin Peaks was a national phenomenon primarily because of the murder mystery. I don't think any list of ""The Best Whodunits"" is complete without mentioning that one. I dunno how fair it is to expect the viewer to figure out the mystery though, it's pretty fucking wild when it's all said and done."
43047,"I came here to say the same thing, but also share the hesitation. I don't know how anyone could've figured out the mystery, but man, the journey to the answer sure is wonderful."
43048,Wonderful AND strange.
43049,Death in Paradise (on Netflix) has pretty fair mysteries that can be solved by viewers.
43050,"Death in Paradise is kind of genius because it’s so simple. 

One story each week, no real sub-plots or arcs, likeable characters, and some pretty famous guest stars (at least if you’re British)."
43051,DI Goodman dating was a bit of an arc.
43052,True. I meant more like there’s not big bad or conspiracy. There’s little bits each episode to flesh out the characters. But if you watch a single episode it makes as much sense as it would if you’ve seen every episode.
43053,"Yes, good for syndication.

Also, they probably have no big bads or anything like that because they have to spend half the time trying to explain the mystery."
43054,Also beautiful women
43055,"And beautiful scenery. I watch it spending most the time wishing I was out there, murder be damned!"
43056,Good for fans of locked room mysteries.
43057,And a lizard named Harry-even if he is CGI.
43058,I actually just watched one the day before I posted this thread and it was a locked room mystery.  Is that common in the show?
43059,Very common.
43060,"The Killing is really good for this, season 1-2 especially"
43061,Gonna chuck in another vote for The Killing. The first mystery dragged in parts as it did span two seasons (I think mystery dramas should be 8-12 episodes at most) but otherwise it was great.
43062,I was so mad with the ending of season 1 I never really got into season 2.  I gave the series another shot because my wife wanted to watch it and oh man was season 2 fantastic.  All of the seasons are a good mystery.
43063,"The Missing - seasons 1 and 2 and surely the upcoming show Baptiste.

Tabula Rasa

Top of the Lake


I could go on..."
43064,"I loved The Missing, and was wondering recently whether it was going to continue.  Baptiste is a great character (and ties the 2 seasons together), so I'm thrilled that they did a spinoff with him.  Anyone know if Starz is going to air it in the US, like they did with The Missing."
43065,Tabula Rasa is *amazing*.
43066,Who Shot Mr Burns?
43067,"Homer Simpson

Edit - Seems like a lot of people have never seen the episode to get the joke."
43068,"Murder She Wrote.

Ellery Queen.

Poirot.

Marple."
43069,"Murder, She Wrote is easy.  It's always Jessica Fletcher.  You just need to work out who she's framed for it"
43070,My great-uncle used to date Angela Lansbury before he passed years ago. Love the show!
43071,Sharp Objects did this quite well.
43072,">upcoming

Nah so obvious i though"
43073,"Veronica Mars S1 & S2. The reveal for S1 was just okay, but I was very invested all season."
43074,I thought it was magnificent.  I regard season 1 as being the single best American murder mystery ever made.
43075,The Missing. Season 1 was really good. Season 2 was phenomenal. Both seasons really had me guessing until the end.
43076,same... baptiste series soon.
43077,"*Baptiste* has already begun airing on the BBC; no news yet on a US network picking it up, though."
43078,"House is honestly one of the only shows in recent years that feels like a whodunnit

Masterpiece theaters Poirot and other Agatha Christie adaptations fit the bill"
43079,"I mean that's because House is a direct riff on Sherlock Holmes, just the mystery is medical instead of death.

House-Holmes

Wilson-Watson

I think there was a reference to 221b but it's been a while"
43080,House lives in 221B Baker Street. It's pretty on the nose with Holmes connections.
43081,Perhaps his office room number was probably 221B
43082,How a viewer gonna solve the mystery in an episode of House?
43084,That show should also get bonus points for representing court cases as taking place over the course of more than a day or two.
43085,i thought the mentalist was pretty good but you have to be pretty observational like jane was.  There was none of this detective reveals some random inspiration or detail impossible for the audience to know.  Everything relevant detail jane was observing was shown to the audience
43086,"Forbrydelsen (Danish The Killing) series 2 

Broadchurch series 1 

The Missing series 1 

Unforgotten deserves a mention too."
43087,not the Missing season 2? I thought that one was even better
43088,"Trapped (Iceland)

Zone Blanche (French-Belgian)"
43089,"With all the remakes and revivals, they should do a new *Ellery Queen*."
43090,With Timothy Hutton.
43091,"I like Midsomer Murders.  
At least until John Nettles left.  
  
Also as someone else has said, Poirot, preferably David Suchet, or Miss Marple adaptations."
43092,"I occasionally catch the more recent episodes, i think they are pretty good, definitely have the Midsomer Murders feel to them. But John Nettles' Barnaby was just the best."
43093,That head tilt and eye squint! haha
43094,Honestly Riverdale S1 was a pretty well told whodunnit. Of course everything after that is almost incomprehensible but I maintain the opinion that season 1 was legitimately good TV
43095,"Sharp Objects, Bodyguard, True Detective"
43096,"The first season of Dirk Gently meets most of your requirements, it might be difficult to guess who committed the crime the season is based around though given time travel is a part of the show."
43097,Sharp Objects was great! Nice difference was the protagonist wasn't a detective but a reporter. Fantastic show overall.
43098,"Seeing as how ABC had a show called Whodunnit, I'd go with that.  

r/whodunnit.  I really wish they'd kept this in production."
43099,"and there was a british game show of the same name.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunnit%3F_(UK_game_show)"
43100,User name checks out.
43101,"There was also a US game of the same name based on the UK show, and a US show of the same name that was unrelated."
43102,"I was gonna say that. Considering there were literally no clues at all that you could follow (Wikipedia says there were two hints you could've picked up on, and one contestant guessed the killer every episode) it was *impossible* to solve. It was a fun show to watch, though."
43103,"What were the two hints?

I was 90% certain I knew who the killer was upon the limbo dance sequence -- the killer needed to get access to Giles' phone.

I was right.  The only thing that made me doubt myself was perhaps the killer was using a stooge to get the access."
43104,"[A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283205/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39) is exactly what you're asking for. It stars a charming Tim Hutton and a cast that are mostly brand new characters from week to week. It's set in the late '40's (I think), so there's a bit of that film noir aspect and cool gargantuan cars. The stories do a nice job of taking you through the process of solving the case, with Hutton doing a lot of leg work to develop information as the show proceeds. IIRC, they never do the last-minute reveal like Agatha Christie often does."
43105,I really liked that show shame it didn't stay on longer.
43106,"Thanks, I'll have to look for it.  The last minute reveal is what I'm looking to avoid"
43107,"not really a ""who dun it"" but the reveal of the mole in season 1 of 24 was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat."
43108,"Unsure if it qualifies, but really enjoyed series 1 of The Tunnel."
43109,"There's a couple of episodes of Agents of Shield that come to mind. One episode where at least 1 of 4 superpowered ppl are infected with a mind control parasite after a mission and everyone seems shady. Another episode a number of agents are replaced with androids with perfect memories with intent on replacing other key ppl, this one gets dark when one character essentially murders her boyfriend when she figures out he's a robot."
43110,Elementary is an enjoyable modern day Sherlock Holmes series.
43111,"Jonathan Creek.

Usually, at the beginning of each episode, some kind of mysterious, ""impossible"" crime happens, and the title character uses his deductive powers and the skills he has learnt as a magic prop constructor to figure it out.

I watched a bunch of episodes several years back and I think I had a pretty good rate of solving it by the end... better than 50%, I'm pretty sure.

Like with trying to figure out a magic trick, I start by thinking, ""One of the things that *appeared* to happen didn't actually happen. What was it?"""
43112,"I'll keep going...

La Foret

Requiem

Happy Valley (this should really be at the top)

Bodyguard

The Fall (it's been a while, not sure if it qualifies)

Luther"
43113,Ellery Queen
43114,"I am sad that no one has mentioned Rubicon (2010).

That show was really thoughtful and put together a really interesting mystery webbed in secret organisations and paranoia."
43115,The season of Nip/Tuck with The Carver
43116,The Simpsons who shot mr burns episodes were awesome
43117,Murdoch Mysteries?
43118,American Vandals both season
43119,"* Endeavour
* Grantchester"
43120,Never heard of these.  Are they British?
43121,Murder She Wrote is imo the best pure Whodunit ever done.
43122,Rubicon
43123,The Mentalist.
43124,Who is Cartman's Dad?
43125,"I pretty much watch TD, Fargo, the sopranos and the wire on a loop. If you haven't watched the wire or the sopranos you should check them out."
43126,Fargo is criminally underrated.
43127,"Yea, Fargo has been great all 3 seasons.  I think it’s as good as TD."
43128,It’s been more consistent than TD. It hasn’t had an average season yet. All 3 are top-quality TV.
43129,“OMAR’S COMIN”
43130,"""Oh, indeed."""
43131,Take your silver.
43132,"Thank you, kind redditor!"
43133,My husband and I try to say it like Omar does and we fall flat.
43134,Sheeeeeeeeeit
43135,I couldn’t believe that when I first heard it
43136,"♪♪*whistling of ""Farmer in the Dell"" intensifies*♪♪"
43137,A man's gotta have a code...
43138,I just for some reason can not get into the wire. I’ve honestly tried like 4x
43139,"How far did you get? I really struggled to get through the first season. I gave up a couple times. Finally I powered through, and it sunk its teeth in. It’s just about the opposite of a “moments” show. It’s all in the subtle things that you just start to notice after a while. By the end it all ties together. It’s really beautiful...and infuriating realizing that apparently it’s still the same shit over a decade later."
43140,"Usually 6/7 episodes in, in season 1. Trust me I WANT to get into because what I hear from everyone how it’s one of the best shows hands down. One of these days I’ll just have to force myself too."
43141,"That’s basically what I had to do. The finale winds up being really satisfying. Then S2 is great, S3 was good, and S4 is where I really fell in love with the show."
43142,well I’m going to give myself another chance haha. I’ll admit the first time I tried to watch True Detective season 1 I got so confused 🤷‍♂️ but now I watch things with subtitles and it makes me paying attention a lot easier.
43143,"Good luck! Just get past Bird’s trial, and you should be good."
43144,"Sopranos blew my mind as a teenager. Got the first four seasons on DVD about 8 months before season 5 started. Me and my best friend got obsessed lol, talked about it all the time. Loved that shit. By the time I got to college, had passed that DVD set around to every muthafucka I knew. So that season 6A and 6B, we would all congregate somewhere and watch each episode. It was like an event, like getting to watch your team in the playoffs. Never had a TV experience quite like that since. 

But I will always love that show and watch it every couple of years. It’s therapeutic, actually. And gets funnier and deeper with each rewatch. You don’t wanna get me started on that final season or scene lol. Will always be my favorite show, sentimental value, but it’s just brilliant.

True Detective somehow became just like that over recent years. The other two are good TV but Season 1, the setting and McConoughay’s Rust Cohle, it’s on a different level. I just love that character and relate to him so much. Feel like I’ve learned so much from him, and I’m not talking about on any philosophical level. Because his philosophy, to me, is just a defense mechanism.

I know I’ve read somewhere that NP said Sopranos was a huge influence and showed him the true potential of television. I like to think that’s where the idea for the season first took shape. “I need something like the Dr Melfi sessions on Sopranos. A kind of Greek chorus that will allow us to get into the mind of the main character, but he is also lying through much of it, sonthe audiende has to make their own interpretation.... how about an interrogation/interview!” And it just took off from there.

OP, if you haven’t seen The Wire, that shit is incredible storytelling, on a different level. 

I’d put Sopranos, The Wire, and TD S1 on my top tier, with Breaking Bad slightly below"
43145,Sharp Objects
43146,This. Super good true dectective vibes. And a good show.
43147,Great ending too
43148,Came here to say the same. They did a great job with the tone of the show
43149,Mindhunter on Netflix.  Opening scene will grab you.
43150,I'm so excited for season 2 tomorrow.
43151,Whoop.. Didn't know this
43152,Isn’t that so satisfying when u get a new season of a show you like out of the blue
43153,Speak for yourself. I’ve been going crazy waiting for it
43154,"Same, it’s been so fucking long since season 1"
43155,"Going crazy eh? Sounds like the *Mindhunter* has become the... 

***Mindhunted***


^(This didn't make sense)"
43156,Me waiting for the Witcher series to come to Netflix.
43157,Oh yes! Ive been waiting it! great news
43158,"The Sinner, Broadchurch, The Killing (all on Netflix) are some of my favorite detective shows.

The Night Of (HBO miniseries) is also really good.

And I agree with others who said The Wire, Mindhunter, and Sherlock"
43159,"Broadchurch is one my favourite crime tv show, it’s just so consistent and well written, wish I could just forget it and watch it again"
43160,Totally agree. Season 1 was one of my favorites in television history
43161,"I watched season 1 in one sitting, it’s so good."
43162,season 2 was terrible.
43163,i think the built on the first season in a really clever way. also love the lee ashworth stuff
43164,"I heard that The Night Of pilot is amazing, possibly the best, but the rest of it falls flat and the writing isn’t the best. What’s your opinion?"
43165,"You heard wrong my friend.

Night Of is amazing in almost every way.

Highly recommend."
43166,It's just an American version of the superior 'Criminal Justice'.
43167,You are correct. It devolves into a slow moving and anti-climactic police procedural with creepy foot picking scenes as the only memorable event in the 2nd half of the season.
43168,"night of is awesome. meticulously paced and calculated, everything is something whether it pans out is something else but it is all important."
43169,Is the killing on Netflix? I know it used to be but I couldn’t find it last time I checked.
43170,"Ah, yeah it looks like The Killing isn't on Netflix anymore, my bad. It's on Hulu and Amazon Prime.

PSA -- here's a great site to find which streaming platforms a TV show or movie is currently on: https://www.justwatch.com/us"
43171,The night of is amazing!
43172,"Hannibal

The wire 

Sopranos

Mindhunter

Sherlock (with Benedict cumberbatch)"
43173,I was just thinking of Hannibal today. I still can’t believe that it’s real. Gods it was just so good.
43174,Is it Benedict Cumberbatch or Bumberstick Lumberstack?
43175,Beatyoass Cumstickrash
43176,Dark on Netflix has a similar feel imo
43177,Yes. This.
43178,"Absolutely this

Sick mundus bro"
43179,Twin Peaks - esp S3 of TP & S3 of TD
43180,"Yas, this!"
43181,"Check out ""American Crime Story."" Both seasons are now on Netflix. The first one is about the trial of O.J. Simpson, and the second focuses on the murder of Gianni Versace.

""Luther"" is great too."
43182,"Season 1 of American Crime Story was really good, season 2 is absolutely incredible. Like TD season 1, I couldn't stop telling people to watch it."
43183,">Season 1 of American Crime Story was really good, season 2 is absolutely incredible.

Agreed. Darren Criss was outstanding in S2."
43184,"Dark is great and definitely give you the time is a flat circle vibes. 

Fargo is also amazing, particularly season 1 but they're all good. 

As others have said Mindhunter as well. I also highly recommend The Terror even though it's not very similar, just a great thriller"
43185,The Terror is so underrated. The acting is phenomenal.
43186,Dark: From the same country that brought you nihilism.
43187,"Sharp Objects.

Has a VERY similar eerie/ southern gothic vibe."
43188,perfect time for mind hunter since s2 will be out tmmrw!
43189,The Killing on Netflix.
43190,"1. Dark - on Netflix. Great mystery/thriller show. Requires 110% of your attention. There is a lot going on and it's key that you follow who each character is. One of the best shows I've seen in the last few years

2. Assassination of Gianni Versace: America Crime  Story - the main character/villian is acted so well and has such a creepy vibe to him that's hard to explain. There's a reason why he won an Emmy for the role

3. Manhunt: Unabomber - on Netflix too. About the FBI agent hunting down the Unabomber. I thought it was a good 8 episode miniseries"
43191,"I’m obsessed with Dark, probably one of favourite shows of all time! Thanks for the suggestions"
43192,The most annoying part is I don't know anyone irl to talk about it with and I keep trying to get my friends to watch it but they haven't yet. And ugghhh there is just so much to talk about that show
43193,"If your friends don't Dark, well then they're no friends of mine."
43194,Exactly my problem too! It’s such a dissectible show but none of my friends are interested in it.
43195,SouthLAnd
43196,Justified. Tim Olyphant and Walton Goggins are a powerhouse. They also dug coal together.
43197,"Eastbound and Down. 

It's nothing like TD, but after a season, it's nice to laugh a bit just to cleanse the palate before watching TD again."
43198,Mindhunter and The Wire.
43199,SHARP OBJECTS
43200,Started watching S1 today. There goes my week.
43201,I stayed up till 5am watching it lol...I have problems
43202,I've watched S1 like at least 5 times.
43203,TD is one of those shows that puts me in a “mood” where I feel fully immersed. Another show that does that for me is Peaky Blinders
43204,The Fall (Gillian Anderson)
43205,Quarry
43206,"Not on par with it, but the visual style is very similar."
43207,Such an amazing show! So sad they never made season 2
43208,"I remember watching True Detective, Hannibal, and Fargo all during the same summer. It might be because I watched them so close together, but they almost felt like similar plots and themes told through different creative voices. 

I'd also second Mindhunter and Sharp Objects. They're the obvious choices, but there's still something to the confidence and freshness to Hannibal and Fargo that I think reminds me more of that first season of TD."
43209,Those are all amazing shows.
43210,"Yeah, people who really like true detective like good shows. Legit though, that’s why I love these threads"
43211,"Try ""River"" on Netflix."
43212,"#1 - Dark, Mr. Robot, Westworld. 
#2 - The expanse, counterpart"
43213,"so sad counterpart did not get a third season. i love the sci-fi aspect of the split world. plus the history teacher loves the whole allegory for cold war that was present. this needs to continue. also J.K. Simmons is AWESOME in the dual role!!!!! he, somehow, physically caries himself differently in each character. just amazing!!!"
43214,"Me too. I've been looking for one for the past three years.

For me the only thing I've come across that is kind of close to the feeling of despair is A Scanner Darkly"
43215,"Mr. Mercedes is scratching the itch for oddly weird crime drama, like True detective. i will admit i am only about halfway through season 1 but it is really good, in my opinion."
43216,"Where are you watching it? I've been dying to see it, but can't find it anywhere."
43217,"Lots of great suggestions here, am making notes to watch some. I'd also add the HBO series Carnivale, it's incredible. TD S1 is my favorite season of any show ever, and Carnivale is my favorite series. Sadly it was cut short after just 2 seasons even though the creator of the show had a 6 season arc planned out."
43218,"""...*how fucked up the main characters were (+ambiguous morality) and how dark and grim it was"".* You should watch the french series Braquo"
43219,"The Wire is my favourite show of all time. Recently, Dark on Netflix is also worth a watch. Edgy vibe like True Detective. Really recommend it"
43220,"I think you would like scandinavian shows, usually they are very dark and dense.

* Broen
* Mammon
* Forbrydelsen

There are couple others I would recommend:

* Wire in the Blood (old but gold)
* Utopia
* Top of the Lake
* Fortitude (only first season)"
43221,The first season of Top of The Lake is very good and similar to True Detective. That and Mind Hunter as well.
43222,"Mindhunter, The Jinx, Night Of, The Wire and Fargo."
43223,Luther starring Idris Elba. His character reminds me of Rust a bit. Luther and season 1 of True Detective are my favorite crime series’ ever. It’s on Amazon Prime btw.
43224,"""The Sinner"" (USA Network) Season 1 is pretty good for the said subject matter."
43225,Mindhunter on Netflix is good. Season 2 just came out.
43226,"Recently found 'Der Pass' on nowtv / sky atlantic and it's fantastic. the rest have been mentioned... both seasons of the sinner, mindhunter (2nd season out tomorrow), the killing, manhunt: unabomber, enjoy."
43227,Mr. Robot really fits the same tone as True Detective Season 1. The main character is a drug-addict and really nihilistic and condescending in the same vein as Rust.
43228,You should watch dark on Netflix. If you are interesting in your brain get multiple shocks. Highly recommended
43229,TOO YOUNG TO DIE OLD!!!!!!!! it’s a really slow burn but it is a good one.
43230,"The Leftovers,Sons of Anarchy, Six Feet Under, Bron/Broen, Bloodline, Black Sails, Deadwood, Mindhunter, Fargo. Great shows. The plot and the characters are great and well written. Highly recommended."
43231,"Six Feet Under 10/10 

Best series ending ever"
43232,"as far as shows there isnt many but id say def Fargo, Killing and Mindhunter.

The movie Prisoners is the closest thing to the TD vibe ive ever watched."
43233,If you like that check out [The Flock](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473356/)
43234,def will
43235,I hope you “enjoy??” It as much as I did
43236,"Check out Memories of Murder, Zodiac, The Wailing, Midsommar for some horror/procedural/cult/mystery vibes"
43237,"1. Luther 
2. Sherlock

Both of these series have a ton in common with TD.  Despite these listed being BBC with a bit different formatting as American TV, they all have common themes and moods. For instance, they all have amazing Detective Protagonists. Luther (Idris Elba) specifically shines because of how dark and convoluted crime-solving can be. His hands aren’t always clean, but he does what needs to be done in order to solve rather disturbing puzzles. It’s wild. Sherlock is a bit different considering it has some humor to it; however, it can get very dark as well. Both are suitable choices to scratch that TD itch. Trust me I’ve been there. Lol 

TL;DR: Luther and Sherlock are both very dark, unsettling detective dramas that center around protagonists who aren’t always on the straight and narrow but will always find a way to stop evil by putting themselves in harms way."
43238,"Somebody already mentioned Mindhunter, but Manhunter was also excellent."
43239,The Missing...seriously
43240,"Try Innocent (Masum), a Turkish show on Netflix."
43241,"Continuum was pretty good. 

Orphan Black. 

Breaking bad."
43242,"Not a show, but both Sicarios have serious True Detective vibes."
43243,I'd recommend fargo. It's really good.
43244,The Danish show ‘Forbrydelsen’ has some of the same vibes. ‘The Killing’ was built from it.
43245,"Hinterland - Y Gwyll, Marcella"
43246,"Bosch was good, and like everyone said MrRobot and Fargo and Mindhunter and Wire."
43247,"ROME on HBO is an outstanding 2 season series featuring main characters with very questionable morals. Also the depiction of ancient Rome in the show is not flattering at all. If you weren't nobility, life fucking sucked and they do not shy away from showing that."
43248,"DARK on Netflix is maybe the greatest show of all time. Only “maybe” because there is one more season left (S1 and S2 are out and there will only be 3 seasons total)... Obviously I have some Game of Thrones PTSD with that caveat... but seriously it’s PHENOMENAL. Magical even.

For what it’s worth, S1 of TD came out two years after I moved to New Orleans (the actress who played Dora Lange was my neighbor I shit you not. ) So I have a very special place in my ❤️ for TDs1 and DARK still beats it by a hair.

Yes it’s German. Yes you have to pay attention. But it’s amazing and worth it. It’s better in subtitles than dubbed, but if you make it to episode 4 or 5 you’ll already be locked in to be watching the series more than once anyway cause it’s that damn good and will blow you mind 🤯 

The way you could tell that Nick P spent the first half of his life crafting S1 of True Detective in his head comes through the same way with the attention to detail and nuance in DARK. 

For what it’s worth here’s my tops:
1) Breaking Bad
2) DARK
3) True Detective S1
4) Fargo

Somewhere else in the top 10ish)
Mindhunter
Select GOT (not s8)
Ozark
Barry
Always Sunny in Philly
Chernobyl 
Fear the walking dead s1-s3 (after season 3 is utter dogshit but before that is exceptional. Just pretend they all die at the end of 3.) 

You’re welcome for anyone who watches DARK because of this rant. Glad I could enrich your life that extra bit. 😉"
43249,"So true..Dark is like nothing I’ve ever experienced. It’s the only show that, imo, is truly mind blowing. (If you watch it high it’s even more intense.) I recommend it to EVERYONE I can. I just wish more people gave it a chance"
43250,The Sinner
43251,"This is what you want, OP. Second season wasn't as good to me, but each season stands alone and totally wraps up a story. 

It's has the same spirit of the shows you love: great acting, believable storytelling, a focus on people, and propulsive plotting."
43252,Try line of duty on Netflix. Real gritty English police corruption drama. Pretty heavy and I thought brilliant.
43253,"Try""The Bureau""  Good espionage show based on French intelligence.. if you don't mind subtitles. It's on Sunland though. 

Killing Eve is good show as well,

And oh...The Night Manager"
43254,"You should really try ""The Blacklist"". You should really check it out. According to what you wrote, I think it's a very good choice."
43255,I have seen early seasons.  I didn't like it that much.
43256,Not be sure if someone mentioned it but “the blacklist “ is an awesome show
43257,I  did see the first season
43258,Person of interest is pretty cool
43260,thank you for the details!
43261,"I’m a big fan of Rectify. It’s a nice slow burn - emphasis on the slow but worth it. It’s been a year and I still drift back to it. 

A few long shot suggestions: 

Justified based on the writing of Elmore Leonard on Amazon. Great snappy dialogue about  Kentucky sheriffs. Great villains. There’s an ongoing arch between the lead hero and villain throughout the entire series and they quit before it went bad. 
 
Longmire - modern day cowboy sheriff. There’s Indian mysticism (mysticism not supernatural), political intrigue, and some very interesting characters. If you do get into this, the lead actor was one of the agents in The Matrix - he had a big part and I doubt you’ll recognize him. 

Banshee - this was a cable series. If you get past the premise you might get into it. It’s a tad over the top with out being cartoonish. Guy gets out of jail. Heads to a small town in Philly. Witnesses the new sheriff being killed and assumes his identity. Tried to play on both sides of the law. Lots of intriguing characters. 

And you said you hate fantasy but the setup of the show and the real life making of is too intriguing. Sense 8. 8 people all over the globe are connected mentally that can draw on each other’s abilities in time of need. Not just action hero stuff but medical knowledge and acting. The show is global in scale. Presents 8 completely different characters and storylines. Beautifully filmed and shot. Multiple scenes are filmed 2-3 times as the characters start merging into each other’s lives. All the characters and storylines are gripping. 
Emphasis on the well written stories and characters. If you start this, try to get to the 3 or 4 episode where the gimmick starts happening. If you hate it by that point feel free to bail knowing you have it a fair shot."
43262,thank you.  I'm not a huge fan of westerns--guess you are.    Thank you and feel free to recommend others
43263,It’s less a western than a cop show in a western setting. Modern day. It’s a western much in the same way as Wind River with Jeremy Renner is a Western

43266,Dark is pretty dark.
43267,thanks.

43276,Dexter also excellent
43277,not getting into it and tried.
43278,"The Spy, Bodyguard"
43280,"Netflix: - The End of the F***king World (dark comedy, “escaping from the cops” theme, short episodes, binge-worthy)
- House of Cards (U.S Version 2013-2018; great political thriller, focuses on corruption and has great narrative, created term “binge-watching”)
- The Spy (short-binge worthy drama that goes straight to the point)
- The Sinner (great psychological crime drama) 
- Sniffer (just try it out at first, crime)
- Jessica Jones (a detective, crime-related, great first season, not as comic book ish as you might think)
- Deathnote (anime — simply incredible, questions morality, very good crime drama)

Amazon Prime: - Mr. Robot (currently on its final season, this show is just great — many genres built into it but for good reason, underrated, a masterpiece imo)
- Beat (German show; focuses on a club murder and then leads into more, suspenseful, fun and interesting)"
43281,thank you.     I watched 1 episode of The Spy and may return to it.   Not into anime/superhero stuff.    Have also seen Mr Robot but did not continue after season 2.
43282,Also Mad Men
43283,a favorite of mine for sure.

43285,"+1 The Expanse, criminally underrated"

43290,If you like medical procedurals (I see The Good Doctor on your list) I suggest giving ER a spin. 15 seasons to enjoy (some are obviously better than others) and since Michael Crichton was involved it's semi accurate.
