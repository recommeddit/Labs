35700,Thad is in the building! I demand respect!
35701,HEY EVERYBODY! ALCOHOL PARTY AT THE GOAT HOUSE!
35702,And cheers to all the Sloots
35703,Show us your knockers!
35704,It rhymes with best bros!
35705,MOJITOS. IM GONNA WHIP US UP A BATCH
35706,GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
35707,What rhymes with best bros? MOJITOS
35708,"Applebees $1 long island iced teas. 



Just kidding. Don't do that to yourself"
35710,"I thought they were 2 dollars, but one or the other exists. Applebee's is dying and doing their best to bring people in."
35712,"Was a bartender at Applebee's

LIIT prep, 1 gallon of sour mix and one 750ml bottle each. gut rot vodka, tequila, white rum, gin. Fill the glass with ice, pour in mix, top with a splash of coke for color and garnish with lemon if you feel like it and it isn't busy."
35713,"I mean, that's a real lit."
35714,"made in a bucket-sized batch just like grandma used to make. 

i miss that rowdy old broad. she knew how to fuckin' party."
35715,Bars at my college kept well drinks in garbage cans.
35716,"I mean as long as it was never used for garbage it’s not really that gross, it’s just a bucket"
35717,Whelp that’s my dinner tonight. And lunch today. And breakfast this morning
35718,"hahaha, that's fucking awesome. I love that their Hail Mary is cheap long islands. wave that booze flag in a last ditch effort to save the ship."
35719,"'what do milennials like to do? someone check buzzfeed!!'

'sir, they apparently like to get drunk for as little money as possible!'

'i've got a plan...'"
35720,A delicious $1 liit to go with my appetizer dinner
35721,"It does. Idk how there aren’t riots but it does exist. Getting clobbered with the boys at Applebee’s eating shitty ass food is a great idea until it isn’t, 3 hours later"
35722,"Sometimes in certain suburban areas, Applebee’s is your only option for staying out late and getting hammered with your friends without paying $50 to uber to a place with a proper nightlife."
35724,"While this deal was going on, we did the Applebee's bar crawl, go to all Applebees in my city and have 3 long islands. The first 3 were okay, the last 3 were the hardest cause we were trashed. We had a DD so no worries there

10/10 would do again"
35725,Moscow Mules are definitely one of the best drinks to try
35726,"Irish Mules

Same as a moscow, but with Jameson"
35727,I see you are a man of culture as well...
35728,"Gonna have to try this, I always have gone with bourbon."
35729,That's a Kentucky Mule.
35730,AKA the Southern Ass
35731,Kentucky Mules too
35732,let me guess...bourbon?
35733,That's a bingo
35734,"Love them, another variation is the ""Dark and Stormy"". Same concept but with dark rum, best with Kraken imo."
35735,"Apparently Gosling's has a license on the name ""Dark n Stormy"" and will sue you if you use another rum in the drink. 

https://vinepair.com/wine-blog/youre-probably-drinking-illegal-dark-n-stormys-youre-also-probably-making-the-drink-wrong/"
35736,"I've never even heard of Gosling's alcohol, didn't know they made it.  That being said, their Ginger Beer is leaps and bounds better than any other brand I've tried and I've tried at least 8 or 9 different brands."
35737,"Came here to champion the Kraken Dark and Stormy, good on you."
35738,Yes. And London Mules - swap out vodka for gin.
35739,"Similar concept, but use gin. Basically gin, lime, mint leaves, cucumber and ginger ale. Probably the finest cocktail I've ever had.  

  

Edit: hehe, wasn't trying to reply to you, was trying to reply to the main post, but by chance I replied to someone who had already made the post I was making."
35740,"If I may make a little adjustment to your recipe, use ginger beer/spicy ginger instead of ginger ale. Total game changer"
35741,anything that tastes like a fruit salad I poured vodka on.
35742,You sound like my kind of drinking buddy.
35743,"I'm a grubby construction worker and I love every fruity, ""girly"" drink there is.  If its blue or red or pink,  that's muy shit."
35744,"I ask of you, what is more manly? Let other people's notions of masculinity dictate *your* beverage choice, or do what you enjoy without paying mind to naysayers?"
35745,"Russians, both black and white.  
Whiskey Sour.  
Sidney Ice Tea if I'm feeling frisky.  
Weißbier, Blondes or Saisons if we're talking beer.  
Something citrusy and semi-dry if we're talking bubbles."
35746,"Off-topic comment here, but I just did a ctrl-f for ""weiss"" and chrome highlighted your ""Weiß"". How clever is that?"
35747,very
35748,Today's my 21st birthday and I need some recommendations!
35749,"I'm sure it's not your first time drinking, but incase you don't know this I will say this:

#If your asshole friend tries to give you a four horseman when you're already drunk, don't drink it, otherwise you're in for a terrible time."
35750,yeah- that.  Or a cement mixer.  The name of that one should give it away though...
35751,"ON my 21st my friends made me do the ""gauntlet"" which was a shot of rumple minze, then a 3 wise men, 4 horsemen and finally a cement mixer. Had to be one right after the other. 10/10 would not recommend."
35752,"Jeez.  On my 21st, people at the bar on the Air Force base I was stuck at just offered to put my drinks, that I chose with no pressure, on their tabs, and invited me to play pool.   I shudder to think what my friends back home would've done to fuck with me, tho..."
35753,"I wish mine was like that, after the gauntlet I remember some beers and several more rumple minze shots, with people other than my friends buying them. Woke up the next day to my roommate cleaning my vomit out of his car telling me to hurry up for our golf tournament.  Somehow it was one of the best rounds of golf I ever played."
35754,They should make a drink called “The Terrible Birthday”
35755,"Also, dont do a 5 star general. Or anything with 151 if youre already drunk."
35756,Yup. Some solid advice that I stupidly ignored to my own demise. I'd also add that if your friends buy you a shot you make damn sure they are buying 2 and drinking one themselves. If they won't drink a cement mixer right after a double shot of rail vodka it might be a sign you shouldn't either.
35757,"Everclear in a solo cup.

Now never drink again."
35758,Probably because that's death.
35759,"I had 193 Everclear once. Then I went on a walk. Ended up walking on the freeway looking for a gas station to get Sunchips. 

And that was after I moved to a new state by myself. Day 3. 

My neighbors hated me."
35760,"Try some classic cocktails, 

Old Fashioned
Manhattan
Last word
Aviation

are all some of my favorites."
35761,White russians are delicious
35763,Not on the rug...
35764,"If you go somewhere that can make it, get a moscow Mule. In a copper cup, preferably."
35766,"Most places have a Stainless inside, I find. Good tip though. I don't want to turn blue."
35767,"Red headed slut, Jager with peach schnapps and a bit of cranberry juice that sits on top."
35768,"> Red headed slut

What do you want?"
35769,"Make a rule and tell your friends. Every two drinks (shots, mixed, beer) MUST be followed by a glass of water.

Have your more sober friends keep you to it even when you “don’t need it”.  Your asshole friends will be the ones trying to get you blackout drunk but the best nights of drinking, IMHO, are the ones where you get 70%blitzed and remember everything.

Happy 21st."
35770,It's so damn hard to sit in that pocket of recollection. It always sucks to wake up and remember having a great time but not be able to remember why.
35771,"1 and a half ounces of Captain Morgan spiced rum  
3 quarter ounce of blue curaco   
3 ounces sour mix  
1 teaspoon of fresh lime* juice  
A splash of grenadine.  
  
This makes for an excellent drink, and I as a mako shark can only recommend it."
35773,"Sandbar in Lawrence, KS makes a tall version of this where the grenadine is given to you in a plastic toy shark.  They call it the Shark Attack."
35774,"21st birthday? Oh no my friend. You don't do a normal mixed drink. You get a long island iced tea followed by shots all night. Just make sure you've got a good DD/babysitter. Also, happy birthday!"
35775,"Long island iced tea. The quickest route to fucktardville I've ever had. That shit will make you teleport.

Edit: apparently many of us have somehow been violated by this drink."
35776,"I make a ""long beach tea"", and my customers loved it that night, hated it the next morning.

White rum, vodka, gin, tequila, triple sec/Gran Marnier, splash of orange, splash of cranberry, simple syrup, and a lime wedge.

If LIITs don't do it for you anymore, step up to this. This will fuck you up."
35777,You're like the Satan of Liquor.
35778,"My response after reading this, at my desk was to whisper *siiiighhhhh* ""Jesus... Here we fuckin go."""
35779,"Very alcoholic, very tasty, very bad idea (for me at least)"
35780,Nothing wrong with some bad decision juice
35781,"Except for like, the bad decisions."
35782,"""Where did I get this child?"""
35783,There is a bar in my town that does a special every Thursday where you can get a PITCHER (about 48 oz) of long island iced tea for $5. I usually just have a couple cheap domestics and watch the madness unfold.
35784,"Yes, I dont like nursing drinks or having to piss a lot with beer.  I wanna get get hammered fast and try to play mario kart 8."
35785,"Finally, someone of my own kind"
35786,long island blockchain?
35787,"I love scotch. I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. Here it goes down. Down into my belly.

Also bourbon."
35788,"It's hard to beat scotch. My old family recipe eggnog comes close. It's 3 parts scotch, 1 part ice and it wouldn't be the holidays without it."
35789,That sound suspiciously like my dad's irish sangria recipe - it's 5-mississippi pour of scotch with a dash of cold water added to it. Are you my family?
35790,Is the dash of cold water frozen into a solid cube? Because that’s how i make it
35791,What's a good Scotch to try for someone new to Scotch?
35792,"I haven't seen any helpful replies here, just expensive scotches with no context, so let me try to help. I've been drinking scotch for around 10 years now, so I can give you an amateurs angle.

First off, there are different 'types' or flavours of scotch that are named after the region of Scotland they are distilled in. The common ones that I see most often are: Islay, Speyside and Highlands. There's also Lowlands and I believe Island malts.

Islay malts have the most distinct flavour compared to others. They are known for being smokey and petey (some people say it's like drinking a campfire, my wife said it smelled like hotdogs). While everyone's palate is different, I very seldom have come across someone who like Islay malts when they started drinking scotch. It took me 7 years to start enjoying some peat in my whiskey. The best known Islay malt is Lavagulin 16 (the fave of Ron Swanson) but there are [7 other distillers in that region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay_whisky). If you want my advice, **don't** start with an Islay malt.

The most popular scotches in the world, Glenlivet and Glenfiddich (pronounce it fid-itch or fid-ick, either way someone will correct you) are both from the Speyside region. Speyside malts are a great place to start. If you drink beer, think of it like introducing someone to beer with a lager. Pretty classic stuff. These are a great starting point. Don't listen to elitists, you don't need your first scotch to be an $80-$100 scotch (I'm Canadian so in US dollars I think expensive is $50-$70. These scotches are sweet, a bit grassy, smooth and quite good. Pick one of those two that I mentioned. Start there and enjoy it. If you like it, move up $20 or so.

Once you like that, give the Balvenie Doublewood 12 Year Old a try. That's a Speyside with some awesome character. It's one of my standbys. 

Highland malts are awesome to try as well (my two faves are highland malts). Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old is an excellent malt, and my absolute favourite scotch: Oban 14 Year Old is a Highland malt as well. 

Bottom line, start small and ease into it. Try stuff slowly. If you can, try a sip out of someone else's bottle (most scotch drinkers are happy to pour a couple glasses and have a drink with a friend) before buying a whole bottle. 

Tl;Dr: Start with Glenfiddich or Glenlivet (12 year for either) then work up from there. This advice will fit 90% of new scotch drinkers. 

EDIT: lol It's Glenfiddich. My bad. Dunno where my brain was. I don't drink it often (I pick Glenlivet between the two)."
35793,I'm one of those people who immediately gravitated towards islay malts when I first tried scotch. Still think Laphroig is one of the most heavenly substances out there.
35794,"Yup same. Never liked whisky until I tried a peaty one. Now I've got a few ardbegs, coal Ila, lagavulin, Kilchoman, Laphroaig and Talisker dark storm sitting on my shelf."
35795,Amaretto Sour
35796,"love a whisky sour too, don't really drink it in any other form but those bad boys don't even touch the sides."
35797,"I love both of these drinks, and I *especially* love the combination.

My preferred recipe is:

2oz Disaronno, 1 oz lemon juice, 1 oz simple syrup, 1 oz bourbon, just a pinch of salt.

It's so good."
35798,Tito's Vodka + Club Soda + Slice of Lime
35799,Tito's & La Croix
35800,Yessss key lime la croix
35801,Are you Burnt Chrysler?
35802,Definitely not. He didn't say double in a 32oz Styrofoam cup.
35803,Goes down like water
35804,"This is a go-to for me, but I have recently gotten into Tito's+ Fresca. It's some refreshing ass shit."
35805,White Russians
35806,"I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't have a normal White Russian. Fortunately you can make a pretty good version using almond milk instead of half and half. I call it a Nut Russian."
35807,"You could call it a Rasputin, because apparently cyanide smells like almonds"
35808,"This is brilliant, nicely done."
35809,Almond milk White Russians taste so much better. The sweetness of the almonds enhances all the other flavors and makes your shitty vodka taste less shitty.
35810,My roommate made a brown Russian the other day when we only had chocolate milk. Not sure how it went.
35811,I mean it sounds good
35812,"Careful man,  there's a beverage here!"
35813,"That's just like, your opinion, man"
35814,"I will admit that I first tried this soon after I started drinking because of The Big Lebowski (probably like most other people my age), but it really is my favorite drink.  It's like a boozy, coffee flavored milkshake.  It's delicious.

When I was in Iceland last year, we went to a bar in Reykjavik called Lebowski Bar, where they had 21 different kinds of White Russian.  I was in heaven."
35817,beer
35818,Lord beer me strength
35819,"Why the hell is that so far down? Long Island Ice Tea? Moscow Mule? ""Tito's Vodka + Club Soda + Slice of Lime""? Reddit, sometimes it's like I don't even know you anymore..."
35820,"In no particular order (and not all of them tonight)

* Margarita - I like rocks no salt. 
* Mint Julep - Kentucky Derby is coming up
* Vodka Tonic - When i started drinking I thought gin tasted like pine tree and hair spray (I've grown to like it). The easy work-around is Vodka Tonic and lime. If its hot or if you're drinking for a while, this is the go to drink.  
* Moscow Mule, a classic but a good one. 
* Pina Colada (or any daiquiri) - Come summer, yes please.
* Mimosa - Careful, champagne sneaks up on you. 
* Fruity Tropical Drinks - (mai tai, rum runner, hurricane) there's a time and a place for these and they're wonderful. As an everyday drink, not so much. 
* White Russian - its not the 90's and you're kind of an asshole if you order one at a bar, but everyone should try one once. 
* Irish Coffee - if its cold on a Sunday morning, and you understand that there's like .5% alcohol in it. 
* Red Wine - Save that for when you're older. Waking up to a red puke-stained toilet bowl in your 20s is less than fun. 
* Sake - I love sake, but again, time and place. Nobody just orders a sake at a bar. But, if the mood is right, and you'll know, it is good stuff. 
* Tequila Sunrise/Screwdriver - Try it. If you like it, good. Most people are ho-hum on it. 
* Beers - probably the safest bet on your 21st. I like darks, but all the beer snobs like IPAs, find what you like and stick to it. For my money, there's nothing better than a Guinness. 

And

* A Bloody Mary tomorrow morning. Btw, there's a huge difference between a good Bloody Mary (spicy, zesty, good consistency) and watered down tomato juice. 

Happy Birthday BTW!

EDIT: OH SHIT! I FORGOT MY FAVORITE DRINK: THE CUBA LIBRE. Drink these all night amigo."
35821,Dr. Pepper and rum
35822,"Ah yes, the classic Doc Morgan."
35823,I call this one the doctor captain pepper morgan
35824,I tried mixing a few different things with Dr. Pepper the other week but I found that nothing tasted as good as just unadulterated Dr. Pepper.
35825,"Beer, definitely beer, s much variety, so many tastes, god I love beer."
35826,"I used to hate beer, now I'm at that point were I come home from work and have one with dinner because I love the taste. God it goes so well with anything salty."
35827,"> God it goes so well with anything salty.

Absolutely.

I never saw the appeal in beer. It was bitter and tasted like ass. Do people just tolerate the taste because it gets them drunk? Why not just drink a different form of alcohol?

Now it's like my go-to. Best with salty foods, particularly junk food lol. Nothing beats a hearty ale!"
35828,What changed? I’m one of those people that hates the taste of beer but I want to like it
35830,Hate life. Still won't drink beer. Whiskey it is!
35831,Vodka Sprites. Can put garbage vodka and still tastes fine. Goes down like water.
35833,Can't go wrong with jack and coke
35834,How the hell do you know OP! You're just turning 21!
35835,A friend told him ;)
35836,Lagavulin 16.
35837,Anything Laphroaig gets my vote with Talsiker being quite nice as well.
35838,Try Ardbeg if you like laphroaig
35839,Ron?
35840,51% shares right here. The rest are in gold buried under a tree.
35841,"Guess it depends on the occasion:

- Nothing beats a good wine with a fine meal

- Nothing beats beer at a hot summerday"
35842,"Yep, there is something transcendental  about how the much-maligned, cheap, shitty lager, when drunk ice-cold in the shade on a blazing hot day, surrounded by pleasant company and goodwill, at that moment becomes the purest liquid to pass human lips; a veritable ambrosia. 

It always make me think of that scene in the Shawshank Redemption:

>And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49 wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Bohemia-style beer, courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison...The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous. We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses. We were the Lords of all Creation."
35843,">Yep, there is something transcendental about how the much-maligned, cheap, shitty lager, when drunk ice-cold in the shade on a blazing hot day, surrounded by pleasant company and goodwill, at that moment becomes the purest liquid to pass human lips; a veritable ambrosia.

That is fucking poetry my dude"
35844,"No much of a drinker, but I like Guinness. Maybe some Jameson neat on the side. Then a nap."
35845,There has to be some true Irishman in you sir
35846,Gin.
35847,and tonic.
35848,With a lime
35849,In a cup
35850,with gin in it
35851,And maybe some tonic
35853,the cup part is important
35854,And the tonic
35855,And the gin
35856,"I've been having gin with club soda instead of tonic water, and a shot of lavender Torani syrup. It's amazing."
35857,I usually just drink cider because I do not enjoy the taste of alcohol. Maybe it is an acquired taste.
35858,Ethanol and any drink that contains it.
35859,But easy on the methanol
35860,i can't read this comment
35861,"One of everything in these comments.

And don't forget a good margarita."
35862,Dark and Stormy.

35867,mead
35868,Mead is my favorite too. I make it as a hobby so I've always got tons of it laying around
35869,Old Fashioned. I'm a whiskey guy and it's a cocktail that I know I will enjoy at pretty much any bar because it is so simple.
35870,"Oh man, as a fellow Old Fashioned fan, I've found I actually CAN'T enjoy it at most bars.  I've become a snob.  If it's not made how I make it at home, or at least similarly, I just end up complaining internally about how I want to go home and make it right."
35871,"MY favorite, is moonshine.

Homemade moonshine is best."
35872,"I've had some apple pie moonshine from a store that was pretty strong , I can't even imagine what homemade would taste like."
35873,Commercial moonshine is pretty much garbage compared to the real thing unfortunately. It just doesn’t taste the same as the shit your buddy’s grandpa has squirreled away and won’t tell you who makes it. Most of the time commercial stuff is just as strong as your typical hard liquors at 40% abv too. Gimme some of that real peach pie or real apple pie moonshine and I’ll be your friend forever! Getting blasted on that stuff is truly a unique experience.
35874,"Plymouth Gin, love that shit."
35876,"I believe you mean ""Cuba Libre"""
35877,"That's was actually dating advice, I think"
35878,"Belgian beer. Best beer in the world.

(A few favourites would be Chimay Blue, St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Westvleteren 12, Waterloo and Tripel Karmeliet - that last one is really sweet and tasty, but still has a good deep beer taste. It’s great!)"
35879,Unibroue (Canada) makes some fine Belgian style beers too.
35880,"Seasoned drinker/lifter here --> Vodka with Diet Tonic and a squirt of lime juice.  It's cheap on the calories since Diet Tonic has 0 calories, and vodka is a pretty clean, lean spirit.  A little bit of lime juice (fresh squeezed for out of the plastic limes you find at the store) helps to round out the flavor and make it refreshing."
35881,"I also agree, gin in place of vodka works too.
And drinking a glass of water between drinks does wonders."
35882,"Flavored vodka and club soda.

No extra sugar, keeps you relatively hydrated, and you can reach for the lower shelf booze if your wallet isn't too full.

Of course if you are not a vodka drinker, I would suggest any other hard liquor with (again) club soda. Things like tonic water, on, and Redbull are loaded with HFCS in most bars.

35883,">tonic water..... Loaded with HFCS

I have never been more crushed. And my lady friend recently left me and kept our kid."
35884,Make friends with diet tonic water
35885,i wish there was tonic water just without sugar or sugar substitute
35886,Club soda?
35887,never seen club soda with quinine in it
35888,What's the appeal of quinine?  Taste?
35889,"Gotta watch out for malaria, bro."
35890,"It's gotta be hard on your gains, for sure."
35891,"Way back when the British drank club soda with quinine to fight off malaria while colonizing India and Africa.  Their preferred hard liquor was gin, and through a happy accident, we get G & Ts!  That's why it's a health ""tonic."""
35892,"I thought I read somewhere that they put gin in tonic water to make the tonic taste better.

54583,yeah
35896,"A thought - try vodka, club soda, and a splash of bitters. Bitters are made with grain alcohol, so no HFCS"
35897,My favorite: vodka soda with lime
35898,"Yes, definitely. And no one would drink from your drink as most people think that it tastes like medicine."
35899,"Q tonic

It uses agave nectar though. Better, not artificial sweet flavor, but still some sugar"
35900,"I have been wanting to try this small batch Tonic from this company.  Cane Sugar used.[Jack Rudy Cocktail Co](http://jackrudycocktailco.com/purchase/mixers/small-batch-tonic/)

35901,"You can mix sparkling water (i use a sodastream to carbonate plain water...or you could use a flavored or unflavored Lacroix) with vodka. If you go with an unflavored water you throw in a splash of lime or lemon juice. Simple, no sugar beyond what may be in the vodka or lime juice, and it'll get you drunk if you so wish."
35902,Afraid so brother - they DO make a diet version. Most bars do not carry it though.
35903,"My friend's ex was a semi-pro bodybuilder and while on cuts, did this drinking routine that he called The Skinny Russian. He'd start with two and a half shots of straight vodka. Then he'd sip club soda with ice. Then after exactly an hour, he'd take another shot of vodka to maintain his buzz. He'd continue this until two hours before he'd plan to stop drinking. It seemed to work really well for him."
35904,the fact that he only did 2.5 shots is really something to me. why not just go for 3...

I'll be damned if I can't go ridiculously ham while drinking club soda in between, then wake up the next morning with no symptoms. I'd say it could be just luck but I've done it so many times that it's not longer just anecdote to me.

Here's just one article, it has links to the study and stuff, I just wanna show I'm not talking out of my ass http://greatist.com/health/best-hangover-cure-soda-101013"
35913,What a fucking dork.
35914,"why not just drink whiskey or rum straight? seems like they would be the best ""low calorie"" drinks, plus whiskey and rum is awesome and doesn't need a mix anyways."
35915,"Oh totally!

But it is summertime, so a ""nice cold drink"" is usually on the list for most folks."
35916,Maker's on the rocks. Done.

35918,This man knows the way to my heart
35919,"Gotta be careful with some of the flavored vodkas as they will have added sugar, Pinnacle, Van Gogh, and Deep Eddy come to mind. 

I'm a big fan of any Stoli or Absolut, mixed with either club soda or water. The new Svedka flavors, pineapple mango and strawberry lemonade mixed with water are delicious."
35920,I tried bloody Mary's once I used pretty horrible vodka though. Popov I figured all the good things would make the shit vodka taste good.... It didn't and killed my work out the next day. But a better brand of vodka and club soda does sound like a good idea.
35921,"If you wouldn't drink it straight,  don't drink it at all."
35922,Teens can drink anything straight.
35923,"Gah, my friends and i would pull our cash together and buy some cheap plastic jug vodka. it was terrible. i have absolutely no clue how i was able to drink that."
35924,"Been there done that, have had enough plastic handle vodka for a life time, don't even touch plastic anymore."
35926,Which flavors have you liked the most? some of the flavored ones are really not good.
35927,I prefer stoli. Generally stoli-O (orange). Or citron (lemon flavored) and Soda work well to mask the taste.
35928,whiskey or whisky.  but i tend to really drag the next day no matter what i'm drinking.
35929,"hey we're name brothers

also, we drink too much whiskey

35930,High 5 name bro!!
35931,got to love that macallan
35932,I had my first glass of macallen last Friday when my bosses phone alarm went off at 2PM and informed me it's now scotch Friday
35933,That sounds so much better than Hawaiian shirt Friday
35934,"You wouldn't happen to be from Wisconsin, would you?"
35935,I'll be ordering fingers of whiskey next weekend if the bars don't have Diet 7Up. Whiskey is a great low calorie drink but hangovers are dependent on the person.
35936,"Don't forget the a glass of water every once in a while,  dodge that hangover."
35937,Or you could just wake up still drunk.
35938,That's what I try to avoid.
35939,That's usually my goal. Best way to avoid a hangover is to never stop drinking.
35940,You can't drink all day if you don't start early.
35941,"""If I stop drinking I'm afraid the cumulative hangover will kill me""  -Archer"
35942,I hope you don't actually refer to them as fingers when ordering.
35943,"Yay whisky! It kicks in fast. Isn't fattening. Has a cleaner hangover than wine (my other favorite). Sits on my stomach better than beer. And it's an acquired taste, so no one drinks all my alcohol. Plus I look so manly drinking it.

Yay whisky!"

35945,"Mmmmm natty ice, the dieters choice."
35946,"Pro Tip:


Go buy some lime juice in the fake little plastic limes you find at the grocery store.  Squirt a couple squeezes of lime into the natty ice.  The acidity and small amount of sweetness will take the edge off of the bitterness, and you can pound those puppies.


I have good taste in beer, but I can choke down 4-5 natties with some lime juice if I'm trying to cut."

35953,Lime juice in the natty ice...JV or all balls?
35954,"JV bro, putting lime in your Natty Ice will get you kicked out of Delta Fu."
35955,JV
35956,"Hell yeah Bro, shoutout to Poochie's uncle."
35957,All balls
35958,"A natty ice has 157 calories. 4-5 of those isn't going to help you cut at all. That's 600-750+ calories, which is the same as 2-3 bombers of something really good. If you have good taste in beer, why do you do that to yourself?"
35959,"Pretty sure his goal is buzzed/drunk for the lowest amount of calories, not enjoyment of taste."
35960,I wouldn't put a fire out with that shit. What beers do you enjoy?
35961,West Coast IPAs for the most part.
35962,ninkasi total domination ftw
35963,I gotcha. Not exactly subtle stuff. I can see choking down natty if you mostly enjoy more offensive tastes.
35964,Natural Ice: because there's more to beer than taste

35976,Wish I'd have known this was a thing in college
35977,">But I feel like beer just has so many calories makes me not work out as hard the next day.

Thats not how it works... Thats not how any of this works."
35978,Yep worded that sentence stupid. I know the alcohol is what makes me work out shitily. Right..... Right....
35979,"http://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/lifters-guide-to-alcohol

You'd be surprised."
35980,I un-fitness you.
35981,I always feel shitty after eating a ton of carbs. Seems like a completely reasonable statement to me.
35982,"i think magister meant that a calorie spike the day before a workout doesn't destroy workouts (in fact, broadly speaking, it helps--replenishing glycogen, etc).  if op doesnt want to work out hard the day after beer-drinking, the obvious reason is that op is hungover.  to suggest its the carbs or the calories is kinda like eating a meth-filled apple right before your best workout ever, then suggesting that the key to good workouts is apples.  it's possible that it was the little sugar spike that gave you that great surge of energy, but magister would suggest it may be the meth"
35983,Are you recommending meth as a pre-workout?
35984,Doesn't everyone?
35988,Praise Jesus and so forth that you didn't die. Holy shit!

35993,Yeah rice and potatoes fuck up your body. /s
35994,You're probably intolerant to gluten.
35995,Going to upvote this in the hope that it's sarcasm!
35996,I'm going to assume you are kidding and doing your best WebMD impression.
35997,Is that just more likely to be due to over eating?
35998,"Thinking you will get any viable answer here is naive. 

Alkohol will always fuck with your body and thus your workout the next day. Less alcohol means better fitness the next day. It is simple as that.

The only difference you can make is to drink lots of water and eat something before you go to sleep to refill lost supplements and liquid."
35999,I agree. I'm expecting to have some degree of loss when drinking. But God damn it I fucking like it. Just seeing if there is a way to lessen the blow is all. Maybe the super secret drink that actually helps your work out and gets your drunk off your ass. Even though there is no way that exists.
36000,"You either have to understand that progress is going to slow down and drink a fuckton of water which means you won't get a buzz going most likely or even come close to being drunk. Or you only drink on off days from the gym. My only day for drinking for awhile will be Saturday afternoon/evenings and even at that point, they won't be frequent. All in the name of the cut."
36001,cocaine.
36002,"Reading your replies in this thread, I'm fearful you'll forget to breathe and accidentally choke to death while you sleep."
36003,I really dont want to be rude /u/izbsleepy1989 but I kinda agree with this guy.
36004,"To lessen the blow, lessen the alcohol intake"
36005,http://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/lifters-guide-to-alcohol
36006,"The calories from the carbs in beer would *help* your workout, if anything. What's actually hurting your workouts is the alcohol itself.  
  
So basically the answer is no."
36007,"I usually have a protein shake and a vitamin b-12 before going out. 
Once I'm drinking I just keep it simple, vodka water lime or a beer. Though, I have noticed that if I eat healthy and keep up with my salads I don't have any hangover at all."
36008,I dont know how you do this. Everytime I drink with nothing but a protien shake in my belly I get really drunk and take a shit explosive enough to qualify for NASA.
36009,That first shot or beer with a protein shake residing in there turns my stomach into an acidic vat so strong they could polish gold in it.
36010,"I usually have less than 20g of protein in the shake and add a bannana along with some peanut butter. Thats weird you get diarrhea though, I usually have a no wiper."
36011,My stomach never adapted well to a lot of liquid considering I take protien twice a day.  I usually throw in some powdered oats for fiber and it helps immensely.
36012,"nobody's said it yet but this is a low-calorie way to get extremely drunk:

Picklebacks.   Ok, bear with me. 

Take a shot of bourbon (say, jim beam or something even cheaper) and chase it with a shot of pickle juice.  Vinegar or salt pickles, not sweet ones.  Pickles and pickle juice contain next-to-no calories, and straight whiskey is about as low-cal as it's possible to get while still consuming booze. 

Sounds gross, (and I didn't believe this either, at first) but the pickle juice really neutralizes the bourbon taste/feel.  It washes your whole situation clean, readying you for another shot.  Protip: 3 at a time or fewer!

If you really hate both of those things, it won't work, but if you can tolerate pickles you should find it delightful."
36013,or you can just not be a pussy and drink bourbon neat the way it's meant to be drunk.
36014,"yeah. not sure why would you want to ""neutralize the bourbon taste/feel"""
36015,I went out with some Polish people and they did this with vodka. It was not nearly so bad as I imagined it would be.
36016,"Pickle juice is great for hydrating as well. I can't remember who, but there was a NFL coach who would keep it on the sideline."
