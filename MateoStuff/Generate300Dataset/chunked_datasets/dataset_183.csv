60042,Love & Sunshine was so good but it is discontinued ðŸ˜«
60043,"I didnâ€™t know they discontinued it! Bummer, itâ€™s my go to fresh smell"
60044,"Getting way into vetiver frags and got a travel spray of guerlain vetiver. Must say I'm impressed, mature and sophisticated with incredible staying power on me. 1961 classic still smelling great, at an outstanding value."
60045,"I like Jessica Simpsons Fancy - You can find it for Â£22-26. I bought it earlier this year and I must say, it's fantastic for the price."
60046,I saw that at Ross for around $25 but they do not have testers.  I'm  trying to stop blind-buying. Can't  wait for this lock down to end.
60047,"If youâ€™ve ever smelled Viva La Juicy Gold Couture, it smells exactly like that. Itâ€™s basically a dupe in my opinion. However, Gold Couture is more well blended to my nose."
60048,"Interesting, I didn't know that. I have not smelled any Juicy Couture fragrances. I did a quick google search and that one is relatively cheap (Â£33) but not as cheap as Fancy."
60049,The one I have is a body spray that cost around $8. Probably why I think Gold couture is more balanced lol
60050,that sounds ideal to be honest!
60051,"Ulric Varens is nice. I have [Sublime](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ulric-de-Varens/Sublime-26122.html) and it doesnâ€™t smell cheap at all. I got it for like $11.

Mariah Carey [M](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mariah-Carey/M-1151.html) is hella unexpectedly good. Iâ€™m also fond of all of the Britney Spears perfumes Iâ€™ve smelled, especially [Curious](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Britney-Spears/Curious-141.html)

Perfumers Workshop [Tea Rose](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Perfumer-s-Workshop/Tea-Rose-5512.html) is great. It smells really similar to some more expensive rose scents. I think I got my 1oz bottle for $6 including shipping.

The nose behind Elizabeth Arden [Green Tea](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elizabeth-Arden/Green-Tea-83.html) is Francis Kurkdjian (it also costs less than $10)

Also, Salvador Dali perfumes tend to be really cheap and I really like the ones Iâ€™ve tried. La Rive makes really decent dupes of designer scents for incredibly cheap. Alsoâ€”shoutouts to both Demeter and Bath and Body Works. Both have a ton of scents I like."
60052,Ferragamo f black
60053,Nautica voyage
60054,"Probably Versace Eros, it was on sale for 20usd for 100ml (3.3 oz.) I Bought 5, should last me a long while."
60055,Wow. I was happy to find it under $40.
60056,"Yeah, the minimum wage where I live is 300-325 USD a year, so they have to keep the prices somewhat cheap to be able to sell their products."
60057,"* Caron Pour un Homme and Yatagan



* Lâ€™Occitane Eau des Baux, Eau de Cade and Lâ€™Occitan


* Maja Mygurgia (vintage). You can get the vintage formula for a tenner on eBay / in thrift shops etc.


* Coty Lâ€™Aimant


* Not gonna lie I like the Britney Spears Fantasy range. Not all of it mainly Fantasy and Midnight Fantasy.


*  The Body Shop Smoky Poppy"
60058,"If we're talking about fragrances under $25... that can be difficult, but there are some.

If you go to places like Burlington or TJ Maxx you can find Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely for an absolute steal. It's a beautiful, inexpensive clean musky floral that smells like it should retail for far more $$$ than it is. You'll also probably find CK One, it's a soft lemon-citrus scent that smells heavenly in the summer. You can also find Elizabeth Arden perfumes, Estee Lauder perfumes, many different celebrity perfumes, and some of the lower end designer perfumes at a significant discount. If you're on a budget I wouldn't recommend blind buying anything, look up the notes online and sniff anything that seems to be up your alley.

At the drugstore: for the low price Jovan Musk is good, and Coty's Wild Musk is another good one. You  have to enjoy the slightly more dirty musks though, they are both a bit animalic. They are not too challenging but they are not clean musks. You also might find Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose, a fantastic rose soliflore that goes for dirt cheap. The drugstore will probably have inexpensive dupes of designer perfumes as well, I'd definitely check em out.

As mentioned by many others, check out Pacifica's perfumes at Target. The fragrances are better than you'd expect and around $20-$25 for 1 oz. I was most impressed by French Lilac, I ended up buying it. In my opinion the other standouts are Himalayan Patchouli Berry (good fruitchouli), Tuscan Blood Orange (decent fruity orange scent), and Tahitian Gardenia (Tiare Flower soliflore). I was unimpressed by the vanillas, I'd reccomend skipping them. Also at Target is the brand Mix:Bar, their fragrance Bourbon Vanilla is much better than Pacifica's vanillas imo."
60059,"Agent Provacateur is a great, sexy, musky rose which you can buy online in big bottles very cheap. I know Iâ€™ve bought enough gallons of it for the ex (her favourite)
Juicy Couture a surprisingly good white floral also dead cheap
Lolita Lempika ditto
Tommy Girl/Tommy ditto
Encre Noire and its flankers - menâ€™s classic as previously noted by others
Guerlain Vetiver - large bottles are great value for this classic Vetiver 
Middle eastern shops for great value frags by unknown names in a rose/oud vein
Lush - amazing scents at great prices eg Breath of God"
60060,The tea rose
60061,"They sell small bottles of scent at Old Navy, and several of those are very good."
60062,"CÃ¢line Fleur Noir, it's very similar to YSL Black Opium, but 1) it's not as cloying, bit more Orange blossom, 2) It's 60ml for like 6â‚¬. One of the best dupes for me by far.

Also enjoy Karl Lagerfeld's recent perfume releases, especially Tokyo Shibuya. Very powdery, elegant and quince-y. Not as cheap, but still very cheap!"
60063,"Thereâ€™s a perfume called Wanderer Horizon that may only be available at Walmart, and itâ€™s $25 for 3.3 oz. Its a burnt sugar fragrance with INCREDIBLE lasting power. To me itâ€™s good not great, but above all, that scent gets me so many compliments from men. Like, more than my $100 fragrances."
60064,"I actually blind-bought several of those Wanderer ones for like, $3 each at Walmart. None of them really interested me, but none were bad, either. I remember I had to wait like, 20 minutes for a clerk to come and unlock the cabinet LOL."
60065,"Haha, thatâ€™s the only reason I picked them up in the first place, too! If I hadnâ€™t found them at a crazy sale price, I probably wouldnâ€™t have tried them at all. In my opinion, Horizon is the standout, itâ€™s just nothing revolutionary."
60066,"Yeah, the only reason I bought them was because they were on clearance. Some people buy lottery tickets. I buy frags on clearance LOLOL. Still gambling, I guess, but they said I could return them if I wanted to. I guess they can't be that bad, if I didn't bother to return them."
60067,Aramis - Devin.
60068,Lattafa Raghba Wood Intense
60069,Lalique White $25
60070,"Armaf Derby Clubhouse Gold. 100 ml for $20 and my wife can't get enough of it.

From what I can tell, Armaf has some amazing cheapies and clones, including several Creed knockoffs (Milestone for Millesime Imperial, Sillage for Silver Mountain Water) that some people actually prefer to the original."
60071,Paris Hilton for Men (the blue bottle) is the bees knees and a easy go-to.
60072,Thereâ€™s this one by Soap & Glory that I used to love but I donâ€™t know if they make it anymore.
60073,I just picked up Mist You Madly at TJ Maxx the other day and I love slathering myself in the matching lotion and spritzing myself while pretending I am a fancy housewife in a luxurious feathery robe.
60074,Haha I love it! Thatâ€™s the actual whole vibe of all of the soap and glory products I feel like ðŸ˜‚
60075,I have a lot of their body lotions and soaps. I didn't  know they made frags.
60076,"This is the only one I can vouch for but Iâ€™m sure they all smell amazing! And if I remember correctly, it lasts quite awhile too. 

https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap--glory-original-pink-fragrance-spritz/ID=300398238-product?ext=gooKBM_PLA+-+Beauty+(2019+Update)Beauty__pla_with_promotion_online&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvr6EBhDOARIsAPpqUPGtugF6VED0DtN3uKT3IXL3JxW9NsQOGVtH2NPD5a9XgvTf9LlQiJwaAvb9EALw_wcB#page-content"
60077,"They used to make an actual perfume too, instead of just a body spray, but I think it got discontinued sadly."
60078,I freaking love Gingham
60079,Salvatore Ferragamo Acqua Essenziale Colonia (Blu is also very nice but rarely at this price)
60080,"Jovan Secret Amber and Avon Today. Ciara by Revlon as well, and that one you can find for under $10, but as someone else said, other people may not like it on you as much as you do, lol... it's kind of dated smelling, though divine"
60081,Escada Magnetism. If it's not $25 or less then it's damn near close.
60082,"If you like Sand & Sable try Jennifer Aniston edp (formerly known as Lolavie). It has a tropical pikake  jasmine vibe. Kind of reminds me of Johnson's baby shampoo but the 80's formula.

I do love cheapies for when I want something light, simple and pleasant because I am not looking to wear something complex every single day. I tend to prefer higher end designer or niche when looking for complexity though. Gotta love some of those drugstore classics too.

Skin Musk by Bonne Belle (unless Coty or some company took over) simple baby oil smell. I love that.

Coty Wild Musk almost the same as Skin Musk but even lighter. Great if you want something light but barely there light. 

Jovan Amber Musk great amber but not very lasting at all.

Jovan White Musk

Jovan Musk a light citrus neroli musk.

Alfred Sung Shi tranquil water floral with steamed rice note.

Alfred Sung Jewel light and juicy featuring frangipani and coconut.

Eau De Dali by Salvador Dali powdery green floral with light citrus notes.

Salvador Dali Purple Light is a cute, green lilac.

Elizabeth Taylor Violet Eyes peony, rose, peach with an impressive cedar note. I am not usually a fan of cedar-y frags either.

Vanilla Fields

Vanilla Musk

Terranova China Rain oil

Pacifica French Lilac as others mentioned.

Kuumba Made oils are mostly good.

My favorite out of all these would have to be the Sand & Sable you mentioned with Jennifer Aniston edp coming in at a close second."
60083,Salvador Dali made perfumes????
60084,"Yes. Well, his brand does anyways. One of the most famous women's perfume of his fragrance house is Laguna which is fruity and strong in a tropical sort of way. A lot of his bottles have lips and noses or the actual glass bottle is a big set of lips and the large cap is a nose lol"
60085,I've  been to a lot of perfume shops and I've  never seen them. He used to be one of my favorite artists until I  read Black Dahlia Avenger.
60086,"I would say Paris Hiltonâ€™s Fairy Dust I got it as a Christmas gift and then bought a second one at a drug store for $12 it smells a lot like Juicy Couture 

I've even had people think it was Juicy Couture lol

I also like the Taylor Swift Wonderstruck a lot I got it for $20-$25"
60087,philosophy falling in love
60088,"**Perry Ellis 360 red** is amazing! 

Cheap with decent performance and above all it has a very similar vibe with the worlds best fresh perfume ' Armani AQUA DI GIO"""
60089,"Love Spell by Victoriaâ€™s Secret :) 
I love the body spray and use it as my gym scent. For something more seductive I like Bombshell!"
60090,I love that one too!
60091,"My favourite cheap perfume was Taylor Swift Enchanted Wonderstruck. Itâ€™s probably my favourite perfume Iâ€™ve ever owned. It got discontinued I think and now itâ€™s selling for $70-$100 :( 

If anyone knows a close dupe Iâ€™m all ears!"
60092,"It never gets mentioned but Tommy Bahama - St. Bartâ€™s is one of my favorite scents regardless of price, the fact that you can find it for like $17 makes it THAT MUCH BETTER.

how i wish it was an EDT though."
60093,"I tried most other TB frags and they all suffer from performance issues, sadly."
60094,"Cool Water deodorant spray 12 dollars.. hard to beat it. My most fav cheapies has been mostly reformulated or discontinued,but I'll list them anyway, I loved Pumas's Flowing. Jil Sander Sun Men, Diesel Plus Plus Masculine, a bunch of other's that I got for 30-ish per bottle but I won't list them."
60095,Oui l'amour Yves Rocher. Got the 30ml and I love it
60096,I thought that was an expensive one
60097,"I got a set of the 30ml perfume, lotion and shower gel for 30 dollars. For context, I live in Kenya."
60098,yves rocherâ€™s transat (2006) and eryo (2002) theyre both discontinued :(
60099,Chrome UNITED
60100,"Out of my personal collection it would be Versace the dreamer, absolutely expensive smelling and is around 30â‚¬, and Hugo Boss man extreme, fantastic fresh clean but not at all boring and long lasting - also around 30â‚¬."
60101,I love Sand And Sable and Trisha Yearwood
60102,Rasasi's Qasamat Morhaf.
60103,"Jaguar Classic Gold, Zara RWA, Reyanne Gentle Elsatys, Nautica Voyage"
60104,Definitely Dana Tabu for 13 bucks. I smelled it and if I didn't buy it myself I would've never guessed it was a cheap perfume I think it smells so boujie lol
60105,versace blue jeans!
60106,"Has to be Azzaro Chrome... Slightly more than your 25 and under suggestion, but for what you pay, you end up smellimg pretty damn good."
60107,"My favourite cheapies are discontinued: Crazy Libellule and the Poppies Encense Mystique, Pacifica Tibetan Mountain Temple, and Lush Potion.

As for ones that are still available

\- Lalique Encre Noir (dark and earthy vetivert)

\- Smell Bent Sunshine (sandalwood creamsicle)

\- Tokyo Milk Waltz (linden, rose, musk)

\- A couple Hove scents: Jardin de Louis (orange, greenery, cloves), Diverti (lemon blossom, cedar, sandalwood), El Capitan (anise, rum, powder, cedar)"
60108,"Azzaro Visit. I had previously mentioned in a few comments my love for Gucci Rush. After it was discontinued, this was the closest thing to it. I also recently picked picked up Eau de Rochas after researching good citrus frags. Apparently it was big in the early 90s. It's really solid and I'm digging it a lot right now"
60109,Noble fig by Ferarri. It lifts my mood every time I smell it. It's a very bright fragrance that I choose to wear on lazy days.
60110,Brainiac by Good Chemistry! Discontinued I believe ðŸ˜­
60111,"I remember liking David Beckham signature for him, but it lasts like 2 minutes"
60112,"Demeter, but the staying power sucks. I used to have caramel and you can smell it from a few feet away, but it only lasted 1-2 hours."
60113,Encre noire extreme
60114,"I'll cast another vote for pacifica! 

I tried French Lilac and it was a very believable butterfly bush scent. Decent strength and longevity without being too much. I ordered a rollerball of that, Persian Rose - which I wore in 2017 and remember loving, and Himalayan Patchouli Berry which was a blind buy because it sounded really nice. 

I noticed Persian Rose wasn't at ulta anymore and I could only find it on the pacifica website so I'm scared they'll discontinue it :("
60115,Jovan musk. Chrome by azzaro.
60116,"Moustache EDP,  can be found for 25â‚¬ in my country"
60117,"I have a GE that has been great. My dad gave it to me. He owned it probably 10 years. I have had it for 3. No signs of it stopping. With that being said, I have to tell you that I hate the chest freezer and my next one will be a stand up freezer because then you can actually organize it and SEE what you have. I feel like I cannot fill the chest freezer to capacity because then I cannot get to things at the bottom. It blows. So I would really consider that when looking. 

As far as not losing meat, I have a thermometer on it that is wireless. It sounds an alarm to a home base (located in my kitchen) when the temp rises above freezing. Itâ€™s very helpful. I wish I would have sprung for the one that is WiFi compatible as well however. That way I could monitor it even when not at home. So far have had no issues while away though, but you never know."
60118,"Thanks for the recommendation! It seems like a lot of people have qualms with the chest style, I'll consider the stand-up"
60119,Upright freezer over a chest freezer any day. I've had both and chest is a pain to find things on the bottom.
60120,Upright tends to have the edge on efficiency - and more efficiency means greater longevity.
60121,Uprights are less efficient. Every time you open the door all the cold pours out. A chest keeps the cold in.
60122,Any recommendations on the brand?
60123,Just ran out and checked cuz it's in the attached garage. Bought in 2000 brand new. Frigidaire brand. Love it and really helps our food bill.
60124,"Larger commercial freezers aren't happy unless they have stuff in them, and they're huge and noisy (and will sometimes require repair anyway.) Buy consumer stuff. 

I've seen store brand (Frigidaire and the like) chest freezers last ten or more years in a cool basement."
60125,"Electrolux owns almost all the sub brands that make chest freezers, so no matter what you buy you're very likely to get the same model of an Electrolux freezer. After a lot of research I figured this out, and I read the same sorts of reviews when I was shopping for a chest freezer 3 years ago and had the same thoughts. Based on everything I read, I did 3 things:

1) Stalked Lowe's / Home Depot for clearance and / or scratch and ding chest freezers. If I was getting the same model no matter what I bought, I was going to find the cheapest price.

2) Found one, bought that store's 5 year extended warranty. It was $50 on a $400 freezer and covered everything, even the food inside if it spoiled because the freezer broke.

3) Bought 4 patio bricks and placed the freezer in my garage on the bricks, not directly on the floor. Many of the bad reviews mentioned rust on the bottom and I figured having it off the ground where water could condense / pool more easily might help. So far, no rust.

Finally, I keep a water bottle that I pre-froze with half the bottle filled with water in the freezer, but laying on it's side. So the water is stuck to the bottom even if it lays on its side. If the freezer ever fails for an extended period of time when I don't notice (like a power outage) when I'm not around, the water will melt and pool on the side of the bottle, and then refreeze that way if it was a power outage. It's super reliable and less expensive than a $50 wireless thermometer that might fail on its own anyway."
60126,That water bottle thing is brilliant
60127,You can also put a coin on the top of ice inside a small tupperware so the coin will sink to the bottom once the ice melts
60128,"Witches float, so I'd just put one in the bottom of an ice cube and if she rises to the top the ice must have melted."
60129,"[deleted]

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/67652)"
60130,"<and they're a bit easier to come by

But arguably meaner."
60131,What's the point of the water bottle thing? Just so you know if the power went out?
60132,"Yeah, don't want to accidentally eat spoiled food if the power went out for say, 2 days, then came back on and refroze the food. But it would also let me know if the freezer is sporadically working or not maintaining temperature below freezing consistently."
60133,What's interesting is that if the chest freezer is closed and the power is cut off; you're gonna need more than 2 days to defrost all the meat. Providing they've been frozen frozen
60134,What about frozen frozen frozen?
60135,No. Only two!
60136,I agree.  Great movie.
60137,"Frozen frozen is like rape rape, right?   If it's not *frozen* frozen, I believe it would be something else."
60139,"...except for post-2000 vacuums sold in North America, which are no longer made by [Aerus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerus), and therefore, just plain suck. 

Basically, if it doesnâ€™t look like your grandma's [cannister vacuum](http://www.vacuumland.org/TD/JPEG/MODERN/2014/dysonman1++3-12-2014-15-55-55.jpg), it's not the Electrolux you think it is."
60140,"> but laying on it's side. 

on its* side

    it's = it is"
60141,Do a search on commercial chest freezer. Much more expensive.
60142,"Thanks for the suggestion. I actually found one that isn't that much more expensive: http://www.centralrestaurant.com/Arctic-Air-AF-23-Reach-In-Freezer-One-Door-230-Cu-Ft-5-frasl-8-HP-c94p27184.html

I still have quite a bit more research to do, but this is a great lead for me. I've been really frustrated by the planned obsolescence of pretty much every residential freezer I've looked at."
60143,"My smallish, $100 scratch 'n dent GE has held up pretty well the last three years!"
60144,Which country are you in?
60145,Cryo-Cuff [makes something](http://www.sourceortho.net/cryo-cuff-ic-motorized-cooler-w-shoulder-cuff/) that freezes your chest really well.
60146,"Not sure if joke or mistake, but that brand worked great for my mom after surgery."
60147,"I have an old Roper that is still kicking, love that thing. Idk if they still make them or if they have gone cheap though"
60148,Appliance reviews on websites are garbage. For one thing model numbers change so often it's very unlikely that half of the reviews you are reading are from users of the exact same model you're looking at.
60150,Neat-o-reeno!
60151,"If money is not a concern, Thermo and Kaltis make laboratory-grade chest freezers designed to last a lifetime. Costs around 20 grand though.

https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/720CV?ICID=search-product

http://www.betatekinc.com/pdf/kaltis_catalogue.pdf"
60152,"The chances of me buying a $20k item from this board is slim. However, something in me likes being aware of those items. I do wonder if you can talk to a commercial refrigeration outfit. Some of them do custom work."
60153,"I don't have a thermo-fisher freezer either, but I do buy a lot of Duran glassware and Nalgene plastic containers through my lab. Those tough buggers are designed to withstand extreme temperatures and centrifugal forces, so they're probably as close to BIFL as you can get."
60154,"When I wanted something glass for making cold brew coffee, I ended up getting Pyrex Erlenmeyer flasks and brewer's corks"
60155,Just be sure to get a frost free one.
60156,"Ok, well, no one's saying anything, so I'll say it. Frost free ones are slightly more complex and on that basis, might be more likely to fail. They will also dry your food out faster because in order to stay frost-free, they need to fluctuate the temperature so that any frost accumulated on the walls can melt.

Basically, to save on electricity and effort, get yourself a non-frost-free (frosty or frost-filled?) chest freezer with a drain plug *near the bottom* (some have them higher up so you have to tilt the damned thing to get all the water out) Make sure you can attach a hose to it. On winter days, you just take the food outside and let the freezer drain into a drain or a bucket.


Edit: Also make sure the baskets are not made of plastic. Some manufacturers still havenâ€™t clued in to the fact that plastic gets brittle in the cold.  I'd rather have something hint at me that I'm about to break it and temporarily bend a little than snap and permanently break after I've overloaded it."
60157,I have bears near me.  Sitting my meats outside for extended periods would probably be a bad idea.
60158,"Unless your not wrapping your food, you'll be fine. It's frozen and preferably wrapped properly."
60159,"Hah, I didn't say ""for an extended period of time"", to leave it unattended, to leave it unsecured out in the open, or to let the frost in the chest freezer melt without the aide of a hairdryer or bucket of hot water.

I'm imagining you laying all your stuff on the front lawn for several hours while it gets dark out and the water trickles out of your freezer one drop at a time."
60160,"Still. It's frozen, so you might be able to get a cooler or a few coolers for when that happens. I would say to wait until the freezer is empty, but most people I know with a 2nd freezer never have it empty"
60161,True Freezers
60162,"HVAC guy here.

Any chest freezer/cooler you get will last exponentially longer if you occasionally clean the condenser coil on the back. Turning it off and using a soft brush will be good enough, just keep it from plugging with dust/lint.

The biggest brands I see at work are IDW and True, but they may not be available at a consumer or residential scale"
60163,"Cool Iâ€™ll keep that in mind. Iâ€™m guessing the environment itâ€™s in affects it, but if itâ€™s just inside in a basement, would once a year or once every six months make sense? More often?"
60164,"I just bought a chest freezer for $150 (scratch&amp; dent) from best buy. It is their insignia in-house brand 10.2cuft. no coil on the back Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

So nothing for me to clean? 

I figure just keep the seal and mating surface clean, and keep the frost level down."
60166,"I would also like to know the best brands, specifically in Canada."
60167,I found [this](https://consumersane.com/most-reliable-refrigerator-brand/) in another thread that helped a lot. Iâ€™m probably going to get a whirlpool. Thereâ€™s a factory only an hour or so from me where they make these so Iâ€™ll bet theyâ€™re the best option for you too.
60168,"Do not get a Samsung fridge! My ice maker is constantly malfunctioning and needs constant maintenance. The Samsung dishwasher in our new house was so stupidly designed, that it was impossible to clean and therefore extremely moldy and smelly. Samsung only for TVs."
60169,My experience exactly.
60170,Thank you !
60171,How old is your Samsung fridge? Iâ€™ve had mine for roughly 4 years and never had a single problem with it. It is a French door style with door in door and ice maker and water dispenser in the door.
60172,My Samsung sounds like your model. I got 8 years out of it.  Then the repair guy (a friend actually) scorned me for even buying a Samsung.
60173,I didnâ€™t know about all the issues that they had until a couple of years ago. But I have never once experienced a single issue.
60174,"Yours is 4 years old!

Fridges should last at least 10-15 years. If not 25.

Check back with us in 5 years."
60175,"Well based on what everyone says about the ice makers having tons of issues, not even had one instance of that."
60176,Trust me I am rooting for your success. But mine worked perfectly for 7 and a half years.  Then it froze over. And died.
60177,Crossing my fingers then
60178,"9 years on mine, it froze over pretty bad but we caught it and thawed it out and added the bigger drain clip on the heating element before the ice ate up the evaporator fan.  Same that the local appliance shop told me ""good luck finding someone that can fix a Samsung"" last time I was browsing there for a washer and dryer and mentioned my Samsung fridge."
60179,What happens with the icemaker?
60181,"I'm an appliance tech, and i can echo some of the same sentiments: avoid Samsung, LG, Kenmore, GE and Frigidaire like the plague. JennAir, Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Amana, and Maytag is the way to go"
60182,thank you !
60183,"Fwiw, he only gave you one brand really; all of those are owned by Whirlpool."
60184,Noted ! Thank you
60185,"would you recommend to stay away from all LG fridges? or are there some that are ""ok"" . 
Totally agree with avoiding Samsung fridges though"
60186,"Avoid Samsung, LG, Kenmore, GE, and Bosch. 

Kitchenaid, Whilpool or Frigidaire are better quality, they may not be as flashy as some other brands but you'll want a unit that last over it looking fancy."
60187,Kenmore refrigerators with model numbers beginning with 106 are made by whirlpool and ones that begin with 253 are Frigidaire. Kenmore doesnâ€™t make anything.
60188,LG also uses the kenmore name
60189,"Yes. Those begin with 795. GE(464)Maytag, Samsung, amana, and daewoo(110) as well. Canâ€™t remember all of the model numbers. Worked for Sears home services for quite a few years."
60190,Kenmore isnâ€™t an innately bad purchase if you know what youâ€™re looking for
60191,"Kitchenaid and whirlpool are worse than GE I would argue, other than the GE profile. With most other brands I see consistent failures (drain lines and ice makers with Samsung, fans with GE, Compressors with LG) with Kitchenaid/Whirlpool it seems like a crapshoot. There's a 5k fridge out there that I've done everything to and they are less than 3 years old. Evap fan failures, cut harness on the deli drawer, LED's going out, control board failures, deli drawer board under the water dispenser frying, bad seal on the augur motor, drain lines, freon leaks, etc.

Their disassembly is so much worse than any other brand too. 

Frigidaire is probably the only fridge I'd risk buying right now"
60192,">drain lines and ice makers with Samsung

Just did the iced over drain fix on my 9 year old Samsung this weekend.  So many rusted out parts behind the panel.  Is it worth replacing the rusty metal plates or the whole panel and evap coil assemblies or should we just say our prayers it doesn't freeze up again and go shopping now?  Was hoping it would last until selling the house in the next year or so, but no spare fridge means we can't go without if it completely craps out."
60193,Which Frigidaire refrigerator would you recommend?
60194,"Thank you, we have ZERO interest in ""fancy"".
Large Capacity(26+) and efficient use of freezer space"
60195,"French door refrigerators have more space but also come with more issues 

Side by side refrigerators are a little more reliable in the long run.  

I work in the sales and service industry for appliances. 

Most units of any brand have a life expectancy of about 5 years before something major fails, my experience has seen most of the avoid brands I mentioned failed at a higher rate and earlier than expected."
60196,My 9 years old GE Cafe fridge still running.  Had to replace the motherboard once but that's OK.

60198,Ge cafe series is good.  I am not happy w my Electrolux hybrid oven
60199,"I prefer to stick with major American brands because parts are readily available. I've heard with LG and Samsung it can be hard to get parts or they're expensive; either way you will almost always have to wait for shipping; Where as there are GE parts stores all over the place. I've done a few DIY repairs on Whirlpool and GE refrigerators (from YouTube instructions), and they were all pretty easy. It's probably best to get the most popular models, so the parts will likely be more widely distributed."
60200,Be aware GE appliances are no longer an American brand they are owned by and built by the Chinese company Haier and the product quality has shown that.
60201,"Many of their appliances, including many of their refrigerators, are still built in the US including in Louisville, KY. They also still do much of the engineering there. The same people that designed and built their appliances before the company changed hands still do."
60202,Was going to say the same. They bought the appliance division of GE but otherwise didn't change anything in North America regarding design and production. Been one of the most reliable brands for refrigeration for us.
60203,Keep an eye out for Hotpoint and some GE. I've noticed the same manufacturing quality getting shifted over and anything with the R600 compressor is having catastrophic failures.
60204,"Will do, we haven't had any yet but we may be lucky. Feedback from techline has been watch anything not  out of the Mexico factory in regards to refrigeration. I guess they've had a greater than normal failure rate."
60205,"For some reason I've been getting tons. I just call GE, report the model and since they don't make parts for them they just offer a new one. Midea makes some of the hotpoints and I'm seeing Midea standup freezers with the GE label now and the chest freezers are going out at an alarming rate too."
60206,"I have seen the uprights and chest, thankfully nothing significant. Our GE rep is pretty on point so it's kept the headaches to a minimum. This third party bs is a killer, we picked up some Whirlpool subsidiaries and parts availability is comical. GE has been no better."
60207,"Iâ€™ve been seeing Midea stuff pop up all over the place under many names, even Lennox mini-splits.

It does also seem that quality in the industry in general is at a low. Perhaps as they are rushing to catch up with demand for new equipment?"

60213,"CR recommended this [one](http://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-10-6-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-FCM11PHWW/205443672)

I linked to Home Depot because a quick google search showed they had the lowest price.

If you can find an old Sears Coldspot freezer, it'd be worth looking into.  I bought one in 2005 that was made in the late 60's and its still running strong.  Sears Coldspot freezers became Kenmore around 1977.

Edit to add:  I live just south of Memphis, TN and the freezer stays in my garage so its seen the heat and humidity of the South all its life and is still kicking."
60214,"> heat and humidity of the South all its life and is still kicking.

   
I am close to Memphis also and I work there - holy hell the heat and humidity here are *horrible* - came here to look for a suggestion for a deep freezer because we need one that will hold up in our garage :) Thanks!"
60215,"Having a freezer in a hot area will always make it work harder for two reasons.  The first is that it's simply hotter so the inside warms up faster.  The second is that the efficiency of all cooling devices decreases the hotter the ""exhaust"" temperature is.  This means that as it gets hotter outside each unit of cooling will take longer to achieve. 

 I'm not sure there is such a thing as a definitive bifl chest freezer on the market today because they can all have compressor issues.  My freezer strategy is to just buy the cheap small chest freezers from lowes and replace them as needed.  I have two of them and the oldest has been running fine for 5 or 6 years.  The newest is only a few months old.  I haven't had one fail yet.

You also need to manually defrost it maybe once or twice a year or that makes it work harder because the frost acts as an insulator and keeps the cooling tubes from doing their job."
60216,">You also need to manually defrost it maybe once or twice a year

That seems way more often than I find I need to defrost mine. Might depend on multiple factors."
60217,"Yeah I just defrost mine when I'm low on meat and before I get half a pig or go on a fishing trip.  That happems to be once or twice a year.  I also just don't like the frost.  I think the more you open it and the more humid it is, the more frost builds up."
60218,"Right, mine is massive and I hate the process of defrosting. It must be pushing 15-20 years old now, I should really look into how efficient it is compared to new models at some point."
60219,"Did the same thing when we downsized to a condo a couple years ago. Added a mid size upright Frigidaire freezer in garage.  FYI [not all freezers will work well in garage and/or lower temperatures](http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/freezer-in-garage.html). Frigidaire was only brand recommended for garage use.   Misc comments:  My buddy found a used commercial freezer from a store closing on CL for his garage, works great.  A chest freezer is more efficient than upright, it's lowest cost selection. Auto defrost feature will add to monthly cost but reduces cleaning/maint."
60220,"Honestly I would try to find an older one online. I'm a refrigeration/hvac tech and I have worked on a few very high end fridges. They aren't made like they used to, same with hvac equipment. Sub zero fridges which are around 8000 bucks aren't built any stronger then a cheap one as far as the mechanics. Same compressor same evap/condenser. The old deep freezers were built alot thicker/stronger."
60221,"I don't think there is some elite brand of freezer you're going to get. My advice is to find one on craigslist. They are robust. 

I would highly suggest a temp alarm on it. I've had a door left slightly ajar cost me a lot of $$$ in meat before, the same could happen if your freezer malfunctioned. 

Frost free are less efficient and are more prone to failure."
60222,"I think they are worth it.  But I would strongly recommend to buy it brand new and *not* used.  This is because the newer models are energy star compliant and every year they make more energy efficient models.  If you buy used, you will probably be buying someone else's headaches and have a higher electric bill.

Chest freezers hold more and have a lower profile and so can be put underneath cellar stairs and in other places that have otherwise unusable space.

The down side is that they can quickly become an open sewer of leftovers with freezer ziplock bags cast asunder and every which way with some plummeting to the very bottom of the chest where you will never see it again.  

If you put in any type of organizational partitions, those eat up room, but you can find your stuff quicker and more easily.

The other downside is that it has this nice flat lid on it that is a magnet for stuff to be put on that empty space.  Then, you have to clear it off every time you want to get into it.  

I have a chest freezer and despite the downsides, I like it.  I like the smaller footprint, the increased storage space and the fact that if I slightly overload it and the lid pops up, I can simply put a paint can on the lid to hold it down.  

Also, you don't have to worry too much about these when the power goes out since they are full of frozen items.  As long as you don't open it up, your stuff will pretty much stay somewhat frozen if the power is out for less than 24 hours.

Since you are vegetarians, you might be better served with a pressure canner -- they are slightly cheaper than chest freezers and you are not paying electricity to freeze/chill/maintain your garden produce or even cooked meals.

I will pressure can my chicken stock, tomatoes, green beans etc. and save my freezer for my raw meat that I buy in bulk. If you eat lots of frozen vegetables versus growing your own, then perhaps the chest freezer would be the way to go.

Oh! and congratulations on the upcoming nuptials! My best wishes to you both!"
60223,"Wait, I'm able to can chicken stock?  Awesome!"
60224,"Yesiree -- boil the stock first then put into jars and then into your pressure canner.  If you have no solids in the stock, then it's 30 minutes per pint at 10lbs pressure and 35 minutes per quart at 10lbs pressure.

If you make chicken soup with solids in it, then it's 50 minutes per pint and 55 minutes per quart.  But I find it's better to can the stock and then make the soup with it using fresh vegetables.  

That's all there is to it.  

The ""secret"" is to buy the largest pressure canner you can afford and make a whole bunch of stock.  You can stack the jars one on top of each other in the canner using racks.  

Use your canned stock within the year.  Although, I have used stock that's two years old without a problem but do as I say, not as I do."
60225,Getting ready to can my first big batch when we cull chickens this year.  I'll have at least 15 birds that will become dinner.  What is your stock recipe?  FWIW I have a 30qt pressure cooker.
60226,">What is your stock recipe?

Nothing too out of the ordinary -- I chuck in carrots, celery, fist full of parsley, fist full of thyme sprigs, cut an onion or two in half and chuck that in unpeeled (you're going to strain all this stuff out anyway, so I leave all the peels on), some unpeeled garlic cloves and bay leaves.  I add a little salt (not too much because I'll salt it when I get around to opening up the can and using it), and some unground peppercorns.

If I'm feeling adventurous I might add a few whole cloves, but only when I remember.

I'll pull out all my necks, wings and backs out of the freezer and add them and maybe a couple of small birds (I raise chickens and ducks too) or perhaps a duck that is too small to roast on it's own.  I'll boil this away for several hours until it gets nice and concentrated.  I'll pull out the whole birds and pick over the carcasses and use the meat for chicken salad or for soup.  The duck meat makes an especially tasty ""chicken"" salad."
60227,"Awesome, thanks for the tips.  I've made my share of chicken soup before, but never in such large bulk amounts for the purpose of canning.  I do have 1 duck, but she's a pet.  That girl is safe from the pot.  :)"
60228,"I forgot one other frugal tip -- if you make this in the winter time on a snow day, you can put the pot on top of the wood stove.  The simmering soup adds moisture to the air as you stoke the stove.  

I won't do the canning on the wood stove though because you need to have a consistent 10lbs of pressure so you don't get food poisoning."
60229,Alas no wood stove for me.  Thanks for the tip though!
60230,"You can buy ""newer"" ones that are energy star rated. We found ours at a Salvation Army thrift store. I think it was was maybe 2 years old."
60231,Do yourself a favor and buy one on craigslist. People are buying them new all the time and then deciding they don't have the space for one. We got a nearly-new 22 cubic foot upright freezer for $75 because a soccer mom wanted the basement space back.
60232,I bought one on craigslist and there was a dead whore in it
60233,So you're saying it was a good deal?
60234,"Cool story: I was working security for a big estate auction back last fall. Auction started at lunch but wasn't over until almost 1am. Not many people left at that point and they were wrapping up and alot of stuff was getting passed over because no one was bidding. The auctioneer wouldn't take any less than a $5.00 bid. Well this midsize chest freezer came up. She wasn't the prettiest girl at the ball with her slightly rusty top and a couple rust spots on side but she worked. NO ONE BID! They passed it over and moved on. I went straight to the office and got a bidder number and after fees I paid $6.15 for a chest freezer that has been working since last fall and has a TON of meat chillin' out inside.

EPIC WIN!"
60235,How else do you keep the side of beef or the whole pig?
60236,"I've had both chest freezer and an upright freezer and wouldn't go back to a chest freezer. 60% of the contents of the chest freezer served only to keep the most frequently accessed items at a reachable level.

I would also not recommend a frost free freezer. A frost free freezer uses more energy and freezer burns food more quickly. You have to be more careful to keep the door properly closed with a frost freezer (use the lock). Even the smallest air gap on the seal will cause frost to form on the interior. You don't have to do a full defrost to keep the frost down. Whenever the frost seems to be building up I unload a shelf into a laundry basket with a towel on top or picnic cooler and scrape off the frost with a plastic spatula. The door is open for only a minute or two max and nothing gets much time to defrost. I haven't fully defrosted the freezer in 8 years. Another tip-- do your ""defrosting"" in the winter time and just unload all the food into laundry baskets and put it outside in the cold."
60237,"I love mine.  Good for stuff out of your garden, freezing day old bread, sides of beef, etc."
60238,Do you have a chest freezer or an upright?
60239,"I've been using both types for many years. 

An upright, be it frost free or not has only one advantage over a chest freezer, and that is the ability to easily see and reach everything that is in it. The upright freezer has a big flaw though, and that is that with all the shelves and their brackets, and ""compartments"" protruding from the inside of the door, you will find that a ton of the volume, (maybe a third) is geometrically unusable. So the practical usefulness of a 15 cubic foot freezer might approach 10 cubic feet.

While being frost free saves a once or twice a year job, those type freezers are as dry as a desert, and anything you store in there that isn't well vacuum sealed in heavy plastic, (think the packaging on bacon) will dry out and get freezer burn. No other packaging method that you can do on your counter will be safe from this.

The biggest problem that a chest freezer has is the tendency of things to accumulate on the bottom where they are a pain in the butt to reach. You prevent this by storing things in shallow boxes or tupperware type boxes that you stand on edge in the bottom layer of the freezer. This means that you never have to reach further than halfway in to the freezer to remove something.

Defrosting a chest freezer is not the chore it's made out to be. You can do it very passively by removing the contents to a table, stacking things compactly, and covering the whole thing with a couple blankets or a quilt. In the couple of hours that your freezer then sits with the power off and the lid open, softening the ice, those items under the quilt will survive. Things don't defrost that quickly. After a couple of hours of the freezer being open, the ice will be soft enough that a butter knife will pry it free in big sheets, and  you gather it off the bottom with a dust pan or a piece of cardboard.

I never do it passively though. After I make my pile of goods under the quilt, I attack the ice with a hair dryer. It only takes about ten minutes to soften the ice enough to pry it loose with the butter knife, (a butter knife won't poke any holes in the metal sides of the freezer wall, so don't be chicken) then repack and and restart. It's not an all day job by any means.

Lots of chest freezers come with a defrosting ""heater element"" built into the walls. There will be a button, usually on the underside of the lid, or near a top corner of the freezer wall that you pull out, that quickly warms the wall of the freezer enough to coax the ice off in big pieces. This works as quickly as my hair dryer method. 

Chest freezers also have the advantage of being extremely simple machines, and with no moving parts can be expected to work for a couple of generations.

Oh, and if you have kids and an upright freezer, you can be sure that a couple times a year you are going to find that someone left the freezer door open."
60240,A chest freezer.
60241,Can you save about 10 bucks worth of food in it a month to be worth it?
60242,"I honestly don't know. It's possible that the kind of sales I would stock up on happen often enough that I wouldn't need to buy in huge quantities.  Then again, I wouldn't have to go to the store as often, or spend my time searching for coupons and sales every week."
60243,"Food prices are rising, and are not set to decline for quite some time.  Think of having a chest freezer as a slight hedge against rising costs."
60244,"I wouldn't want a self-defrosting freezer. They use more energy, and food doesn't keep as well with the periodic warming. Also they're more complex, which means more things to go wrong."
60245,"But with a manual defrost, doesn't it start using more electricity as the ice builds up? Does that mean I have to use up the contents or empty them out once a year (or more)?"
60246,"Yes, the ice buildup will reduce efficiency, and you will have to empty it for the manual defrost. I would do it once a year on a really cold day and put the stuff outside to stay frozen. If you live in a humid area, the ice might build up so fast that you'd have to defrost more than once a year.

It's definitely a trade-off. Manual defrost takes more work, but if you don't mind the work, you can store things longer for cheaper."
60247,"We live in Florida, so really cold days are hard to come by and humidity abounds.  We don't have a basement (Florida) so it will be kept in a garage."
60248,"In that case, self-defrost is a reasonable option, and I think there are some self-defrosting chest fridges now. Still, anything kept in it for more than a few months is going to get freezer burn from repeated surface thawing."
60249,"If you consider how quickly non-frozen food can go bad, it's well worth the cost. It's also good for left-overs. Just make sure you get a size that makes sense. They sell smaller ones for under $200, which I think is good for small families."
60250,"If you have the space, it wouldn't be a bad purchase.  I'd figure around $3 month on electricity.  Our freezer is currently at the brim like yours, but I don't have anywhere to put a freezer so we continue to make do."
60251,We bought half a cow a while back. Chucked in in the chest freezer. Paid itself off pretty quickly (more efficient than an upright too).
60252,"Self-defrosting is pointless when you can just open the lid for a day and then drain it of water.

BTW if it is building ice there is something wrong (air leak).

I had a 1/2 chest freezer and it would fill to the brim with our garden harvest (blanched caul/brocc/zucc, etc etc)"
60253,"I use an upright that I keep in the garage.  A chest freezer can be pretty hard on your back if you're dealing with several pounds of frozen goods at shin level.

I suggest looking for a ""scratch and dent"" model.  You can normally get a new freezer with a little bit of shipping damage and save 10-20%."
60254,"Get two and convert one into a fridge! Use baskets to organize them. WAY cheaper to run than the upright kind and readily available on craigslist.

60258,"I wanted a chest freezer due to the higher efficiency, but the wife wanted a stand up so things would be neat and organized with the shelves.  So we compromised and got the stand up.  Lol."
60259,"I thought about getting a chest freezer, i can't imagine using one after i saw my sister digging around in hers for what she was looking for. 

We are saving up for a stand up freezer. For some reason the same technology standing up with a few cheap wire shelves costs a lot more."
60260,"Definitely recommend the stand-up variety. We had a chest freezer and got rid of it because it was full but I never knew what was in it and getting to anything was always a pain in the behind. 

Enter upright freezer and I'm a happy camper.  Labeled and easy to access means that we use it effectively and nothing gets wasted."
60261,"Yes, this event has opened my eyes to how much better off we *could* be.

I've got it down on my list after all this to go out and buy one."
60262,"I wrote about this in another thread posted on preppers but can't find it. SO TLDR from that

Focus on purchasing a 7 Foot freezer if you can. Affordability wise it's the best bang for your buck. 7 Foot freezers should be about 200-300, the ones I saw on amazon and best buy were 229.   
I purchased 1 of the last 5 foot chest freezers in my area around a month or 2 months ago at my home depot. which could go anywhere around 150-250.   
People weren't discussing it here but it was a hot commodity people were buying in silence.

The brands that I saw had the highest rating were Insignia, midea and magic chef. But wherever you do purchase it, just read the majority of reviews, assuming the chest freezers are even still available. Try to get one that has a 1 year warranty (Most do). Good luck."
60263,thanks but i don't think i can lift that alone. need something i can lift solo
60264,have it delivered? or grab a friend. The person at the homedepot loaded it into my car  himself. 5 foot one just took me and my brother. 7 foot one wouldn't be that much heavier imo.
60265,"My partner hemmed and hawed about getting one (I said we're probably okay either way) and by the time he decided to get one they were all gone at Costco.

Turns out the in-laws have a 9 cu ft they aren't using. But it's a bit big for our space and they're 2 hrs away. We'll see.

I've hear chest freezers are better than uprights.  A midsize would probably be best."
60266,"I'm so thankful that my wife nagged me about getting a freezer for her breastmilk until I gave in.  We have a 10.6 cu ft GE chest freezer, and it's now about 3/4 full with frozen vegetables, chicken, and steaks.  I wouldn't go with any thing smaller than 5 cu ft because you'll probably fill it fast once you realize you have all that capacity."
60267,"I'd go slightly bigger if you have the space in your house/apartment/bunker/etc- chest freezers can be super useful to store other foods you get on sale like meat or fish or frozen pizza or ice cream or basically anything that you eat often that occasionally is on sale for far less than the average price.  I've never said ""I wish my freezer was smaller.""  I have a small household and a 15 ish cubic foot freezer, but that's likely more than you need unless you're a weirdo like me who does a lot of freezer cooking and bulk buys.

In my area 3.5 cu foot freezer are in the low $200 range and 7.0 are in the high $200 range, to me upsizing would be reasonable if you're not crunched for space."
60268,"My country ((Ireland they are completely sold out).
So if you're lucky enough to have a choice, make it fast."
60269,"It'll be almost impossible to find a chest freezer that will last you for life at this time.  Almost all consumer chest freezers from the major manufacturers (Frigidaire and GE are the big names in the game right now) are made at the same factory in China.  You can expect about 10 years of service from them on the high side, 5 on the low.

It sucks, but unless you look commercial, you'll have a tough time finding anything consumer line that will fit the bill.

Source: Sold appliances for a few years."
60270,Thanks. That's a bit disappointing to hear. At least now I know I can get whichever is cheapest.
60271,Is there an older model we should look for?
60272,"Honestly, just look for US made.  I know that sounds nationalistic, but they're all buying from a few manufacturers, and the US made models tend to be better in relation to their overall craftsmanship in terms of part quality and overall longevity.  

As another user said, avoid frost free; while it's a nice benefit to not have to thaw your freezer occasionally, it creates another point of failure and can cause issues with temperature variation.  Also, VACUUM YOUR FREEZER'S COILS AND ACCESSIBLE PARTS.  This will improve the longevity more than nearly anything else.  Oh, also, try to get one with a metal interior.  Many cheapos are made today with plastic linings that will crack over time."
60273,Any brand suggestions?
60274,"Only 5-10 years?  Is this a more recent phenomenon?  That is, if I have appliances made 10+ years ago, should I hold on to them due to suddenly shorter life-spans in recent years?"
60275,"Planned obsolescence is a thing, and since manufacturers are using fewer high quality components in increasingly complicated machines, you have a higher failure rate overall.

As far as holding onto appliances, probably not.  The energy efficiency of recent appliances can offset the cost of buying a new fridge every decade, but this definitely depends on the models you have, the models you buy, and how you take care of them."
60276,You could have just said you're not sure.  I just know that I've usually seen appliances last a LOT longer than 5-10 years but that was almost 20 years ago since I bought one.
60277,"I'm not unsure though.  All of my sales reps (GE, Frigidaire/Electrolux, Bosch/Thermador, Whirlpool/Amana/Maytag) stated that their lifecycle is ~7-10 years.  This is largely due to using lower quality parts, and more electronics which add to points of failure, lowering their life expectancy.

This doesn't mean that you're losing money by buying newer appliances that won't last as long.

For example, say you get an old fridge for $500 that lasts 20 years but costs $80/yr to run.  Over that period, you'll spend $1600 just on operating the unit, so $2100 over the life cycle of the unit.  If you get a newer fridge for $500 and it costs $45/yr to run, but it will only last you 10 years, you're spending $950 over the life of that unit.  To match the lifespan of the older fridge, you'll have to buy another one at $500, and spend an additional $450 over the next 10 years, giving you a total cost on the newer unit of $1900, saving you $200 over the 20 years.

As you said, you're talking about experiences you've had personally with units that are 20 years old.  I'm talking about hundreds of appliances I've sold, as well as the life cycle projections from the manufacturers, on units that are new.

Just because the statement isn't as clear as you'd like doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about."
60278,"I think it's kind of like basic fridges, all pretty similar. Get a vacuum sealer and don't get frost free."
60279,">Get a vacuum sealer 

Great idea, thanks. 

>and don't get frost free. 

Why not?"
60280,"They use more energy, and I *believe* the are less reliable, but you might want to look into that. Mine is not frost free and I never have any issues with frosty food, especially since I vacuum seal everything. Maybe once every few years I'll empty everything and do a complete defrost though as it can build up a bit over time."
60281,"Thanks. 

>They use more energy, and I *believe* the are less reliable

Either would be reason plenty for me."
60282,"Did I break a rule or something? 

Why is this getting downvoted? 

Edit: I'm pretty sure it was /u/jaharm. They posted a direct link to some pillows at the same time without any comments. That post received 12 upvotes in under an hour. A review of /u/jaharm's profile reveals they only post links (usually direct to a purchase page, but occasionally youtube videos) have never made a comment, and is less than a month old. 

I suspect they are a corporate shill, and are manipulating votes.

60283,"It happens on reddit quite frequently.  If you want reddit to care, just start spamming more reddit gold than they do.  Think of it as practicing to lobby in politics."
60284,"$200 is a good starting point because of the recent story of a $30 one used

Avantco has ones for $199-299 from webstaurantstore, and apparently it's commercial. I can't attest to whether it's good or not though"
60285,"You're either going to have to increase your price or expect it to die.  As others have said don't get the auto defrost and if you can commercial (true makes some nice ones) will last a lot longer.  You can also pull one from a house made in the 60s if you want...it'll be inefficient but last for a long time. 


 For what it's worth I spent 4k on a commercial kelvinator last month...has a beast of a motor and the seals are replaceable (whole thing is self serviceable and under warranty for 5 years).   Thing will probably outlast my house.


Bought an 800$ whirlpool a week later as well... still serviceable but not nearly as much as the kelvinator...i don't expect it to last nearly as long kind of wishing I'd have just spent more and got another all out nice one."
60286,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but two things:

1. Pretty much all chest freezers are made in the same factory in china by another company for each manufacture to brand. So blaming Frigidaire might not be valid, except for the way they handled it under warranty. 

2. All freezers are backordered - big time. There was a massive run on them a few weeks back and the inventory has gone to zero. Best place to find one is Facebook marketplace or craigslist as used. 

The best one to buy in upright is going to be a manual defrost one because there is less to fail. Requires maintenance defrosting but a frost free freezer has a whole defrost system that can fail and ruin your food."
60287,"I've been calling around and got lucky enough to find some local stores that can order me a freezer, I'll just have to wait a few weeks to a month for it to arrive, but that's fine. The stores said they were only doing in store pickup, but when I explained my situation they were very willing to help me and arrange for it to be purchased through them, delivered, and set up for me once it's available. So I'll be able to get it, which is great. I'll just have to wait a bit, but I'm okay with that. 

As for manual defrost VS automatic defrost, do you know of any upright manual defrost ones that are very reliable? My Frigidaire chest freezer that suddenly stopped working was a manual defrost. But apparently that model has caused the same issues for other people so maybe it's just a problem in that one model. I'm not picky about manual VS automatic defrost, as long as whatever upright freezer I get keeps working properly for a long time. But I have noticed that it seems like most of the uprights sold near me are automatic defrost, so my options on defrost method may be limited due to availability. But if I can find a manual defrost one that is very good, I'd definitely consider it. Do you know which brands or models for upright freezers are the best in terms of reliability?"
60288,"As far as brands I'd go with sub zero, but that's $$$$. I can't say any other brand is better than frigidaire other than sub zero. I assume you're in the US and if so, they may be pulling your leg on when they can get the freezer in, but good luck. As far as chest freezers, the inside skins are very thin and the lines the freon run through are right there. It is very likely that throwing a frozen package of meat caused a small leak... about as likely that it came leaking from the factory (small leaks can take months before you notice a loss of performance).

As for brands, I carry GE, Frigidaire, Beko, and Speed Queen. Don't think Beko has any freezers but Speed Queen definitely does not. I have yet to experience an issue on any I've sold."
60289,"I plan to get a upright freezer to replace my chest freezer, so do you know if the brands you mentioned make reliable upright freezers? I don't think I could afford a subzero, I really don't want to spend more than 800 dollars on a freezer."
60290,"while we don't have a chest freezer, we do have a small stand-alone freezer.

not necessarily in direct answer to your questions, since questions 1 and 2 seem to be pointed at the same answers:  

**Buy it when it's cheap:** yes, it saves us quite a lot of grocery money, because we can buy meats on sale w/o having to have them in the meal plan  Chicken thighs go on sale?  buy an extra package.  BBQ season means pork ribs and brisket are cheap? buy an extra package.

**prepared food:** 

* the freezer has also helped us out in giving us the ability to pre-cook meals and sit on them for a while.  we've had 'successful' days at the grocery stores, which leave us with a grip of food.  We will occasionally spend that night cooking 2 or 3 meals, and then dividing them up into serving sized tupperware and then throw them in the freezer for lunches and whatnot.  
* My wife also makes our own soup stocks (chicken, beef, pork, and seafood), and this wouldn't happen w/o the freezer.  We sit on chicken bones (generally carcasses from whole roasted chickens) in the freezer until we have a lot, then those get boiled down, and the resultant stock gets frozen for later use.

**Lazy Days:**  don't want to cook?  pull a frozen pizza out of the freezer!  man.  this alone has saved us time and money enough to pay for the freezer (we did craigslist it, to provide a sense of scale though).  frozen pizza (and even wings) bought either at cost, or especially when they are on sale, easily comes in in at 1/5 the cost of ordering a pizza from the delivery shack.  

**cost of operating:**  Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe I'll leave a note for the wife and see if we can forensically look through the electric bill for some sense of scale, but I don't think it's crazy high because of the freezer.  I know it's not crazy high at all, and I don't think there's  a lot of influence on it from the freezer alone.  We do keep it in the garage however, and we are in Tejas, so it does run somewhat hard.  (luckily, it's on a shaded, fairly cool, side of the house).

**maintenance:** I'll say this too, is that freezers can be fairly easy to repair and troubleshoot.  I fixed mine when it broke once, and while it took a bit for me to get off my lazy ass to do it, it probably only took a total time of 2 hours to research, dis-assemble, meter-out, order, and re-assemble the broken temp sensor.  for $20.  well worth it.  My point here is that while new is good, and you get the warranty (Shopping by warranty is a *huge* criteria of mine when purchasing appliances, tools, and things that get used heavily.  A 'lifetime Warranty' is often worth the price and the peace of mind), don't be afraid of craigslisting a working one and being prepared to fix it when the time comes.  

Anyhow, that's what I've got.  Good Luck!"
60291,Thank you so much for your well-thought-out reply!
60293,"The plastic bins don't get brittle and break? I've got fabric bins in mine (after searching, unsuccessfully, for wire bins), and I've been looking for a different option lately."
60294,No brittle problem with the ones I have.
60295,"I found that it was too difficult to find the items I needed in a large freezer.  It was full for only a short period of time and then space was wasted.  I switched to a smaller one and intended to buy a second small freezer if I ran out of room.  My intention was to fill both freezers and then empty one and unplug it when they got half empty.  I never did run out of room with only one.  You just adjust your buying accordingly.  

If you have a large family and/or you are an organized person and can partitian off a larger freezer to simplify finding items than you may find a large freezer convenient but I found mine to be a pain."
60296,We have 3 people and our chest freezer is always full.  For OAMC it would  be essential.  We don't do OAMC but we do prepare large quantities for later consumption.
60297,"I have a 10 year old small chest freezer. I also have a meter that measures how much juice any appliance uses. I threw it on the chest freezer for 30 days. It used up 20 KWH. Since my cost around here is about .10 per KWH, that comes out to about $2.00 a month. I lose more than that in change out of my pocket every month. Have fun."
60298,!! an actual metric!  that's awesome!  What's is silly about your statement is that it reminds me of my kill-a-watt sitting right behind me.  I'm going to go plug that into the freezer right now!  Thanks!
60299,That's exactly the meter I used. I got my moneys worth out of that thing.
60300,"I am an out of sight, out of mind personality and that didn't suit me when I had a CHEST freezer-i would quite simply forget what i had, or something would get put on top of something else and get 'buried'. I didn't have the discipline to make a list or rotate stock frequently."
60301,Costco has one for 175 and its bigger than that one. find someone who has a card or buy a gift card for the amount and you can go and buy the freezer without a membership
60302,Great tip! Had no idea that you could go to costco without a membership if you bought a gift card.
60303,It will cost about $40-60 a year to operate depending on your electric rate.
60304,"7 ft3: $210 + $25/year in electricity. Assuming 10-year life, thatâ€™s $3.83/month. For a 20-year life, thatâ€™s $2.96/month.

15 ft3: $410 + ~$38/year in electricity. 10-year life: $6.58/month. 20-year life: $4.88/month.

25 ft3: $710 + ~$52/year in electricity. 10-year life: $10.25/month. 20-year life: $7.29/month."
60305,That's less than the amount I'd be saving on meat. Woohoo!
60306,"At my old apartment, all basic utilities, electricity, water, hot water was a part of the rent bill. And it was still the cheapest place in the city!"
60307,Why would you give up a sweet apt like that?
60308,"Because my in laws made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Their home has a downstairs suite with a kitchen, bedroom, living room and two bathrooms; basically everything I had before but in a MUCH nicer part of town and 200 dollars less. And yes all basic utilities included as well.

The only downside is about 60 min round trip each day of commuting, which I am more than happy do to because it saves money and keeps money in the family."
60309,Lucky you!!!!
60310,"...do they want to adopt an extra adult child? If so, I will submit a resume. I'd make a great little sister, I promise. :P 

Seriously, cool fucking parents. Your family is awesome."
60311,"I definitely save a lot of money on groceries with my chest freezer. I rarely buy meat unless it is on sale. When I do find a good deal I stock up. 

I also get a lot of free food! In hunting season, and after butchering livestock, friends and relatives give us meat that they've run out of room for and we get often get excess from their gardens too. They don't want the food to go to waste and they know we'll put it in our freezer and happily eat it. 

It is also nice to keep a stockpile of frozen fruit and veggies so we can make smoothies rather than go to the store for ice cream when we get a sweet craving or have veggies on hand when we haven't been able to make it to the grocery store for a few days. 

The extra room is also really nice for meal planning. I can save ham bones for split pea soup or make extra large batches of soup, sauces, pulled pork, etc. and freeze the leftovers for nights when there just isn't time or motivation to cook... and I still have room for ice trays in my regular freezer! 

As for the electric bill, I really have not noticed any change in cost. The amount of electricity used is so small it isn't really noticeable."
60313,"Before you buy new, check out Craigslist.  That's where we bought our ""beer fridge"" for the garage and our chest freezer.  Both were cleaned up and have worked well for the last four years.  I think we paid $100 for the fridge and $150 for the freezer.  

By the way, someone mentions items getting lost under others and going out of date.  We solve this in two ways.  First, I use baskets to keep like items together and second we got a magnetic dry erase board that you'd usually use on the fridge and I use it to keep track of what I have and when it went in."
60314,"Yes! We buy a whole side of beef every year and split it with my brother. Comes out to about $2 a pound, which is a lot for ground beef but very cheap for porterhouse, so I think it averages out. 

Also, see if the butcher will break it down for you into at least smaller cuts."
60315,The producer we're buying from will cut and wrap and deliver. It's great!
60316,"Hey, just a reminder: squeeze out as much air as you can if you store meat in ziplock bags. Squeezing out the air reduces the chance for freezer burn.

Source: growing up we always bought meat in bulk."
60317,"I'm a huge fan of freezer paper over bags. It's cheaper, I've never had an issue with freezer burn, and it holds its shape better so I can stack items more easily. It can be a bit messier when it comes time to thaw, but I just put a plate under the package and have no problem. Rather than freezer tape, I just use regular masking tape to close the packages."
60318,"I have a better way. I wrap my meat in Saran Wrap. Very, very tightly so all the air is out. No freezer burn. Then I throw a piece of aluminum foil over that. Works like a charm."
60319,Go for it. I put off getting one for years but finally pulled the trigger at the start of this year. It is so nice to have a place to put on sale meat and vegetables. My power bill did not seem that adversely effected.
60320,"Unless you keep track of every item that you have in there and their expiration dates, you're going to end up wasting a lot of money. My mom *hates* our chest freezer for this reason. Sometimes they are so deep, that the item at the very bottom you'll only see once: when you first place it in there. If you have only large items then this won't be a problem, but for smaller items, it's more than likely going to be very difficult to not have a lot of wasted food at the end of the day."
60321,"I'm single and have no use for another freezer. My freezer (part of my fridge) holds enough for one person. Besides I eat a lot of Greek yogurt and that's where I get at least 40% of my protein. 

When I did have a chest freezer when I was married I found we lost a lot of items to freezer burn because we would forget about them, and they'd get lost in the bottom. A chest freezer just didn't work for us. 
A smaller freezer allows me to find stuff easily, and lose less food."
