35381,Vodka Collins with a twist of lime.
36340,Screwdriver
35383,"Pink Panty Droppers. Dump a bag of ice, 24 Lite beers, a 5th of vodka, and some pink lemonade mix into a Gatorade cooler. It just tastes like slightly fizzy pink lemonade. You can't really taste the beer or the vodka. A batch of these things will kick a party into overdrive."
35384,"My personal favourite, long Island iced tea, definitely fits the bill. Make sure you use sugar syrup instead off adding granulated sugar like some degenerate recipe makers would have. 

1 part vodka
1 part white rum
1 part tequila 
1 part cointreau
1 part gin
1 part sugar syrup
1 part lemon juice 

Mix in shaker. Half fill a highball glass with ice, fill half way with cola and gently top it up with the deadly mix of spirits. It'll look like a haribo cola bottle if done correctly. 

Enjoy üòä"
35385,Thank you so much for the recipe! üíû
35386,As people say here: Vodka. Try it with some pineapple juice and sparkling water. You can put more than a shot in and taste almost nothing
35387,Your favorite vodkas to mix in drinks?
35388,"I‚Äôve heard Everclear is virtually tasteless in mixed drinks, but it‚Äôll also wreck you if you‚Äôre not careful"
35389,All the best jungle juice/ party mix drink I had in high school and college had Everclear in them
35390,I bought everclear for the first time the other day and I‚Äôm usually a rum/whiskey/scotch drinker... I was taken aback by how strong it was omg
35391,Am a student soo i dont got a really good look on it. But i find myself enjoying 'Eristoff' the most. It is somewhat soft and masks good in mixes. Way better than smirnoff atleast.
35392,Whisky sour on the rocks. Preferred whisky/bourbon + syrup + lemon juice + ice. Be careful when you stand up to use the bathroom!
35393,"It's crazy sweet, but refreshing on a beach.

Pineapple Juice and Malibu, shake it up and serve. Mix to your liking."
35394,"I like to add a shot of vodka to give it strenght. 

Love it!"
35395,"Gin Bucket- 1.75 L bottle of cheap gin. 2 2 Liter bottles of Sprite. 1 can each of frozen lemonade and limeade concentrate. 6 lemons and 6 limes sliced in rounds. Put everything into a large Styrofoam cooler and add a big bag of ice.Let it sit for a few hours before the party and essentially you'll have super refreshing alcoholic lemonade that has barely the slightest hint of the taste of gin. Seriously, everyone loves this stuff the first time they taste it. Cheers."
35396,Wouldn't the sprite go flat if you left it our for a few hours before you drink it?
35397,"Yes, but it's there more as a sweetener then a carbonator for the whole mix. Don't expect any bubbles"
35398,Tastes like college!
35399,I knew someone who had this with a bottle of Everclear in a paint can. You'll never guess what it was called.
35400,Neverclear?
35401,"Though Neverclear‚Äôs a better title, it was actually just called the Paint Can"
35402,"I‚Äôm intrigued, what was it called?"
35403,Probably paint thinner
35404,"All the bartenders and ‚Äúevolved‚Äù alcohol drinkers will crucify me for this buuuut...

Get two gallons of that nice apple cider. On the stove, boil some with like a cup or so of brown sugar, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a thinly sliced apple (I did circle slices for aesthetic, same way as an orange), circle orange slices, and some vanilla. Simmer it after it reaches a boil for quite awhile, your home should smell like a pie. 

Now you should have quite a bit of cider on the side, put that into a different container so the jars are empty. After you take your mixture off the heat and it has completely cooled, split it between the two gallon jars. 

Now split an entire ever clear bottle (I do 190 proof) between the two evenly. Also add a cup or so of spiced rum to each then top off with leftover cider. 

I always let this sit for a month or two just so the sugar really blends with the alcohol, but of course you can drink it sooner. 

You can drink it as is, take shots, or use it as a mixer with more cider or get creative. It‚Äôll taste soooo damn smooth, but it‚Äôs incredibly strong. I need to test the abv one of these days."
35405,"I love this! My boss actually shared a similar recipe, but they use honey as well, whiskey instead of everclear and drink it hot whenever they get sick! 

Question though. When you say ‚ÄúOn the stove, boil some with like a cup of brown sugar‚Äù how much cider are you talking about roughly?"
35406,"I‚Äôve also kept some of this brown sugar/cinnamon in a small bottle and use it in cocktails, especially rum based ones. If you‚Äôre feeling really lazy, use the leftover apple cider that didn‚Äôt fit in the jugs and do rum and cider with a little bit of that mixture. It‚Äôs really good and quick to whip up if you don‚Äôt want to drink the cider plain."
35407,Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely put that to use! You‚Äôre awesome!
35408,"Mmmm whiskey would be good too. I‚Äôve used brown sugar bourbon instead of everclear to make a richer, less college kid version. It‚Äôs just pricey. 

On the stove it doesn‚Äôt really matter, more than a couple cups as the sugar will saturate it. You‚Äôre really only giving the sugar something to dissolve in and since you‚Äôll be adding back cider later, the amount isn‚Äôt crucial. I like to err on the less side as it‚Äôll cool faster."
35409,Hot cider is really good with Kraken dark rum too.
35410,"Moscow Mule - the ginger beer and lime really do a lot to cover up the vodka flavor, especially if you use a good ginger beer (I love Maine Root‚Äôs ginger brew or Barritt‚Äôs)."
35411,Slightly better booze will mask easier. Kirkland vodka is stupidly easy to hide in any mixer.
35412,VODKA!!! Wait wahat was the question?
35413,This guy get its.
35414,"Besides specific drink mixes. One of the best tricks for this is to use large cups or containers. You can put 4+ shots in a big cup then top it with whatever juice or soda mixer and barely taste the alcohol but people will chug away as if it was just soda or juice. No matter the mix, 4 shots is four shots just might have to take a few extra bathroom breaks."
35415,"White Russians basically taste like chocolate milk.

You can put a *lot* of vodka into a screwdriver or Cape Cod before you can taste it. The purpose of vodka is pretty much to take non-alcoholic beverages and turn them into alcoholic beverages."
35416,"The best white russians IMO are made with E&J brandy (u/rogue_epileptic mentioned it in their suggestion) instead of vodka. E&J is trash if you want actual brandy but if you want sweet caramel flavor in a brandy-proof spirit, it's your goto. In particular, use their XO release.

It kills ANY of the vodka booziness that normal white russians can have if they are too spirit-heavy, so it should be useful for u/itssarakang.

Other people have almost mentioned completely cutting out the cream/milk and doing a shaken egg (dry shake or reverse dry shake preferably) and I can confirm that it improves the drink substantially.

Best part is that E&J costs next to nothing. The Kahlua is what will cost all the money."
35417,"Mojitos are great - especially when it‚Äôs hot out. The proportions of everything can adjusted based on personal taste - but here‚Äôs mine:

2oz white rum
.75-1oz simple syrup
Juice of half a lime
2-3 large mint leaves (try different kinds!)

Combine in a tall glass and use a muddler to chew up the mint. If you don‚Äôt have one, just toss a few ice cubes in a shaker and shake the hell out of it.

Top with club soda and lots of ice. 

I‚Äôve recently tried the unsweetened ‚Äònatural‚Äô soda water (lime flavored) with decent results when I didn‚Äôt have fresh limes, or was too lazy to squeeze them. Fresh mint leaves are a must, however. I‚Äôve also made simple syrup with baking Splenda - it tastes great, but just doesn‚Äôt add the same body that regular sugar does."
35418,Omg mojitos actually sound so good right now cause it is hooooot üôÑ thank you so much! üíñ
35419,"I really really need you to try it with heavy mint and light lime. It may change your life. 

Take a large handful of mint leaves in your glass, muddle them up just until well bruised, but stop before you start tearing leaves. Try and use the whole inside surface of the glass to middle leaves against. Then muddle well 1/6 of a lime into the bottom. 

Add ice, rum, a pinch of kosher salt, simple syrup (I use demerara syrup for added body) and mix together, then fill with soda water. Squeeze another 1/6 lime slice on top. 

Stir by dunking your bar spoon 2-3 times into the glass, trying to not float too many leaves on top. 

Take a 2inch sprig of mint, clap it between your hands twice to express the oils and make it fragrant, then insert into a cut lime slice to use as the garnish, so you can smell the mint leaves while drinking.

The drink focuses on mint, and uses lime for acidity to cut through the bitter from the mint. It's balanced, super refreshing, and can handle a LOT of rum before it tastes too strong."
35420,Will try it!
35421,Malibu Rum and Mountain Dew. Sneaks up on you real quick. My ratio starts at 60/40 (more dew) but by the second refill it is 50/50.
35422,"Malibu Rum, 151, pineapple juice. 

Have fun."
35424,Yes indeed. Thanks Tech!
35425,"Orange Gatorade and fireball. It sounds weird, but it tastes amazing"
35426,"Do you normally like fireball? I am disgusted by cinnamon whiskey, so I‚Äôm wondering if the Gatorade would help at all"
35427,"I don't really like it, but I don't dislike it. And I'm not a big Gatorade fan. But combined, it's so fucking good for no reason"
35428,I‚Äôm intrigued
35431,"If you try it, let us know if you enjoy it"
35430,Ooh I‚Äôm intrigued haha wouldn‚Äôt have thought of that combo
35432,"A couple of my favorite cocktails to serve to other people who don‚Äôt want to taste their alcohol either (I‚Äôd rather taste my gin) are these:

3/4 oz St Germain 
1 oz of gin
Top off with champagne (usually in a sniffer glass, or something similar.) Personally I do no ice. St Germain is expensive, so I‚Äôll only do this for like a date who comes over. 


Or just an Italian margarita. 
1 shot of each Amaretto and tequila 
1/2 oz of triple sec 
Top off with sour mix in a glass with ice. 

Personally if I‚Äôm drinking it, I do like half the sour and the rest water or soda water or even tonic. I don‚Äôt like sour mix that much though. Also this is something I make for guests, so I‚Äôll usually get like pitcher and do a cup or two of each amaretto and tequila, do 1/4-1/2 cup of the triple sec, and pour a bunch of sour to taste (like double what I did of tequila, so 2-4 cups). Then just pour that into glasses."
35433,Long island iced tea for sure
35434,"One of my favorites is a tall glass with a shot or two of vodka in it with strong, sugary lemonade"
35435,"Scoth and splenda, tastes like splenda but getd you drunk like scotch"
35436,An amaretto sour - I can‚Äôt taste the alcohol but damn when made properly they are beautiful
35437,I personally like cherry vodka and simple lemonade.  They can be dangerous.
35438,"I know it‚Äôs frozen- but bare with me:
A ‚ÄúBushwacker‚Äù
Awesome drink I used to made all the time in the USVI. A cool 70 year old island guy I tended bar with was said to be one of the creators.
 This is one way to make it- there are many variances...

Equal parts
-Dark Rum
-Triple Sec
-Amaretto
-Baileys
-Kahlua
-Cream of Coconut
Blended with ice

I‚Äôve seen people also throw in some 151 and vodka to make it stronger. Add peanut butter and you‚Äôve got an alcoholic Reece‚Äôs drink."
35439,"I‚Äôm really into water enhancers like Mio so it‚Äôll literally be just some ice cubes, silver tequila or vodka, and water enhancer. Flavor without the sugar induced hangover and quite potent as well."
35440,I like horse feathers. Rye whiskey with ginger beer and a bit of bitters.
35441,"Papo Js Lambanog Vodka, coconut water, and cold brew coffee on the rocks."
35442,Hooo SHIT!
35443,"1 shot gin, 1 shot peach schnapps, 1 shot watermelon juice"
35444,"Vodka and orange soda is good, it has some hints of vodka but other than that it has no alcohol taste"
35445,"Black eyed Susan‚Äôs can be made pretty strong and if you use a recipe with pineapple as well as oj you shouldn‚Äôt taste much

On the same note, a lot of rum drinks don‚Äôt taste too boozy if you make them well and don‚Äôt buy bottom of the barrel rum"
35446,"hillbilly lemonade:

this is a drink for a whole group but it's super good

* 5 lemons
* 1 cup sugar
* a full 26 of vodka
* ice

Roll the lemons to break up the juices then cut them into quarters. Put the lemon quarters and sugar into a 4L glass jar and fill mostly with ice. Pour in a full 26 of vodka. Wrap the jar in a tea towel and shake. The jar is ready once the outside of the jar is frosted.


Easily the best drink for groups out there.

edit: am bad at words"
35448,"was tired and doing other things when I wrote it, fixed now."
35449,"Missing a comma and a couple capitals. If this is you ""not trying to be a dick"", I wonder what dickish heights you could reach if you put your mind to it."
35450,You just see that mt Fuji post?
35451,Whew! High heights! Don't stop now!
35452,"My favorite easy summertime drink usually fits this bill, as it's contingent on how heavy you pour.

It's usually just a half can of strong ginger ale (The best is called Northern Neck Ginger Ale, and can usually be found in a small part of Virginia to my knowledge) OR a ginger beer.

1-1/2oz of Bourbon

Sometimes I twist it with whatever bitters I have on hand, so far my favorite is an orange mix by a brand called Wigle."
35453,"coconut daiquiri: 

1.5oz coconut rum (i recommend shipwreck or something made with real coconuts)
1oz fresh lime juice
.5oz simple syrup

shake with ice and serve in a martini glass"
35454,"I just remembered another affordable party favorite. Svedka is incredibly cheap, so I‚Äôd buy a bottle or two of the cherry one and mix it with sprite and a little lime sweetener and garnish with lime over ice. It tastes like a cherry limeade but not the medicine kind of cherry. The weaklings love it lol."
35455,Negroni
35456,Gin and grapefruit juice.
35457,"L.A Water! ( or Jurassic Water if you‚Äôre at universal studios)

LA WATER
1/2 oz. (15ml) Vodka
1/2 oz. (15ml) Gin
1/2 oz. (15ml) Tequila
1/2 oz. (15ml) Rum
1/2 oz. (15ml) Triple Sec
1/2 oz. (15ml) Melon Liqueur
1/2 oz. (15ml) Raspberry Liqueur
1/2 oz. (15ml) Blue Curacao
1/2 oz. (15ml) Sweet & Sour
Garnish: Orange Wedge/Cherry

PREPARATION
1. Add ice to tall glass before pouring over vodka, gin, tequila, rum, triple sec, sweet and sour, melon liqueur, raspberry liqueur and blue cura√ßao.
2. Garnish with an orange wedge and a cherry."
35458,I‚Äôll be making this drink this weekend that‚Äôs for sure.
35459,"Gin, creme de cocoa, and triple sec. Equal parts. Shaken with ice. Served in a martini glass. Sounds disgusting, tastes good, but very strong."
35460,"Isn't that the whole point of the Long Island Iced Tea's existence?  lol

Otherwise, take whatever sweet soft drink you want and dump a bunch of vodka in it, that ought to do the trick.  Some dark/spiced rums are sweet enough that you can mix them strong and hardly notice.  Kracken is like that and so is Diplomatico.  Half and half with a dark soda and it won't taste much different from the soda itself.

Also, not a mixed drink and doesn't really fit the mood at a ""drink to get drunk"" party, but some wine can be very, very sweet/not taste alcoholic, and if you drink it quick it'll hit you wayyyy harder than 13-15% ABV logically should."
35461,Amaretto and Sprite tastes like cream soda. Amaretto is usually like 28% but if you‚Äôre throwing them back like regular sodas it‚Äôll get you there pretty quickly.
35462,"Skippy: 
1 Gal cheap vodka
1 30 pack of cheap beer (Natty Ice is best)
1 full container of Country Time lemonade
1 bag of ice

Mix in a (preferably new) kitchen sized trazh can with a wiffle ball bat and serve in red solo cup. Enjoy.
 Substitute lemonade with pnk lemonade to make ""Damn Skippy"""
35464,Jokers. Morgan‚Äôs Spiced Rum and Orange Fanta.  Tastes like the Joker ice lollies.
35465,"The Jolly Rancher

Very simple. UV Vodka (Blue) + Blue Raspberry Calypso Lemonade.

Be careful."
35466,White Russians are nice especially if you use powdered creamer. I like them because you have a full serving of vodka and a liqueur as well with no mix.
35467,Equal parts of E & J brandy and blackberry brandy with ice.
35468,"Personally, I'm a fan of a 1:5 ratio of Rum and fresh apple cider. The bite of the apple cider hides the kick of the rum, even if it's a mule of a kick.

It's definitely not a refined drink, but if you like cider, it's something that I'd definitely recommend."
35469,"Pfffftss.. Sounds like you should be telling HIM to pour you a whiskey then have him go wash the dishes! :D jus jokes lol

Buy a bottle of Caribbean 151/Puncheon, like Forres Park. Usually its cheap, like 20$ but its like 70 sumtin + percent alcohol. Mix it with strong fruit juices or whatever... The thing is because its stronger you use less, so you have to use more juice to fill the cup. It also doesn't seem to smell much or carry a strong flavor like dark rums. 

Seriously tho.. Puncheon is notorious down in the west indies for fkin pple up lol."
35470,"Here‚Äôs my favorite. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúDrink‚Äù
1. Take a lowball glass
2. Add 3 ice cubes. No more. No less. For Dale.
3. Pour Jim Beam over ice
4. Drink"
35471,"One of the older guys I work with shared this gem with me:

Combine White Monsters and however much Jaeger you want. Tastes like a monster and you can easily drink and entire fifth without realizing it, until you stand up that is."
35472,Vodka and Cran-Apple. I can go half and half and I still don't taste the vodka. Great way to get plastered fast.
35473,"For real though, any vodka mixed roght with mountain dew is decent"
35474,"Oldie but goodie (we used this in punch bowls for college parties because it's cheap and tastes good, but be warned, it'll fuck you up). One fifth of cheap vodka,  two big bottles of Old English (or similar malt beverage... mostly for the carbonation) and a can of frozen strawberry lemonade concentrate. Let the concentrate unfreeze, mix all ingredients in a punch bowl. Boom! Super strong, fruity, fizzy, tastes like juice. Be warned, people will guzzle and puke."
35475,"2-3 shots vodka, 1 teaspoon of Powerade powder finish off with sprite in a 330ml glass, enjoy."
35480,**HENNESSY AND HORCHATA**
35481,Iced oolong tea and peach liqueur...I tried it in Japan and now it's one of my go to cocktails.
35482,"Try infusing Earl Grey tea (in the teabag works fine) in 2 oz of gin (I like broker's) for about 2 hours. Fill a shaker with ice, mix in infused gin with splash of lemon juice and 1/4 oz simple syrup.

Line the glass with lemon juice and sugar.  You now have the perfect Earl Grey martini."
35484,"Gently whisper ""*vermouth*"" to the glass."
35485,Noel Coward said that to make the perfect martini you added gin and then wave it in the general direction of Italy.
35486,"I think I'm going to that next time someone asks for their martini ""*verrrrrrryy* dry."""
35487,"that's what I expect, take a shot of vermouth and breath lightly on my cold gin"
35488,"French 75- Named for the first pneumatic artillery piece the French developed in WW1 (75mm) 

4 oz Champagne,
1 shot of gin,
1 teaspoon of sugar, 
and a squeeze of lemon juice

French officers would down 1 or 2 of these before dashing over the parapet and on to their deaths. It‚Äôs my favorite New Years drink. 

*corrected for spelling, you pricks."
35489,"This is a great drink. As a funny/terrible variation we made one up called the American 75. It uses rye whiskey instead of gin, and the champagne of beers.."
35490,That seems like a recipe for puking...  I like it.
35491,"In Poland we have this drink called 'kocio≈Çek Panoramixa' ([Getafix's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_characters_in_Asterix#Getafix) kettle). You basically take a big pot or kettle, pour 1l of vodka, 3 light beers, bottle of some sparkling wine, 1l of an energetic drink and a bottle (500ml or so) of one of these condensed raspberry or cherry syrups. Stir it up, some like it heated, most just take it from here drinking shots from the kettle.

It's surprisingly not that bad when you drink it, but hangover is bloody apocalyptic."
35492,We have light beer in Poland?
35493,"So picture this: WW1 battle, muddy trenches... On the French side we see officers sitting at a clean table with clean chairs on a clean rug in the muddy trench. Legs crossed, sipping from mugs, and a butler standing by the table waiting for orders. On the table we have a bowl of fresh lemons, a sugar cube box, and 2 bottles of champagne, and 1 bottle of gin.

I'm absolutely certain that this happened. In a Monty Python skit."
35494,"Ginger beer and dark rum aka a Dark and Stormy.

Delicious!"
35495,"You're forgetting the lime juice, which is an integral part in blending the flavors."
35496,"A squirt of fresh lime juice improves most drinks. It's like the salt of drinking. A sprinkle of salt draws out the flavor of food, a squirt of lime draws out the flavor of drinks. If you think your drink is missing something, try squeezing a lime wedge into it.

Source: Bartender for several years."
35497,it actually suppresses the alcohol taste which is why it's used.
35498,"Try it with Sailor Jerry. Add a dash of bitters and a squeeze of lime juice. Throw in a couple pineapple chunks. For bonus points, freeze pineapple before hand and use instead of ice. For an extra heart container, cut the pineapple chunks into triangles before you freeze them, and put three into the drink. You've got the triforce floating there.

I call it The Song of Storms.

Edit: better without this."
35499,"I was with you on the bitters + lime, then against you on the pineapple, then TOTALLY WITH YOU ON THE PINEAPPLE.

Thanks for the laugh, also I'm definitely making this for my going away party next week. Due credit will be given to BananafishGlass."
35500,"One if the classics! Gotta have a good dark rum, something like el Dorado"
35501,I use kraken
35502,That bottle <3
35503,"Goslings 151 is pretty good for 'em too.  That, and sometimes a splash of Boulder Brewery Kinda Blue Beer (hint of blueberry taste goes well with the D&S)."
35504,Vernors and whiskey
35505,What up Michigan!
35506,"THIS! Classic highball! I can drink them to no end, even at a 50/50 ratio!

And it HAS to be Vernors - FUCK Seagrams!"
35507,"As a Michigander, I applaud your support of Vernors."
35508,Vernors is the greatest.
35510,Ditto! It cures what ails ya!
35511,"I'm a huge fan of Old Fashioned, a great cocktail that's perfect for an after work delight.

For the most bang/buck, get Rittenhouse Rye Whisky.  It's not bad and is high in alcohol content.

Play with the ratios to find what you like best:


Rye Whisky (I use about 2-3oz depending on mood)

Simple Syrup (Just get the cheap stuff at grocery store - .5-1oz)

Angostura Bitters (Can get at most grocery stores - a few drops)

Orange or Lemon Peel (I use a potato peeler to get a big chunk.  Wipe it on rim of glass and drop it into drink when done - you are really going for aroma more than anything.  I like about 1/6th of the peel/rind, my wife likes about half of the fruit's peel)

Give it a gentle stir over ice - sip and enjoy."
35512,"Make your own simple syrup, people, for fuck's sake.  It takes 5 minutes to make and 20 minutes to cool.  It's water and sugar 1:1 or 2:1 or 1.5:1 or however the fuck you like it.  Don't buy that shit."
35513,"Even easier trick: blend the water and sugar for 2 minutes then let it sit for 5 minutes to settle. BAM instant simple syrup.
Source: I'm a pastry cook."
35514,Moscow Mule:  One part vodka and one part Ginger beer with lime.
35515,"Don't forget the copper mug, muhfucka!"
35516,"Add a dash of Angosturra to that. 

You can thank me later."
35517,"One thing you should never try is a bear fight. It is an Irish car bomb and a jeager bomb taken in succesion. 

It feels like two bears fighting in your stomach and creates mustard gas ass."
35518,This was the most memorable drink from my 21st birthday. By most memorable I mean the very last thing I remember. I pulled a set of stairs off of someone's front door that night.
35519,Think you went a step too far.
35520,"We did one of those in a bar after the US won a big World Cup game in 2010. Except we did the car bomb, followed by a jaeger bomb, followed by a pint of beer. Yea. The bar staff filmed it to put on their website, but the bar is closed now."
35521,That area is now a biohazard.
35522,"Holy shit. I was introduced to the ""Bear Fight"" about 6 years ago in my prime alcohol tolerance days. I had had J√§ger Bombs and Car Bombs on many occasions but some kind of evil dark magic occurs when you mix the two. I have never been so fucked up so quickly in my life. I'm having PTSD flashbacks right now."
35523,"Had two bearfights in about an hour with my friends and roommates at the time, one got banned from the bar for life and the other put his head through the wall. Luckily, he did not find a stud behind that particular section of drywall. 

I peed. 

EDIT: for clarification, the head thru wall and pee was actually back at our place."
35524,Equal parts kahluha and Frangdlico in a shot glas. Add a pinch of salt. You have created liquid snickers.
35525,whipped cream vodka + frangelico + lick of salt = chocolate covered pretzel deliciousness
35526,"WHAT. Shut your face, really?"
35527,"Its one of my favorite shots! Seriously.  Fill shot glass almost full with Whipped cream vodka, top off with a bit of frangelico. Place salt on hand, like salt and take shot.  Its EXACTLY like a chocolate covered pretzel. How? Idk, alcohol magic."
35529,"Disaronno and Apple Cider.  Drink it around Halloween/Thanksgiving, festive and tasty."
35530,"Disaronno was the first liquor I could drink strait, its like Dr. Peppers laid back sister.


EDIT: Or pehaps Dr. Pepper's distractingly attractive assistant."
35531,I mix it with Coca-Cola and it tastes exactly like Dr. Pepper
35532,Give it a try in ginger ale. So tasty.
35533,"As an avid consumer of dairy products, White Russian. It's like childhood meets adulthood in a perfect, cold blend."
35534,in a bar in Prague they put scops of vanilla ice cream in
35535,Going to Prague next week! Which bar?
35536,"I can think of at least a hundred places that sell vanilla ice cream within 20 miles of my house. You don't have to jump on a plane to Prague to get it, man.

**edit:** for everybody who took me and my claims of 100 places seriously, most convenience stores in Austin (or around Texas and California, from my experience) have a small freezer in them that sell pints of ice cream. On top of that, every grocery store sells vanilla ice cream. There are ice cream shops and restaurants everywhere, and I challenge you to find a restaurant with a dessert menu that doesn't have vanilla ice cream. I can deduce that if given a 20 mile radius of Austin, TX, I could find at least 100 locations that sell vanilla ice cream."
35537,wheres your house?
35538,Prague
35540,"Colorado Bulldog - White Russian with a splash of Coke. My drink of choice.

Edit- GOLD? Are you kidding me?!? Thanks dudes. I never knew drinking so much could make me so happy."
35541,We call those Paralyzer's up here in Canada
35542,"""Well that's just like, your opinion, man.""

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, [this is how I feel](http://marshallmatlock.com/wp-content/gallery/the-mans-man-xxxviii-jeff-bridges/thumbs/thumbs_jeff-bridges-the-big-lebowski-dream-sequence.jpg)"
35543,"I don't always go on a white russian kick, but when I do, it's likely that I just watched The Big Lebowski."
35544,There's a beverage here man
35545,I fuckin hate the eagles
35546,Calmer than you are.
35547,Phone's ringin' Dude.
35548,"Thank you, Donny!"
35549,"I like them better with Bailey's, my wife prefers vodka. Either way they are delicious!"
35550,"Compromise: Keep the vodka, replace cream / milk with Bailey's, and you have a Blind Russian."
35551,TIL I've been accidentally making blind Russians.
35552,"My friends and I have called them Blind Russians for years, but no one ever knows what I'm talking about. I was beginning to think that it was all in my head, that maybe, in reality, I have no friends and no memories of my drunken interactions with them ordering ""Blind Russians,"" I have only fantasies of a life lived in the outside world involved with other humans with whom I have true relationships with. All this time in this god damn cave watching the shadows dance on the walls in the faint light of the flickering fire has really fucked with my head.

Fuck Yeah! Blind Russians!!"
35553,"It's chocolate milk for adults. 1 shot of vodka, 2 shots of Kahlua, fill the rest of the glass with ice and milk."
35554,"This is how I discovered I was lactose intolerant.

Always avoided milk because it made me feel funny. Drank about a million one night in college. The next day was spent sitting on the toilet (which I guess is better than with my head in it)."
35555,"May have been the million cocktails you had, not just the milk."
35556,"""I drank a 5th of Vodka and 5th Kahula. The milk made me sick."""
35557,"Cranberry juice, sprite, and dragonberry bacardi. It tastes like a pink starburst.

Also scotch, because manly things..."
35558,We make the same mixed shot (sprite + cran + dragonfruit Bacardi) and call it a Huxtable because it tastes like jello.
35559,It's only 9:20 am and I want a drink now :(
35560,"Gimme some gin, cucumber juice, mint leaf, and a squeeze of some fresh lime and it's a great day!"
35561,The cucumber gimlet is fantastic. It's my favorite too!
35562,Jameson + Canada Dry = happiness
35563,"This was my gateway drink into proper whiskey and I'll always appreciate it. Started out more ginger and less whiskey, then eventually, ginger on the side, no ice. Then just Jameson. Then moved onto, ""Jameson? That's for plebes. Give me a Bushmills Black at *least*.""

And on and on until you're paying $60-$80 for a bottle of 12 year old single malt and find yourself thinking, ""this is *okay* but I bet the 18 year is the shit."" Hopefully by the time that rolls around you've got the job to pay for it."
35564,Straight vodka and sorrow.  Wake up next day and repeat.
35565,"Ah, the old family recipe."
35566,"yeah, my father used to cook it for himself everyday...aaah the memories"
35567,"I prefer my sorrow blended with whiskey, I think it brings out the hopelessness of the situation in a better way. Best served alone, without a glass."
35568,With or without a brown bag?
35569,Depends of if you're in public or not.
35570,"I prefer mixing my vodka with bad decisions and regret. But to each their own, right?"
35571,Ah a drink straight from the motherland
35572,"Green Russians:
Absinthe,
Milk"
35573,"Thanks, Pam."
35574,Shit Snacks.
35575,"I have a good recipe:

2oz Absinthe
2oz milk (cow)
1oz vodka
1oz cr√®me de menthe

Shake over ice and serve in a martini glass.

I made this drink for three of my closest friends and they couldn't stand even one sip. So I downed theirs for them. I had a dream I was fighting a dragon that night. In the morning I found I had ripped everything off the walls in my bathroom: mirrors, towel holders, even curtain rods. GREAT DRINK 10/10."
35576,Fireball whiskey and Angry Orchard hard cider.
35577,Angry Balls
35578,I would call it Forest Fire..... ha.
35579,Which is probably what would happen if I wandered into a forest after drinking that
35580,"Balls-in-cider (say it out loud), is the best name I've heard for this wonderful drink."
35581,"Oh Fireball, guaranteed heartburn in the morning."
35582,Last time I drank Fireball I thought it gave me a concussion
35583,"Friends of mine were feeding my wife these at the bar a few months back. I thought she was drinking regular ol' cider. She loves cider, and those taste like a cold variant of holiday cider. I should mention she's a featherweight drinker.


About the same time as she's had three of these, my buddy hands me one, and says ""try this"". I think he's goading me to chug it, so I do. He goes wide eyed as I finish it, and ask him what the hell it is, because it's delicious and it tastes like Christmas.
 

He goes: ""It's an Angry Balls"", 


To which I reply: ""What in the fuck is an Angry Balls?"" 


He informs me of the contents, prompting my response of ""you mean a boilermaker. It's a fucking evil delicious boilermaker! (panicked glance at wife) How many of those has she had!?""


She went from giggly-good-time girl to can't-function-drunk puke machine in about an hour. I got to clean puke out of the window seal of the car. And the door pockets. And the carpet. And the seat. And her hair. There would be no crazy-drunk married people sex that night.


The better part of an hour had gone by, with me de-puking our grocery getter when I rolled the window up and found out the hard way that puke had been introduced to the space between the window seals. There is no easy way to clean that.


Did I mention we'd had Hibachi that night? Rice-filled hibarfchi was hardened down the entire passenger side of the vehicle. It was damn near part of the paint. That was her first and last experience with Angry Balls, mine too, most likely. The joy of the beverage has been tainted by the crushing despair the night ended with.  




TL;DR My wife drank too many Angry Balls, and I went to bed with Angry Balls."
35584,Fireball and rum chata = Cinnamon toast crunch milk
35585,I love both of these and I am leaving for a trip to a cabin so this is getting a try.
35586,Or fireball whiskey and dark chocolate hot chocolate
35588,"While there are a million amazing beers out there, to say nothing of the various spirits... if we are talking cocktails and the like I would have to say the vodka, lemon lime bitters.

* Shot of vodka,

* 2 squirts of lemon juice,

* 1 squirt of lime, (squirts can be whatever size tastes good, but generally a 2:1 ratio of lemon to lime works best for me).

* A couple of dashes of [Angostura bitters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura_bitters) over an ice cube or two.

* Lemon squash to fill; using Australian terminology, this is not like Sprite or 7up, but more like a lemonade in the vein of [Solo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_%28Australian_soft_drink%29), which is apparently like Rondo in the US (if in doubt, aim for a cloudy, carbonated lemonade that tastes like they used real juice).


The final colour is a pink shading to orange, garnish with a wedge of lemon or lime, and enjoy the summer heat."
35589,Makers and ginger ale works every time.
35590,"Instead of ginger ale, try Ale81. I mean, if you're going Kentucky, why not go all the way?"
35591,"From Kentucky, can confirm that Ale 8 and Maker's is delicious."
35592,I do this but with Beam all the time.  Maker's goes on the rocks.
35593,"1 part Godiva Chocolate Liquer
1 part Bailey's Irish Cream
1 part Vanilla flavored vodka

It'll taste just like a boston creme pie."
35594,"Hennessy, sprite, and lemon. KCTea baby! Thanks to Tech N9ne for this and the Caribou Lou recipe."
35595,"Something no one should ever try is jaeger mixed with apple juice, it looks like a urine infection and tastes like one as well"
35596,"Maaannn, if I ever work a bar for a house party, my friends are fucked.

*hands drink* ""Here man, try this out!""

*sips* ""Bleh! What the fuck is this?!""

""Urine infection"""
35598,"""MOM, I'M GONNA HAVE SOME OF THIS SLUSHY IN THE FREEZER! OKAY?"""
35599,"""Ok Billy, but no going outside afterwards!"""
35600,"""Fuck you cunt. You can't tell me what I can and can't do"""
35601,That intensified rapidly.
35602,*intensifying intensifies*
35603,**[INTENSITY INTENSIFIES]**
35604,"That almost happened to a friend's kid. Except it was mushroom tea. Buckle up, Tucker."
35605,Who the fuck leaves mushroom tea where a kid can get it?
35606,Bad parents.
35607,"aha the Rob Ford. 

edit: for clarity, Vodka and Gatorade is Rob Ford's drink of choice. I don't know if he does the slush thing but it sounds cool."
35608,"There is usually 5-6 Red Bulls and some NyQuil* to make it a Rob Ford.

[*edit: spelling]

[Edit 2: I don't actually drink this]"
35609,"NyQuil has acetaminophen in it. Acetaminophen is **hepatotoxic** (toxic to the liver) if you:

- take too much

- combine it with alcohol

It sounds like you're doing what you can to accelerate liver cirrhosis. Hell, even taking too much acetaminophen alone can cause liver failure within days."
35610,What the fuck is Nitequil?
35611,A porcupine themed superhero.
35613,"The crazy amount of sugar in the Gatorade will actually make the hangover worse.

Edit: I don't have a source I can link you to, and I can't imagine where I would find an academic paper or equally reputable source on the effects of combining Gatorade with binge drinking. My source is my own personal experience with seriously nasty hangovers that resulted in drinking a tried and true amount of alcohol where the only x factor was the addition of sugary drinks."
35614,"But vodka is 60 percent water, so shoul  keep you hydrated by itself."
35615,Flawless logic.
35617,This is a high school drink.
35618,"This should be marked NSFW.

It's not even noon and I want to get drunk already."
35619,ITT:  The college experience.
35620,I was going to go with ITT: People under 21
35621,People under 21 making shopping lists for their friends over 21.
35622,That's also /r/alcohol. I subbed thinking it was a place for adults to discuss booze but almost every thread is a newly 21 year old asking for the best way to get drunk because he doesn't like the taste of any alcohol he's tried .
35623,"Join us in /r/cocktails or any of the spirit-specific subreddits (/r/bourbon, /r/scotch, /r/gin, /r/rum, etc.) for actual intelligent booze discussion and reviews."
35624,"A moscow mule; vodka, ginger beer and lime."
35625,Vodka and sweetened iced tea got me through my first year of university...
35626,Firefly Vodka.  Try it with Lemonade.
35627,The Arnold Facepalmer
35628,It's called a John Daly - who was another golfer and apparently an incredible alcoholic.
35629,"Alcoholic, gambler, and known for his [rage quits.]  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73fHnz6kMk) 

So naturally, a fan favorite.  A golfer the rest of us hacks can relate to. 

PS:  A John Daly is delicious.  I've been drinking them for years."
35630,This guy gets it - sweet combo
35631,"Vodka and cheap Popsicles. Put the Popsicle into vodka and stir until the Popsicle is gone.

Apparently Popsicle HAS to be capitalized on Reddit."
35632,That's because it's a euphemism for erection
35633,Almost everything can be an euphemism for erection on reddit.
35634,"Hehe, you said ""euphemism"""
35635,"lol, your mom gave me a euphemism last night"
35636,I woke up this morning with a raging Euphemism.
35637,"Sailor Jerry's and cherry coke. 

Also tried Sailor Jerry's and orange juice while high. Called it sp'O-J (pronounced spo-jay; ""sp"" = abbreviation for ""spiced""). 

Can't verify that it's good other than it tasted like a Floridian Christmas."
35638,Sailor Jerry's and my mouth.
35639,the Navy might want a word with you..
35640,Sailor Jerry's and Cheerwine
35641,My friends drink sailor Jerry and cream soda. Obviously had to call it a creamy sailor.
35642,Why not Creamy Sea-men?
35643,"Vodka and Mountain Dew

The taste of raid night"
35644,"This is what we call the ""college freshman"""
35645,"Can confirm, had a stash of skol and many trips to the dormitory vending machine...

I wisened up by second semester and explored campus town, found a knockoff Dollar General store and landed myself a new favorite: Mountain Thunder. More sugar than Mtn Dew but only $0.68 for 2 liters."
35646,I hate but just because you're right.
35647,I can almost taste the wipes.
35649,Pickle Backs! SO GOOD.
35650,"Nah, I'd rather save my pickle juice so I can dip my fingers in it and flick it on my sandwiches for flavor."
35651,Pickle backs!
35652,"Master Bomb: its a shot of Everclear dropped into an FDA-banned Four Loko and you pound it.


**EDIT:** Thanks u/Spitball_Idea, Tsar Bomb is a way better name!"
35653,"We call this ""The Dead Freshman."""
35654,"There's a similar drink I unfortunately think I invented as a college freshman. I called it a Bulldog. Basically it was a Brass Monkey except sub a 40 and OJ for a bottle of MD 20/20 (""Mad Dog"") and a Red Bull energy drink. Drink your dog halfway then top the bottle off with the Red Bull. Proceed to have a party for one under a bridge somewhere. Wake up missing teeth."
35655,That sounds terrible
35657,"And a four loko is almost the same alcohol content as a bottle of wine.

This would fuck you up damn quick"
35658,I can never take one shot of everclear. I was stupid to take shots of it at all. I would tske 1 shot and it would just set my stomach on fire. 2nd shot would make me give less a shit about the burn. 3rd shot I would wanna puke. This was the 190 proof (95% alcohol) everclear. Not the 151. I was an idiot.
35659,"You understand that everclear will burn your skin, right? Biology labs clean with ethanol no more concentrated than 140 proof.

The burn in your stomach and throat is your inner lining getting destroyed. It's really really bad for you.

EDIT: I'm not saying not to use everclear, but make sure to dilute it down a little bit before consuming. Mix it with cake vodka for a birthday cake fire shot. It's like a birthday candle"
35660,"That's just outright wrong.  Everclear will not burn your skin.  Ethanol and isopropanol are common solvents in shops as well and I've been literally covered in the stuff.  It will burn your mucous membranes and this can cause cancer, so it's not good to drink it, but not your skin...

As well, every lab I've ever set foot in had reagent ethanol in a squirt bottle handy.  Usually a few scattered around the lab.  Some denatured and at least one not."
35661,"Chem/bio labs use 95% ethanol all the time. above that and there's a good chance that there's benzene in it as a drying agent, so don't drink the 99.99% lab grade ethanol."
35662,"1 part whiskey, 2 parts whiskey... Whiskey"
35663,I'm allergic to whiskey. It makes my knuckles bleed.
35664,I break out in handcuffs
35665,White chocolate godiva liquor and milk. Tastes like a white chocolate milk.
35666,"we call these types of drinks ""honkeys"""
35667,"As a manager for a large liquor store I've had many nights experimenting....this is my mainstay now:

Fill a standard shaker with ice, 2 -1.5 oz shots of vodka (khortytsa mixes like a champ, hank birdwells rocks for 10 bucks, 1835 lonestsr vodka kicks ass, fuck Titos and their over priced sweet corn bs, reyka is my favorite....) Then three parts grapefruit juice to one part pineapple juice. Shake and pour out but don't stop, jiggle the shaker and you'll top the drink with this delicious foam that is a by product of the shaking process...."
35668,"Crack open a Corona, fill to the top with Bacardi Limon rum, thumb in the top and carefully turn upside down so they mix. Enjoy your delicious lemonhead :)"
35669,I usually drink the neck of the Corona so I have more room for Bacardi Limon.
35670,"Bullfrog:
1 shot tequila (silver)
1 shot rum (clear)
1 shot vodka 
1 shot hypnotiq
1 shot blue cura√ßao
Pour over ice
Add Red Bull until drink has a bright blue/green color. 

ENJOY SLOWLY...THIS WILL KICK YOUR ASS"
35671,"Sub triple sec for the hypnotiq (because I'm not paying for hypnotiq) and you've got a ""trashcan."""
35672,"Your variant I've heard called an ""Irish trashcan"" (because apparently to Americans, anything green is Irish)."
35673,"Brewer's toddy.  Note:  This only works for people who brew beer at home.

Take a mug of freshly made sweet wort, add desired amount of whiskey/bourbon/scotch, and consume.  Absolutely amazing."
35674,Vanilla Vodka + Ginger Ale.  Tastes like a cream soda.
35675,Jack and Depression.
35676,"Strong ginger beer and dark rum. Simple, accessible, tasty. Throw a bit of lime in there too if you have it."
35677,Bailey's from a shoe
35678,"White wine, mulled cider, honey crisp apples, pears and some whiskey. Let it sit. Enjoy."
35679,"Vodka and vodka, i call it ""The Russian""."
35680,'Right Russian'
35681,a lot
35682,And free
35683,Most of it
35684,All of it
35685,"Old Fashioned, Manhattan or a Boulevardier."
35686,"Old Fashioneds during the winter, Gin and Tonics during the summer, Beer all the time."
35687,You and I would get along
35688,This is the most I've agreed with something here in a while
35689,"Brandy Old Fashioned, with muddled orange and cherry. 

Easiest way to identify a Wisconsinite..."
35690,Brandy Old Fashion Sweet...enough said.
35691,"I like Campari and I like bourbon, so I love making myself boulevardiers. I rarely order them when I go out, though, because I cringe at how pretentious it sounds to say ""boulevardier"" out loud."
35692,"I don't even hide how pretentious I am anymore, makes life easier."
35693,"Mojitos! 
With one poured out for Thad Castle of course"
35694,I feel ya brobeans.
35695,I read this in his high pitched voice
35696,SHUT UUPP!
35697,GET OUT OF MY HOOOOUUUSSE
35698,"HEY EVERYBODY, HUGE ALCOHOL PARTY AT THE GOAT HOUSE!!!"
