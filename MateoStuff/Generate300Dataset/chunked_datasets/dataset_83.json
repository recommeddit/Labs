26612,"I have played plenty of games on your list and I think most are great. But for someone new to the hobby these are quite complex.

I lent King of Tokyo to my sister and she struggled to understand the rules, also found sushi go tricky from the rules till she played it."
26613,King of Tokyo is probably the game I have given the most as a gateway game. Everyone but one person has loved it.
26614,"I wasn't implying it is a bad or difficult game but people new to the hobby can struggle with the most basic games when left on their own.

My wife said I should have just linked a how to play YouTube clip which is amazing in itself that it's a way to learn a game and great for new players"
26615,"I thought about that and then re-read the original post. After doing so I still wasn't sure what the OP's experience with board games is. 

The post just said that he wanted to play more games and wasn't familiar with all the games on the market so I started rattling some of my favorites off. :)"
26616,Where the heck did you play Sol:Last Days of a Star??? I've only ever seen it at conventions...
26617,"I just received a copy. Elephant Laboratories are selling them direct from their website. $70, shipped pretty quickly."
26618,I backed it on Kickstarter. There's a copy on my shelf! :)
26619,Awesome! I must have missed the kickstarter... I'll have to keep my eyes open for that.
26620,You can buy it directly from Elephant Laboratories. I did the other day and am (im)patiently waiting for it.
26621,I'm loving Lords of Waterdeep. I got it for Christmas and have played it through 3 times already. I suppose the D&D flavour isn't necessary but it adds great flavour to the game.
26622,There's a decent port of it on Steam if you want to play and no one is around.
26623,"Nice list!

Power Grid is a great auction game as well."
26624,"Hi- welcome to the hobby :-) 

There are so many good games out there you could end up with dozens of different top tens. You'll probably hear/read the term 'gateway' game- used to describe good games which help introduce the various mechanics/rules you might encounter in other 'heavier' (more complex) games. You could consider looking at these games initially. 

Note- there is nothing at all wrong with these gateway games- they are immensely popular and important to the hobby. Some names you may have heard of: Settlers of Catan, Carcossone, Ticket to Ride. 

A genre that really got me into the hobby was co-operative games. You and the other players are working together to ""beat the game"". There are many many available now- the first one I tried was Pandemic. 

I'm sure others will chip in with great suggestions. 

Do you have a rough player count? I.e. How many you will usually be playing with? 

Happy New Year"
26625,"Not really my personal favorites but games that will definitely see play:

1. Settlers of Catan
2. Ticket to Ride
3. Dominion
4. Bohnanza
5. Codenames
6. Liar's Dice (perudo)
7. The Climbers
8. Istanbul
9. Keyflower
10. Puerto Rico"
26626,"Before you buy anything, I'd STRONGLY urge you to head to your nearest FLGS to try the game prior to buying. Also, keep in mind 
 - your friends/family may really dislike a game you absolutely love, so it may rarely be played (I'm looking at you Camp Grizzly). 

That in mind, I've had the most success playing the following with in-laws and random acquaintances.

* **Sushi Go** - Quick, fun, cheap, easy to find, and easy to teach/learn. This is the game my in-laws always ask to play when they come over. 

* **Kings of Tokyo** - A mid-priced game, but still really simple, easy to find, and a lot of fun. It's basically a form of yahtzee, but you get to play as movie monsters. 

* **Pandemic** (Any non-legacy version) - There are multiple types of Pandemic, and they're all great. If it is your first time playing, I would probably stay away from Legacy (Season 1 or 2); even though, they are both great games. Oddly, my family most enjoys the Cthulhu version. 

* **Barenpark** - This is a simple to learn build-your-own tableau game. There is limited competition, and I've usually found everyone really happy at the end of the game - win or lose.

* **One Deck Dungeon** - This is a bit of an oddity for me. I think the game is alright, but my wife and sister-in-law *LOVE* this game. I don't quite get why they like it so much, but regardless, I'm out-voted, so it sees regular play.

* **Dungeon Roll** - This is the game we ""settle"" on when I can't take any more One Deck Dungeon. It's simple, quick, and addictive dice rolling game that everyone enjoys.

* **Small World** - a.k.a. ""Fancy Risk"" by my father-in-law. I really like this game, and I've taught and played it countless times with friends a family. I'd strongly recommend this as one of your first ""major"" purchases.

* **Jaipur** - a.k.a. ""The Camel Game"" by most of my family. It's a cheap and simple set collection game built for two people, but we regularly play teams of two. 

* **Friday** - Sometimes, you'll have nobody to play with, and this is why I'd strongly suggest Friday. It's cheap, easy to learn, challenging, and fun; however, it's built for only one player.

* **Tiny Epic _________** - There are several ""Tiny Epic X"" games out there, and they're all really good and fairly priced. I'd start with Tiny Epic Galaxies (as it is the easiest to learn and most played in my house); however, my favorite is Tiny Epic Western. 

* **Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** - Another oddity on my list, but this time, my father-in-law and I are the ones who love this game, while everyone else just tolerates it. It's a game that requires quite a bit of set-up and thinking, so it isn't for everyone."
26627,"Why CoB the card game and not regular CoB? I have both and prefer regular CoB over card version, hence the question."
26628,"Power grid

The resistance: Avalon

Roads and boats

Thurns and taxis

Stoneage

Ascension

7 wonders

Splendor

Go (Baduk)

Euchre or; Roll for the Galaxy

Edit: Euchre isn't a board game."
26629,Nobody seems to be mentioning Scotland Yard so I’ll just add it in here quick. :)
26630,"An oldie and seemingly hidden gem, but definitely beloved in my family."
26631,"My current top 10 (whatever that’s worth). Have fun with all the lists. In no particular order. All of them are notable providing great experience throughout the years. 

1.	Codenames - A smart word game that’s sweet from 3-8 players in my experience. Vanilla and Pictures are solid. Skip the rest. 
2.	Monikers - Taboo meets Charades with some fun pop and internet references for cards
3.	Kingdomino - A fascinating quick tile placement game. 
4.	Secret Hitler - A great social deduction game for 5-10 players. 
5.	Camel Up - My favorite betting game with fascinating movements. 
6.	Android Netrunner Revised Core Set - This is a great complex 2 player cyber punk game. Lots of variety out of the box and balanced well after years of exploring this ruleset. Will also plug in Star Wars Destiny 2-player Game. Two copies will give some clashes beware the money pit of collecting this game. 
7.	Pandemic Iberia - one of the best versions of pandemic there is (next season 1, but only has a finite number of plays). More open ended options to prevent things and make things. A gorgeous game to look at with great art direction. 
8.	Ra - Has a similar feel to Camel Up but features a nice auction/push your luck mechanism that keeps everyone involved. Egyptian themed.  
9.	Samurai - A slick tile placement game where you capture pieces on the board. Has a japanese theme. Really gorgeous to look at in the end with an uniquely shaped board  
10. Rhino Hero Super Battle - Should add a dexterity game. This one is funny. You build a city of card houses and place small wooden figures on them.  I’ve considered Crokinole but too expensive. Other games I’ve considered is Loopin Louie, Flick Em Up, Junk Art, and the original Rhino Hero, but yeah. Going to go with the latest dexterity game that has my attention right now."
26633,Never played Animal Upon Animal. I’ll have to look it up. Super Battle is a nice step up from the original Rhino Hero with each player having their own hero to move each turn. Instead of building a tower you build buildings that can potentially weave into each other.
26634,Animal upon animal is a kids game. You balance sheep and toucans and stuff on an alligator. We have fun with it even though we're not kids. Sometimes we modify the rules to make it more competitive. But generally we can just get the animals stacked a lot higher because we have a better understanding of physics.
26635,"Well technically it's a kid's game but I've seen numerous adults have be a blast with it. Also there are a bunch of versions with different animals, themes, and difficulty."
26636,"Dude, Codenames Duet is my favorite by a wide margin. I can get pretty much anyone to play as they can join as learn as they go without any pressure. Also, most casuals love coop games. Everybody or nobody wins."
26637,"I own it. It didn't jive that well for me due to the nature of that instant loss (also limited time). The amount of guesses can also feel pretty slim. I don't think I gave the game a fair shake and will give the game another try down the line. It's not a game I think people should own immediately, unless they really like word games with a co-op twist."
26638,"What other comments have said are spot on...but I'm also pretty new to the scene. I don't have many games but I've had a ton of fun with Sushi GO party, Codenames and Ticket to Ride. These are pretty much gateway/introduction games but I haven't gotten bored of them."
26639,"I am a HUGE fan of **Flashpoint: Fire Rescue** for a cooperative game.

**Lords of Waterdeep** is a lot of fun (Similarly, **Stone Age** is also very good)

**Ticket to Ride** blah blah best intro game ever.

**Coup** was my favorite game until I got too deep into Flashpoint."
26640,"I asked the wifey the same question and she came up with:

**Carcassonne** (she said immediately)

**Sushi Go! Party**

**Survive! Escape From Atlantis** -- not a cooperative game, but good clean fun (killing your friends)

**Catan** (No bells and whistles, just the base set)

She agree"
26641,"So there are tons of great suggestions here, but I'm gana suggest something a bit different.

I'm gana suggest you pick up Tabletop Simulator. It's piece of software, runs on Windows or Mac, and has an MSRP of 20 bucks (but is currently 9 bucks over on humblebundle.com and is often on sale for roughly 50% off).

Basically, the software is just a good, well made physics simulator that allows you to import boards, cards, dice, pieces, etc. And a TON of retail games are available for 100% free on the Steam Workshop.

Basically, my recommendation is to pick it up and browse the Workshop for things that look interesting. Download them (the individual games are tiny downloads), load them up, maybe glance over a rulebook (which you MAY have to find a PDF online for), and find a couple that sound interesting. Then, hop into one of the various Tabletop Simulator Steam groups (you can just do a quick search and find tons), and grab some games.

It's a FANTASTIC way to ""try before you buy"" or to find things you'd otherwise never look twice at or even know exist. The software itself is REALLY easy to use (click and drag to move stuffa round, hotkeys for shuffle/cut/deal/roll/etc as well as a right click context menu for all that stuff too) and looks great. And it's cheap enough where if your real life friends want to grab a copy so you can all ""try before you buy"" together, you can easily do it without breaking the bank! The game is even often sold in a four pack.

So yeah, that's my recommendation. Hope you find some awesome games!"
26642,"I second that! Great ""game"""
26643,"**sushi go**

* Simple drafting game. Accessible theme and lots of fun. This is my wife's favorite game. 

**An abstract game**

* Santorini, Element, or Onitama. In that order. Just get one. Abstracts can be a ton of fun and those three are a great time.

**Splendor**

* Accessible tabloe builder. You are a merchant buying and selling gems. Become the best merchant you can be. It's simple, fun, and has depth.

**Co-op game**

* Theme matters a bit here. So does difficulty. The Captain is Dead is a great co-op if you want a sliding scale of difficulty and a space theme. Dead of Winter is a great co-op with a zombie theme. The Grizzled is fun but it can be a bear (and luck based). It does have a cool WW1 theme though. Hanabi is a great theme too. Fire works and such. Feels like a co-op. I guess it is? Pandemic will get brought up in this category. If you're playing with all new people, this will be fun. If you're playing with older gamers, they might be sick of pandemic (and there are so many versions to choose from).

**king of tokyo**

* It's a great dice game and an excellent light game. Psuedo Yahtzee meets single area control. What's not to love?

**Potion Explosion**

* If you liked games such as bejeweled or Candy crush, this is the board game version. And it is solid gold. Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it.

**Lords of Waterdeep**

* This is a solid worker placement game. You really can't go wrong. The only other worker placement game I would recommend is Champions of Midgard. 

**Small World**

* Truth be told, I hate this game. But I am the only person I know who dislikes the game. Mix and match all different lores, use that mix to control enough of an area to score points. 

**For Sale**

* What Monopoly distilled is. And it is fun. Auction mechanics. Bid on a property. Resell the property for a higher value.

**Resource management game**

* Most people think of Catan when this is brought up. I would like to suggest Abyss. I never really liked Catan and my friends always loved it. So I was over joyed when my friends loved Abyss. You are trying to win enough votes to become king of the depths. You get votes of various water people ( the resource cards). Then you use the votes to buy senators (points cards with special abilities). The senators help you secure sections of the depths (give you more points). It's simple to learn. It's fun. And there is always a counter strategy. Only caveat. I would not play this at 2 players. It's too easy to get ahead and stay ahead."
26644,Survive! Escape from Atlantis. That is all
26645,Just purchased this game and I love it! Played it several times over the holidays.
26646,"Here’s my list in in no particular order:

Codenames

Red7

Pandemic

Ticket to Ride

One Night Ultimate Werewolf

King of Tokyo

Vegas

No Thanks!

Monikers

Lost Cities

These games are all very simple to pickup and most people, gamer or not, will enjoy them. Covers a lot of genres and player counts. Many of these are “gateways” or “fillers”, but they will still be worth owning even after you move on to more complex games."
26647,"I think I go for different genres, since it's usually my library of games we play.

**Ticket to Ride** is a must-have.

Other than that:

* bluffing
* social deduction
* real-time
* auction
* tile-laying
* drafting
* drawing
* party game

Please remember **games go on sale**. *You don't need them right now* Go on /r/boardgamedeals or follow @Tabletop_Deals and buy the games at 30-50% off. Or wait for the Barnes & Noble clearance sale."
26648,"Just played Forbidden Island, it was a lot of fun"
26649,"It's really good.  Forbidden Desert has a similar feel, but mixes a few things up and plays different enough to give it a look if you like Island.  I like Desert a little bit better."
26650,"Interesting, I'll have to try that one. Thanks!"
26651,11. Magic the Gathering
26652,"It's good you stopped at 1, as there will be no extra income for any other games."
26653,"I feel like most of these lists are full of entry level tripe you'll play a few times and become bored with it.  Those aren't games you should own.  Those are games you want your friends or a board game club/cafe to buy.  If you're going to own a game make sure it's both deep and wide in strategy.  You want to be able to play the game over and over without getting tired of it.  The following games are all my favorites that will never leave my collection:



1. **Twilight Struggle** - the best 2 player game around.  You can play it hundreds of times and still get crushed by a pro player.  Enough luck to keep it exciting, plus tons of history learned

2. **Twilight Imperium 4** - the best 6 player conquer the universe game in existence.  Who doesn't want to smack talk with their friend for 4-10 hours.  New edition really makes the game great out of the box.

3. **Blood Rage** - the best 90 minute dudes on a map game.  Lots of replay-ability due to different combos.  Could also own Chaos in the Old World or the expensive Cthulu Wars.  This captures that spirit of game the best in the shortest play time.

4.  **Rune Wars** - if you only have 3 or 4 players this beats Ti4 for the epic game to play.  Simply the best fantasy epic game in existence.

5. **Star Wars Rebellion** w/expansion - base game was really good combat was dry.  With the expansion this is my favorite long game for 2.  Tons of choices and great Star Wars theme.

6. **Eldritch Horror** + one expansion - the base game's adventure and clue decks were too small you'd see the same card two or three times a game.  One expansion fixes all that.  This is the best coop game that isn't Pandemic.  I like it better for it's theme, luck, and mood.

7. **Three Kindoms Redux** - this is one of the best worker placement game I've played.  Only downfall is you need 3 players no less no more every time.  Great theme, wide and deep decision space.

8. **Dominant Species** - this is the king of worker placement and area control games in my book.  It should only be played with 6 players (though it works 3-6).  Feels great, tough, tough, decisions to be made each turn.  Swingy but you're never out of contention.

9. **Agricola** - this is the stress fest that makes the worker placement mechanism shine.  Why'd you take that space now Johnny is going to starve this winter!!!  

10. **Great Western Trial** - this could be replaced by Kanban or Panamax or Mediera or any other medium heavy euro.  These games are great but limited replays limits how much value you get out of them.  Perhaps I should have ended my list at 9."
26654,Yes Twilight Struggle is the best. Must have for everyone who likes 2 player games and strategy games (and history?;))
26655,You can play Twilight Struggle “hundreds of times” and not be a pro player?  This seems unlikely..:
26656,The same description could apply to chess as well.
26657,"**Saboteur** (and **Saboteur 2**, the expansion) - 3-~10 players (more with the expansion). Everyone we have introduced to loves this damn game.  Build a mine, screw over other miners, get paranoid. 2 games, just buy them both.


I think **Bring your own Book** is great - like cards against humanity but everyone has a book to find an answer to the prompt in. How clean or raunchy it is depends on players

Edit: **Red Dragon Inn** is a great 'take that"" game"
26658,"I’ll do a list that will cover various player counts, weights, and styles (the list becomes more complex as it goes):

Deep Sea Adventure

Santorini

Codenames or Codenames Duet (depending on if you want a party game for 4+ players or a 2 player game)

Century Spice Road

Whitehall Mystery

Castles of Burgundy

Race for the Galaxy

Clockwork Wars/Inis/Kemet (you pick which dudes on a map game)

Alchemists

Gaia Project"
26659,"I don't know if I could make a Top 10. But one game I really like that consistently isn't making lists here is Spyfall. 
I've played it with people who ""don't play board games"" and they have a blast trying to give really bizarre answers that divert attention. My son loves answering questions in 2 words or less. We have a lot of fun in any crowd."
26660,Carcassonne’s a classic.
26661,"My top 3 pics are:
Firefly. A board game with multiple story options to play including Solo play. One game takes an hour or so. People who don't know the TV show (if those people exist) can still enjoy this game even if they don't understand how cool it is to acquire Jane and Janes hat.

Twilight Imperium. A game of intergalactic diplomacy and war. You'll be reading the rules for a while. If you want others to play with you allow them time to read the rules or send them a link to the rules online so they can read at their leisure before coming.  One game takes one day. Start by 10am latest.

Super Dungeon Explorer. You need bare minimum 3 people playing; 2 people to be the hero adventurers and one person to be the bad guy dungeon master handling all the monsters. A great game to start people on before introducing them to Dungeons and Dragons.  

There are card games such as Dragonwood, Splendor, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens, Kittens in a blender, Gloom and Fluxx. I also recommend keeping Uno around, it has lasted the ages."

26663,"Everyone should own, at least, ten games that I don't own. Game nights would be _really_ boring if we all owned the same ten."
26664,"Dice Tower did a video about their Top Ten essential games [here.](http://www.dicetower.com/game-video/top-10-essential-games-everyone-should-own) The video is pretty long, but the games are listed below. if you want to hear more about a game, just watch that section of the video!"
26665,"I forgot to mention in my other comment, if you like Zombies then I highly recommend either **Zombicide** (specifically the Black Plague edition) and/or **Dead of Winter**. 

Zombicide is basically Left4Dead (the video game) as a board gamer. It’s cooperative and you’re placed into a city scenario with specific objectives and an escape point; Zombies continuously spawn as you search through the cities for weapons and level up as you go. Very fun, silly dice-roller. The board comes as modular tiles so there’s tons of variety in objectives & maps.

Dead of Winter is more thematic and story based. You play as survivors in a colony, trying to accomplish the mini-goal for each round while working toward the larger game-winning goal. Additionally, each player has their own secret goal and you can only win individually if you accomplish it, so you’re mostly working together but also slightly working against each other as you have differing secret goals (and sometimes a person might be the Betrayer, who can win by sabotaging the group). The gameplay is more straightforward (move to this building, draw a loot card, use a die to shoot a zombie outside) but it feels great."
26666,"I heard zombicide can become a bit too easy or samey unless you buy more enemies, is that true?"
26667,"Be VERY careful with expansions/add-ins to zombicide. Some of the added heroes make the game too easy, and you'll curb-stomp everything. 

And I wouldn't add things in until you do start to get bored. Enjoy it bit by bit then add it in."
26668,I think it's the typical CMON formula.  We'll give you 1k worth of product but we're not going to play test any of it :P
26669,"Lots of lightweight / party games. I tend to like some more brain burny games. Here are my faves:

1. Eclipse (basically risk on space with customizable ships)
2. Through the Ages - a civilization game. Pretty complex, but great fun. There's a fantastic app.
3. Race for the Galaxy - super quick card game. Basically, who can get an engine going quickest
4. Spirit Island - a coop about defending an island from European conquerers
5. Scythe - diesel punk area control
6. Agricola - build a farm while not starving
7. Bruges - card based euro. I think it's severely underrated 
8. Terraforming Mars - pretty much what it sounds like. But you're a Corp doing it for profit!
9. Tzolkin the Mayan calendar - a worker placement with a super cool giant gear!
10. Near & Far an adventure based game with a heavy narrative."
26670,"1. Codenames - an instant classic. Anyone introduced to this one catches on and clicks immediately. Also plays with large groups

2. Dominion - may have a dry theme and won't catch players immediately, but the replayability is immense It's incredibly expandable in numerous directions but the base game will last months of frequent play without any need.

3. Carcassonne - another that anyone introduced to will grab on to and become fierce competition. People become addicted to these little cardboard tiles.

4. Pandemic - the most balanced of co-op games. The game will defeat players and give them the itch to play more.

5. Cube Quest - every collection needs a dexterity game and this is easy to set up, quick to play, and incredibly simple. 

6. Chinatown - easy sell with new players ""a more refined Monopoly"" can be a miss with people who have experience working in sales might bounce off this one. 

7.  No Thanks - quick filler, easy to pick up, quick to play, people usually won't say no to a round of this while waiting on pretty much anything.

8. Tsuro - plays up to 8 people while remaining quick and simple. 

9. The Resistance - what is a game collection without a social deception game? May not be the fastest or most simple, but it's refined and elegant.

10. Dead of winter - a bit more complex than any of the others on the list, but a meaty co-op game with a traitor usually hits the mark. Zombies might not click with everyone, but the game itself is great and the crossroads provides a very unique and thematic experience."
26671,"I can't believe no one mentioned Clank!

This is the first deck builder you should own period. For me clank is a must have and I've never not had fun playing it. 

All the games listed here are good, but seriously OP if you want to get a new game the next one must be ""clank! In space"" for more replayabblity and a bit more depth (it has modular board compared to original clank!)

The game is full of tension from possible dragon/alien attacks and keeps everyone engaged because it could happen on anyone's turn"
26672,What do you think now that Clank! In Space is out?  Should I get that instead.
26673,"I think space is a better game, but original is way easier to put on the table and get someone who isn’t into board games to play."
26674,"100% get clank in space. It offers a lot more of what people wanted from the original game.

One of the biggest problems with the original was that if someone chooses to race down and grab a easy treasure and race out it can make the game feel a little rushed, but their isn't much you can do about it. A few other down falls would be less variation of maps compared to ""in space"" which has modular vs. 1 board.

With Clank in space each player has to 'hack' (activate) 2 computers in 2 of the 3 modules before they can enter the treasure room. This mission aspect makes for a much more enjoyable game and makes the game play a bit longer, but not overly long, while removing the rush strategy. It also gives you a chance to really play with the deck you build vs. the game being over before you can play most cards after acquiring. 

In addition it also adds a ton of extra features that improve the overall enjoyment of playing the game like bounty hunters, which when drawn hit all players, not just one. Another cool addition is the factions, which adds another layer to your strategy when building your deck. 

You won't be disappointed with it, I've had so many people go out and buy this game after playing it with me (i didnt even tell them to) because it's just something you'll want to have in your collection.

one last note, at it's core it's a really easy game to learn and i'd even consider it a gate way game for non games with enough depth that vet will enjoy it too."

2. Game of Thrones / Diplomacy  -People should lose friendships at my house.

3. Catan - I am a traditionalist.

4. Galaxy Truckers - Nothing says fun like ""Build a spaceship out of spare parts""

5. Scythe - So your smart friends get a turn at having no fucking clue what is happening.

6. Avalon - Find out who the biggest asshole you know is.

7. Codenames - Because you can't always predict how many players you will have.

8. Love Letter - You can bring it and play it anywhere

9. Space Alert - Playing together is only fun if you lose most of the time.

10. Dungeons and Dragons - Why stop at just board games?"
26678,"My current top 10... 
1. Pandemic. Preferably Legacy Season 1, but vanilla works just fine

2. Dominion. I adore deck builders in general, and dominion is still my favorite. 

3. Race for the Galaxy. Still one of the best Role selection games I’ve ever played. Just the right length and depth for me. I try to only play one expansion at a time. If you’ve never played this game, look up Keldon’s AI. It’s admittedly too good, and I can only beat it about 50% of the time after 2 years of playing, but it’s still one of my favorites.

4. Carcassonne. I mean it’s Carcassonne. What’s more to be said?

5. Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small. It’s a great 2 player game. Get the expansion and never play without it. It ads enough extra variety that as long as you don’t play every day, you’re good. 

6. Codenames or Codenames: Pictures. Either way is great. Currently I’d suggest pictures just b/c it’s newer to me and more exciting at the moment.

7. Bananagrams. This and Unspeakable Words are the only two word games I enjoy. Having a larger vocabulary doesn’t automatically win bananagrams for you. You need to be quick and often medium and shorter words are more useful for you. Quick silly fun.

8. Pit. It’s a classic. Certainly the oldest game in my collection (not counting my nearly exclusively decorative chess set). Plays quickly, plays a pretty wide number of players well, and it becomes raucous fun nice and quickly. 

9. Sushi Go. I recommend spending the extra 5 or 10 to get Party for the variety. Quick drafting game, fun, cute, and simple. Always a joy to play for me.

10. -Monopoly- Just kidding, gonna give this as a tie to Lanterns: The Harvest Festival and Splendor. Two simple games that I had no trouble getting my non gamer family into. Simple to play, you watch a collection of cards grow in front of you and trade in sets for a tile or a more powerful, permanent card. Look nice on the table, and those chips from Splendor are a joy to handle.

Edit. Guess I offended someone. Sorry about that"
26679,"Not in any order

Imperial Assault, tactical skirmish, rpg story and Star Wars

Mage Wars, very interesting take on Card game with tactical elements

Cosmic Encounters, just crazy backstabbing fun with friends, very simple to learn with a lot of interesting stories

Time Stories, probably the best adventure coop puzzle board game i have played, my group loves this one.

Pandemic or Pandemic Legacy, amazing game about stopping a virus from ending the world, very deep and also very simple to learn

Scythe, a really unique building type game with a lot of depth and strategy.

Werewolves or Spyfall, probably the best party deception games.

Earth Reborn, best mix of tactical mini game and board game, build your own scenarios which gives it unlimited replayability.

Carcassonne or Catan, depends on your group if you go for one or the other, but my group prefers Carcassonne.

Clank, just a really easy to learn, fun, deckbuilder.

Honorable Mentions- 

The Thing Escape From Outpost 31, my group is obsessed with this game and never have i felt so much suspense in a board game.

Runewars, very well done RTS style board game with everything in an RTS computer game in board style.

Mage Knight, awesome rpg game with a lot of depth and more to it then you can easily explain.

Havenfall, no one knows about this game but i cant recommend it enough, if you like old style adventure rpg games from the NES era then check this out.

Mysterium, awesome game basically like an advanced more interactive version of Clue.

Merchants and Marauders, this game is just great fun, and has interesting mechanics, and the best pirate themed game IMO."
26680,I was actually just looking at havenfall. Any particular reason you recommend it?
26681,"Its a really well done deck builder with an awesome theme and amazing art, and it has a lot of interesting strategies. Its very easy ti learn as well so its a good game for pretty much any one as long as they enjoy the theme."
26682,"#1 : Your favorite game

#2 : Your second favorite game

#3 : Your third favorite game

Keep going until you have no more money.

How do you find out what your favorite game is? Play other people's games. There's tons of us with tons of games that will play with you. So figure out what you like, buy boardgames that are that or like that. Because I don't think there is going to be a list of 10 games that works for everyone. Reading thru some of these other lists there are definite bias towards what that person liked. What matters is what you like."
26683,How do I play games if there are no other people playing board games and no board game stores in my country and I have to import everything?
26684,"I would recommend Settlers of Catan, Pandemic, Seven Wonders, Agricola, Codenames, Ticket to Ride, Tokaido, Sushi Go Party, Mille Bornes and Scythe as must haves. I've had so much fun playing them since day 1."
26685,"Well, I'd try to have at least one or two games in each of a few different categories:

- Party games: Time's Up and Codenames are both great, so is Catch Phrase.
- Games for new players: something really easy to teach the rules for, like 6 Nimmt / Category 5, Fairy Tale, Settlers of Catan
- ""We have all day"" games: things which take a while but are worth it, like Mage Knight, Eclipse, Too Many Bones, etc. You can plan an event around these.
- Crunchy engine builders: really there are a ton of these so just pick whatever the new hotness is. I really like Altiplano (Orleans is also great), Roads & Boats, anything by Uwe Rosenberg, anything with ""Key"" in the title.
- Cooperative games: Pandemic, Legendary: Encounters (any of them), Mechs vs. Minions, Robinson Crusoe, Big Book of Legends.
- Legacy / campaign games: if you have a set gaming group you might really like going through one of these. Gloomhaven, Pandemic Legacy, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Descent.
- Games for particular player counts: you probably want at least a couple little 2-player games, and if you like solitaire games at least one or two of those. Rose King, Onitama, that kind of thing.

Some of these obviously fit in multiple categories, like Mechs vs Minions is coop and campaign. Anyway that's my two cents! Have fun building your collection!"
26686,"A few other suggestions I haven't seen mentioned:

Smash-up: This is a tongue-in-check card-based free-for-all battle. Mash up two genres like Zombies and Pirates to make your deck and then accumulate points to score bases.

Smallworlds: An area control game (a la Risk) but without the grind (there are a set number of turns). Fantasy races combine with unique modifiers to give each player different powers and abilities."
26687,"I can't think of 10 off the top of my head but here's some of my favorites
Ascension
Acquire
Evolution
Monikers
Codenames"
26688,"The games that have been the biggest hit with my friend recently are Guillotine and Spot It.

Both are quick to learn, portable, cheap and have good replay value."
26689,"> Spot It

a.k.a. Dobble. A great filler. I think people are caught up in getting a list of ""10 best"" games, but having short fillers is essential."
26690,"**Concordia, Dominant Species, Arctic Scavengers, Great Western Trail, Puerto Rico, El Grande, Twilight Struggle, Cuba Libre, Game of Thrones, Jaipur.**"
26691,San Juan and Puerto Rico
26692,"**Who are you going to play with**

I just looked through my games and the first couple I bought have barely been touched because they are too difficult for a lot of people/take a long time and play better with 4+

Now when I want to get a game I think will I play it with my wife/friends/gamer group and can I teach it to them (most of my friends like to play games and have a few drinks so could barely manage TTR the first time we played) and how long will it take since finding 4+ hours to play Game of thrones is a challenge in itself"
26693,"*War of the Ring*

Because it's a great experience. It's only 1vs1 but it creates a story to be told. 

*Castles of Burgundy*

A modern classic that relaxes you and doesn't require much effort to explain nor to play it. 

*LotR LCG*

A challenging coop with wonderful artworks and many different scenarios."
26694,"Interested in board games? Well I can give you a list that will give you a deep dive into a wonderful and amazing hobby, starting with games which are easier to get into.

ONE Pandemic

Players act together to save the world in this game where only cooperation will let you survive. Plays in about an hour.

TWO: Ticket to Ride

Build train routes across America and cash in your tickets for game-winning points. Also takes about an hour and comes with many plastic trains.

THREE: Splendor

Compete against other jewellers hoping the win the favour of a noble patron. Plays in less than an hour.

FOUR: Sagrada

Dice drafting game where you are making an intricate stained glass display. Fun game for 2-4 players which will be unpacked, played, and packed away again within an hour.

FIVE: Lords of Waterdeep 

Okay, let's get used to the concept of agent placement, using this D&D themed game. A 60-90 minute game, depending on whether eveyone involved has played this before.

SIX: Tzolk'in the Mayan Calendar

Worker placement meets planning ahead in this fun game about being a Mayan. Game last for one revolution of the wheel, or about 90 minutes.

SEVEN: Tsuro

Let's calm thing down a bit with this game for 2-8 players, which will be over quickly but leave you looking forward to the next challenge.

EIGHT: Caverna: the Cave Farmers

Hope you enjoyed that break because now it's time for a deeper dive into a strategic game where luck takes a back seat to planning. Expensive to buy and long to play, this game is much loved by experienced board game players.

NINE: Terraforming Mars

This strategy game has a SF feel, and again rewards planning over luck.

TEN: Terra Mystica

Top of many people's lists, leave this game until later, and better yet find some experienced players to help you through the first game or two.

*it's numbered 1-10 in my preview but not where anyone else can see it? whatever reddit code."
26695,"There will always be bias, so this is my list. 
 
* Onitama (2p abstract) 
* Siam (2p abstract) 
* Jaipur (2p card game) 
* The Resistance (party social deduction game)
* Love Letter (party social deduction game) 
* Masmorra: Dungeon of Arcadia (multi-player dungeon dweller, multi-usage game: co-op and competitive)
* Istanbul (multi-player competitive worker placement)
* Kodama (multi-player competitive card game)
* Tokaido (multi-player competitive worker placement)
* Scythe (multi-player Ameritrash) 
 
I have a combination of gateway, filler, and more complicated game."
26696,"1. **Rise of Augustus** - Easy to teach, plays fast, scales well between 1-6. First time gamers have no trouble picking it up and veterans can find enjoyment in it too.

2. **Lords of Waterdeep** - Intro to Worker Placement. Can play 6 with the expansion though is probably best between 2-4. Dungeons and a Dragons theme can catch the eye of role players should they come over.

3. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - Plays good at 4-5 and great at 6-11. Social Deduction, but short rounds and always seems to get everyone involved.

4. **Junkart** - Dexterity game that plays great at 2-5(6?) players. Each round has a slightly different mechanic to keep things interesting. Also teaches some concepts like Card Drafting.

5. **Clank! In! Space!** - Fairly easy to learn Deckbuilder that is fun at all Player counts. Could be replaced with the original if that’s cheaper/a more palatable theme.

6. **Inis** - was going to put **Blood Rage** as I like that game better, but Inis plays better at 2 and is great at 3 and 4. This teaches dudes on the map and really enforces Card Drafting.

7. My Number 7 is going out on a limb: **Exodus Fleet**. Great Role Selection and Auction game that plays well at 2-4. For a more tested game with the auctioning mechanic, pick up **Ra** instead.

8. **Azul** - Pretty Abstract that plays well between 2-4. Also can be played nicely or mean and seems to get better with more experience.

9. **Ghost Stories** - Caveat: I like my Co-ops to be hard, and this one seems to be the best at that without becoming frustrating. Plays best at 1 and 4 so may need to be replaced with **Pandemic** if you will be playing mostly with 2-3 players, though Ghost Stories is not bad at these counts, just not the best.

10. The Deep End Game: **Scythe**, **Great Western Trail**, etc. that mixes a bunch of the mechanics of your easier titles and presents you with an experience that the more gateway titles can’t replicate."
26697,"My favorites :

1. Terra Mystica (my fav)
2. 7wonders (most played)
3. Bohnanza
4. Takenoko
5. Code Names (perfect party game)
6. Love letter
7. Dead of winter (best coop game with pandemic)
8. The resistance :Avalon (secret identites - another great party game)
9. Bang
10. Catan"
26698,"Catan - It is a classic trading game/gathering game. It is great for people who haven't really played big board games before. Also as an introduction to board games beyond Monopoly.

Zombicide Black Plague - This is the fantasy version and is much better rules than the modern day one. This one can scratch the RPG itch easily.

Eclipse - Is an excellent(and complex) 4x board game. We play this at least once every time our group gets together. Massive space exploration and every turn is laden with choices sometime difficult ones.

Sushi-go - This is a great drafting game to get matches and points. Fun for all ages, though a card game...

Tsuro - Fun little game, very simple rules. Placing tiles to move your guy around and trying to move your opponents off the board.

El Grande - Is a good game where you are vying for political influence of areas. No combat, just placing tokens and playing cards to disrupt your opponents influence. Nice Area Control game.

Massmorra/Arcadia Quest - Massmorra is a dungeon delving game where tiles are randomly drawn to build the dungeon. Your heroes level up and gain abilities to aid in defeating the big bad guy. Solo play and VS included. Arcadia quest is a squad game, where your 3 Heros(guild) are competing with other guild for gear/money/exp to level up. In the campaign you work ""together"" to progress(or compete to get better stuff) and the final boss fight you team up and the guild with the most points at the end wins. I listed these together because the characters/models are interchangeable. Same universe.

Forbidden Island - Neat game where you stranded on an Island and have to gather relics before you can leave. Gets much harder at higher player counts.

Tiny Epic .... - any of them are great fun in small packaging. Most people seem to like the Western and Galaxies one. I prefer the Kingdoms one. (though, to be fair I haven't played the western one yet)

Axis and Allies - This is a war games based on WWII for 2-5 players. Well made and historically accurate starting positions. Certain situations the rules can be complex; but, mostly the rules are rather simple.

For me these are the games I would say are my top ten. Cover a good bit of ground and genres. I would be up for playing any of these at almost any time."
26699,"To try to cover the most mechanics, and to gateway into deeper games, I present this list:

Catan
Ticket to Ride
Dominion
Splendor
D-Day Dice or One-Deck Dungeon
Axis & Allies 1941
Carcassonne
Risk
Pandemic
Lords of Waterdeep"
26700,"1. *Suburbia* or *Castles of Mad King Ludwig*
2. *Sushi Go*
3. *7 Wonders* or *7 Wonders Duel*
4. *Pandemic*
5. *Alien Frontiers*
6. *Viticulture* or *Lords of Waterdeep*
7. *Lost Cities*
8. *Dixit* or *Codenames*
9. *Flamme Rouge* or *Snow Tails*
10. *Smallworld*"
26701,"Some good lists in here. I would say a good starter kit is **Codenames**, **Ethnos**, and **Forbidden Desert**. Accommodates a wide range of player counts, givers you a good entry point to several different genres that are still regularly enjoyed in my collection, and has a diversity of theme so you aren't playing the same thing over and over again."
26702,"Adding my own list as I was surprised to see some games omitted.

**1: Sushi Go Party:** An introduction to drafting games that's easy to teach. I've had better luck bringing this out with new players compared to **7 Wonders**, which is definitely a great take on the genre.

**2: Ticket to Ride: Europe:** Much more interesting than the base game without being overly complex.

**3: Bohnanza:** I haven't really played a game that encourages open trading the same way Bohnanza does. Simple to teach also.

**4: Kingdomino:** Simple tile-laying game that's very satisfying to play. Not as overwhelming as **Carcassonne** can be to newer players.

**5: Dominion:** The king of deck-builders with plenty of room for expansion.

**6: YINSH:** My choice of abstract; attracts a lot of attention on the table, simple to teach yet extremely engaging.

**7: Cosmic Encounter:** A little more complex than other games on the list, but provides an excellent experience of space politics.

**8: Deception: Murder in Hong Kong:** My 6+ player game of choice. Very simple to pick up, and can cause the table to explode with accusations and theories.

**9: Codenames:** Fun wordplay game that's a crowdpleaser.

**10: Specter Ops:** Something with a longer playtime that's incredibly intense, while pulling off the stealth genre in board game form."
26703,"**Keyflower** - A bidding worker placement game that works at all player counts. Balance using your workers as currency to expand your town, using actions on any visible tile, and possibly giving your opponent more workers next round.

**Eclipse** - Heavy euro 4x space game. Might not be best for someone just getting into the hobby, but it is a game you should have.

**Roll for the Galaxy** - Dice game where you roll some dice and build a space empire. Plays fast, and is fairly easy to learn.

**Seasons** - Card drafting and dice rolling combined into a really great game. Collect energy to play the cards you drafted to build an engine to get the most points.

**Viticulture** - Card driven worker placement game about making wine. It has a really cool, simple mechanic for getting grapes and turning them into wine.

**Suburbia** *or* **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - I'd say either game is great depending on your theme preference. I actually prefer the city building theme in Suburbia, but Castles did make some things play a little better. Score points for building the best city/castle.

**Taluva** - This might be my favorite abstract game. Build a 3D island out of volcanoes and be the first one to build up your island city. 

**Star Realms** - Fantastic deckbuilding game that plays in no time. Also a good intro to deckbuilding if you haven't played any.

**Lanterns** - Great, simple tile laying game. I never was a huge fan of Carcassone, visually or mechanically, so this was an easy replacement.

**Agricola** - The game is a mile deep with all of the different possible card options. It needs to be there simply because of replayability."
26704,"Secret hitler would be worth $500 to me, so much value from that game."
26705,"Catan!

There's so many good ones out there but I love Catan. I think it should make everyone's top 10 list but we all got different opinions. 

You'd have to spend so much money to experience all these games. I recommend renting then from a libaray or asking friends if they have any and trying them out!"
26706,"I really like, Catan (all versions) and the resistance. Super fun!"
26707,"1. Codenames - great party game, except 2 people need to be mostly silent is the only downside.
2. Splendor - very simple card builder, best with 3 players
3. Zany Penguins - chaotic card game for 3-5 players
4. Lords of Vegas - lots of luck in this one
5. Catan - vanilla is best
6. Suburbia - city building, best with 3 players, most complex game in this list
7. Acquire - stock trading game, it can get really dramatic
8. Glux - very simple rules, harder to master
9. Good Cop Bad Cop - chaotic social deduction related game
10. Kingdomino - easygoing domino game"
26708,"Get “Sorry”, friendships have been put to the test with this game of spite. Can remember playing this in elementary/junior high when it was too cold to go outside, develops profane vocabulary while devolving relationships if you’re into that sort of thing. Worth a shot nonetheless!"
26709,"This would have been a perfect opportunity for an April Fools Prank. 

How did Monopoly move into position #1?!"
26710,"... well, shit"
26711,"I thought with Gloomhaven at #1 it was already a prank.

26713,"This list is compiled from the ratings of members of the [Redditors Guild](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1290) on Board Game Geek using an algorithm that is broadly similar to the one used to compile the BGG scores. 

If you want to have your ratings reflected in this list, sign up for BGG and join the guild - that's it!

Also I made a decision to only compile these once a quarter. The list just doesn't change enough from month to month to be worthwhile. So this reflects change to the list since the beginning of the year and you can look for the next one on or about July 1st!"
26714,"Is Castles of Burgundy's new edition worth it a ""second"" slot? I thought it was the same game"
26715,"I don't make the rules about whether a game gets an entry on BGG, unfortunately. That said, I do think there are some minor differences. They changed a tile or two, I know that much."
26716,"Same with Twilight Imperium (3rd and 4th), although there might be a bigger difference between those two."
26717,"Got my hands on a copy of mech vs minions and finally got a chance to play last night. Unbelievable game, absolutely loved it. 

At first we thought it was impossibly hard and we couldn't understand how we could possibly beat the scenarios, but when we realized the infinite possibilities each turn it just became incredibly rewarding each and every turn."
26718,"I have only played inis once, via TTS and even then it was one of the best games I have ever played."
26719,Clearly you reddit folk are the best of the best.  Spirit Island in the top 5 where it belongs.
26720,"Gotta admit I was wrong. I used to think Gloomhaven was overhyped and over recommended when compared to other similar games.

I just got Jaws of the Lion, and it honestly blew me away with how good it is. I get it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s fine, but I now understand why it’s so widely regarded and recommended. Kind of sad now I missed on on Frosthaven’s KS, but if I understand correctly, the preorder is still open :)"
26722,"Maybe I’m forgetting some components, but $50 seems pretty inline for what I would expect for a game that size"
26723,"With games nowadays pushing the needle towards $100, this is an absolute bargain for everything crammed inside this box."
26724,"MSRP wise this would be $70-$80 i feel for other games with similar component contents. Terraforming Mars, Descent JotD, and Spirit island are all in 70-80 SRPs.  Maybe the miniatures or the extra plastic increase costs highly.

Dominion is $45 and that is like if Jaws of the Lion was nothing but cards."
26725,"When the inital preorders for it came out at Miniature Market and GameNerdz, I remember them selling it for $35."
26726,"IIRC, Target asked for a <$40 product, but they argued it up to $50."
26727,"Ha, i had an inkling at my store $40 was the sweet spot for hot sellers, so i am glad my hunch possibly matches Target's years and billlions of data points.     

Games like Splendor, Azul, Century Spice Road all hit the $40 US spot making them better sellers at our store than $50 games."
26728,It is probably more a matter of Target ensuring enough volume that the economics of scale allows for that price.
26729,"I was the same way, I watched various reviews and was like “Eh, seems like an okay dungeon crawler.”

Then a friend in a different city suggested we try it out in TTS. We played enough to both retire a character and then restarted the campaign with another friend. We recently added a fourth player and finished the “main” storyline. 

At some point, I began to feel bad that I was getting so much entertainment from the game without having paid for it. I didn’t actually want a physical copy of the game because I didn’t think my wife would ever actually play it with me. So when the Frosthaven campaign came out, I used the no reward option to give the creator some money. 

But then Jaws of the Lion came out and I thought I would take a chance to see if my wife would like it. Turns out, she loves it. A few plays into it, I joked “Maybe I should actually back Frosthaven” and she said “Wait a minute, I’m not actually getting upset at that idea...” but at that point, the pledge manager was closed. Thankfully it opened back up a month later for wave 2!

Yesterday, my wife said Gloomhaven was her favorite game and we finally painted our miniatures too."
26730,Plus the whole Gloomhaven brand is a burgeoning juggernaut. There'll always be other chances.

26732,What is an L Index?
26733,"I feel that way about frost haven as well, at t he same time jaws is the perfect game for me. Frost haven is just to much, much like the original game. I am more so hoping to see either expansion content for jaws, or another product like it."
26734,I don’t see patchwork-in shrink on here so it isn’t  a valid list ;-)
26735,"Ah, shit. I almost got away with it, too."
26736,"I find it weird how heavy this list, when the majority of the posts are geared towards medium to light games.  Not a bad list by any means, but I would of never guessed it."
26737,"I would guess that the people who rate games on BGG probably favor heavier games in general, vs someone just subbed here"
26738,Thanks for posting this!
26739,I've got my first game of twilight imperium this week on tabletop sim. Super excited to play that game looks incredible. Learning the rules took forever and I'm in charge of teaching everyone so I hope I get it right.
26740,Practice your teach. Set up the game and hear yourself as you go through your mental outline. It really helps a lot.
26741,I think that's good advice thanks.
26742,Shut Up and Sit Down did a video very recently on how to teach a board game. You might find it useful.
26743,"I would strongly advise that you make your players watch this video. TI4 takes forever to teach, especially if you’ve never done it before. Using this instead is the best resource and we make anyone new to playing with our group watch it ahead of time. 


https://youtu.be/_u2xEap5hBM"
26744,"Hey man! I have 50+ games and constantly contribute to rules questions in the discord. Hit me up and if I'm available you can ask me all your rules questions directly.

TI is my favorite game of all time."
26745,Hey that's super nice of you! If it's the space cats discord I'll definitely use that as a resource. Otherwise I might keep hold of all our big questions after our first session on Monday and send you ones we cant find the answer to.
26746,"Scpt and the ti4 discord are good. 

Good luck for your first game!"
26747,This top 100 is so much better than BGGs.
26748,"The Crew... wow rose 22 spots. Oh this is the game Zee really liked, I should pick this up! Trick taking game.......... nvm."
26749,"Crokinole jumping up 5 slots is pretty out there, considering how luxurious that game is to buy."
26750,"It's my favourite game by far, and I'm always tooting its horn: **Hanabi**. Simple cooperative card game that does not suffer from the so-called 'alpha gamer' problem. You can find copies for 10$ online, 15$ in local stores; one of the cheapest games I own, and has been played dozens of times.

In the card game category, **Citadels** is called an evergreen for good reasons; simple to understand, carries easily. Medium-weight, but a classic in my group.

If you're at all into abstract games, **Hive** is *the* modern abstract game (with **The Duke** coming in at a close second). Absolute must have for chess and checkers lovers looking to diversify.

If you (plan to) do a lot of 1-on-1 gaming, I'd argue both **Android: Netrunner** and **Summoner Wars** (either the Master Set or the upcoming Alliances Master Set) are must-haves (but their themes might not appeal to everybody).

If you're into large group games, or host 8-12 people often, **Mascarade** plays wonderfully well in those late evenings where the party dies down. Another 20$ that got tons of mileage.

A well-rounded collection would likely include one or two gateway games, to hook new gamers: **Takenoko**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Alhambra** or a coop like **Pandemic** (especially in it's **Pandemic: The Cure** form: much less think-y, much more approachable by non-gamers)."
26751,"Adding Hanabi and Android: Netrunner to my ""To buy"" list. I will research on others, thanks!"
26752,"It depends on whether you'd like to satisfy your needs or your group's needs. 

""The beginner's box"" IMO should include : 

Pandemic, 

A Drafting game/card game (7 wonders, Sushi Go,etc.)

A Worker Placement (Keyflower, Agricola, Pillars Of The Earth,etc.)

A LCG (Netrunner, Game Of Throne), 

A dice game (Quarriors, Quantum, Alien Frontier,etc.), 

A more interactive/social game (Resistance, One Night Ultimate Werewolf,etc.), 

A 4X (Clash Of Cultures, Eclipse, Civilization,etc.)

A deckbuilder (Ascension, Legendary, Shadowrun, Dominion,etc.) 

Some fillers (Games that take 10 to 20 minutes to play)

and An Epic Game (Diplomacy, Runewars, Twilight Imperium,etc.)"
26753,How do you like Resistance? I've heard good things.
26754,"It's great. Avalon is the same but a bit better, I'd recommend going with that"
26755,"My group played both many times and generally liked Avalon better. The main difference is that instead of special cards providing extra knowledge, there are special good and evil *roles* that come with special knowledge from the beginning -- so you have to try to convey your knowledge subtly to your comrades. Having an interesting permanent identity feels more organic to me."
26756,"It's a great social game. Tons of players interaction, Simple rules and the game is super cheap (10-20$). I sold mine a couple months ago because my gaming group has been reduced significantly (Resistance is 5 players min.)

Avalon seems great but i haven't played it yet."
26757,"I've seen people recommend Game of Thrones LCG before, but what I've played of it seemed very slow and complicated. Also, I tend to have no characters when my boyfriend has about 20 (he normally plays stark). Am I just bad at it? Or does it get a lot better with expansions?"
26758,"The only ""must have games"" are the ones you'll play. Every game can be the best value, if you enjoy it.

I can laminate how good Terra Mystica is, but if it's not a game you'd get played, it isn't a good recommendation. 

I can suggest Hanabi for a good value, but if you or the people you play with don't like the limitations on communication, it isn't a good value

If possible, I'd recommend visiting a local game store, and trying out games in their demo section. Figure out what you like, and what you think can hit the table."
26759,"I'm sorry, I'm just having a giggle over here trying to imagine how one laminates praise for a game.

But, seriously, to OP: **Terra Mystica** is the #2 game on BGG for a reason. It's a heavy Euro-style game, but it's a seriously amazing game that takes many of the same social interaction and area control aspects of Settlers and blows it up to an epic scale while still maintaining a fairly comprehensible rules set. It's a very complex game, but not a complicated one."
26760,"To OutlierJoe's point, Terra Mystica is a great game, but won't we everyone's cup of tea. You certainly can't bust it out with a bunch of newbie boardgamers - their eyes will glaze over a few minutes into the very long teach. I played it once, recognized its worth, but I won't acquire it for my collection as I don't think I'll be able to get it to the table enough."
26761,"Via my laminating machine.

I write letters saying how much I love something, print it, and laminate it to keep it safe for the years to come."
26762,"I agree with others that the only ""must have"" games are which you have played which you have personally decided you must have.

But here are some games I have which almost everyone enjoys (and which many people on reddit also recommend, so it's not just my friends), which aren't on your buy list, so you might try playing them and decide if you must have them:

**Bohnanza** is a simple card game of trading and selling beans. The game gives you strong motivation to trade -- sometimes you're willing to trade something away for free just to get rid of it -- so it's more interactive and friendly than **Catan**. It's small, cheap, 2-7 people can play, and even your grandparents will enjoy it.

**Power Grid** is an auction and network building game with a high ratio of depth to rules. It's fairly easy to learn and very strategic. Although I've never heard anyone dispute that it's a well-designed game, the mental arithmetic it requires isn't fun for everyone, so try before you buy.

**Jaipur** is a card game of trading and selling for two people. It's simple but still presents you with difficult decisions. Highly recommended for couples, since it's not too confrontational but still competitive.

**Pandemic** is *the* classic cooperative game of racing to cure diseases and prevent outbreaks. It's great to discover the strategy with a group of friends over several plays. After a while if you decide you've mastered it, there are expansions to increase the challenge or let you play the evil mastermind against your inexperienced friends.

**Acquire** is a classic stock buying game. It's elegant and balanced, and  it feels like a euro from the 90s as opposed to an american game from the 60s (which it is). If you get into this genre you'll probably find other more complex games you like more, but this is one that's easy to learn and still enjoyable after years of playing.

**The Resistance** is a party game of accusation and lying. The rules are incredibly minimal and provide just enough framework to build arguments around. You'll be surprised to learn which of your friends are good liars. Frankly there's not a whole lot of strategy to the game and you might get tired of it after a while but it's still (I think) the game with the highest ratio of fun to simplicity in the genre.

**Coup** is a light bluffing game for 2-6. Despite the core mechanic of lying, there is a surprising amount of strategy. It's great to fill those gaps of time while waiting for people to arrive or between longer games."
26763,"7 wonders is great! Forbidden dessert is a good co-op, not as involved as Pandemic but still good."
26764,Player counts?  Favorite themes?  Situations where you'll be gaming?
26765,"Cheap games that are amazing:
- **Love letter**
- **Hanabi**
- **Skulls**
- **Resistance** or **Avalon**
- **Star Realms**
- **Machi Koro**
- **Battle Line**
- **Aton**
- **Jaipur**

Must Haves:
- **7 Wonders**
- **Pandemic**
- **Caverna** (updates **Agricola**)
- **Dominion** (will also need at least 1 expansion though)
- **Ticket to Ride**
- **Power Grid**

Personal Favorites:
- **Twilight Struggle**
- **Eclipse** (terribly long setup time though)
- **Netrunner** (though this is a hobby on its own)
- **Game of Thrones boardgame**
- **Dominant Species**


Also do not underestimate the wallet draining effect of buying into Fantasy Flight games (Netrunner, X-Wing, Arkham Horror). They go mad with expansions and you will want them all!"
26766,I hear Caverna is more samey (no random element with cards). Would you really consider it a strict upgrade?
26767,"I personally like it better because there is less stress and more of a complete farm feeling earlier on.

I guess its a matter of preference and some will like the stress element of Agricola better."
26768,"Why will dominion need at least 1 expansion?  Just bought it, never played. Need to know what you mean by that"
26769,"Aside of the fact that expansions give variety that is soon appreciated after playing base game for a few games, they also allow for more interesting combo's that are not present in the base game.

Its a game that is good with base but really shines with at least 1 expansion."
26770,"Depends on the crowd. Getting into gaming? Catan, ticket to ride, Carcassonne. Next level up, 7 wonders, dc deck building, betrayal at house on the hill. Intense gamer? Game of thrones, Spartacus,  Agricola."
26771,"Adding Ticket to ride, Agricola and 7 Wonders to my ""To buy"" list. I will research on others, thanks!

I played 7 wonders yesterday and I found it be fun. I didn't finish last!"
26772,"There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's in my top 5 of all time. Love it."
26773,"Yup, other players had to explain me a lots of things while playing the game."
26774,[Watch It Played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Wfdn5Es8U) has a really good tutorial and sample gameplay videos for 7 Wonders. It helped me learn/teach the game.
26775,"I'd recommend Caverna over Agricola. Bit pricey but it was the Agricola killer for me. Bought mine on sale for $62. My gaming group, who love Agricola, say Caverna is their favorite game we have played to date."
26776,"Is spartacus that complex? Been thinking about getting it and BGG says the weight of it is only ""2.7"" which is a weight I'm comfortable with..."
26777,"Not terribly, but it's harder than most, at least at first. Most people just get lost in the explanation, but after playing one round people will understand it, if they last. I put it up there because you have to like long gameplay and you have to be able to be fine with a lot of initial rules. I've a taught a [very intelligent] 11 year old, but I've had grown men say it's too much."
26778,"If you're looking for Value, card games are the way to go.

Star Realms is a great two player deck builder, head to head combat, with a quick play time, amazing replayability, easy to learn, and maybe best of all, it's like $15.

As someone mentioned, Bohnanza is great fun, light hearted table politics.

I see Agricola on your to buy list, but maybe look into Caverna instead. Agricola was the first really heavy game we got, and we still play it, but Caverna is usually our pick of the two.

But when we really feel like digging in, we bring out Terra Mystica. Such a fun game, I love the energy mechanic, all the races are similar enough that your comfortable drawing a player board at random, but are different enough to make them feel distinct. Expensive, but this is probably the game we've gotten the most enjoyment per dollar from.

Games like Xwing and Legendary or Netrunner can be great fun, but may end up draining your wallet.

For party games, One Night Ultimate Werewolf and The Resistance: Avalon are always hits, Sheriff of Nottingham is a recent hot game, and the classic Cards Against Humanity, if that fits your group's setting."
26779,"Definitely add:

**Cash n' Guns** to your list.  It is an amazingly fun 4-8 player social/bluffing game which includes foam guns in the box for pointing at your friends to rob them of loot you stole.  Always a good time.

**Machi Koro** is another new gateway game. A great Japanese city builder.  Can be taught in less than 5 minutes. 

**Lords of WaterDeep** - a fun worker placement game.

**Smash Up** - excellent competitive card game where you pick 2 factions and smash them together into your deck and fight over area control.  Tons of variety with constant expansion.  My wife beats me every time."
26780,Tichu is the best value for money game I know of.
26781,"Cannot recommend 7 Wonders enough. Also, Carcassonne. 

Some favorite quick ""filler"" games of my group: Love Letter, Tsuro

Get a good worker placement game... Some of my faves include Lords of Waterdeep, Manhattan Project, and Russian Railroads.

A great euro that gets a lot of bang for the buck is Castles of Burgundy.

Another one that sees a lot of table time for us is Power Grid."
26782,"I really, really like Betrayal at the House on Haunted Hill and the Game of Thrones game, but both can be very lengthy and convoluted. 

Guillotine is probably my favorite simple game, as it is competitive but not ""I hate you"" inducing and it has a fun art style and concept."
26783,"I've never failed to have a good time with **Shadow Hunters**. In fact, the game is so good that I kept playing it with different friends who bought their own copies immediately afterwards. It's best with 6-8, it's pretty quick and light, there's some deduction and strategy, and best of all there are usually some hilarious card interactions, ""stand up dice roll"" moments and at least one surprising twist when someone reveals an unexpected identity. It's like a lighthearted Resistance. 7 Wonders is a good game for a similar number of people if they are serious enough gamers too handle the dry, cerebral, spreadsheet scoring type gameplay, but **Shadow Hunters** is a blast in comparison."
26784,"Must own is so hard to say for other players since it's personal, but like others have said, it should be something that you love and can play regularly. 

In my case, I don't have the time to play long games, I own and love **Eclipse**, but it's probably leaving the collection because I only play once a year or so. 

For me personally, my collection would be incomplete if I didn't also own **Carcassonne**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Ticket to Ride**, and **Diamonds**

If you play 2 player head to head games I'd recommend **Jaipur**

If you have parties, I also consider **Time's Up: Title Recall** and **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** to be essential."
26786,"Its funny because half of these are totally reasonable games you can actually get to the table in a wide variety of situations and have fun and half of these are totally ""im gonna buy this and fantasize about getting it to the table because THAT would be awesome""/""i played this once and it was awesome"""
26787,I wonder if it would be possible to look at the guilds top played games. I wonder how it would compare to the top rated games.
26788,"I thought about it, but people log plays even less consistently than they rate games. But if someone was really interested in giving it a shot I say go for it."
26789,half? The only one I see any trouble getting to the table is TI4. Everything else seems reasonable.
26790,"If that is honestly your experience, awesome!!!!!

Do you realllllllly think most people are as lucky as you though?? ....because they aren't"
26791,"Cult of the 2014-18, lol"
26792,I only own three of those games and one of them was given to me as a gift. I don't know if that makes me out of touch or an iconoclast :)
26793,"Damn, big gains by Eclipse!"
26794,"This sub sure swings heavy, huh?

Also, yay spirit Island, suck it JOTL."
26795,"From what I've seen most lists like this skew heavy. Seems the venn diagram of ""invested enough to make a top 100"" and ""likes uno"" is two circles."
26796,"For real. I think the lightest game on here is TTR. Not unexpected given this sub. Also this sub really hates Catan.

I think the concern I have is someone new to the hobby comes to this sub looking for that next game. Not sure spirit island or war of the ring would be the way to go."
26797,"Keep in mind, this is a list from some more “hard core” gamers. It’s not reflective of the sub at large, just a small subset of people who are subscribed to the guild on BGG and have rated their games on BGG as well. 

Calling it “The Sub’s” Top 100 is definitely overstating its case. It’s an interesting exercise every month, but that’s about it."
26798,How do I get included in this? I think we need more than 6 or 7 games that casual gamers can enjoy.
26799,[Join the guild](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1290) on BGG and rate the games in your collection there.
26800,I think the honor for lightest game on the list goes to Codenames.
26801,"To be fair I think Catan is just super dated. I know lots of people still love it and there's a bit of nostalgia for it still with myself as well but so many games do what Catan does but better now. And there's also much better games for getting people into the hobby now. Ticket to ride is my personal favorite game to get people into the hobby. Pandemic has always been pretty excellent and the theming is more relevant than ever.


I don't think I'd ever recommend someone pick up Catan now unless you already love it."
26802,I guess that’s true…. Still love me some cities and knights though.
26803,"I really like player interaction that isn't direct combat. Catan has tones of player interaction that I love. Its also simple to teach and beginners pick it up easily. Ill play it anytime.  The worst game of Catan I ever had was when someone managed to control all the wheat that wasnt a 2 or 12.  He became the target of every robber. It caused the game to crawl. But you know it created a lot of yelling and funny memories. A table full of people yelling over the robber, constantly losing half your cards, constant debates of what a fair trade looks like.  Not many games could recreate that experience."
26804,"Every game on here I really like or at least see the appeal of it if I don't like it.

But I will never understand why people enjoy Food Chain Magnate so much. I just don't get it."
26805,"I used to share this opinion (and also like brass birmingham, though), but playing with the new milestones made me enjoy it slightly more, though I don't think its the best game of all time or anything.

I recommend you check out the pax series of games as well, similar enough, but way better."
26806,"Ditto, but swap FCM for Brass Birmingham!"
26808,"BARRAGE HYPE TRAIN IS ALL GAS, NO BRAKES"
26809,"It's amazing to see keyflower getting so much love, surrounded by much flashier games but holding its own"
26810,I just don't get the insane love for GH
26811,"I played through 90 or so scenarios with my wife. It was a hoot! Dungeon delving, new scenarios, skin of your teeth wins and losses, what’s not to love?

I would never try to play it with 3 other non family members. I could never trust that kind of commitment."
26812,"I'm with you. Even people I know who like the theme and type of game admit that they ""never"" table it because of the setup and the overall dedication required."
26813,"A lot of people I know who liked it at first got bored of it as well, or sick of the setup or just wanted to move onto something else.

I get the design is good but the story is pretty bland and generic and it's a fiddly beast that takes ages to set up and play. Just doesn't seem like it would have such wide appeal"
26814,"I am right there with you. 

I played with a group for a few years. It had moments of fun, but while I enjoyed spending time with those PEOPLE, I don’t think I really enjoyed the game much. It felt so samey EVERY time. And if it didn’t, those were rare. The setup SUCKED and the lore/campaign was really poorly done. 

I think it is a fine game with lots of content and some fun puzzles to solve, but not 27-30 3-hour-plays of said fun."
26815,"Was very interested in how an established game like Puerto Rico could drop 21 spaces. 

[Q1 Entry](https://i.imgur.com/NWZkFit.png)

[Q2 Entry](https://i.imgur.com/HRWhLoY.png)

The description and vote totals don't seem consistent.

Edit: the links in the list indeed go to two different listings of Puerto Rico. Doesn't seem like this should be considered a true drop."
26816,"If anything the previous entry is listed too high. When the same game was effectively listed twice I'd just keep whichever one was highest on the list, but this time I took the time to blend the votes and ratings."
26817,"Wow, no Eldritch Horror? It feel like i am the only one who knows about the game. I never see it in groups but its tons of fun."
26818,It's #87 on BGG.
26819,"It's a well known game in the board game community.   Top 100 will exclude a lot of games, no matter the list"
26820,I find so many that enjoy boardgames and similar hobbies who have never heard of it. Its just plain odd honestly.
26821,"The best part of this is that I've only heard of 7 out of your 20 -- time for some games research!  2020 is like the lost year :)

Thank you, great list and writeup!"
26822,I've heard of 14
26823,Grats
26824,"Eclipse Second Dawn is fantastic. Probably my favorite game of the year so far, and I've played most on your list. Easy to learn, lots of strategy, just a fantastic game."
26825,"Yeah I own it, just need to schedule a game day for it to dive in, probably an all-afternoon or all-evening type of game I think?"
26826,Depends on number of players. We did a 5 player game in about 3 hours with learning. It's not as long as I thought it would be.
26827,"1. Nice list! You do play a lot of games, not sure I managed 20 different ones last year.
2. OOooo Faiyum. Im debating (in my head) if I should get rid of Concordia in favour of this. Not much of a euro player (my favourites being Age of Steam and the 2 Brasses), and this looks to be more to my liking.
3. 18Chesapeake is my 2020 favourite. It was my first 18XX play and I was so happy with how it went that I started making an app for 18XX games. Now I consider myself ""a 18XX player"".  Will probably get my self to some train convention once things clear up."
26828,"Well usually I play more with local meetups and local conventions. Faiyum definitely doesn’t replace Concordia in any way, the only similarity is playing one card a turn and taking a turn to gain your cards back. It’s definitely more interactive than the race elements in Concordia."
26829,Running a campaign with my wife for Gloomhaven JOTL and we are loving it. Great game and now that we’ve gotten the swing of things it’s quite addicting. She’s playing Red Guard and I’m Hatchet and it’s a blast.
26830,"How many missions is jaws of the lion and how representative is it of the full versions of the game?

I'm interested in buying it to play with my girlfriend to test the waters for frosthaven but wondering if you could give some insight"
26831,Around 25 missions compared to GH's 90ish missions. It's pretty much Gloomhaven light. Setup is more streamlined (no tiles like base GH) and there is less variety but overall very representative and true to original GH. It's a perfect test to see if the game is for you.
26832,I've played OG gloomhaven on boardgame simulator but think I'd love getting a proper copy for frosthaven. Just want to make sure my girlfriend likes it too!
26833,JotL has 25 scenarios versus Gloomhaven’s ~100 scenarios. It’s very much just a shorter campaign with the same gameplay/depth as Gloomhaven. I think it’s a perfect primer for Frosthaven.
26834,25 scenarios is honestly longer than I expected. Thanks for answering my query and will definitely look to pick it up at some point!
26835,"There are 25 scenarios in the booklet but you will play through about 15-17 in a campaign I think, and the first 4 are basically the tutorial. Still well worth the money though."
26836,"Man, I'm new to this hobby and didn't realise so many games were always coming out! It's a little intimidating tbh, the thought of having so many classics to catch up on while new things are coming out.

I guess I just need to take my time and enjoy."
26837,"Yeah take your time and figure out what you like, sometimes easy to fall into a buying frenzy when first entering the hobby."
26838,"I got overwhelmed with the sheer number of games when I first really dove into the hobby. Luckily I am now in a place where I have nearly ever single game I would ever want to own. Do I still want 3 more games? Yes. But I can now patiently wait for the reprints, because I have a completely sweet collection now. If anything, I need to thin out my collection."
26839,"I did write one a while back specifically about classics that have stayed in my collection.

https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/di9b8q/cult\_of\_the\_notsonew\_my\_favourite\_games\_that\_have/"
26840,"This is a treasure trove, thank you! Saving the post so I can properly trawl through and look things up this weekend."
26841,"There’s a great ongoing pair of Geeklists on BGG you might find helpful.   
One is “New To You” where people post mini-reviews of what they’ve played that month.   
The 2nd is “New to You A Year Ago” where the same people revisit their lists from the previous year with updated opinions. It really helps you see what games are just Cult of the New and which ones have real staying power. 

[Here’s the June “a year ago” list](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/286357/item/8325461?commentid=10347577#comment10347577)

Just wait….GenCon (in Sept this year) and Essen Spiel (in October) are usually where the biggest number of game releases happen. It’s fun, but can be overwhelming!"
26842,Thanks so much for this!
26843,"Glad to see someone else enjoying Ride the Rails, it's given me some of my favourite games of 2020. My copy of **Iberian Gauge** arrived recently and I'm very excited to play it, but unfortunately we're currently locked down here with no end in sight. Something to look forward to. 🙂"
26844,"Yeah! Light on rules overhead, players have picked it up pretty quick."
26845,"I just wanted to thank you for mentioning Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. I didn't know this was a thing. Nothing quite like having a $200 40lb board game sitting on the shelf because I don't know where to start lol, I'll have to check it out!"
26846,Really is the best tutorial for a fairly complex game that I've played! Just follow the first 5 missions and open things when it tells you. Really nice. They even have a starting hand of cards that explains the iconography and effects in more detail.
26847,GH is $100 and 20lb…. Don’t know if that was an intentional exaggeration…
26848,Yea it was lol. Seems like I spent more and it's heavier when it's just sitting in my shelf lol
26849,Think of the free workout you can get moving it every day to play!
26850,Am I a great big idiot or is there no article here anymore?
26851,The real board games of 2020 were the friends we social distanced from along the way.
26854,I don’t see it either. *scratches head*
26857,"fixed! it was stuck processing the first image, so I re-uploaded the image"
26855,"That’s weird? I still see it on mobile and web, are you using a mobile client?"
26856,Interesting - I copied the link and opened it in my browser and suddenly it’s there!
26858,I’m on the iOS app
26859,"Damn, Bonfire has me intrigued as hell. How would you say it compares to Castles of Burgundy?"
26860,"Well heavier for sure, Burgundy is towards the more tactical end of Feld’s games, while the weight/complexity for Bonfire is more strategic in terms of planning to complete the task tiles. Some of the designer DNA remains the same though, chiefly the triggering of nice combos is very satisfying."
26861,"An 18xx game in the top 3?

My bro. Chesapeake got my whole group into 18xx, and 18xx.games just fanned that flame."
26862,"Your list looks like it might not have updated properly.

Great read otherwise."
26863,"Oh odd, what appears off to you?"
26864,"I just see 1. all the way down instead of an increasing list. I'll double check that it's not just baconreader.

Edit: Shows that way on Reddit. I think it's the extra text making it think they're all separate lists rather than formatting as a single list."
26865,"Ah okay removed the period and added a dash, should fix the auto-formatting it's trying to do."
26866,Looks good.
26867,Everything is number one?
26868,edited!
26869,"We played a game of Search for Planet X and then immediately played a game of Alchemists and decided Alchemists is just a much better game! 

I'll try it with a few new gamers and see what happens"
26870,"Aww, I put in a BGG order a week ago. Faiyum and  Merchants of Dunhuang weren't on my radar then."
26871,"This is a great overview of Merchants of Dunhuang:

https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/118469/game-overview-merchants-dunhuang-or-picking-goods"
26872,I always read about how great 18Chesapeake is as an intro to 18xx but does the fact that it’s a much more forgiving game perhaps lead to an okay but not great experience. In my experience it’s the knives that make 18xx what people love about 18xx. Without then is there enough here to actually get players enthusiastic for more?
26873,"For me at least, the players I've introduced are coming from playing mostly Euro games, so I think having that softer onboarding in 18Ches and 1846/1889 really helps. And really, you can still really get yourself in trouble in all three of the aforementioned games, just not the ultra sharp knives of some other titles."
26874,"The only one of those games I've played is **New York Zoo** but my wife and I have enjoyed it a lot. I'm at least vaguely aware of everything else on the list... Whistle Mountain and Viscounts are even on my shelf, just haven't gotten to try them out yet."
26875,I really enjoyed **Whistle Mountain**. It uses that shared board element you mentioned to great effect.
26876,Great read!
26877,"I'm surprised that I haven't played more of your Top 20! It made me interested to see how many 2020 games I've played. My (rough) list so far is:

**Excellent:**

* Hallertau
* My City
* Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Baker Street Irregulars

**Great:**

* Beyond the Sun
* Bonfire
* Hansa Teutonica: Big Box
* Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 (in progress)

26879,">Fort

I would love to hear your thoughts on Fort and Stellar (and Beyond the Sun) if its ok :)  
Also why you found Oceans ""meh""  


I'm asking because they're on my wishlist!"
26880,"**Beyond the Sun** is a unique and interesting worker placement/area control game that I really like, and has an awesome resource mechanic, but I do think it is hindered by some issues. The art direction is functional, but pretty bland. The variable worker placement spots could be more interesting/game breaking and there could be more of them (there IS an expansion coming which should fix this). It's definitely overpriced. Most importantly though, I think the board is just too big. You have to read a lot of cards, and, for instance, if you're sitting on the side of the table away from the area control board you have no idea what's going on over there, which is probably going to dictate your playstyle more than anything. 

**Stellar** is just an awesome and extremely underrated 2-player game. I still play it frequently, and just picked up the multiplayer ""sequel"" **Subastral**. This game gets a huge recommend. 

**Oceans** I really wanted to like, and I played it a couple more times before selling it. The presentation is really good, but I think I just don't love games where I have to be looking at other people's tableaus all the time. I found it a little too mean for my tastes, and my friends found it a lot too mean for theirs. It is the only game that my wife has ever said she'd never play again, and we play mean games all the time. 

I only played **Fort** the once, almost a year ago now, and I don't remember much about it other than the great presentation. I only played it with 2, it might be more exciting at higher counts."
26881,Wow thanks for taking the time to write this! I appreciate :D
26882,"The designer of Santa Monica said an mini expansion is on the making and will bring events to the game and not much more stuff. Its expected to be ready by the end of this year.
Sadly its just a mini expansion that will cost 10 dollars or so, its a order from the Publisher."
26883,"Unpopular Opinion but i find Gloomhaven so overrated, to me its just a skirmish game"
26884,"That’s really the primary reason my group and I imagine many other groups play it too, for the skirmish/combat and combat system. Even the publisher website starts off with “EURO-INSPIRED TACTICAL COMBAT IN AN EVOLVING CAMPAIGN”."
26885,"waiting to see your list after Praga Caput Regni and Whistle Mountain :) (i loved whistle mountain)  


what about dwellings of eldervale? no interest on the game?"
26887,"Honestly this is not far from BGG top100, which unfortunately makes it pretty boring. A lot of very heavy games on the top and generally a lot of games that scream ""i'm not playing this enough so I'm rating it very high""."
26888,"I've played  **Brass**, **Food Chain Magnate**, **A Feast for Odin**, and  **Twiliight Struggle**  10 to 50 times  and they're seriously good games.  Biggest ping against most of them is the opening becomes a bit samey and you can tell the creator meant for some things to be viable that just aren't, but if you get over it they offer a great experience at least through the number of plays I've done."
26889,I'll add War of the Ring to this list. I played it probably 30 times and it was just getting a bit samey when I added Lords of Middle Earth and it's still great. (Warriors I liked less - very excited for the 3rd expansion).
26890,How Euro-y does Brass feel to play? I'm crazy interested in this game but my group tends to get bored with games if there's not enough excitement going on.
26891,"I don't know what your group finds exciting but I'm guessing they want player interaction?

Brass has tons of player interaction in that what you do on the board really affects other players.  The spaces are very limited and the rail/canal links and coal/iron/ports built by one player can be used by all, as well as all players affecting the demand tracks/distant market.  This is basically what makes the game so heavy and long since any action you take could easily be a better move for your opponent and the strategic landscape is likely to have changed by the time the turns get back to you.

There's no pew-pew take that, and the game itself moves slowly with all players likely lost in thought (we adopted a rule that you have to tap on the next player's shoulder when done since we were spending too much time with someone not knowing it's their turn lol).  If that sounds exciting to your group then you'll love it, if not then I can definitely understand because it's not for everyone."
26892,That's a great point. A heavy game is still going to feel 'fresh' after a few months if you only get to play it a couple of times
26893,"Thanks, I think that's the main reason bgg top looks like it does. People are excited about games and they don't play them enough to see throught their ""cracks"". I think a lot of us has been excited about first games of Catan, Carcassone, TtR etc. But we've played it so much that the ratings dropped. This is not the case with games like Twillight Imperium or Legacy games (because they are designed to be played once throught campaign)."
26894,For this reason I like to check out categories like “Family” or “Strategy” - usually brings a few more fun playable ones into the mix. :)
26895,"I think there's the opposite effect too.  First you see only the upside, then only the flaws, then you see both together for how it really is (sometimes happens in the other order too)."
26896,"Just as one counterpoint:

[Gloomhaven plays this month](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven/stats): 2,224 (yes, that many plays in just the first 1/3rd of the month)

And it continues to be in the top 10 most played games on BGG even 3 years after its release.

Of course there's a lot of quibbling to be had over BGG plays data but.. at least its data. And not all the games in the top 10 make it to the table that much, but they're all still making it to the table regularly. So you can make whatever sweeping determinations about the reasons for people's rankings you like, but uh, I'd say that the reason these games are still rated so highly is because people are still playing them."
26897,This is good feedback. If this list isn't providing value I'm more than ok with not having to put in the work to make it.
26898,"I'm late with my reply, but I highly appreciate your effort. 

I noticed Everdell isn't on the Reddit Top 100. It's #37 on BGG. I didn't see it mentioned in the monthly threads I think. Are there any similar noticeable differences like that?

Additionally would you know how to perform a custom BGG Ranking based on Weight less than 2.5?"
26899,"For me there is a value, seeing that active redditors align with taste with active BGG users and I try to always check these lists. It's more of a dissapointment with a result?  


Thanks for all your hard work."
26900,Counterpoint: But some of us out there do play the heck out of some of these giants. Myself I am trying to schedule my 30th play of TI4 hopefully before PoK is released. I would hazard to guess a lot of these are rated highly because for many folks they are the grail game(s) in their collection. God knows TI4 does it for me in a way no other can.
26901,"I play \*a lot\* of board games. And I've been through the top 10 multiple times, minus Twilight Struggle.   


I don't think they're biased for the most part. I'll argue Gloomhaven is. But the rest is fairly regularly playable, Twilight Imperium set aside. And still, Twilight Imperium is such an experience that it definitely deserve a spot around.

I think I can show these top games to any boardgamer and he's probably going to love them. Which makes them deserving of those spots.

Obviously everyone will have their opinion (like mine on Gloomhaven, and where I definitely think Rebellion is far superior to War of the Ring), but the general consensus makes a lot of sense.  


I do think however, that these lists are less and less relevant. There is a massive trend, especially with kickstarters, of straight 10 and 0 often before the game is even played. You can even see comments that are written as ""balancing out""..."
26902,"I had a time in my life where I played hundred games per week.  
There is only a single game in top10 that I rate 6/10. Others are lower.  
And I don't think new people coming into the hobby should try any of them. Maybe Terraforming is easy enough to try, but still think there are better alternatives.  
And again I think that very few people can enjoy repeat plays of Pandemic Legacy (multiple campaigns). We have far better computer games that do the same thing as gloomhaven does and so on and so on. Of course the top10 are good games, but they are not THAT good.

Long playtime is a huge advantage in climbing BGG ratings. I've seen a correlation when I was doing my master thesis on boardgame recommender engine."
26903,"So essentially, because you don't like the games in the top 10, there has to be some conspiracy as to why they are there.

Even though the number 1 and 2 game, completely shatter your entire theory.

Ok."
26904,Yeah that is what I wrote. Oh wait it is not.
26905,"A person who owns Settlers will play it a dozen times or more.  A person who owns the top 10 games here might only play each once, if they even open the plastic wrap.

It's like the difference between the box office and the Oscars - chances are most people would prefer the box office hit even if it's ""less good"" by Academy standards."
26906,"I think there's quite a bit of speculation in that statement. This is an enthusiast's list for other enthusiasts. It really isn't too far of a stretch to imagine that a group who bought into Gloomhaven is actually playing it thoroughly.
Pandemic Legacy probably doesn't have a lot of people rating it who played one or two months and said ""Close enough, I'll give it a ten"".

Though I don't have most of the games in the top ten, I have 5 or 6 in the top twenty five, and three of those are my most played games with well over 100 plays of each."
26907,">A person who owns Settlers will play it a dozen times or more.  A person who owns the top 10 games here might only play each once, if they even open the plastic wrap.

Idk, I have over 20 recorded plays of **A Feast for Odin**, **Scythe**, and **Pax Pamir 2e**, and 15+ recorded plays of **Agricola**, **FCM**, and **GWT** among others. And that's just my recorded plays glancing through BGStats.

Just because a game is heavier doesn't always mean people will play it less."
26908,Are you a typical owner?  No.
26909,"Maybe slightly atypical, but lots of people play their games more than once. Especially those that are in the reddit guild and contribute their rankings to this list."
26910,"Redditors by definition are atypical in their amount of play - most people buy board games as an aspiration rather than with a specific plan to play.

It’s just like how on average, most people who buy a video game don’t actually reach the end (and iirc up to 25% play one time or less)."
26911,[Last month's Top 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/in8tdh/the_subs_top_100_as_of_the_end_of_aug_2020/)
26912,"Sorry if this has been brought up before, but I think expandalones/ game families should be grouped together. In a year or two three of the top ten games will probably be Gloomhaven, Jaws of the Lion (also Gloomhaven), and Frosthaven (another Gloomhaven)."
26913,"If they're separate on BGG, they're separate here. One bad game in a family that no one plays would unfairly tank the whole thing. (Plus that'd be a whole lot of manual labor, so, no thanks.) 

A separate top list of the game families (or other groupings) would be interested, though."
26914,Just wishful thinking. But I didn't consider how the group's average could be dragged down.
