The most common criticism of Ranger it's the speed since it's written in Python, but it really doesn't bother me, i guess it can become annoying if you are using it on folders with thousands of files on a hard drive or something.

It's similar to Ranger and other terminal-based, miller column, vim-like, file managers, but it's more minimalist by default and was much faster than Ranger in my experience. It's deliberately lacking some features (like tabs) that can be handled better in other ways (I personally use i3 tabbed windows.) It's very customisable but the project wiki has lots of good documentation and easy tips to expand functionality, so I think it's good even for a beginner.

`nnn` works great on any DE. That's the goal - not to sacrifice the comfort of the DE and having the convenience of the terminal.

I don't know about that but seeing your consistently negative/outright irrelevant replies on almost every thread in this post one would mistake your level of loudness as _trolling_.

For everybody pushing `ranger`: I use `mc` and `nnn`, each for different purposes. A test of `ranger` didn't give a good impression for me - too confusing, kind of in between `mc` and `nnn`, but not as good as either.

You should try `nnn`, and also the other utilities /u/sablal wrote. He has a knack for writing useful and lean apps. `nnn` is less than 30kB for the binary, with a ton of features. In contrast, look at `Etcher`, which clocks in at 100MB as an AppImage (only available Linux option) and doesn't anything else besides writing an image to disk and verifying it.

I am disgusted by this trend and wish there would be more like `nnn`, not like `Etcher`."

Or my workflow is not sufficient? 

copy, move, delete files is took much time compare to finder, but why would we have to do that instead just have a binding to remove the files, like cd xx && rm file?

Update: `nnn` has keys to copy, paste and move now.

I don't think so. The `nnn` way is to copy the file paths, press `!` and run `rm (ncp) -rvf` (refer to the readme for _ncp_). So you are pressing an extra `!`. The reasons why we prefer this is in the link above.

> but why would we have to do that instead just have a binding to remove the files, like cd xx && rm file?

Exactly! You can do it of your own volition. `nnn` supports as many scripts as you need.

> I want config NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER for Osx, what should I fill in

Set it to whatever is your default file manager in OS X. But if you _really_ want to go with it, just try `nnn` solo for a day or two."

499,"You can do that -- that is my default setup for giving lectures. But I would slightly prefer, if possible, a solution that doesn't require me to log in to multiple zoom accounts and remember which hosting, make sure audio/video is on/off on the right one, etc. The whole thing seems kind of stupid and clunky. It would be nice to just have a stylus be able to mark up PDFs on my single screen share."
500,Interesting 🤔 I've never had to log into multiple zoom accounts to get this done. Have you encountered problems before?
501,"Sorry for maybe not being clear. I *could* just use my iPad alone logged into zoom, but then I don't have easy access to the zoom controls and students, chat window, email, etc, that I have on my Desktop and can easily monitor while lecturing, and where I can fast switch between applications. My paradigm is even more clunky if I try to just use the iPad alone, than logging both into my desktop and iPad."
502,"I know you said you don't like there multiple screens but honestly it's so worth it.

I lecture from my iPad and keep track of everything from my desktop.

And Zoom let's one computer and one tablet log in with the same account. I usually start the meeting on my desktop then join with my iPad. Since I'm using the same Zoom account on both it automatically makes me a co-host when the iPad joins."
503,"Oh no way, using a tablet alone, no way. My setup is to log into zoom on laptop first, then tablet-> screenshare. Haven't had any issues since March personally.. (Not with zoom... But dear God. My wifi, I taught at 08:00 and nearly every morning at ~07:45 the internet would die. (As well as other points in the day.) It was almost comedic after a while.)"
504,Do you use an iPad? My searching has only yielded screensharing in the other direction (from desktop to iPad). How do you share your iPad screen to your desktop mac?
505,"Can you export the PDF to OneNote? 
One note is designed for pen functionality. It would be easier to use.

Edit:
That's what I do with my lecture.
(The PDF contains 110 pages in total)"
506,"Thanks for the advice! So far it works better than the other solutions I've tried -- for example the eraser works! (I'm not sure yet how well the import PDF works, I had to ""insert printout"", but it seemed to get the job done)"
507,"There is full screen, but I can't find a presentation mode for OneNote. For your lectures does it still show the editing ribbon, etc, to your students?"
508,"I typically do my lecture asynchronously.

It looks like this view (OneNote screenshot)

https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTUgm9G2nZkgBfCzFucT32sL58JviP7Tpwxnw&usqp=CAU


I typically minimize the tabs.

If I have the time, on occasion, I crop the video with an editing software."
509,"OK. Some software has a presentation mode (Powerpoint, Acrobat), that only shows the slides. I don't know if those modes ever work for asynchronous video production."
510,I'll message you with some videos I made for asynchronous lecture
511,I used Wacom and preview in Mac. If you open your pdf in preview your Wacom should be supported for markup.
512,"It supports the minimum of using the pen as a mouse, which all applications support. But, for example, I can't use the buttons on the pen to erase or change color etc."
513,"If you want full support, there’s the adobe suite, but nothing free comes to mind unfortunately. If you install the Wacom driver you should be able to set the hot buttons on the tablet to your preference though (such as color or stroke width) and that should work for most applications."
514,"I have the driver, but all it does as far as I can tell is set the buttons to various possible keyboard or mouse inputs, so if the application requires a certain button to be pressed (in order to, for example, erase), then there is no way to set the hot buttons to get the pen to erase, for example."
515,"I use a Wacom Intuos with Ubuntu\* to correct/grade student homework which is submitted as a pdf.

&#x200B;

I use xournal ([http://xournal.sourceforge.net/](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/)).  You can set one of the pen buttons to activate the eraser while your holding it.  

There is xournal++ ([https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)) which might have the same features.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*i originally had a problem with the intuos where half the tablet would be used and just weird screen behavior.  it took a long time to troubleshoot so i want to mention here in case anyone had the same problem and found their way here: the intuos can work with android phones and when plugged into a phone goes into 'android mode'.  when you plug an intuos into a computer using ubuntu, it might think it's a phone and go into android mode.  to switch out of android mode, hold the two outer buttons on the tablet until the indicator light on the tablet gets brighter (like 2 or 3 seconds)."
516,"This is more for windows machines, but I've found that Microsoft applications do a good job with pen/annotation.

Powerpoint is one example, but like you said it doesn't work for pdfs.

For PDFs, I use the microsoft edge browser.  You open the pdf inside edge, you'll get a menu across the top that allows you to choose color and thickness of lines."
517,"I'm having the same issue. The stylus works really well with the art software included, but it's not possible to open or import .pdf files in this software. Using the stylus with Mac preview seems laggy. I have an old version of Adobe Acrobat Professional, but it crashes whenever I try to change the pencil colour from red. The free Adobe program seems to just do signatures, not general markup. I just downloaded a trial of PDF Expert and it seems to work well."
518,Someone in this thread suggested importing the PDF into OneNote. So far it is working better than the other solutions I've tried. I haven't tried PDF Expert.
519,"We are using an OWL 360-view camera set up with Canvas conferences.  There are Wacom boards placed in some of the classrooms and I've tried using Microsoft Whiteboard with it and it's been the best option in my opinion; I have similar opinions as to what you've mentioned.  You can upload PDF's of slides, but it arranges them all on a grid so you have to zoom in to access any one slide that you want to annotate.  That's the frustrating part of MS Whiteboard."
520,OneNote. And just use microsoft class notebook. You are welcome.
521,Have you tried GoodNotes?
522,I have the same question.
523,"Be aware of my other reply to the post where i write about xournal++.

New website of them
https://xournalpp.github.io/"
524,"It's built into Preview, it's just called 'Manage Signature' - in signature mode, you can write freehand on the trackpad."
525,"That may work well for, well, signing things, but not for marking up an entire PDF. Especially since it requires I use the trackpad, as apposed to my drawing tablet. Doing things maths with that wouldn’t be feasible."
526,Have you tried Kami? My kid’s math teacher is using it for virtual learning. She posts pdf worksheets that the kids can modify and submit back to her. The interface looks like it has the typical annotation tools. Maybe it would work for you?
527,GoodNotes.
528,"Did you hear of xournal++ ?
Its free software and avaiable also for MacOS

https://xournalpp.github.io/

Thats the new site, so for more information you could use their github page as described in the link:)

I want to mention, that i use xournal++ with two graphic tables (one from XP Pen and one Wacom) with Windows and with GNU/Linux it works just great. But i never tried xournal++ with MacOS. Simply because i dont have a Mac yet :)"
529,"I just took a look at it (I wanna try *everything free* before shelling out cash just for school).

It looks promising, but there are some obvious issues. I *have* to run it via terminal, because MacOS requires apps request permissions to access things like the desktop, and even after granting full disk access, it doesn't know what to do with itself.

It *can* markup PDFs, and can also export (yes!). It is a decent bit laggy when using my drawing tablet, which is annoying, but I think I can manage.

Thank you for the suggestion!

\[Edit\]

If I move the file to my `~/Public` folder, and don't run it as root, drawing is *much* better. I'll just have to see if I can fix the folder access issue, haha."
530,"Thanks for the information:)
As i mentioned, unfortunately i can not test xournal++ with MacOS.

Your idea with running it without root looks promising. Did you think to give feedback on their github page (issues)? Maybe they can make the app better with your input:)

Thanks again and have fun working with this app!"
531,"Notability.. one time purchase unlike good notes. With good notes, you have to pay when their next version comes out"
532,"After trying a free options, I decided to try this one since it was cheap. It works wonderfully! Thanks for the suggestion."
533,Glad I could help!
534,Drawboard PDF
535,"I use the app Microsoft Office Lens to scan paper notes my professor gives me and convert the PDF into a word doc. I then type up additional notes digitally. I know this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, but They have a bunch of options so you might want to take a look to see if something will work for you."
536,"If it's a Mac, PDF Expert"
537,"If you are on Windows, try PDF XChange Editor. Free version has quite a lot of editing features. I absolutely love it!
For android - xodo pdf"
538,"Only on Reddit one stumbles upon gems like this (at least it seems like it, I'm installing it now)"
539,"First of all: Yes. The Adobe Reader is terrible for your use-case. The software itself is so bloated and unresponsive that I don't even install it on my systems anymore after a fresh install.

The good news is, though:
You have several choices, depending on your budget and the amount of features you want to use.

---
My personal preference:
[PDF Annotator](https://www.pdfannotator.com/en/) is the ""swiss army knife"": many features, highly customizable, but the license is quite expensive for normal end-users: 70€ (normal price) or 40€ for student (discount) licenses. Back when I went to university, I bought that software with the student discount and not once regretted it. It truly is some great piece of software, if you want or need a lot of features. Besides the pen-input itself (for highlighting/annotations), it has some nifty features like adding blank pages as a work-sheet for you to draw on, rotating single pages or merging/adding/removing single pages or whole documents. I've been regularly using PDF annotator to just merge several PDF documents into one file because it's so handy in that regard.

BUT - there's two potential downsides to that software:

1) With a heavy amount of features also comes some ""bloat"": Compared to other light-weight applications (like Sumatra or Foxit Reader), PDF Annotator feels quite ""slow"". Due to this I'm only using it when I know that I'll need to annotate (or otherwise edit) something in a PDF. If I only want to read stuff, the ""faster"" PDF apps are my go-to.

2) You need to be aware about their pricing model before you buy. I was quite upset when I was faced with their price-model for major upgrades (e.g. when there's big version changes, jumping from v5 to v6). 
I bought PDF Annotator Version 4 back in 2013, upgraded it once to version 5 (for free during the first 2 years if you have the ""upgrade assurance"") and have been using it since. 
BUT: If I wanted to upgrade to the newest Version now (v7), I'd have to shell out another 50€, which honestly sucks. The ""Upgrade Assurance"" for 'free' upgrades makes it a bit cheaper (17,50€ per year), but it's still... not ideal.

I totally get that developing niche-software is expensive, but that's a lot of money for a software upgrade and in some cases almost prohibitively expensive for some students.

---
[Xodo](https://www.xodo.com/) PDF is more light-weight and also free for personal use. If you don't need a lot of features, Xodo should be alright for working with a stylus.

[Drawboard PDF](https://www.drawboard.com/) emphasizes the workflow with a pen/stylus within PDF files. It was a one-time purchase once, but recently they went with a ""PRO"" subscription model (24,99€/year) on top of that. Haven't used the pro features before, so I can't really give a recommendation for those, but it's definitely on the cheaper end of ""feature rich"" PDF-annotation-software.

---

If you need more than a simple PDF editor, you might want to take a look at the feature-set of [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/About/Features) (open source). It's a research/reference manager similar to Mendeley/Zotero, but has an inbuilt pdf viewer with editing/annotation capabilities. 

I don't know how solid the pen-support in that software is (especially compared to Drawboard/PDF Annotator) but you might want to give it a try if you can use the additional features of that software. There's some [additional user-reviews for it on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/qiqqa/).

---

So yeah, that's my list. I've been trying to stay as ""paperless"" as possible for 10 years now and those are the PDF applications that I'd take a closer look at now. Sadly, most of the other PDF applications are geared towards businesses (and they show in their pricing that they really don't care or bother with ""normal"" end-users)."
540,"That's pretty in-depth 

Going to try the free one first and see if it is good enough"
541,"Update

Xodo doesn't work

It just locks when pressing the pen and when lifting the pen it keep drawing"
542,"What system/device are you using? That sounds like the screen doesn't detect your pen lift-off in time (which sometimes happened to me when palm rejection wasn't working properly on my windows tablet, basically forcing me to do a restart).

Since you wrote, I got curious and also gave Xodo another go using a Wacom One with Windows 10: Both the highlight-marker and the colored pens worked flawless for me.

After that I also tried out the pencil annotation function with [Foxit Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxit_Software#Foxit_Reader) (the free version), which worked fine, but I don't really dig their pen-implementation. Seems a tad too basic and clunky for my taste. (It basically shows you the line with a slight delay while you're drawing, then re-draws it completely when you lift off the pen. It works, but feels ""off"".)"
543,"Have you tried using Microsoft Edge? I know it sounds nuts, but their PDF reader is solid."
544,You mean the internet browser?
545,"Yeah, they have a bunch of annotation tools. I work in the PDF industry, I find it pretty impressive what they give for free."
546,"Have you taken a look at One Note from Microsoft? You can give your students the unfilled pdf and then use One Note to write on it, streaming or recording your session."
547,"Any good pdf reader will have annotation tools. I use PDF X-Change, it works for me. You can probably find a good pdf reader app that allows annotations, for free"
548,"It depenc a bit on what you are looking for if you just want to annotate PDF's you want something different then when you want to take meeting notes or lecture notes. (IMHO)

[OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhvjl) (Free)

A full on notebook replacement:

+ + Cross device/ Platform sync
+ + Optimized for the New Surface Pen
+ + Endless page good when the Notes get longer and not just fill in on the PDF
-  - Highlighting dose not stay on text
- - Exporting is more difficult since the page dose not stay with standard sizes

[Drawboard PDF](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhwqt) ($9.99 right now on sell for $6.99)

A perfect PDF annotation App.


+ + Highlighting stays on the text
+ + Pages stay in the size of the original document
+ - Not very many non PDF features
+ - Not very good for organizing documents and keeping them in one place

[Xodo PDF Reader & Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdjxp4) (Free)

I can not say much about this one since I have not used it yet.


I personally use OneNote to keep my Notes organized, school, work, life. I have Notebooks for everything. Each Semester I make a new notebook for school, each Client has their own notebook, and big projects in life have their own notebook too. (Yes I have a Notebook dedicated to my 2 year old)

I use Drawboard for reading long PDF's and highlighting. I tried using it for note taking in class but I always run out of space. I don't use it for meeting notes either since I sometimes have pictures or web links in them and I find OneNote more useful for that."
549,Xodo is awesome. I use it at work. It's really powerful for a free app.
550,I just got my new Pen and will test it now.
551,"Drawboard PDF is still the best. OneNote is nice for note-taking and it's free, but it gets messy when you try to save the pdf again. Of course, you can always use Fill & Sign on Adobe Acrobat to annotate PDFs for free."
552,"Xodo is fine but quirky and good for simple stuff, I use it 95% of the time and it's free, so no reason not to try. Drawboard offers more features but is a little more complicated.  Fuck using Onenote for PDFs unless you're particularly masochistic. 

They all have different UI's and they are all a pain in the ass for casual use.  The disparate UI issue is an MS problem from 3.1 so no change their."
553,"While I have heard others also speak highly of importing and working on PDFs within OneNote, I completely am in agreement with your sentiment on this point!"
554,"You can use OneNote for PDFs, the key is keeping the sections short. If it's under 20-30 pages it'll work great. I usually break textbooks or handouts into chunks."
555,I use Drawboard PDF
556,Still can't open two PDFs side by side
557,"I don't use wacom for taking notes.

This is just a idea. How about getting those virtual keyboard with handwriting input. And using your wacom to write on that."
558,"I do use my Wacom One for taking notes.

I was too lazy to investigate apps, so I use rather Illustrator CS6 (good for pasting photos and instant tracing too) or our best and worst enemy, Paint. It fits me

Wacom One is intended on everything you can do with a pen and more. It's all about the software you are comfortable with using & tweaked settings. You do you"
559,"Thanks. I went with evernote, there is a small learning curve but i'm overall very satisfied with the quality of my notes :). Way better than my paper notes."
560,"> Any tips guys? Maybe a better software than evernote? Or maybe Wacom one is not intended for what i'm using it for?

Just to make sure, we're talking about this [Wacom One](https://www.wacom.com/en-de/products/pen-displays/wacom-one) with a screen, right? Even if you had the ""One by Wacom"", the previous device that was only a graphic tablet, you'd be perfectly fine - it would just take a bit longer to get a good handwriting down without a screen.

First of all: Your writing will get better the more you're accustomed to writing on a ""slippery"" screen. The beginning looks always messy, but once you've got your hand/eyes-coordination down, it'll work just as fine (or even better) than on dead trees.

Regarding your software choice:

- I gave Evernote a try years ago (I've been using digital handwriting programs since 2010) and was underwhelmed by the amount of features that Evernote had back then. The price they were asking for was too high for the little convenience that Evernote offered
- If you're using Windows 10, you might have [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) already installed. Currently the different versions of OneNote are [kinda messy in terms of feature-parity](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-the-difference-between-the-onenote-versions-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US), but if you're on Windows, just make sure to download the [OneNote 2016 Desktop Installer](https://www.onenote.com/download). There's also a OneNote app that you can get from the Microsoft store, but that one doesn't have the same back-up features that the ""desktop""-version offers. You can use both in conjunction, but I heavily recommend setting up the ""desktop""-version first, just to make sure that you have local backups of your notes in case the ""sync""-feature shits the bed.
- There's also a Microsoft ""garage""-project in development that's called [Journal](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/journal-a-microsoft-garage-project/9n318r854rhh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). It focuses on digital pen input and has some neat additional ""ink-first"" features like pen gestures.

If you need to write on PDFs and make annotations, I've written down [some recommendations in a previous comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/fiinft/looking_for_a_pdf_reader_that_allows_you_to_write/fkjaznc/). Don't even try to print PDFs into OneNote and write on top of them. It's a recipe for disaster and messed up notes. If you need to write on PDFs, think about a good folder structure, throw your folder-layout into the cloud and use whatever PDF-editing program suits your needs best."
561,"[Okular](https://okular.kde.org/download/) and [Sumatra](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader) have pretty good Annotations for Documents.

For a complete hand-drawing software (which also supports PDFs) I recommend [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)

Then again, there is [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It is specialized for electronic documents. You might find an annotation plugin for it. It is worth to check out that one, too."
562,why not adobe ?
563,Can adobe do epub as well?
564,this one does [Adobe Digital Edition](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html)
565,"Off the top of my head - Adobe Digital Editions, OneNote and Evernote can do this.  
  
All three open PDF & ePub, have syncing and support annotations."
566,"I just tried OneNote. It didn't want to open my ePub file, and the PDF file had to be printed to it and turned into a glorified screenshot. So I could draw on it but couldn't select or search text.

Evernote can embed the PDFs, but I can't seem to use the drawing tool directly on the pdf. All of my drawings end up outside of it.

Haven't tried Digital Editions with the drawing tablet yet."
567,"Need an addon to import epubs. Sorry.  
   http://www.onenotegem.com/a/documents/onenote-batch//2019/1122/872.html"
568,You can use the app named xodo pdf editor it’s quite good and has a ton of features also free
569,"I use the medium size for annotation and mark-up of pdfs. I also write notes with it. I tried the small at first and it is definitely not suitable for handwriting on such a large screen: you have to form tiny letters on the tablet that will be magnified hugely on the screen. Medium is the best bet but keep in mind that depending on your normal writing size, the medium may be too small for your screen. Make sure you can return the tablet for the large version if that is the case."
570,"if just writing, most tablets will do fine. An Intuos Pro might be overkill but are a very comfy size.

Whats your budget, the smaller intuos bt tablets are cheap and good for non pro art."
571,"Hmm. Budget is around $150 to $200.
What size do you suggest for 27"" iMac? I think I'll neee a medium to large tablet."
572,"its not really necessary to have a tablet close to the size of your screen. The [Intuos M](https://us-store.wacom.com/Catalog/Pen-Tablets/wacom-intuos/wacom-intuos-m-bt#/undefined1) sounds like in your range.

The intuos Pros start at $380, so youd have to find a used one if you want one of those for under $200."
573,"I would suggest a Medium. I use a Small, but I'm not using it for annotation, just for running the UI and some photo editing. For annotations and notes, a Small might not be big enough to provide room for handwriting.

Don't worry about resolution because the Wacom tablet resolution exceeds the resolution of the display.

Measure your desk to make sure you have room for it in a convenient place. The Large size is truly large...I have no room for it."
574,Use [cyberghost](https://7proxiesdeep.com/more-information/cyberghost-vpn-trial/) since it has no logs and they don't keep any of your data.  It's also pretty fast so your downloads go quick.  Another good one with no logs is [ExpressVPN](https://7proxiesdeep.com/more-information/express/) but it's more expensive
575,"Anything without logging: cyberghost, zenmate, expressvpn, mullvad, windscribe.  Cyberghost is also pretty fast so it's what I use, but haven't tested them all"
576,I use Nord and honestly I love it. It’s been almost a year now and I haven’t received any more pesky emails from my internet provider about torrenting. And the speed is great. It also has a killswitch feature like most vpn. I recommend it.
577,What anti virus do you use? If you have a vpn does that stop intruders or make you more susceptible?
578,"To be honest I just run a simple anti virus that came with my laptop. As for does it make me more susceptible or not? I’m not sure. I’m sure if you googled it some more you’d find out. I’d like to think the worse thing that could happen is possibly downloading a virus via torrents. But I’ve been doing this a while and have yet to encounter anything on my end. Maybe it’s just luck, or maybe I’m using the right tactics. Either way, Nord is a good vpn that gets too much hate."
579,"Bullet proof leak protection is a feature of air vpn.

It's 100% safe and no way it will leak because it utilizes automatic firewall rules of windows firewall but don't use a third party firewall with it it needs the windows firewall.

Cyberghost got a great combo of network lock + app Guardian"
580,"Yes, the leak protection of AirVPN's client (""Eddie"") is pretty sophisticated and no provider can touch Air in this matter. Air is ideal for torrenting IMO.

On a bad day i can barely squeeze 30 - 40 MBit out of them. It's a bit weird, i know, and i am certainly complaining on a very high level. Maybe there is a bad routing from Uppsala / Sweden to my place, who knows..."
583,"Try their Norway or Netherland servers, might be better routing from there."
584,They guarantee 4mbps last time I checked.
585,Yes your right but to be honest I was never limited by that I exceeded it allways and was limited by my connection / hardware
586,"Yep, AirVPN is pretty good."
587,Nord and express I have good experience with them .
588,You need to bind your torrent client to your VPN server to eliminate chance of exposure using any VPN provider.
589,How do you do this?
590,It is a little different for each Torrent client.  Just google your client name along with IP bind.  You should get lots of links to choose from.
591,"Got Nord a few months back, was recommended to me as a good app for Android but I mostly use it on my desktop. I got my CC details leaked and now am extremely paranoid so I'm using an Internet kill switch, which means you can only access the Internet when using the VPN.

601,You need a VPN app with a Kill Switch feature. It basically prevents your PC from connecting to the Internet when VPN connection drops and automatically enables the connection again when VPN connection is established. There are several VPN providers with this feature that you can choose from. They are all listed in [this article](https://cryptmode.com/stop-torrenting-protect-data-leaks-when-vpn-disconnects-best-vpn-with-kill-switch-to-auto-shutdown-internet/).
602,"I decided to go with ExpressVPN, Thanks everyone!"
603,"Many of the suggested vpn's on here are pretty good, but I still used this [nord deal](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/) for torrenting and have found it to be flawless for the past few months."
604,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is the best VPN now, really. It has the best speeds and most stable connections. Torguard isn't my favourite, it disconnected me from the server quite a lot"
605,"Honestly NordVPN is still king for me, great discounts pretty much all year and very fast."
606,"Agrh Nord are terrible shill much?

Very basic interface, and terrible p2p speeds.

when you click click to the ""fastest server"" they connect you to a 1mbs a sec server, i have a 330 mbs line!

Cost cutting low quality service"
607,"don't know what this other dude is talking about, i've been using nord for a year now and never had an issue"

610,[Fastest VPN](https://go.fastestvpn.com/affiliate/pap?a_aid=611b8885dae14) is the best VPN in 2021. I used it for ageeeees now to hide my ip and fpr tprrenting. It never let me or my friends down
611,Affiliate link -_-
612,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is your best bet right now. Torguard used to be ok, but it's just going down with the years, really. With Nord I have wayyy higher speeds and better connections. 

I mainly use it for Netflix, movies, torrenting, gaming and basically for everything and everywhere. They have [an offer going right now](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902), too."
615,"How much do you get paid to do this shit, man? Perfectly normal account up until a few months ago. Then suddenly your whole account does *nothing* but recommend that shitty VPN and link to shady promo websites. You comment on a month old thread (the thread itself has 9 upvotes) and yet within 3 days your astroturf bullshit has double that many. And that's always the story. Someone asks for a VPN rec, and every stupid comment linking to some borderline malware site recommending Nord is always highly upvoted, and their whole recent account history is just doing that same thing over and over and over. Are these just stupid bots on stolen accounts? It's so god damn annoying."
