69608,"My mom stresses crazy easy as well, she doesn't handle trauma well, but discovered she could handle elderly care and peaceful death, so she's actually ended up a nursing home RN for about 10 years then a hospice RN the past 15. Although in my mind, it'd be a lot easier to deal with trauma than to literally dedicate your career to taking care of people who are actively dying, but she claims it's easier"
69609,"General Studies.


Just pick a major. Being undecided all 4 years won't look great on your first resume unless you leave undergrad with some amazing experience that translates into an immediate position."
69610,My associates is in general studies. I changed my major so many times that my advisor just pooled my credits together and told me to show up in may for graduation.
69611,"An associate's degree in general studies from a community college before transferring to a university is not a bad way to go, especially if you use a lot of AP and early enrollment credits from high school. It can save one a lot of money. They transfer really well to the state universities, actually having the associates degree (as opposed to just a bunch of credits) helps with making sure that all the credits are accepted as transfer. But doing it because of indecisiveness or to anything beyond an associate's degree is never a good move."
69612,In Oregon you can major in transferring at a community college.  It's basically a general studies degree but every public Oregon university has agreed that you don't need any 100 or 200 level classes if transfer with it.

I double majored and so far it has worked out for me, but not so much for the people who planned to move abroad with no other degree or plan."
69619,"I’m always amazed at students who are “In going to learn X language to go to Y country and work!” Cool man, how are you going to be competitive to native bilingual speakers with a degree in something else besides the native language?"

69626,"If you don't plan on getting at least a masters degree, avoid psychology. I've known several servers, bartenders, and receptionists that have their degree in psychology. Even a few that have ended up in retail. Not that I look down on those jobs, just that they clearly don't require a psychology degree. To get a job in the field you pretty much need to have a masters at least."
69627,Wish I could have figured this out when I was 18.
69631,"My degree was a Bachelor's in Psychology.  I started out in a financial aid position at a for-profit college, but I didn't know that much about for-profit schools at the time.  Did not like it at all.  There was high turnover and they advertised the position with little detail to begin with - so I sort of got into financial aid by accident, but I learned the system, which is fairly complex.  Now I work for a community college system, but it helped me to build the experience with FAFSA at the for-profit school first.  I really don't mind the job now. I am working in a situation where I am separated from the customer service aspect - there was a lot of conflict resolution when I worked directly in the school.    

What was your degree?"
69632,"Shit, I wish I could have figured out even more things at 32.  Am 45."
69633,"Agreed. Source: am bartender with psych degree, now looking at law school or grad school."
69634,"I went back for computer science for my master's. Highly recommend going back, also Protip: get a graduate assistantship. Most schools practically give them out to grad students and you either teach a 100 level course or do some menial labor for the school and get your tuition paid for AND a moderate stipend. You end up paying fees each semester which for me was about 2 grand a semester out of pocket but it's only 2-2.5 years vs 4 and if you work a second part time job and really cut expenses you can usually pay off everything without taking on more debt!"
69635,"Just piggy-backing off this. B.S. in Psych, worked retail for 3 years, then went back for my masters in Fall 2015. I got an assistantship which paid for 75% of my tuition and gave me a $200 a week stipend. I worked in the disability services office 20 hours a week and taught a section of the ""Welcome to College"" class to freshmen. Now I work full time in a disability services office at a different school and I adjunct teach for fun. Literally my assistantship is why I'm employable and I'm not even in that much debt from a 2 year grad program!"
69636,"Master's in psych here, this is a truth.  We hire a lot of psych BA-level people as care coordinators, but honestly, it's a crap job.  They get the hardest clients, the worst pay, and the least attractive tasks."
69637,"I think its one of those degrees you need to have a plan for. My bachelor's degree was in Behavioral Science (basically psychology). I joined the military (something I planned on when I started college) as a....behavioral scientist. Making officer pay. YMMV, I guess."
69638,Eh people just need to reframe their psych degree. I focused on consumer psych in school and now I have a really neat job in brand consulting.
69639,"Ditto.  I had in interest in I/O psych, now work in Corporate Learning & Development.

Can't just expect a B.s./B.a. to land you a job.  You have to focus it on some specific function."
69640,"It really depends on your school and how much work you're willing to put it. If you get research positions, that can easily translate into research jobs after graduation, without a master's degree. That's what my friend did. I also have my psych degree, and I work for a non-profit in my area of interest while preparing to go back for my masters. Many of my classmates went into marketing and consulting (we went to a very business-minded school). So it really depends. I'm honestly so sick of this stereotype. My psych classmates have all been very successful so far, some advancing their degrees, some not.

Edit: Psych is also a huge field. Figuring out what area you want to work/specialize in will help you be successful."
69641,Art History.  My current roommate (out of college now) was an art history major.  She doesn't do any art herself.  Just really likes art.  Spends a lot of her weekends going to museums and galleries.  Can't find a job in what she wants to do.  Has an entry level position as an office administrator and she hates it.  Can't really move up much in her company because she doesn't have the knowledge of the industry shes in.  She went to a private university for it and will be paying off loans for a longgg time.
69642,"It's such a shame that this is the reality, because if I could have majored in anything without worrying about money it would have definitely been Art History. I managed to get a few classes in while I was in college and they were definitely my favorite."
69644,"A close friend of my mom has a daughter with two masters degrees, Art History and Art Education. The best she could find in art was giving kids tours one day per week. It was unfortunate :/"

69653,"You actually have to have a Masters to be a priest, and seminary (priest school) usually takes 6-8 years. If you go to seminary straight out of high school, you go to what's called minor seminary for about 4 years and get your BA in philosophy. Then you go to major seminary for 3-4 years (4-6 if you already have your BA) and get your Masters. Your Masters is in Theology/Divinity and you have a concentration in a variety of fields such as Scripture, Church History, Systematic Theology, Moral Theology, etc.

Bishops and Cardinals pretty much all have doctorates. Some priests also have them, and the ones that do are likely to become bishops at some point.

Source: am Catholic, discerned the priesthood, and have friends who are priests."
69654,"Was your seminary free or less expensive than your average college? I just imagine that student loans would take a long, long time for a priest to pay off."
69655,"I ultimately didn't end up going to seminary, but seminary studies are typically covered by the diocese (a bishop has to sign off before you enter the seminary). Costs are about equal to the average tuition for any other private U.S. college, but you only have to pay for it if you end up deciding not to be a priest. You also have to be debt free in most cases before you enter the seminary"

69659,I've met with a Jesuit Priest somewhat regularly for the last few months (I am not catholic) and every conversation has resulted with me walking away with a shifted perspective on things.
69660,"I think education is one of the core values of Jesuits. That's why so many private schools (Dominican University of California, University of San Francisco, Boston College, Claremont McKenna for example) are Jesuit in nature, because they founded them!"
69661,"You're not wrong. A major source of inspiration in my life is a Jesuit priest who claims he speaks, no kidding >6 languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, Greek etc. It's been ages, he's helping out in Syria right now, practicing what he preaches."
69662,"I'm surprised *and* impressed. My old church requires zero training at all for any of the leadership positions, which I think is really detrimental to the congregations.

69663,">marriage counseling

Well, at least he'd be pretty good at getting you into a newer model."
69664,Or an old broken down model made good enough to get you off the lot
69665,As a Christian in a denomination that values education: I now refuse to attend churches where the head leadership people don't have at least a bachelors. I grew up in churches full of uneducated people in positions of power. It's as ugly as you'd expect it to be.
69666,"I'd love to hear some stories like that, if there's anything to say other than 'No one knew what they were doing and everything sucked.'"
69667,"Just a lot of spiritual abuse, bullying, ignorance, inaccurate theology. Many whom acted more as mouthpieces for Fox News than anything that's actually in the Bible. I didn't realize how bad most of this was until I began attending my (Christian) college, where my classes were taught by world-renown biblical scholars."
69668,"Most Bishops actually get doctorates, Cardinal is just another honor that only allows them to vote on the Pope along with a few different responsibilities. 

And most priests get a degree in philosophy, it makes there be fewer classes in Seminary."
69669,"It's in part an effect of the Protestant Reformation. At the time, a lot of people opposed to the Catholic church complained that ministers were not educated: barely knowing latin, not being educated in theology, some of them not even having actually read the Bible. They felt that those qualities made it so that they just did whatever more educated higher ups in the church told them to and didn't offer true religious services. Once the Reformation got going and the Catholic church figured out that there were significant problems, the Catholic counter-reformation took measures to correct them with things like establishing more seminaries and making it so that some random guy couldn't be ordained in an afternoon and making it so that priests became some of the most educated people in Europe at the time."
69670,Many of the oldest universities in Europe began as monasteries.
69671,"As a dude who has a BA in theology, I 1000000% agree with this. 

I was studying to be a catholic priest. Left seminary, but continued with my undergrad theology degree. I don't want to teach high school. I don't want to go on to get a masters and PhD so I'm not going to be a professor. I absolutely hate the way catholic youth ministry is run so I'm not going to do that. Those are my options. Fuck em all. I now teach gymnastics to preschoolers and assist with the team coaches for the older kids."

69675,"kinesiology is popular but has a very very very limited job pool, atleast where I live."
69676,"Kinesiology, for the most part, does a good job of preparing you for graduate school/med school/PT school etc. The problem is that only a small percentage of grads end up getting into those grad programs and a BS alone won't get you far unless your goal is to work in the fitness industry or as a PE teacher. 

What your area of study is in also matters. Biomechanics and motor behavior are probably the most lucrative in terms of careers since there's so much application to rehabilitation, device design, robotics, etc. Exercise physiology and the like not so much."
69677,"Be careful when studying music. Most universities offer Music Performance and Music Education. Getting a bacehlor's in Music Education means you're certified to teach at a school, and therefore has more potential of getting you a job. Music Performance just means you got really good at playing your instrument. You still have job options, such as giving lessons, starting your own studio, joining a professional symphony, or just being a freelance musician. But those all have varying levels of difficulty and instability. For example, to get into a symphony, you have to be the best of the best (at least for top-tier symphonies). So your probability of being hired depends solely on your audition. And to be a freelance musician means that there may be periods where you're unemployed. And even when you are hired by someone, you will go most of the time without insurance or a retirement fund. 

And then you have to factor in the location you're in. If you're in an area that's musically dry, you won't be finding any paying gigs unless you're a teacher. There may be plenty of people wanting your services, like churches, community bands, and musical pit orchestras, but you probably won't get paid."
69678,"Non-Accredited Majors.

Even if it sounds like a good degree, Mechanical Engineering for example.  It might not be accredited meaning it doesn't hold anywhere near the value.

Edit:  I only used Mechanical Engineering as an example.  This is normallt an issue with university programs that are new which means their program normally wouldn't have accreditation (it is in application process).  It is quite the gamble when you are a new student because if they do not get accreditation by the time you graduate you are SOL."
69683,"This might be a dumb question, but how do I know definitively whether a major is non-accredited or not?"
69684,"Ask the school. If they are ABET accredited they will have no trouble showing it off, you should get a very firm ""yes, we are ABET accredited"" type of response. If the answer is wishy-washy and they seem to be dodging the question, they likely aren't."
69685,It's buyer beware.  Need to research.  Programs with accreditation are very open about it.  Programs not tend to hide it.
69686,"It's weird to see this concept as an European mechie, but we have a different problem with mech engineering as such. Picking a wrong specialization results in less job opportunities than literature graduates."
69687,"Major in something practical, minor in something ""fun""."

That's what my dad always taught me."
69689,"Agreed. This is actually one of the best plans.

Source: Majored in finance, am banker. Minored in Philosophy."
69690,"My daughter did that: chemistry and philosophy. But then she went to law school, and it turns out that philosophy is great preparation for law school, with courses like logic and ethics.

She's now a patent attorney (the science degree is necessary to get hired) and she's doing very well."
69691,"I double majored in criminal justice and philosophy. I wanted to go to law school, so I figured CJ would be good for that, and I thought philosophy was fun. 

Turns out CJ was pointless for law school, and philosophy turned out to be great for preparing for it. The majority of the LSAT is straight up logic. Guess what you learn in philosophy? Logic."
69692,"I can't count the number of CJ majors I know who burned out of law school.

Honestly, if law school's your goal, 1) God help you, and 2) Pick something that's applicable elsewhere and minor in philosophy, especially logic and reasoning courses. Also pick up some political science so you at least understand how laws are made."
69695,"Don't worry, they'll tell you."
69696,Elaborate? Is this something to avoid or something to pursue?
69697,"Pursue, I'd assume. Your major matters much much more than a minor when it comes to employment. If you can find something you enjoy through a minor in college then that's great. 

My brother for example majored in Comp Sci but did a minor in Music Technology. Semi related, but he's working cyber security for a bank now not a music tech thing lol. He just always enjoyed audio engineering and stuff so he decided to add a minor for that for fun. If you're gonna pay a shit ton of money for a school then you might as well add something you enjoy."
69698,"I mean, ideally you'd be majoring in something you enjoy doing too."
69699,"It's what I did - worked well. I majored in Finance and minored in Poetry. They don't go together but it kept the creative part of my mind stimulated, and I've actually found it useful in my career as I often write presentations/policy that benefit from the composition aspect."

69703,"Biology, unless you want to go to med/pharm/vet school or graduate school. A BS in Biology won't get you very far and you'll max out in earning potential early on. A lot of bio majors go back for their MS or PhD because they're stuck at a low pay scale.  If you already know that's what you want to do, you're fine. Make sure you do a BS and not a BA though."
69704,"I'm starting to think that most degrees are like this now.  It's like a bachelor's is the new HS diploma. So many people have bachelor's degrees these days, that they're not worth what they used to be."
69705,"Yup! Has to be job specific now.  Just a degree doesn't get you anywhere... maybe 30 years ago it would've. If I had to do it over, I would spend 4 years at a junior college taking everything they offered until I was sure what industry or field truly interested me."
69706,"> because they're stuck at a low pay scale

If they want to work on the technical side, yes. The business side (Sales, project/product management, field applications, etc for biotech and pharma) want people with biology-related degrees and experience, and they do quite well for themselves compared to a research associate"
69708,Yuuuuup. The S part of STEM is a pretty big trap nowadays...
69710,"I think a lot of students get ""stuck"" in bio because they started off as premed, got a C in chemistry, realized they aren't competitive for med school, but they're 2 years in and don't want to switch majors because they already have so many bio classes completed. I'm teaching intro bio and 90% of my students are pre-med. Maybe  1/5 of them will get into med school? :("
69711,Such is life.
69712,"In my first year in science (In my school science majors aren't chosen until your second year really so it was all students) the assistant dean asked the entire year to raise their hands if they were trying to get into med school. Literally 4/5 of everyone did it in a like 300 person room. He then told us that historically, one or two of us would actually get in."

69715,">I haven't seen it posted but I'm curious, is an Environmental Science degree worth anything? It's what I'm going for and I was looking at getting a job working in national forests. 

Environmental science is a big field which can be a double-edged sword. People with more specific degrees in things like forestry, hydrology, or fish&wildlife or will beat you out for jobs unless your summer jobs / internships are more directly related to forestry.

Of course, getting a more generalized degree can be a good thing because it gives you more flexibility if you decide to do something other than foresty.

I I think it's a great degree, it just requires a little planning ahead."
69716,"Don't do something you dislike because you think it's a good career path. Work is going to be a major part of your life, so aiming for something that you can't stand doing is a bad idea."
69717,"I’m fighting with that, sort of. I decided to major in something I love, but I hate it now because it’s becoming a career instead of a hobby. The career I want is generally lower pay, but I’d rather major in that because I’d actually be happy."

69721,"I don't read this sort of advice as ""do something you hate"", but avoid the *trap* of major in some subject just because you like it.  That's fantastically bad advice for a whole host of reasons 

* low skill level.  I have an interest in chemistry.  I'm not that good at it.  Me taking out huge loans to major in chemistry is going nowhere.

* low demand for that skill.  For example, very few people hire philosophers, so you can get really good at that, and still not have the job later.  

* need for a particular set of soft skills to really be successful.  You can't be a good salesman if you aren't outgoing and charismatic.  It just doesn't happen.  You can't be a good accountant if you aren't extremely detailed.  You can't be a good artist if you lack entrepreneurial skills (because your work is its own small business).  

* the job might require sacrifices that you can't afford to make.  The high end jobs are mostly in coastal cities.  If you can't or won't move there, you might as well forget about it.  Google isn't going to have you telecommute from rural Alabama.  And some jobs require huge commitment-- 80 hour weeks, being on call, etc.  if you don't want that, you can't be in that industry.  

* the environment might not be good.  You can't expect to work the trades without lifting heavy things and working outside.  You can't expect to spend lots of time outdoors if you're a secretary.  You can't expect alone time in retail, or lots of socializing in forestry."

69727,"I work at a courthouse, and I never graduated college. Most of the new people are trying to get in with criminal justice degrees because it will look good on their resume, and there are a TON of people applying with that major. Very competitive."
69728,"I've heard the same thing from people in government agencies. A *ton* of people think ""I want to be in the FBI, so I'll major in criminal studies!"" Sounds fairly straightforward. But the problem is that you're now competing with everyone in the country with the exact same thought process."
69729,"It's not always just about the major, but what else you do in school. I got my degree in anthropology, which as a bachelor's doesn't mean much in itself, but I managed to get into courses where I did actual research and got my name co-published in a couple professional journals. That was something I've been able to market to employers as much if not more than the degree.

Same goes for something often bad mouthed like women's studies. I have two close friends who went that route, and both are employed in careers. Women's studies, not STEM, prepared them to go on to get social work degrees, which is where they now make their living."
69730,"Agreed. College is the epitome of YMMV. An in-demand major helps, but doesn't mean jack if you don't put in the work to network and intern. A shitty degree held by someone who did internships for at least the latter half of their education will be looked at better than a ""good"" degree holder with no experience.

Maybe not *avoid* it, but make sure you have an idea of what you like at the beginning or early as possible, and tailor your work experience, classes, training, etc. to that specialty.

For example, if you like prosthetics, have things that show you are ready to compete with Mechanical and Electrical engineers over the same position, and that your biology/anatomy knowledge gives you an edge over them. 

All other engineers have obvious fields they can go into. Biomed is simply just not as fleshed out and employees may just pick grads with majors they fully understand. 

In my undergrad, I went more of the bioinformatics route and did a lot of coding, so I load up my resume with that stuff and had 2 internships that furthered my coding ability. But would it have been easier if I just did Computer Engineering? Possibly."

Design is very subjective. No matter what jargon pro designers may throw at you about color theory and the golden ratio, when it comes down to you finding a job, it's all about if the employer likes what they see.  

The current industry is being devalued by sites like fiverr and 99designs where companies will pay pennies to get a logo or a flyer made. This make companies not value or need in house designers. 

Design agencies are very stuck up and the culture is almost always cut throat. 

The pay sucks. Depending on your city the entry level pay can fluctuate, but you will be making nowhere near the money you could be with other forms of education. 

You most likely will not be doing what you love unless you get lucky. If you become an in-house designer be prepared to only design stuff related to whatever your company specializes in for the rest of your employment there. If you're hired at an agency, you will have more opportunities to work on different brands, but may not be the brands you're interested in."
69753,Also the degree seems to not mean much by itself. I have hired a hand full of graphic designers and have never once asked if they have a degree. I only care about their portfolio and work ethic.
69755,"I'm planning on going to law school at the university where I'm getting my undergrad. One of their recommended degrees is Letters, which is a combination of history, English, and philosophy with both modern and ancient languages thrown in for fun. I'm also doing a political science minor. Seriously....don't do a poly sci major if you want to go to college. It doesn't teach the logic or technical writing skills needed to succeed on the LSAT or in law school."
69756,"First of all, almost every major is useless if you can't show employers what you learned with it (i.e internships, publications, research, papers/projects beyond what is expected of a college assignment, ect.). Also, you may have the risk of making your degree useless If you want to stay in a certain area. In doing so you are limiting your job prospects in that industry. For example you major in art history, but their is only one art muesum in the state and you don't want to leave the state. 

Second, most majors themselves have some degree of usefulness. Supposedly useless majors such as philosophy, history, psyc can be great prep for an advanced grad school degree like pre-law or other intensive writing/research degrees. Others like English, Classics, Journalism show that you can write well which is always valuable, and can lead to jobs in copywriting, editing, ect. 

That being said, their are some degrees I would not recommend getting: 

*Sports Management*: Coming from someone that worked at the highest levels of athletics, a sports management degree is useless. While their are jobs in sports (they just require you to grind and they are really competitive to get) I know for a fact that hiring managers don't give a shit what degree you have (except for like athletic training). They just care about your experience. So sports management itself doesn't get you hired, and it eliminates career options if a career in sports doesn't work out. Its also getting a rep that it is an ""easy major,"" in which I agree is the case with about 98 percent of sports management programs. Again, going to what I said earlier using the art history example, probably isn't a good idea to major in sports management if you attend a small private NAIA school in the middle of Iowa. 

Other useless majors include *dance/ballet* if you have a bad knee or back. And *African American Studies from North Carolina* (google UNC academic scandal)."
69757,If you don't like shit ton of physics or if you're not atleast somewhat good in it don't go into lucrative engineering fields because there's a very high chance you will switch out. If you're in it only for the money there's a big wake up call heading for you
69758,"The one where your entry level salary will be more than what you owe total in student loans (that's what my loan officer told me in the late 1990's). Your major is what is going to help you make money throughout your life, keep your hobbies out of it or make it a minor."
69759,Is this even possible today?
69760,"You have to be smart about it. My degree in a STEM field had an average starting salary around $50K when I went to school. Over four years I went in-state, did Community College for 1.5 years to get the 'basic' classes out of the way cheaper, and then went hard for the nest 2.5 years. I ended up with about $35K in loans that I will be done paying off this December, basically 15 years early. I also paid about 15% more each month than the minimum to eat the principal away quicker. You need to sacrifice a little and be smart about planning, but it can be done with the right major."
69761,"I've seen a lot of ""Foreign language unless you double major"" Nobody has yet mentioned that Japanese isn't a happy life. Period. 

There is literally thousands of other westerners pining for that English teaching job in Japan and they treat you like dirt when you get there."
69762,"In the UK - if you can afford not to, don't do law. Many law firms I stumbled across prefer non-law rigorous degrees (linguistics, maths, hard science) and a conversion to law. If you get good enough grades, you might be able to get your degrees for free because some firm or Inn of Court will pay for it. If you want to do IP law, just do science. Whatever area of science you graduate from is the area that you can do patents. Also, you can work in the patents office. If you don't want to do law, you will always get asked the question as to why you studied law and you are not trying to work in law (as I got when trying to get a job in PR).

Finally, if you want to be a solicitor forget the LPC. A new 'super exam' is coming out in 2020 and you won't need to spend £10-20k on the LPC to qualify. You will, however, still need 2 years' work experience so get that now."
69763,"Don’t go to college unless you know what you want to do. We’ve been looking at this all wrong. 

Start with where you want to be in 10-15 years and then work backwards. What’s between you and that place?

If college is one of those things, then go to college. 

Looking at it the wrong way is how we’ve ended up with $1 trillion in student loan debt. Don’t just go to college for the sake of going to college. It would literally be cheaper to travel around the world. And you’d learn more."

""No""

""None.  Real Jews study law, medicine, or finance."""
69768,Was gonna say that I'm Jewish and majored in Political Science and Criminology. Then I remembered I'm in law school...
69769,Most Jews studied Judaism *their entire lives.*
69770,None will make you earn anything.  They may allow you to do so if you're able to do the work.  Doing something you like is a better recipe.
69771,"While I agree that no degree will guarantee you a lucrative job, I think it's important to point out that not everyone has a field of interest that can be readily commercialized.  OP might love medieval poetry, but the reality is that there's not much market demand for people with expertise analyzing themes in 12th century literature.  At the end of the day, he has to weigh that interest against the possibility (or probability) that he'll not only have few job prospects at the end of those four years, but also have tens of thousands of dollars of debt.

I definitely don't think you should do something you hate, or in which you have no talent, but I do think that ""doing something you like"" needs to be tempered by an element of pragmatism.  As rough as engineering was sometimes, I think my adult life would have been even rougher had I gone the liberal arts route."
69772,"A degree isn’t a ticket to a guaranteed income. STEM fields and computer science are good bets now, but not if you’re not good at those things, or if you’re not interested in them.

Choose something you’re good at and passionate/interested in."
69773,+1 on this!  Interviewing potential software engineering interns. So many were not interested in their software engineering field! “Stop wasting your time and money!”
69774,"~~STEM~~ TEM fields and computer science are good bets now

Physical science fields do not pay well.  And certainly do not pay well compared to engineering, technology, and often math (though math is a risk itself).

Chemistry, biology, biochemistry, physics, microbiology, etc. salaries are trash.  Examples of well paying jobs in those fields are highly anecdotal and do not take into account the hundreds of people that wanted that job and did not get it."
69775,"Agree, and wish someone told me this a decade or so ago. ""Research Associate"" and ""QA/QC tehnician"" are the most common jobs for a BS in chemistry/biology, but they cap out around 40k these days. It's hard to fidn these jobs too, because unless you go for an advanced degree, thats the only real jobs you qualify for."
69776,"Can confirm. Was scientist, now engineer. Engineer easier and pays better."
69777,"passion doesn't pay bills. usually tech companies ask for ""insanely passionate"" people. translation: workaholics."
69778,"No, but neither does a piece of paper with some words on it. 

I would hope that these tech companies are also looking for people who are good at whatever they’re hiring for, and are actually interested in their job."
69779,"Tech companies are not expressly looking for workaholics.  Sure, it's great if we have people who work hard, and we want people who are motivated and so on.  We even want people who will work long hours at times (and they get paid a commensurate salary).

But when we ask for passion, we're looking for people who are excited about the domain they're in, and who draw meaning from accomplishing something in that domain.  Those people will be the ones who come up with the best and most innovative solutions.  They're the ones who are willing and able to tackle a problem that other people say is too hard.  Or who will raise the bar on what is ""good enough"", and not settle for status quo.  Now obviously passion alone isn't sufficient for this - we're actually looking for passion and brilliance - but those two often go hand in hand.

Those qualities are much more important than being a workaholic, and we will bias towards those every day of the week."
69780,"Of course they do. People with passion tend to do the best. The guy that spends his free time building up a home lab at home and writing code for open source projects is probably going to do a better job than the guy that views tech as a way to make a lot of money, but then doesn't put in any effort outside of work.

I've noticed it a lot when I interview. Confidence + eagerness to learn + seeming excited about the job are the things that seemed to have the biggest impact on receiving an offer."
69781,"Be wary of the popular advice on this thread: ""Major in anything STEM."" I'd put my money on the majority of FI people on this forum are STEM folks who sit in front of their computers all day, hating their jobs... but thats another topic all together. I think Reddit threads in are generally a bad place for these kinds of questions because of selection bias. Just wanted you to keep that in mind. There is plenty of good news for a lot of STEM majors, but not all of them. You can find a lot of articles supporting STEM. Here are some contrary to consider: 

https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm -- Key point: Surplus in academia STEM.
http://www.businessinsider.com/college-majors-producing-the-highest-unemployment-rates-2017-10 -- Key point: Biology and Environmental Science majors have some of the highest unemployment rates.
https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-130.html -- Key point: Majority of STEM graduates do not work in STEM 

In my opinion, you should consider if you really love a STEM field? Are you good at math? Do you like using a computer for the majority of the day? If not, there are a plentitude of opportunities out there, with only an undergraduate degree being the minimum qualification."
69782,100% agree. There is a huge surplus in stem. There was a paper regarding surplus and shortage of stem. Cause they want someone from Harvard to do their lab technician Jobs and anyone lesser than that will just have to work at mcdolands.
69783,"Double major in computer science and finance. Unless you have the ability to become a neurosurgeon, this is the answer."
69784,"Becoming a neurosurgeon would probably be the worst way to FIRE... 4 years undergrad, 4 years medical, 3 years neuro residency, 3 years surgical residency, 3 years neruosurgical residency... if starting at 18, and never you never meander, you dont earn your 800k/year until your 35, and by that time, your student loans (which you have been making small payments on during a million years of residency) have probably balooned to 500k.

Fuck neurosurgery"
69785,"You can pay off your entire student loans in one year if you wanted. But yes, of course, you don't go into neurosurgery expecting it to be easy and to want to FIRE. You do it because you have a sick passion and don't give a shit about sleep. My brother's girlfriend is a neurosurgery resident. She can't stay awake for more than 10 minutes when watching a tv show or movie on her maybe 2 days off a month."
69786,No you couldnt... the interest alone on 500k would be like 3.5k a month... and earning 800k/year would mean your taking home around 450k a year after taxes and 401k
69787,You’re just being pedantic now. The point is that student loans are not an issue for those who manage to actually make to the true neurosurgeon point.
69788,"I think the point is that neurosurgery is a terrible way to fire... great way to earn a fuckload of money later in life... but spend your time from age 22 to 35 studying or working 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week? Not to mention, if you spent all that time learning such a specialized skill that society is in need of, when there is only so many available slots for residencies... probably feel guilty when hanging up your spurs... people that goninto neurosurgery are not the fire type"
69789,"Thought questions!

100 18 year old kids want to be a neurosurgeon, how many make it?

100 18 year old kids want to be software developers, how many make it?"
69790,That's why I said *ability* to become a neurosurgeon.
69791,"Less than one.

50?"
69792,"Indeed!  I think you're being gracious on the less than one too!

Hence also why software development for the ""young person who hasn't gone to college yet"" is such the better choice.

People always like to throw around surgeons and investment bankers as great choices... which for a CERTAIN SUBSET of people that is true... it's just that random run of the mill 17 year old is UNLIKELY to belong to that subset.

It's like saying, ""Hey want to FI?  You should be a professional football player or CEO of a fortune 500 company and not blow all your money.""

I'll get RIGHT ON THAT."

69797,Finance and economics will tend to earn high salaries over time
69798,"Best advice I can give is find a job (or field) that you think you'll enjoy and excel at, then work backwards from there. Once you have an endpoint, think of the degree that will best get you there. 

The type of degree obviously matters but you also have to consider your interests. If you don't enjoy programming you probably won't be very successful with a computer science degree, or you'll end up hating your job which will make the marginal difference in salary not worth it."
69799,Registered nurses make a lot (2 year associates degree). Finance degree (never not going need that). Civil or mechanical engineering for obvious reasons. Chemistry majors tend to end up in the pharmaceutical industry (unsure if you'll actually need a MS degree later instead of just BS degree). Business management degree.
69800,"I did Comp Sci. Pay is great, but long hours and stress.

If I were to do it again, I would consider:

4 year law enforcement degree at a local school. Become a cop, work your way up. Retire in 20 years with a nice pension, move into some other career at your leisure.

Some kind of trade (plumber, electrician, welder, etc.). Do a trade program and apprentice as quickly as possible. Also do part-time school for a business degree at a local school (even just a 2 year). Grind for 10 years and then start your own shop.

Both of these offer a ""cheap"" education (no crippling debt) and aren't as susceptible to the AI/automation/robot change that will likely come during your working years."
69801,Finance
69802,"Not sure about everyone saying finance unless I'm doing it wrong...my degree in finance gets me a salary of $55k. If I could go back, would do computer science, engineering, or a trade."
69803,"Yeah bro, if you’ve got a good finance degree, you should be making twice that by your 30’s at any number of large banks"
69804,My ex has a finance degree and one of his first jobs right out of college paid him starting salary of 80k. You might want to shop around for different job if you think 55k is it for you.
69805,How are people finding these high paying jobs?
69806,Indeed.com has a lot of jobs. I think indeed is the most used job board by employers for posting their jobs. You just need to put in keywords for the job you want and be flexible with location.
69807,"I have been thinking about trade as well. People know how to code I doubt knows how to wire their house or fix their plumbing. Or better yet, they probably don't want to do that messy stuff."
69808,How long have you been working? I envy you with that much money coming in.
69809,"Something you enjoy that has a job market. Don’t spend the first half of your life miserable in the hopes of enjoying the second half. If you can’t enjoy working at least most of the time, you’re doing it wrong."
69810,"I have a liberal arts degree -- don't get one of those

and I work in IT -- do that.

because I taught myself web development & took some IT courses (programming-related ones) -- do that.


To be honest, 

Sometimes I think if I could do it all over again, spend my teens learning IT skills during summers, evenings, & weekends (basically as much as possible), then skip college and go straight to work.

But then I think... I wouldn't be the same person without the more expansive worldly & historical perspective I acquired in college.

So, I think I'd really try and combine those two--

If I ever have kids, have them go to IT camps, get IT tutors, and study whatever they want.

But at least learn the tools (IT-- I think that's where it's at b/c it empowers work to get done)"
69811,"Something you have at least 50% passion for + what everyone else has already mentioned (STEM + comp sci).

I went the MD route, but only had partial passion from the start. Yes, I makes lots of money and can live on my own, but am banging my head sometimes over why I didn't go the comp sci route (loved math, programming, and cryptography... plus computers >> humans)."
69812,Another vote for computer science here.
69813,Math
69814,"I got double major in math and physics. Insurance companies won't take me but mortgage companies will allow me to data entry though. Fml, not stem."
69815,"Surprising, insurance companies love math majors and the addition of physics with signal processing could put you in line with emerging technology development roles within said insurance firms. I would check out data scientist job reqs in insurance, find what skills are important and focus on those to start. Easier said than done, but there is high demand, RE: Hartford, CT headquartered companies."
69816,"Choosing a degree is about finding a balance between what you will enjoy and be able to do well, and what will bring you income.

Although you don't want to study something you hate just because it will help you earn a lot, if you study something that you love that brings you no income potential, you are likely to end up doing something you hate anyway, but for much less money.

The best case scenario is that you're passionate about something that has a high probability of leading you to a high income career (e.g., Computer Science today).  But for many people this isn't a reality.

What I would do is try to as much data about the earning potential of each degree, and then work your way through the list identifying the ones that you think strike the best balance between what you enjoy and are competent at, and what have the potential to bring you high income.

Also remember that college education is not the only way to secure a well-paying career.  If you are about to go into massive debt for it, it may be worth considering alternatives (e.g., electrical work, plumbing, etc...).  Personally, I am a big fan of higher education, but I was lucky enough to be in the group where my passion correlated well with a field with high earning potential.  Having watched many friends over the years, this is not always the case.

Oh, and all that other stuff about the degree not guaranteeing you anything, and it being just as much about you working hard, and having the right natural ability and skills, etc..."
69817,"Not sure about the US but there are tales of plumbers earning £100k+ in London, so if you only care about the money maybe you don't even need a degree"
69818,"Asking about the ""best"" degree is a bit silly. Earning lots of money is a very poor reason to get a higher education. Based on both of your questions, I suggest you rethink going to college at all. You're not the kind of person who could benefit from an impressive college or an impressive degree program."
69819,"MBA is probably the most consistent earner that I've seen in my career. Everyone has a BA/BS and the MBA, at least in a business environment, seems to have the most broad appeal for a variety of opportunities. I myself have a CompSci degree but found that was limiting in a business environment to CIO/CTO. 
Depends on what you want to do really..."
69820,"The degree won't do shit.. It's your ability to set yourself up in the right place, put in the work and seek the opportunities that will help you earn ""lots of money"".

Everyone here keeps saying CompSci like it's a gravy train to high salaries. The fact of the matter is, a large number of people who do CS are not qualified in any way to become software engineers - they do the degree because they think it'll set them up without putting in the work to build their resumes or get internships or do side projects. 

Aim to get into the best university you can, choose any traditional subject, think about which career path you want to go down and then execute what needs to be done to be successful in both entering that career path and progressing."
69821,Underwater basket weaving.
69822,"Computer science, Electrical engineering, or the physical sciences...but more importantly get a good internship and acquire useful skills as a student. My husband and I both work in STEM areas and have such a hard time hiring. We desperately need students who know how to do something useful coming out of undergrad, and those skills just aren't really taught in the classroom. Make the best of your education by learning how to apply every summer."
69823,"This is a terrible question and mindset. Conversely, so is picking a major solely based on what you like or for prestige. 

Pick a major based on WHERE you want to live and HOW you want to live after school. You could go learn a trade and love like a king in certain places, and you could get a STEM degree with honors and experience and live paycheck to paycheck. Any degree is only as valuable as you make it, and you make it valuable by maximizing your opportunity with location as well as living a lifestyle that fits the job and maximizes how you'd like to live. Example...medical or financial fields can make great pay, but you're going to have to get used to 60+ hour weeks."
69824,"Computer Science, Engineering, almost any STEM field..."
69825,"Computer Science and/or Engineering. I’m doing both and as an intern in college the average chap (if you did the math out on a weekly basis) will earn as much if not much more than most other majors will in their first few years after graduation. Again - there are outliers, but generally speaking we earn the most *on average* while also having some of the best demand possible for our professions."

69832,"You will forever have to hear some iteration of ""geology rocks"" and other geology puns by people not in geology.

But seriously, it's an incredibly fun major with lots of field trips and camping. Also a lot of hard work with chemistry/physics/math, but still fun. Job prospects are pretty decent, too."
69833,"I respectfully disagree - geologists subject themselves to far more puns than non-geologists could ever dream up.  Most people don't know about gneiss and schist, but geologists abuse them endlessly.  Of course, I'm totally complicit in this."

Cons: Everyone has big science beards, so yours will need to be exceptional."
69840,"It's a great major. You'll learn things about the earth you never would in any other field. Field work is fun. If your experience in it is anything like mine, be prepared to work in a lab for a lot of the first few years. Job prospects are great even with just a Bachelor's. Also, rocks are a good present to give to people if they are particularly nice, I like to give people slabs of Copper ore. It looks really nice when cut and polished and it's cool because I got it myself.

Advice: Invest in a good pair of hiking boots, a rock hammer, a hand lens, pocket knife, and a good backpack. Optionally a tent and sleeping bag and other basic camping gear because you don't want to be that guy who always asks to share a tent/ other essentials."
69841,"Just a word of warning coming from a recently graduated geologist (graduated 2013), if you have the misfortune of graduating during a market downturn things will be really difficult.  My graduating class has about a 25-30% employment rate in our chosen field.  I was lucky enough to know someone in the industry to get my foot in the door, but if I was you I would be networking as best I could during your university years and leave grad school open as an option just in case!

Otherwise, everything here checks out.  Your classmates will probably be a bunch of loveable wierdos who like to drink too much. Your profs will be awesome and field schools are tough work, but a lot of fun.  

Good luck!"

69843,"I work in private forestry.   Overall it's a good field.  Obviously you get to work in the wilderness.  I enjoy driving around and seeing some really beautiful country.  The hours are good, just early.  Earning potential is generally good but not amazing.  Timber markets can fluctuate very hard and make job security not the best, depending on who you work for.  I'd say just be absolutely sure you love working outside, rain or shine.  Days where you are working on a steep ass slope, crawling through thorny underbrush in the rain can be really taxing.  On the other hand, good days make it feel like you've got the best job in the world."
69844,"So you said you work outside, see beautiful scenery, work in the rain, crawl through bushes, but can you explain more of what you actually do? Like, what is a typical day for you? I've been interested in forestry for a long time, but I've never really been sure of what I could do with it."
69845,"Sent you a pm.

*Edit.  Sorry, sadly a lot of people these days don't understand or have a negative perception of forestry so I was hesitant to ramble about it.

My experience is a bit different than the usual.  I work for a very small company, so I end up doing a little bit of everything whereas most foresters work for a government entity (Forest Service, BLM, State Forestry) or a timber company and specialize in one or two areas.

Here are some common duties.

* Cruising, if necessary.  This is estimating the volume of timber in the forest using data collection and statistics.

* Unit Layout. Finding and marking property lines, which is often not easy in the middle of nowhere.  If no monuments exist, they need to be surveyed in.  Evaluating access.  If necessary, designing roads and/or obtaining permission to use a neighbor's property.  Protecting sensitive areas from logging operations, such as streams, wet areas, unstable areas, and certain wildlife species.

* Permitting.  This is highly dependent on the state you're working in and its forest policies.

* Logging Bidding.  Finding loggers, showing them the project.  Evaluating bids in regard to cost, timeliness, experience, equipment, availability, etc.

* Timber Marketing.  Timber mills are all different and specialize in processing different species and different sizes of timber.  Working with mills to find maximum value in terms of price they are willing to pay and the cost it takes to transport those logs


* Contract Management.  Checking on the project to make sure all of the above is getting executed properly and timely.

* Reforestation.  Finding seedlings, supervising the planting process, deciding on any herbicides that need to be applied to slow growth of competing species.

* This is the industry side of forestry.  There are many other jobs, like working for the state ensuring people are following rules, fighting forest fires, being a park ranger, studying ecology/hydrology/etc.

[OSU](http://www.forestry.oregonstate.edu/academic-programs/undergraduates/undergraduate-majors) has a pretty good breakdown of different forestry focuses and careers.  There are many jobs that don't require a degree, though."

69848,"Pro: Very interesting material, especially if its a topic you like.
Its similar skills as a history degree but more marketable.

Con: Be prepared to work in NYC, DC, or abroad cause thats where pretty much all the IR jobs are. Also can be a pro, depends on how you feel about living there.
Not a bad job market but not great either, it can be tough to break into.
Use as many connections as you can to land a job"

-study abroad as much as you can

-internships every summer

-learn a foreign language

-specialize in a region of the world (preferably Asia or the Middle East)

-ideally, match your specialization with your study abroad experience and language choice (ex - if you want to focus on the Middle East, study in the Middle East/North Africa and study Arabic)


Pros:

-flexible, more so than poli sci; you can get a lot of the poli sci jobs with International Relations but can also market it to businesses, schools, and non-profits; you can do this with a poli sci, but in my experience having the more international focus tends to draw more attention

-interesting, relevant subject material

-makes study abroad much easier credit-wise

Cons:

-you'll probably end up working abroad/in DC 

-you'll most likely work for the government or a non-profit (although businesses might take you, especially you have honed your language skills), meaning the pay isn't that fantastic

-it's so broad it's hard to narrow down what you want to focus on"

69852,"Piggy backing on this comment. Some of your course work will be insane, but stay on top of it. Also, keep your nose clean and go after jobs that require a security clearance (any level). You will probably not be a millionaire in this field, but you should be very comfortable.

edit: thank you so much for all the advice! I know it won't be easy but hey, no pain no gain right :P I'm actually going to work really hard on my math now after this. And if I slack, I'll just go back to this page and re-read everything."
69855,"Astronomer here!  Good for you! :) Warning: it is *really* hard.  And incredibly competitive at every level, for little pay compared to what you'd get in industry.

That said, I rather love what I do, and can't believe I get paid for it, so ask if you have any questions! (Edit: for those interested, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/31omlf/so_you_want_to_be_an_astronomer/) is a good post to get you started on what astronomers do, and how to become one...)

Edit 2: some of my personal pros and cons from further downstream

Pros: getting paid to increase my level of understanding about the universe, teaching is a joy, as is writing, and my colleagues are incredibly wonderful.  And when it works *wow*, there's nothing cooler than knowing something in the universe no one else knows!

Cons: stuff doesn't work a *lot* so everything takes way longer than you think it will, I don't like programming but really need to do a decent amount of it, and sometimes the people I work with can be incredibly frustrating (amazingly, not always completely different people from those listed under the pros)"
69856,"A few of the perks, according to my astrophysics prof:

1. When astronomers get together, they drink.

2. The higher altitude of most observatories means getting drunk is cheaper.

3. The drink helps you forget how little you're getting paid for this."
69857,"Mechanical Engineering

edit: I appreciate all the answers! If it can help narrow things down, I specifically want to work with cars.

69858,"Been doing it for a few years, graduated in 2009

Pros: Great pay, constant need for work, lots of options, fun work.

Cons: There is also a lot of competition, given how popular engineering is right now. College really doesn't prepare you like I think it should, you need real life experience before you'll truly be helpful."
69859,"I've had my degree for seven years. One of the biggest benefits is that mechanical engineering can be used in every industry and there is a wide variety of jobs available. The downside is that once you graduate and get that first job, it is very hard to get into a different industry or a different role in the same industry.

Let's say you graduate and start working in the manufacturing division of a medical device manufacturer. After a few years it grows boring and you want to try something else. Want to work as a designer for a car company? You have no chance of landing that job. You are considered to have the same experience as somebody fresh out of college for that job, but will be needing a bigger salary to match your raises at your previous job. The only way to move from one industry to another would be a similar role in the new industry (manufacturing engineer of medical devices to manufacturing engineer of automobiles). Even then, it can still be difficult. Sure, the overall goals of reducing scrap, increasing production, etc. will still be the same. However, each industry will be held to different regulations that somebody with a few years experience will be expected to know. 

To move to a different role, the easiest way is to take a new position within your company (manufacturing engineer of medical devices to design engineer of medical devices). However, if you are unhappy with the industry you are in this solves nothing. 

I don't mean to use this to discourage you to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, just a word of caution for when you are graduating and looking for that first job. If you need further examples, look into job postings for Mechanical Engineering jobs that require a few years of job experience. The specific requirements listed will show you how difficult it can be to land the job without experience in that field."
69860,"Just graduated last week.

Pros: Great starting pay. Lots of jobs. Interesting and challenging work. 

Cons: You will work  a lot harder than your friends in school. 

It will definitely be worth it in the end! I highly recommend it!"
69861,What job opportunities are there?
69862,"Look around the room you're in. 

Nearly everything you see came across a mechanical engineers desk in some stage of development."
69863,"There are tons of job opportunities for Mechanicals specifically.  It's the broadest field of engineering.  You could do anything from programming an automated assembly line, sitting on a computer designing, being out on a factory floor troubleshooting a problem, basically anything...  I just graduated last week from Missouri S&T, it is VERY uncommon for a Mechanical to graduate without a job lined up.  I highly recommend it."
69865,It becomes very proof heavy and theoretical. It's almost like another language.
69866,"I just found some of my 400 level algebra and analysis notebooks and flipped through them.  I can't believe that I could ever understand that stuff, let alone successfully complete 20-something credits in the pure math emphasis.  The coder that sits next to me at work couldn't even grasp that .9 repeating = 1."
69867,"Mathematics student here, here's my input:

Pros:

- There seems to be many post-college options, especially if you have to learn programming as well like we do here.

- If you like challenges and love math, it can be very enjoyable at times

- Not that many people want to study just mathematics in college, most take CS or something like that instead, thus, you will have classes that very few people attend, the ones only for math students. Which can be quite fun compared to the huge lectures that have hundreds of students attending. You'll also get more personal attention.

Cons:

- It's hard, often really hard. Even if you were good at math in high school. Being good at math in high school helps but does not guarantee that you will do well when you major in math, especially if you are used to just memorizing a lot of stuff. 

- No matter how much you like maths, some of the material will be boring. Math requires a lot of precision, thus there are so many little details to remember about everything that can make a beautiful theorem seem quite boring. And those little details must not be missed, ever.

- Mathematicians tend to be very strict, I have classes where you can absolutely not redo a test, even if you are sick that day. And details matter, you will lose points on tests even if you understand the general idea but miss details.

- You'll have very little free time, there is a ton of homework and a lot of classes (I just had two big tests today and an exam yesterday). In many majors, you will just have lectures, in math, you will have lectures and classes to practice mathematics. My roommate literally has half as many hours I have that she has to spend at school and very little homework while I also have a lot of homework which is often quite challenging. There is a lot of information to learn and unlike many other majors, math requires a lot of practice.

- (can be a pro, depending on the person!) It is nothing like math in high school, it will be a whole different kind of mathematics. Like one of my professors says ""Mathematics is the art of proofs"". There is a lot of proofs and you have to think about maths very differently.

Overall, I am very happy with my choice to study mathematics but it is not for everyone."
69868,"Pro: Post college options

Cons: Tons of homework"
69869,"Environmental Science

Edit: thank you all for your replies and comments. I will be saving this comment thread as a reference during my college career. I really appreciate the time you all put in to comment"
69870,"Learn GIS and basic computer science.

Thank me later.

I knew a ton of Environmental majors in College. You will want to learn that technology , specifically ArcMap"
69871,"High Schoolers -- please consider a career in public health sciences! There is an enormous need for epidemiologists and biostatisticians, particularly ones with up-to-date coding and analysis skills. Data drives policy and great data can save lives."
69873,"College does help, but don't waste your money going to any big shot art institute. Really look at what your college options are what kind of program they offer, I'd say their web classes are a good indications of how up to date they are with current trends and development.

My college had a decent design program but shitty web classes, pretty much had to teach myself web after I graduated.

In the end though what really matters is the quality of your work. So try to find inspiration from everything. Also finding a job right out of college can be a real bitch unless you have excellent talent and networking skills. But don't expect to get the job your looking for right away.

Also I wouldn't limit yourself to just UI design. Yes UI design is getting huge, but that's just a small portion of what most employers look for. There's print, web, identity, illustration, etc... I have heard it's good to focus, but don't ignore these other areas."
69874,"Graphic designer here! I'm four years post design school, and I can say there are a lot of pros and not that many cons.

Pros: Good money, especially if you're in UI. Fun, interesting work that changes all the time (my clients range from the food industry to healthcare, to non profit, and almost every other thing you can think of). Very satisfying work--solving problems is fun!

Cons / Words of wisdom: Make sure you go to a school that focuses on a design CAREER, not one that only encourages you to express yourself artistically though design. I have friends that went to the second kind, and most of them are at shitty in-house jobs because they didn't know how to capitalize on their skills or deal with real clients."
69875,"Accounting, I've always heard it's a safe bet

Thanks for the info everyone"
69876,"1) /r/accounting - there are many stickied/sidebar posts to help you out there.

Pros: 

* The field is transferable to wherever you want to live

* Wide variety of fields/specializations to work in

Cons:

* The work will be boring when you first start out"
69877,r/accounting is like a cult for the big 4 accounting firms.
69878,"It's an echo of what is being preached at colleges and universities all over.  They only push Big 4, and as a result, a majority of the posts on the sub are from college kids trying to get a little bit of understanding about the Big 4.  There are, however, decent occasional posts where people talk about jobs outside the Big 4."
69879,"Be prepared for a shit storm of work. I'm studying for the CPA right now and it's more work than anything I did in college (and that says a lot). Accounting is a lot of work and even more work in the real world, but it can be rewarding"
69880,"Accountant here.

It is indeed a safe bet. While the job security is good, what's even better is that there's always tons of job openings for CPAs. The pay is decent, not amazing, but for most people it's going to get you a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. 

HOWEVER, the hours are very, very long. The vast majority of accountants work a ton of unpaid overtime, they come in just behind lawyers and doctors in terms of work hours, but on average, they also make a lot less than lawyers and doctors. 

Yes, the work is boring, really damn boring. In fact, I think that fact is key to the success of the profession. If this work wasn't so damn boring, people would just do it themselves and the wages in this profession would plummet. Because accounting isn't hard, there's a  lot of material to memorize at first, but it's not terribly difficult or complex. It's just time-consuming and boring to get through, and that's why accountants get paid what they do, because they're the people with the patience and tolerance for boredom to actually pay attention to the little details and technicalities.

On the plus side, accounting does at least get to dip their nose in everything. It doesn't require much math, but it takes a lot of professional writing to pump out memos, policies, reports, presentations, etc. You'll do a little project management to manage all the projects that inevitably pop up, particularly for system add-ons, integrations, and/or replacements. You'll need at least some familiarity with IT to get a sense for the company's ERP flows and ensuring we keep it all contained in a solid control environment. You'll chitchat with sales and departmental heads on how things are going with the business to help improve the accuracy of financial forecasts, etc. etc.

You'll also deal with some resentment though, because anytime you show your face, it means it's time to deal with some meaningless numbers bullshit that doesn't actually matter (at least not to them!), but you need to force those conversations anyway. Even after you're not doing audit anymore, accounting/finance people still get painted as the ""bad guy"" in a lot of these situations, so you also need people skills to try to ensure everybody feels like we're on the same team, and make sure that those annoyed people still get you the deliverables you need and respect your timelines. 

If you want to get a reliable fast-track to a successful career start in public accounting with the big 4. You will work OBSCENE hours, literally over 100+hours a week, for weeks on end, and you'll be paid less than what you'd make in private accounting. But you learn incredibly fast, and most companies will specify an expected # of years of public accounting experience for their open positions. Then when you finally leave public accounting for private accounting, you work much more reasonable hours and get paid a whole lot more. It IS possible to be promoted up from within private accounting, but it'll take longer to move up. Public accounting moves you up so quickly because if you're not promotion material, they'll fire you to make way for others (but most just leave of their own volition for better pay and hours). 

____________________________
**EDIT:** To expand on the demand for CPAs, after my initial applications to intern with a public accounting firm, I didn't have to send out resumes anymore. After working in public accounting, you WILL be headhunted constantly with recruiters trying to fill positions. You'll also have agencies trying to lure you away from your job, they'll show you a list of open jobs their clients have (the companies that are hiring), and then you tell them which ones they can show your resume to. The hiring company pays the agent a percentage of what your salary will be, so it's in the agent's interest to get you matched and for as much as possible. 

This means a ton of the job hunting is handled by someone else for free, plus those agents will also get same-day feedback from the hiring company after an interview, to find out whether or not they like you and why. For my last job change a year ago, of the 4 companies I allowed my agent to apply to, 3 wanted to interview, and I got 2 job offers plus a counter-offer from my current employer. I told the 3 companies what kind of competing offers I had and asked for their best and final bid and I simply took the highest.  (You can also skip the whole agency process and just apply to positions directly, and then the hiring company can apply the budget for agency fees towards giving you a bigger signing-bonus.)"
69881,Playing it safe is the most accountant way you could choose to become an accountant. It's self selection into boredom.
69883,All the students want to do game dev.  All the pros want to stay the hell away from it.
69885,"software dev here. When people say they want to become a game developer, what they really mean is they want to become a hobby game developer - have the means to make your ideas reality without any of the crunch times, deadlines, mountain of bugs, etc... as long as you don't care about making a single cent off your game."
69886,"That's exactly my case. I started programming to learn to make games, realized that doing it for a job wasn't a great idea, became a developer, eventually stopped doing it for a job, but all the while I kept game dev as a hobby and still enjoy it even if I don't make any money from it.

Edit: Just want to clarify: I don't see game development as a lesser job. I know people who truly enjoy the job. Hell, John Carmack is one of my idols. I just realized early on that I personally did not want that career."
69888,"I used to be a programmer for a large Healthcare Software company, and I can tell you it's one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. The hours aren't bad, the pay definitely wasn't bad for someone coming straight out of college, and the benefits were the best I've ever seen (pretty much every medical procedure was 100% covered), and the campus was like a playground. Not kidding, I took a slide to my office every morning and there were indoor bags sets and pool tables we could play with during the day.

The only reason I left was because I got engaged and needed to move back home :(

Oh yeah, and saving people and stuff is good too. If you have the drive to help people medically but you can't deal with the blood and the needles and stuff this is the job for you.

Edit: I got a lot of questions, so here are the goddamn answers.

Yes. I worked at Epic in Wisconsin.

I actually majored in Industrial Engineering in college, programming was more of a hobby of mine but I applied to Epic on a whim (one of those ""Why not?"" things). During the hiring process they don't focus on your knowledge of programming, rather they test your logic skills and analyze how you think about things, the philosophy being that if they find someone who can think the right way the programming language can be taught later.

Epic is always looking for new developers, the healthcare industry is really stable and growing (everyone needs healthcare) so Epic is constantly hiring new people. As long as you fit their criteria (see above: testing testing testing) it's pretty easy to get in.

Epic has lots of different teams, for example they have ASAP which is their ER application, Beaker which is their lab app, etc. Your work load largely depends on what application you are placed under. I was placed in Tapestry, which is the application for insurance claims and other insurance related stuff. While it wasn't as interesting as other applications the work load was very manageable. I can't say I ever worked more than 45 hours a week and normally just 40.

Epic's dress code is something to the effect of ""when customers are around wear clothes."" So basically literally wear whatever you want that's appropriate. I usually wore jeans and a hoodie. They also have very flexible hours. I usually worked from 10-6 but I had friends who would do 6-2. No one really keeps track of when you come and leave, just as long as you get your work done.

I would definitely recommend this job. Laid back environment and a very rewarding career."

Code as much as you can outside of courses- when it comes time to get a job, very few companies will ask you about the calculus and discrete math you learned, but they will give you a problem and tell you to solve it in whatever language they use, and ask about the frameworks and DBs you're familiar with (which do not tend to get adequate coverage in school by default)

Edit: the best comparison I can make is music. If you go to music school, you already love music and play an instrument/create it. That's how you get paid gigs. Schooling is there to enable your understanding of what's happening when you play.. But at no point do you stop practicing. If you don't love coding outside of school, it's going to be difficult to be successful"
69895,"There is a lot more math involved in this major than you would expect.

Edit: I'm talking about the major takes a lot of math classes not the industry just to clarify"
69897,"Although you will have to do calculus/applied math, for most CS majors the hardest part of your university career is the theoretical/discrete math portion. 

EDIT: Holy cow the amount of discrete math hate is real."
69898,"Right? All these other guys are like calculus/linear algebra/diffyQ etc. Like no shit, everyone at my school takes those. CS also as algorithms/discrete math/combinatorics/prob&stats, maybe some relational algebra, lots and lots of stuff."
69899,"It's just further and further down the math rabbit hole...

^(edit: grammar)"
69900,I went through months of lectures without seeing a real-world example or practical application of what I was supposed to be studying. All theoretical stuff.
69901,"If you intend to do anything graphics related, linear algebra."
69902,"I myself am no longer a computer science major, wasn't what I wanted out of life, but my roommate still is and, at our university at least, it is required that all computer science majors must also complete a minor in math. So he is looking at taking 7+ math classes."
69903,"More homework than anyone else.  
At work/internship: ""Hey here is this code project thing, take 3-6 months idgaf I don't know shit about CS""  
At school: ""Recreate Siri but better. Uhhh...due tomorrow I guess"""
69904,"Funny, at my school all the engineering majors hated the CS majors for our lack of homework. While they would have problem sets every week, we had a project due every few weeks. Which meant a lot of time doing nothing, then a few nights locked in the lab to get the code compiled & submitted by 11:59:59"
69905,"> Which meant a lot of time doing nothing, then a few nights locked in the lab to get the code compiled & submitted by 11:59:59

This is the most apt description of a CS student's life I've ever read, especially the part about submitting by 11:59:59."
69906,"Comp-sci instructor. Can confirm. If the assignment is due on Friday, 90% of the questions/problems are e-mailed to me on Friday."
69907,And the rest is handed in on Saturday.
69908,"I figured it was almost the other way around, due to bosses and managers knowing jackshit about the work that goes into programming."
69909,"No, that happens when you become the middle manager and can bullshit upper management enough to give you more time than you need. Which is quite rare."
69910,"I don't think this is necessarily true. I'm in computer science and my brother is in engineering, he gets more homework than me."
69911,"Exam question: ""Make a O(n) sorting algorithm that works on a list with an unknown range of elements"" THAT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SOLVE THE P/NP PROBLEM ON A 50 MINUTE EXAM YOU DICKHOLE"
69912,Create an algorithm and then state that it must run on a non-deterministic turing machine.
69914,"Just do Drop Sort.

Drop Sort is an algorithm that will *always* return a sorted list in O(n). 

Drop sort is just start on the second element of the list. If the element is smaller than the previous element, drop it from the list, else move to the next element. Repeat for the entire list. You will always take n-1 operations worst case, the list will always be sorted. It is a lossy algorithm, just like Jpeg."
69915,"Just use Miracle Sort.

Randomly shuffle the list once. There is a non-zero probability that it is now sorted. Close enough."
69916,Great job market.
69917,Linguistics :)
69918,"Now linguistics is just fun. Learning it all can be a bit trippy as you spend the first few classes copying your lecturer to make individual phonemes (imagine a whole class of people going oooooo and then being corrected for it not being oooo-y enough). It's also incredibly interesting - or it was for me!

However, it does depend on what part of linguistics you're going to focus on. The phonetics? The socio-linguisitcs (why languages change etc)? I did linguistics coupled with a French degree but my sister did pure linguistics and we both turned out to end up learning a broad range of different things.

I have little idea for how the job market looks for linguistics, but if you're really into it, I'd recommend staying in academia for a while and really specialising in it.

Start learning your IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) now as that shit is vital and you'll use it all the time in literally everything you do. Forgetting what the symbol is for A in cat as opposed to A in car is where you come unstuck. Unless you're from Boston I guess."
69919,"Sociolinguistics is not so much why language changes as it is how language impacts society and how society impacts language.

Job wise, there are some linguistics jobs with the government, some with search engines (Google keeps a few), some forensic linguistics jobs (decoding a recording that will be used as evidence in a criminal case), and a few codebreaking things. Not a whole lot, but there are options not in academia."
69920,"No one else is mentioning computational linguistics, which is where all them jobs at right now. If you have more questions, visit us at /r/linguistics!"
69921,"First of all, make sure you know what linguistics is first. It's not just learning a lot of languages and it's not learning prescriptive grammar/ style rules. Those are the two biggest misconceptions I see. 

Second, I would advise either double majoring or minoring in math/ statistics or computer science. A good deal of linguistics research looks at statistical models of language, and both statistics and programming will help you deal with your language data. In addition, Computational linguistics (my field) is pretty sexy right now and it's great if you love problem solving. It's also nice if you love linguistics but also like having money and eating not-ramen."
69922,"Journalism. Part-time job here I come.

Edit: Thanks so much for the comments. I haven't been able to reply because of school but you all helped me realize the amount of work I'm going to need to put in, in order to be successful in this field.

Edit 2: Well you guys have officially made me scared with this major."
69923,"You won't necessarily have to get a part time job, but majoring in journalism is all about internships and experience. Start writing for your college paper right out of the gate and grab as many internships as you can (without spreading yourself too thin). Yeah, the job market is extremely tough, but there are still full-time jobs out there. They just don't pay as well as those engineering jobs. It's certainly possible to make it in a field that I'm not quite sure is as dead as everyone says it is."
69924,"Theatre major here. Just remember, technicians work in theaters, actors work in cafes."
69925,It's easier to get a job pointing the spotlight than standing in it.
69926,"The only hard thing about standing in the spotlight comes from every actors inability *to fucking find it.* 
(Tech rehearsals definitely don't make me salty)"
69927,"What I'd always shout at actors who can't find their light:

""Are you comfortable? Can you see the audience? THEN YOU'RE STANDING IN THE DARK."""
69928,You guys are definitely directors/visual directors. I hear this all the time.
69929,"If you're hearing it that often, you should probably stop standing in the dark."
69930,"Actor here and . . . yeah, he is pretty much right. My wife (also an acting major) runs a theatre education program for kids, and I travel around giving presentations to high schoolers, so we are both *kind of* in our field, but we're the lucky ones. Dozens of the other actors from my program went to New York and LA, some of them *very* talented, hard-working, attractive, everything you could hope for. None of them are making a living acting, not a single one, and most of them are working in the service industry.

*However*, I am convinced that Acting is perhaps the single best major for learning people skills. Nobody really hires exclusively for that, they want an expert in one area who also happens to already be a people person, but perhaps a double major would work out well?"
69931,"Back in my senior year of CS they finally dropped the requirement for ""personal and professional development"". As the dept shared a building with the theater dept, there was talk of replacing that requirement with an improv class option instead."
69932,"CS majors forced to take a theater/drama class?  That would be worth the tuition to watch.

Edit:Yes I know not all CS majors are socially awkward introverts, but a lot of people I meet, I'm in the industry, are ULTRA introverts who would like nothing better than to be left alone and not have any personal contact, at all."
69933,"Yes! Do technical focus, you can still take the acting classes and perform in school productions to build up experience and network with local companies."
69934,"Be ready for long hours and lots of stress. A lot of people just look at the glitz and the glamor. They don't take into account getting on set at 6 AM to load in. Or 12 hour days, 6 days a week to film a series, for a month or more at a time. If you're ready for this, be prepared to jump from job to job because a show/film isn't done for years at a time like most jobs."
69935,Stage management major here. Every graduating stage manager in my program is already going into a kickass job. All of the graduating actors..... eh...
69936,Engineering. Absolutely no idea which type though
