Run The Jewels 2- Run The Jewels

Obviously these are not the only albums are consider to be the best albums of all time but Kendrick Lamar is the new king of west coast hip hop and he sure as hell deserves it and Run The Jewels is making incredible music and helping grow and expand experimental hip hop as it just begins to emerge.

Also, /r/hiphopheads has their essential album of the week posts if you are trying to get an ""official"" opinion on the matter."

52794,"I am a huge Aesop Rock fan! :)

Glad to see that there are still some real hip-hop heads out there. I thought this mumble trash had destroyed everyone's minds. Lol"
52795,Some butthurt mumble rap fan down voting my comment. Sorry that your music taste is trash. Maybe get off the xans.
52796,"Honestly it's just different. Like the pinnacle of pop music is often not exceptional. Lil Pump isn't winning any pulitzers any time soon, but I've come to appreciate what some of the new kids are bringing to the table, even if I don't personally like all of it.

I think a lot of the current production sensibilities sound bad, but that's just because of what I grew up with and my personal tastes. Apparently this is a documedocument noted psychology we all suffer from."
52797,"Just different? Fine, I'll accept that, BUT don't call it hip hop. It is NOT hip hop. It is an entirely new genre. They can't even rap. There is no substance to their lyrics, and they obly talk about drugs, sex, money, designer clothes, and cars that cost more than a house. They all use the same old tired triplet rhythm. I grew up in the 90s when rapping about your material wealth became a thing, but the main difference is: they could actually rap, AND they had the decency to call it rap instead of hip hop. They knew it was a new genre altogether."
52798,"I see what you mean. I guess it's just labels at the end of the day. I've heard Post Malone be called rap, but he clearly isn't. I mean it's not like there weren't plenty of rappers glorifying all the same shit. There's still concious rap and contentless rap just like there always was.

If I were to choose one of the newer kids and say ok I can kinda see what's going on here and kinda like some of it is Ski Mask the Slump God. At first I was like what the fuck is this trash and eventually I was repping him to people. Creative, fun loving, and really wacky off the wall.

The new movement is more akin to the mentality of party punk rock I find rather than political or social statements. But there's also still plenty of great stuff happening in between. JID is the example that really jumps to mind. I also really like some of cupcaKke's stuff."
52799,I haven't heard too many new artists just because I am not a big fan of what i have heard. I do however think Joyner Lucas is dope. So is Tory Lanes. And i was pleasantly surprised by xxxtenation's album.

(this is more albums ive listened to the most to outside of illmatic, tpab and the eminem show, the reason i dont listen to illmatic that often because for some reason im just never in the mood to listen to 90s boom bap and for the other two its because they are very long projects that dont have much replay value even though they are amazing albums in isolated listens.

those are the ones that came off the top of my head, probably a couple im forgetting - kinda not sure if i want to include tpab because its an album that has practically no replay value but if you havent listened to it in a while it will be fucking fantastic so idk. also some other albums i thought of but wasnt sure to put on or not: jpegmafia - veteran, denzel curry - ta13oo (both for the same reason in that they were just released - granted i didnt even really seriously put together a top 10 of all time either so including them would probably be fine but i just didnt feel right including such new projects) kanye west 808s and heartbreak (at first i wanted to include it cause its tied with mbdtf for being my favorite kanye album, but considering that 808s is hardly even a rap album it would of felt weird putting it on the list. namely because i feel like if im putting that on the list then why not just throw a weeknd album or frank ocean which are two artists i love but arent really rap artists)"

Couldnt put his mixtapes because OP said albums. TBH it feels wrong to try and compare any of his albums. Theyre all great in their own right. But to me this is his most aesthetically pleasing album. I did cry during 4YEO, the song, so dont get me wrong I love that one too :)"
52882,Yeah no doubt. I love what he did with modern production sensibilities on KOD and kind of made them his own in a lot of ways. It's a big departure from his more typical sound and the flows show cased he has way more range than hes shown. Really well executed concept album. I'm just a sucker for  those strings and horns and all the singing/harmonies. Beautiful

I hate College Dropout because of the horrific mixing, monotonous production, and Kanye kinda being a trash can quality rapper at the time but I thought he stepped it up a ton on this.  Beats had variety and his raps got way better.  Him rapping wasn't the worst aspect of the songs anymore.

I don't really like a lot of albums like that.  I can name 10 albums I like but ""Top 10""... like I can't put a CD with 14 songs, 8 are doo doo or I always skip them when they come up.

50447,"When the original post speaks of RATM's production, it refers to the way the album was mixed and mastered. In hip hop, when people talk about production, they're usually referring to the beats and the instrumental aspects of an album. The mixing and mastering are both different things.

So all the people in this thread answering with MBDTF might be right it's the best produced hip hop album due to its great beats and instrumentation, but that doesn't mean it's well-produced in the same sense as RATM's debut. I know a lot of people criticize MBDTF for having been mixed sort of messily."
50448,Yeah I saw that. Maybe I should have explained it differently
50449,Dr. Dre - 2001
50450,"Honestly, I think there's no competition, Dre's magnum opus is one of the best produced albums period (imo). Some will say ""the chronic"" is his best, but I think  2001 is a near perfect album for what it was trying to do.

Dre is a fucking magician."
50451,Doggystyle > Chronic though imo. But yes 2001 is GOAT production

50486,"Replying to your comment so you can see.  So today I listened to The Chronic and 2001 both for the first time, and I've gotta say I don't know what I was waiting for.  On the first listen, I thought both were good, not great (but I mean, both have alot of tracks and one listen is never enough to fully absorb all an album has to offer).  So I definitely will have both on repeat in the near future.  First impressions is I think I liked more songs and the lyrics better on The Chronic, but 2001 deserves every accolade it's gotten for production.  The songs to me lyric wise were a bit more forgettable, but goddamn the production was glorious in my headphones, definitely gonna reply this one to see the tiny details in production, and along the way I'm sure the songs overall will grow on me.  All said and done, I definitely still see Dre's production outshining his raps, but both albums were well worth my money and I'm glad I finally listened to both front to back!"

50491,Same! When this album is farther down than Kid Cudi on terms of production... Y'all opinions is skewed
50492,This needs to be at the top of this thread. This album is not only beautifully produced but the best example of effective sampling in rap ive ever heard.
50493,madvillainy
50494,Mm... Food is another great one
50495,yeah i think all of DOOM's albums have great production(Key to the kuffs is kinda weird tho). madvillainy aint even my favorite DOOM album but the production on that thing stands out.
50496,yea well Madlib
50497,"Every buddy underestimates The Mouse and The Mask. Oh well, I guess Dangermouse's cartoony production isn't for everyone. But I think it's one of DOOM's most energetic, unique, and best albums."
50498,i like it alot too. but it has some fillers that keeps me from going back to it. at the same time it has some of my favorite tracks of all time tho.
50499,"I agree that not every track is a standout, but there are no stinkers on here, and the album is short enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome, like Yeezus."
50500,"i dont think it has any bad tracks either. but tracks like perfect hair. A.T.H.F and no names are kinda boring to me, i just feel like DOOM's voice is extra laid back on some of the songs on the album while he is talking about very uninteresting things.  maybe im not a big enouch cartoon nerd."
50501,I just want to say how much I enjoy every buddy as an alternative to everybody. Much friendlier.
50502,"I loved Key to the Kuffs, much more low fi then alot of DOOM's stuff, I thought JJ did a great job on there."
50503,Agreed. Key to the Kuffs has a few on there that just sound like noise. I tried to get over it but I can't.
50504,Operation: Doomsday is my personal favorite.
50505,my favorite DOOM album too. but i'd say madvillainy is better. i just like doomsday more for some reason. i guess the nonstop fire tracks does it for me or something. or maybe because of how raw it is.
50506,He's work with Danger Mouse was pretty good too. The track Sofa King has a mean violin loop.
50507,yeah the production on that is def dope. but i feel like it has some filler. at the same time it has some of my favorite tracks of all time aswell tho.
50508,"Some of the production on there is a bit of a mess though. Tracks like The Finest or Red and Gold. 

The best tracks (Deadbent, Doomsday, Rhymes Like Dimes) are probably my favourite DOOM tracks of all time but there were some weird production decisions in there as well.

I'd agree that Madvillainy is his best produced project."
50509,"yeah, DOOM didnt really have shit at that point in his life so he probably couldnt mix it properly. that's kind of a reason i like it tho. you can tell that he actually was close to being homeless after his brother died."
50510,The finest and red and gold are two off my favorite DOOM songs
50511,I would argue that Doom has the most consistent production discography in the game.  Even without the colab albums.
50512,ì'd say he has the most consistent discography period.

50526,I believe the guys in r/music read the question wrong too.
50527,"Clipse - Hell Hath No Fury

It's an entirely Neptunes-produced album, which makes it enormously cohesive, and it has this dark, gritty, minimalistic vibe with synths that seem from outer space and bass that will straight rattle your shit. Even though this feels like one single whole with the same building blocks, every song is different and unique. F.e. Ride Around Shining's twisted glistening sound vs. Wamp Wamp's thumping warped bongos . No other album illustrates as clearly what the Neptunes were capable of in their prime, and it was fucking magnificent.

Liberation, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, the title track, Rosa Parks, Gregorian chants on the intro, spoken word, 70s southern funk... entirely epic. It was MBDTF 15 years earlier, with a funky Southern vibe instead."
50555,"I love Aquemini and its production, but I prefer ATLiens. It's just so brilliantly understated, which creates the perfect semi-conscious southern hip-hop vibe throughout the album."
50556,"Doggystyle - Snoop n Dre 

 Edit: personally I think this this production is more creative than the chronics"
50557,That album could be produced tomorrow and still sound amazing.
50558,"I'm surprised no one has said RAP Music by Killer Mike or Cancer 4 Cure by El-P. those are some of El's most polished works.

The thing I love about El-P is that he can change his production to match the style that he goes for. RAP Music was crazy and vibrant and southern. Cancer 4 Cure is more industrial and darker. Both amazing El-Producto works.

And now I see that u/kingmusa has posted both RM and C4C. My opinions still stand."

Some of the arrangements on the songs are very easy to hear and very thing sounds natural and individual.
