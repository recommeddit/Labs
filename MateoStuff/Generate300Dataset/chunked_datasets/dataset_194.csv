63879,"Public Torrent Indexers specialized in audiobooks:

There are also private torrent trackers specialized in that content. You'll want to search through /r/Trackers for more info on those.

Of course Audiobookbay goes up again as soon as I post this. :P"
63881,"Don't worry dude, I've been having no end of issues with getting to that site, + getting to it AND being able to use the mag links... Has a great selection of History and non fiction though.

Sigh... Wish there were more big public ones..."

63885,"The site is definitely up as of this writing. You might try seeing if you can browse to the site via [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) or get a paid torrent friendly VPN (see /r/VPNTorrents) in the case your country or ISP is blocking it.

Otherwise you'll have to try using a general public torrent indexer, or join private torrent trackers for audiobooks (see /r/Trackers). AFAIK there are no other public torrent sites specialized in audiobooks."
63886,It's working now thanks
63888,"Probably want to try one of the other subs for help with that, e.g. /r/audiobooks, /r/applehelp, /r/ITunes, /r/AndroidQuestions, etc."
63889,Demonoid has a decent audiobook section.
63891,There are categories on the site. I always use those and they're what really makes the site shine compared to others as I can actually find new material there.
63893,Comment removed per rules #9 and #1.

63895,Explain how to join.
63896,Put on your tie and get in for an interview
63897,Thanks so much for this! Looking forward to getting in there. I've looked everywhere for this one book with no luck - hoping it's on here. The fact it's so hard to find makes me more anxious/excited to get it lol
63898,you need VIP membership to get newer releases
63899,Yeah you can buy vip with bonus points. Just seed a bunch for a week or so and you can buy a month
63900,Sound fair. How do I get in??

works for me.

It plays in background and i can set playback speed. That is all what i want.

Tip: if you are listening to a audiobook with more than one chaper and have multiple files, make a playlist. It is one time process and free you from navigating file manager each time you want to listen tothe book."
63910,"> Mobilism.me
If you have an iPhone you can load the folder containing the files directly into iTunes which allows some nuance in how you want to sort your titles."

63914,[https://b-ok.xyz/](https://b-ok.xyz/) is my favourite
63915,Awesome! I’ve gotten two new great looking sites from this post so far - I’m super excited to get on there and start seeing what’s available. Thanks!
63916,no worries! thank you for this post
63917,is this site deleted now ?
63918,"Definitely MyAnonamouse. I'll check Mobilism first but if it's not there, MyAnonamouse very rarely lets me down."
63919,"https://ebookbb.com/

https://ikindlebooks.com/"
63920,Those are both brand new to me… I’m looking forward to checking them out! Thanks!
63921,yudhacookbook.my.id for cookbooks
63922,Thanks! Mobilism.me also has a crapload of current cookbooks
63923,Thanks for the rec for mobilism I didn't know about that site and I found a lot of cookbooks on yudhacookbook which I couldn't find on libgen or b-ok.cc
63924,Is there a website for downloading magazines? Especially German magazines?
63925,"I've managed to find some good audiobooks on https://1337x.to/, better than ebookbay actually."
63926,"think libgen deserves a mention here

edit: forgive me, was blind and didn't read the op well"
63927,Is there like a telegram bot ?
63928,Z library have a bot
63929,I know but for audiobook?
63930,"What is it?

Can you share"

63932,"LibGen is far and away the best, better than anything else.

I'm personally fond of Archive.org and VKontakte, because I mostly like obscure out-of-print stuff and children's books - and both sites are great for one-offs that people have scanned and uploaded themselves."
63933,"Protip: If you know a good website and want to know more good websites like it, input the site url in https://www.alexa.com/find-similar-sites and click 'Find'."
63934,You could also enter the site into Spyfu and go into the competititors tab. It'll list all sites that are just like it.
63935,Is this something we can update on the Megathread?
63936,z-lib.org
63937,Shodan for Calibre libraries is the best. You just have to check occasionally to see what the cost is. I was able to get a lifetime membership for $5.00 about a year ago. Look for price specials.
63938,Thanks for the links!
63940,"I did give the links.. just type them in as I listed them. For example, mobilism.me would be www.mobilism.me

The only one that I didn’t provide a link for is the e-book chat on IRCHighway, because that requires downloading an IRC client."
63941,"Links are the standard.

FYI to all: ebooks3000 is non-HTTPS"
63942,So how do we access it?
63944,FBReader
63945,"[Ebookee.com](https://Ebookee.com) always sends me to [bestbooks.site](https://bestbooks.site) or to a phishing google site , every time I try to download an ebook 

How do you use this ?"
63946,"Some of the sites make you wade through a bunch of ads before you’re actually able to download the file… same as sites like zippyshare, etc. You just have to keep hitting the download button until it works, or use something that doesn’t display ads. 

I bought a premium account on mobilism (one-time charge of $20 I think) so I could get direct downloads instead of having to deal with all of the spam… but if you don’t want to do either, your best bet is to use IRC. You just search for the books you want, they send you a results file, and then you cut and paste your selection and then they send it to you direct.

[here’s how](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to use IRC for ebooks. It takes the most time to get set up (15 mins or so) but once you have it configured, it’s the fastest and most reliable way to get books. It only takes me around 45 seconds from opening IRC until I have the new book downloaded.

Oh, I use IRCHighway, not undernet. Pretty much nobody uses undernet anymore, But there are usually a few hundred people on irchighway at any given time plus around a dozen upload servers."
63947,"Not a site, but #rpg-books on irc.dejatoons.net has been my go-to for D&D/RPG books for the last decade."
63949,Question. Once you download an mp3 how are you listening? That looks like odd software/download. Is there a way to get these in your audible account and if not on your phone?
63950,"I use pocketcast. It allows to fast forward, rewind etc easily just like a pod episode."
63951,"Hmm, I use the default audio app on my laptop/phone. I don't have an audible account nor I'm familiar with any of those so I don't know how to answer the second question."
63953,"Wow this is quite comprehensive. So far I've had success with audiobook bay and converting them/opening into VLC which has switched over to the freeaudiobook app.

It sounds like I should stay away from the sites you just went over extensively...ugh"
63954,yes audiobookbay is great but it's a bit lacking in the audible collection. it also relies on user-submitted torrents which are generally okay but a bit hit and miss. with the recent surge in seedboxes eventually it might be as reliable as website hosts
63955,"Ah the message I responded to is now gone :(

I don't even remember the other options.

Audiobook bay is ancient looking at the search function feels horrible. Any better suggestions"
63956,"I felt I divulged a little too much so decided to delete it

abb is over a decade old I believe. there are a few really active members but 99% of their traffic is just non-interacting consumers. I agree the search is in need of a revamp

someone else suggested myAnonamouse, I haven't tried it yet since it's invite only, just waiting until I can make time for the interviews they hold

other than that, abb is the only free, public aggregator specifically for audiobooks"
63957,Ah so you don't really use anything then
63958,not sure how you came to that conclusion
63959,"I guess I just assumed sorry.

What's your preference"
63960,It doesn't appear to be working anymore. Did they update their site?
63961,"audiobookx and audiobookcup probably detected it again. I've made a request to 123Sudo, the creator of 9xbuddy, to fix the extraction on those websites. I noticed that he usually updates every 2 days. Maybe he'll update 9xbuddy on the 29th."
63962,Awesome! I appreciate it :)
63963,Any idea when this will be updated. I just found out about this and am really trying to get a book I'm looking for
63964,Welp no sign of it being included on the next 9xbuddy update. Can you send me DM about the book you're looking for? thanks.
63966,"9xbuddy's the only extractor that I know of. Sometimes I just do a google search on the audiobook that I want. Check out r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH, too!"
63967,Thanks for this. Really useful.
63968,"Woah, thanks I really like how this is a direct download"
63969,Thank you so much brother!
63970,No problem. Glad that it helped!
63971,if i had money to blow i'd give you gold
63972,"Legend, thanks for this. Couldn't find what I wanted anywhere, wasn't on MyAnonamouse"
63973,"Ultra late reply, but audiobookcup.com appears to be working with 9xbuddy again. Audiobookx is still busted, though."
63974,"Hey thanks for the update! 😄

Edit: Tried it myself but it's still giving me an error."
63975,"MyAnonamouse. It's semi-private as in you can't just sign up but it's not difficult to get in. On certain days of the week they do a thing in IRC where you read the rules, they ask you a couple questions to make sure you read them, then invite you to join. The only time I ever don't find what I'm looking for there is if it's super obscure."
63976,"We are anomalous.

63978,Its not working for me either. I'm running PIA VPN
63979,ever get it working with PIA?
63980,"I endded up back myanonamouse, which I respect very much, but which also requires me to have a seedbox in order to run it through my VPN. I believe there are ways to use their site with a VPN without a seedbox but I was unable to master it with my level of know-how/patience."
63981,That site turns up blank?
63982,"Working perfectly fine for me, ISP might be blocking it, you get a cloudflare error code?"
63983,"No nothing.. just blank. 
Using firefox and chrome on phone.
Vpn on the Netherlands, germany, ulusa and uk."
63984,same here - those countries are blocking it. I've had good luck so far with connecting via Sweden and France (the non-censoring countries :)
63985,try to change dns
63986,They want your phone and credit card.
63987,"myanonymouse, SUPER friendly super nice super cool"
63988,AudiobookBay and MyanonaMouse
63989,"I went there, and it requires me to sign up with supreme blaze, which costs a ton of money. Am I doing anything wrong?"
63990,i guess direct download is not free while the torrent is
63991,Myanonemouse
63992,have you heard of audiobook bay site it is only for audiobooks
63993,Definitely exists.  You can find at least the vast majority of audiobooks (not volunteer).
63994,audiobookbay(dot)nl - found all books i ever searched for
63995,I can often find the books but a huge number of them aren't being seeded.
63996,"Thanks, this worked for me, you don't even need to email activate the account."
63997,"> (dot)

Why do people do this? I can understand not hyperlinking it when you type it from memory but why make it so that people on desktop can't just select the typed URL and drag it to open it in a new tab?

http://audiobookbay.nl/"
63998,"Guessing Safety Rules, To prevent it from getting wiped again for sharing piracy stuff"
63999,You talking about Rule 3? You can share top level links to general requests.
64000,"idk if its allowed to post links, sorry it took you 3 seconds to add the dot"
64001,You’re looking for MyAnonamouse. Interviews are every Wednesday and Saturday over IRC
64002,*squeak*
64003,"You can find some, but it's really hit or miss depending on what you're looking for. I ended up buying access to someone's scribd account on eBay. $5 for 2 years of access."
64004,You bought a stolen accout. Just saying
64005,"No, the guy can clearly see that I use the account for audiobook downloads, while he uses it for finance and business books. If it really was a stolen account, they would have booted me months ago. Every time you open the app it shows recent usage, there's no way to hide it."
64006,"Dosent change shit, I the user had A credit card connected a user could easily change the email and thus sit with a account he can sell to multiple people"
64007,Audiobookbay.nl is a great site.
64008,Newbie here.  It requires payment.  Is that right?
64009,No just register and download the magnet links. It will open your BitTorrent client.
64010,Keep on digging
64011,There is a private tracker where you can get far more ebooks and audiobooks than what.cd ever had. I would be killed if I mentioned the name.
64012,Wasn't WCD mainly a music tracker?
64013,"Music, eBooks, Audiobooks, Comics and Applications."
64014,now you're asking the good questions. i found a website a year ago. i managed to ear all 6 book of a song of ice and fire.  It's in portuguese so it won't be much help for you guys. Try searching by the book name
64015,You got my attention 🤗please send me site address 😉 i'm portuguese
64016,Bookaudiobook.com
64017,"of course audiobook piracy exists...the fuq?  Keep digging you ignoramous.

Also type in your favorite somewhat popular author into youtube and just about all of his/her audiobooks should be there for you to download or listen to."
64018,Try mobilism.
64019,Cant thank you enough. I am struggling with my financial situation right now and am adamant at upping my game learning everything about the business that i am in. I am from a developing country and and the help i get from places like these and contributors like you can't go unappreciated. Thanks a lot man. God bless technology.
64020,No problem :)
64021,"Libraries typically have access audiobooks at no charge. Worth looking into and super easy. And if you want to keep them, there are methods to make sure you can be DRM free :)"
64022,I have never gotten an audiobook I wanted from the Overdrive system my library uses. They're always on hold or not available.
64023,MAM?
64024,You need an invite and the whole process seems a bit complicated when I just want to download an audiobook every now and then. Not really a power user
64025,"Don’t need an invite, just need to apply and answer some questions regarding rules. But your call :)"
64026,"[Actually you do need an invite. ](https://www.myanonamouse.net/inviteapp.php)

>Unfortunately, if you are reading this, MyAnonamouse has become a victim of its own success. We have so many fantastic members, that we have had to close our doors to everyone without an invite.

You currently have to go through their IRC server during specific 25 hour time slots only on Wednesday or Saturday to get an invite."
64027,"Well, that’s the interview process. You are correct that you have to do this process, but it’s not an invite per se from another user. You just hop on, que up, read rules, answer questions etc."
64028,Mobilism. Or sign up for Audible free trial... Download the audiobook of your choice and strip DRM with InAudible. Audible allow you to return any audiobook no questions asked so it's just rinse and repeat.
64029,Where can I download mobilism? Mobilism.online seems sketchy
64030,Try .org
64031,Mobilism is by far your best bet IMO.  They also offer a 10 day premium trial which I highly recommend.  Id say you'll be able to find 90% of the books you're looking for on there.  Takes a few minutes to get used to the site but after that you're laughing!!
64032,"audiobookbay served me well, actual i try random yandex/bing/google searched with title m4b or mp3 added to it and quality of wanted hosting service, sometimes turns something up."
64033,"DC++ is where you want to be.

BUT OMG CHECK THIS https://www.audiobookx.com/

This site goes free to download very rarely and it just so happens that today it is free.  To download from them, right click and inspect element on a web page then copy the link for whatever book you want and paste it to the page, then download it like that.

but ya, pm later about DC++, DC++ is where you want to go for audiobooks, it's a place called dawghouse where people with terabytes of audiobooks all share with each other.

DC++ is 10x better than audiobookbay...and if you want to pay for audiobookx, i think it's a subscription based thing you can do that...or you can wait till it's free and download everything they have like I do hahaha."
64034,"I would love some info on the hub on dc++ :) :) 

&#x200B;"
64035,"remind me in a few days.  This site goes free once in a blue moon so I'm downloading everything that they have uploaded since the last time lol.

But ya, DC++ is a file sharing program where there's things called HUBS and people meet in these hubs and share files with each other.  It just so happens that DC++ is the best place to get comics and audiobooks on the internet BY FAR.

The only issue is people I've tried to get to sign up for it say they can't get into the chat room to register.

If you want to get started asap on this, this is what I would do.  You want to download DC++ and look up the hub called ""perfection"".  Find the address and enter it into dc++ and go to that chat room.  First register for that comic hub.

After you have registered, message a guy named UKPete and ask him if you can register to dawghouse.mine.nu so you can start downloading audiobooks (assuming you can't get in normally which you might not be able to).

And be super nice to a guy named nestlesux as he has a huge stick up his ass and is the one who will register you.

You don't have to answer questions or anything it's easy to register.  There's like 5 or so comic book rooms you can go into and ask people there why you can't get into dawghouse.mine.nu to download audiobooks.

But ya, you should go to audiobookx right now and download, their entire catalog is free right now which rarely happens.

to download though open a page and right click and do inspect element.  Then go to the bottom of the page and click on network, then click media and other.  Then leave that page alone, go to the site and find whatever book you want.  Each book you want, paste it to the inspect element page.  

You'll then see a media file pop up at the bottom, right click that and hit open in another tab.  Then your book will start playing and you can just right click on the page and download it.

But ya, hit me up in a few days and I can help you further, I'm typing super fast right now so I can get back to downloading lol."
64037,you should have been redirected to a waiting room where you register.
64038,nope. pw protection right away
64039,"This is great! Back in the day DC++ used to be mainly a Linux thing and it was a huge issue getting it running natively on Windows due to some libraries that were free in Linux buy prohibitively expensive on Windows. 

I gave up on it when I got out of IT and lost interest in Linux. Pretty happy to see it's now convenient for Windows. I didn't know that it was!"
64040,"ya it's super legit...there might be hubs that are good for new movies/tv/music but I don't know of them...that being said, even in audiobook/comic hubs, the people there are pirates and have like 30 terabyte shares, so they usually have the newest movies/tv/music anyway.

But for audiobooks and comics dc++ is where it's at."
64041,any advice on hubs for audiobooks?
64042,Did you ever find a good audiobook hub?
64043,nope
64044,Thanks alot! I've started to download some Stephen King of that website now:) but I can't find the adresse for the hub Perfection. Any idea where I can find it?
64045,"if you google ""comic hub pefection"" it's right there.

perfection.comichub.org:777"
64046,"> perfection.comichub.org:777

Thank you :)"
64047,"Quick question, as it does say its free. But when downloading it prompts for a 4.99 payment on each|? Any ideas/guidance would be hugely appreciated"
64048,"you have to get a download plugin or you have to do this.

On your browser you hit the right mouse button and click inspect element.  Then you'll see stuff at the bottom of the page.

I use firefox, so when I do this I see ""Network"" at the bottom of the page.  Click on that and then click on Media and Other.

Now what you do is you open a new page with the audiobookx site.  You find whatever book you want, then you copy the link and then paste it to the inspect element page.

When doing this you then will see 1 link pop up at the bottom of the page with GET next to it.  Right click on that or double click it to open it or right click it and click OPEN IN ANOTHER TAB.

Then your book will start playing...then just right click on that page where the audiobook is playing and click download."
64049,Does this still work? I can't get it to work for me.
64050,"well the site isn't free atm...you have to check it daily to see when it's free.  Then when it's free, you spend a few hours downloading everything that you need until you're caught up as they are a relatively new site with not many books.

So you want to ge tinto a pattern as when they go free, you snag books you can't find anywhere else.

And I don't know if the site will ever go free again...but if you judge by the past, they will and quite often."
64051,"Works, you my friend are amazing!"
64052,hell jeaaaaa
64053,"I'd say on average twice a month the site goes free.  To download though you have to either get a plug in or right click on a page and click inspect element.  That's the only way to download the media/audio from the page.

If you are confused, download a plug in that searched a page for audio/video and downloads it for you.  Also you have to play the book, press play first, then it will come up for you to download."
64054,"Thanks. Came across this thread through a google search and coincidentally enough, it's currently ""free"" right now and they have some audiobooks I've been looking for."
64055,"aye, it seems every sunday they go free these days.  Something funny though...I don't know if they are doing it just to me, but I tried downloading books yesterday and it was ultra slow and the downloads failed.

I think on free days...well they either know my ip and are slowing my downloads down on free days, or they are starting to slow down downloads on free days.  Were you downloads super slow?

If you didn't know how to download, you have to inspect element or download a video download plugin.  What I do is I right click the mouse, scroll to inspect element, click it, then press play on the book.  Then the media file will pop up at the bottom if you click media and other, then you right click that and open it in another page.

But ya, assuming you already knew that were your download speeds super slow?"
64056,"No not too bad.  
I did at one point seem very slow speeds (like 200KB/s), but often times I was getting 2-3MB/s.  
One book got upwards of 10MB/s but that seemed to be a fluke."
64057,"wow no shit...weird.  They prob just flagged my IP then cause every time they are free I download stuff and I've been doing it since they opened the site.

But ya, I check every day to see when they are free, but as of late every Sunday they are free, so I'd bank on that day."
64058,"Thanks for the info. 

I managed to grab about 8-10 audiobooks but had to get some elsewhere as this site didn't seem to have everything I was looking for.  
Weirdly they had some books from a certain series but not all."
64059,"ya it's a weird site for sure.  The site started like 6 months ago I'd say and they just started adding like 30 books a day.  

Some days they add nothing especially when it's free.

What's crazy though is the search function is shit on the site so they might have had the books you wanted but you just couldn't search for them...but they for sure don't have a shit ton of stuff.

But if you want to search for a book, you have to search by author and you have to spell it how they spell it exactly or the search will fail.  

They will for instance spell the authors name a certain way for 3 books then a different way for another book so you won't be able to find it.

Thankfully though since I've known about the site since it started, I just go through everything...so I keep track of what book was lasted added so I know where I'm at...at first I downloaded 100's of books, but now it's only like 5-10 every time the site goes free.

But ya, if they ip flag you like they did to me, just save the download link to the books and download them the next few days when it's not free anymore and the links will still work....that is until they decide to clamp down on that.

Anywho"
64060,Someone's going to rip that whole site with a script today I bet.
64061,No idea how they get away with charging memberships for their site..but it's been up and running like this for quite a while and they go free like once every couple months and it usually lasts 3-5 days.
64062,"lol the mods I guess don't understand audiobooks...they hid this post.  Every time I post this site here for people to download the mods are like DERRRRRRRRRRRRP IT'S A PAY SITEEEEEE DERPPPPPPP YOU MIGHT BE ADVERTISING DERPPPPPPPPPPP.

Fucken a people are dumb.  It's essentially like audible being free and they have a lot of stuff that audiobookbay won't have."
64063,"Thanks for this! =D

I hope i'm doing it right...

So I went to the media tab in inspect element on google chrome in  saw .mp3 file so this is the file I open in a new tab? But before the .mp3 it has something like *filename*Ep5.mp3

The ep5 in the file name makes me think it means episode 5. It shows this ep5 on the file name on every audiobook i look at....

I just want be sure this is the correct thing to download"
64064,"ya that's fine...no idea why they title their books that way but it's legit...I mean I'm sure you downloaded some books 20 hours long by now that say ep 5 lol.

But ya it's legit dude."
64065,I've had a lot of luck with requesting books in the audiobook bay forum. Multiple requests filled. Or overdrive.
64066,"Cool, didn't know about the forum. Have you all requests been answered? Also how long did it take for them to add the book you requested?"
64067,"I'd say it usually takes about a week. Not all of my requests have been fulfilled, but most have."
64068,I recommend you to request on forum.snahp it. I look forward to completing your request.
64069,There are a lot of groups on Facebook that give audible books away for free.  Narrators and authors get 100 codes to give out for promotion.  I'm a narrator so I speak from experience.
64070,Audiobookbay?
64071,Are there any inaudible audiobooks?
64072,Never heard any.
64073,Op did
64074,Are there any ebooks using white fonts on white pages?
64075,Haha nailed it
64266,"[http://audiobookbay.nl/](http://audiobookbay.nl/)  You'll need to make a FREE account (no credit info). I've been using it for 6 months with no problems. 

You'll need 2 apps (that are FREE). I listen to all my books on my phone 

Smart AudioBook Player and uTorrent (I got them from the Android Play store.)

As long as someone is seeding the book you want, it will download.  The uTorrent will tell you the amount of seeders.

Hope this helps!

&#x200B;"
64267,Go to Amazon and search for Free Audiobooks. You'll see a whole list. :)
64268,aside from amazon can you suggest other site where I can download audiobook as much as possible mp3 format
64269,"https://bookriot.com/2016/09/15/11-websites-find-free-audiobooks-online/

try this."
64270,"I think there is a site called LibreVox or something like that.   Free audiobooks read by amateurs, so the quality is unpredictable."
64271,"You check Amazon, also check Google Play for apps that you can download audio books."
64272,My library system allows you to download certain titles (for free) if you have an account.  You may want to check out how it works where you live.
64273,The app is called Overdrive (for all of the library systems I've had)...so worth it!
64274,This!  I have downloaded tons of books from my library.  For free!
64275,"Yup, this is the only way I get audiobooks these days."
64276,Definitely agree.  My local library has a pretty great selection of downloads available.
64277,Audible.com subscription is pretty great.
64278,"My only concern is the closed DRM system. The android app works for me, but I'll only use them if the want the audibook NOW (and don't care too much about loosing access to it since I'll only listen once, probably.)

I actually buy CDs and rip. Some audibooks come as CD-ROMs with mp3 files, which is also nice."
64279,"If you're referring to Audible's DRM there are two facts you should consider:

* The Audible DRM was broken years ago.

* Audible permits creating CDs of the audiobooks.

I understand the desire to hold on to certain audiobooks because you may want to listen to them again. Good news: Audible never deletes purchased audiobboks from your library so you can always re download."
64280,"* The Audible DRM was broken years ago.

didn't know that

* Audible permits creating CDs of the audiobooks.

requires Windows, a blank CD and a CD burner"
64281,"> a *pile of* blank CD*s*

:)"
64282,"Your words, not mine: ***""I actually buy CDs and rip""***

My perspective was simply that Audible allows creating CDs from their Audiobbooks.  What I didn't say was CDs are an anachronism today. I would posit that 85-90% of audiobook listeners prefer digital devices. As to requiring Windows, well perhaps - but even if true, that's 85% of all the computers in the world. Additionally, I'm not aware of PCs sold after 2005 that don't include CD burners. Most today will also bake standard DVDs and I speculate some can cook up Blu-Ray discs.

As *sblinn* observed ""a pile of CDs"". Only true if your opt for conventional audio compact platters.  A minor bit of effort will generate MP3 CDs for those who desire to carry discs but virtually no effort if you prefer to place the MP3s on an iPod or other non Apple digital player."
64283,"Definitely -- Downpour.com offers a very similar service, complete with smartphone apps, etc. and is DRM free."
64284,Agreed. They have an amazing return policy. I've returned several books and gotten prompt refunds with no questions asked.
64285,"This is basically the only site I have found that is reliable. My only issue with audible is that once your account is gone, so are the books.  If OP wants to keep his/her audiobooks, you will have to convert them/save them to harddrive. 

If you cannot find it on audible, I would suggest going to theaudiobookbay. Its not legit, but its the only other place I know to get the rare audiobooks. 

Edit: If you are looking for classics, there are a lot of free audiobook sites with amateur readers. (As long as the copyright has expired)"
64286,"> once your account is gone, so are the books.

This isn't true. I have many Audible books from an account I cancelled years ago that still play just fine.  As long as you keep your computer authorized, they'll still play, and transfer to my iPod without problems."
64287,Really. I did not know this.
64288,"Not only that, but I can use the old username and password to log in to Audible and re-download any books i had purchased in the past. Great for when my iPod died."
64289,"This is 2 weeks later, but I just wanted to also comment on keeping your books.  I had an account from when Audible was brand new... like 1999 or 2000.. any ways I only had an account for about a year. I have not reactivated it since.  

I still listen to books from that account to this day. over 10 years since I canceled it."
64290,good to know
64291,librovox has public domain works on it.
64292,I have listened to many a book from librivox. Great community.
64293,and good readers

64295,Between librivox for audiobooks and  Gutenberg project for ebooks I am getting all my classics of my too read list.
64296,"from my orginal r/audiobook post - http://www.reddit.com/r/audiobooks/comments/10u5zy/hey_audiobooks_subreddit_here_is_all_my_audiobook/  
  
I love audiobooks, keeps me sane on my commute to work/home/long solo drives.

I though i would share my audio book knowledge

* signup at local library, get access to their physical audio books (and access to basically the whole states audio book library) as well as cool audiobook download services. ALL FREE

* librivox.org/ and booksshouldbefree.com/ have free public domain audiobooks

* iphone app - audiobooks by spreadsong Inc - has access to thousands of free public domain audio books that STREAM

* turn an mp3 file into an audiobook so itunes/iphone/ipod see it as an audiobook (so you know the audiobook mp3 doesn't mix with your actual music) 

 -add file to itunes library

 -right click it, ""get info"" , OPTIONS tab, change media kind to audiobook

 -it should disappear from your ""music"" area and now be in your books area

* Chapter and Verse will turn a 100-file mp3-cd into one m4b file. lodensoftware.com/chapter-and-verse/

 -this is not the same as combing 100 mp3 files into 1 mp3 file and setting the huge mp3 as an audiobook. that will in fact choke your ipod/iphone when it tries to load the humongous mp3

* obviously audible.com is the mother load of paid audiobooks.  i have used this ""2 free audiobooks"" offer from audbile ......like 4 times now http://www.audible.com/t1/amazon?source_code=AMZDG901LWS101910

 -from that link make an account it will need a credit card attached 

 -""purchase"" your bookS (for free)

 -now cancel the account

 -you will still forever have access to the books, re-download whenever 

 -Do it again with a new email account. It may not work with the same credit card , but it might. your debit card should work too. 

* iTunes has some audiobooks for when you get itunes gift cards.

* DRM Free options

 -http://store.crossroadpress.com

* Torrents - **BUT DON'T STEAL AUDIOBOOKS** 

* The Library of congress has a special section of audiobooks for disabled people. Dyslexia, blind, etc.. Its all free but you have to be disabled to be eligible and you'll have to prove it. http://www.loc.gov/nls/index.html
They have many many many audiobooks you simply cannot buy.

* **special shout out to ""a clockwork orange"", even though i only gave it 4 stars. it stood out as particularly good audiobook. since the language in that book is so weird, having a good British reader really made it a special experience that you just wouldn't get reading it yourself.**"
64297,"I' a big fan of proper literature so I've listened to a lot of free ones from http://librivox.org/ which i've really enjoyed, and i've listened to the first chapter of a few and decided they're not for me (bad voice / accent)"
64298,"""Booktitle"" and ""audio book"" in Google almost always provides. Unless you live in Sweden like me, where many titles are regionally blocked, hence I end up at the audiobookbay."
64299,"emusic.com has a pretty decent subscription service, too -- and you download the books (quick and easy) so they are yours."
64300,Go to the library. Check out audiobook cds. Rip CD to Zune. Delete the chapters you've listened to as you go.
64301,"audible or torrents, there are a lot of free public domain book out there."
64302,"When I hear of an audiobook I'm interested in, first I:

1. check my library to see if they have it, both physical and in their OverDrive digital catalog
2. if they don't, I (generally with futility) ask that they order it
3. failing that, request a review copy from the publisher
4. failing that, depending on the publisher they may sell the download directly (Tantor, Iambik, Crossroad Press, some others do)
5. failing that, check Downpour
6. failing that, check Audible
7. failing that, check used CD set listings and indeed do the ship, rip, load dance"
64303,arr me matey.
64304,MAM.
64305,What's that?
64306,An ebook/audiobook tracker.
64307,As someone who isn't very knowledgeable in such things (I mostly just go on some mainstream sites to search fir my torrents) could you enlighten me? I'd be interested on the chance it had the series im looking for
64308,Myanonamouse
64309,This seems to be invite only. Is it as simple as DMing someone a link to sign up?
64310,"They have open signups regularly, haven't checked in awhile though"
64311,"I just spent a while looking for some Graphic Audio titles, and I actually successfully found them on forum(dot)snahp(dot)it! Plus it's a DDL site, which I prefer over torrents."
64313,"Well, I have specifically mentioned in the OP that I am aware of the site. But I guess I can look again?

:P"
64315,Np. Will check those out. Hope they have lots of audiobooks. Those aren't always easy to find :(
64317,Allright will try them. If you find/know any other sites that have audiobooks (especially from graphic audio) let me know!
64318,Spotify has audiobooks actually.
64319,The eye
64320,"I used to get a copy of my audiobooks here [Think and Grow Rich Audiobook](https://www.wiaudiobooks.com/product/think-and-grow-rich-audiobook/) , this may not be about what you are looking for but this may be a good source for you where you can start."
64321,"I know you're looking for something specific, but Libby (an app that let's you browse/borrow audiobooks through your local library's catalog) is actually pretty impressive for the value it offers.

Forgive me for sounding like a paid spokesperson, but I'm actually just a pleasantly surprised consumer.

I know, I know -- it's not perfect. Some hot new titles have incredibly long waiting lists, and I guess if your library sucks then this will too since they're one in the same. 

But I've found it's extremely useful for getting my hands on an audiobook that isn't in extremely high demand right this second (World War Z, The Stand, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, etc).

For that, I think it's worth mentioning if you didn't know of its existence already. I didn't until very recently."
64323,"Totally understand. The wait for something as popular as the ""Red Rising"" audiobook at my library is just over 20 weeks."
64325,"Thanks, I had no luck with Inmac or Brokenstones, any tips on how to get an invite for those?"
64326,"There are several sites. I'm using ""mac-torrents"". Just make sure you don't click the big blue ""download"" button. Click on the *name* of the app and you're good. There are other similar sites; ""cmacapps"", ""mac-torrent-download"" etc."

64338,"The same as any other public site/tracker. Slim to none if you use your brain. But, some stuff slips through sometimes if there aren’t moderators to catch it early and ban the uploader. It’s just part of leaving things open to the public. Folks take advantage sometimes."
