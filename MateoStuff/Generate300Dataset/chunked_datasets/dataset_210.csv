69282,Was your knowledge on colonial influences how you got in? Or else how did you make that transition?
69283,"Because of the other institutions we work with my speaking French is an advantage. We also happen to have projects in the country I focused on for French colonial influence and I was able to impress a visiting scholar from the country with my knowledge of his country's past and present situation. The guy was really cool, I like working with him, and it was a good cause. This led me to volunteer there for 9 months. The combination of this, my being an English speaker, and relative fluency in Mandarin led to my being offered the position.

Honestly, I'm faking it til I make it at this point."
69284,"I would do something in engineering. Either petroleum, computer, or electrical. When I started college I didn't even know what an engineer was."
69285,"I transferred out of the Wharton school at UPenn to major in history and work in a profession that is much more satisfying than the business world.  I'm sure I could have been making a lot more money had I stayed at Penn but I have zero regrets for doing it.  No,  I would not change my major."
69286,"Did you transfer out of Wharton or out of Penn? If you left Penn, where did you go?"
69287,"Out of Penn entirely.  I figured if I wasn't going to stay at Wharton, it wasn't really worth the expense.  I could major in history somewhere else at one third the price,  so I finished at Penn State."
69288,Wow that's really interesting. Thank you for sharing. What do you do now?
69289,"I'd rather not say,  but I've worked in West Africa for almost a decade.  I will say that I'm not in the Foreign Legion or anything like it :)"
69290,"If you'd rather not say, what are common career paths could I take to do what you did?"
69291,Peace Corps or some other organization where you spend time in a developing country would help. You have to prove you can deal with life over here.
69292,"How's the transferring process to Penn state? I'm currently enrolled in a different state honors university but had Penn state as my first choice, declining the offer because i applied and got into a different major-school that i would have preferred.  Anyway, they make it seem near impossible to transfer, having to take up to two years of undergraduate studied before even getting the chance in being admitted to the school of choice."
69293,"Transferring was pretty easy for me, but it was in the late 80's so I don't recall the procedure very well.  I imagine that the red tape has become worse as bureaucracies pile on the rules.  I hear the parties are still fun though!"
69294,"Yeah lol, i visited a friend of mine during the summer sessions up there and the parties were honestly insane"
69295,"I don't know how it was in the 80s, but when I was applying in 2003 you had to start in one of the satellite schools and after 2 years you could transfer to State College. 

My cousin went there, her graduating class was so big they didn't even read everyone's name, they just called the person at the beginning of each row to come up and collect the diplomas so they could pass them down."
69297,"I honestly don't think I would change my major at this point. I majored in MechE and now I am working on an MS in Plastics. I should have studied more, and got a better GPA. I did have a few internships but I think doing research at my university with professors would have been better. As an intern I mostly did menial jobs and 'watched' the real engineers."
69298,"It's hard to get into ""real"" engineering. At the larger companies the people with seniority get to do most of the fun stuff, the new employees get to do all the (for lack of a better term) bitch work like filling out spreadsheets.

I know people that work small companies making significantly less just so they can do something that's hands on and interesting. It'll probably pay off in the long run, they'll be qualified to do consulting before anyone."
69299,I'm a chemist. There's not as much of a need for those as I was told. I'd go with my second choice and be an accountant. FI wouldn't seem so far away with a better salary range.
69300,"Yep, those chem professors had me convinced too but to be fair they were teachers and probably never worked in industry or hadn't in like 10 years. Totally sucks for us though!"
69301,"I would have finished my second major in Decision Science (what they called Data Science before that was a thing) a decade ago. Turns out Data Science actually became a thing, and it pays bank."
69302,"I studied business, but I'd do computer science or computer engineering in a heartbeat today - even though business was good for me, most of what I learned was from books. And I lost the opportunity to connect with smarter people before. I recommend CS to anyone: you can be artistic, make money, meet smart people, and not have to worry about the future."
69303,Really? What can you do with a computer science degree? And would it be worth replacing it for Finance?
69304,"To elaborate on koala's post, so many disciplines are turning to computers, programming and computational work. 

I work with biologists, geneticists, agriculturalists, climatologists (and more) who do more and more of their day to day work, and research work, on computers and clusters that it'd make your head spin."
69305,"In the near future all companies will be technology companies. Read ""Software eats the world"" by Marc Andreessen and you'll understand. Yes, this includes Finance. The next big companies in Finance will be tech companies.

As for what you can do, virtually everything. You'll be better equipped to deal with most jobs by having a CS background and learning what you need specifically afterwards than the other way around. It's easier today, for example, to be a marketer if you have a CS degree and never heard of marketing than if you have a marketing degree."
69306,"I'm an incoming freshman going to Purdue and I've been wanting to go into Computer Science since 6th. I've been teaching myself since then and have been lucky enough to have a high school with 2 CS courses. You can make video games, work for big name companies, work with start ups, work with artificial intelligence/computational intelligence, front end/back end stuff for servers and web, databases, etc. The list literally goes on forever. Just like math, Computer Science can be applied in what seems like every field. And the thing is, once you know a language, you can more easily learn them all. Plus you can do multiple things from the list above. For instance, you can work at a some CS company or whatever, and then in your free time be making indie games or doing research. Honestly, I've been waiting for this moment for a while and am really excited (in case you couldn't tell haha)

My ultimate goal is to do research in AI and make indie games on the side. I hope I can be a part of a project to help create an AGI."
69307,Have you ever dealt with some real AI/CI material? The titles are fancy but have you looked *under the hood* what is it about? I'm just asking because AI is something I would never want to get in as a CS student.
69308,"I graduated with a degree in archaeology and a minor in French literature, and it did fuck all for my eventual career (web dev) besides allowing me to say on my resume that I was a college graduate.  That said, I don't really regret it.  College is often a lot less about what you learn and more about just learning how to learn.  You'll forget the specifics a few years after you graduate, but you'll learn lifelong lessons about time management, planning, socialization and critical thinking skills that will really help you in your adult life."
69309,Alla degree really says is that you have the ability to learn and are able to complete tasks. Your job will end up teaching you most of what you need.
69310,"Did CS, was a good decision.

Finance doesn't seem bad, if you actually care about finance and could imagine having a finance-related job."
69311,"My first job was a systems engineer, Firaxis Software was on one of the floors above us. Let me tell you I got jealous quickly at the pallets of soda getting carted up, people showing up to interviews in jeans, and people drinking beer in the elevator on Friday. I envy the corporate culture of the CS people."
69312,"My employer put in a soda fountain last year instead.  Jeans are acceptable attire, but I usually wear khakis half the time as I lead a small team.  Yes, I'm in IT, but not CS."
69316,"I changed my major from Animation to Film and Television and regret it. If I went back I'd double major in both, take Film so I could learn what I wanted to learn, Animation so I could have a job after school."
69317,"Decided to respond because of your edit. 

I have a finance and law degree. I took finance because I thought it was interesting, challenging and a good degree to have. Not sure how useful it was but it was tough and it has been helpful for my personal investing. 

If you're interested I would definitely do some research into the lifestyle of a lawyer. The money isn't what many expect, the hours aren't either. 

Going to law school also threw a big wrench in my finances. Not sure if it will ever pay off, I was making a decent career before law. 

Not sure if I would change anything at this time but I definitely could have taken an easier undergrad.  The work I do as a lawyer currently doesn't really require much of my financial background"
69318,"Doubled in Computer Science and Marketing. Wish I would have done Philosophy or English instead of Marketing. Marketing is pretty useless for me, and the others woulda been more fun. I'm working in Computer Science regardless."
69319,"I always loved computers, taught myself programming when I was 14, etc. Due to some not great advice and the recent (back then) dot-com crash, I ended up choosing mechanical engineering as a ""safer path"".

I still enjoy it. But with CS, I could enjoy it *and* make twice the salary."
69320,I don't understand why people say CS is so much more profitable than Mech E's. The average Mech E makes way more than the average CS graduate. Sure they make more in Silicon Valley but engineers make a lot more in Houston or Calgary as well.
69321,"yes, accounting, and I would have sat and passed the CPA exam asap after graduation"
69322,I'd get a CS degree with significant coursework in quantitative finance.
69323,I majored in accounting and actually if I could go back I'd consider a technical school instead. Accounting is boring.
69324,What would you do in technical school? Just wondering
69325,I only have grade 11. The only thing I would have done differently is been more wise with my money once I started big boy work.
69326,What kind of work do you do?
69327,I started out working on a drilling rig. Now I do what's called rope access in refineries.
69328,"Gotcha.  Good money in that industry, but sort of dangerous on the drilling rigs, no?"
69329,I didn't go to school. So I gotta do something. Worked on rigs 8 years. Still got all my fingers and toes.
69330,"Well... thats tough. If I had to change or wanted to make more $$ right out of undergrad, I'd change from Environmental Science to Geology.

However, things have worked out nearly perfectly for me and I wouldn't change anything. I got a masters degree - will probably get a PhD eventually and can work in a whole host of industries that I'd enjoy if I wanted. 

But like I said, geology would have been more prudent financially and would have been pretty cool - but as a high schooler/undergrad who was afraid of math, I thought it was all calc and looking at boring rocks."
69331,"I have an MS in environmental science, undergrad in GIS, work has been brutal to find. Have you had a similar situation, or had it gone smooth?"
69332,"I studied math, which was great because I really enjoyed it and it expanded my mind a ton. If I were in it purely to accelerate FI, I would skip college, keep the money, and go to a coding bootcamp. I could probably have saved $300k by now at age 24."
69333,Mind sharing what you are doing now for a living? I am also interested in taking up math in uni!
69334,"Did psychology, would go back and do Biology. It turns out psych is NOT the right major if you want to become a psychiatrist (MD).

I'm doing fine, but IMO, psychiatry has got to be one of the most cake professions out there. You make real MD money and are highly respected, but don't need to go through the incredible daily stress of practicing real medicine. 

In contrast, psychologists and mental health counselors, even at the doctoral level, make *peanuts* (comparatively) to see patients with similar issues that psychiatrists see."
69335,What is the right major for psychiatry then?
69336,"Pre-med, which is basically biology."
69337,"Pre-med really isn't a major, though. Plenty of people with a BA or BS in psychology go on to medical school. Making sure you have the right pre-requisite courses is important. Any major can apply to medical school.

Your comments are highly insulting to psychiatrists and psychiatric care generally. Psychiatrists are physicians first, and they utilize their medical training in their daily practice. 

I work with many psychiatrists. I have seen them punched, screamed at by patients, and have seen firsthand the stressful nature of their work at times. Their work requires a high level of expertise, similar to other specialties within medicine. I think you should withhold making such comments without the experience and knowledge to back them up."
69338,"Was going to say the same exact thing. 

There are no wrong major if your goal is to be a physician ( kinda funny seeing op say ""MD money"" when DO make just as much). GPA/MCAT trumps all 

And since we're in /r/finacialindependence, we might as well talk about the opportunity cost.

First of all, you have to get into a medical school. If you want to match into psychiatry, a damn good one at that. Many people don't get on their first try (average age is 24). 

Then you have to through medical school which is a grueling 4 year. And you better push yourself pretty hard because you want to match into psychiatry. If you can't match into psych... you better be happy with the other specialties. 

Okay so let's say you grades are good enough to get yourself matched into psych. Guess what. There's 4 more additional years of training until you're a full-fledged psychiatrists. And oh yeah, medical school is expensive. 

Cake walk, right?"
69339,"I agree with you that medicine is a hard route, but psychiatry is an easy specialty to match into for the record."
69340,"My history degree is definitely useless. I'm making ok money in sales, but that has nothing to do with my schooling. I think I would get a finance degree if I cold go back.

The grass is always greener, though. Hard to tell the best option, even in hindsight."
69341,Being so passionate about history this truth makes me so sad :(
69342,Yup. I'd dump my IR degree and change to a nursing degree in a heartbeat.
69343,"Are you at a target school? If not, start looking at accounting jobs."
69344,"I started out architecture and ended up adding civil engineering on as a second major. (I would have switched outright but I was more than halfway through and had saved my free electives for the end, so the difference between changing majors and double majoring was only one semester. That seemed worth it to have extra options for jobs upon graduating.) 

If I could go back, I probably would have started as an engineering major with my field undeclared or possibly either CS or finance. However, I probably wouldn't have ended up at the same school if I had stated off as a different major, and then I wouldn't have met my husband and a lot of things about my life now would be very different."
69345,"I got a BS in biotechnology, which would have been alright if I followed it up with a MS or PhD. If I could go back, I would definitely have majored in either nursing or clinical lab science because those two fields have a ton of job openings. They don't earn as much as some others might, but it's great to have the confidence of knowing you could live anywhere and still find a job quickly. For maximum earning potential with just a bachelors, I think computer science or IT is the way to go."
69346,"Ah! I wrote an article on this for the Chronicle of Higher Education right after graduating college. [Stop Asking Me My Major](http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Asking-Me-My-Major/63453/)

Curious to hear thoughts/feedback :-)"
69347,"I changed majors from Poli Sci to Finance while in college and I'm definitely glad I did. My current job is slightly different than what I studied but still in the same field (degree had a focus on credit analysis and lending but I work in investing). 

If I could give you one piece of advice it'd be don't be afraid to explore what interests you while you're in college. If I hadn't explored my options I definitely wouldn't be where I'm at today, working a job I enjoy at a great company."
69348,"I would go back and skip college. Five years I could have been gathering work experience, wasted. I didn't even get to party or fuck chicks so yeah... wasted 5 years."
69349,"I was a political science major in undergrad and I have no major regrets. It was a good match for my skill set at that time, it was super interesting, and I've found fulfilling work in my field in a few different jobs since graduation. 

I do wish I had a stronger quantitative background, but that's more something I think my secondary education should have done better - I think I challenged myself at the level I reasonably could have based on my skills during college and after."
69350,"I wouldn't change mine, but I would study harder and choose my coursework more carefully (e.g. with a career focus rather than only what sounded the most interesting). (Applied mathematics -> eventually became a data scientist). I could have had more skills on my immediate entry to the workforce."
69351,It is just difficult finding a major/a school that i would like to transfer to that would put graduates into jobs. Networking factor is a huge factor in picking which school to go to/what major to stick with.
69352,"In the end, it only matters how heavily your school is recruited in regards to your major.  I'm majoring in accounting and went the CC -> state school route.  I'm enrolled at the #2 state school for my state, which is only a top 30 iirc.  I get offers from the same firms kids from top tier schools get.  In fact, I just signed a contract for an internship with a B4 firm and some of the kids who will be interning with me are from Ivy Leagues.  

Now, if I was going finance, this wouldn't be the case.  IB and the lot specifically pic from top tier schools.  Finance is an extremely difficult major when it comes to recruiting.  It seems you either go IB or bust your ass doing something else for little (compared to acg/CS/eng/SD) pay.

You are also 100% correct about networking.  The kids going to the big firms either know someone on the inside or they went to all the recruiting events and got to know everyone there.  Those are the people getting offers.  Take the time to do it, get the free food/drinks, meet your potential coworkers, and soak it all in.  The school will not ""put you in to jobs"".  You do that yourself.  They simply provide the floor for you to meet recruiters.  That is 100% it.  I wish more people would realize that you need to hunt DURING school to find a job.  It won't magically drop in your lap after you graduate with a piece of paper.

Just Google the majors you're interested in, what the work involves, how recruiting goes, etc. and make a move.  You still have a while to decide."
69353,COmputer science. I did Info Systems/security
69354,Sec risk and assessment at Penn State... What don't you like about info sec?
69356,"does it have to do with your career prospects? I'm getting my BA in social science, I love it but I often get anxiety about future career prospects."
69357,"I majored in finance and graduated 8 months ago. I was really split between some sort of engineering and finance. Sometimes I wonder where I'd be now if I went with engineering, but I'm happy I went with finance."
69358,"I wouldn't change my major (CS), but I would have dropped all the random classes I took in favour of Chinese for four years instead of one."
69359,"I studied Math, Stat, Econ, Religion. Im now getting a MS in CS. I would have doubled in Math and CS and dropped stat. But I did what I loved and the rest followed (CS was just starting at my UG when I was there so it wasn't on my radar at all). 

Finance is good if you want to be a financial analyst/get your financial certifications. Get internships and see what the life is like ( typical hours, lots of certifications, etc)."
69360,"I'm an engineer (BSIE, MS in FPE) I make a pretty good living, but if I could do it all over I'd become a quant."
69361,Majored in engineer. Would have majored in computer science because of how much programming and software are so highly valued in today's society.
69362,"I think I'd keep with my mechanical engineering major, but I would take some more management and business classes. I minored in philosophy, which I'd keep, but there were a few bs classes sprinkled in that would have done me more good if they were more finance related."
69363,"Have a degree in electrical engineering. If I had to go back I'd skip college altogether and focus on building businesses. 

But I'm following a more entrepreneurial path rather than high paying jobs."
69365,"Majored in chemistry, got my masters in atmospheric science.  Have had a good career as a consultant but in retrospect, I wish my undergrad had been chem eng as my provincial govt is trying to declare me unqualified to do my own job (which I have been doing for over 15 years).  Otherwise wouldn't change a thing though, and I'll still be able to do my job, I'll just be getting our 2-years of experience engineer to sign off on my reports....."
69366,Majored in marketing and minored in sales. I don't regret my minor at all and I owe everything to my sales program to where I got to be. My marketing degree is pretty useless though. I wish I did software engineering.
69367,"I majored in animation. If I could go back it would be one of two routes: Creative or not creative. 

Creative I would do web design. 
Non-creative I would do computer science. 

Ultimately, it doesn't matter how much you like what you do if your doing it 8 hours a day. I think web design is atleast something you can go home and have other hobbies. Animation you have to live. My friends who graduated web design have been able to move from job to job almost seamlessly. Unlike me or any of my friends with animation degrees.

I've always been good with computers and made websites and coded in my preteens. Just decided not to do it. I have no idea what I'm doing with my career right now maybe I should go back... Hah..."
69368,I'd quit school sooner and enlist and do what I'm doing now. degrees aren't for everyone.
69369,What are you doing now? If you don't mind me asking
69370,"I got a degree in Film Studies, graduated 7 years ago. Let that sink in. However I have never been wanting for relevant and gainful employment, I worked an IT job through college which has been my ticket to a lot of interesting workplaces, both inside and outside the film industry.

If I went back, I'd likely slow down on finishing the degree and take more math, work hard on learning software development, and finish with a CS degree."
69371,"I got a BA in History, which I have never ever once used directly.  (I DO know how to rite gud, which is a useful skill, but not one that is particularly relevant in higher-paying fields.)  No ragrets, but if you gave me a time machine I'd go back and get a STEM degree.  Knowing what I know now I'd probably aim for something in the aerospace field.  I ended up there and have a MS in it now, but starting over again I wouldn't want to close some of the doors that having a BA does."
69372,"I would go back and not go.  I went before the sky high cost of college, but my job now only requires a GED and 6 months work experience.  I cap out at 135k after 15 years, with a pension after 25.  If I would have just been honest with myself that I hated school, and was not going to a white collar field I would have been better off."
69373,"I did a degree in architecture and a degree in engineering.

If I could go back in time I'd start in engineering and do a masters.  As it is I do pretty well."
69374,Did electrical engineering. Would have minored in nuclear engineering and pursued a master's in it as well. Nuclear is just fascinating to me and the department head made the material so understandable.
69376,"Got my undergrad in music and MM in performance. I love that I play gigs frequently, but nothing is stable. I would go back and do either History or Computer Science."
69377,"It's worthwhile to notice that while Engineering (or whatever) may be the most valuable degree in an objective sense, it's not necessarily what's going to make *you* the most money in the long term.

Best bet is to find something profitable that you can really devote yourself to. Motivation, dedication, and hard work pay off in the long run, and you're not going to devote yourself to something you hate."
69378,"Exactly. I used to ask my fellow engineering undergrads why they went into engineering school. The ones who said ""they make the most right out school"", didn't last long. You have to actually enjoy doing it."
69379,That's why I just switched from Engineering to Biology. I didn't enjoy it enough.
69380,I'm an academic advisor for engineering students. This is the truest statement there is.
69381,My reason for doing Engineering was because I was good at it. I don't necessarily enjoy my work but being competent at the job and making enough money to enjoy hobbies in my own time is plenty good for me.
69382,You can major in whatever the heck you like if you get a minor in computer science and learn how to code.  Biology + CS = biotech software job.  History + CS = code for museums and online databases.  It works like that for basically anything.
69383,Now imagine you *major* in CS!
69384,You end up writing code that helps you write code.

69392,"I'm going into CS. [I really think it's a cool major and field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nKIu9yen5nc).

I've been told that a lot of side-projects will get you a job or at least your foot in the door for an interview, so I should be working a lot on these kind of things when I'm in college."
69393,"""History + CS = code for museums and online databases""

...lol what?"
69394,"It should be noted that you can't be simple, like myself, for CS. If you don't know what you're getting yourself into in terms of stress and the the amount of time that it requires you will not be a happy person. Also if you're bad at time management it might be worthwhile exploring other options."

69401,"Honest advice: no matter your major... If you don't network with people in your department, you're fucked. Nearly every degree has some chance of getting you a job, but if you're not making some sort of connections you're not doing yourself a favor. This advice applies to everyone including those of us that are non-STEM: NETWORK YOUR ASS OFF."
69402,"Yup. In journalism, your grades mean nothing compared to the real-world experience and connections you gain. Newspapers don't really care about your grades, they care about your skills and motivation.

In MBA and law, same deal. MBA is basically a gigantic networking degree. Law, you are not going anywhere if you haven't laid the path ahead of time. Those are the only degrees I can speak on."
69403,"What if your department only has about 4 people in it? Granted, I've taken classes from all of them by now, but who else should I be networking with?

69405,"Accounting, Engineering, Computer Science/Programmer (extremely easy to find jobs).  

Medical field:  Nursing. 

Professional degrees are cool and all, in the long run.  Basically anything a combination of Science and Math."
69406,"If I had it to do over, I would have gone EE instead of CS. Seems like most of the programmers I work with have an EE, and while I can only qualify for the IT/CS type jobs, they can pretty much qualify for every job at our company.

And looking at my old college catalog, it was 14 less units. Damn."

69408,Is CPA included in accounting?I wanna do that.
69409,No. In the United States you must pass an exam in order to earn the CPA title. Source: I'm an accounting major.
69410,"to get licensed, most states require 150 hours (with so many being in accounting), passing the exam, and 1-2 years experience  

basically, you need a bachelors in accounting, then a masters in tax or accounting.  my take is, the AICPA is trying to restrict the number of CPAs to boost earnings.  or trying to raise the 'prestige' of the profession.  i guess they got all insecure rubbing elbows with lawyers and their graduate degrees.  if undergrad accounting is fairly easy to you, graduate school is just more of the same"
69411,"You don't need a masters in accounting. If you have an accounting degree, the additional 30 hours can be in anything. The hard part is the exam. There are 4 sections and the pass rate for each section is under 50%. 
Source: I'm a CPA"
69412,"I've heard how the nursing shortage is false, I'm not sure how credible it was though."

69419,"That too, of course. But that is not the case for most of us. Hell, knowing the right person in general helps. I've scored jobs from professors, peers, family, old co-workers... I mean, the options are endless as long as you're not a total SAP or asshole."
69420,"Or the dicks you shake, depending on your sex.

Edit: mmkay"
69421,Er....I guess that's one way to get ahead.
69424,"> Humans are social creatures at the core. You need to learn that to be successful in life.

Seems like a weird attitude to have. When I am being hired I want to be hired because I am the best for the job, not at shaking hands"
69426,Does ETA mean something other than Estimated Time of Arrival?
69427,Edited to add.
69428,"Let's put it this way. They're not going to hire you if you are incapable of doing the job. If they hire you, it's because they know you can do a decent job. However, you might have a leg up on the competition if you have personal connections with those in charge. Your resume is more likely to be seen, your glowing reviews from those you know will serve you well by placing you above other candidates, etc."
69429,haha good luck getting into medical school with this advice.
69430,"It's kind of strange to see this from a UK medical student perspective as due to doing undergraduate medicine rather then postgrad (like in the US) everyone applies with such similar qualifications that a lot more emphasis is put on volunteering and shadowing experience then grades.

As such you need to know people to get the highly sought and highly competitive shadowing and work experience as everyone applying has all A's."
69431,in IT is it what you know. I started helpdesk but now I am in a director role. only took 9 years but it was all on my own.
69432,It would have taken you less than 9 months if your father or uncle was an exec or knew one.
69433,Welcome to film school.
69434,"It's not about who you know, it's about who knows you."
69435,This is the kind of thing failures say to make themselves feel better.
69437,"See the kid working his ass off? He'll get one of those jobs too, and he won't ever bitch about not being born into money."
69438,Say this to every poor smart kid I went to high school with.  Community college isn't even on the radar when your daily needs aren't being met.
69440,"There's always the food bank, too. My school had an office where if you needed food or other help, they'd connect you with the right agencies in town to help you. There's no reason to starve when you're going to school. Also, if you're really desperate and can't for some reason go to a food bank, get a job at a buffet.  Workers there eat like fat, carb loading monkeys."
69442,"In my field, your ascent is based almost entirely on who you end up working for, since they design the projects anyway.  Your next hiring committee only cares about where you published, which is entirely determined by your last boss.  Pick the right lab, show up, follow the rules, and get put on a Nature paper.  Congratulations, you have a career ahead of you.

You get into this 'top-tier' track by going to a good undergrad school and upgrading from there.  You do *that* by having rich parents."
69443,"Top 5 students in my graduating class? shitty, meanial, low paying jobs. The cokehead who shows up late for every class (if at all)? $30/hr highway inspector job straight out of school."
69444,"The average person doesn't have connections that will make them effortlessly rich. This is just something that people say because they want to feel like victims while refusing to work hard themselves.

Don't get me wrong. Life isn't always fair. In fact, life is extremely unfair. But if you go to college, pick a somewhat useful major, and work 12 hours a day (outside of class) in order to graduate with a 3.9 GPA, you will be fine in life. The average person just doesn't want to put in that kind of work. We think that we're entitled to a job after college simply because we graduated. People take classes and memorize whatever the professor is rambling about rather than reading the books carefully, looking deeper into the topics, trying to find internships to put those skills into action, etc. 

Don't get me wrong... Are there people out there that abuse family connections to make themselves rich, even though they're pretty dumb? Sure. But this isn't even close to being the norm. This is just a cop-out.

One last thing. No, you're not ""secretly incredibly intelligent, but just really lazy so you're not working to your full potential."" If you were as smart as you say you are, you'd work harder."
69445,An ivy league biology degree was worth as much for me as a roll of paper towels. So not biology.
69446,"man... fuck me then 
gen bio from ucsd."
69447,Before I was accepted to med school I was looking at options for a gap year. My upenn bio degree managed to land me several jobs paying 12 dollars an hour. That was it. =/
69448,congrats with med school!
69449,thanks! I hate it! :D
69450,"Med student here as well, but I was a double major in Anthropology and History... the only job that prepared me for was bartending!"
69451,"Hello, fellow gen bio major from UCSD"
69452,"good morning man/lady! it was raining a lot yesterday, so the air is much fresher than usual :)"
69453,duh it's biology. it's like the art major of the science world.
69454,"Define useful.

Useful for the human race: medicine, theoretical physics, aerospace engineering.

Useful for your financial situation: CS, IT, programming, finance, law

Useful for sociability and personal interest: music, art, language, history

Useful for the good of others: education, hospitality, nursing

Your college president is not a fuck-cunt, they wouldn't keep a program running using school funding without having it on good factual authority that the course serves some useful purpose in some way for some people.

That is the beauty of market economy. If it exists, there's a demand for it making it useful somewhere."
69455,"Modern medicine and aerospace engineering wouldn't be possible without CS, for example.

You're right that he should define *useful* but you certainly didn't do a good job defining it."
69457,"CS degree holder with an MBA, and I kind of disagree.  

While the MBA is a nice addition to the repertoire, but it is not needed.  Many engineers here in Silicon Valley move on the marketing or product management without the degree."
69459,"Anecdotal, but my dad did electrical engineering and econ. Seemed to work well for him."
69460,"Also, Engineering BS with an MBA"
69461,"Doesn't matter all that much, really. [Every major's terrible](http://xkcd.com/1052/)"
69462,One day I'll get my PHD in undeclared.
69463,Pretty much sums up how I feel.
69464,"For me, the degree that would do me the most help in the career I want, would be a double minor in English and Creative writing. It might not be an engineering degree in terms of being able to get a job straight our of college, but it's something I'm passionate about doing. To me, that's the most important thing."
69465,"Yep that's why I got my degree in English with Creative Writing concentration. I graduate in May, still looking for a job, but it was worth the 4 years. Plus, we have skills that many employers are looking for, like ability to think quickly, creativity, and most of us have a good handle on grammar and sentence structure."
69466,"Did the same thing as you, graduated last May. I currently write for a travel company and I'm moving to the Philippines in April. I'm not making as much as my friends, but they're stuck in the office and I've been to three continents in the past 9 months."
69467,Where are you studying at right now?
69468,Philosophy: They're in it for the money.
69469,"Behind every philosophy major there is a parent saying ""sometimes you just have to let kids make their own mistakes"""
69470,"Jokes on you, I'm getting a math degree too..."
69472,"i agree with this but these jobs are just as competitive to get as many engineering jobs as their are more applicants and they offer better employment opportunities than most engineering jobs IMO. hard accounting skills are useful, even if you aren't an accountant."
69473,"A Dianetics doctoral degree from Sequoia University, at least according to L. Ron Hubbard."
69474,"Engineering, IT, Finance.

They pay the best out of college."
69475,"Bioengineering with double minors in agriculture and economics. With this, you can invent a way to make money grow on trees."
69476,No one is saying law (sadface)
69477,I hear the law market is horrendous from redditors. Do you have the inside scoop that says otherwise?
69478,"It's not good. But the number of people going to law school is going down, so if that continues and the market increases we may see an upward trend for the legal market in the future. But for people going now, I would recommend trying to get a scholarship."
69479,"I doubt there will be an upward trend- applicants have gone down, but graduates haven't really decreased, plus there was already a huge glut of unemployed/undermployed lawyers. At best it'll stabilize."
69480,"You're certainly correct that at best it is unclear that the market will rebound any, though we'll ultimately have to wait and see what things look like when the economy fully recovers. The only thing I would say is that the only reason graduates haven't decreased is because applications have only been going down the last [two years](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/law-school-applications-are-collapsing-as-they-should-be/272729/), and of course there will be a three year lag from applications going down to graduates decreasing."
69481,"It's bad for the bottom 75%. There's a massive glut of mediocre to average law students who aren't motivated, don't do anything special, don't interview well and don't get jobs. If you can make yourself stand out and kill law school you can turn it in to a good career."
69482,From experience law has a very very high turnover. People who practise eventually get tired of it because their dreams of serving the public is tarnished by the reality that you will most likely be representing millionaires and enforcing the law but not necessarily serving justice. This is why a lot of lawyers become academics.
69483,Isn't it true that only 50% of law school graduates get a job in law? There are a lot of lawyers these days.
69484,"Nursing.

Biggest growth."
69485,But there are a LOT of nursing grads that have been looking for jobs for the past few years after they graduate without luck. (Most of my friends are nursing majors)
69486,"The problem is that a lot of older nurses aren't leaving the workforce. When they start to, the jobs should be there. This unfortunately won't help anyone who has recently graduated or is going to in the short term because if you don't get a job soon after graduation, you're screwed."
69487,"I have a Doctorate in Nursing Practice.

A few points: 

BSN RNs want to largely exclusively work in hospitals.  This is because the pay is better and clinical experience is more rigorous then Long Term Care/Skilled Nursing Facilities.  There are however a limited amount of jobs in hospitals and those are ones that people tend to stay with.

BSN RNs tend to more frequently to want to jump into competitive units (Peds, ED, ICU, NICU, LDRP).

Nursing schools exist often in places where nurses are needed *the least*.  It may be a ""chicken or the egg"" problem here.  The southwest, south and midwest are in significant need for RNs.

Finally, regardless of your view on PPACA it certainly has made hospitals have to reorganize themselves and their care, which explains current hiring lulls.  Additionally in the grand scheme of PPACA it provides  incentives for people spending *less* time in hospitals, moving RNs roles more outside the hospital.

tl;dr - jobs exist in surplus outside of hospitals and in geographic regions not served by nursing schools."
69488,"I think a big part of that is that many places don't want nurses with NO experience.  If they get any sort of internship with clinical experience before applying, I think it'd be much easier to get hired."
69489,maybe its your location?
69490,"They need to jump on down to the southern US. There are so many job openings for nurses these days in GA, it's ridiculous."
69491,"Note: If you're going into nursing purely for the money, Fuck You. Go into it because you're passionate about helping people. Otherwise you're going to be a shitty nurse."
69492,Let me know how that works out in a year. The nursing market is almost totally flooded.
69493,"A large majority of nurses will retire in the next 5-15 years.  Also it depends on your area.  New York, California, and Florida are a little rough right now for nurses, especially new grads.  I live in Virginia and we are hiring nurses all the time.  The new grads that pass their NCLEX the first try after graduation find work within 3 months of graduation."
69494,The demand for cyber security experts is growing at a much faster rate than nursing.
69495,Source needed.
69496,I definitely agree. This thread is rampant with users just making up statistics.
69497,"Mostly because people care much more about asserting to themselves that they made the right decision than assisting random strangers on the internet. It's a predictable result, really."
69498,Not geography.
69499,"When I graduated in 1993 from UNC Chapel Hill in Geography, the mean income for graduates was $500K per year.

Yep- Michael Jordan has a Geography degree."
69500,you are Michael Jordan?
69501,I don't dunk and tell.
69503,"Learning how to make and exploit personal contacts is the most important thing you can learn in college. 
Join a frat. Exploit the alumni. 
Keep in touch with well placed friends. Exploit them. 
Kiss up to your well connected professors. USE THEM.
It's how the real world works."
69504,Which ever one leaves your buns the cleanest after wiping.
69505,Is this an analogy for the one thy leaves you with the least debt?
69506,"I was thinking it was some commentary on eventually being able to afford the best toilet paper.

I was wrong."
69507,"I'm not sure, but I'm thinking he's going more the literal route of wiping your butt with a degree. Basically, the ""it's just a piece of paper"" line of thought."
69508,Try debt vs. expected earnings.
69509,"STEM's (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)"
69510,That's a pretty broad umbrella. Not every single STEM degree is useful on its own. Biology comes to mind.
69511,I'm a bio major. This makes me sad.
69512,"sorry, you picked the art major of the science world."
69513,"Of the bio majors I know, one is teaching ski classes, one went back to his old job as a paramedic, and one works at a coffee shop.  All the other ones went to medical school."
69515,Shouldn't math teachers be incredibly rich then?
69517,Theyve still had to take more math classes than most other majors though.
69519,"Kindof like how on reddit, use of tongue in cheek humor correlates with someone taking it seriously enough to defend a trivial point.

I see!"
69520,Most redditors' perception of humour correlates inversely with how intelligent they think they will sound by correcting you.
69521,Meh. I'm a math major making only 50k.
69522,Yet my neighbour with a STEM degree ended up working at Jessops as a shop assistant.
69523,"Russian Linguistics.

EDIT: Relative username is relative."
69524,Jamie want big boom.
69525,"any engineering degree, comp sci/math, accounting, actuarial science, nursing.

usually degrees with lots of math classes = more jobs"
69526,Agriculture. There will always be a need for a better method to produce more food for a growing population.
69527,"I'm in high school right now, and am seriously  considering a dual business and agriculture degree. Would you know what the job prospects would be? And how difficult would it be to get a job in agriculture?"
69528,"I don't know much about job prospects, but many (maybe all) universities with agricultural programs offer an ""agribusiness"" degree. You should look in to it."
69529,"And a lot of them are state schools (land-grant universities, FTW) so the tuition is cheaper."
69530,"Meteorology degree, because I can make almost 100k a year with just a 4-year degree. Unfortunately it is also hard as fuck to get in four years."
69531,The one you're selling.
69532,ITT: STEM majors hating on Liberal Arts.
69533,"Ok, who's downvoting all the real and helpful answers? Seriously, why?"
69534,"Someone already mentioned STEM's. Also, accounting. My friend got into a Master's program and a guaranteed job at a large accounting firm. He's 22 making $70k + benefits and his salary, bonuses, and paid vacation time will increase every year."
69536,"I would have a Masters at 22, had I not decided to take a year out.

This is the norm in the UK."
69538,"Our courses are much more focussed though, where you have to take on liberal arts classes we dive right into the sciences."
69539,"Yup, he took grad level classes in college and only had to do two semesters of grad school. He also worked for the company as a a well laid intern while in school full time."
69540,Statistics is quite useful.
69541,"On average, yes."
69542,"This.  It's so versatile!  So many people do research and are knowledgeable about their particular topic, but don't have the hardcore stats knowledge."
69543,"find a job that pays well but noone wants to do and study to get it. For example, Accountants make pretty good money, but noone wants to be an accountant because it's the most boring and soul-crushing job in the world. hence, I am becoming an accountant so that I can afford to drink myself to death on relatively expensive cognac out of desperation and to dull the feeling that my life could have been so much better. Plus, you'll learn how to do your taxes well, so that's a plus."
69544,"Whatever your degree is in is basically irrelevant if all you do is go to classes. Become bff with your profs. Befriend your department administrator. I have had some kick-ass part time jobs throughout undergrad and grad school because I made an effort to apply the stuff I learned in class, making my arts background stronger."
69545,The most useful degree is the one you make use of
69546,"Useful in a practical sense?  Agriculture/farming

Useful in the real world?  Comp Sci/STEM/Business/Accounting/Stat/Math/Econ"
69547,"Anything business.

Or really, just anything. American society uses the 4 year degree to discriminate. If you have one, you're in. If you don't, you're out. Throw an internship and a fraternity membership in there and you're freaking golden.

Not to say you can't make a decent living without a degree, but it will be a whole shitload easier with one."
69548,A doctorate. Bachelors' aren't worth crap nowadays
69549,"Actually, every article I've read lately says PhDs aren't worth the time/cost unless you want to go into academia.

Edit: And I'm a PhD student"
69550,"Yeah, PhDs are way too specialized.  With a bachelor's, you have the flexibility to make lattes at Starbucks one year, and then call back on your college experience once something better paying opens up.  With a PhD, everyone assumes you have no interest in anything but your field of study and wouldn't want to throw your degree away doing something unrelated."
69551,"BS

See what I did there? :)"
69552,What about masters?
69553,"Depends upon what you are studying. Economics or finance, yes, bare minimum. Journalism, probably not. If you want to teach, probably."
69554,"Economics and finance are not the same.  Finance majors have an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent.  Economics is at 6.3 percent.  [Source.](http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/NILF1111/#term=)  The difference seems small, but 5.5 percent is the ideal.  Anything above that, and you're going to have people who are chronically unable to find work in their field."
69555,accounting?
69556,I really hope computer science is the way to go.
69557,"MA in Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Langusge. You can go anywhere, teach anyone, and make decent money doing it too if you play your cards right."

69560,Im hoping my Human Resources and Pyschology mix pays off.
69561,"Anything in IT probably, IT is just booming and will only get bigger"
69562,Classics.
69563,"The ""B's"" work for the ""C's"" and the ""A's"" teach --- 30 years working and this is the rule, live by it, and adapt to it. The theory is the ""C's"" will take risks, start companies, the ""B"" is too hesitant and will end up working fo the ""C"" -- the ""A"" will stay in Academia since it worked so well for them and thereby have no other option. Trust me on this, either accept your fate or figure out some loophole, otherwise you will just suffer. This is ""The Google Problem"" right now, they higher all ""A's"" (I've interviewed twice there) and they keep making things that are good on paper,  but have no appeal to the real market. This is because they have the ""A's"" in charge and need to reorganize. Long-term: they won't figure this out, will keep making ""Google Wave"" type products (look at the recent Google laptop), and will continue to dilute the brand until they are HP."
69564,"Nursing degree, there isn't a place in the US right now that *doesn't* need nurses, which may be an exaggeration to an extent, but as the demand goes up, so does the salary."
69565,nursing or physical therapy. baby boomers are getting older.
69566,"Everyone here is talking about most useful in the sense of what gets you the highest paying job; who is to say useful = high paying job? 

It could also mean, which college degree gives you the best learning experience"
69567,Business.
69569,"Management information systems. All the knowledge of business, but with all the tech knowledge too."
69570,One that you enjoy. Either make a bunch of money and hate most of your life. Or live in moderation and enjoy most of it. Your pick. Bonus points to you if you can make a bunch of money and enjoy doing it.
69571,"Computer science. So much growth in jobs there, and starting salaries are not bad."
69572,"If you're a journalism major, getting involved in student publications/media is way more important than classes. Journalists aren't hired based off of their degree, but how well acclimated they are to newsrooms, deadlines, etc. You can't learn the trade in the classroom, only in the field. Classes are to just help you refine your skills and the little things

EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that classes are useless. The degree itself pretty much is, but most of my professors are accomplished/active journalists so they have so much to teach students that really is invaluable. The classes do matter to help you in the field."
69573,"Oh, absolutely. I started hanging out in the newsroom of my school the first week of my freshman year. It boggles my mind how there were journalism majors who just didn't want to get involved but were still convinced their degree would get them by."
69574,"It's more nice to have. For me, I've learned so much about AP style, tactics and tips in the field. It's easy to learn but hard to master"
69575,"Stand-alone language majors.

How are you, student learning a language in <4 years, going to compete with a bilingual speaker who also has skills for the workforce?

You **must** pair it with something else. If you want to major in a language, you double major."
69576,"Was looking for this. I can not tell you how many people major in a language (without study abroad) and think they are going to be able to move to that country and work there.

I did German and Linguistics (double major) and am doing my masters in Germany with the intention of teaching English as a Second Language. Some of my friends just majored in French or German and planned on moving over here and getting any kind of job."
69577,"I can speak German and my colleague put it best ""Your degree in German isn't useful in Germany. You may be surprised, but many people can speak it there."""
69578,"My German professor said something similar. Before I declared a second major, he told me to find a comfortable bridge to sleep under."
69579,And they say German has no sense of humor
69580,"Without study abroad??? **Noooooooo. **

Heck, I did a language *minor* and some of my classmates complained that it’s not printed on the degree so they “can’t” put it on their resume for some prestige. I’ve brought many to light that if your language skills are good enough you *can* put [Language - Proficiency], and that you don’t have to put it on if you can’t speak the language anymore.

And congrats with your studies!"
69581,"Hold on, who says that you can't include your minor on a resume? That's how I got my job, in a completely unrelated field from my major..."
69582,"Yeah, I don’t know why they originally thought they couldn’t - although they shouldn’t unless they’re confident in their language abilities imo"
69583,Double Major in Russian Language and Politics
69584,The US government lists Russian as a critical language. There are plenty of jobs in the State department for people with Russian proficiency.
69585,Good to know since I speak Russian and am trying to figure out what to do in life. Thanks!
69586,"Look into critical language scholarships or Russian flagship program. There's a need, and plenty of money being put toward addressing that need."
69587,"Hey man, you can *do* something with that! I mean, as long as you *really can* speak Russian. And if you’re in government work for 10 years, your loans are forgiven!"
69588,Or just show up to class every day and the teacher will just *give* you a minor
69589,I understand that you are the machine
69590,For that you have to sign up for the class trip to russia over tje summer
69591,"I knew someone who managed to major/minor in four separate languages at the same time, all while earning a PoliSci degree. Dude is making bank now."
69592,What industry is he working in to make said bank?
69593,"He works as a translator in the military. Every time he posts he's in a new, more awesome location."
69594,"Absolutely. Anyone studying a language should learn something substantial in addition. I have a degree in journalism but every job I have ever had (journalism, research, marketing etc) , I got because I one-upped other applicants with my language skills. I didn't need a degree in a language but granted, my background enabled me to learn languages as part of my life.


If you really wanna learn a language and study the culture, history etc, you should also look into acquiring additional skills and experience in other fields."
69595,"I did this. I really loved getting to study a language I'd wanted to learn for a long time, but now that I'm graduated, having to explain I'm not fluent in the thing I fucking majored in is kind of even worse than having one of the ""generic"" degrees people tend to look down on that are easier to explain away, like psychology and communications.

If I could, I'd go back and tell 17-year-old me to do differently! But, I can't. :/"

69604,"Minor in that. It's a good passion, but the job market is shit."
69605,"My mom did something similar, she didn't know what to major in but didn't want to be undecided so closed her eyes and pointed to a random major, her plan was to start the general requirements and figure out what she wanted to major in later. Never found anything she wanted to major in, so she ended up graduating with her random degree, and she's now been an RN for 25 years while still trying to figure out what she wanted to do. Telling this story I'm realizing where my extreme indecisiveness came from."
