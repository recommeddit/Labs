59429,"So I started making a list, but stopped. It's just too hard, lol. Some of these new found loves are amazing, and I wouldn't want to necessarily exclude them. After sniffing and owning hundreds and hundreds, I think I'm doing 'okay' with around \~95 different scents.  

One thing remains though, Kouros is #1! :)"
59430,Always preferred Antaeus. Kouros is great I admit also. Old school 80s powerhouse

Also CdG Black was done by Guillaume Flavigny (which I learned because I also love it, and wanted to find other stuff he'd done)."
59433,How would you describe CDG Black? Floriental is a very nice fragrance from them.
59434,"Obviously from its #2 spot, I think it's awesome.  It's a big tarry smoke note (some people say leathery, but idk), heavy incense, wood, with some spices (black pepper, the notes say licorice, I get clove as well).  It feels very moody and dramatic to me. If you go for smoke and dry incense/wood stuff, it's a must-try."
59435,"I do go for mainly that kind of stuff! Ooo now I need to sample Black, I just bought Floriental which I absolutely love."
59436,"I hope you like it!  I should also mention it skews sliightly on the masc side of unisex, but I'm a woman and I wear it no problem.    Also, if you like dry smoke/incense/wood stuff, Blackpepper is another CdG to try.  It's pepper, for sure, but also mesmerizing wood and incense.

I need to find a sample of Floriental, I only tried it on paper in a store years ago, but I've never properly tried it."
59437,"Floriental is more flowery but simultaneously, not flowery at all. Idk why it‚Äôs called Floriental but that is CDG‚Äôs philosophy I see. 


I‚Äôll try out both & unisex/Colognes are the fragrances I absolutely love!!"
59438,Heeley is super underrated. That salt note! So many other great fragrances from this house.
59439,I've only tried Sel Marin and Note de Yuzu from Heeley and I love them both.  Dying to order some samples of some others.  What else do you recommend from them?
59440,"Great list!!! Arso??! üò≥ well, I think I must try to wear it in my city... Maybe there is a chance at least one human will like it without questionable thoughts."
59441,"Whaaat, Arso's not so out there!  Unless you live someplace super hot, you could pull it off no problem."
59442,"Nice. Black is a brilliant fragrance, that completely decimates Patch 24 by Le Labo. Good to know the perfumer also"
59443,"For real.  I've never tried Patch 24, but with Black around, I'm hardly in need of alternative big smoky fragrances."
59444,"Hi,
I'm interested in Wonderoud, have you tried Wonderwood to compare?"
59445,"I actually haven't tried Wonderwood (very embarrassing given my flair and status as #1 CdG fan on this sub), though I'm ordering a sample soon.  I have heard a lot of people call Wonderoud a riff on Wonderwood, though, so I think they must be similar.  Wonderoud is amazing and definitely worth a sample, though.  It's primarily sandalwood (sort of shares a base with Blue Santal), no oud to speak of.  Same perfumer as Blackpepper, Hinoki, Laurel, Blue Santal."
59446,"Wonderoud is smoother and less bitter than Wonderwood.  Funny because I thought I would prefer the oud-less version, but perhaps as you said Wonderoud doesn't actually have real oud."
59447,"You prefer Wonderoud then?  And yeah they say it's got natural oud oil in there, but I'll be damned if I can smell it at all. Maybe it has like, half a drop per bottle."
59448,"Sorry if I wasn't more clear.  Yes,  I prefer WonderOud  because it's less bitter."
59449,"I like your style! Arso, Philosykos, Sel Marin, Timbuktu, Fior Fiore (criminally underrated), and Passage d'Enfer are all quite wonderful.

Have you ever tried Profumum Roma's Inchusa? I prefer it to Philosykos... it's bitter with myrtle and doesn't rely on the cliched fig/coconut accord, more about the tree than the fruit. It's a really interesting and herbal take on fig. Judging by the overlap in our tastes, you might like it."
59450,"Wow we *do* have similar taste!  I don't know if I've ever run into another fan of Fior Fiore.  And I also love Ichnusa.  When I first tried it, I was really taken with it, but then my roommate made the connection to a cleaner that's common in malls/restaurants in the Middle East, where we both used to live, and I can't unsmell it. I actually just busted out my sample of it when I saw this, and it's still amazing (though I'm still haunted by the mall bathroom association).  If I had a top 30, it'd be there."
59451,"Ah, that's a bummer about Ichnusa! It's so beautiful--isn't it weird how one strange association can make you think differently about a scent? 

Fior Fiore made me reconsider pear. I'd always thought it was too sweet, but I was intrigued by a scent that emphasized the muskiness, rather than sweetness of pear. I think I prefer something greener (am testing Cartier's Carat which may be a contender) but Fiore is quite good and definitely one of my favorites from the recent pear trend."
59452,How is the longevity and performance of Ichnusa compared to Phylisikos?
59453,I haven't tried Philosykos in years but Profumum's longevity is excellent. Even their freshies last 10hrs+
59454,Thank you! My curiosity is definitely piqued

59458,"This list was tough and to be honest not totally ""accurate"", but this is as close to a top 20 as I could get. I've seperated them into 3 categories.

**The Best Smelling Fragrances In My Collection** ‚óΩ**Aventus** is an easy no. 1 because of the smell (one of the best I've ever put my nose on), it's versatility and compliment factor. **Rose 31** would've been no. 1 but it's a shell of it's self since it was reformulated around 2014. Still great though. These aren't perfect, but they're my favorite to smell at the moment.

1. **Aventus** (Creed)

2. **Creation E Parfum Pour Homme** (Roja Parfums)

3. **Straight To Heaven Extreme** (By Kilian) 

4. **Single Malt** (By Kilian)

5. **Rose 31** (Le Labo)

6. **Tuxedo** (Yves Saint Laurent)

**The 2nd Tier** ‚óΩThese don't smell as great as the first tier but still amazing scents. Some of these are my most worn fragrances.

7. **Arcana Rosa No. 9** (L'Artisan Parfumeur)

8. **Herod** (Parfums De Marly)

9. **Bleu De Chanel** (Chanel)

10. **The One EDP** (Dolce & Gabbana)

11. **Grey Vetiver EDT or EDP** (Tom Ford)

12. **Royal Oud** (Creed)

13. **Acqua Di Gio Profondo** (Giorgio Armani)

14. **Terre D'Hermes Vetiver Eau Extreme** (Hermes)

15. **Tobacco Vanille** (Tom Ford)

16. **Italian Leather** (Memo Paris)

17. **L'Homme** (Yves Saint Laurent)

18. **At The Barbers** (Replica Maison Martin Margeila)

**Amazing Fragrances I Find Hard To Wear** ‚óΩAwesome fragrances, but I have some difficulty wearing them. I live in a pretty warm climate (New Orleans) so I already have limited opportunity to wear thicker, heavier fragrances, but these 2 are even more limited in that they feel VERY formal (especially **Coromandel**, which is also pretty feminine leaning imo).

19. **Portrait Of A Lady** (Frederic Malle)

20. **Coromandel** (Chanel)"
59459,Interesting your find Corramandel hard to wear!
59460,"Yeah, it's warm where I am more often than not and I find this to be a very cold weather scent.

Also, like I said, it seems very, very formal and upscale. I find it hard to wear casually. That's just me üòïüòÅ"

59462,"20 best perfumes that I wear and own. If it was just the ""20 best perfumes ever"" I'd have quite a different list, as there are several I consider works of art but don't wear/own/like on myself.

59463,"I'm over here taking notes and adding to my to-sample list.  Definitely got to get a Hendley discovery set and a sample of Noir Anthracite and Wolf Spirit, they sound up my alley.  What's Fleurs de Citronnier like?  I loooove actual lemon blossoms, but I never seem to find lemon blossom perfumes that do them justice.

 I actually just gave my sample of Tucson a second try the other day and found it lovely.  Reminds me of hiking in the mountains with my grandpa. Carosello is also super interesting."
59464,"Heck yes, Hendley is absolutely worth a sniff. His stuff is top notch, and his iris and rhu khus are to die for. 

Solstice Scents is awesome; their sampler set is worth the $$$. They have a lot of earthy, naturalistic scents. Can definitely help you narrow down the options if you're thinking of getting samples :)

Fleurs de Citronniers is like a creamy lemon soap. There's a sort of sweetness, not a candy sweetness, which makes me think of Meyer lemons. And the musk is super sexy... it reminds me of the musk in Muscs Khoublai Khan, without all the vanilla and spices. It can be temperamental though... sometimes the musk adds the perfect animalic counterbalance to the soapiness, sometimes it veers a bit into the fecal territory. I find it's better on skin than clothing."
59466,Hehe
59467,"Chanel Coco, Chanel Egoiste, Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche (I know perfume snobs degrade it but it‚Äôs just so perfect!) Allure Homme line mainly the original & Blanche! Burberry Brit. 


Malle French Lover, Malle Dries Van Noten & some
Of the MFK fragrances."
59469,"IKR! It‚Äôs one of my top favourites! Straight smells like a fresh cologne, only softens a bit when the jasmine enters but the teak wood dominates... I absolutely LOVE it!"

59476,"I am going to say you are a bold, but quiet. Venturing to guess that you are under 35 and are not from the United States.

59486,"Ooh okay, this is eclectic. Also very good taste. I'm not sure on gender, but a few things have me leaning towards a woman, and I'm going to guess based on some of the darker scents that you aren't overly femme. Like, it feels like you'd rock a fashionable pantsuit. Probably late-20s and in some kind of artistic field. Not necessarily fully like an artist, but graphic design, working in an art gallery, something like that."
59487,"thanks! and right on about pretty much everything! i‚Äôm a social worker but also do a fair amount of writing, so i‚Äôd say that‚Äôs somewhat artistic :)"
59488,"A social worker with the money to buy fragrance? I don‚Äôt buy it :-P haha. For real though, dealing with the stuff social workers have to deal with counts as an artist to me."

I'm 46 and live in a small town of 10000 people.  I'm not management, I work for the Town council and  I don't have any kids, hence the frag collection."

59511,"You got the middle aged man bit right,  I think anyone would have struggled to guess with the frags in my list!"
59512,"Interesting, I was thinking 35-40. Great cohesive taste imo, I feel like you get a good somewhat equal wearing out of most of your favs. Always been in a small town? I feel like in your youth perhaps not, maybe not big city but perhaps a more busier area than currently."
59513,"Spot on, I love them all and they all get used depending on the weather. I have always lived in my home town but spent 16 years,starting when I was 15, working in a town  with a population of around 100000 people."

Most men would be scared to wear such striking, traditionally feminine perfumes, so I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre a woman, probably past your twenties. You‚Äôre confident and put-together,  sharp as a tack, occasionally intimidating, but also somebody that people trust.

Thanks! I'm 28. I really do like whiskey, but I don't drink it since I have a feeling I won't stop. I lived in Siberia for 7 years, that's why I tend to wear such fragrances.

You are a stylish, extroverted person (probably a guy) who holds themselves to high standards. You present a strong but not narcissistic image of yourself to others. I imagine you‚Äôre between 28 and 38 and very successful in your profession. The warm, sweet, and woody elements in many of these speak to a more reserved, sensual side that you like to hint at but not display openly all the time. You‚Äôre quite fashionable, but warm, and very open with those you know well."
59585,">I can tell you‚Äôre an experienced connoisseur of fragrance

Eh, been at it a little over a year but it's definitely something I spend time on every day.

Not really :/

Definitely.

>I imagine you‚Äôre between 28 and 38 and very successful in your profession. The warm, sweet, and woody elements in many of these speak to a more reserved, sensual side that you like to hint at but not display openly all the time.

Pretty close, I'm in my early 40's and am mostly pretty reserved except when I'm not.

>You‚Äôre quite fashionable

Not really...

>but warm, and very open with those you know well.

Pretty much."
59586,"Haha well I did my best! The most important thing is for fragrances to project the image of yourself that you want the world to see, and it seems like you‚Äôre def doing that! You have great taste!!"
59587,"Haha, that's definitely the way I see it!  Thanks!!!"
59588,"You're mild mannered, on the higher strung / anxious side, and though you present outwardly calm no one would accuse you of being ""laid back."" You think a lot about quality and refinement in the things you consume, but you're not fussy and probably don't like to draw a lot of attention to yourself. You're probably easy to overlook at a party as you're not the type to take center stage, but those who have the patience to get to know you inevitably appreciate your good nature and constancy, and most of your intimate relationships with friends and partners are very long lasting."
59589,"Wow, you're pretty much dead on!  I'm super curious what scents led you to those conclusions and why?!"
59590,"Hmm, it's hard to say. Each of these scents gives me a feeling, and taken together it's a kind of symphony where I get a sense of your vibe. From that it's just a matter of trying to put words to that vibe. 

In general they're refined, thoughtful scents, that give a sense of restraint but also taste. I don't know why but taken together they seem like they would appeal to someone of the above description.

More of a potshot, but are you from New England or Britain?"
59591,"Well, I must say you really seem to know your stuff and you've done a fine job!

I'm suburban Minnesotan born and bred, there is a certain brand of ""don't be trashy/high strung/but don't notice me too much"" common to a lot of similar geographic areas though!"
59592,"Ahh yea I can see that; I almost added Midwest in there, but it seemed so broad as to be cheating, lol. Totally agree on the regional similarities."
59593,"My wild guess based on your selection, dear op, is that you're within the first 5-10 years of your career and unsure if you want to stick with it or attempt a change.  You've gotten a few raises so are hesitant to start at the bottom somewhere else, but unsure of how to make a ""lateral"" change to a completely different field.  You used to wear high heels, but are finding your tolerance for foot pain is decreasing."

You come off easygoing and that's mostly true, but you when you have trauma/grief you tend to mask it so as not to bother others, so most people don't know it when something's up with you unless they're on your very (very) short list of intimate confidantes.

I think you have a good eye for detail, so I bet you enjoy cooking and eating complex dishes but also enjoy something more simple and straightforward that's made with high quality ingredients. 

I'd guess that you like pop culture and occasionally binge shows on Netflix/Hulu/etc. You enjoy some reality tv occasionally. You have a curated sense of style; the people in your life can easily identify your look and taste."

59675,"It really depends on what you like. Do you like light, powdery scents? Floral? Citrus-y? Green? Personally, my favourite light scents are Frederic Malle L'eau d'Hiver (as the name suggests, like a first snow), Prada Infusion d'Iris (powdery iris), Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt (although this one isn't really that light on me), and Annick Goutal Mandragore (almost a spicy, green citrus; rather hard to describe). I like the Hermes Jardin line very much as well - they're fairly light and aquatic/green, like if Monet's watercolours were rendered into perfume form."

Versace Yellow Diamond (EdT) is a pretty fruity floral, quite affordable too.

Many Jo Malones will check that box, Bluebell is a nice one.

MMM Springtime in a Park is a nice fresh floral with lovely green notes."
59683,Springtime in a Park is such a good one! Always makes me happy when I smell it
59684,Perfect! I‚Äôll check these out. Thank you so much üíï
59685,"Just wanted to add that Versace Bright Crystal would be another good one to try that‚Äôs quite affordable. It is very fresh, with a rose note. I remember that I got mini sizes of this and the Yellow Diamond on Amazon. I checked to see if they still had them and ran across this little gift set that has the two plus Crystal Noir. I like that one too, it has a sensual vibe to it imo, with a coconut note. A nice evening fragrance. I think you can still get these individually as minis too, but here‚Äôs the set if you‚Äôre interested, for about $30.

59701,"If I‚Äôm trying to be low key, then my Egyptian musk oil. It has lasting power but doesn‚Äôt radiate."
59702,how does it smells like ?
59703,"Warm musk, sweet natural florals, and a tad earthy. Hard to describe because it smells so different on everyone. But it smells so good on everyone too. 

I used to get mine at a local incense and oil shop but it closed down. If you‚Äôre looking to buy it, Auric Blends sells on Amazon for about $10. That‚Äôs been the closest to the one I‚Äôve been buying, the oil is just not as thick."
59705,"My day time go to is currently Prada Infusion de Iris.

It‚Äôs woodsy, floral, light, powdery, but not overwhelmingly so. It has non of the saccharine sweet ‚Äúfemininity‚Äù that many modern perfumes for women have buckets of. Feels sophisticated without relying too heavily on ‚Äúsexy‚Äù notes. And is subtle enough to wear in the office so I don‚Äôt knock people out with my fragrance."

Kate Spade Truly Dazzling - a salty water lily beauty that stands out among all my freshies and is an easy reach. I think the Truly line may be getting discontinued, but I still see bottles at Ulta on sale if you can snatch one up.

Dior Addict EDT - similar to Versace Bright Crystal but nicer IMO. Zesty and fresh with musk in the base. Good for really hot days.

Philosophy Amazing Grace - has a soapy quality and is floral, too. I find it to be refreshing and it just smells pretty to me.

Pacifica French Lilac - fresh lilacs

Jo Malone English Oak and Hazelnut - simple, sharp and woody. The opening has a citrus smell to me that gives it that sharp quality. 

Atelier Cologne C√®dre Atlas - Heavier on the bergamot/citrus notes than JM English Oak and Hazelnut. Woody and clean with a strong citrus character. 

Chanel No. 5 L'Eau - sparkling but also fuzzy (I know that's vague). This smells well blended to me; I can't pick out individual notes. There is a floral quality but it's not sweet or too strong.

J-Scent Roasted Green Tea - starts strong and bitter but that goes away in a second. It's a little citrusy, a little creamy and sweet. I do smell green tea. It reminds me of Replica Tea Escape but TE is smoother, creamier, and sweeter, and has less emphasis on the green tea than RGT. 

Hermes Un Jardin Sur le Toit - green, grassy, apples. Sweet but refreshing too, very green. It feels sunny and happy. 

Diptyque L'Eau Rose - light and fresh rose w/ stem and leaves."

59725,"My go-to is Calvin Klein Eternity Air Woman. Really light and ethereal - really just like air. It's really inexpensive on Fragrancenet / Gift Express and it's a 100 ml (pretty) bottle too.

A la Tania Sanchez in the book ""Perfumes: The Guide,"" I really love this one, so I already have a backup bottle. Scared it might be discontinued one day, being a ""flanker""..."

59727,"- BdK Bouqet De Hongrie - it reminds me of D&G Light Blue but is imo somewhat softer and more feminine.
- Berdoues Somei Yoshino - an everyday fragrance I use when I just can't decide on what to wear. Soft, floral cherry blossom but without being powdery."
