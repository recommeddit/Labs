3250,How much was your PC if you don’t mind me asking? I’m trying to make the jump from console and would love to do it as inexpensively as possible
3251,"You can see my pc [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2L2fyk). It's worth about $800. But you could get it cheaper by removing an SSD, getting a cheaper Case. Not getting an aftermarket cooler, etc, etc.  Also Im not including mouse/keyboard, monitor, etc.  


I would say to get into pc gaming a good amount of money to buy EVERYTHING, including monitor, etc, would be around $800/1000 new. And $500/800 used."
3252,"Alright, thank you!"
3253,"Plus, r/buildapc would be happy to help after you get an idea of what you are thinking of building, they help make ""budget"" pc's all the time"
3254,"One thing I would say is you may well come across the issue OP was discussing in that subreddit too. I asked around there when building my pc and most people were pushing me to get better parts when I already stated I was spending £1000 MAX.

I have the PC I decided on and stream everything on ultra with no issues at all but the advice I was being given said I'd struggle. People love to spend other people's money."
3255,"YES ! When I say I have a $1k budget, I want to spend $800 not $1200 lmao."
3256,"That's fair but for the ones I've looked at for every person going above the given range there's another going below, though to be fair most of them do seem to like getting as close to budget as possible even if that means one much newer/better part than the others"
3257,Hmm strange I haven't come across any going below the budget. Might just have caught an odd bunch on my post.
3258,"Was it said it was a hard budget, and was it maybe not do-able under budget?

I dunno, just thought it'd be nice to point someone where at least some know what they're talking about and are willing to help."
3259,If you’re gonna start looking for parts join r/buildapcsales it’s got soooo many deals posted every day. Especially with the holidays/sales this season
3260,"I will get down voted for this but you can stream with a inexpensive PC.   Here is a link to a Alpha Gaming Channel video where they were able to stream for less than $150.  

[Alpha Gaming Channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gjw5GgjzQs)"
3261,Nope this is exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for!
3262,Just curious. Why not only get one ssd and keep the wraith cooler and use that 120$ on a better graphics card?
3263,"I didn't buy the whole computer in one day. I had a FX 8350 + Gtx 760.
So this is how my upgrades went:
Black friday of 2018: RX 580
January 2019: SSD + Monitor
September 2019: CPU + RAM + MOBO
Black Friday of 2018: Case + Cooler + SSD

So, I basically went upgrading whatever I needed to make my pc better. Now the only thing that's left is the GPU (again). But I can play most games with it, so I'll just save up for a few months and see if I buy a RTX 2080"
3265,"lower chance of frame drops due when streaming at a higher preset due to the extra cores and threads id assume, but the IPC improvement of zen 2 does give a good amount more FPS. 2700x still worth it if you arent picky about that, and if you maybe plan to render things too since the multi core is still faster"
3266,"I bought a Ryzen 7 2700x for a dedicated streaming computer and... well, long story short, it doesn't have integrated graphics. So be aware of that.

I also use this computer when rendering out video files (which I really need to do more often), and it is *substantially* faster at this task than the i7-7700k in my main/gaming rig. I did need to update the UEFI on my board, though. I was having a ton of performance and stability issues before."
3267,If you decide to go with a 2700x then get the 2700 and oc it yourself for additional savings. During the prime day sale I picked up my 2700 for ~150 bucks which was a 50 dollar savings over the 2700x at the time.
3268,">And some people WILL TELL YOU you need at least a Ryzen 7 3700x + 32gb of ram, or a RTX Video card, to use as a stream encoder.

This very rarely happens."
3269,32gb ram and ryx video cards arent super expensive. Nothing wrong with those recommendations. Of course 16->32gb is just quality of life though.
3270,"The toolbox fallacy right there. Refusing to start doing things you want to do because you're ""missing"" something."
3271,"I streamed for over a year doing arts & crafts and gaming exclusively from the native app on my PS4 and using the Streamlabs app on my phone. A YEAR. Now thanks to my hard work and the generosity of my viewers I have a great mid-range PC and I can do way more. But I'm glad I worked my way up to it rather than shelling out up front. If you are considering streaming, do what you can with what you've got. If it's the right path for you, you'll find the motivation and resources  to get better equipment, etc. Besides, it excites your long-time followers to help you achieve those goals! Streaming is pretty much all about those goals... :)"
3273,"When someone asks me what to get for starting out I normally give the ""budget"" option and the ""I'm serious about doing this"" option.

If they want to do it as a hobby it's the c270 ($20), a cheap USB condenser mic ($40), lighting($20), and a $500 PC build (which I need to update at some point because it's outdated now and probably cheaper). all in you're looking at around $700 after tax.

The ""lets treat this like a business"" starter kit is a 922($50), lights($80), XLR mic ($40 used from guitar center), cheap audio interface like the Scarlette 2i2 ($160), a PC north of $1000 (also needs updating might be cheaper now), optional green screen(+$30 if bundled with lights), stream-deck mini ($60 if on sale if not on sale full stream deck at $150). All in there it's between $1400-$1600 and there's still room to grow."
3274,Explaining both options is a great idea.
3275,"What exactly are the benefits of a stream deck? Is it basicly just needed if you play multiple games in a session/want multiple things displayed on screen? like, I mostly play 1 game when i stream, so i dont quite understand the need for the deck"
3276,"It does a lot.  


Any OBS actions can be triggered with the press of a button.  


play sounds or DJ in stream  


You can go live, tweet, post canned responses or scripted messages in chat from a single button(all at once or in intervals)  


Basically it's for automating some of your workflow to make your streaming experience more streamlined."
3277,"I got one recently it's amazing how simpler it makes scene transition etc

Yes I could bind some keys anyway but I like the custom layout and ease of it 

Def worth picking up if you have the money, not essential just a nice QoL update"
3278,"same, picked up a stream deck on black friday for like $69.99 or something rediculously cheap! LOVE it.. being able to change my twitter name when I go live, swap scenes, quick clip, etc."
3279,"Isn't a steam deck basically a bunch of buttons you can bind stuff to? So you can do like quick screen transitions, sounds bits, emote sets, etc. If I'm not mistaken on functionality of course.

Which basically means it's mostly convenience or entertainment purposes afaik"
3280,"I had the same question when I saw the stream deck. I found the mini on sale for 60% off at Best Buy and figured I'd return it in a week. I absolutely can not imagine streaming without it now. It seriously upped my streaming game from the first day I had it. 

The main thing I use it for is super easy macros. The companion app lets you drag and drop actions so you can press one button and have it do countless things. I have buttons set up for camera zooms, sound effects, incoming and outgoing raids, muting and unmuting, switching scenes in interesting ways. I highly recommend picking one up."
3281,"If you use it to its full potential, the Stream Deck is an amazingly powerful tool. It can be used for a whole slew of things, but here's an example of my basic stream workflow:

Press a button that turns on my lights, boots OBS, boots Chatty (IRC-based Twitch chat program), and opens the Twitch creator dashboard. I used to have this also open Twitter, but have kinda moved away from that platform for no good reason.

Here I spend some time getting the game running, setting a title, that sort of thing.

Press a button to enable my setting up scene and toggle a few sources. I actually have one scene handle start/end/brb screens, I just have all the elements for them in layers that the Stream Deck turns on and off based on which version I'm requesting. It then goes live and starts playing my intro media (music, in my case).

Do the normal starting stuff - ensure I have transcoding, the stream is stable, get a drink...

Press a button, and it goes to my normal gameplay scene and unmutes my mic audio source. I have a bunch of buttons that are useful here - I can go directly into a 16:9 gameplay scene, a 4:3 scene, a full-screen camera chatting scene, BRB, etc. I also have a button that toggles the camera I'm showing on all of the above scenes at once, so I don't have to think about which one I'm on currently.

Then, when I'm done, hit a button, and it goes to a version of the chatting scene with my socials so I can plug them right at the end, yadda yadda, and a final 'end stream' button that goes to an ending scene, plonks some links into chat, mutes my mic, turns off my lights, and plays music again.

All of the above could also be achieved by manually toggling scenes and sources in OBS, or with a ton of remembered hot keys, or a smaller number of hot keys that pipe into AutoHotKey. It is, arguably, a device of convenience. The Stream Deck just makes doing it a lot easier, it's simpler to iterate with, and I've never had to alt-tab to use the Stream Deck. (I've found that some games when played fullscreen don't let inputs escape their little sandbox.)

I just added a Stream Deck XL to my setup, and I am planning to add some effects. One idea is to fade to greyscale, play 'hello darkness my old friend', and then revert back to normal after a timer. Again, AutoHotKey could do this, or I could have a dedicated button that does it all for me and will work without alt-tabbing."
3282,"If you use slobs you can use their app to turn your phone in a stream deck. It's cute, but nothing more than a gimmick"
3283,"Know you already got lot of replies, but just to summarize its a very advanced and streamlined macro.. deck? basically. 

But, if you ever did want to test it out without dropping $$$, they do have a mobile app (might only be on iOS not 100% sure) that you can subscribe for like $5 a month and try it out."
3284,"basically for convenience, unless im wrong. please correct me if i am, i dont wanna spread misinformation"
3285,I think there’s a valid point that if the person carries on streaming they’re quickly gonna have to replace a lot of kit... I guess the people suggesting it just underestimate the turnover rate of new streamers though
3286,That's been my biggest regret. I spent a little bit of money on a lot of stuff and it added up. Now I have a graveyard in my attic where all my old stream gear is buried. Pro-tip if you're going to buy a green screen get twice the size you think you'll need.
3287,"Odd. The most common advice I read is “whatever you already have is good enough to start.”. Normally the question is posed as “I want a good x to start, what should I get?”, or “what’s good starting gear for a streamer?”. If you ask for advice on what good starting gear is you’ll get the answer, if you ask “do I need x” the answer is “no, whatever you have is fine until you know you want to invest”"
3288,"I guess we see different posts, dunno. But the ""what you have is fine"" responses are definitely the minority when I read the getting started threads."
3289,"I maybe don't read the subreddit enough then :)

But the advice to ""hey I'm about to do my first stream, what gear do I need?"", the answer is: ""a headset, or a microphone+headphones if you want to talk with chat."", don't even NEED a camera."
3290,"I started on a laptop. The laptop webcam was my mic too. It was fine, don't go crazy on the $$$$"
3291,"People think somebody with 100 subs should have the same setup as someone with 100,000 subs or they shouldn't even bother but that person is in no way filling the niche the other person is and are just talking out of their butt. I don't need a Ferrari to get to work when it's in walking distance."
3292,"I get this & agree things should be added over time. The top end pc part may be useful *IF you are streaming pc games. Streaming can be very CPU intensive & may require the use of some GPU as well. If you're trying to play a new pc game at above minimal settings it may not work. Then you're stuck with a used $300 dust collector. 

I no longer stream, but when I did I has gone with the minimal, had a 720p cap card which I regretted a month in because this meant I had to play my games in 720 not 1080. So I upgraded to a HD60 & enjoyed that, but I had a ps4 pro & 4k monitor. While I didn't care about streaming in 4k the cap card wouldn't push 4k through to the display because it wasn't HDMI 2.1."
3293,thats why you do your own research and not just listen to some wannabe on reddit..
3294,"Exactly. I just started streaming a few days ago. Every video, recommendation, discord user has said you need a 3700x. I have a 2600x, and an RTX 2060 and once I figured out my OBS settings. I think it looks pretty good. Now if I could fix the audio......."
3295,Good light is more important tho
3296,So important. No camera even the c920s looks good in darkness
3297,This. Very true.
3298,Yup. No studio lights needed either. Get them house lamps up if that's what you have
3299,I have an Ikea standing houselight I just drag nexto my PC but offscreen that does the job just fine for now 😂
3300,Nice! I use regular table lamps with LED bulbs in them and tissue paper on the top to diffuse the light. Work with what you got!
3301,This for sure. We got some fairly cheap photography lights off amazon and they're amazing. So many people look like they're playing in a cave by candlelight.
3302,"Haha that’s a cool atmosphere though, also I play better when I can’t see my surroundings, I can zone in"
3303,My webcam can’t even handle a bit of light I swear
3304,"Buy once, cry once."
3306,And so I did.
3307,"I got the c270, I bought it because it was so cheap. It's a great webcam for starting out."
73035,Exactly.
3309,I started with the Microsoft whatever 3000 and with good light it was acceptable.  One of the most important thing with a webcam is lighting.  You can make cheaper look better with good lighting
3310,You can get a c920 for 50 dollars multiple times a year when it's on sale.
3311,"Like I said, if you have the  money, go for it. but a $30 difference for people who don't have a lot."
3313,"While I agree with you. I would never spend $10k on a Downhill bike, as my first buy, because I don't know if I'm going to like the sport. So I'll get a cheaper $2k bike, if I like, I buy the 10k in the future.   


I still will get a good $2k bike, not gonna be cheap and get a $800 bike. However I'll not get the high end. 

Of course, it's different when the scale is in the thousands, but it can apply to low end stuff too. the c270 is a $20 cam with really good quality, it's not a $10 webcam, or just a bad cam. So, as you're entering the hobby, it's better not to spend much if you don't have the money."
3315,"Yeah, if you have the money why not. Also for streaming, if you start to make money from it, then you can use the money from the stream to buy good equipment."
3316,"That's not really apples to apples though. In the realm of cameras, the 922 isn't the 10k bike or even the 2k bike. It might not even be the $800 bike lol.

I think we can all agree that the bottom line for a twitch webcam is 720p like the c270 and the top of the line would be some pro-camera with an Elgato cam link running HDMI directly into your computer pushing close to $1000.

The 922 isn't even technically the middle ground when it comes to webcams when you look at it that way. Realistically it's one step up from the bottom. That doesn't mean it's not professional quality, but it's definitely not professional gear.

If we were to take the bike analogy the 2k bike would probably be a GoPro. Then you have the option for 1080p with an insane frame rate."
3317,Ive used the c270 for almost 3 years before upgrading to the c920. That little $20.00 is still a work horse. Used it as my secondary for a few moths after the upgrade before giving it to my brother to use... 730p30 is def plenty starting out on any platform but twitch especially.
3318,"I can really agree, don't buy the most expensive gear if you don't even know if you are going to grow or like streaming, Unless you use a webcam daily (like me and my friend) don't get an expensive one as first one."
3319,Exactly ! The only other reason I would use a webcam is to play D&D with my friends via discord. But then I don't need anything fancy.
3320,But it would be nice if the people on the other side looked like people. My bfs dad plays with a group online and dang they need a better camera. They look like minecraft characters
3321,That is true hahaha
3322,"I dont even stream but honestly if you are just getting your feet in the water work on more important things first. A webcam is not needed, and thus spend less on it. A good quality microphone however is very important."
3323,"I disagree. $70 is not much and you get *such a better* camera. The color *suuuuuuuucks* on the c270.

Lots of people are saying you never go fullscreen. That is wrong, uninteresting streamers never go full screen. Good streamers have tons of different scenes, including full screen for chatting with viewers.

Stream quality is a big part of what attracts follows, shoot high. You don't need a seperate PC with an El Gato and a mirrorless DSLR for a webcam, but seriously don't cheap out on stuff that costs less than a hundred bucks.

Streamers with bad cams and bad mics are a dime a dozen, be better and you'll get attention."
3324,"As a Viewer ..this so much , if I turn into you're stream and you're cam and audio sucks I'm out in 5 seconds."
3325,"What a lot of people don't realise is that you will most likely have your Webcam around 320x240 size most of the time.

Unless you plan to dance on stream an expensive HD Webcam is a complete waste of money.

A Webcam helps you connect with your audience by letting them see your reactions. A cheap one does that just fine."
3326,I used the webcam on my laptop for a long time.
3327,"I did the same when I started out. Definitely not ideal, but I had better engagement with that than if I’d had no camera at all."
3328,If your looking for the best possible picture from a webcam you are better off going cheap on the camera and then spending the extra money on a pair of diffused desk lamps with adjustable power. Most houses are no equiped with enough lights to get a great video even with an expensive camera. 90% of the time you are going to be so small on a 1080p(max) screen that 720 is even overkill.
3329,"Upping your lighting game is way more important than a super fancy camera. If you can improve your lighting, your video quality will also improve. Pretty much all webcams look like crap in low light."
3330,You don’t need a webcam at all I’d say
3331,"everybodys situation is different, work with what you got in your bank and how serious you want to be.

if you make six figures, heck, go get top end stuff, you obviously can afford it.

if you make minimum wage, craigslist what you need."
3332,"When it comes to webcams/cameras, people tend to forget that you'll more than likely NEVER fullscreen the camera. So yeah, once you've scaled down the camera in your stream, the total resolution it can output is not as important. Getting something that'll output like, 5XXp and maybe 60fps (like a PSEye camera) is pretty good for a stream. What IS super important is good, balanced, and intense lighting. If you give a camera enough lighting, the picture will be great. If you give one of those cheap logitech webcams very little light, it will look like shit.

However when it comes to stuff like audio and general PC build for single PC streaming setups, I do think a lot more consideration and investment planning should be done. If you go the USB mic route, you are really limiting yourself to that mic. Your only upgrade path is another USB mic. Where as if you took the time to save up a little more, you could get a really decent USB audio interface which would allow you to open up your horizon to hundreds of XLR mics. 

Single PC streaming setups have become much better in potential output quality due to the better NVENC encoding options on the newer Nvidia cards. Dual PC setups will still net a better looking stream (and truthfully makes your stream less of a pain with everything stream related getting offloaded to another PC) but you can now achieve pretty great results with single PC setups."
3333,Im doing fine with a Ryzen 3600 + RX 580 8gb. I haven't found a single game I can't stream yet.
3334,At what in-game resolution and frame rate? What is the output settings of your stream? What CPU present for encoding? You can always make your stream look better/keep it consistent while improving your own gaming experience which will make you want to stream longer = more potential success.
3335,"Im using my ipad as a camera for my stream—surprisingly looks ok besides the face tracking. I figure I’ll get a real camera down the road if I feel comfortable enough with it.

Edit: I should probably add that I didn’t get the iPad specifically to use as a camera, i used it for art/digital media things and thought it a clever idea to use it as a streaming camera when I have nothing else. Please don’t go and buy an iPad for this purpose."
3336,I got a webcam for 50 cents at a church’s fair and sure its grainy at times but that’s it. It’s great
3337,">And if you decide streaming isn't for you or it just didn't workout for you, you only spent $20 rather than $70.

This is why I always tell people to start cheap. I have seen multiple online friends decide they want to stream, drop hundreds (or in one case thousands) of dollars on equipment, and then give up streaming after a couple months.

Start small! If it goes well, take the money you get from bits/subs/donos and buy new equipment. It's a win-win because your viewers see that their donos are going towards improving the stream, and you're not spending savings on equipment you may only use for a few months or a year."
3338,"Just as a side note, cameras are by no means required for streaming, I've talked to people who have wanted to start streaming and are just not comfortable with their appearance or don't like the idea of people seeing their face. There are plenty of quite popular streamers who have no face cam and do very well (think soviet womble or RT game). Personally, my feeling is if you arent very animated or you don't think your expressions will add anything to the stream, then I wouldn't recommend it as it can get a bit awkward for you and your viewer's id the only thing on your face cam is you staring at a screen.

Just my 2 cents, good luck in your steaming everyone!"
3339,"Honestly there is nothing wrong with spending lots of money starting out if it's something you're really into, as long as you're having fun enjoying yourself you should just do what you enjoy. Sometimes having nicer equipment and webcam can help bring yourself confidence and motivate you to create higher quality, I know when I started off with fitness/going to the gym, I spent a lump sum of money on supliments like bcas creatine and protein, as well as getting myself some nice gym clothes to workout in, and it help give me some confidence and motivate me to continue to go, I'd assume the same would go for streaming."
3340,"Kind of piggybacking on this, but if you really want to invest in something that will make your stream look good, spend the money you save on an expensive camera and invest in lighting.  Get some floor lamps you can point at you, some clip lights, anything that will brighten your face.  The best camera in the world will look like hot garbage without good lighting."
3341,In the UK here but I got the C920 for around the $20 mark on a sale once before I even started streaming
3342,"I've never seen it that low, I've never seen a better price than Amazon and the cheapest it's ever been there is £25 ($33)

https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07QZZS7S1?context=search"
3343,There are actually a shit ton of streamers who still stream without webcam and still be successful. Idk if it’s a necessity but it’s definitely a plus if you have one I guess
3344,"So true, as a number of game streams that I watch don't use webcams."
3345,"> or they rather just spend in other important stuff, like a good Mic, or even save up for a better pc. 

 Don't forget thing like food, rent, etc.... 

 I see people tell others to get these expensive mics and setups in the podcast world when someone says that they are just starting. There is nothing wrong with starting off with inexpensive equipment, as like you said, if streaming or podcasting isn't for you, then you aren't out that much."
3346,"As an avid c270 user, you really don't need anything else for 720p streaming and decent room lighting. We have those fancy 100€+ Logitech cams at work and they're certainly better, but not 80€+ better."
3347,"facts man - go cheap when starting out - because you never know if you are actually going to like it - I had one friend that got affiliate then he was like that's good enough for me, I really don't care for streaming."
3348,"Hey man thanks for this, I already have a really insane pc but I just decided to get into streaming and I was about to drop a lot of money on a webcam cause I figured I needed a good one if I wanted to get any kind of viewers but I just ordered the c270 cause I realized that I’m just starting and I’m doing it for fun so I shouldn’t invest to much money!"
3349,"Exactly. Then if you actuallt enjoy it and people are actually watching you, dropping those $50 or whatever won't be that heavy lmao"
3350,Yup. Plus only spending $20 on a webcam and then $19 a month for stream labs is luckily my only expenses. So as long as I’m enjoying it even if people aren’t watching and it’s just my friends tuning in perfectly ok with that lol
3351,"Disagree. If you’re just testing the waters, don’t bother with a camera. If you decide you like streaming, don’t waste money on a 270 and get a 920/922 later. Just get the 920/922 first and be done with it. It’s still a budget camera, it’s not expensive at all and it can be found on sale often. The quality is also a LOT better than the 270. Not talking about pixels, but colors and the way it handles light are all much better. Besides you can use a webcam for more than just streaming."
3352,This is exactly what I said also if you decided to get rid of it you can sell it back for most of the money on eBay or something.
3353,"I'd argue that buying the *right* first camera is better to do before you spend $20 on a camera you'll end up replacing. It's not like the webcam will be useless if you find that streaming is not for you, plus reselling the *right* camera is easy, whereas nobody wants your secondhand $20 camera.

If I want to start playing the guitar, as an adult, I'm not going to go out and buy a $5000 guitar and amp and pedals, but I'm also not going to start off with the $50 walmart brand I KNOW I'll immediately want to replace.

It's about value. The Logitech C920/930 is *really* great bang for your buck."
3354,"When I started out I had a C270 aswell.
What disturbed me the most was the „Field of View“ because the camera had to be far away from you to get you on screen.
I have a C920 since some months now and I‘m happy. 

But for starting out its okay. :)"
3355,I keep mine far away.. with the wide angle lense the c920 can make your face look wider than it is if it's too close . I just use the zoom feature to get closer in.
3356,"It's worth factoring in that if the person later gets more serious about streaming, a second camera can be useful, so that cheaper webcam won't have been a waste. I'm not even a speedrunner but enjoyed using a controller cam, as it made the the stream feel a little more personal. I even got a third cam down the line for games with pedals."
3357,"FYI. There are many webcams around not being used. I posted on my local Facebook group is someone had one lying around they didn't use. Got one for free that is OK. Colors are a bit off but I turned it over to black/white and its great. Also black/white is a bit different so I stand out some more. I ended up just spending money on a six pack that I gave to the guy I picked it up from.
It's Cheap and I feel better not just buying something but reusing something that others don't need any more."
3358,"I agree with you about 90%. I started with a c270 myself and, yes it was ""good enough"", but now it's a year later and I have 2 c922's and a GoPro that gets used occasionally and the 270 is a $20 paperweight. 

I had the money on the front end for the 922 and wish I had just gone with it from the start, but if you, or whoever, doesn't have the money then the 270 is a great little budget camera. That's assuming you spend the $30 you saved on lighting for it. You could buy a DSLR and it would look like garbage if your lighting isn't right."
3359,I mean you can always buy a used one as well for cheap. I got C920 for 20$ off Facebook and works perfect.
3360,Amazon just did a sale on the C920 for €25 so I bought it. I was using a DSLR + Capture card and flipped backwards for the convenience. Even using Magic Latern the DSLR still auto timed off the live video every 30 minutes. Webcam is plug and play and honestly once you tweak the settings it's not a whole lot different.
3361,"With DSLR you need a dummy battery(assuming your DSLR is common search for the model name of your battery with the words dummy battery and it will popup online)... to bypass the powered on limit.

The only reason to be using DSLR is if money is not an issue or you already owned one, if you want a way higher quality, depth of field and 60fps. If you do not really care about those obviously its way simpler and way cheaper to just be using a webcam - exactly like you said its just plug n play."
3362,"I use a dummy battery in the DSLR for the constant power. It's not a turn off problem, it's seems to be the mirror flipping closed or something like that. 

There's a couple of other reasons I switched to a webcam. I don't have a single set up, but instead go between two different buildings so it's a lot easier to pack up and move a webcam instead of a dslr/capture card/tripod and associated wires. Also limited space in the set up means I can't get the DSLR far enough back to have as wide shot as I would like."
3363,"> I use a dummy battery in the DSLR for the constant power. It's not a turn off problem, it's seems to be the mirror flipping closed or something like that.

That seems really weird, which DSLR camera is that one? Or maybe either the dummy battery is not working correctly or a wrong setting in the camera. Although its not gonna really matter since for your usage it does seem annoying if you kept using the DLSR setup because you have to move around(location buildings) a lot plus the extra setup + space requirements yeah not worth the hassle - this is more of a always left forever there untouched streaming setup :P"
3364,But the c920 mic isnt half bad so if your needing a cheap start and are trying to pick between a mic and a webcam you get both...... Also it won't overheat or fall apart like many cheap knockoffs do.
3365,"As someone who has streamed for about 10 months with a c270, I would agree that it fits needs of a basic webcam. I did switch to a c920 though and will say it makes a HUGE difference. If you are just trying to figure out if you want to be a streamer, sure, the c270 is going to be fine. If you want to be on the same playing field as most other streamers though, you want a c920 or better. A good quality webcam, a good quality microphone, and a good overlay/alerts are all a standard of streaming these days and do not make you stand out. They are a minimum now unless you have something else that makes you really stand out."
3366,"I have both the 270 and a 920 and for the most part they are both very nice cameras.

I noticed the 270 takes a more zoomed in picture than the 920 does when they are side by side on top of the same monitor

I think the 270 is a great starter cam"
3367,I believe starting without is the best way af you’re then doubting you can ask it at your viewers.
3368,I’m just starting and got a c920 used on OfferUp for $20...
3369,"Here is my take on it as someone who is also starting out. You should focus on audio more than a webcam. 

If you can't afford a webcam I would just wait till you can afford a better one that you won't need to think about upgrading later. 

Most streamers are moving to DSLR based facecams. That would be an upgrade path of 3 devices if you want to start at that level. Now you might be able to utilize more than one for different camera angles. 

The way I see it as someone else mentioned if you don't think you will want to get a better quality one and see it as more of a hobby then go for the cheaper one up front. 

If you think you will want to upgrade and won't use a two camera setup, then just wait till you can afford the better one. I streamed a few months without one and focused on audio instead until I could afford and wanted to make the jump to a c920."
3370,My camera is mid range decent at best but gets the job done. I do need more PC parts to stop my games from shitting themselves while I stream however. Can’t even stream R6S
3371,"My rig is so slapped together! I want bore you with the stats but it consists of old computer parts that I either saved from the landfill or someone gave me something when they upgraded their gaming computer. I have a tendency to hoard old tech. I found a Blue Spark Digital mic for half the normal price because it had been returned to Amazon. Only thing wrong is that they threw the wrong mic stand back in the box which I don't use anyway, and the USB port is a little hinky sometimes. I originally for the mic for singing. I just bought a desk mounted spring loaded mic stand for 13 bucks which they actually sent me 2 for the price by the way. I will also be buying some chroma key fabric for 10 bucks soon. Everything else I already had."
3372,Thanks for the insight! That's helpful. Do you wanna share your stream here?
3373,"logitech c615 can be found much mroe readily used than the c270... and for like 5 bucks. I have 3. Get that.

edit: Facecam, roomcam, & VR LIV cam"
3374,"True, I started out with a very very cheap webcam from the 2000’s era, kinda just put together what I had. Over the years I upgraded to the C920, although, i’m not big on streaming, its actually a very professional option used by many studios for video work, including company I work for. If you’re into filmmaking, its the choice of professionals, i’ve used it for a few projects, great quality, but very expensive for a hobby. And a total waste if its going to collect dust"
3375,"That reminds me of the streamer who green screened a gamer chair and used a regular kitchen chair.

Edit: while looking for [this clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/a3sl7m/they_asked_him_what_gaming_chair_he_was_using/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I found out it is a pretty common practice to fake a gaming chair. Go figure."
3376,"I spent in total 100 dollars for my stream setup. Most expensive part was my elgato stream deck that was 60, I bought a logitech webcam and mic for the other 40. If you fool around with the settings, and using a lamp pointed at your face, the image can look super crisp with a cheap webcam. It's not dslr quality but it gets pretty close. I haven't had any complaints about my face cam quality so far from viewers either so it must be passable ☺️!"
3377,"I agree , I kind of pushed off streaming for a couple of years due to personal issues. And the last year and a half I was like okay I need to do this and kind of was in the impression that I needed everything top class and was a bit intimidated. But decided let's just roll the dice and got the logitech c920 when it went on sale over the summer for like $35, doing it on a decent laptop (not a gaming or top end) and was running my mic for stream off the webcam. It was pretty decent once you tweak it and set some filters on it. My biggest purchase was the el gato. And recently just saved up to get a hyperx quadcast mic to try it out since it was $40 off over the weekend."
3378,i wanna start streaming so bad but i have a very bad laptop and i got no games on my ps4 :/ my mic is decent though and i could afford a webcam
3379,"I streamed without webcam until I got enough stream revenue to buy one, just because everyone uses webcams doesn't mean it's necessary. Streaming without one, and at a certain follow goal, do a webcam stream face reveal, and keep it up from there! That's what I did, and it went really well"
3380,"You make this investment sound like you are investing into a job rather than a hobby though.  This entirely depends on the person and what their goal is.  Personally speaking and for a friend of mine who both of us just enjoy quality products feel the need to not go to a lower quality (not saying c920 is shit, but if there's better, I prefer the better) when you have cash to burn.  I'm not out on twitch to grind and get the highest sub count, or viewership or follower.  I mutually invested into my stream to play with friends WHILE streaming just for the hell of it, and if people want to sub or help donate so be it.  It's more fun to see people come in and throw a prime at me every once in a while, twitch is like a mini-game of fun while playing a game.  And also it helped expand a network of friends by sharing my knowledge and helping others with their stream.  I get way too bored with real life shit, this is the best hobby I've picked up in a while.  Keeps me in doors and out of trouble too,  If it weren't for streaming I would be at the bar getting hammered every night and end up with some fucking STD or some shit."
3381,"You are 100% right, that's why one of my first sentences were: ""if you have the money to spend, go for it. But a lot of people don't.""

I personaly, I have extremely limited money I can spend forwards my hobbies (jiu jitsu, gaming, audiophile). So, these $40 I saved up on the webcam, I was able to get a new headphone..."
3382,"Ah yes I skipped over that sentence by accident because i was skimming, but generally speaking yeah I know what you mean, 90% of the twitch population shouldnt spend if you dont have any particular goal or the cash to spend on those parts."
3383,"I started in 2018 on an old refurb dell optiplex i5 from 2012, 3 c270’s (one for face, one for midi controller, one flex cam- guitar headstock mount/doggo cam/guest camera, and an elgato hd60 i found on fb marketplace for 25 bucks. Was fine, no complaints, running an ASUS GL703, Strix Hero Edition, 1 c920 and 2 c270’s now and for screen capture I’m running an ethernet hub and doing it via NDI now"
3384,"I bought a c920 not just for streaming, I also bought a Razer Seiren Microphone not just for streaming.

You can still purchase good gear if you want to, they have more uses than just for streaming, if you're looking to drop some dosh on high end gear but are worried that it'll go to waste on streaming, think about what else they can used for."
3385,"But I never said someone shouldn't buy the c920. I SPECIFICALLY SAID, ""There is no need in spending more than $20 on a webcam if you're starting."" on a TWITCH reddit. So I'm specifically saying that you don't need to buy a c920 if you're starting as a streamer. You could buy it, of course, but there are other options. 



I created this post, because after asking people here, it seemed that the only webcam I could possibly buy for streaming was the c920, when in reallity, the $40 cheaper c270 is good enough."
3386,"I am aware of what you said, but regardless of if you're starting, thinking about starting or are already knee deep in streaming, purchase what you like, because they've got other uses that aren't restricted to just streaming, so if you're thinking of buying a c920 and are thinking about streaming, you should take into account the other uses than just streaming if you go ahead and purchase it, because if you find that streaming isn't your jam, you know you've got a c920 for other uses instead of thinking you've wasted money."
3387,"The only reason I still recommend the c920 is because it regularly goes on sale for half off everywhere, and dollar for dollar, it will retain quality and give a huge bang for your buck.

Buying something cheap and then going to a 920 in a year isn't helpful cuz it's much more expensive to do so long run. Better to just not use a cam save another 20 or 30 bucks and buy the half price 40 or 50 dollar c920.

It's not like you need to save up an extra 100 bucks - it's 20 or 30. You can do that shovelling some driveways or mowing some lawns for a few extra bucks."
3388,"Hey. I got a streaming set of web and mic from trust gtx and costs about $35-$40. A good deal.
I can only stream lol and lor for now and that is enough. Will start streaming in a few days on my new channel, wish me luck!"
3389,"I picked up an ASUS TUF laptop from Best Buy, Ryzen 7 3750H for 650 bucks, they had an even better deal on Black Friday for 550. It runs every AAA title effortlessly. Never had any issues streaming. If you position the lid correctly...you could even us the built in webcam."
3390,Isnt 30fps 720p good enough since it will be in a small square anyways?
3391,"Some equipment I agree, but something as basic as a webcam that can be used just to chat with family or friends I wouldn't encourage going under the baseline C920. (which is like 50 or 60 bucks).

If it doesn't work out for streaming, at least you still have a great 1080p webcam."
3392,"Added note, I got 2 of the 90$ cams on sale for $30 each. Local best buy had a sale.


If you want equipment, be sure to look around your area for deals and sales. Facebook marketplace is also a  great place to find a decent hand-me-down camera."
3393,"Revision: There is no need in having a webcam if you're starting.

You could be uncomfortable, your living conditions could be unsuitable or maybe what you do just doesn't need one. Ect, there's no pressure."
3394,"Speaking of webcams, if you have a laptop even the one built into is good enough to get started with in my experience."
3395,This is amazing advice thank you so much. Also any tips to grow the stream or channel? Not really sure how to grow it I have a couple subs here and there but that's it
3396,"I agree, I bought a $20 cam from Target when I first started. As long as your light source is fine (use a spare phone or your phones flashlight) then you’ll be Gucci"
3397,"I wouldn't say there's ""no need"" really. Most cameras are more expensive because the quality is better. Beyond resolution and frame rate there are lots of features that affect video quality

Obviously don't take out a small business loan to buy a $10,000 camera if you're just starting out and you're not sure if it's for you

However there's SO MUCH competition on twitch. For the most part if someone's camera or mic just looks or sounds like shit most people aren't going to bother giving that streamer a chance. Then instead of growing and having fun they're left wondering why no one wants to watch them stream 

Everyone's experience will vary but I think it's a bad idea to assume the bottom shelf gear will be good enough to grow your channel. Unless you're just the most charming person on the planet of course

If $17 is what you can afford then go for it! I'm not judging you. 

If you CAN afford more though then you'll have a leg up on everyone else's production value. For some people like me that's important as a viewer"
3398,(Used) C920 or any 720p + some proper DIY lighting should do the job great.
3399,I would recommend using that money towards layouts and emotes. At least two emotes ready when you get affiliate. I bought that cam and recently I upgraded a year later.
3400,"I have the C270. If you override the exposure to -5 or -6 in OBS's camera settings and set your own brightness, whitdbalance, and other settings with good lighting, it actually looks like a really good webcam. You'll only really notice the quality reduction if you're streaming higher than 720p and you go for a full cam view scene."
3401,I'm just trying to find a cheap mirrorless for sub 200 on eBay.
3402,"I have my set up sourced from a laptop, and I use my default laptop webcam and honestly, for some shits and giggles, it's not a bad way to 'start'. It's a dream to actually get into streaming, but I'm echoing OP here, starting cheap and small is definitely the way to go, rather than investing in something you may not develop commitment for."
3403,"I mean, there are quality limits... I could spend $20 on a PC that would be better quality than the laptop I own and am using right now (1998 Intel Pentium 2 core 2 thread w/ integrated graphics card), it is poor quality, and growth is hard (or harder) when you can only go to 480p on stream. Internet is a whole other story (mine is garbage so...) It depends on the person to invest some money in equipment or not, me, I need a PC of some form before any other upgrade (I do stream it's just really really bad) so I can see the growth I want because I can do what I want on stream and have it not be 480p."
3404,Would anyone be able to recommend a PC for me then? I want to be able to use my capture card without it dropping frames on stream. I want to be able to stream sword and shield as well as other games from my switch/xbox one. The problem is with my 6 year old laptop it's just constantly dropping frames and is unwatchable. I would like to spend around 800-1000. Is this possible?
3405,"Go to r/buildapcforme and ask there, they'll happily help you out. $1000 is definitely possible to build a full setup. $800 for the pc and $200 for monitor, keyboard and mouse"
3406,"Sometimes I regret buying a nice webcam, a blue yeti and a stand for it when I first started streaming.  I got really into but then it fizzled out. So I sank like 200 right from the start but then didn't stream anymore after a month.


My advice is start cheap. I just now got back into streaming and I still wouldn't go crazy on the gadgets until you are for sure gonna stick to it."
3407,C920 is 40 bucks rn
3408,I followed you too! :)
3409,"Honestly, I'd go even further, you don't need a webcam at all. There is nothing that turns people away from a stream faster than bad audio and everyone would be better off investing in a microphone."
3410,"Its the same as saying you don't need to spend x amount on internet, just stream in 360p, sure you can but majority of users will not watch a low quality stream.

If you can't afford to stream with expensive equipment, there's nothing saying you can't get the minimum and do just fine, but majority of people aren't going to recommend a $20 camera based on the simple fact most people will go with quality vs expense, rather than throwing $20 down the drain for a sub par product, spend the extra and get a product that is known to be fairly priced to today's standards and serves its purpose the best.

With that said, they're getting cheaper by the day and there's nothing stopping you from doing a bit of research and finding there are 720p@60fps cameras out there that cost a lot less than a streamer recommended setup."
3411,get what you pay for.
3412,"This is entirely true. I also would like to claim that you don't need to throw hundreds on an expensive mic. Heck, the mod mics today are even good enough. And also there are more affordable options for mics on the desk/on a stand. Here in Europe, Superlux is a good brand for that stuff. They make copies of brand-name products that are still good quality, just at about half of the price."
3413,Superlux makes the drives that are on akg headphones. Correct me if im wrong
3414,Could very well be. I have some of their headphones and I'd say they're not at all far from the model (usually Sennheisers) they were going for.
3415,If you can't afford to get some decent equipment then IMO you shouldn't be streaming. You should be spending your time on improving your life so you can afford things like that.
3416,Why do you not need more than 720p for twitch? Am I wasting bandwidth by streaming from PS4 at 1080p60fps?
3417,"You could, it just depends. At least for a single pc streaming the performace inpact I'll have isn't worth it. Also if you're not a partner people on mobile will be stuck to 1080p60p which sucks"
3418,"I still have and use a C270- it's fine for a face cam and if you have(had) poorer internet like me it's likely you can only pump out good 720p.  I started streaming with a dual core laptop with AMD graphics just to see if I liked it  (Not games though... when I attempted that for a week or two the computer overheated) and upgraded PCs when things got really moving.

Some of the fastest growing game based content creators I've seen don't even have a webcam.  As long as your voice sounds decent, and your content has enough pixels, it's all about your personality really. 

I would definitely say that you should start doing more than you should be theorising.  A lot of my initial thoughts about streaming changed (and continue to change) as I'm doing it longer and longer."
3419,Agree but also look for used c920s on fb marketplace or OfferUp before you buy a cheaper one. Got my second one for $25
3420,"I agree completely. Im actually using my old iPhone 7 with a webcam app, because I have no idea if my streams will be anything and I dont entirely feel like splurging on tech for it if I dont need to. Plus it outputs 1080p footage if I need it to, so it works for now."
3421,Your internet connection is the only piece of tech you should be concerned about having high end of.
3422,"Also depends on your category. So i kinda disagree. 
If you are a just chatting person or a talkshow/podcast streamer i would recommend spending more then 20 bucks on a webcam."
3424,What if I'm 4 years into streaming? Should I aim for a more specialise/complex setup?
3425,It all depends on you and your community. Are they satisfied ? Do you think they will appreciate the change ? Is it financially viable for you ?
3427,Now with corona you can add a 0 to the $20 lol
3428,"100% agree ... And to add if you keep debating on a webcam or asking ""do I need a webcam to stream"" the answer is No.... When you first start out the most valuable thing is to just stream... It gets you practice and it gives you a way to download your vod to ""create highlight reels or clips"" to post to other platforms to help discoverability"
3429,"I respectfully disagree with you on that. A webcam is a necessity. I know there are streamers that do very well without a camera, but they're the exception not the rule. 

Also, streaming for the sake of streaming won't get you anywhere on twitch. There are a million other small channels pushing out sub-par content and if you do the same you'll be lost in the bottomless pit that is the browse page. Success on twitch in my experience is very much a quality over quantity situation. You can still get in practice streams while pushing quality content if you plan ahead. 

I do agree with the ""creating highlight reels/clips for other platforms"" that is very much a DO THAT, but again you have to be careful to edit it in such a way that it plays out as more of an ""I'm a streamer and I'm entertaining"" video and less of ""hey look at me play this game"" because there are a billion of those videos out there already. Figure out a way to meme it up, zoom in on your face when you do something awesome to show your reaction, add slow motion to the play of the game or sound effects to make it funny. Anything to stand out."
3430,"You missed my statement then completely.... I see countless time people are not streaming just asking reddit for the best graphics/mics/cameras (which is fine) but they are not streaming too while they are just casually playing. Not even just recording. When you are not streaming/recording you are missing Opportunity to create something to put on another network for discoverability. I understand fully the people without webcams are the exception but no one is blowing up overnight when they buy the best webcam... You start by getting out there on another platform and what better way to do that is just start streaming so you can download the vods to make a clip or even just recording all your gameplay.

I'm just using streaming as an example to have your vod somewhere to download to create clips...you could just record strictly your gameplay instead of streaming but if you atleast press the go live button you can practice streaming cause many many many of us will stream to less than 5 people for a long time

Edit: also, if you are worried about missing up your twitch stats by just turning on your stream with no webcam or whatever you can always have a dummy account that you can use so you can go live whenever you are casually playing and not worry about ruing your (main account) and it's branding."
3431,"Apologies if I missed what you were going for. I'll try again.

&#x200B;

>  When you are not streaming/recording you are missing Opportunity to create something to put on another network for discoverability. 

True, but my point was that a quantity over quality strategy rarely works and when it does work it normally doesn't have any staying power.

&#x200B;

> no one is blowing up overnight when they buy the best webcam... 

Of course not, but at the same time no one is blowing up overnight streaming at 480p. Quality is the top priority if you want it to be more than a hobby.

&#x200B;

> You start by getting out there on another platform 

There are a hundred different ways to start. I was an affiliate and paying the internet bill with twitch money loooong before I started using other platforms to push people to my channel. Heck I still don't use other platforms as much as I should. Like I said in the previous post I agree with you that other platforms are important, but there's definitely a right way and a wrong way to do it. Posting unedited VOD's or highlights won't set you apart from the crowd and that's the real goal. If you're no different than the next new streamer on the list there's no reason for people to choose to stick with you. If I'm still misunderstanding I do apologize, not trying to be argumentative."
3432,"I am a BIG believer in the ""only spend Twitch money on Twitch equipment"" mindset.

Currently using my phone as a camera, I've got my old headset with a mic, it's okay. Will probably get the first payout soon so I'll be investing a part of it in the stream equipment, but so far I've only used the stuff that I had before. My lighting is literally an old desk lamp. I have one monitor, and all my games are windowed and occupy like 3/4 of the screen so I can read the chat.

And everything is going just fine.

Don't invest until you're sure it'll pay off."
3433,"Also got a C270 to start and am still using it. Have you figured out how to set the exposure manually? I play at night and the light from my monitor over exposes my face, besides that it works fine"
3434,I have my room lights 24/7 lmao. Ii only turn it off to sleep or when I leave
3435,Yeah I do too they just aren't bright enough to combat the monitor lol
3436,duke above columbia is bold
3437,Brown above Columbia too lmao I think Caltech and Columbia lead the 6-10 without a doubt
3438,I'd say Stanford should be at #2 or at least in Princeton's place.
3440,"US News and WSJ use ""faculty resources"" as a pretty big metric. This disadvantages places like UT Austin and UW Seattle, since they're public schools.

Georgia Tech is a STEM powerhouse, but I presume Case has a more broad focus.

at the end of the day, I think it's fair they're in the same bracket, and I think it's best to not really consider such tiny differences."
3442,"yup. 

Each school has different strengths though, UIUC is T5 for CS/Engineering, GT is T10 for engineering/cs, UT is t10 for engineering CS, business, UW is at that level for cs and life sciences/pre med etc, UCSD incredibly well rounded. 

To me, those are all STEM T25-30's easily, emphatically, beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

And all of them shine in global ranks like AWRU, THE (globals) which measure STEM faculty research prowess. These schools are an incredible opportunity to learn from geniuses for a much lower price."
3443,i liked this post and its reliability so mcuh i gave the wholesome award :)
3444,i like that
3445,"Penn should be above Brown, JHU should be a bit higher, Stanford should be higher than Princeton, Columbia should be #6 or 7

I think you really nailed 15-25 (which is the hardest part). GTech is probably too low"
3446,"Yeah. For Hopkins to move up, someone else needs to move down, and tbh, I don't see who would move down. Maybe NU, Brown or Dartmouth? But imo those are atleast as prestigious as JHU (outside of med/pre med), and I think it's up to the person at that point .

Penn is probably a bit more prestigious than Brown, but I also think Brown has it's own advantages. People picking between Penn and Brown don't need rankings lmao. And, Columbia could also probably be higher, but I think Caltech at 6 is pretty fair, so maybe 7.

If it was up to me, Stanford would be number 1 or 2 lol."
3448,Ya it’s either HYPSM people care about or T20s.
3449,You talk about HYPSM as the T5 but I don't see Stanford anywhere in the rankings?
3450,"Duh. Stanford doesn’t actually exist, remember?"
3451,oh shit. Stanford is number 5. That's why my whole thing fucked up ughhh. Tysm tho
3452,Lmao np
3453,you saw nothing.
3454,"I think these mixed college rankings are misguided. Any ranking will make subjective judgement of what makes a college ""good"". Popular rankings give methodologies from which you can figure out what they value in colleges. If you combine multiple rankings, you lose clarity on what the ranking considers ""good"". It makes it hard (or impossible) to know what it means for a college to be above another college in the ranking. 

If you make a ranking, you should say exactly what metrics go into the ranking. I doubt you can do that here."
3455,Caltech at 6 and brown at 7 make approximately zero sense
3456,Lol Brown at #6 is a bold choice
3457,"funny because I always remembered it at number 7...

^(you saw NOTHING)

And, also to respond to your point, I don't actually think it's unfair. Brown is as or more selective than Penn and peers, offers a arguably better undergraduate experience, and I would say I always saw it as a T10. It's almost definitely a peer to Penn. 

For example, Brown beats Chicago in cross admits by a bit, and loses to Penn and Duke by a bit (i.e. <10% margin) so it's fair to say Brown can compete with this set for undergraduate."
3458,"Building off of your point, I often see Penn being described as more prestigious than Brown (and Dartmouth, for that matter). That’s probably true in some circles, but I’ve always thought differently. 

Brown and Dartmouth are more like liberal arts colleges than they are graduate-level research universities, given their relative sparseness of grad programs and avowed focus on undergrads. This sinks their rankings but shouldn’t diminish their institutional reputations. As an undergrad there, both in allocation of resources and position in the social/cultural fabric of the university, you’re the protagonist. That’s a pretty great position to be in at an Ivy League school.

Meanwhile, Penn is basically a tad-less-prestigious cast of the same mold as Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford (to some extent): undergrad is just one school among a sea of grad programs. Unless you’re at Wharton, there’s no caveat like for Dartmouth and Brown: it’s just not quite as prestigious as some of its peer research universities. Moreover, Penn’s overall reputation is inflated by Wharton (as others in this thread have suggested), and its acceptance rate is deflated by the same (though it’s still less selective in aggregate than Brown)."
3459,Wharton > Brown > UPenn - I say this as a Brown student
3460,"The school I end up at > Wharton > Brown > UPenn 

I say this as a high school senior."
3461,Huh. I've honestly never heard of anyone refer to or think of Brown as a top 10 school.
3462,"Hmm, I always thought of Brown as a T10, but I don't think it really matters. If someone picking between Columbia Penn and Brown wants to use rankings to pick, their loss lol"
3463,"I mean isn't this a ranking too, that you made? lol"
3464,"Yes lol, I meant to say solely rankings. 

I just don't think Brown, Columbia and Penn are different enough in prestige/ranking to use rankings. It's not like you're comparing Columbia and Chico State, where rankings would be helpful. 

And, yea it is a ranking but it would be dumb to use this to pick between Brown, Penn and Columbia too."
3465,"Idk the way I see it in terms of preteige (with no experience whatsoever lmao) is Columbia, UPenn, brown but I think that’s also cause Columbia and UPenn are in bigger cities and because of that just have more opportunities in general"
3466,lmao hopkins aint 14th its got a billion dollar endowment
3467,"yeah but so does every other school from number 1 to 13. You can make some legit arguments for Hopkins to be higher, but it shouldn't be a contest of endowments at that level."
3468,idk man UCLA is too low
3469,"I would put UT Austin and Georgia Tech higher but other than that I agree with this list more than any other ranking list. That being said, I don’t really know a ton about every school so I can’t really say this with certainty."
3470,"UT Austin, GA Tech, Purdue, UIUC, UW Seattle, and UCSD to me are easily T30 for STEM. Their outcomes reflect that too, though. They all place excellently into grad school, UW/UCSD more than the others place excellently into medical school. 

All great, highly similar schools."
3471,"Yeah I agree. Obviously if this were deciding top school for their focal point, schools like UIUC would be close to the top. Which is why giving colleges an overall ranking is tough, as it depends what kind of school you’re looking for."
3473,"Here's the thing--all the rankings could be more accurately replaced with US News' academic reputation ranking. But you have to pay to unlock that/buy the magazine to see it, so instead everyone relies on a weird methodology that doesn't quite work to dream up the prestige of different colleges."
3474,Not me checking to make sure my dreamie isn't on this list because then I won't get in.
3475,Very informative!!!Thanks
3477,"I always saw Brown as more prestigious than Northwestern. 

It offers stronger undergrad education, and is harder to get into, and 65% of people who get into Brown and Northwestern pick Brown."
3478,">It offers stronger undergrad education

That feels pretty subjective, no? And you're comparing a 7% acceptance rate to a 9% acceptance rate. Not to mention acceptance rate is a wack way to measure prestige, generally -- and you say just as much in one of your comments here! There's no consistency lmao"
3479,"True with regard to the harder to get into part, though my comment was just intended to say that ""there's absolutely no way Brown should be in front of Northwestern"" is probably false. 

Brown is famous for offering a objectively strong undergraduate education, especially when compared to other top schools."
3481,i thought its princeton that consistently ranks n1?
3482,"dartmouth has always been number 1 undergrad for like the last 5 years, but slipped a bit a year ago, still is 4th best ivy"
3483,oh cool
3484,"Emory is ranked 21. Everything above Emory is top 20. People don't see NYU as the same because it's ranked 30.  You cannot combine rankings as the methodologies for each one are vastly different. If you combine them you essentially aren't controlling for anything.

( And how would this work if for instance GAtech is 35 on US news and 71 on WSJ...Why is it only 41 then?)"
3485,"After scaling the rankings, I then resorted them. So, my theory of why GA Tech got to 41 is because when I re sorted, I didn't include LAC's.

Without LAC's on WSJ, GA Tech would be around 45-50. So, then this 41 average makes more sense."
3486,I am almost positive you did this incorrectly. If you took out LAC's then Emory would be 21 on both US news and WSJ and a few other irregularities like Columbia and such.
3487,"This one has Forbes, albeit weighted less which slides Emory down. I also did one without Forbes which I didn't post (although I can, I guess), since they don't have a ranking this year, and seem to be less reliable. 

In the one without Forbes, Emory is 20, mainly because though UCLA is higher on US News and CMU is higher on WSJ, both are lower on average."
3488,Ya post that too to give a clearer picture. Forbes is really a messy ranking so a post without Forbes would give a solid picture. Post it if you can
3489,"Sure, I will. Not sure if I should make a separate post lol"
3490,Emory is def T20 what are you on lmao
3491,Yeah seems about right
3492,"Georgetown >> USC/WashU/ND/UCLA though. Outcomes are not even close. Might as well be racing an f1 car @ k1 speeds lmao.

You may have an argument in the context of aggregate research output, but most ppl on r/a2c, if not all, are looking for an undergraduate experience. 

Gtown is easily t15 for undergrad, and my mind is set on that."
3493,How is northeastern not even on that list rippp
3494,"Northeastern was the next one. It did see a pretty big split though. Forbes ranks them very low inexplicably, (well because they use 4 yr grad rate, so i didn't use NEU forbes)

Out of the other, more well known rankings, US News has them at 49, and WSJ/Times has them at 83 (including LAC's). So they miss out by a little."
3495,But I think they are better than Purdue though right? They have a much lower acceptance rate...
3496,"Purdue has an excellent engineering, CS, science, and math program. It's a world class STEM university.

Don't judge a school by it's acceptance rate. Then we'd consider SDSU better than UCSD which isn't true. Purdue has a small in state population, so a high acceptance rate. Purdue is a world class university.

I don't consider Northeastern as good of a school as Purdue since Purdue is a STEM powerhouse."
3497,"I think this is why rankings suck lmao. It’s so subjective, I think the fact that I’m from the northeast makes me see northeastern as much better than Purdue, because frankly I never heard of that school before this sub."
3498,"Purdue? I'm from Nevada, and I'd heard of Purdue a lot, never of Northeastern lol."
3499,lol people here think northeastern is better than northwestern (central pa)
3500,There’s no way just look at exit salary and sat range
3501,Idk man lol my friend got into northwestern and everyone was like “have fun in Boston” “northeastern is such a good school” and he had to be like I’m going to Chicago and northwestern is better it was pretty entertaining ngl
3502,Literally no one thinks that lmao
3503,In my experience a lot at my high school specifically do. I don’t get why people are so pressed
3504,"Well it's sort of like saying ""people think that Lehigh is better than UChicago"" or ""people think that George Washington is better than Yale"" or ""people think that Villanova is better than Cornell"". You're gonna get pushback because it's an inaccurate statement based on most metrics people are looking at. It is just not an opinion held by the vast, vast majority of people."
3505,I’m from the northeast and I don’t think anyone thinks this.
3506,"Well, in my experience, a bunch of people  think this, specifically at my school. It may not be the same where you live."
3507,This is an interesting ranking system. What was your reason for not including the Forbes college ranking list?
3508,"For me the Forbes ranking was not really relevant. First it uses very suspect data, like Payscale and Rate my professors.com etc, which I don't have any faith in. It also favors particular majors, doesn't take into account the fact that the coasts are more expensive to live in etc.
I feel that my outcome will be dependent on my major, where I choose to live, etc. Since I don't plan to major in Engineering which skews the salary data in a big way, I did not want to make my decision based on Forbes's output based ranking. I wanted to focus on input based measures for myself

I am sure for some the Forbes ranking makes more sense. For me it did not. I am focused on attending an academically good university. I don't want to judge that decision on ""what becomes of my peers, once they graduate"""
3509,"Yeah IMO Forbes, although not really considered by most people because of it's ""against the norm"" rankings, is actually one of the more accurate lists out there. Also, OP this ranking is seriously good, it seems to match the overall consensus here a lot more than most rankings. /u/acadranking 

**Edit:** Also, a general question - why are LACs excluded in a lot of rankings like US News?

Ok what did I say something wrong... why is this downvoted lol."
3510,"I could not get enough data on LAC's from the rankings that I used. Only USNews ranked the LACS among the four that I used

See my reasons above for why I did not use the Forbes ranking for myself"
3511,"Wait, Forbes actually officially admits they use that stuff? Are you sure? That's not good at all. Also by ""accurate"" I just meant by my own standards, obviously it's not perfect and a lot of it I definitely don't agree with, but I think it pairs nicely to counteract the US News low rating anomalies."
3512,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2016/07/06/top-colleges-ranking-2016-the-full-methodology/#3ed514f85b82
3513,"They do. Also, since I will be a full pay student, their student debt metric while very important for other students, really doesn't work in my case."
3514,Yeah they did.  The Forbes ranking is pretty useless because of the data they use.  Garbage in - garbage out.
3515,This is a great idea. Someone should make an interactive college ranking where you choose how much to weight different factors.
3516,studentreview.com does just that I think- not sure how accurate it is but it's an interesting tool to play around with
3517,Pomona is for you
3518,Thank you. I do plan to look seriously at LAC's as well!
3519,Where's UT?
3521,Is too low -_-
3523,"Thank you for that suggestion. I have been thinking about the UK universities. I like the fact that it is easier to figure out if you will make it or not, because they are very clear on what they are seeking from an academic standpoint. 

The thing as you suggested though is that they also force you to specialize very early and the system is very different from the US system in terms of a well rounded liberal arts curriculum. 

Besides my Mom is kind of nervous to send me so far away :-) but they are also on the list for now!"
3524,They messed up big-time by not including Grand Canyon University in the Top 10.
3525,😀😀
3526,I can't believe people are forgetting that they are putting tons of funding into their non-ABET accredited engineering programs and their College of Doctoral Studies!
3527,"The list isn’t half bad. It generally follows prestige, no rank seems outlandish (although some people may take issue to public schools being in top 15), and shows you how the establishment and students think of a college.

I’d say every college here fits within a 3 spot radius up or down."
3528,"Maybe in the top-20, but as you go further up there are some schools that seem to be far out of place. BYU at 31? Carnegie Melon at 42 (behind UGA at 41?????) RPI at 95, yet WPI sits at 42 (similar schools, but RPI is no doubt more prestigious). UC Merced ahead of UC Riverside..."
3529,"It's a meta ranking. If several of the sources rank school A ahead of school B and students like going to school A more than school B, then A will be ahead of B. 

I think CMU took a hit because it's student ratings are not stellar."
3531,#15
3532,"I like the ranking gives a good difference, but not too unfamiliar. The top 30 is pretty much the same as US news top 30."
3533,Why tf is BYU so high? It's an objectively terrible place to go to college if you aren't a devout Mormon
3534,Right like attending BYU would be a one way ticket to electroshock therapy or immediate expulsion for a lot of people lmao
3535,Weather
3536,This is actually so important
3537,"hahah yeah, but other than noting factors like that, how else do i learn more about colleges?"
3538,"All schools are the same save two factors, amount of pretty people and weather, and usually better weather means more pretty people, so absolutely nothing matters beside weather."
3539,wait is the hotter weather=hotter people thing true? Makes sense lol
3540,Hot weather = more outdoor activities and less clothes so people are incentivized to get in shape and look more attractive. I guess that’s why Southern Florida and California have some of the best looking people.
3541,Yes!!! UCLA and USC have tons of hot people and LA is pretty hot.
3543,not me basing my college list off of this
3544,bump ^
3545,"For researching colleges, I would recommend finding the differences within the ""basic differences"". like you said most schools can end up sounding really similar so here are some ways I guaged whether I would actually like it there (and depending on who you are, these might be differently prioritized for you):

1. Size: often low student-to-faculty ratio is paraded as this magic number, implying a high level of support but it just measures the number (not how it plays out). I would look into the average class sizes—do you want class sizes to be small and intimate, or do you not mind having large lectures?

2. Undergraduate Support: I think this would be less important for some, but how accessible are opportunities for undergrads? Would you be competing with graduate students? Do you mind mainly being taught by teacher assistants (usually graduates, more likely to occur in a bigger school), or would you prefer to be taught by professors (a staple of a smaller school)?

3. Campus setting!! A lot of people already mentioned weather, but I would also say considering the setting as in whether it's rural, suburban, or urban can play a big part in how much you would enjoy the school. It could also factor in the opportunities available e.g. if you're in a big city, you may have more opportunities BUT are you someone that doesn't really like the hustle and bustle of the city-scene? In more regards to unis, large urban areas can be more isolating OR have a more thriving social scene—in this case you'd have to research how current students would describe it.

4. Campus Culture!! (The vibes - I liked watching YouTube Day in the Life for this one too) This is a huge one in my opinion. This is solely based on your priorities and how you wanna spend the next ~4 years of your life. How many of the students are involved in greek life? Is there big party culture? How are sports prioritized? I think each of these have implications of their own. For instance, Dartmouth has an extremely high student participation rate in greek life compared to other Ivies and that has often been associated with increased rape culture, ""fratty"" culture, and negative implications of forming those social hierarchies. BUT   if you would like a party scene, then it's up to you! 

5. Diversity: this may be just because I grew up abroad, but I prioritized more diverse schools. You can find the diversity statistics of each school if you're interested. 

6. Clubs and strength of the programs you're interested in. Also, simply if they even have the program you want (you'd be surprised how many people apply to schools that don't even have their preferred major)

7. Price and how they expect you to pay or offer financial aid: is it loan-based, do they have merit-based scholarships, do they meet full demonstrated need etc.?

8. Do you want liberal arts education? What kind of curriculum do you like? 

Also, of course you may not know what your exact preferences are yet, but this could be a good start to research universities! Like some others mentioned, Reddit and Quora threads were a nice way to find more genuine opinions!

If you want to find more universities you like, you can
put in parameters you like and explore the results and also find out what the universities you like consider important/not important: https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search

Hope this helps! ^^.^"
3546,"this is really helpful, thanks!"
3547,"Try to get in touch with a current or former student. You can ask alumni that you or your parents/friends know personally, or you can ask around on the college's individual subreddit. 

I've also seen on a few college websites the option to speak 1-on-1 with current students, as well as your regional admissions officer."
3548,"thanks for the suggestions, i’ll be sure to do some of those!"
3549,"things you want! 

when I was researching colleges my list comprised mostly of the best programs for my major then location. 

after I was accepted, since I already knew that each of them had amazing programs for my major I started looking into things I wanted. I wanted a cityish environment, close proximity to a chipotle, maybe a target too, has club lacrosse, study abroad options, outside opportunities for undergrad in the area. 

I did these after I was accepted into my schools to narrow down where to go but you could definitely do this with your current college research"
3550,woww i'm not picky enough for that lol
3551,"same lmaooo i was like eh so-and-so store would be nice, but I can always adjust lol"
3552,"use Reddit threads! I usually searched things like “pros and cons of XXX university reddit” and “premed bio major at XXX university reddit”. and ofc you can branch out your searches however you’d like, if you’re wondering about clubs/programs/sports/greek life/etc

I usually add reddit afterwards so only reddit threads pop up - there’s tonnnns of different threads full of input from current students and such, it’s very helpful to get a sense of the school!"
3553,"oh facts that does seem like a really good idea, thanks for suggesting it :)"
3554,the net price calculator- #1 most important thing imo
3556,"[http://commondatasets.com/](http://commondatasets.com/)

Note: only good for T30s and nothing about vibes or student life, just what you can find in the common data set"
3557,Talk to students that go there!!
3558,Try to talk to students that go to schools and ask them what their average classmate is like and what a weekday and weekend is like for them. This can be tricky to do for a ton of schools but if you try to do it for a few it’s very helpful. At the end of the day it’s about how life is lived on campus and nothing else
3559,maybe try to look into fly-in programs? ik most of them are closed rn but some are open! my mentor really stresses the importance of “fit” so yes check them out 🤪free vacation too. and there are programs like Reed Junior Scholars and Dartmouth Bound that give insights to their schools and the application process.
3560,ooh good idea! are fly ins limited to urms and fgli or can anyone apply?
3561,"for the ones i’ve looked at yea they are limited to urms and fgil students :,("
3562,ahh ok i’m not a urm/fgli but thanks for the suggestion regardless :)
3563,The Reed one is open to everyone!
3564,Read about their mission and goals.
3565,"Follow them on social media. If you want even create a special anonymous account for it, most schools have at least a minimal presence on instagram and plenty have a lot of accounts to follow, everything from dining, career services, activities planning, sports, and clubs. After a while you can start to get a feel for the campus vibe!"
3566,"The best thing I did was get the Fiske Guide to Colleges. It gives an unbiased overview of a bunch of college, and helps you get a sense of what things you’d like in a school (ex: Greek life, campus housing, male to female ration, undergrad size, etc)."
3567,"1. do the colors look good on you? 

2. is the mascot scary? (im looking at you purdue boilermaker)

Anyone you can talk to that will be honest is a good source. Tours are really helpful or suck depending on what guide you get. Talk to someone you know going there if you can. Virtual student panels hosted by a specific group are good (ex engineering department, a sports team)"
