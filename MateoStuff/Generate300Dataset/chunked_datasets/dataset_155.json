52461,"MY favourtites are:

My beautifud Dark Twisted Fantasy

Get Rich or Die Tryin

To Pimp a Butterfly

illmatic

Straight Outta Compton

College Dropout

All Eyez on Me

&#x200B;

But if i had to say only one, i Would say Get Rich or Die Tryin."
52462,I didn't really like to pimp a butterfly despite high praise
52463,Madvillainy - MF DOOM
52464,"Not necessarily the all time best, but some great ones which haven’t been said:
* Moment of Truth- Gang Starr
* Ironman- Ghostface Killah
* The Diary- Scarface
* Wu-Tang Forever- Wu-Tang Clan
* OB4CL- Raekwon
* Liquid Swords -GZA
* Blackout- Method Man and Redman"
52465,Obc4l will for ever go down as the best Wu album ever
52466,4eva Is A Mighty Long Time
52467,Definitely not the best but I'm SOOOO happy to see you mention it
52468,For me it's Illmatic. Close 2nd would be Moment of Truth. At this point Gang Starr had reached a level close to perfection. Even the featurings are one point on this one.
52469,Gang starr had like 4 classics in a row. Guru always delievers and DJ premiers production is on point
52470,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
52471,This album mad.... But Graduation is my favorite ... Kanye arguably dropped what like 5 classics in a row
52472,Graduation is definitely one of his best with College Dropout coming in with a close second.
52473,Facts bro.. for me Kanye has 2 albums that represent what the culture of the world was... Which was Graduation in 2007 and MBDTF in 2010...
52474,Gotta listen to College Dropout first though.
52475,"Not the biggest Pac Fan but I'd say All eyes on Me or Nas Illmatic as the best hip hop album (unbias)

My personal favorites is Big Pun Capital Punishment or Jay Z reasonable doubt

A wild card Brotha Lynch Season of the Sickness or 3 6 mafia Chapter 2: World domination

Another random is Jaren Benton - My grandma's basement

I know you said all time but just thought I'd throw some out there"
52476,Hieroglyphics-Third Eye Vision
52477,93 til infinity vs Third Eye Vision? Great pick btw
52478,I like 3rd eye more but they’re both dope albums. 3rd eye just hits me right. Will always be my fav.
52479,"Mine is Midnight Marauders (in general). I have lot's of love for Hieroglyphics/Souls of Mischief/Del tha Funky Homosapien though (The Pharcyde is great too).

Back to the topic: I pick 93 til infinity it was the first album I heard by Hiero/Souls and it just stuck with me. I personally enjoy Full circle more then 3rd eye vision (will listen to 3rd eye tonight though)."
52480,"Midnight Marauders by Tribe it surpassed a classic, namely Low End Theory and started a second rap renaissance."
52481,I know for a fact a lot of you ain't never listen to illmatic just based on your replies.
52482,Death Certificate.
52483,"I have a few:

Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 chambers
 
Get Rich or Die Tryin
 
Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous
 
Marshall Mathers LP
  
The Infamous"
52484,GRODT
52485,"Aesop Rock— The Impossible Kid.

The Roots— How I Got Over.

Kendrick— Good Kid Maad City

Lupe Fiasco— Tetsuo and Youth

Rapsody— Eve

Little Simz— Grey Area

Earl Sweatshirt— Doris

Madvillain— Madvillainy


Dave— Psychodrama


Freddie Gibbs & Alchemist— Alfredo


Mick Jenkins— The Circus


Earthgang— Royalty.."
52486,"I'm gonna get hate, but Kristoff Krane's Kairos is so damn unique I'd find it hard not to be in my top 5.  Same with Kill The Vulture with Carnelian, as a fan of jazzy hiphop that's so damn good. 

Nas Illmatic is probably the choice that wins out but I think I prefer It Was Written.  But both are damn good."
52487,Diplomatic Immunity.
52488,"Ready To Die. That’s it, That’s all"
52489,"Get rich or die trying, it’s probably not the best, but it’s still so good"
52490,"Get Rich or Die Tryin,Low End Theory, Midnight Marauders, Thank you 4 Your Service, Capital Punishment, Ready To Die. Life After Death, Enta Da Stage. When Disaster Strikes, 3 ft High and Rising, De La Soul is Dead, and the Anonymous Nobody, Paid in Full, Moment Of Truth, The Black Album,The College Dropout,Late Registration,Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Operation Doomsday, Madvillainy,The Infamous Mobb Deep, Black on Both Sides, Black Star,Illmatic,Stress - The Extinction Agenda,OB4CL,Soundombing Vol.2,Train of Thought, Raising Hell,Doggstyle,Illadelph Halflife,Things Fall Apart, Me against the world ,36 Chambers,Wu-Tang Forever,

Would almost throw Blue Chips and Blue Chips2 Just cuz I dig Bronson so much (and I know they are mixtapes not albums). Almost was gonna say Mr. Wonderful just for Easy Rider Alone lol.  B4 Da $$ was a solid album. This will def piss off some people, but I respect Kendrick's lyricism but can't get myself to like TPAB as much as everyone else does. I just don't feel the music. I listen to  Good Kid, MAAD City more. But I don't argue too much with new headz who put him up there because he is the man doin it now.  

When I listen to people who shit on Illmatic I just immediately think it's people who are trying too hard to pretend they have a new take on what's Hip Hop. It was a solid album. Not one weak song. Music really is subjective but there only may be a handful of albums that truly do not have a weak song. This one is one of them. Get over it. Or don't...whatever."
52491,Get Rich Or Die Tryin’
52492,All Eyez On Me-2Pac and Paid In Full-Eric B & Rakim are good to start with.
52493,Talib Kweli and Mos Def - Blackstarr is the greatest album of all time.
52494,Mista Don't Play
52495,Damn thats a lot of listening.
52496,Better Off Dead- Flatbush Zombies takes the cake for me
52497,"To pimp a butterfly, illmatic, straight outta compton and Ready to die."
52498,36 chambers -wu tang
52499,"good kid, m.A.A.d city by Kendrick Lamar is my favorite album of all time. It’s unique, the production is fantastic, Kendrick raps his ass off, and it tells a fantastic story. I’d highly recommend it"
52500,"Here’s my Top 10 (plsss don’t judge)


Chance the Rapper - The Big Day

Eminem - Revival

Lil Dicky - Professional Rapper

Lil Wayne - Rebirth

Lil Xan - Total Xanarchy

Logic - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind

Nav - Bad Habits

XXXTENTACION - Bad Vibes Forever

Hopsin - No Shame 

Corey Feldman - Angelic 2 The Core"
52501,I judged
52502,Somebody roast the crocs off this man quick!
52504,/s ?
52505,"I feel like anybody who was serious enough about listening to hip hop, that they spent time on a dedicated subreddit, would never list any of the above albums."
52506,Lol this reminds me of one of those troll comments on  the CDTV Productions Youtube
52507,Every Lil B album.
52508,Faceplant by Winston https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mHbDP3aN4HFoORQailFgo2rCNVbRLVpmw
52509,"I honestly don't listen to much rap, but I've tried listened to parts of some of the albums listed above, and they really don't sound like they compare. The Money Store is definitely the best hip album I've ever heard."
52510,"Big Luda fan, Word of Mouf is that shit."
52511,"Illmatic, madvillainy, the money store"
52512,"For me, it's Madvillainy

Everything about this album is beyond cool, from the actual content to the story behind it.

I love how Madlib seamlessly ""spends"" lots of awesome beats for skits and short tracks, any other beatmaker would stretch each one for 3-4 minutes. His beats, man, they just come out of nowhere and in a minute or so disappear completely leaving you struck. And Doom is a perfect company for this type of musical thinking."
52513,All caps when you spell the mans name!
52514,"I've heard this track literally hundreds of times, and the sample still hits me right in the bone marrow. Fucking flawless execution."
52515,"Madman never go 'pop' like snot bubbles. 

HE MADE A POPPING SOUND WITH HIS MOUTH AS PART OF HIS RHYME. EVERY TIME I LOSE MY SHIT OVER IT. 

Like fuck off DOOM. Be less talented."
52516,"Yeah, I fucking love it when DOOM does those ""sound effects"" in his tracks."
52517,"DOOM is my SHIT. as soon as I heard him on Demon Days I knew I was hooked. Rap Snitch Knishes has to be one of my favourite light hearted tracks, and I looove that guitar."
52518,I love Viktor Vaughn:The Vaudeville Villian
52519,"""Bitch niggahs talk behind your back like a catcher
Either MYOB or BYO stretcher""

Love that album, dooms rhymes give me ice cream headaches."
52520,Holy shit are you me?! Those two songs were the first I heard by DOOM and now he's one of my favorite rappers.
52521,the albums just got more soul than a sock with a hole
52522,Mos Def - Black on Both Sides
52523,'Mathematics' is forever on my playlist!!
52524,Ms. Fat Booty anyone?
52525,I got ta haAave it!
52526,Wrote my thesis about that song and some others. Best paper I ever wrote
52527,"Umi Says, Whitehouse approved.  

Edit: changed to past tense."
52528,The Ecstatic too.
52529,"May I suggest some golden age stuff? These are some of my favorites,

Mobb Deep - The Infamous 

De La Soul - 3 feet high and rising"
52530,You're the only person i've seen mention The Infamous. Truly scandalous.
52531,"I just love the tone of the album. I wish more hip hop was like that, dark, brooding, ominous, a bit atmospheric, but doesn't overtake the rapping either"
52532,"The Low End Theory- A Tribe Called Quest
Things Fall Apart- The Roots"
52533,"ATCQ - Low End Theory

-

ATCQ - Midnight Marauders

-

Clipse - Lord Willin'

52534,no Paul's Boutique?
52535,"That is what I was thinking.

Paul's Boutique > Ill communication"
52536,The lack of the roots in this thread is borderline criminal
52537,"Things Fall Apart and How I Got Over are the only albums I think are a front to back masterpiece, but they are definitely among the best ever."
52538,I'm a big time Roots fan but How I Got Over was kind of underwhelming I thought. Illadelph Halflife is my favorite of theirs.
52539,The roots and thought get slept on all the time IMO. He's one of the most overlooked M.C.'s ever.
52540,Liquid Swords is IMO the greatest hip hop album of all time.
52542,Gang Starr - Moment Of Truth
52543,Came to post this. Perfect album.
52544,To this day it's my favorite album of all time
52545,They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do...
52546,*Moment of Truth* and *The Ownerz* are severely overlooked albums.
52547,lol daily operation and step in the arena are their best tho
52548,Illmatic - Nas
52549,"If you like hip hop, you need to listen to this album. I mean, it's known as The Bible."
52550,"I consider Illmatic the definitive NYC hip hop album, especially considering it was released during a time period when West Coast hip hop (Dre, 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, etc) was largely dominating the mainstream's attention."
52551,"Notorious, Wu-tang, Mobb Deep, Gang Starr, Redman, Big L, A Tribe Called Quest, The Roots were all releasing classic albums around this time. They're not all NYC, but East Coast."
52552,"It was a great time in hip hop.

I'll throw in my support for Nas' next album 'It Was Written'.
Some think the beats are too 'pop', but Nas was more confident in this album.  Some real classics on there."
52553,"""Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the bible"""
52554,"Now what you're bout to hears a tale of glory and sin

No ID my mentor now let the story begin"
52555,"Piggybacking on this comment to mention ""God's Son"" by Nas.

That record is a masterpiece imo."
52556,"""It was written"" is also very underrated, I think it's one of his best..."
52557,"Jeru the Damaja - ""Wrath of the Math"" (prod. by DJ Premier) 1996


One of my favorite seldom mentioned albums. You'll find many of what are considered ""masterpiece"" rap albums released in the mid to late 90's."
52559,"Somehow when I was younger, I stupidly thought Cannibal Ox was one dude and that he had passed away. 

Just this week, I learned that I was thinking of Camu Tao and that Cannibal Ox released a killer new album in March. Thanks, spotify!"
52560,When did the world catch up to it exactly?...
52561,Paul's Boutique and Fear of a Black Planet
52562,The Score by the Fugees
52563,Don't know why nobody has mentioned this yet... your list would be wrong without it!
52564,"This album imo defines ""front to back"" masterpiece.  Every song is interconnected with the theme and the crossreferences of lyrics among tracks is pure genius."
52565,How is this not all over this thread?
52566,"It's the most slept on classic in my experience. It rarely comes up in discussions like this, but still a classic. Lauryn Hill was crazy talented back in those days. Her verse on The Score..."
52567,Danger Doom - Mf Doom and Danger Mouse
52568,"Notorious BIG- Ready to Die

2Pac- Makaveli/ All Eyez on Me

Jay-Z-Vol.3/ Blueprint

52569,Not seeing much love for Clipse!  Hell hath no fury is still a constant for me.  Brrrapbrap kakakakat!
52570,Daylight EP and not Labor Days? Labor days just always seemed more complete to me.
52572,"Cunninlynguists - Will Rap For Food

52576,A Piece Of Strange is amazing and imo miles ahead of Will Rap For Food.
52578,"You stole my thunder, hahaha.  I'd have to add Dr. Octagonecologyst to this list, as well."
52579,"Dan the Automator doesn't get enough credit.

52587,"Gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick

For those who don't like it, eat a dick

But for those who with me, sing that shit

Cause it go a little something like this"
52588,This was one of my first CD's.  An absolute iconic rap album.
52589,Mos Def and Talib Kweli are Blackstarr
52590,"SCARFACE - THE DIARY

UGK - RIDIN' DIRTY

OUTKAST - PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING OUTSIDE OF IDLEWILD"
52591,"Was about to post Ridin' Dirty, seems like UGK is often overlooked"
52592,"Check out Big L. 90's rapper who is hard as fuck. Great flow, great lyricism. RIP."
52593,"Mad hoes ask beevis I get nothin butthead

Still my favorite line in hip hop ever"
52594,He cooks the mic like a beef steak cuz his techique's great.
52595,"Came here looking for this. He was an incredible rapper, waaaaay ahead of the game. I don't really even like listening to rap all that much, but his work was fucking flawless!"
52596,"So ahead of his time, his parents hadn't even met yet."
52597,"""I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet"""
52598,In da graveyard
52599,"Pretty much  the usual suspects and I'm probably forgetting a good chunk but off the top of my head

Raekwon - Only Built 4 Cuban Linx  
Ghostface Kiliah - Supreme Clientele  
Madvillain -  Madvillainy

52600,"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is so underrated outside of hip hop culture.

Edit: I don't know how I missed Paul's Boutique... Super Duper Classic there."
52609,"Haven't seen these so I'll add: 
Public Enemy - Fear of a Black Planet; 
RUN DMC - Raising Hell; 
Notorious B.I.G. - Life After Death; 
Hieroglyphics - 3rd Eye Vision; 
Cypress Hill - Black Sunday; 
Digital Underground - Sex Packets;"

52613,Madvillainy - Madvillain
52615,Section .80 is so solid as well
52616,TPAB is also a Masterpeice
52617,"It sucks to have to see this down so far, people mostly don't like it because its not an album you listen to at parties, but the sheer artistry that went into that album just amazes me when I listen to it. To Pimp A Butterfly is an artistic masterpiece"
52618,I love TPAB. The composition of the album is just absolutely stellar.
52619,"""I gotta bone to pick...""

in the spirit of the recent thread about lines of a song getting them stuck in your head, this is one that does it for me."

52636,"I'd add ""liquid swords"" too"

52638,Pauls Botique
52639,I personally felt The Low End Theory was better; but Midnight Marauders was awesome.  Good list

52649,Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury is easily one of the most underrated rap albums of all time.
52650,"Upvoted for Vince. 

I can't stop listening"
52651,Cilvia Demo and The Water[s] are so underrated imo..

52665,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Say what you want about Kanye as a person but he is a master of his craft.
52666,Exactly. I always hear about how everybody hates Kanye West. But after I listened to this album I can't takes these people serious anymore. This album proves that he is a real picasso of hip-hop.
52668,"Masters Of The Universe by Binary Star is absolutely outstanding, and has an interesting backstory on how it came about.

Delinquent Habits by Delinquent Habits is one that I can listen from start to finish and there isn't a track I'd skip.

As mentioned a few times, ATLiens by Outkast is amazing and probably my most listened to album.

And it's more of an EP than an album, but Die Laughing by Hyenas In The Desert is great."
52669,I came here to endorse Binary Star album.
52670,Masters Of The Universe is completely brilliant and one of my all time favorite albums.
52672,How did I just now realize that MM FOOD is an anagram of MF DOOM??

Heltah Skeltah - Nocturnal
Lootpack- Sound Pieces: Da Antidote
Random Axe - Random Axe
Sean Price - Monkey Barz (and all of his other albums pretty much)

52678,Atmosphere- when life hands you lemons paint that shit gold
52680,All of Eyedeas albums are gold too.
52681,Found the Minnesotan!
52682,"Eyedeas albums are better than gold, they're magic. The fact that he doesn't get more exposure really makes me question people's judgement. Seriously. The production, the lyricism, the fact that he's deep without going pretentious.. He was a genius."
52683,Yes!!! I'm so happy someone mentioned Eyedea!

52714,Surprised by no Madvillainy
52715,"don't get me wrong, madvillainy is great but i would not put that in my GOAT list

edit: i mean madvillainy's even in my name, but that's because it introduced me to DOOM"
52716,"Vaudeville villain is my personal fave from Doom, beats on that 1 knock"
52717,"ye VV:2 was a little lackluster but there were some great tracks on it, R.a.p. G.a.m.e. is one of my favorite tracks"
52718,For sure dude has some hidden gems. Are you into the older kmd stuff ?
52719,"yep i loooooove the entirety of Black Bastards and some joints on Mr hood like; humrush, who me and peachfuzz are amazing too!"
52720,I see we have a fellow DOOM fan 👍
52721,"yup, love his work so much"
52722,"Honestly, if you're not a DOOM fan, you're not an actual person."
52723,"Haha I’m strangely on board with your list. I don’t know about having Big Daddy Kane’s record all the way up there but yeah. I would swap out for Midnight Marauders probably. 

And all you have is New York! I would tend to throw Aquemini in there. Also at this point I have to say Good Kid Maad City."
52724,"Hahah yep no hate on anywhere else though I'm pretty sure I've made it clear of what my taste is a few mentions for outside of New York
Dre- The chronic
Snoop- Doggystyle 
Geto boys- We Can't Be Stopped
Saafir- Boxcar Sessions"
52725,"I’m happy to see doggystyle up there 

People forget how nice snoop was back then. Also probably he best collection of Dre’s beats in my opinion. It’s front to back dope and also in someways kinda cinematic, like a G Funk Cuban Linx"
52726,Wu Tang - Enter the Wu Tang 36 Chambers
52727,That's in by default!!
52728,Outkast - Aquemini. It's fucking timeless.
52729,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned To Pimp a Butterfly and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. No one in Hip-Hop so far has attempted to create albums which are more artistically ambitious than these two.

But then again I'm 2010s head so there's definitely bias in my picks. Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, Madvillainy are very strong contenders as well."
52730,"There’s a ton of hip-hop albums I’d say are as (or more) artistically ambitious as TPAB and MBDTF. Aquemini, Deltron 3030, Blowout Comb, Undun, Black Up, So It Goes, Veteran, most Flying Lotus albums, most Death Grips albums, most El-P albums, most MF DOOM albums, etc."
52731,"Nicee man like the different opinions, not arguing at all i love talking hip hop so when you say those two are more artistically ambitious then anything before what about them makes you say that?"
52732,Have you heard TPAB?
52733,GKMC was his best album in my opinion
52734,Yeah man im pretty hybrid with New-School & Old... but i like to put Albums that are True Classic first. In about 5 years MBDTF and TPAB will formerly be recognised as classic material (to me at least)
52735,All Eyez on Me - Tupac
52736,I think you misspelled Me Against The World?
52737,"Great album for sure but, All Eyez had such a bigger impact for me. It took over my entire high school and owned two years of hip hop for me. 

That just made me feel old."
52738,"I feel you, all personal preference."
52739,Good call 👍

52747,"~~Jay Electronica - Act II: Patents Of Nobility (The Turn)~~

Mobb Deep - Hell On Earth"
52748,"For what it meant at the time, and how differently sonically it was, both ATLiens and Aquemini need to be considered for a top 10 list.  ATLiens specifically shifted attention of the culture to the south in a way that just didn't exist beforehand.  

When we're talking about a GOAT album, I think that impact on the culture is as important a deciding factor as the quality of the album is. There are a lot of subjectively outstanding albums from a musical standpoint, but far fewer that were cultural landmarks. ATLiens shifted hip hop culture away from the binary east coast/west coast focus that has previously existed and deserves consideration for GOAT imo.  This is coming from someone who on reflex says ""Illmatic"" and has for a few decades as well, but some relistens and rethinks on this topic recently has shifted my opinion somewhat."
52749,"My list always changes but here are the most consistent I could think on top of my head in no particular order.

- Nas - Illmatic
- Madvillain - Madvillainy
- Quasimoto - The Unseen
- J Dilla - Donuts
- Ghostface Killah - Iron Man"
52750,"All of the best albums came out over 15-20 years ago?
Y’all are delusional. 
This would have been accurate if you asked in 2003, but this is absolutely wrong."
52751,I actually kind of agree- what about TPAB or GKMC or MBDTF
52752,Welll what should be in here then? It does say of all time? Maybe madvillain or non phixion future is now for me other then that not much I'd put up with the older stuff
52753,"Opinions are subjective. I’m not saying any one album is missing. 
I’m saying all of the answers on here are “old head” answers from back in the day. These are answers people use to try to sound like a hip hop head. 

You can’t honestly tell me nothing in the 2005-present shouldn’t  go on here. 
With the amount of incredible artists and albums we’ve had, sometimes Cuban Linx gets knocked off the list. (No disrespect to a great album)"
52754,"Like you said opinions are subjective and for me the older stuff is my favourite/what I listen too so therefore it's going to pop up onto my opinion of the best albums. And dude I'm not saying ANYTHING from ANYTIME shouldn't be on here lets discuss what are some of the releases from the last decade or so that you feel should earn a place. My answers reflect my taste as a fan, I don't need to try and pretend to know anything, I'm a fan of the culture that's number 1. 
So what's your thoughts on best of all time man?"
52755,"I can’t imagine not putting a Kanye album on the list. Despite whatever political bullshit is going on and the boycotting, hip hop has been evolving rapidly and Kanye has constantly made incredible albums through the times. As much as I love “Ye”, I’m not gonna say that a project that’s been out is a classic, but MBDTF would easily be on there. 

Run The Jewels would have to have an album on here for me. I would struggle between 2 or 3. 

Get Rich or Die Tryin was a major curve in hip hop. That was the first true gangster rap since the 90’s 


I could go on, but you get the point. 
I don’t doubt your authenticity, I just doubt that everyone in this thread believes the answers they’re giving."
52756,"Agreed that Kanye should be on the list. Probably MBDTF, but maybe Graduation or Late Registration.

I love RTJ, and had as much fun at one of their shows last year as I've ever had at a concert, but I don't think any of their albums are among the best in the history of the genre.

GRODT was massive--I was DJing weddings when that album came out and it felt like ""In Da Club"" was the only song I played for a summer--but I don't think of that as a greatest album of all time.

The only other albums from the past ten to twenty years that are clearly in contention for the list, for me, are maybe GKMC or TPAB.  I'm a big fan of 4eva is Mighty Long Time, and that could maybe make my list. But it's tough for something that's only been out a few years, where the impact on the genre is hard to measure, to compete with something like Illmatic or Liquid Swords or Stankonia."
52757,"Very solid points you have made there mate like the way you have backed them up. And I can see what you mean. I suppose when your talking BEST albums the era argument will come into play most of the time, me personally also havent given enough time to new(er) hip hop, so I will cop that one on the chin as a fan."
52758,"36 Chambers, Liquid Swordz, Deltron 3030, The Cold Vein and Madvillainy."
52759,Have to mention Ghostface - Iron man
52760,Paul's Boutique
52761,"Some people are posting scrub albums, and not a single one of yall even mentioned Black Star. Like wtf."
52762,"My 2 faves are Illmatic and TPAB lol but everyone says tho so if you want something different id Say Rodeo by Travis Scott and The Money Store by deatb Grips.College Dropout is amazing, so Is Madvillainly, Kids See Ghosts, 36 chambers, Low End Theory etc."
52763,To Pimp a Butterfly. No doubt.

52766,DOOM is hard one to choose from... Most of his work under any moniker is an 8-10. He may have one of the best body's of work.
52767,In terms of not having dropped a bad album I'd have to agree. GFK and Keith notable too but in my opinion have some weaker releases
52768,And I just have to shout out Digable Planets. Only two albums and they are both the definition of timeless.
52769,"Then I shall have to say Scientifik aswell (r.i.p)   
Criminal is THE most underrated hip hop album ever for me"
