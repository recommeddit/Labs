56619,"In your situation, I would personally buy a second similar sized screen, and make it my new gaming screen. The Dell S2417DG is a similar size, with good color attributes for a TN panel.

2 reasons being: It's a similar size so will look good sitting next to each other on the desk, and you can retire your first monitor as a video/movie/twitch/reddit watching device for your downtime between matches.

If you're looking for a 1 for 1 swap of your current panel, then that choice is up to you how much it's worth.

I'll tell you that sitting on my desk I have: 1x 75hz, 1080p ultrawide, ips. 1x 60hz 1440p, ips. 1x 165hz, 1440p, tn panel, g-sync (the dell S2417DG).

Based on the fact of the budget you're probably looking at (since you're still rocking the gtx 580), I would say you wouldn't be disappointed with the D2716DG if that's the route you've been thinking of."
56620,"budget isn't the problem, although the ultrawide is pretty much at my personal limit. It would have to be worth it though and I don't have a good way of testing it without taking the risk of just ordering one and sending it back if I don't like it. I'd like to avoid that though.



Graphics card will be upgraded with the monitor or earlier.


The S2716DG and PG279Q have pretty much the same specs, except the panel type. I'm not used to IPS panels so maybe I really should take advantage of that and go with the cheaper TN monitor :D    


I'm not cheaping out on 144Hz, 1440p and Gsync, so maybe I'll still regret not going with the IPS as well..."
56621,"I'll tell you this to consider when upgrading...basically anything.

Your wallet will always thank you for not getting the bells and whistles that you aren't used to and don't truly need. I'll give you an example: A backup camera on a vehicle. At first glance this doesn't seem like that big a deal, been backing up your entire life without one, never had an issue. The moment you get one though, every car from here on out that you buy...you will want that backup camera.

Stick with the TN. Some claim this and that over TN by IPS, but I have both. With a decent tn panel, it's not as big of a difference as most say it is.

Ps, the whole upgrading thing is true about all parts to a monitor though. You'll always want g-sync and always want 1440p now. Limit your own future 'must-haves'"
56622,"I’m same spot as you but currently have a 1080p 144hz. Looking at the same monitors too. 

First off, get the Acer version of that ASUS monitor if you do. It’s the XB271 or something. Same panel but a lot of people say better QC. 

I’d recommend either IPS unless budget is a big constraint. Honestly I don’t know if I’d care IPS vs TN, but if I got the TN I’d always wonder how much IPS would be better. You’ll be looking at it every single time you use your PC so get one you love. I’m considering the UW because 120hz vs 144hz isn’t enough for me to care, and it’ll give me extra screen space for coding/school work. If you’re just gaming, then it’s up to you if $300 extra is worth it for the UW 

Also a store near me has RL on the Acer 1440p IPS UW and it looks amazing."
56623,Great guide! This covers pretty much everything most people would need to know for getting a monitor.
56624,Any love for 240hz monitors?
56625,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/8w9dok/questions_about_240hz/
56626,"I have a 1060 6GB, and I can run 1080p 144hz on almost any game with good fps."
56627,This is exactly what I am afraid of. If I can't watch streams or videos then there is no point to buying second one.
56628,Do you have gsync or freesync in your monitors?
56629,One of mine has gsync (dell s2417dg) and the other has neither gsync nor freesync.
56630,So this seems to be the place to ask it but what about curved monitors? How do they play into all of this? Is it just an aesthetic thing?
56631,"I've read that for 16:9 monitors it is.

21:9 is when it's actually useful."
56632,Actually I have a friend who could lend me a 75 hz AOC monitor but that one is a TN panel. Can't decide whether to go for IPS or not.
56633,"Cc: /u/MikeNotBrick: awesome guide! I would love to see a (sub-)section of the Multi Monitor part that discusses the compatibility/impact of mix and matching refresh rates for multi screen setups. 

I’m currently looking at going from 27”/1440p@60hz dual monitors to 144hz. It’s really hard to find any good info on whether I can upgrade just my main monitor to the asus 27”/144/1440p and use my existing asus 27”/60/1440p for my second screen or if I should upgrade both. 

I keep hearing people mention that alt-tabbing is an issue with different refresh rates and that playing a twitch stream on the 2nd screen while gaming at a higher refresh rate on the 144hz GSYNC screen would cause video to stutter etc. 

Budget isn’t the issue but obviously I don’t want to buy 2 new screens if just upgrading the main one will suffice. 

Also, do gaming modes factor in at all? I usually play “windowed borderless” instead of “full screen” for example as I interact with the second screen a lot. 

Cheers!"
56634,I'm looking for an high refresh rate ultrawide monitor. I have a GTX 1080 TI. Not too concerned about 1080p vs 1440p. Id prefer g-sync. I have budget of €500ish can push a little more if a good deal/monitor is available. Does anyone know of anything?
56635,I have a 780ti. Would it be smart to buy a 144hz 1080p monitor?
56637,Okay thanks! My friend insists on buying a 144hz monitor for himself even though he only has a gt 730. I know it’s stupid but he is most likely going to do it and I can’t stop him. He barely hits 60 FPS in fort nite at 1280 x 720.
56638,I'm seriously considering buying the BenQ XL2411P. Anyone here has any experiences with it?
56639,"All I think should be added is a small segment on [ULMB](https://www.blurbusters.com/faq/motion-blur-reduction/) and such near the adaptive sync category. All modern GSYNC monitors have it.

In a nutshell, it gets rid of almost all motion blur, but makes your monitor significantly dimmer, (Though to be fair, many monitors are very bright to begin with) and can feel a bit stuttery if your framerate is varying wildly. Though tolerance for fluctuation may vary from person to person."
56640,"very nice write up, thank you"
56641,And if you're a color grader then prepare to spend way to much.
56642,"I'm interested in a 4k G-SYNC display, preferably with refresh at least up to 144Hz. The reason is I plan to keep upgrading my gfx card (currently 1080Ti for display, and extras doing processing).. and although I'm most concerned with productivity uses, I like high refresh rates and occasionally game.

I believe a few such displays exist - and sometimes can be had for under $1000 - but I haven't seen a lot mentioned about them, since they're still kind of niche. Some detail I'd be interested in is e.g.: sure it's G-SYNC, but are these displays actually able to drive 4K at 144Hz? Even if I could see my mouse cursor and dragged windows looking smooth on the desktop, that's important in terms of being satisfied. Otherwise it'd be an expensive disappointment."
56643,"I am almost positive the displays you referencing are actually 1440p 144hz, not 4k 144hz. I believe 4k 144hz are coming out sometime later this year, but expect to pay a premium for it (well over $1000 I'd assume, even as much as $2000).

The actual monitor will be able to support 4k at 144hz. The limiting factors will be your graphics card. Currently, even the most powerful graphics cards (like your 1080ti) can't run games at 4k 144hz adequately."
56644,"The monitors I looked at recently emphasized the 4K G-SYNC stuff.. and appeared to have 144Hz (which some people were overclocking to higher refresh rate), but I couldn't find anyone specifically saying that the 4K resolution could run at 144Hz.

I've seen the latest news about a couple $2000 4K ""HDR"" (i.e. ~384 backlight regions and high brightness) 144Hz G-SYNC displays that are supposed to come out this summer - right about now. The article emphasized the ""HDR"" part though, so it fit with my understanding that 4K displays with some 144Hz capability (although unclear if available when running at 4K res) exist. I wish publications and specs would be more clear on what things AREN'T rather than just what they are, but such is the nature of marketing.

I'm aware of the difficulty in rendering things fast at high res. Honestly, I'd probably get the biggest kick out of seeing my mouse cursor movement being smooth as silk, and hardly game. Pretty dumb I guess, but I used to have that on CRT so I kinda miss it.

Update: I think you're right - I think the displays I'd been looking at weren't 4K 144Hz displays. Now I notice that in some online stores, various submodels (i.e. different res and refresh rates) are grouped in the same major model page, and get the same reviews shared across the various submodels. It created a confusing situation where someone seemed to be confirming 165Hz overclocked refresh rate on a 4K display.. but that was actually for a 1440p sibling model (whereas the 4K model was max 60Hz despite G-SYNC). Reviewers apparently got the cool new 4K 144Hz displays a couple days ago, but I'll skip those since $2000 is a bit much for me. I won't consider going beyond around $1000."
56645,"I've been looking for a new ultrawide monitor for both gaming and work (spreadsheets). Does anyone have any info on the new Acer Z35? I keep finding reviews of the old version, but the newer one is 3440x1440 with a VA panel and GSYNC. [Costco](https://www.costco.com/Acer-Predator-Z35-35-Ultra-Wide-Curved-Gaming-Monitor.product.100419479.html) will have these on sale for $700 starting Aug 2 and am contemplating getting it."
56646,"Looking at the Alienware AW3418DW (34” curved, 100-120hz) once 1190s come out. Is this about the best value in the price range? And with a giant monitor where do people put their second? To the right/left or mount it above? Currently using a 24” 1440p 165 hz as my primary and an ips 60hz 27” as my secondary so big change"
56647,"PSA: the monitor mentioned above, the Dell 2716dg is currently on sale at Best Buy (online and in store) for $380. Amazing price, GSync, 1440p, 144hz, etc. Just picked one up yesterday, love it!"
56648,Where were you when I was buying my monitor!? This is freaking amazing guide!
56649,Broke my old monitor and got a samsung s24c450b for 80$ is that a good buy or could i have gotten something better for the price?
56650,"Good guide, the only thing missing is a mention of nVidia’s 3D Vision tech, which is still available on some monitors I think?"
56651,"While I did ""forget"" to include it or even mention it for that matter, I really don't feel it is necessary or even worth mentioning for what this guide is trying to accomplish. This is a buying guide for someone who has limited knowledge about all the different monitor features. What you mentioned is a niche feature that someone looking for a monitor to play some games on won't care about. If you know about Nvidia's 3D Vision Tech, then chances are this guide isn't meant for you."
56652,"Fair enough, although arguably the same could be said about G-Sync and FreeSync - while they are more pervasive technologies than 3DV ever was, they are still niche compared to the “big three” of resolution, frequency and screen size. It’s a bullet point that crops up on a spec list - about the only niche/spec point that doesn’t really need explaining in the same way is ultrawide monitors, because you can see what that is in the image of the monitor itself. All the others, up to and including the tech of the display panel itself, are generally less important than the big three to “someone just looking for a monitor to play some games on”. Maybe the other spec that is important is response time, but generally most people would take a look at the frequency of the monitor and just say bigger = better."
56653,"I'm new to this stuff, so I just have a couple of questions:

-I see that a 1080Ti is recommended for 1440p/144hz gaming, but wouldn't that be for AAA gaming? I've read that 1070Ti can work as well.

-Isn't there a lot of debate around what size of monitor is the best? What do you guys recommend?"
56654,"A 1070ti will work fine with a 1440p 144hz monitor. Don't expect to get the full 144hz though at 1440p with a 1070ti, especially at higher settings. Very dependent on how demanding the game is you are trying to play."
56655,Got it. Thanks!
56656,"I might have missed it, but I would add something for primarily esport title players to prioritize refresh rate/input lag over resolution. If you have a 1060+ and only play league of legends a 1080p120 isn't a waste like it might be if you're primarily playing AAA titles"
56657,"For those of you on a budget, I want to give a shoutout to the Acer R240HY bidx. For around $120 you get a really great 1080p IPS monitor that can be overclocked to ~75hz. I just built my first setup a few weeks ago and that monitor is by far my favorite component. Coming from a smaller, cheap laptop TN panel the difference is like night and day"
56658,"Ah, i saw this on Amazon for $109 a few days ago. Didn't purchase it due to the lack of VESA compatibility."
56659,"How far to sit from a 22-24"" 1080p monitor?"
56660,"Would you recommend a 21.5 or a 24"" monitor extension for my laptop? I have a thinkpad x1 carbon 5th gen."
56661,What do you think about the Alienware monitors?
56662,"I got a VG248QE. And that was becouse it was the only one available locally, and any other choice was overpriced/way over target, so there's also that /shrug"
56663,"I bought a Korean 27"" 1440p monitor as a temporary monitor a couple years ago and it's still going strong and I haven't felt the need to upgrade.  No dead pixels, VESA mounting, IPS, minimal backlight issues, runs at 110Hz, poor monitor controls and a flimsy frame but not a big deal.  Would I recommend it?  If you're on a budget it might be a good deal.  I haven't been monitor shopping for a while though so maybe they don't fill that niche anymore.  I bought it when 1440p was barely on the market and your option was to spend almost twice as much for a brand name one.  Don't do it just to save $50.  A quick check on Newegg shows plenty of sub $300 Acer 27"" monitors so I doubt I'd do it when I can just pick up one of those."
56664,I have a question about adaptive sync! Is screen tearing definitely going to happen if I don't use adaptive sync? I have a budget build in the works with a 1050 ti and was planning on getting a monitor with 1080p and 75 hz. I saw the examples you posted and I definitely want to avoid screen tearing. It sounds like without adaptive sync your fps and hz will almost always be different thus creating screen tear?
56665,"While it will likely be there, you may not even notice it, especially if you've never gamed without adaptive sync before. Also, remember that you are looking at stationary pictures you will only see the tear. When moving in game, it is constantly refreshing the image on screen so the tear isn't in the exact same spot every time. I wouldn't worry too much about adaptive sync and it is still considered a ""luxury"" feature."
56666,Thanks for the fast response and the awesome post!
56667,Thanks for the update on the guide. Lots of work/effort from you and I know it’s appreciated greatly by us. Thanks again!
56668,So should I use my 24 inch TV with 8 ms response time as my monitor to save some money ?
56669,"240hz 1080p Freesync or 144hz 1080 gsync.
Planning to use it with 1080/1080ti(if good deal comes outl/1170(if it is out < 3 months)"
56670,I think picking the right display is the most complicated part of building a computer. Wish I found something like this when I first got started.
56671,"The timing of this post could not have been more perfect. Debating upgrading from my 1440p QNIX IPS monitor cause the active adapter i bought is causing occasional on/off. In hindsight I should have just saved up the 350 dollars I ended up spending to get a 27"" 1440p 144hz gysnc IPS monitor haha... Oh well. 


It's between the asus and the acer ones right now I would love to pick up the viewsonic one but yeah 1-2k no thanks.

Since amazon is trying to kill everyone with their monthly payment thing I'll probably go with getting it from them. Currently looking at either:

Acer Predator XB271HU bmiprz 27"" WQHD (2560x1440) NVIDIA G-SYNC IPS Monitor, (Display Port & HDMI Port, 144Hz) 



ASUS ROG SWIFT PG279Q 27"" 2560x1440 IPS 165Hz 4ms G-SYNC Eye Care Gaming Monitor with DP and HDMI ports

The Asus one is more expensive by 100 dollars. But I don't know if that's really worth it. I'm thinking that this resolution and refresh rate is going to last me for a very long time and especially once the mid range cards can actually push this resolution with every cranked to the max at 144hz it'd be nice to have gsync in the meantime. I would have picked up the Dell TN panel one that bestbuy had a days ago but I just can't go back to playing my rpgs like witcher 3 on a TN panel. If anyone can put the final nail in the coffin that would be great as I haven't paid much attention to CES but last I checked the upcoming monitors or adapative sync TV's and such since I both pc and console game are just too damn expensive hah."
56672,got the parts to build i5-8400 and 1060 6gb system. i pretty much just play overwatch. best monitor for my situation?
56673,TN panels are far superior for gaming due to the very quick response time. It's still isn't fast enough for color to color and causes some ghosting even at high refresh rate.
56674,"This was a great read! Thank you for the info, got something new for myself!"
56675,Great post thank you for such up to date info!!
56676,Can anyone recommend a budget 1080p @ 60hz (1920 x 1080) monitor? I have a R9 270 and play mostly older games. Apart from that it will be mostly used for watching movies and surfing.
56677,What's the best ultra wide for movies? It's like something HDR10 ready if possible.
56678,"Thanks for this useful guide.

I'd like to mention the R9 Fury is very capable at 1440p,144hz. You won't get a consistent 144fps on AAA games (100ish) but still very good with free sync."
56679,"This is an excellent detailed writeup and you've put a huge amount of work into it, so I dislike being picky, but I have a suggestion. I think you need a third use category for color-accurate photo editing/review. Although you mention ""good color reproduction"" in the section on panel types, I'm sure many readers would benefit from a summary on sRGB and AdobeRGB, and a list of the best 100% AdobeRGB gamut monitors on the market. (I know the tech details, but keeping up with the market offerings is tough!)"
56680,"Do you guys have any suggestion as how to clean the monitor screen?

I have a benq xl2430t and I am very satisfied with it, but it really needs some cleaning now and I am afraid of doing something wrong and damaging the monitor."
56681,Well I would like to be able to watch something while playing Europa universalis at the same time. I am not sure if I will like it. Maybe I am just hyped because of the cool setups I see online.
56682,"Guys I'm thinking about  pulling the plug on an AOC Agon Black. Naturally I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about spending so much money on something I cant see first. So want to make absolutely sure I'm making the right decision. 

I've been internally debating monitors for weeks and it's easily been the hardest piece to choose out of the entire build. 

Reviews are favorable. What's the communities opinion in the monitor. Shoukd I take the plunge?"
56683,What GPU and CPU do you have?
56684,Will be getting i5 8600k and the gtx 1180. Unlikely to buy anything until new gpus release.
56685,Could you link me the monitor you are looking at?
56686,https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/aoc-agon-ag352ucg6-black-edition
56687,Also considering the BenQ EX3501R as a cheaper alternative.
56688,I think it's basically a choice between HDR or gsync.
56689,"Anyone have any recommendations for a monitor around $200? I can stretch the budget up to $250 if necessary. I would prefer IPS, but I could probably be convinced to go for TN if its a good panel. A higher refresh rate would be great but I don't know whats possible in my budget. I would like 1080p 23-24""."
56690,"I've done a lot of research into monitors and GPUs after I read your post yesterday and I am curious to what you think of using Adaptive Vsync on a 75hz monitor with a 1050 ti? I know that v sync can get bad when your GPU under produces fps, but I think adaptive V sync auto turns v sync on and off depending if you are over or under. (again I think) Besides the small input lag, how do you think this would compare to no adaptive sync at all? would screen tearing get worse? or better?"
49509,"The [VG240Y](https://reddlink.tech/acer-vg240y) is great. Although if you're willing to go to 4K, the [LG27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850) is amazing and worth it."
49510,I'd say probably the top 2 in the stickied post.  The Acer Nitro and the Viewsonic.
49511,BenQ EX2510 if you want accurate colors and AOC 24G2 if you want more vibrant colors. They're both really fast. ViewSonic XG2405 is also great if you want slightly deeper blacks and vibrant colors but it's a bit slower. Avoid XL2411K and XL2411P. They have terrible picture quality and are only good if all you do is play CS:GO with backlight strobing.
49512,My personal favorite is the LG Ultrawide from your list.

48954,"I'm facing exactly the same dilemma. So far I too have identified the LG27GL850 as an option, as well as the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. They are similarly priced and have very similar specs, so I'd appreciate any input on which to choose (or if there is something else entirely)."
48955,"I bought that LG during one of its amazon sales for about $370 and I love it. I can’t really compare it to anything other than its predecessor—an 11yr old 1080p 60hz tn HP, but I have not had a single issue with the monitor the past two months I’ve had it."
48956,"I also got a LG 27GL83a during one of the sales.  In my opinion, for most people the 27GL83a is the one to go.  I wrote up [a brief comparison of that and the 27GL850 in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapclounge/comments/gio3n3/review_of_27gl83ab_and_differences_between_27gl850/)  Basically, the 27GL850 is good if you do photo editing because of a slightly higher color gamut.  Most people can't tell the difference though."
48957,"Be careful about telling people to get the GL850 for photo editing, especially if your primary still image output is for the web, then I wouldn't recommend a wide gamut monitor since what you will be seeing won't be reflected in what you post to the web in the 8-bit sRGB format, due to the majority of people using sRGB.

I work in photography so I have a wide gamut NEC digital image monitor, but my editing output is just for the web, so I have it set to sRGB. If I need any wide gamut output for CMYK printing or anything it would be a different story.

Anther problem is, mid to low end monitors do not do the wide gamut very well, as expressed by many experts, often even after calibration. However, some people love the overly saturated and extreme vibrance look that the wide gamut gives, but I wouldn't use it for photo editing for the web.

The most ideal workflow for photo editing would be, work from a raw data/RAW files, render that raw data in the widest gamut, highest bit depth you can, and then you would convert down to an sRGB image for the web or mobile devices."
48958,Thanks.  That’s a good write up that you made.  You should post this on r/buildaplounge as it’s own post.
48959,"Yeah wide gamut is beneficial if you're doing real colour work and can calibrate it to actually properly display 100% srgb, otherwise at the very least you need a decent srgb mode on the monitor"
48960,"Oh thanks for the correction! I assumed they were the same model. I suppose I too can notice black colors are not always as dark as I’d like them to be, but I do a lot of adobe design/video work and even then it isn’t really a problem for me."
48961,"you wont find a ips panel with deep blacks, it's one of the main downsides of ips panels vs va. Not to say that ips are  worse than va."
48962,Seconded for this monitor. Had it since April and I absolutely love it.
48964,Oh shit I just noticed your post is the one that made me decide to get it! Thanks for the write-up! I loved it and it helped me make my decision. :)
48965,You’re totally welcome!  :D
48966,"I got an 83a as well, love it"
48967,I bought the LG-GL83a during Amazon sale as well. The only issue I have is that in the device manager it's recognized as GL850 version. Think I saw the same in the driver settings somewhere.
48968,"I believe that is because it's the same panel as the 850, so LG left the identifier like that for some reason. 

Mine is like that as well, I wouldn't worry about it."
48969,It's definitely supposed to be like that. If you go to LG's website for driver downloads it gives you the 85 drivers.
48970,"I have one too, I love it, I didn't need the higher color range, yeah it's recognized as an 850 but oh well, they're practically the same, just different panels."

48978,"""Every category except the two you can most perceive with human eyes"""

48983,"If we're comparing popular resources, LTT compares the two directly as well in this video. [https://youtu.be/aFZ5ofmZt58?t=214](https://youtu.be/aFZ5ofmZt58?t=214)

TL;DW: LG won"
48984,"Hey check out the tftcentral review as well! I bought the vg27aq on sale in Australia and love it but admit it's not the best at lower refresh rates so if you play console or any games that'll drive your fps down to the 60-80 range consider that!

I haven't experienced the LG myself but when doing due dilligence on other people's experiences it seems the LG is more consistent across different fps and refresh rates"
48985,I recently purchased the Asus model and would recommend it if gaming is your main concern.
48986,I was going through same choices and got the TUF - loving it so far (first 1440p monitor). Don't think you can wrong with either - just a price / availability screen now.
48987,"Both my brother and I got the ASUS monitor and we both love it, my brother literally talks about it all the time and my own came perfect out of the box so no complaints here"
48988,My ASUS TUF VG27AQ kicks ass and I love it. Decent price
48989,"> VG27AQ

How much did you get it for? Thanks!"
48990,"I got it for $275, ordered from Microcenter (US)"
48991,"> VG27AQ

Wow. It's 580€ in Greece right now.."
48992,"One caveat to the monitor is its mediocre performance at 60hz refresh rate. It's very likely, depending on your GPU and what kind of games you play, that you will be playing some games closer to 60hz than 100+ (if you're planning 1440p ultra).

I was going to go with the TUF because of the price and despite the mediocre 60hz performance, but then the BenQ EX2770q went on sale for basically the same price as the TUF, which has far better 60hz performance. 

Honestly OP there's no such thing as the ""best"" gaming monitor. Every single panel has its benefits and drawbacks. The only panels I consider unsuitable for gaming are VA panels. I have yet to see a VA panel that has consistent gray-to-gray response rate; that's why they're notorious for ghosting/smearing."
48993,I have the LG and it's really nice. I think it hits tons of boxes and was considered best bang for your buck given the amazing specs.
48994,"I have the ASUS. Was thinking about the LG as well, but it wouldn't fit the location I have the monitor (too tall, even with the lowest height setting).

I love it."
48995,"Haha, I had this dilemma last week. Bought the LG850 and I am super happy with it. Easy to setup and good calibration straight out the box. Can highly recommend it."
48996,I've just bought the Asus TUF. For the same price I decided to stick with Asus as my old monitor that I was very pleased with an Asus and from the reviews I've read the differences are small enough to not matter to me personally. Not regretting at all right now.
48997,Bought the vg27aq about a month ago... i absolutely love it. Went from a 1080p 144 to this one. Its worth the money imo.
48998,"I originally bought the vg27aq but there was an issue where a few pixels in the top left of the screen displayed the image from the bottom right of the screen. I went through 3 of these monitors before deciding it must be a firmware issue and ended up returning it. Afterwards I bought the lg27gl850, and it provides identical picture quality with no issues whatsoever."
48999,"So this won't be seen by more than a fraction of who it is intended for, but I'd like to thank every single one of you who commented. It really helped me make my decision and I just ordered the LG monitor. Honestly it could have gone either way."
49000,"27GL850 is, from what I've seen, generally considered one of the best all around 1440p gaming monitors because it has great response time but the other benefits that come with an IPS panel. I bought one and have been very happy with it so far. 

Hardware Unboxed does pretty good monitor reviews, maybe watch this video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVd3LX2DCCQ"
49001,"I'm absolutely loving mine...would recommend the LG GL850 to any 1440P player and the LG GN950 to any 4K player!

For lovers of VA panels, the VG27WQ is amazing as well. Slightly curved."
49002,That video is the one that made me decide to pay more for LG
49003,"I have the 29” version, and it’s quite nice as well."
49004,There are a few coming out such as the Samsung G7 although that is curved.  This years new monitors appear to have been delayed due to the coronavirus.  I’m looking at buying a new monitor too but hoping to get one with enough bells and whistles to not feel outdated in a couple of years.  Right now I’m on a 24 inch 1080P with 144 hz refresh rate.
49005,"Don’t forget the G7 has a 240hz refresh rate., but I believe the 24in starts at ~$700."
49006,"Just to nitpick, it starts at 27 inch, then 32 inch"
49007,Nice catch!
49008,Thought you were about to say Samsung Smart Fridge
49009,I have the Dell 2719DGF (1440p 144hz) which I got for around 230 after rebates and discounts and I think it’s the best choice I’ve made so far.
49010,I have 3 of these. They’re very good.
49011,"Bought one of these recently, no regrets, great monitor"
49012,This. Been great for me.
49013,I got a broken S2417DG for $100 that I RMA’d and got a brand new one. Can’t say enough good things about it. The pixel density is awesome in a 24’ 1440p
49014,"Yeah, I've got one and it's fucking great. Got it on sale for $300 at micro center with my stimulus check

24"" which is preferable for competitive FPS  
1440p  
165hz and 1ms response, also has G-Sync for when I'm not playing FPS  
4 USB ports  
Height adjustable, tilt adjust, swivel base, aaaaand can be rotated"
49015,It’s such a good monitor. I’m holding onto it until 34’ 21:9 ips displays with 120hz are ~$500
49016,I feel the color is a little funky but it's probably because I have two monitors with different screen types. For the price it's been great. Also it overclocks to 155hz and I haven't noticed any negative side affects.
49017,"Keep in mind, the F at the end denotes freesync. Without the F is G-sync"
49018,It works with nvidia too for the last two gens!
49019,I'd still go with a g sync monitor. Though you pay a premium because it's licensed.
49020,I wasn't going to buy one after all the mixed reviews but this monitor is pretty awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone.
49021,Saved so I can try to find a used one on the ebays one day when I have money again
49022,Love this monitor
49023,"My wife and I each got a Dell 2716DGR (1440p 144hz G-Sync flat screen) a year ago and love them for both gaming and productivity. (Paired with RTX 2080 cards) I think these are really underrated.

Edit:  Forgot to add that it often sells for under $300 US, usually when Best Buy puts them on sale! But that was before coronavirus started messing with production and demand, so I don't know if you'll see that price any time soon."
49024,"Jesus, is that what they go for now? Back when I build my rig in 2017. They were going for about $600 without taxes. I walked into Best Buy one day to buy my brother an Xbox for Christmas that year for the holidays, and after eyeing that monitor for weeks I saw it at Best Buy on sale for $400. They didn’t have any models for me to take home but I made sure I bought one anyways. Thought I got it for a steal. Crazy how time flies"
49026,Have this monitor. I love it. Super easy to adjust any way you need and works very well if you plan on adding more monitors down the road.
49027,"I just got 2 27GL850s, and have to say they are pretty awesome!

I also considered the VG27AQ and the 27GL83A-B. From what I read, the 27GL83A-B is nearly identical to the 27GL850, but lacks a few features and is over 100 dollars cheaper. I would have probably gone with the 27GL83A-B, but they were out of stock at the time.

I know monitors are in short supply right now, so keep that in mind as well."
49028,"I am eyeing the same monitor but coming from a pretty basic 22"" 1080p TN monitor my main concerns are:

- My 1660ti
- The blacks

What's your experience with respect to the above?"
49029,"Pushing 144 fps on a 1660 seems unlikely on many top titles. 

I don't have any complaints on the contrast of the monitor. However, I don't play a lot of dark games or watch movies on it. In general, I would say that the image quality is outstanding and I don't have any complaint. In fact, the only complaint I have about the monitor is the price. They are relatively expensive."
49030,"I’ve owned the ASUS VG27AQ for around 6 months now and it’s been a dream to play on, I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a 1440p monitor with a high refresh rate."
49031,I have two LG27GL850 as I was pretty set on getting an IPS monitor with a low refresh rate. I may be biased because I'm upgrading from 1080p 60hz but It feels like I'm seeing clearly for the first time. I've had no complaints with the monitors. They're absolutely gorgeous.
49032,"I am eyeing the same monitor but coming from a pretty basic 22"" 1080p 60Hz TN monitor my main concerns are:

- My 1660ti
- The blacks

..and its price.

What's your experience with respect to the above?"
49033,The blacks are pretty good. No real complaints with contrast. The colors in general on this monitor are great. A lot of people complain about backlight bleed on ips monitors but it's pretty minimal with these. I had a 2070 super in this build but I had to RMA it so I've been running my old 970 for awhile until my replacement comes in and I'm still getting decent framerates in most games. I think your 1660 will be fine. Granted I'm not playing anything super taxing with the 970 mostly just league or valorant which run on almost anything.
49034,"I just recently purchased an LG 27GL850-b, and then I purchased a Viewsonic vx2758-2kp-mhd as a secondary monitor.  The Viewsonic was $200 cheaper, and I think I would have been satisfied getting two of them in the first place instead of paying up for the LG.  

I looked up the differences between these two models when shopping, but I don't remember what they are anymore, because I can't tell any difference with day to day usage.  I'd be fine gaming on either, but I use the more expensive LG  as the main monitor since it's ""supposed"" to be better..."
49035,"I love that ViewSonic, I have it as my primary monitor and it's honestly amazing, but anything was a step up from Xbox on a 32"" TV. I highly recommend it."
49036,"LG 27GL850 or  27GL83a. A lot of reviewers saying the significant price difference isn't worth the upgrade though to the 850. The 850 has a ""better"" color gamut that most people won't notice. It also has ""nano ips"" which is their tech term for fast response time on IPS but reviewers say it's not a significant difference. Unless u got money to burn, just stick to the 83a. 

I personally wouldn't buy other monitors. It's LG man, they've been making monitor and TV panels for decades now. This is what they're known for whereas the other brands are just gaming companies that only know how to slap fancy gaming terms on their monitors."
49037,"I picked up a MSI Optix MAG272QR back in March for about €320. 165hz, 27"" 1440p. It's really beautiful."
49038,Just ordered one of these yesterday! It arrives in 5 days and I couldn’t be more excited
49039,I think the Benq EX2780Q is worth a look.
49040,"I just picked up this monitor and it is by far the best monitor I have ever used. Excellent colors, decent brightness, quality IPS panel. HDR is alright, but makes things look really yellow and lacks the ability to locally dim the panel; on the HDR videos I watched on YouTube using the HDR setting the brights were way oversaturated.

I do like HDRi, which emulated HDR for regular content. I tend to play single player games, and the visual pop the setting gives most games is great."
49041,"Hdr is my one misgiving I think I’ve seen some people do tweaks to get it up to snuff though

edit: it also has a remote i cannot stress how much i love that this thing has a remote. When im doing a lot of reading it makes it very easy to turn on what i like to call paper white mode."
49042,"Take a look at the viewsonic ips 144hz 1440p one, i buyed it for 340€ amazon germany and i think it was the best decision ive made. The lg one is better but at what cost ? Im sure its the same panel"
49043,"I’ve had the Asus 27” iPS 144hz 1440p that everybody sweared by and it doesn’t compare to the LG model the exact same one you are considering is the one I switched to and I won’t ever go back! It’s quite literally a dream monitor! Colors, Blacks, refresh rate, response time, everything is 10/10 A-1 sauce! Even though it’s a little expensive it’s got such a nice picture quality that I may consider changing all my TVs and monitors in the house to LG."
49044,"I grabbed the HP Omen 27i last month, it’s $399 rn ($100 off). Nano IPS. Released just a few weeks ago, it’s amazing but not curved. Also has rgb backlight"
49045,Aoc cq27g2 a good monitor?
49046,I have the 32 in version and it’s pretty damn nice.
49047,"I got the Gigabyte Aorus FI27Q. $500 for 1440p 165hz ips. Beautiful screen and loads of extra features. Great design with leds. The monitor also have an very sturdy stand, well made. I absolutely love it."
49048,I’m gonna get that Lg monitor. Microcenter is out of stock.
49049,I ordered straight from LG because no one had stock anywhere.
49050,I got my lg last week off of amazon.
49051,"Yea, I've seen stock coming back slowly. I got mine about 3 weeks ago and the only ones one amazon were $300 more than ordering direct from LG."
49052,lg27gl83a OR Lenovo y27q20
49053,Viewsonic 2758-2kp-mhd 1440p 144hz 1ms monitor is what I have and it gives beautiful color with no problems so far. (Also only costs about $300)
49054,For the Money LG GL850 27” or if you can find it $399 Pixio PX7 Prime 27” I have both ask me anything.
49055,How do you like the px7 prime?
49056,It’s equal to the LG GL850 just with a warmer color tone it’s amazing and crazy bright.
49057,"I went with the Pixio PX7 as well. Really, really impressed by it."
49058,"I went with the lg 27gl83a-b and no regrets. It’s cheaper than the 850, same panel just no USB ports and other minor things"
49059,I cannot stress enough that I dont reccomend an asus monitor. They seem to have no quality control whatsoever and it is a coin toss whether you get a monitor that works properly or not.
49060,"No one has mentioned this which I am shocked. The EVE devices Soectrum monitor is the most all-encompassing monitor and is set to release in Q4.  You can choose from 1440p 144hz, 1440p 240hz, and 4k 144hz.

Plus the stand is optional so you can make it cheaper by $100 if you have a vesa arm already."
49061,I did have my eye on this but I'm looking for a more immediate purchase within the next month or so. Maybe I will get it as a 2nd monitor in the future.
49062,"EDIT: it's a shame that none of the reviews I have seen/read mentioned any of these points and I have seen everything that was available at the time: youtubers, websites, you name it.

I have AORUS AD27QD. Certainly would not buy again for the following reasons:

* the triangular type stand the gaming monitors have these days are ridiculous. It's just ergonomically bad. I don't care for the ""space"" look or whatever they were going for.
* I thought the ability to control screen settings from Windows level was a cool feature. But implementation is so bad that it makes it almost useless. If you create a profile in ~~shitkick~~ sidekick software, as soon as you change something through the monitor OSD, all goes to shit, you lose all your settings.
* Contrast turned out to be average at best (measured using screen calibration hardware). Some reviews claimed it to be really good, was one of the reasons I got it.
* Headphones noise cancelling - works but:
   * you lose audio quality if you want to use a headset. Not input but output i.e. if you connect headphones to the screen, the audio quality is poor.
   * you have to disconnect anything from the USB in the screen if you want to use noise cancelling. This is because the mic will register constant high pitch noise .
* USB ports are placed in a really bad spot. I had Dells and HPs and they all had USBs on the side - easily accessible but not here. It's easier to dive under the desk to plug something in than finding USB on Aorus.
* Quality is not great - I already have issues with the USB port disconnecting and I only had this screen for not even a year. It's breaking despite the fact that I have a USB extension so that I don't constantly plug/unplug things.
* Screen seems to get confused if two devices are connected and you turn off one or unplug one. But maybe all screens have this problem, don't know.

Overall, the panel is good and all but this product falls apart at functionality/ergonomics level + is overpriced for what it is."
49063,"I have to agree with you on the poor implementation of the OSD software (which would honestly be a great thing if it worked as intended), but I really do like the design of the stand. It takes up very little room on the desk, it's more adjustable than any other monitor I've owned, and it feels very sturdy. What exactly do you mean ""ergonomically bad""?"
49064,"I am referring to the pointy legs that occupy desk space and are not flat. Normally, monitor stand is flat and is located directly under the centre of the screen. It also occupies much less space."
49065,I swear by my Acer XZ272UP
49066,"My uncle got the Acer Nitro XV272U Pbmiiprzx 27"" a few months back and he says it's amazing. It's 1440p, 144hz refresh rate, and it has an ips panel. It's kinda pricey rn, but he got it on sale at microcenter for only $330. It has amazing colors along with the 1ms response time makes this monitor top tier."
49067,"I went with the LG myself. Pretty hard to beat for the price.

But if price is not an issue, I would go with something from ASUS in the $700+ range. Primarily for the the better HD."
49068,"best? that can be hugely subjective, but I can tell you the 27GL850 is beautiful and is amazing for gaming. Unless your an esports/tourney player who needs that 240hz TN panel the LG is my go to."
49069,"It’s a little dated now and you can most likely find something equivalent to it for less but I’ve had my Asus PG279Q for almost 3 yrs now and I couldn’t be happier with it. There are some QC issues where backlight bleed is more present than others but mine is hardly noticeable and I don’t even notice it during gameplay. Linus also did a video on it referring to it as “the holy grail of monitors” It definitely was and still is one of the best all around monitors you can buy. 


https://www.asus.com/us/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-SWIFT-PG279Q/"
49070,I've got the GL850B and it's great but colours are shit out of the box so find a good custom ICC profile
49071,"I got the LG 27gl850 this year, one had some weire problem and a dead pixel and the second one has a dead pixel and has since gotten another dead pixel.

However during normal use I don't see these dead pixels at all really and the quality of this monitor absolutely outweighs the issue of the deadpixel, its a beautiful screen and games run like a dream with my 1080ti. 

I absolutely recommend it I had two Asus monitors beforehand and both had horrendous ips glow and backlight bleed while neither of my LG 27GL850's had any backlight bleed at all."
49072,I have the Aorus FI27Q and love it. Don’t have a lot of room for a desk so it works nicely.
49073,I got the HP 27xq for 180€ ! I'm very happy with it and it's very cheap in my opinion for a 144hz 1440p :)
49074,"Idk how the prices in us are but in Canada I built my pc in may and got a 1440p144 monitor and the cheapest one was a Samsung, I think it was like c27jg52, it was a curved monitor if you had one and didn't like it then ignore me, but honestly it's pretty much the same as a flat monitor, the stand was shit but I wanted a vesa anyways and honestly it's great, it doesn't have freesync but with high enough frames it shouldn't be an issue really, it is a va panel so if you don't like that then it's not for you either."
49075,"I decided on that monitor but couldn’t find it in stock a couple months back when I was buying. 

Ended up going with an Hp Omen 27i when it was on sale at Best Buy. I’ve been really happy with it. I should say though, I’m no expert and there weren’t a ton of professional reviews."
49076,"I have viewsonic elite xg270qg and it’s awesome... I first bought an asus gaming 1080p 240hz and it was nice but it really doesn’t compare... I think you’ll have a tough time finding something nicer than the Viewsonic Elite...

I have a 75” LG 4k and it’s compatible for sure when you are sitting 12”-20” from the 2k 27” screen it’s pretty good"
49077,I have the asus tuf vg27aq. If the 165hz overclock and IPS is a big deal to you then I would opt in for this monitor. if you’re strictly looking for just a 144hz 1440p monitor then the dell s2719 is a great option.
49078,I don't know much about monitors but my cousin owns a 27GL850 and he is in love with it
49079,"I love the 27GL850
IPS panel looks fantastic, input lag is at a minimum, and I haven’t noticed any ghosting or backlight issues."
49080,"I had also considered the LG you were looking at, but ended up going with the GL83A-B. Been a fantastic monitor so far, super responsive, great resolution and viewing angles, all that jazz. Doesn't have as wide of a color range as the GL850, but as others have said, most really won't notice the difference, and some actually prefer the GL83A-B's colors because it can look less oversaturated in game and much closer to the developers' intended colors. Overall, $120 cheaper and the only real difference is that color gamut. Can't recommend the GL83A-B enough!"
49081,"Agon AG241QX -> I have it, it's great"
49082,I have the Dell S2719DGF1 and the Benq GW2765HT. They're both pretty decent and work towards my needs.
49083,"If you want to play fps / competitive games and you have a pretty powerful gpu then i would recommend the Hp omen x 27 (1440p, 240hz, 1ms, 27"", TN) or there is the eve spectrums. They aren't out yet but planned for 2020 Q4 release. They have a 1440p 144hz IPS 27"" 1ms for $400 or a version with 240hz for $550."

49097,Look at the Samsung Odyssey G7 and G9 they are pretty great. LTT just did a video on them
49098,"I personally have the  LG 27GN850-B priced at $449. $50 cheaper than the LG 27GL850 . Same panel , with only difference is the $449 version not having the usb hub."
49099,If your looking for budget (as I was) the viotek GN27DW  is what I got and its excellent for the money.
49100,"I'm in the exact same position, want to jump on the LG but have time to wait a few months I'm not in a rush. Curious what replies here will say."
49101,"I have a 32 inch Alienware ultrawide (3440x1440) with g-sync that runs at 120Hz. I like it quite a bit but I honestly wish I'd just opted for a 4K monitor instead - I want more vertical resolution.

If you want the ""best"" gaming monitors, look for ones that do true HDR (i.e. over 1000 nits) with either G-Sync Ultimate or Freesync depending on what card you use, along with 144Hz+

EDIT: I'd suggest the Acer X32 which can run G-Sync Ultimate at 200Hz and has a fantastic color gamut and 1440 nits HDR support. Cost is $3,600 but you said price wasn't a problem. review here"": https://www.cnet.com/news/acers-predator-x32-gaming-monitor-seems-awesome-its-also-3600-ces-2020/"

49104,"I have the LG27GL83a, it's an excellent monitor with two exceptions. 1.) You can't pan the screen horizontally. It can tilt up/down and be raised/lowered, but can't adjust left/right. 2.) The standard base takes up a lot of space. I'm strongly considering getting a VESA mount off the back of my desk to free up the desk space.

Otherwise, colors look good, response time is good, it's g-sync compatible for Nvidia cards, and it's a reasonable price."
49105,"I have the LG panel you're looking at and love it. The HDR on it isn't aassss impressive as others I've seen, but HDR on windows is a broken pile of junk anyway sooooo yeah. Very crisp nanocell IPS panel, 144, 1440p, and freesync/gsync. I can never go back to anything less"
49106,May I ask why not a curved monitor?
49107,"best one imo is the acer predator xb271hu. there is an asus variant of it as well that is the same panel but slightly more expensive due to better frame. i have the predator and i think its the best 1440p panel out there. it's like 500 bucks on sale with 27inches, 1440p, 165hz, IPS (the reason i went with this one), g-sync, HDMI +DP, and a pretty deep settings menu. i think there is a new variant of it from both manufacturers with hdr, but from what i read it's not ""true"" hdr as it's less than 1000 nits peak brightness."
49108,"If you have an AMD GPU, the Acer nitro VG271 is good. 27 inch, 144hz, 1ms response time and AMD Freesync."
49109,Acer predator
49110,It's a pretty decent price too
49111,Any cheaper options?
49112,Pixio px7 prime
49113,Take a look at the Pixio Px7 Prime or the new Px277 Prime (difference with the Px7 and Px277 is the 277 having a 1MS response time). Both are 165hz native and 1440p and I have two Px7 Primes. Runs beautifully with Freesync/Gsync/V-Sync.
49114,"LG27GL850  here, no ragrets."
49115,I'm in the same boat. I have kinda settled on the xg270qg and was hoping for more reviews than the one in here. I do want to see reviews g7 before I go in on xg270qg
49116,I have the Dell 2716 and love it
49117,"LTT reviewed the new Samsung G9, but it’s got a fairly aggressive curve, but it was 1440p 240hz with Qled...can’t get much better than that I think, but it’s like $1700, but you did say money was no object lol.  I’d say go with that if you can live with the curvieness."
49118,"You could go with the VIOTEK GN27D 27.0"" 2560x1440 144 Hz Monitor.  Bout 200 bucks cheaper same res same refresh rate"
49119,"If you wanna go really exotic, I got a Pixio PX329. 144hz. I really like it!"
49120,Get the TN Asus I have it and it blew my away wit he the price to performance 400 for 165hz and .4ms response time as well as 1440p
49121,"If you don't want to read, just watch this for 20 seconds: [https://youtu.be/aFZ5ofmZt58?t=286](https://youtu.be/aFZ5ofmZt58?t=286)

TL;DW: Clean cut: if the LG 27GL850 is sold out, buy the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. Or wait.

&#x200B;

I've done extensive research on the subject and the best 1440p, 144hz monitors on the market are the LG 27GL850 and the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. The argument for both is this:

LG 27GL850: Best picture/colors, best motion control. Con: its blacks aren't the deepest (but it is an IPS monitor, so that makes sense).

ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ: Has better blacks than the LG 27GL850 (however, it's also an IPS monitor as well so that's not saying much). Cons: Not as good colors as the LG 27GL850 and if the monitor drops below 80 FPS (some say 100 FPS) it has some type of issue (I forget exactly what it is. You can find it easily though if you use google to find reddit threads that compare the two monitors).

The VAST major of people think the LG 27GL850 is better (including me). The LG 27GL83a is almost the same except its color is worse and it's like $100 cheaper.

&#x200B;

So that's about it."
49122,I've been using the VG27AQ for a week now and it's been incredible so far.
49123,"Anyone using Benq? I mostly see LG, ASUS and Dell in comments here. As far as I have known and heard - Benq produces one of the best monitors for 144, 4K and another designer monitors. Any comments?"
49124,"i like the ROG swift PG279Q

but i wanted one with specifically g-sync and a square base (g-sync is not worth it. it works in real ful lscreen, but more and more games are going borderlerss where it breaks and due to how gpu renders frames in g-sync mode it makes distracting lines and flickers)"
49125,Go for Ben 2580q it's crazy good
49126,"I was in the same boat, and just bought the lg cus it seemed like a safe bet and had everything I wanted, 1440p 144hz, gsync and Ips. No point looking for more if thats everything I want for a price I like."
49127,That new samsung G9 is 5kx1440 240hz hdr i think isn't it? If price isn't a problem I'd say that is probably the best 1440p gaming monitor.
49128,"LG27GL850 is too damn good. That is, if you want to drop $500."
49129,Well the g7 odyssey is pretty beafy but I would also recommend tue Samsung C27JG5
49130,"I have a 1440p Dell, 24"" I believe and its absolutely amazing. Vesa mount, great colors (and corrections), bright and 144hz."
49131,"I own the Omen X 27 and I am really happy with it. It’s a 1440p 240hz TN-pannel monitor (compared to other TN monitors, this pannel looks very good in my opinion after you set it to your liking: very vibrant, very contrasty, super fast). It’s Freesync 2 certified but also works with (mine) Nvidia (G-sync) graphics card.

I also had the LG but returned it because of the BLB and the its contrast and some dead pixels."
49132,that one really cheap amazing Viewsonic 144hz one just shot up in price...
49133,"At 1440p, the PG279Q dominates."
49134,"I got a 27GL83A-B, which is nearly identical to the 27GL850 and I absolutely love it. My only regret is not getting two of them to replace my second monitor."
49135,"I'm very happy with my 27GL850. No issues, very minimal backlight bleed, great colours. I cannot however say anything about how it would compare with a different monitor, but if I were to break this one for whatever reason, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one as a replacement."
49136,"If you can get either of the two LGs recommended here on sale that would be the best option. That being said I want to throw another option in. I got the Pixio PX7 Prime 27"" on sale thought and I haven't regretted it. Have owned it since October and it is an excellent monitor.

https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/pixio/px7-prime"
49137,"I have the LG and I can confirm, this monitor is very good. Mine has minimal ips glow but that's normal and since it's launch the price dropped quite well so I can really recommend it. The only thing I don't like is that you can't swivel it left and right, idk why they decided to do that. Also the stand is quite deep so It takes some space on your desk in terms of depth.

The other option would be the viewsonic which also has nano ips. I'd buy the one which is cheaper"
49138,Get the Alienware AW3418DW or the AW3420DW Ultra wide UWQHD IPS 120mhz monitor 😁
49139,"I’ve seen several people who tried the 27GL850 and the Asus XG279Q, they all said the asus was better, one said it was much better. Not sure if they’re the same price where you are, but given how good asus’ monitors have been at the top end for the last 5 years I’d take the xg if I were you. Prad.de gave it a higher score than the lg too, and said it was the best 1440p monitor they ever reviewed, they’re much more thorough than most other sites too."
49140,"Another vote for gl850 from me. I got one as my main monitor, loved it. Then I got one to replace my second screen so they matched, then there was a sale and I got a third for my gf work from WFH setup, one day I'll steal it for a triple setup."
49141,Best 144hz 1440 for around 300 or under?
49142,I wish price was not a problem for me
49143,I wish there was 3440x1440@120-144hz IPS at a decent price.
49144,"Best of these?

*  **Acer XF270HU Cbmiiprx** 
*  **ViewSonic VX3258-2KC-MHD 32 Inch**  
*  **LG 27GL83A-B**"
49145,Is 1440 4k?
49146,Samsung 1440 super ultra wide ;)
49147,"If you wanted you could get the 27"" Oddysey g7 for $100 more and get 240hz instead of 144hz."
49148,"I bought the Asus initially however had issues with the display going to sleep when connected to pc through DisplayPort, and wouldn’t turn back on unless unplugged. Other people on reddit have reported this issue. 

On top of that I had a Dead Pixel so returned it for the LG. So far no sleep mode issues!"

56825,"What should I get if on a super low budget, and I’m not looking for anything at all but an extra screen? Doesn’t need to be more than 60hz, more than 1080p, a certain size, have speakers, any other features other than its existence. Doesn’t even need to be that high quality, it’s going to exclusively be an extra screen."
56826,"Qualifier: I'm a monitor noob, and this may not be all that helpful.

But, if you're really on a budget and not looking to get anything really crazy it might be worth checking out second hand places like craigslist, ebay, etc. Many people were selling monitors that you described for often super cheap. If you do a bit of digging you can probably find a nice deal."

I've been having issues finding one. I was checking out the [Predator XB3](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/predator-model/UM.HX3AA.X05) but found out it's only ""G-SYNC Compatible"" which ended up making me cancel the order after finding out the difference in an actual G-sync module chip compared to g-sync compatible.

56842,"Hi everyone,

I've been looking into the samsung odyssey G7 series of monitors. However I have some questions regarding this monitor. Since this monitor is not cheap I want to be as thorough as possible. Anyway, far as I can see its has two models produced one being Samsung Odyssey G7 C32G75TQSUX and the other being Samsung Odyssey G7 LC32G75TQSUXEN now the question I have is whats the difference between the C32 model and the LC32 is one better than the other is the other one newer and so on, is there much of a difference between these two and should I pay attention to this. I can imagine the diffrence is that one model is a from a different factory production line however im not sure about this. So if anyone could clarify which these I should get or whats the difference I would apreciate it greatly.

56845,"Need some help guys. I’m looking at picking up a Samsung g7 for gaming but  not sure if I should get the 27” or 32” 

Any suggestions? 

The sharpness loss in the 32” is what’s keeping me from getting the 32”

TIA"

56847,"What about the AOC24G2, I thought it was regarded as the best 1080p IPS 144hz monitor? How are the Acer or Viewsonic better ?"
56848,this list hasn’t been updated in ages. most monitors on here have had counterparts that replace the older ones for better prices.
56849,"I've had an LG 27GL83A-B since January and it's a great monitor. Unfortunately, in moving into an apartment, it got dropped and the panel is cracked. Where can I get a replacement panel for it?"
56850,"Looking to purchase a 144hz monitor at 1440p, upgrading from a 60hz at 1080p.

With Prime Day sales going on, I really need some input choosing between:

&#x200B;

LG 27GL83A-B

ASUS TUF VG27AQ

Gigabyte M27Q

&#x200B;

afaik they are all G-Sync compatible (which is a criteria) and are similar but I wanted to see what others had to say that might make one edge over the other whether it be looks, space occupation, personal experiences with monitor, etc. Thanks!"
56851,"Can anyone recommend a monitor that has the following specs? I play a lot of Red Dead 2 on an Nvidia RTX 2060 and want an upgrade from my MSI 24'' 1080p monitor. I don't really play games competitively but a low latency is still preferred.

1440p
30-34 inches
HDR ready
1-4ms 
Curved screen, preferably 1000r or 1500r. (I have 1800r right now in a 24 inch)

Around $450-500 CAD.

These are two I've been contemplating. Any opinions on whether this would be good for gaming?
