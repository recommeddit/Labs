66143,"Pelé's Santos only won two Libertadores, mind.

Peñarol won it three times in the sixties and beat Real Madrid and Benfica in the Intercontinental Cup back when european teams cared about it.

Independiente (Agüero's childhood club) won it SEVEN times, and four of those were in consecutive years on the seventies.

South American football has a great history, sadly we started selling our best players to europe and then we never looked back... I would give anything to see the kind of teams that my dad told me about."
66144,"Well they also won two intercontinental cups, 6 league titles and 10 Sao Paolo state championships, not too shabby"
66145,"Yeah, more than my club ever did in any case :P"
66146,"Milan 20-25 years ago. Against them, Pep's Barcelona would have had something like 70-80% ball possession without ever managing to shoot on goal, considering their defence and Pep's obsession with never shooting from outside the box."
66147,"This may be true since we know Chelsea managed to get a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou, then we all know what happened at Stamford Bridge, fuck I shouldn't remind myself"
66148,"Celtic's team of 1966-67 was pretty good. They won all five competitions they entered that season, including the European Cup, scoring a record 196 goals in the process."
66149,"Iirc it was an all-Glasgow team as well, what makes it even more impressive."
66150,"Well, all but one of the European Cup final team were born within 15 miles of Celtic Park. The other was born 30 miles away."
66151,Heart of Midlothian FC's current squad
66152,Barcelona under Pep. Never saw anything like that and I've been watching football since 1998.
66153,"I have also not watched anything before mid 90s. This Barca team was amazing, no doubt about it. It is so interesting to see how it develops though, and how many times I've been thinking that this must be the best team i have ever seen (United 1999 and 2008, Milan 2005, Barcelona with Pep and Ronaldinho, Bayern 2013, Arsenal invincible, Galasticos). I wonder who the next team that blows my mind will be."
66154,"[Ajax starting XI of the 1995 CL final](https://timhi.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/ajax.png)

Substitutes: Fred Grim, Winston Bogarde, Nwankwo Kanu, Patrick Kluivert, Peter van Vossen"
66155,What a team!
66156,"I think you got the wrong pic mate, Kluivert is a starter on this one. Replace him with Seedorf and you have the right team i think.

                 Sar

   Reiziger - Blind - Rijkaard - De Boer

      Seedorf - Litmanen - Davids

      Finidi - De Boer - Overmars"
66157,Oh you're right. I googled Ajax CL final 1995 starting XI and I missed that. Thanks for pointing out.
66158,I love this start up. Was Ronald De Boer really that good? I do not remember that much from him. What kind of a player was he?
66159,"Very technical and extremely versatile. He could play as a midfielder, winger and striker and was more or less equally good on all positions.
He had a knack for smart runs into the opposites penaltybox as well."
66160,Sounds like Thomas Müller =) Maybe not the kind of player you recognize to much when you are young.
66161,Kinda but not really. De Boer had more playmaking skills whereas Müller is a better poacher. But i see your point and his name springs first to mind when i try to make a comparison with a active player.
66162,He's actually right in that pic. Ajax played 343 in the final.
66163,"But Kluivert wasn't a starter. Rijkaard played as a DM/CB like he always did in his last Ajax spell.

EDIT: Found this site: https://timhi.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/ajax-1995/ You can see OP's pic as well as the tactics when Ajax played Milan in the CL group stage of the 94-95 season. We played them 3 times that season, won all 3 of them. So maybe that's where the confusion comes from?"
66164,"I don't have a direct answer to this question as I was born in 96 and therefore missed a load of great teams. But I want to question Barca's place as the 'best club team ever'. What they do was amazing, I cannot deny but their longevity wasn't all there. 

In their 2009-2010 season they didn't win any other major award except for la liga title. And their reign in the league and europe ended after the 2012 season. So it was a Barca team from 2008-2011, where as you can compare that to Milan from 89-94 who got to FIVE european finals, where as Barca *only* got to two.

Imo if their span lasted a while longer they would have a bigger case, but I see the main reason of them popping up in these type of threads and and as a answer to the question is that they are the best team in recent times."
66165,"Real Madrid '55-'60
Ajax '70-'74 (ish)
Bayern '74-'76
Milan '88 - '95
Barcelona '09-'12

That's my top 5."
66166,Milan 89'-94'
66167,"The Ajax squad in 1965-1973 was incredible with Cruyff, Suurbier, Vasović, Swart and Keizer. 

Also the milan side 87-94 deserves a mention with the likes of Van Basten, Baresi, Rijkaard, Donadoni, Maldini, Tassotti and Ruud Gullit."
66168,"I will also bring up another team that i absolutely loved watching. The problem is that they managed to give away a 3-0 lead in a CL final.

Dida - Cafu, Nesta, Stam, Maldini - Pirlo, Seedorf, Gattuso, Kaka - Crespo, Sjevtsjenko

They used to play with a diamond on the midfield, as far as i remember. I think every player on this team was absolutely world class."
66169,Who does people think will be the best team in the world 3 years from now?
66170,Honestly? If Simeone is able to teach young kids then Atletico. Real seem to be losing their grip and Barca needs younger players since Messi sadly can't play forever.
66171,"Well Liverpool obviously!

*ducks to avoid all the shit flinging to come*"
66172,Barca 2009-2012 - best team in history of football
66173,Why to 2012? They lost the league that season and was no where near as good as they were in previous seasons..
66174,2012 is often used as a cut off because then it's clear people are talking about Pep Guardiola's Barca.  You are right though.
66175,"Why the downvotes, hard to argue against it imo"
66176,It's pretty easy to argue against it..Milan 89-94..
66177,"I'm not saying that that Milan team isn't worthy, 3x European Cups (champions league) in 5 years is something that's almost impossible to do, Barca is close with 2x Cups in 3 years.

But in my honest opinion 2009-2011 Barca would break any team 

Xavi Iniesta in their prime, that was just scary"
66178,"Either Skunthorpe or Ipswitch, truly hallowed teams, inspiring players to get as far away from them as possible"
66180,Fantastic team. They never won anything in Europe though.
66182,"Well, not winning the biggest trophy available is a pretty massive fault when talking about the best club team ever..."
66183,"The football they played though, is still one of the best i have ever seen. Even as a United fan i couldn't do anything else then painfully enjoy it."
66184,Not even close.
66185,"Im not sure if it is the best through all times, but what a team this was in 2008: 

Van der Saar 
- Evra, Vidic, Ferdinand, Brown
- Hargreaves, Scholes, Carick
- Tevez, Ronaldo, Rooney

Edit: Haha, ever since i started writing positive comments on United i got down voted. Probably i would get down voted suggesting that SAF was a good manager."
66186,It's not that it's about Man Utd... That team just doesn't compare to plenty others. I can think of atleast 20 teams that were better.
66187,"They had Tevez and Rooney who would chase the ball around the entire pitch if they had to. Carick had IMO the best season in his life. Scholes was Scholes. Hargreaves also brought so much with him into the team this season, specially with his pace. The defense was probably the best in Europe at this moment. Ronaldo could win games on his own. And the counter-attacks with Ronaldo,Tevez and Rooney was almost unstoppable. 

I agree it was not the best team ever, but i think they would be able to give play evenly and even win against all of the teams mentioned in this thread."
66189,I would actually put it the other way around; some of these players were stadouts but the *whole* team played some beautiful football from time to time.
66190,"Not even close to be honest. Barcelona from 2009 was much, much better. AC Milan 89-94. Liverpool in the 70's and 80's. Plenty of better teams."
66191,"3 Italian

66197,You seem to have forgotten that teams also compete in domestic competitions...
66198,"I haven't forgotten it, but your poll was entirely about how teams competed solely in Europe not domestically too. If this was about having the most trophies in history then Rangers and Celtic would hold the top two spots."
66199,"Yes, let's do it this way."
66200,"Where do you see that in the words ""all time top European clubs""? It just means the top teams in Europe over all of football history, taking everything (including the strength of the competition etc.) into account."
66201,"European success holds a lot more weight than domestic success though, and they usually correlate, so the list wouldn't change that much"
66202,"Dude, just stop."
66203,Is the OP not allowed to explain what they meant to say?
66204,I took it the way that guy said as well. It was most definitely implied that way.
66205,He is so clearly talking about European/International trophies.
66206,Why would you only care about European trophies? Nottingham Forest isn't on anybody's all-time list just because they've won as many European Cups as Juventus.
66207,"Because he thinks we are discussing the best teams in European compeitions... It is very clear that is the angle he is discussing. He's not saying you shouldn't care about domestic trophies. He's saying here is a ranking of teams performances *in Europe* based solely on their European/International trophy haul.

You are reading something into this that he is not saying."
66208,"I'm just trying to point out that he has completely misunderstood the point of the poll, and is trying to list the ""correct"" ranking based on a wrong interpretation of the entire post."
66209,It's apparent that almost everyone misunderstood your poll. All discussion in this thread is based on European success and the voting seems to align with that for the most part as well.
66210,"Maybe that's because the teams that won the most European trophies are also generally the most successful domestically, and had the best players and managers?

In any case, people who think that Barcelona weren't a major club pre-1992 (because they only won 6 European trophies until then) should take the time to read about László Kubala, Helenio Herrera, Luis Suárez Miramontes, Sándor Kocsis, Johan Cruijff, Rinus Michels, Udo Lattek, and Diego Maradona..."
66211,I would like to know who refused to pick Real Madrid as one of their top five.
66212,Egyptians
66213,You'd be surprised at the amount of Egyptian real supporters. Then the amount of Egyptian real supporters who defended ramos
66214,This UCL final must have been a roller coaster for them
66215,That'll change soon.
66216,"Look, it's 5%. That's just people that are mad. What I want to know is who the 30% are who didn't pick AC Milan."
66217,More people who are mad.
66218,Too many mad people. Most are indifferent about AC Milan.
66219,New fans
66220,Definitely new fans. I honestly wouldn’t have put them if I wasn’t reminded by seeing them on the list.
66221,So about the same as the people who picked Juventus and Inter?
66222,Surprised to see Barca rank that high.
66223,Think about the primary demographic of this sub (the voting base). Barca has had their best years during this wave of football fans' lifetimes. It makes a lot of sense when you think about who was voting on this.
66224,"Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United have really captured this generation's attention. It's no wonder they're the wealthiest clubs and largest brands in the sport."
66225,how high do you think they should be?
66226,They should be third behind AC Milan in all honesty. Recency bias is very flattering.
66227,"Why you say that? Comparing Barca's european titles vs Milan the difference isn't that great and Barcelona as always being stronger locally that Milan ever was. Barca even as more socis that Milan ever dreamed of. 

I'm not saying one is on top of the other but I don't think is as cut and dry as you make it out to be."
66228,"Tbf Milan european success is so widespread that to me puts them above us. It's not like Bayern, us or Liverpool that capitalized on a great era. They did capitalize a great era, but were able to pull it off diferent times with diferent teams and diferent players. Were as the rest of us is more the result of an historic core that did the bulk."
66229,Yeah I think Barca is bigger than Milan. I think Bayern vs Barca is a more interesting argument.
66230,"Yes, Liverpool and Juve too. Of course ManU is up there too."
66231,"So 3 instead of 2.

It is not that far off to be honest, considering the bias."
66233,"I'd say third or fourth. To me they're about as big as Liverpool or Bayern, but the success in the past ten years or so obviously ups their standing internationally."
66234,"I can understand someone thinking Bayern are above us. Not Liverpool. And even then, I can't see why Bayern should be higher."
66235,"Agreed on Liverpool, not so sure about Bayern."
66236,"Bayern have more CL finals than you, the same number of wins, and more league titles. There isn't really a metric where Barca are ahead of Bayern.

As for us, we both have 8 CL finals, 5 CL wins, and you have 7 more league titles, so I get why you'd be ahead of us. 

You're not ahead of Bayern though, not yet anyway."
66237,Are we ignoring the Copa del Rey as a major trophy? Barcelona have 30 of those...
66238,You say that as though Liverpool don't have FA cups and Bayern don't have DFB's. I'd say domestic knockout tournaments aren't as important or as difficult to win as leagues or champions leagues.
66239,"You have half the number of FA cup wins as we do for the Copa. That's a substantial difference, even if it is less prestigious than CL/league wins."
66240,Except we have much thougher competition domestically and we have more wins in the rest of european cups. Also our history of succes starts much before Bayern who were playing in the lower divisions after we were losing against Benfica an european final.
66241,">Except we have much thougher competition domestically


no, no you do not"
66242,"Bayern Munich don't have to face Real Madrid in the Bundesliga. Historically there were other strong teams in the Bundesliga like Gladbach once upon a time, and Hamburg for a while, but nowadays it is only really Dortmund and they're a far cry from the team which won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012."
66243,"ah i missunderstod, i thought you were talking about the premier league"
66244,If you're going on tougher domestic competition historically and more European wins overall then we're ahead of you surely?
66245,"Behind Madrid, Milan, and Bayern"
66246,I'd still put Barcelona above Bayern Munich.
66248,This sub is primarily American Barcelona fans
66249,The average r/soccer user is an American Manchester Utd fan actually.
66250,"And you are an americal rm fan that whines and disagrees with everyone on r/realmadrid.

Almost as bad as american barca fans"
66251,"Not an American fan and don't whine and disagree with everyone one on r/realmadrid.  

What are you on about"
66252,"Too many Barcelona fans, and too many ignorant of the club's history."
66253,Yea it's obviously 1. Real 2. PSG 3. Barça /s
66254,RMA and Milan should be 100% at 1 and 2.
66255,United over Liverpool? I missed them winning 3 UCLs more last night or something?
66256,To be fair though if it was just a list of who won the most CLs then there'd be no point to this. It's about perception and Liverpool's relatively dry last few years have shaped that. Same reason Barca are so high. I imagine too United winning the treble could be used as an example of something they have over Liverpool
66257,Do you think if we won the other night the vote would have been different? I wonder how much that would have changed the general public perception.
66258,I think so and equally if you had lost to City in the quarters I don't think it would be as close
66259,"Meh, 2 more UCLs is far more important than just 2 more leagues. If this is going to ignore that and try to justify it with mental gymnastics then it just a popularity contest, and we all know which English team wins on that."
66260,By your logic Aston Villa should be ahead of Chelsea. More recent success obviously has a great impact on this.
66261,"But Chelsea have won the CL? Villa haven't won more than them. A more appropriate comparison would be you saying Villa should be ahead of Man City, which would be pretty much correct, Aston Villa are the bigger club"
66262,"Villa won the European Cup, CL’s predecessor. They also won the league more times."
66263,I know
66264,So what’s your point? We shouldn’t be ranking clubs based only on how many times they won the CL.
66265,You need more consistency to win a league than a knockout competition.
66266,"that is irrelevant because Liverpool has leagues too, and just 2 less than you. And no, not winning it in a long time doesn’t change that. How long was United without winning one between the Holy Trinity and Ferguson? 25 years?"
66267,"By the same logic Liverpool winning two more CLs is irrelevant as well, as United has CLs too, just two less than Liverpool."
66268,"How dense can you be? It's all time top European clubs, not all time top clubs to have won most UCLs."
66269,"United haven't exactly dominated the league either, they're only 2(?) ahead of us in terms of league titles. Its nip and tuck between the two teams in every metric, its just that United have seen more recent success that many people view them as the far more successful team, the reality is its neck and neck. We've done more in Europe, United have done more domestically, and of course they have the proper treble on their side."
66270,"Yes, I concur that they're neck and neck."
66271,"So why would you call someone dense for suggesting that Liverpool should be head of United? There's perfectly legitimate arguments on both sides, and UCL wins is one of the strongest arguments for Liverpool."
66272,"Because the parent comment had an implication as if United being ahead of Liverpool was some sort of an anomaly, and the only criteria that is relevant is the number of CLs won by the respective clubs."
66273,"Jesus easy man, they where a powerhouse in Europe about 40 years ago, only recently getting back into the swing of this , it’s not that audacious to think they are a better European team then united. But yeah he’s wrong"
66274,"I think Barca should be 4th at the most, behind Munich and Milan."
66275,"This ranking isn't based on actual trophy amounts or anything, just fan votes from this subreddit."
66276,"I would add Liverpool to that.

So max 5th."
66277,"Don't know about that. Bayern, Liverpool and Barca all have 5 CL titles. Bayern have reached 10 finals, the other 2 have reached 8. Barca have made finals in 5 decades: 1960's, 1980's, 1990's, 2000's and 2010's. Liverpool in 4: 1970's, 1980's, 2000's and 2010's. In terms of spread, Barca wins. 

Guess it depends on whether you value CWC (edit: Cup Winner's Cup) over UEFA Cup. Idk. Barca made 6 CWC finals winning 4, Liverpool 4 UEFA Cup finals winning 3, plus a solitary CWC final loss."
66278,"Barcelona won the Cup Winners' Cup 4 times, no other team has managed to more than twice. This would definitely factor in when discussing European pedigree or dominance in general.  

Liverpool won the UEFA Cup 3 times, which was a joint-record until Sevilla won their 4th in 2015. Had they beaten Sevilla in 2016, they would both have 4 trophies in that competition.  

The Cup Winner's Cup was definitely a higher tier of competition than the UEFA Cup before it got absorbed into it. I'd personally rank Barcelona over Liverpool based on that alone, putting domestic dominance aside (where they'd still be above Liverpool)."
66279,"> The Cup Winner's Cup was definitely a higher tier of competition than the UEFA Cup 

Was it? I don't think it was at all."
66280,"Given that the European Cup was EC1, the Cup Winners' Cup was EC2, and the UEFA Cup was EC3... and the fact that you could only get into the UEFA Cup if you failed to qualify for both the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup?"
66281,"I suppose it's a bit vague

> UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition, behind the European Cup (later the UEFA Champions League) and ahead of the Fairs Cup (later the UEFA Cup). Therefore, a team qualified for both the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the European Cup, whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the Cup Winners' Cup. Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded the Cup Winners' Cup as weaker than the UEFA Cup, which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues."
66282,"On a podcast the other day, the Totally Football guys casually mentioned the Cup Winner's Cup as being the third ranking European trophy of the time."
66283,"And that's just their opinion. I don't know how they can rank it below the UEFA Cup if the UEFA Cup was literally a tier below it according to UEFA themselves. It's easier to dismiss it now that it doesn't actually exist anymore, but plenty of giant-killings happened in that competition. Real Madrid lost to Chelsea and Aberdeen in the Cup Winners' Cup, it's the only European trophy we've never won."
66284,"I'm not arguing with you, just adding the perspective of some guys who were old enough to remember the competition from a podcast I happened to listen to yesterday.. I was born in 92, so I can't pretend like I have memories or experience to speak from on the matter."
66285,I was also born in 1992. I don't have memories from pre-Premier League and Champions League either.
66286,"18 league titles and 5 European cups (Liverpool), 25 league titles and 5 European cups (Barca). They have us beat by 7 league titles, which is a lot."
66287,I wouldn't.
66288,"Why? We're as succesful as them in terms of trophies and actually our history is better spread than Bayern and equally compared to Liverpool. People forget we were very succesful in Europe in the pre Europe Cup era. And that we were the cursed team when it came to that tournament for decades, in the same sense as Atlético can be seen now. 

Putting them before us it's just romantazing the fact that they won their UCL before us. 

EDIT: I thought you were talking about Liverpool instead of Milan, of course Milan are above us."
66289,"I have Barcelona above Bayern Munich in every metric. Even if you factor in domestic dominance, Barcelona have more domestic trophies compared to Bayern, and it can't be ignored that they won the treble twice."
66290,"To me it's more that Bayern's success starts in the late 60's as opposed to us, we have been always a top team. Even if we won the European League much later than them, we were playing european finals when they were in the lower divisions."
66291,I'm not disagreeing with any of that. I said that I considered Barcelona to be the higher ranked club.
66292,"I know, I were just exposing my opinion on why we should be ahead."
66293,Where's Arsenal
66295,Look at Arsenal's continental honours.
66296,Never had a manager tactically astute enough to guide them through to the latter stages of the Champions League on multiple occasions when they were consistently qualifying for the competition.
66297,"Ironically, I actually think Wenger was at his best in Europe during the barren period."
66298,"*only one European trophy, cup winners cup, like us"
66299,"Arsenal won the Cup Winners' Cup, same as Manchester City... if you're going to discredit theirs, you should also discredit yours."
66300,They've won two European trophies - the 1969-70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 1993-94 Cup Winners' Cup.
66301,We have mate
66302,You're about to get a lot of replies about what a massive trophy the cup winners cup was.
66303,Wasn't it considered the second most prestigious European trophy?
66305,"Barca are insanely high for a team which won there first in 1992, then again they have won a good few recently so its hard to argue. Liverpool being behind Utd baffles me honestly, i cant even make a case for it"
66306,Is it purely based on CL performance? Liverpool haven't won the league for over the last 25 years. Also United being the only English club to have won the proper treble.
66307,"Bollox I thought it was just CL, makes a lot more sense then"
66308,"Yeah I was thinking about this a lot when it was posted and I honestly think we should just be joint rated at this point.

 You have more trophies and some great moments like Istanbul, but we have the only English treble and more recent success.

I think a joint rating would be the most fair"
66309,"Yeah joint rated is most accurate. League titles you guys lead 20-18, Liverpool lead champions leagues 5-3, fa cups united are ahead 12-7, uefa cup/europa league is Liverpool 3-1 and the league cup is Liverpool 8-5. So according to that both sides have 41 major trophies apiece. United jump ahead when you include Community Shield as its 17-10 in those but whether or not thats a major trophy is up for debate.

Seems ive misread the community shield records. It is 21-15 overall."
66310,"I meant more in Europe. Personally I'd say we're ahead domestically atm, but I am also biased."
66311,I was just talking in general really. Liverpool are definitely the more successful team in Europe for sure. United have nudged ahead domestically though
66312,"> i cant even make a case for it

I wouldn't go that far even if I agree that Liverpool should be higher. United being more prominent in recent years, winning a treble, being the first english team to win it and the romance of the Busby Babes are all things which might sway voters"
66313,Why? You haven’t won a league in 25 years or a significant trophy in 12.
66314,"28 years now, they last won the league in 1990."
66315,"But this list is an all-time list, so therefore do we take into account the years in the 70’s/80’s where our roles were basically reversed? Think the question asked is abit too open"
66316,"He said he can’t make a case for it, I was just making my case."
66317,"While true, his response was to the the parent commenter who essentially stated that ""Liverpool being behind Utd baffles me honestly, I can't even make a case for it."""
66318,Is that relevant in an all-time list?
66319,"Of course it is. The modern era is much harder now and there’s more elite clubs, so when a team manages to dominate the said era they’re gunna be remembered more fondly."
66320,"No doubt they will be remembered more fondly just because they have achieved success recently. Nobody is doubting that.

But that wasn't the question was it?"
66321,Milan should be ahead of Barca and Bayern
66322,"I'm obviously biased, but I figured we'd just about scrape the top 5, at least in the all-time list. Recent years obviously haven't been so kind."
66323,bayern shouldn't be in front of milan.
66324,Why do you think so?
66325,"Dunno, I just think it's bigger club. They've got more european success, more legendary players and i think it's more attractive destination for footballers if they aren't in this sad state they're currently at."
66327,"So far - Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain, Werder Bremen, Celtic, Galatasaray, Austria Wien, Tottenham Hotspur, Wycombe Wanderers, 1. FC Köln, Valencia, Sporting CP, Newcastle United, and Hashtag United."
66328,I'm surprised that no one voted for Porto in the Other category. They have more European trophies than Benfica and are only about 5-6 trophies behind them domestically (unless you only count the major ones like the league and cup).
66329,Because Porto is there as a choice? It is only 7 votes behind benfica.
66330,"Yeah, but Benfica also has 5 Champions League finals and 3 Uefa League finals lost.  
Porto won basically every chance they got."
66331,Hashtag United got some votes.
66332,United 5th.  Why exactly r/soccer?
66333,"1. Real Madrid  
2. AC Milan  
3. Bayern Munchen  
4. Barcelona  
5. Ajax  
6. Liverpool  
7. Manchester United  
8. Juventus  
9. Inter  
10. Benfica  

Don't call me biased for being a United fan. I recognize Liverpool should be higher than United. I just can't agree on them being higher than Barcelona and Ajax. 

People love to say Ajax became irrelevant, but let's not act like Liverpool's fluke win in 2005 means they're more relevant. Especially considering how they're performing in the league. 

In my opinion, they're (considering Barcelona here too) big clubs not just for performances on the pitch, but also what they produced in terms of style of football. I think Ajax and Barcelona make a case far more than Liverpool do. 

This might be a bit morbid, but Liverpool's impact in negative ways should also kind of be considered. Looking at the history and seeing Liverpool being the cause for a 5 year ban for English clubs, to me that impacts their stance on this list. 

It makes me want to put Liverpool just below the top 5. Them wining 5 CL's, though, and the lost finals, it does put them ahead of United for me. That's more important from a ""Europe"" perspective, their one league they have over Liverpool makes it irrelevant and recently in Europe, it's hard to put United over Liverpool. 2005 and 2008 being close to each other, 2007 and 2009 as well, and then 2011 and 2018 of course. Cameo appearence from United in 2017 which shouldn't be completely ignored. This all against the argument that Liverpool have fallen off over the years."
66335,ManU b4 Liverpool Hmm...
66336,is this meant to be purely based on european achievements? if so i dont see why juve are so much higher than inter lol
66337,"Juventus is 5th in the European Cup + Champions League all time table. Inter is 13th. 

http://www.worldfootball.net/alltime_table/champions-league/"
66338,"That metric there doesn't make any sense, since it's based on number of games played, which nobody uses to judge european success. I mean, that table put us 3 positions below a team that has a CWC as their only european trophy..."
66339,"...except it's not. It's ranked by total points, like you know, every single table ever."
66340,"but then again, nobody uses this as a metric for a reaseon. Or are you suggesting really that Arsenal is a better european club with simply one CWC then the next three clubs from the table that have respectively 3, 1 and 3 again champions leagues(and i'm not even counting the other cups)?"
66341,"It shows which teams actually are regulars in the biggest club competition in the world. It shows which teams survive long enough in the competition to get all those points and goals. 

It shows that Juventus often qualify for the tournament, make a deep run while consistently outscoring their opponent. It shows that although Inter have won it 3 times, they haven't been making deep runs in the tournament as often as Juventus. It shows that while Inter's success have come mainly from 2 eras, they quite frankly haven't been successful in the competition for as many decades/eras as Juve. 

For Arsenal specifically, I really don't think it's that far fetched to see them so highly."
66342,"I know what it shows, but then again why do you think nobody uses this method to judge clubs? And i'm not even talking about Inter vs Juve, i confronted us with Arsenal, and you think they are a better european club than us or Ajax? If you want to talk Juve, that same table puts them above Milan which is the second club beyond Real Madrid for CL wins. Nobody, and i mean nobody, would suggest that Juve is a better european club than Milan, but that table suggests exactly that."
66343,Barcelona is too high this is all time not last two decades.
66344,"I'd say they're maybe one spot too high, not too big of a deal, especially when you consider that there's a strong recency bias towards them. In addition, they're the only club to have done the treble twice IIRC, which is a pretty big achievement in itself"
66345,"Barcelona are third in the European Cup + Champions League all time table. Yes, most of their success has been during the last two decades but they have been one of the giants of football for a very long time. 

http://www.worldfootball.net/alltime_table/champions-league/"
66346,"Ajax, Juve, Inter, Liverpool, Real IMO. I did it from a mostly historical standpoint; Barcelona and United’s periods of immense success are relatively recent (past 30 years) though they have always been big clubs."
66347,Is that the order you're ranking them in?
66348,I cannot decide on a single order except Real being unequivocally first. I think it’s pretty difficult to rank them definitively other than by counting trophies
66349,"I agree with the list, I'd only put Milan over Barça and thats all."
66350,"Is there any way to vote for multiple teams in the ""Other"" category? It wouldn't let me submit unless I checked five boxes, but I only wanted to check three. Ended up selecting Porto and Milan and making a comment to disregard them"
66351,Do a global one
66352,"I would like to, but I'm 99% sure that teams like Boca Juniors, Peñarol, River Plate, and Nacional wouldn't even make the top 15, due to the European bias this sub has."
66353,Could you do one for non-European teams? I agree with you though
66354,"For the same reason, a poll with only non-European clubs probably wouldn't get enough attention to be worth doing."
66355,Ehh it's worth a try
66356,I've posted [a poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8nl4wr/daily_discussion_20180531/dzwa6tm/) onto today's Daily Discussion thread.
66357,"Independiente, Boca Juniors, São Paulo, Santos and Peñarol for me. What do you think?"
66358,I'm surprised Liverpool aren't being trashed in this thread.
66359,">""When you mistake *all-time* with *since I started watching football* top European clubs"
66360,Manchester United should be below Juventus and Liverpool FOR SURE
66361,How are we below United
66362,More recent success and also the treble + first English side to win. I’d say they’re equal.
66363,Because Redditors don't tend to know anything about football history from pre-2013 and YouTube highlights
66364,"If you want to compare this versus what teams have actually won in a visual format, compare it with an interactive visualisation I made at http://www.thebigclubs.com.

It is updated for all this seasons league and European wins!

The relevant filter to press would probably be “Dynasty” mode for a like for like with OP’s poll."
66365,"Imo 

Real Madrid
AC Milan
Bayern Munich
Liverpool
Ajax"
66366,No Barcelona in your rankings?
66368,"Have you never heard of Cruyff's Dream Team of the early 90s? Trust me, they were plenty dominant before 2000."
66369,He is clueless and he is everywhere on this subreddit
66370,"Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern, Barca, Liverpool should be the correct order"
66371,Barca 2nd?? Pfff.
66372,"If you take into account all the European trophies which include:
 
* UCL Champions League
* UEL	Europa League
* CWC      Cup Winners' Cup (defunct)
* UIC	Intertoto Cup (defunct)
* USC	Super Cup
* IC	        Intercontinental Cup (defunct)

Then the clubs with the most trophies are:

1. Real Madrid with 22

2. AC Milan with 17

3. Barcelona with 14

4. Liverpool with 11


5. Juventus with 11


6. Bayern Munich with 10

7. Ajax with 10

8. Internazionale with 8

9. Manchester United with 7


10. Porto with 7 


11. Atlético Madrid with 7


12. Sevilla with 6

16. Feyenoord with 4

17. Hamburger SV with 4

18. Parma with 4

19. Nottingham Forrest with 3 

20. Borussia Dortmund with 3 



That's 5 Spanish teams, 4 Italian teams, 4 English Teams, 3 German Teams, 2 Dutch teams, 1 Portuguese team and 1 Belgian team in the official top 20. 



I'm really surprised that Benfica is so high in the /r/soccer list considering, they didn't even make the top 20, with 2 European trophies.  

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UEFA_club_competition_winners)"
66373,"Benfica has been to 7 European cup/CL finals and 3 UEFA cup/Europa league finals \(not to mention national cups where we lead comfortably in every list of conquests\). Benfica's European success starts in the 60's way before most clubs in that titles list, wether you like it or not it is one of the classic great teams of Europe and that's what this thread is all about: all\-time top European clubs."
66374,"Should be Madrid, Milan, Liverpool \(as we all know if the English teams weren't banned they'd have most likely a few more CLs\) Bayern, Barca."
66375,"On paper: No way in hell we are this far down, look at these players we have.

On the pitch: Damn, we actually this high up?"
66376,Jogi Low has Merkel's nudes. No other way he's still the NT coach.
66377,">Jogi Low has Merkel’s nudes

And her haircut."
66378,"He's sitting on a weapon of mass destruction, hopefully he's sensible enough to never use it."
66379,Don't let him grow a moustache!
66380,Perfect place to hide the arse scratch smells
66381,He's taken Germany to a new Löw.
66382,No one can know about her mammoth cock.
66383,"You know that nudes of Merkel exist, right?"
66384,I almost don't dare to ask but could you give some more info on that?
66385,It's nothing in a erotic way. Just a casual picture of her and some other students enyoing a sauna or something like that. Nothing terrible but also nothing worth searching on bing. But enough to confirm that the mammoth cock rumours are false.
66386,Whoah a bing user
66387,is that the lake photo from when she was in her 20's?
66388,Yeah.
66389,That's a fake
66390,England but opposite
66391,How the fuck are we still up in 13th lol?
66392,How is germany so low??
66393,Replace the o in low with an ö and you know why lol
66394,I didnt knöw that he's such a bad coach tbh
66395,"He has been horrendous since 2018. Before that he was quite alright, but I think that was more thanks to the Bayern core that he could rely on. NT managers cannot make as much of an impact on the field due to time, so their selection is crucial. And his selection of players sucks. He's just not getting fired because the DFB is a corrupt nepotistic douchebag clan who are all in bed with each other and think they're tough sh*t because they get to choose some of the best players in the world and think it's part of their achievement that these guys are so good."
66397,"They were poor against Italy, but the performance was overshadowed by Zaza memes"
66398,"""Quite alright"" = winning the world cup? 

You Germans are spoiled!"
66399,LÖW MUST WEG.
66400,You're not kevin
66401,He also wrote it wrong
66402,They should sack löw or else Germany will be out of top 50
66403,When's your mixtape dropping?
66404,"Soon bro, it’s gonna be lit. I already have a single release and the feedback is great. You might want to check out the video clip on YouTube :)

https://youtu.be/vVn-n_6PW50"
66405,They haven't been playing well in recent years
66406,Major International competitions is the main determinate in the rankings so because they flopped in the world cup they dropped and qualifiers and the nation's League isn't enough to take them back uo
66407,No way we’re top 20 tbh
66408,Any Belgian that wakes up from a 15 year coma would shit their pants when they see this
66409,I don’t get how they’re that high.
66410,Whats hard about it? Besides the (extremely painful) loss against France and the recent one against England we havent lost any games in a while. We were 3rd in the WC...
66411,Karma’s payback after the crazy win against Japan
66412,"And you think thats reasonable enough to be first? Im sorry but I don't think other national teams think ""oh shit we're playing against the number 1 national team"" when going against Belgium. Superb team nonetheless."
66413,"I’m not saying one could not argue the other in the top 5 to be better but the ranking is based on results and Belgium has a lot of good results. 


I dont think other teams ever think about these rankings but other teams are aware of what a good team Belgium is. Weird to say otherwise... We’ve beaten Brazil, England, France, Portugal in recent years. It’s not like it’s a coincidence we are top of the rankings and 3rd at the WC"
66414,"Because they perform amazingly in qualifiers. I don't think that should be enough to be first, at least winning a continental title in the last 4 years should be, but that's not how the ranking works. In any case, the ranking is a bit stupid, true number one is the world champ and that's it. Belgian supporters would rather be 20th and win a title than stay at the first rank for the next 10 years but without any trophy"
66415,Maybe because they’re really fucking good?
66416,"But not number 1 good, definitely top 5 though"
66417,Thanks Löw.
66418,Is Germany too... Low?
66419,Top 10 but we not 10 🇲🇽
66420,We can make it past the Rof16 soon! 🇲🇽🇶🇦2022!
66421,Ahuevo 💪🏼🇲🇽
66422,"How do you do, fellow elite national teams?"
66423,I expect Holland will rocket up the rankings in the near future.
66424,If only we had some good attackers
66425,"Yeah, no good attackers in the Netherlands. 100% agreed sentiment."
66426,"The fact that we still regularly have to watch De Jong and Babel in the national team with Weghorst just sitting at home is a fucking crime against football lol. He might not start every game because Depay is our best player when playing as a striker, but still. 

I definitely expected Weghorst when De Boer started trying a 3-5-2 . The formation really fits us. World class centerbacks, wingbacks that can't really defend, solid defensive mid and then Wijnaldum+De Jong behind Weghorst+Depay. Oh well.... here comes Babel again I suppose."
66427,"De Jong is a solid striker, he's just best used as a work horse who produces great headers. Not really what we need in Oranje, but he's a great attacker. Weghorst and Dost are in the same category. Depay is great, so if Gakpo, Boadu, Stengs or perhaps Ihattaren can step up and have a breakout tournament, we're fine."
66428,Maalen?
66429,I knew I forgot someone! Yeah Malen could be great for Oranje.
66430,Is false 9 Van de Beek possible? He was the de facto striker for 18-19 ajax run
66431,"Could be done, but no reason to. Depay will 100% play as a striker when possible. had around 30 G+A in 30 games since Koeman started using him as a striker and he is crucial to our attacking flow with his movement.

Plus we have a number of young talented strikers behind him (Boadu, Malen, Bergwijn). Personally I also prefer Van de Beek as a midfielder with late rushes into the box, he was always most effective in that position. Which makes his transfer to United so baffling since they have both Pogba and Bruno. shame he barely gets to play, but I completely understand Ole for playing Bruno as often as he can lol"
66432,"Nope, they're in qual group with Norway, the real upcoming rocket"
66433,"Norway could have Spain's golden generation and still not qualify for a tournament, they are massive bottlers"
66434,As is tradition
66435,It is in the history of the norway
66436,We're pretty good bottlers too tbh.
66437,"I think they need a new trainer for that. One superstar is not enough, that's why they didn't manage to get to the Euros."
66438,"Norway did get a new trainer, Ståle Solbakken, who coached FC Copenhagen for better part of a decade. And we got to see Haaland and Ødegaard really click at the end of Nations League. Netherlands is a good team though.

Also Haaland barely played in the EURO qualification campaign and we still drew Sweden twice and Spain once without him, while being the only team with an honourable result away in Spain (2-1)"
66439,Have switched coaches now! Solbakken should be a good fit
66440,How tf are Venezuela 28th?
66441,They beat the mighty Chile recently... which brings me to question how the fuck we (Chile) are ranked so highly in the first place having missed out on the last World Cup. We are living off the points from somehow making our way into the last Copa America's semi-final.
66442,"You also missed the world cup because our qualifiers are tough as fuck. Chile might be a top 20 team in the world.

And yes, the Copa América counts."
66443,"I hate Conmebol, man :("
66444,~~You~~ Colombia should have beaten us in Copa America. I feel we got lucky that match and Peru brought us back down to earth in semis.
66445,We did beat you! :)
66446,"I'm a dumbass, I confused the match against Uruguay with the one against Colombia."
66447,"We had a really defensive and organized team with our old manager, so we tied a lot with stronger teams like brazil and argentina and also did pretty good in friendlies (last being 4-0 against japan) then we lost 3 games in a row but beat chile so I guess that was enough to stay at 28."
66448,Thanks for the explanation ❤️🇻🇪
66449,"Dudamel, my babe, I miss u"
66450,We’re 9th?!?!? LETS GOO CABRONES!
66451,"Thanks for repping CONCACAF!  I know we have a rivalry, but one of us in the top 10 helps the region still."
66452,Respect ✌️
66453,"I think we've been 9th since the last one, let's keep those moleros coming!"
