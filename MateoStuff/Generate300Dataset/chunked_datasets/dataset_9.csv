2944,During covid when we were all work from home I set up my DSLR as my webcam for meetings and I got told to stop camera shaming people and go back to the shitty webcam in my laptop
2945,Camera shaming lmao
2946,"it became a distraction and people complained about it because other people kept asking about it but yes the words ""camera shaming"" were used ""/"
2947,"You could've just said ""I'll tell you later after the meeting""."
2948,"When you're interviewing for remote jobs, I'd want the best camera and microphone possible to create a good impression for their subconscious biases."
2949,"Ideally you'd want your camera to be as far away as possible too, for [narrow angle to make your face look as good as possible](https://steemitimages.com/p/3q52Dkr5nBe3i4rvL8ErWaBPivbAzVEW1d5toTzNWftCsaTNAx2bXWqhMiDYfywbnLgsw4mZPUYE2?format=match&mode=fit&width=1280). DSLR behind your monitor, zoomed in seems like a perfect tool for this."
2950,"Right, but that's even more niche, and the people who really want great quality will buy a dedicated webcam which will always be better than what can be put in a laptop."
2951,"> the people who really want great quality will buy a dedicated webcam

Yeah, this entire thread is about how desktop webcams still suck. Laptop webcams suck more, but being better than crappy doesn't make it good."
2952,"I mean, they don't though. https://www.amazon.com/Desktop-with110-Degree-Digital-Microphone-Recording/dp/B082CJPNB5

I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower. I sell these kinds of things all the time, usually people just check out a Logitech and see the good ones for $100 and think that's what they need to spend for something good, but cheap out and buy some unmarked thing. There's a middle ground, and they're perfect for video conferencing."

>I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower.

You linked to a webcam with a slow fixed focus 12mm equivalent lens and a sensor that I'm guessing is somewhere around 1/2.3"" Type if we're lucky (probably even smaller).

That is an example of a bad webcam, and the fact that you are seeing it as being an upgrade over most webcams further demonstrates just how bad webcams currently are. It may be sufficient for people's use cases, but that doesn't make it a good camera using modern technology.

The difference between that webcam (or the worse webcams you're upgrading people to that one from) and something like an Elgato Facecam (or one of the cheaper competitors without Elgato pricing) is night and day, and that's still not even a good camera. It's just better than most of the rest of the webcam market."
2954,Zoom compresses the shit out of your webcam feed anyway.
2955,"Zoom is ok, you seen Google Meet? Makes zoom look good in comparison."
2957,But those users rarely use build-in cameras. Even cameras by Red aren't an unusual thing on twitch.
2958,Right!?  I just got a new ultra book for work and it has a clearer wider shot.  I hate it!
2959,"Yeah, I don't care to see my colleagues at all. What I do care about is seeing the Power Point presentations very clearly. So, screen share is the only important thing to me."
2960,Give me a good microphone array over a good camera.
2961,Absolutely matters more now.
2962,I leave my camera off in zoom 90% of the time
2963,Oh cool
2964,"In the university I work at we use Zoom and people really don't care as as long as they can be seen and heard.

Same goes for good quality microphones."
2965,"In my university people don't even turn them on. They just use voice, but really they are browsing on their phones"
2966,Consumers care more about thin bezels and thin laptop lids.
2967,"Apple hasn't done it yet so the userbase's expectations of how a video call should look haven't improved. People just assume video conferencing looks this way because that's how it should look, so there's no demand for better integrated laptop webcams.

On the other hand, integrated microphones have been improving lately because people expect their voice to sound better nowadays because the audio in their phones have improved, especially as wireless headphones have become ubiquitous so the dinky phone earpiece isn't used as much anymore."
2968,"Off topic a bit, but on the topic of integrated microphones and audio quality on phones. 

Something that has been bothering me for a while now is radio commercials or radio shows that have a caller on the line or a recorded call that they play back. Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore. So why does the audio on these radio shows or commercials sound so terrible? Are they running it through a filter to “make it sound like someone is on the phone”? I know it’s not cause they don’t have good audio equipment, because all the hosts of the show or the main person in the commercial are crystal clear and are very clearly using professional audio equipment. My phone doesn’t sound like that when I’m making calls, so why does EVERY radio show or commercial with callers have callers that sound terrible."
2969,">Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore

So that's the gotcha. Landlines are still using the legacy frequency ranges we have used for a century. Additional digital compression may be added by the phone company and phone system the radio station is using as well. They may also filter some frequncies as well if they can be problematic like hiss or background hum.

HD voice sounds great on modern phones. But if you are not calling an HD voice enabled line, which is pretty much every landline, you are falling back to older cellular voice codecs, which are far heavier compressed then landlines. This could be as new as ones introduced with 3G in the 2000s, but Verizon for example, still falls back to the CDMA codecs they used in the mid-90s and was designed for 2G, and as a result, sound absolutely horrid.

So you are hearing the result of legacy cell phone compression, on top of landline compression, on top of radio station phone system compression. That may be genuinely what the phone call sounds line once it reaches their equipment."
2970,The issue is likely how they're recording the call. If they've still got analog lines or recorders it had a limited range of sound. Can compress it to hell too.
2971,"Apple actually has this thing called a “face time” and I know it’s hard to see, but if you look closely at your iPhone you’ll actually see a 12mp  webcam!

Seriously though, decent camera sensors alone aren’t cheap. Sony probably has a major market share and Logitech probably just buys the low end sensors from suppliers like them. People often think Logitech is a great company and sometimes they make nice toys but they’re ultimately low quality, nice looking, and convenient. They’re like the Bose of computer peripherals."
2972,they make the best pointing devices
2973,They make the best mouse features but they are not the best in pointing devices. Would have agreed with you a few years ago but the switch quality and power they run them at causes huge problems. If you really want to get into it start googling. Having click issues within a year of purchase is entirely avoidable but they won't do anything about it. Unfortunately Logitech is an empty shell of what they used to be
2974,">They’re like the Bose of computer peripherals.

Are they even as ""good"" as Bose?

I think of them more like, idk, skull candy where they're serviceable mass-market products that and cheap and also good enough for the average person."
2975,That's exactly what Bose is. Bose became popular because they're cheap enough and good enough for most people but not once have they ever been considered a worthwhile brand by anyone that enjoys audio as a hobby.
2976,"It depends on what you're looking for. I think it's unfair to compare them to Bose. Especially their mouse lineup is very serviceable for both gaming and productivity. Plus, their customer service is exceptional in the states at least. I used to have a mouse from a very ""gamer"" brand, but after the shitty product support and customer service, it'll take a lot for me to consider anything not Logi for mice."
2977,So what's a better noise cancelling headphones than the QuietComfort ? Because AFAIK those are what made Bose beyond famous.
2978,I believe that Sony has been beating Bose on noise-canceling with their WH line of headphones
2979,"I will look into that! 

My Bose QC cans in various generations have been saving my sanity since my globetrotting days started in 2009. At least three transoceanic trips a year. I do not know how people can stand eight plus hours of jet noise without a break."
2980,"The WH-1000XM4 was routinely listed as the best consumer-grade noise cancelling wireless headphones when I was shopping last year. I don't have a frame of reference with other headphones, but I'm pretty happy with my pair."
2981,I was looking at the XM3 earlier today for cost reasons and it seems the XM4 is not that much better. https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-vs-sony-wh-1000xm3-38479/
2982,Absolutely Sony blows Bose out of the water
2983,"Good point, I think I compared the two because they’re both often behind. Logi took a long time to release a mech keyboards that matched the features of their high end plastic frame and rubber dome keyboards; a lot of recent bose stuff doesn’t even natively support Bluetooth and their current lineup has incredibly minimal homekit features only recently got airplay and that’s probably only because their Bluetooth was so bad"
2984,"> ""consumers don't care""

yep, this is it. People don't give a fuck about quality until they actually *see* quality. But even then, they're not willing to pay for quality, even if they appreciate the difference.

""Why does your picture look so good?! How do you get your background blurred like that?""

[""Oh you know, I put some spare parts together ...""](https://geizhals.de/?cat=WL-1891480)

"".... I'l stick with my webcam, it's good enough""

""Sure, keep telling yourself that. lol"""
2985,"yeah, who doesn't have 3k of camera equipment lying around"
2986,"Okay, but using a G Master lens on a webcam setup is pretty ridiculous. You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens for the purposes of a webcam. Come on."
2987,"I know, I know. But the [ridiculousness is half the fun.](https://i.imgur.com/alPpAwX.png) : )

That, and people getting slightly annoyed how much better I look in meetings. lol

And *then* their faces when they ask what webcam I'm using and I show them that list. Pure bliss.

I just thoroughly enjoy doing the excessive opposite of what everybody else is doing.

Everybody is rocking shitty laptop webcams, barely above the GameBoy Camera? Of course I'm building an almost $4000 webcam you could shoot a movie on. Duh!

Everybody is wearing these tiny white apple earpods that look like you've got lollipop sticks stuck in your ear? You can bet your behind that I'm wearing [the most chunky, black, industrial looking headphones I can get my hands on](https://i.imgur.com/VdDaJF9.png) (Sennheiser RS 185, highly recommended wireless headphones!), just to see if someone reacts, and boy do they.

Anyway. That's my way of making these insufferable meetings a little bit more fun.

> You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens

Yeah, this is by no means a buying guide, this is just me being extravagant. ; )

If we're being reasonable, any shitty $300 point n shoot with HDMI-out would give you a complete package that could beat those laptop webcams without breaking a sweat. I just wanted to setup the most excessive webcam that I could with the parts that I already got.

I also tried a [Voigtländer Nokton 40mm 1.2](https://geizhals.eu/voigtlaender-nokton-40mm-1-2-for-sony-e-black-19665-a1705684.html), beautiful portrait lens with absurd DOF, but unfortunately my desk isn't deep enough for that focal length. I can barely get my face in frame but with a lens like that you really need some good amount of background to truly appreciate the bokeh rendering."
2988,This is also pretty much why TV speakers and AAA video games have been getting progressively worse over the years. :p
2989,That’s more so the AAA space has stagnated. Notice that 2016 was the last time a non third person action adventure had one goty. This year will probably be the first since to not have that genre win. As HFW is into 2022 now. So it’s Ratchet and clank vs halo FH5 and other third parties. Ratchets the only shoe In nominee for third person action adventure( ratchet and clank rift apart s is the bare minimum of a 3d platformer)
2990,"There hasn't been a good new RTS release since StarCraft 2 in 2010. And even that wasn't as good as the original as some of the Korean pros have gone back to StarCraft, the original."
2991,By new you mean new ip right? Because AOE has been good.
2992,"Why don't they care? Because streaming isn't very good still! Why would you get a 4K webcam, streaming is still gonna look like shit unless you have a hella WiFi package."
2993,"The best webcam I have ever owned is one I got back in like 2002. It had its own hardware encoder and image processor, with a big-ass sensor and lens, so even though it was only like 640x480 the image quality was far beyond all but the best today, 20 years later. Unfortunately they stopped supporting it and drivers stopped working when Windows 7 came out.

I would absolutely pay a good price for a good webcam, they just don't exist. Even the newer 4k ones may have decent sensors but everything else is poor, and for video conferencing (particularly large groups) resolution matters less than framerate, color accuracy, white balance, focus, etc."
2994,"I'm using a top-of-the-line webcam.

It's alright but nothing special (4K/30FPS).

One big issue I've found is that resolution is limited on videoconferencing services anyways, it ends up running in 720p.

The vast majority of people don't need more than plug-and-play 720p."
2995,"Precisely, 720p is fine, but I has to be a *good* 720p. Doesn't matter how sharp it is if the image still looks like shit."
2996,Everyone serious (like a twitch streamer) uses a DSLR camera with micro HDMI plugged into a USB capture card or directly into PCIe slot
2997,"While you're right that it is a bit of a solved problem in the $500+ price bracket, there really should be dramatically better options around the $200 price bracket and built into laptops than what we've been seeing.

A 1"" sensor with a decent readout speed and some relatively fast glass that isn't focus locked to infinity (can't believe webcam manufacturers ***still*** don't understand that people generally sit within a few metres of their webcams) isn't *that* much more expensive than a 1/5"" sensor, without even getting into the software issues that most of them have."
2998,"Yeah it's true but for cheaper just get a cheaper camera. I've seen old gopro, I think it was a hero 4, plugged in via some chince usb capture card (like it wasn't an expensive capture card, $20 max usb 2.0) and it worked fine, look much better than any 1080p logitec webcam"
2999,"> plugged in via some chince usb capture card (like it wasn't an expensive capture card, $20 max usb 2.0) and it worked fine, look much better than any 1080p logitec webcam

https://youtu.be/daS5RHVAl2U

It's a pretty good one (especially for the price), but it's a bit of a design roulette on which manufacturers are good or not."
3000,"Yeah that was pretty much it. I mean it works, if you're not an  e-thot or hardcore streamer what more do you really need. Pretty sure it can work with most cameras as long as it has the HDMI output"
3001,e-thots.  What is this world coming to?
3002,"E-thots, mostly."
3003,"Are you really surprised? The internet presents an opportunity to make what is essentially a strip club very they don't have to pay for rent or security and there is no upper limit to the number of people who can attend (neither geographic nor space), and the visitors don't need to be seen entering a strip club. Twitch decided to become that strip club"
3004,Don't even need a capture card with Sony and a few other manufacturers - I use my a6300 straight into OBS via Remote app that comes with the Sony suite.
3005,"It's a great option if you already have a halfway decent camera though, since these Chinese USB capture cards can be found for less than ten bucks and work perfectly."
3006,"Use your old phone, and one of many free pieces of software to make it a great webcam."
3007,"the issue is thickness. if you increase the sensor size your lens will also get bigger. The small sensors have the advantage that they basically focus from near to infinity. They are essentially pinhole cameras. That doesn't work with larger sensors.

Besides, with enough light you can easily drown out the noise of a small sensor. The issue is that people don't have a proper light setup. Fixing the missing light problem with better sensors/ lenses gets expensive and big real quick."
3008,"Thickness shouldn't be an issue though, since this is about external USB webcams primarily for desktops, so unless you make the thing thicker and messier than the dslr camera + capture card setups people are using instead of webcams because they can't find a decent webcam they will remain competitive."
3009,"Also cooling. Sensors generate heat and high density or larger sensors have to also dissipate the heat generated. Larger sensors mean bigger heatsinks. 

Additionally, most indoor settings are poorly lit. This means more noise from the sensor. The only way to mitigate or minimise its impact is better cooling or more light (which feeds into your comment about lighting and noise). Smaller sensors tend to be denser which increases heat output and leads to higher noise. 

Thin laptop screens are not conducive to good cameras. 

Finally, many people don't have the upload capacity to give good video. My webcam is excellent, but the picture people receive is consistently downgraded by the overzealous compression of Teams, Zoom, or slack which needs to provide 5-15 simultaneous video streams. Not only am I limited by my upload (which like most consumer internet is about 1/5th my download speed), zoom/teams/slack has to process that data and dedicate server bandwidth for my call. Everyone running crisp 1080p would eat up a ton of bandwidth without heavy compression. You can have the best webcam in the world but most meeting programs are going to compress your webcam stream to an absurd level unless you're using something dedicated for streaming where they only have to deal with your video feed."
3010,"As someone with the camera already, the capture card + cable costed me less than the cheap 50$ webcams!"
3011,"I have a [Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html) (which is around $200) and the quality is pretty good. Plus, Windows Hello is super convenient.

Also, Dell just released the [UltraSharp webcam](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-webcam/apd/319-bbhp/pc-accessories) (also at $200) which is pretty good according to reviews."
3012,"The Brio isn't any better image quality wise than the other Logitech cameras. People at the other end don't see the 4K but probably 720p or lower. There's more to image quality than resolution, past 720p its the least important problem for current webcams and the Brio shares all those same problems. 

Webcams don't lock the shutter speed to keep the image smooth they just dump that in the mix with other settings to keep the image bright and it does make the result jerky...all webcams do this not just the Brio."
3013,"The Brio is a terrible webcam. It has severe tech issues that result in nonstop problems (frame dropping, visual glitching like it was a satellite feed, outright crashing) on certain hardware.

If it works on your machine it works well but if you run into any issues, good luck getting it to work at all."
3014,Uhhh yeah never ever had any of those issues. I love mine.
3015,"IDK, I'm pretty happy with mine and would definitely recommend it.

It's also highly rated in places like Amazon and BestBuy so most people seem to have a good experience."
3016,"> A 1"" sensor with a decent readout speed and some relatively fast glass that isn't focus locked to infinity

I've had manual focus webcams and they suck. The depth of field is not wide enough to not look like poop."
3017,"Serious streamer here (full-time for years now) and I still use a C920. I recently tried out the new Elgato Facecam but it has horrible color reproduction and overdoes the smoothing so it looks like a mild snapchat filter.

I know several 'serious streamers', full-timers, who don't give a shit about a DSLR and use whatever $50-150 cam they have."
3018,I wonder what you stream with a name like that
3019,"It's a livestream of the large rooster at his farm, obviously."
3020,"> Everyone serious (like a twitch streamer) uses a DSLR camera

Which is vastly overkill for their purpose. They do it because there is nothing else appropriate for the job. It definitely gets the job done and results are good, but it shouldn't take $500+ of hardware to serve that purpose."
3021,Go pros are pretty good webcams and bridge that gap i would say
3022,"They do work in a pinch, but they get hot and FOV isn't ideal. There's a reason they're not used that often"
3023,"Never had problemos at 720p, dont live in a very hot place either though"
3024,"Most use mirrorless cameras now, but DSLRs work as well. Also most camera manufacturers support video over USB. Your PC sees the camera as a webcam."
3025,Using ILCs as a webcam over USB still isn't that great. They are all still 720p afaik.
3026,"People tend to use DSLR to refer to all ILCs.

If anything, the opposite has happened and DSLRs have pretty much caught up with mirrorless cameras for video."
3027,I understand people tend to do that but I rather use actual specific terms for hardware that is vastly different between the two. Prevents a lot of confusion especially when the names contradict the actual hardware being described.
3028,"Even if you're not serious, if your phone isn't junk, it probably will do better video quality than a webcam.  And if you have a nice phone, you can get surprisingly decent quality from it if you bother with decent lighting and all that tangential stuff."
3029,"Yes, I have used an app called droidcam to use my phone as a webcam. I used a selfie stick/phone tripod to mount it. Works pretty well!"
3030,This is the real answer... use your phone and one of those flexy little tripods and maybe a ring light
3031,No most twitch streamers just use the logitech c920...I promise you xQc does not use nor know how to use a DSLR camera set up.
3032,"Plenty of streamers do have $1,000+ video setups but it’s primarily because it’s fun to throw money at and put the specs in your profile. 99% of the time yes it’s just a tiny 200x200px window in the stream and makes absolutely no difference at all.  
  
It’s the same way many pro you tubers love making content in 1440p or even 4K because it lets them splurge and talk about their workflow and how they need amazing pc setups for their use case even though in reality 99% of people watch in 1080 or lower."
3033,"Sadly, my dslr doesn’t have hdmi pass through!!!

3034,"I'm not sure about your DSLR, but I have an old Canon T2i that can send video over USB which is what I use for my webcam. It's old and tired as far as cameras go, but it is an amazing webcam. You might be able to get it working over usb"
3035,Use Droidcam with you smartphone and save money.
3036,"I just found it really awkward to place the phone on my setup without looking up, which I won’t do!"
3037,Better to buy a small phone stand for $15 than a 1080p webcam for $40
3038,"> 1080p webcam for $40

Are they that cheap now? When I had to buy one in the early months of the pandemic, they were sold out in literally every store and the only ones who had them were scalpers selling for $80 (for 720p) and $120+ for 1080p"
3039,"Yes, demand has decreased pretty drastically and has allowed supply to catch up."
3040,Also a poor angle! I tried a flex mount but it was too flexible. I quit trying after that.
3041,"I wish there was a mount that had telescopic arm for y axis and rotate, tilt, with the base going to a plate with vesa holes so it could be screwed into your monitor's vesa holes seemlessly"
3042,Amazon had phone arms with clamps. I have it so the camera points between the two screens.

3050,"Yeah the $40 prepaid samsungs or motorolas are a godsend, the selfie camera may not be the best but if you are using a phone for webcam then the main cam on the back will do the job and have better resolution than the 20yo webcam tech on laptops."

Which is Linus' point"
3060,"Elgato just came out with a new camera. It's their first, and also the first that's actually pretty damn good! Give it a search!"
3061,"Specs look spot on. Prioritizing the right things. Nobody really needs 4k for YouTube or video conferencing, but accurate focus, color, white balance, contrast and smooth frame rate. Might have to pick this up."
3062,It's not great at all for its price. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSilVSS0k7A
3063,"Several reviews are very favorable, it is pricey, though."
3064,"I forgot the specific link but I read somewhere that the issue is that almost every webcam uses USB2 due to some weird supply chain thing and that none of the webcams have an encoder inside so they are basically sending raw video through USB2 to the PC where it is encoded into something that can be sent through the internet. And if you are sending unencoded video through USB2 you need to compress that shit so hard you are left with such a mess that there’s nothing you can do to fix things.

Why hasn’t the market evolved to fit the need? Well conveniently a massive supply chain shock and semiconductor shortage hit at the same time meaning low scale low profit webcam makers didn’t have access to the parts to make better stuff."
3065,"Next do microphones.  I have several in my collection and a bunch more at work, and the one I have from the early sixties is the one that sounds the most accurate.  Our new Shure SM7B doesn't sound nearly as good and I think cost $400, but it is super good at blocking off background noise.  That's the only thing it is good at.  I know it is famous since Michael Jackson liked it, but I think he liked it for its distortion.

Why can't we make decent microphones for a reasonable price?  Computers and amplifiers keep betting better and better, but not microphones."
3066,"Did you go from a consenser or something? I can't see how the SM7B would sound worse to you otherwise, Shure was the standard for dynamic mics back then and still kinda is. My SM58 is 10 years old but identical to one built in the 60s."
3067,"Might not have a passive power boost. Like the cloudlifter. 

Mine works wonderfully. Purchased as a last mic I'll need for gaming and doing vocal covers for funsies."
3068,"You're probably just using the wrong microphone for the job. SM7Bs sound great ( they're pretty much the standard for spoken word recording) and, if anything, cheap microphones have only gotten better since they 60s."

3070,"I think SM7bs sound great. But that depends on the usage, you probably have more technical usage that 7Bs are not built for. I'm actually using an SM57 for my voice before I had an AT 2035. Now the SM57 is permanent on the amp. But is actually doable for voice too. The thing with mics is that most it some work on EQ and leveling."
3071,"The only technology that’s really getting better is semiconductors, which explains the computers and amps. Outside of this though most things are stagnant or progress very slowly. Technology only gets better in very specific and niche ways, but not in the sense that every aspect of it improves, some things just kinda get stuck."
3072,"The front facing camera on smartphones do have a better sensor and lens than most webcams, **but that is not the whole story.**

Video and photos on a smartphone go through a ton of **real time software processing** in order to look that good. A ton of uncompressed raw data is sent directly from the camera sensor straight to the phone's SOC to be processed. I am talking about **several gigabits per second.** Way too much for USB 2 or even USB 3. USB 3.2 10Gbps might be able to handle that.

Compare this to a webcam. The sensor captures the image and then a **super cheap processor** in the webcam handles all the image processing and compression before the video feed is sent over USB2 to the PC.

In theory, you can make a webcam that basically has a smartphone SOC inside it that does all the sophisticated image processing that smartphone cameras can do. However, once you do that, the price of the webcam ballons quickly. Once a webcam costs $300+, it is tough to justify compared to something like a cheap used DSLR.

People seem to forget that USB webcams were a dying product category pre-COVID. No one gave a sh** about them for about a decade after every laptop and phone started coming with built in cameras."
3073,Why could you not offload that real time post processing to the CPU or GPU though if you give the webcam enough bandwith?
3074,"The last part is key, ""if you give the webcam enough bandwidth"".

How do you propose this? Like the above poster said, USB 3 and 3.1 are not sufficient. I'm gonna assume this is true to a degree. Then we're looking at PCIe speed now. So for a laptop, manufacturer will need to run a PCIe riser cable from the motherboard to the lid of the camera. That's not going to be cheap. For desktops, your only solution would be a thunderbolt 3 webcam which will be a hard sell because very few motherboards have thunderbolt 3 port."
3075,I am fairly sure usb 3.0 would be more than enough.

You only need look to the fact that amazing camera quality smartphones exists for $100 or less that do everything else a smartphone does, not just capture video, to see why your guess is absolute bullshit. It would barely inflate the cost at all."
3078,Last webcam I had was the Logitech 922 and it was pretty good for a 1080p cam. I bet their 4k webcam is better. Conference calls don’t need a good camera tbh. It’s more of a streamer thing to have a good cam

3081,"> I simply don't understand why this market didn't evolved that much considering the fact that streaming is extremely popular and people are very interested in good quality webcams.

Because even before covid, most people don't buy webcams so there's no demand to really improve it. 

The market for streamers and content creators are niche. Those that are looking into this are likely going to use a point and shoot camera or DSLR as webcams or purchasing higher end webcams (they do exist but at a cost). On laptops, it's the same reason. No demand to increase quality. Most business people don't even care about the quality."
3082,"I'm using a Logitech BRIO. Excellent webcam, but can be problematic for non-Windows users if the firmware is 2.x - they improved functionality for Windows users, but killed it for other operating systems where a phantom second device appears and you get mic drop outs (firmware 2.7 introduces video drop outs too). Any BRIO on 1.x firmware works perfectly, however.

Shame really, since it's such a pricey camera and such a good picture. Oh, and Logitech don't care about the non-Windows market, so they don't allow you to downgrade the firmware either."

3084,"Yes, and it made things worse. The mic generally stays up, but now you get video drop outs!

Got a bunch of BRIO's at work with various 2.x firmwares on them, but the two we have on 2.7 are pretty much useless on non-Windows machines now. For affected machines we've swapped out some 2.4 BRIO's to leave the 2.7's on Windows boxes, and are now using a third party mic with the 2.4's.

3087,"This is what I'm thinking. The video on Zoom, Teams, Webex, etc gets so compressed, it doesn't matter what you start with. I have a Logitech Brio that can do 4K video and I look like everyone else on the call."
3088,"Yea this is the answer. Diving deeper we find that it is the ISP's limiting bandwidth due to lack of competition and regulation.

I think TheVerge regularly covers this topic on their podcasts. They also mention how rural communities in Korea, Japan, and some parts of China have good broadband. In some cases their rural broadband are as fast as US Cities 5G broadband speeds.

I don't know the exact reasons why the ISPs aren't building out faster networks and lifting bandwidth restrictions, but I can probably guess that it is due to money. 

So in that way we won't be improving webcam quality. Same thing with video surveillance. Its all 1080P or 720P due to file sizes."
3089,"You are conflating the quality of the video that is captured by the camera and the quality of the compressed video that is streamed.

3090,"Ookla claims US fixed broadband averages 200/70 these days, and I just want to ask them who in the fuck they’re measuring that from. Like, only fiber really offers uploads above even 20mbps, but if fiber is so prevalent to offset cable and DSL uploads, why is download only 200…

Anyway no videoconferencing really tries using more than 2mbps. Which is more than enough for talking heads at 1080p"
3091,"Yeah that's a flat out lie I can't even get above 50 upload here and that's on a 1000 download plan

1000/50."
3092,"Nah, this ain't the answer, *at all.*

Even in high bandwidth areas people stream from noisy, small sensor shitty laptop webcams that could be from the late 90s, quality wise, with grease on the lens and bad lighting. Higher bandwidth couldn't polish those turds if it tried to.

And you don't even need that much bandwidth for streaming a quality 720p@25fps webcam anyway, it's all h264 compressed at least, it basically takes next to no bandwidth. You can easily fit that into an Mbps or two.

And if you're really starved for bandwidth, a proper high quality 640x360 capture from a quality sensor would still easily beat the shitty noisy, compressed crap most 1080p webcams churn out with its hands tied behind its back.

So no, bandwidth is no excuse for manufacturers still producing GameBoy Camera level webcams in 2021."

---

>Not really considering how big of a difference even a selfie camera is over a webcam.

You're basically backing up the point. Selfie cams are usually attached to $1000 phones with extremely powerful cpus that do lots of image processing.

Edit: ""I have a _____ brand phone and it wasn't $1000 it's got a great front facing camera"". Okay, $750 phone, $600 phone, $450 phone. The point is the same. Smh."
3101,My S10e is better than any webcam. That is not a $1000 phone.
3102,"Selfie cams are rarely attached to $1000 phones, because most people dont buy those models."
3103,The DSPs on smartphones are better. The price may be wrong but that image processing is the right answer.
3104,Because webcam users don't care and their internet is shitty anyway.
3105,"It's because people want the wrong things.

If you want a good webcam, you want good optics, and get a bigger, deeper camera. Make that, though, and you get people complaining it's too big/fat."
3106,"I completely agree and have been thinking the same recently after trying some ""high end"" webcams. They simply aren't good enough.

Consider this: The sensors in the Logitech Brio (which is approx 1/3"") and Dell Ultrasharp webcam (which is 1/2.8"") are still significantly smaller than even the most budget smartphones. (E.g. the main camera on the Samsung galaxy a52 is 1/1.7""!)

I've moved on to DSLR cameras for streaming and the quality difference is huge, but the price is too (Easily 3-6x more expensive than the ""best"" webcams!).

The problem with DSLRs isn't just the cost though. They are large and they are not suited for webcam use. They often requiring dummy batteries, hdmi connections into capture cards and then require manually switching on when you want to use it! Depending on model it might even start to overheat after a while too 

There is definitely a gap in the market for a webcam with something like a 1"" sensor!"
3107,"1/3” is bigger than a lot of smartphones. Tons of R&D goes into image processing there though, and I doubt that any of that effort gets applied to smartphones."
3108,"Isnt it because most webcams still use USB 2.0 which is limited in bandwith for like 1080p 60fps? 

It would be fine on 3.0, but that costs extra, and manufacturers don't wanna spend more than they have to.

And then, they don't exactly go for the nicest sensor possible, because that would also bring the price up.

I'm seriously thinking about picking up a dedicated ""point'n'shoot"" cam to replace mine."
3109,"I do believe that a search for “onlyfans” will get you folks who can recommend a good camera. 

They are just really into cameras."
3110,"An Elgato facecam came out recently that looks really nice. The software allows you to change exposure and other settings like a normal camera, which is great. There are a bunch of videos out there that talked about it when it released."
3111,"You tried them all? Logitech Brio HD 4K? AVerMedia Live Streamer CAM 513?

Personally I think the Elgato FaceCam looks amazing; even the heatsink for 24/7 streaming (no microphone): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7XWagX9Hg"
3112,"One reason among several: because COVID19. When you sell every single webcam in existence, at whatever price you want, and still can't cover most of the demand... why bother making them better?

Outside of this, the usual pretext is ""customers don't care about webcams"". Which is absolutely untrue, but the way they ask the question in studies/surveys is wrong and lead to this assumption."
3113,"pcs and laptops dont have good image processors, phones do have them, 3 in the sn888 and 6 in the ex 2100. Also good cameras costs much money, pc brands just cheap out or forget about them."
3114,"USB webcams don't have nearly enough bandwidth for the extensive image processing phones do, in many cases in dedicated areas of the chip.

ps: you can use your phone as webcam"
3115,"USB2 sure.

USB3.2 can handle 4k30 RAW."
3116,"Doesn't the very fact that you _can_ use a phone as a better-quality replacement for a webcam _using that very same bandwidth limited interface_ basically mean this isn't a problem?

Like a high-end webcam could just have more on-board image processing ala smartphones, use the same interface, and the result would be comparable image quality. But evidently this doesn't happen, if OP's assessment is correct."
3117,"Resolution isn't the problem.  The best camera I have is only 640x480, but it gets color, contrast, and brightness perfect so it is really nice.  It looks like a professional TV camera.  The highest resolution camera we have at work was $2k, and without really bright lights, the picture quality is just garbage."
3118,"i just wanna have a video, don't care if it is 720p or 4k."
3119,"Consumers don’t care. Nobody needs or wants webcams. Literally, other than 2020 have you ever used a webcam? No? Neither had anyone else. 

It’s not a feature anyone wanted in the past, and manufacturers are going to wait and see if it’s a one year fad or something they need to focus on in the future."
3120,"> Literally, other than 2020 have you ever used a webcam? No? Neither had anyone else. 

I have so that people could watch me masturbate over the internet."
3121,It's mad that the 2020 M1 macbook doesn't even have a freaking HD webcam
3122,"It's hard to make a good camera with multiple depths of focus and then fit it into such a small enclosure. Like physics doesn't allow it.

So what we get is about as good as it gets with current tech"
3123,"Just buy a better one. I got one from lenovo for about $38 CAD and its great. Prices became inflated and the market flooded due to covid. 

Also the reddragon one amazon is decent too (but lenovo is better for the price)"
3124,"Mostly because there's no demand for them. Consumers seem to be happy with what they're getting (shafted with), so there's no need for manufacturers to spend more in that area."
3125,"Yeah, I'd definitely use my phone if I wanted to video chat. But I rarely want to video chat, because I'm not a black woman on a crowded bus, and I own headphones."
3126,"Many reasons, bandwith to the computer via these external ports and streaming data  over the internet needs to be on UDP and compress and omit a lot of pixels to be workable. 

Things you don't have an issue with in a phone who's databus is on board and local storage stream is faster."
3127,"They are terrible because people are unwilling to pay $200+ for a camera for video calls.

Elgato recently released one thats not actually terrible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MNjNw_OxEE

If you really care get a proper camera and use HDMI capture. Unfortunately my work laptop is too locked down to allow use of a HDMI capture dongle or my Canon cameras webcam drivers so it's a shitty C270 for me. With the Elgato I can use my own PC to get the settings right and then plug it into my work PC."
3128,"Because phone makers one of the main concern is camera. So they spend too much r&d to camera. But computer company’s main concern is price or performance. Phones sell much more with “the best camera in the world” like advertising but computers do not. 

And there is image sensor processor and ai that runs behind a phone camera. But that is either too expensive for computers or they have to ıse an arm processor rather than x86. 

And there is thickness problem, the phone is thin but laptop screen is thinner so they can squeeze only so much lens that it will suck for an eternity. There will be no webcam that matches a good phone camera or dslr ever (except that using a dslr for webcam). 

So if you want good quality for webcam just buy a camera that supports external display and use a capture card and obs virtual cam.

External webcam market is a small market because most people just use their laptop webcams or their phone as webcam and streamers use a dslr cam for webcam. So they do not sell. So they do not spend as much r&d as other camera markets. So they suck and they will continue to suck."
3129,"Pre covid no one cared. Webcams were used mostly by non profesionals who didn't really know what they were doing. Any proffesional or wannabe steamer/whatever ended up buying a much more expensive solution (DSLR and caputure cards).  


Once Covid hit all of the 'best' options went out of stock and largely still aren't in stock, while people are upsold on 'real cameras'.  
A rubbish web cam is all thats needed for a tiny screen in Zoom or whatever anyway so why would the companies make a better product if the bad one sells out.  


Business in 2021 isn't about making a good product that works and your customer is happy with its about making as much money as possible. Those things are mutually exclusive now it seems."
3130,"Logitech C920/922 is really neat with the Logitech Capture software tbh, goes for sub €100."
3131,"Last year I started working from home like many of us and had the same dilemma, my laptop webcam really sucked (it was ok here and there but not for daily use) so I made my research and same like you I wasn't into spending lot's on a new webcam, saw way too many recommendation for the logitech one and thought that under $80 can't really go wrong with that and I am very glad with this buy, the video quality is so much better than my laptop it's not even funny, I hope laptop manufacturer will step up there webcam game soon

Edit: not sure I am allowed to post amazon links in here, the exact model webcam is the number 3 on this list: https://www.moneycaptain.com/best-webcam/"
3132,"Logitech c920. Its worth the investment from the beginning as a great budget cam and a cam that many streamers still use later into their stream careers. 

There are filters and luts you can download to make your setup more aesthetically pleasing. The real secret is you should focus on lighting for your stream."
3133,"Your mobile phone! I use my old iphone 7 as a webcam. Better than a Logitech c920 ! Use the app ""iVCam"" to use your mobile as webcam.The license costs 10$ . Happy streaming 👍"
3134,"even better, you don’t need to spend money. 

add the source into OBS, right click, there should be an option called crop/filters, click that, click ‘+’, and then you can crop the watermark off of the picture! it’s what i do and even after the free trial ends i enjoy the camera. easy to set up."
3135,"Microsoft's Lifecams are a decent budget option, but the detail to look for is the webcam's resolution."
3136,I started streaming in 2013 on a PS2 Eye Toy and used it as my mic too LOL... eventually moved up to a logitech c270 for a year or so then switch to the c920 for the rest of my streaming career
3137,"Save up for a C920, then you won’t have to get a new webcam for a long time. Also, invest in a cheap ring light. Lighting is often just as important as the camera itself, even a 1080p camera looks pixelated in poor lighting."
3138,"I actually like my Razer Kiyo a lot, more than the much lauded c920 from Logitech I had given to my partner since she needed one for WFH. It also saves you needing a ring light!"

3144,"I'm not saying its crap, never had the chance to use any of them yet. $100 more than the streamcam. Its just ive read a few posts that the encoding itself is pretty dodgy. Even though its meant to do 4k the way its powered and encodes the footage it becomes pretty dodgy."
3145,"well, can be used in 1440p, very nice picture quality, but for 4k you need a top pc. I used in 1440p long time, working great"
3146,Idl whose trashing the brio. The brio is really good.
3147,Do you have it? If so does the quality come true and crisp? I've seen comparisons and they are very similar to the C922 etc
3148,It's about the best thing out as far as web cams go. Unless you wanna go camlink.
3149,"The brio is the best webcam you can buy right now but it's not cheap and you need good lighting. The webcam on its own looks ""terrible"" but stick two elgato light and your getting fantastic video quality better than 90% of streamers on twitch. But 2 lights are £240 and the webcam is basically £200. If I was short I cash 100% would be buying good lighting not cheap Amazon crap first. With good lighting you can even make a c920 look very good"
3150,"I've just purchased the Razer Kiyo Pro, and holy damn, i cannot stress enough how this webcam blows everything out of the water, like literately."
3151,"it doesn't, it's shit."
3152,"Look at all of Logitechs offerings. If you really want to get the most out of it, you will have to learn about lighting and composition. There are lots of YT videos about it, but they all share the same thought: any camera will suck out of the box... proper (not necessarily expensive) lighting is what will make any shot look amazing. If you have an RTX card, you can have the ability to blur out the background."
3153,do you know much about  Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcams? I was looking at getting one
3154,"IMO my top ticks are the StreamCam first, C922 second, and C920 third. All great cameras. The C920 is the gold standard for webcams. The other 2 have updated performance and features that may or may not fit what you're looking for. Again, I cannot stress how important lighting is. Thats what frustrates me about some of the reviews out there is that they only look at basic out-of-the-box performance and don't try to squeeze the best look out of it."

I figured for $15, it was worth a buy. And if there was something wrong with the cam, then I'd just dispute it on Amazon.

I don't know much about the webcam market, but I did a little shopping around and it seems like the Microsoft LifeCam Studio and the Logitech HD Pro C920 are the two flagships. There aren't that many other companies that seem to come close, as all the other webcams I've seen have well under 100 reviews on Amazon."

It's very noticeable. Though for $15, it's an incredibly great value. I wish they could offer better image quality under low light conditions, but pretty much all webcams are like that.

And I've also heard good things about the Logitech camera. I haven't actually owned one myself, but many reviews say its one of the best."
3182,"Does the Studio have the same autofocus issue? If the issue really is as prominent as you say, I'd like to return/resell the Cinema and buy a Studio instead."
3183,"The Studio does not have the autofocus issue. But there may have been a firmware update that fixed the problem with the Cinema. Also, the autofocus issue only lasts about a second, so after that time, it's back to normal.

After a quick google, it looks like the autofocus can be disabled. If I were you, I would just try it out yourself before returning it. It's not going to affect your video calls too much, but for $15, I'd say it's worth it."
3184,"I have the Cinema and Studio both as well; ended up disabling autofocus on the Cinema and adjusting it manually. Since getting the studio, I haven't noticed it doing the same thing, but I also haven't used it nearly as much. If you can get a good deal, go for the Studio"
3185,"I have the Cinema HD as well with an autofocus issue. I'm hoping there's a fix. I've had it for a while now and when I'm in skype, I'll move a bit after a while and it seems to focus all the way out and right back in to a clear image."
3186,I just use the xbox 360 webcam that they used to sell. It actually had a great resolution and it was plug'n'play.
3187,"i have a c520, cheap and does the job, whatev lol"
3188,Don't get a brilliant quality webcam if you internet is shit.
3189,Logitech HD Pro C920.
70151,Amen.
3191,I personally use the Logitech c920 webcam.  Based on personal taste. Others may feel other cameras are better but for me I've had zero problems while using it for over a year and a half so far. Plug and play and quick to setup.  Chroma key is a breeze via obs using the c920 as well.
3192,"New streamer here. I use the Logitech C922. It's $99, and honestly worth every penny in my personal opinion. I even tried it with a green screen and a chroma filter and the image quality is crispy and very high quality. Great starter camera."
3193,I’d save a few bucks and get the 920. It’s the same camera but without their crappy personify chroma cam thing that doesn’t work. Better off doing a chroma key in obs
3194,"There are small differences, like 922 is slightly better for low lighting areas. In my personal case this was relevant, but to be fair personify is actually the worst software and I tend to never use it"
3195,"the 'low light setting"" on the c922 makes it look much better then the c920 for people that dont use professional lighting setups. Also its usually on sale for 50(black friday)-75 dollars. I upgraded from the c920 to the c922 and never looked back. The Personify Chroma cam thing is garbage though and wont use it."
3196,"If your content is 60fps, and you want your camera to be also, my Brio is immaculate."
3198,See flair
3199,I use c922. USB webcams aren't as great as DSLRs but getting proper lights and learning how to set up your webcam (turn off auto settings) will improve quality. This is from my experience.
3200,C920 will forever reset to auto.  Not sure if c922 is the same but if not that would be a selling point for me if I didn’t have one already
3201,"It doesn't reset while I'm live at all. It will the next day or if I close OBS and don't start it up for a while. But once I set it up the way I want it, it stays that way until I'm done :)

Funny enough. If I stream through OBS Studio, it resets to auto on its own while I'm live. So I switched back to SLOBS and I haven't had that problem since."
3202,It stays the way until you're done... or it resets to auto on its own while you're live?
3203,You have to install the Logitech software in order to solve this problem.
3204,It did it with the software for me.  Software is only thing you can use to edit the cams settings.
3205,"The webcams you listed are both USB webcams, which are not as good as DSLR cameras but more than good enough for streaming. There is no need to invest in the most expensive equipment.  


Out of the c920 and the c922, the latter is the better model. The c920 can record 30 FPS at 1080p/720p, while the c922 can record 30 FPS at 1080p or 60 FPS at 720p. The c922 can also do some cool background removal effects, similar to what you can get through Nvidia Broadcast's digital green screen."
3206,"You are right, but so many ppl are reviewing 922hd as worst in the quality compare to 920 HD... Its weird in 2021 not able to find quality wrb cam review, YouTube and so many blogs where reviews are done with apparently dumb reviewers... All waste of time... To go thru.


Well I was assuming that in 2021 where ppl have 1gib internet connections it should be good to see relatives on Skype etc in the best quality as possible... We are not living in caves anymore..."
3207,"When I bought a webcam, I was initially going to go with the c922, but after watching reviews ended up buying the Razer Kiyo which sits in the same price bracket. That one might be worth looking into! :)  


I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality. It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face."
3208,"see this is the thing, i saw a youtube video razer kiyo vs c922hd pro ... basically 0 difference, c922hd pro quality etc was better... so just confusing ...

&#x200B;

what reviews? based on what parameter they claimed kiyo is better... i assume 0 facts, just someone said something. Yes it has a lightning but during the day its not needed that much and during the evening it wont help that much."
3209,"I don't remember the exact reviews, but I looked up ones that just gave the two cameras side by side at varying levels of ambient light and made my decision from there."
3210,"so u can see how much bias is there ...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckJU8SXYOeQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckJU8SXYOeQ) 

no difference or 922 hd looks better to me ..."
3211,"thanks

&#x200B;

well maybe its worth to use DSLR or GoPro ... I have sony rx100 ii; it comes with hdmi port... so maybe using [https://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Camcorder-Streaming-Conference-Broadcasting/dp/B08QNCWHHS/ref=psdc\_6795230011\_t2\_B08CH9FC22](https://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Camcorder-Streaming-Conference-Broadcasting/dp/B08QNCWHHS/ref=psdc_6795230011_t2_B08CH9FC22) and some tooling it might work? 

&#x200B;

Or to buy go pro ... which is better then stick 80 pounds to camera that has no other way to utilize..."
3212,"The C920 is an amazing webcam so I’d be picking that up over the c922 never had any issues with it and it looks great, if the picture looks bad then you probably got poor lighting. Many others share the same opinion that the c920 is better then the 22"
3213,"^ + 1, and it often goes on sale on Amazon"
3214,Sony a6xxx series and a elgato cam Link.
3215,"Thanks for the answer man! I’ve got a Nikon D810, could I connect it to the cam link and stream for 3 hours? Thanks"
3217,"I know that a pretty huge amount of german streamers use this. I don't exactly know which revision or version they are using. I never heard about that problem, maybe you investigate this before buying anything."
3218,"There is literally no reason to any other camera than the C920. The 922 is a pile of hot garbage. But if youre only streaming at 720p, the C920 has the capability of giving you the very best picture a 720p output can display. If you are having issues, I 100% promise you it is a lighting/settings issue."
3219,"Im thinking of buying a webcam. Is these issues common for this webcam, would the c920 be better?"
3220,"I literally just got off tech support with Logitech about their garbage drivers that don’t save cam settings. I have a 20 and a 22. I definitely agree that the 22 has grainy video even with proper lighting. I’m currently experimenting with their other drivers, they recommended a separate one for each of my cams, instead of just using an aggregate driver.  I’ll let you know if it works, the not saving settings thing has been an absolute pain, but from what I can tell is not OBS’s fault, and rather is Logitech driver issues."
3221,"If the budget isn’t an issue, I really like the c920 because it has a sort of paleness to it that I like, but the c930e is a noticeable difference when upgrading and it has a nice clear picture and is smooth"
3222,"Thanks a lot man, will check it out. Anything about the BRIO webcam?"
3223,"I’m not familiar with that, I’ve only had the c920 and c930e"
3224,"I invested a 100e into a game capture card and connected my DSLR into it. So if you have a Camera with a HDMI output you can do the same and the quality will be a lot better than what most webcams can achieve :) I made a video on that matter: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yhMBbH3kk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yhMBbH3kk)

Hope this helped :)"
3225,I paid €60 for this in February and just looked up the exact same link I bought from and it’s €100. Crazy. I’m very happy with mine and would definitely buy it again for €100 if that was my budget. It doesn’t do great with natural sunlight ( not sure if others do ) so I stay in a darkish corner while using it ( streaming or recording ) and have other lights to shine on my face like desk lights and its great!
3226,Same issue with natural sunlight.  I find myself having to reset it a lot as the lighting changes in my streaming space (my bedroom which has 5 windows)
3227,I have that same cam. I love it. It’s my face cam and has done well for me. If you do get it there are a few tips I can share with you for balancing the washout that can happen with lighting. It’s a solid cam though
3228,"I would love to hear your tips, I use this same camera."
3229,When I get home I’ll put together some specific things I changed. Will be easier while looking at the “configure video” screen
3230,"Thank you, I really appreciate it. It’s kinda fun tweaking settings to get your stream setup all perfectly."
3231,"I just bought one, would love some tips"
3232,I just got home. Been doing hurricane prep. Give me some time. I’m gonna write something up for y’all. Remember it will just be a baseline of what to look at when you want to fix some of the color issues
3233,Ok. For this cam the setting that helped me the most was gain. It seems to be very light sensitive. Washout happens with most of my desk lighting. Works like a charm for green screen for the same reason it washes me out. I have some led desk lamps. They have a built in filter but I made a diffuser for them anyway to break up the light some. Gain and Saturation. Less adjustment than you think for a big difference. Each situation will be different. I tested what I was going to say with different styles of lighting. All needed different adjustments. I wanted to give you guys some numbers or settings but I can’t do that without being you in front of it. It’s a great cam and has done well for me. No complaints. Everything needs tweaking. Nothing is perfect right out of the box.
3234,"I went for a Razer Kiyo because anything worth it's salt from Logitech was sold out or +$50 compared to the Kiyo. I will say the Kiyo goes in and out of stock on the manufacturer's website often, but I have had no complaints. From what I read, it compares well to Logitech models and comes with a built-in ring light, which is a nice bonus. Just offering an alternative!"
3235,"Another big up for the kiyo. I have a larger ring light that I use now instead of the built in one, but the camera itself is great quality. I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I gave it a shot. (Plus, yeah the logi was out of stock when I first started steaming). Also, if you're into aesthetics, I personally thing it looks pretty rad."
3236,"I've been using an app called ivCam. It basically turns you cell phone into a Webcam and it's been great. If your cell has a good camera, I highly recommend it."
3237,"That webcam is incredible, I'd highly recommend it for that price. It also does the rendering through the hardware of the camera so it's not intensive on your setup."
3238,"There’s an app that can turn your phone into a webcam specifically for OBS in the App Store and the one time purchase to unlock everything is $16.99 so much cheaper than a webcam :) I’ve tested it and it works great! Been using my iPhone 8 with it. It gives you different quality settings too, like medium, HD, 4K. Just make sure to mute the mic within the app so you’re not double layering your mic audio"
3239,C922 is good
3240,I saw this video and decided to go for more generic one. I got my for 28 EUR and it seems decent. It's gonna be delivered tomorrow to me and I hope it will look at least somewhat what people wrote about it and posted videos for. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIhMt2wuNPY&t=226s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIhMt2wuNPY&t=226s)
3241,"The price of all web cams right now are inflated because so many people are using video conferencing due to COVID-19.  Many stores are out of stock, and amazon/online sellers are raising their prices.  It's a good question whether the C920 is still worth it, but keep in mind that any other suggestions will also be at inflated prices."
3242,Refurbished cannons are decent if you want to get into filming and pictures. Cannon often has sells and you can get a m50 for only 350$Which usually that stuff runs to about 600 :)
3243,"I have this cam too. It's great. But yes, prices are through the roof right now I guess because of inventory. Same thing goes for microphones it seems."
3244,"When looking for a mini tripod, what do I need it to have so it will work with my Logitech Streamcam? The camera from logitech DID NOT include a tripod with it. I was looking at one of the Joby ones. Thanks"
3245,Look for a Logitech C615 it's the same thing just not 60fps
3246,Check out alpha gaming video on the webcams. He compares a couple cheap ones with the BRIO and c920. I went with the Chinese $40 webcam that looks just as good as the c920
3247,"I feel really strongly about this. Not webcams specifically, but when people post things like ""Just starting out/thinking about streaming, what do I need?"" and people push them toward top end pcs and hundreds of dollars of tech like that's the minimum setup you need to stream. I don't know if people genuinely think someone just starting out needs a professional quality setup (obviously false,) or if they just enjoy pushing people to invest all their cash in a hobby they don't even know if they'll pursue longterm yet. But as a small streamer myself, it's not really my place to openly disagree when I see those posts."
3248,I pushed back streaming for over a year just because I thought I didn't have good enough equipment. What a waste. Keep it simple!
3249,"Exactly man, like, I have a Ryzen 3600 with 16gb of ram and I can stream any games nearly perfect. And some people WILL TELL YOU you need at least a Ryzen 7 3700x + 32gb of ram, or a RTX Video card, to use as a stream encoder."
