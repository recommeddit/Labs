7450,"There’s like 3 different variations of the Acer swift x, which would you recommend for me?"
7451,The link and specs are on the list.
7452,"hey just came across your series. Super helpful. I recently took a travel job and want to buy a laptop so I have something to do in the hotel rooms when i’m done work. Weight and battery life don’t matter for me at all. The longest flight i would need to go on would be ~6 hours so i would need about 6-8 hours of battery life which i assume is pretty standard. I play mostly single player rpg games. Only shooter online game i play is destiny 2. 

Any suggestions? I’d like to keep it around 2k maybe 2500 max if it’s a big difference. Graphics and screen size are probably the most important to me as i’m used to gaming on an 85” 4k oled tv. 

Thank you in advance if your respond!"
7453,"Hi, I'd say that you might as well with a gaming laptop. I'd recommend looking at my [gaming laptop recommendation list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/). I'd go with the Eluktronics Mech-15 G3 on that list. Ryzen 9 5900HX, RTX 3070 max 140W, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1440p 15.6"" 165Hz IPS display."
7454,"Thanks! I actually noticed you had a gaming list right after I posted this & that’s the laptop that caught my eye! I was thinking about getting the 17” version with 1gb sad and 32 go of ram. Is that a good one to look for or is there better options at that price point? Also, is there a big difference between the 3060 and the 3070 to justify the price jump?"
7455,"If you're referring to the Eluktronics MAX-17, that's a great choice too. The RTX 3070 is worth spending more for if possible."
7456,I am! Thanks for the quick responses.
7458,"Hello I'm looking for a laptop that can support productivity tasks and can run a virtual desktop for work (citrix workspace). Considering the M1 macbook air (16GB ram, considering 512GB storage) but compatibility to the virtual desktop is my main gripe esp for excel. What would you suggest? Something similar to the MBA price is okay"
7459,"Hi, the Acer Swift X on my list is a very cost effective option. Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3050 Ti graphics, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display for $1,099. It should be viable for your uses."
7460,"thanks so much! Why is the Acer Aspire 5 and the HP Envy several hundred dollars more than the gateway notebook?

From the stats displayed on the list, they seem to have the same cpu/gpu/storage 

I guess I’m just wondering what does the extra money get you? What other stats should I be considering?

Thanks so much for making this, makes my laptop search so much easier!"
7461,"The Aspire 5 and HP Envy are both more well known devices from well known companies. Gateway is virtually unknown these days. So, you get better reliability and support if you pay more."
7462,"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-7i-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-slate-grey/6426705.p?skuId=6426705&ref=212&loc=1&ref=212&loc=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD-ORIjF66Z-bvYoKDn4EFu8TKXEE&gbraid=0AAAAAD-ORIjF66Z-bvYoKDn4EFu8TKXEE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_ZKN18SF9AIV2mpvBB0Cdw5hEAQYAiABEgJWEPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Does this seem like good value? I’d be using it primarily for running an app or two and multiple chrome tabs, streaming, etc. 

If this seems good, would you recommend an extra 8gb RAM? I’ve heard 16g is becoming the new standard for Windows 10. If so, what would an additional 8g stick typically cost, and how easy is install?

Thanks so much for making this!"
7463,"The RAM is not upgradable on that laptop, so you would need to find a 16 GB configuration if you want 16 GB RAM. I've seen the 12 GB RAM + 512 GB SSD version for a bit over $700 before, so that deal is mediocre."
7464,"hello! was hoping to find some help here - am looking for a durable laptop (to last 3 - 4 years) which has good battery life and speakers, and preferably is also able to handle a large number of tabs open (20 - 30). would also really appreciate a keyboard that is easy to type on and doesn't jam (like the mac butterfly keys for example). would you have any recommendations? no real budget constraints at the moment though of course tending to the affordable side would always be better. thanks so much!"
7465,"Hi, are you fine with a MacOS device? Do you have a max budget in mind?"
7466,"hi, thanks for the quick response - would prefer windows if possible, and max budget would be around \~1.5k but i can go up where necessary."
7467,"Thank you. If you're looking for durability, I would recommend the [**Lenovo ThinkPad T15 Gen 2 15""**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/YgbBjm), the $1,374.45, although it isn't on my list. You get a 4-core i5-1135G7 processor, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS 300 nit display. It should be solid for general use programs."
7468,"Thanks a lot! Just to keep the options open, would there be any laptops that you'd recommend in the slightly lower price range?"
7469,"The [**Lenovo ThinkBook 15 Gen 3**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/NKR2kv) is another option. It isn't as durable or reliable, but still a decent option."
7470,"Hi, I'm looking for a new laptop. I have a Dell Inspirion 13 3960 = got it about 5 years ago as a gift, but currently, I'm having major issues with it: fan was working overtime (fixed with an application), however now it says I have no AC adapter, and will no longer charge. I'm typing on my laptop currently with a 0% charge.

I'm in college for Informatics (like IT easiest way to explain) and we use VM sometimes. What would be the best laptop in theory for me? I want a decent processor to run the VM terminal assignments - though I want battery life to be my focus, most important I just don't want it to be heavy. Also, definitely not in the 1,000 price range! I hope I'm not asking for too much lol

\*\*\*Edit actually I do have some saved scholarship money - so if it's a more expensive one, but will help me even after I finish these last two years, I'll take it!"
7472,"Ah sorry for the delay! My laptop have no fully died. We're gonna try replacing the battery and the charger. So, instead of a laptop, I'm thinking of a gaming PC instead. Do you have a list for that?"
7473,"Unfortunately, no. If you're interested in building a PC, I'd recommend looking at /r/buildapc."
7474,All good! Thank you though! :)
7475,Hi im looking for a laptop that is light and has good battery life that can do photo editing plus some gaming cs go for example.
7477,Probably around 1k
7478,"Thank you. I would go with the Acer Swift X on my list. It has a dedicated graphics card, unlike most other options on my list. It would be an excellent choice for games like CS:GO and photo editing."
7479,"Is this model spec you referring to

7484,okay thank you
7485,Hello!  Why is the Lenovo Thinkpad in 14” more expensive than the 15” ? Thank you so much for this list!
7486,"Hey there, I havent shopped for a laptop since 2012, so I am long removed from the game. I had a dell, and bought a chromebook a couple of years ago and hate it. 

Do you have a good summary of each brand? Acer vs Asus vs Dell vs Lenovo etc?"
7487,"Hey! I've been searching for hours. I'm looking for a budget laptop that's also snappy. Not going to do any gaming on it. 

Looking for something:

* Under $400 (Ideally the cheaper the better)

* Will mostly be using Audacity for simple instrument recording, nothing too demanding. Maybe some web browsing and video streaming.

* At least 2 usb ports

* Battery isn't important as it will stay in one spot mostly connected to a charger. 

* SSD would be preferred. 

* I'm sure I'm probably only going to find 4GB of RAM within my price range and specifications, but if a dual 8gb (2x4gb) exists in that range that would be nice. 

Hopefully something exists at that price."

7490,"Thank you! That is a lot of good components for the price. I'm a little weary after reading the reviews on it, but I guess I won't know til' it gets here."
7491,"If things don't go well, you can always return it and try another device."
7492,"Dear legos45,

How would you rate AORUS 15P YD-73US244SH? I went to a laptop store and this was the best performance overprice they have there. I am switching from Mac to PC. I want a gaming laptop that can run any game very well even at ultra settings and will last for at least 5 years (aka able to play any new game that comes out the next 5 years). My max budget, for now, would be 2400 USD. I am still hesitant with AORUS 15P YD-73US244SH because it is 3080 8gb instead of 3080 16gb. Your guidance is very much appreciated! Thank you!

Edit: I am also hesitant with GS7611257 (since similar price). It has Core i9-11900H and 3070 8gb 95W max (a better CPU with lower GPU). For Aorus, it has i7-11800H but 3080 8gb at 130W max (a lower CPU with a better GPU).

Going for these as these are currently available when compared to others which requires like 2+ months"
7493,"Hi, I'd say that it is generally a good device, but it depends on how much you're paying for it."
7494,"2099 usd for Aorus and 2199 usd for MSI. Which one would you recommend me and why? Sorry if I sound a bit rude. 😅😅

Edit: I went to the store again. They gave me the final price with tax (186 USD) and protection stuff (includes malware installation and hardware fixes as well as extended return period to 60 days but the price is 199USD) and it bumped up to 2500… for aorus… my goodness. Do you think it’s worth to get the protection if I am leaving the US in like 1 month and a few days? Do you know how much it might cost to get malware as well as installing windows 10? Please guide me! Thank you for your patience dear legos45 🙏 I am a total newb with PC stuff as I have been using mac forever since the beginning.

Edit: sorry I just realized this is a general computer thread not the gaming laptop thread"
7495,I want to buy a lightweight laptop and my choices are razer blade 14 or zephyrus g15 or zephyrus g14. Im actually thinking of buying razer blade 14. Is it a good choice over g15 or g14?

Looks like it might be a decent deal. I ordered one to see how it performs. I'm thinking it might have the similar heat issues as the other ones, so any advice on how to set it up?  


The display looks nicer (more expensive too though), so I'm hoping the color is better than the 3060 GE76 from Costco."

Would you take a quick look at this? Ryzen 7 5700U with 16gb RAM. Assuming I can get this for $550...From what I've seen, it seems like it'd be hard to beat.

Would like for it to be able to stream movies and videos well but priority is ability to have multiple tabs open, run excel, and PowerPoint at the same time. Also have Bluetooth capabilities. Price range is <4000$ but priority is good deal for the price and able to do the above without overheating or needing a reset. I’m fine with waiting longer for better if something is just around the corner but if not I’ll pull the trigger now. Not necessary but nice: Possibly able to plug in and share screen with hdmi, able to plug in headphones, a mouse, a second screen if I had one. External audio input and output would be nice as well although yet again not necessary. Any recommendations?"
7516,"less than $4k??? US? lol.  seriously, for what you want to do, get a macbook  pro 16. Or wait for the M2 next year.

Otherwise, If I had a choice, of any machine, I would get this:

https://us.msi.com/Content-Creation/Creator-Z16-A11UX"
7517,Still a fan of that machine?
7518,"yes, but for your situation, I think ram is more important.  You aren't gaming, or doing anything that would necessitate a high powered graphics card. While I believe a macbook pro, would suit your needs, I actually own a laptop which would be suited for school. a thinkpad nano, with the i7, 16 gb of ram. weighs less than 2 lbs, and is very easy to carry, long battery life, and with a 65 watt GaN charger, you can take it anywhere."
7519,"For me? Lol i need a laptop to run After Effects and Cinema 4d smoothly.

So Ill be heavy dependent on RAM and Graphic Cards. Will need a big laptop too so 17"" at least with a good colour display (as I make color grading too).

Still trying to figure out the processor that I need but the listing you made is actually very impressive. 

Im investing a lot into this, at least for my position, so I will try to make the best buy out of the money. 

Id go with M1 but im not a fan of apple products, havent used iphone in 10 years and as much as I read, it still lacks in performance compared to windows laptops while using gpu dependant softwares


So if you have any suggestion, id be very thankful. Not much of a pc geek"
7520,"for what you are describing. maybe an Asus Pro-Art studio book.  It sounds like this is your actual profession, so I would avoid gaming laptops.  Gaming laptops are more a ""can do that kind of stuff on a budget"", vs dedicated machines.  You can spec those out with quaddro graphics cards, but that gets pricey. or you can get them with RTX cards for cheaper.  Still, the macbook pro with M1 is no slouch. You would be doing yourself a disservice by not even looking at it (No, I don't own an iphone either) but I think it's worth looking into."
7521,"As far as ive read online, M1 is pretty good but everyone in the same professions advices to get into those rtx graphic cards.

Thanks for the input on gaming laptops, it is helpful info, i also will use it in the future for multiple video outputs and it looks like gaming laptops do a good job on it, however I will take your advice. Will need a good tool to work and not slack off"

7547,"What's the best options under 1500$, mainly for working\minimal gaming (such as league, which doesnt require a lot). Would pref 15inch, i guess i could do 14 as well. Could be 2in1, since i do some graphic work"

Here's a link to the 256 GB SSD version, which is within budget. Great battery life, low weight, and can handle lighter games."
7551,"Is LG any good right now? I've had very bad experience with their phones, so kinda hard to commit buying one of their laptops"
7552,I'd say that their Gram lineup of laptops have a pretty good reputation.

I was looking for a general utility laptop. I want to be able to be creative and edit simple videos and upload videos for vlogging. I also like to be creative. somewhere around the 500$ I can shell out if the price is right."
7555,"Hi, working with the budget, I'd go for the Gateway 14.1"" on my list. i5-1135G7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14.1"" display. It should be fine for general use and light video editing."

7559,Decent (8-9 hour) battery life should be good. Weight isn't too important and my budget is $1000.

7562,"Hi, what do you plan on doing on your laptop?"
7563,"General school work, the occasional watching videos, movies, that sort of stuff, as well as if possible editing videos."
7564,"I see. I'd say that a great choice is the Acer Swift X on my list. Strong specs (suitable for general use and video editing), good battery life, and a low weight."
7565,"Checked it out and it's great, is there something lower priced that resemble it? Appreciate your help by the way."
7566,"Unfortunately, no, the Swift X is one of a kind around its price point."

7615,How did you find out so fast? Did you set an alert of some kind or just checked randomly?
7616,"I just kept checking randomly tbh. I would check on average 4 times a day. 

This morning, I woke up around 7:30am and first thing I did was check and it was being sold by Amazon for $599 and it said there was like 10 left. I made the order and came back and commented on your comment right after since I knew you were also interested. By the time I drove to school, i noticed it was out of stock already."
7617,Dang. I've honestly been checking like every 2 hours every day for the week. This morning I woke up at my usual 7 AM but I didn't check right when I woke up for some reason and waited till like 8 AM (and also I read your message at like 8:30 this morning but it was not there sadly). It must have sold out in like 30 minutes. Thanks for letting me know though. I appreciate you messaging me anyway. Also congrats on buying it and I wish you the best with it. Now hopefully I can grab one with some luck.
7618,Yeah mate. I’m sorry. I’m sure you’ll come across one soon. Don’t go crazy over it. Best of luck and let me know when you get your hands on one.
7619,I just got it right now! It's in stock again! YES. Had to use my 6 month free prime student trial but I got it. Came out to $640 though since of tax.
7620,"I just got mine in the mail today. I have yet to power it on and set it up. 

But let me tell you this, the build quality feels fucking fantastic. People complaining about this computer having low build quality are nothing but snobs. If it isn’t built by titanium, the haters don’t like it. The computer feels very good."
7621,"Hey I got mine on Thursday and started using it on Friday too! The build quality seems solid to me also. I know it's not all-metal but it seems really sturdy and I have an old plastic ASUS laptop that is much more flimsy and all-plastic and it has lasted like 8 years so I don't expect to have much issues with the laptop when it comes to durability. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to take notes on it since this is my first time taking digital notes, but so far the computer has been pretty good, and of course especially for the price."

I'm looking for a sweet spot that is 8 GB RAM (preferrably upgradeable to 16 GB) with a minimum 512 GB SSD and NOT an i7/Ryzen 7 processor. I've done a bunch of research and found that for the most part, i7/Ryzen 7 processors are a bad idea in a small laptop because they are constantly overheating and are throttled down to the speed of an i5/Ryzen 5 anyway - so why spend more for those? 

This ASUS looks like a good option for about the right price."

I'm a finance major so I won't be doing any gaming or anything I really only need it for Microsoft office like word and excel and streaming on Netflix and stuff. They're both around the same weight and storage also isn't too much of a concern for me because I probably won't need much. I'm not too knowledgeable on computers and just wanted some advice and opinions. :)))
7632,"Hi there! This post is incredibly timely, as I am in the market for a new laptop.

I have not owned a personal computer in about five years, as I have relied on my company laptop for everything. I will no longer have this computer in the near future as I am leaving the company, so I will need a new computer soon.

My current computer is some sort of Dell Latitude. 

As you mentioned in your post, this computer is for general use for streaming videos, browsing, and lots of Excel. I don’t anticipate much gaming as I’m more of a console player, and I don’t work in any sort of graphic design or music-production related field. 

As for budget, I don’t really know what to expect. I’m certainly not looking for the lowest price range, but equally I’m not sure I can justify $1,300+ for a computer. I received the $600 stimulus check this morning, so let’s say that I’m willing to spend a little more for higher quality. 

I’ve browsed the table on your site which is very nicely laid out, but I’m kinda lost on what I should be looking for. 

Wondering if you’d be able to help me out."
7633,"Hi, does battery life or weight matter to you? How much do you prioritize build quality?"
7634,"I don’t want a heavy laptop, and a decent battery life would be nice. Not sure what you mean by build quality though."
7635,"I see. Never in the past would I normally recommend the MacBook Air or Pro because they didn't provide much value in the past, but since they feature the new Apple M1 chip, they are definitely too good to ignore. Their build quality is solid, and what is especially nice about the MacBook Air is that it lacks a fan, so fan noise is not an issue. Also, their battery lives are incredible because of the Apple M1 chip (15 hours on the Air, 20 hours on the Pro).

If you want a Windows device, the ASUS Zenbook 13 with the i7-1165G7 is a great choice. The performance isn't anything crazy, but it has solid build quality and good battery life."
7636,"Thank you for these recommendations. I just read a CNET article about the Asus and it says that there is no 3.5mm audio jack, which is a bit annoying since I like to use bookshelf speakers on my desk.

The reviews online for this laptop are not stellar, which is surprising for a $1,000 laptop"
7637,"ASUS typically includes a dongle for 3.5mm audio, but it seems like they don't with that particular configuration.

What issues in particular? My experience with Zenbooks in the past has been relatively positive. 

You could also try finding the newer Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen Intel on sale. At the normal pricing, it isn't typically a great value but sometimes Dell has promotions."
7638,"Hey there, me again. I am going to be needing a new laptop more urgently than expected as I was laid off this morning and will need a new computer for job hunting.

Doesn’t seem like waiting for the Asus Zenbook 13 with i7 and 1TB SSD is a wise move, unless it comes back in stock shortly. Do you have any similar recommendations that may be more widely available? Any that I can by in-store this week would be ideal.

Do you think that perhaps I should look for a less expensive model?"
7639,"The ASUS Zenbook 13 is actually available for $998.81 sold by Amazon, but doesn't ship until Feb. 4. Sadly, I don't think that there is any option that is as good for the price that ships faster. 

Although it is a lot less premium of a device, the Gateway 14.1"" for $449 would be an excellent bang for buck. The only downside is that Gateway is virtually unknown these days... you could consider holding onto it for a short time and selling it if you really want to get a more premium laptop like the ASUS Zenbook 13 when it is in stock."
7640,"Wow Gateway is a throwback! My first laptop ever was was a Gateway that I got in 2006.

Would you mind sharing a link to the Asus?"
7641,"It is on my list. You have to click ""New & Used (5) from $896.99"""
7642,"the lenovo flex 5 is no longer in the 500\~600 range, and you should remove it from the list"
7643,"It is normally $600, but only third parties are selling it currently. If you're quick, it does occasionally come back (only for a super short time). Like I've done in the past, I always place laptops that vary in price in the price bracket they are typically in."
7644,Can you give me any tips on how to find these third parties selling them? Do I look on Ebay? I want to get a lenovo flex 5 new for $600. How can I do this?
7645,"I mean that the people selling it on Amazon for $700+ currently are third parties. When Amazon themselves are selling it (aka, not third parties, directly from Amazon), they will sell it for $600. It is only on Amazon."
7646,"Ok thank you very much for the help. I will check the Amazon page you linked in the guide as much as possible. Thank you for the guide too, it has been very helpful to me. Also thank you for this subreddit, modding it, and posting great deals too. I am very thankful for all this and happy new year too."

7672,"Hi I’m looking for a laptop for dual use of light gaming/college schoolwork. I’m looking for a balance of everything. Medium size, medium weight, decent battery life with as much performance as I can get for my money. I don’t care about a 2 in 1, but an ssd would be nice.

7702,"Op, for a person like me who is looking for a laptop for school work (no gaming), if i could only pick one and I had to choose, what would I want to go for: a higher end cpu (ryuzen 7 or i7) or a higher ram (16gb). 

I find it hard to choose, because I don’t understand much, but I’ve been trying to look for a laptop with both features (high cpu and high ram), but they’re way out of my budget. 

I have seen the Lenovo flex and it caught my eye, but it’s 700+ (not $600 as you have listed), but I’m also concerned the ryuzen 5 isn’t enough on it. Again, I don’t understand much about specs here :/  I don’t want lag, and I don’t want to have to replace my laptop in the next 3-4 years due to updates slowing the computer down. 

What do you think?"
7703,"Hi, for school work, the Ryzen 5 4500U is plenty powerful. The Flex 5 14"" is typically $600 when Amazon themselves are selling it, but it has been mainly third parties for the time being. I think that more RAM is more important than a very strong CPU for general use. What is your budget?"
7704,"$600 is pretty much my absolute max and I’m pushing my budget just a bit ($600 and an additional roughly $50 for tax). 

I’ve heard of (and you’ve mentioned the pavillion hp laptops, but I feel their quality isn’t that great and I heard of many issues with the screen hinges"

7706,"Thanks for your recommendations! I’m definitely considering the Lenovo flex 5 though for the lighter weight, touch screen, and higher ram (although I could upgrade the idea pad you just mentioned). Also since you’ve stated it’ll be more than powerful with the ryuzen 5, I’m gonna go for it. Hope it lasts a while and that I enjoy using it! 

Only condition is that I buy it strictly for $600 though. I’m gonna keep an eye out for Amazon retail to be selling it and go for it. Thank you legos45!"

7709,Yep!
7710,"Planning on finally replacing my laptop once the stimulus check comes in, though I'm thinking I want to keep to $400 and below for my budget.

I don't do the fanciest stuff, but I'd like something that can handle running a few things at once without crapping itself. I'll usually have some music or Youtube running while I do work or art stuff, so being able to do that without something stuttering would be nice. I don't do much gaming on PC, but if there's something that can run stuff decently without breaking the bank, that's a nice bonus (but not crucial).

My current laptop is an Asus with 4GB of RAM and 465 GB of storage, so anything that beats that out is a huge plus."

7717,"Hi, I'd say that the price on it is okay, but not great. I think that virtually all budget laptops have the chance to randomly fail. That said, if you treat the laptop well, you will likely be fine, but it is important to keep in mind that budget laptops can be unpredictable."
7718,TY.  Might wait for a better sale.

7731,Please answer my other questions.
7732,Yeah  mostly for development purposes and also battery life matters
7733,"I'd say that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14"" or 15"" is your best bet if you can find them with the Ryzen 7 4800U, or you could wait for the Ryzen 5000 iterations of those laptops."

I've been eyeing the [Asus Zenbook 14](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultra-Slim-i5-1035G1-Thunderbolt-UX425JA-EB51/dp/B08KH9SX3G/ref=pd_ybh_a_4?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=P51TKX0M0BJB1TFRQ1YG&th=1) for nearly two months now (wish i pulled the trigger during the black friday deals). The i7-10 has been out of stock for awhile now on amazon, best buy, and asus website. I do notice that newegg appears to have it in stock (i find it odd they do but the other dont). My question, is there a major difference between the i7-10 and i7-11 - in terms of daily use and for long-term use. Do you think the i7-10 will come back in stock or is it just worth getting the i7-11?"
7735,"Hi, when it comes to single-core performance, the i7-1165G7 is quite a bit better, but realistically, it isn't going to make a big difference for general use. If you can work with a 13"" display and wait for it to drop back down to $999, it is a way better value because you get a stronger CPU, more RAM, and more storage."
7736,"Thanks for the comment!

As much as I would like the stronger CPU, more RAM, and more storage a 13' is too small. Do you think the 14' is a bad package?"

I don’t know a TON about laptops but I’ve been working with a Mac for the past 5-6 years and I think I want to switch to a PC laptop. I largely need it for both work and schoolwork (including video conferencing), and ability to multitask would be awesome. I would like to be able to do some fairly light gaming/watch things on my laptop as well. 

It doesn’t have to be super portable as it’ll generally be confined to my apartment, but I would prefer that it isn’t crazy heavy. I’m mostly pretty tired of my 2011 laptop running really slowly and would like to avoid that problem as much as I can. My budget tops out at around $1200.

7746,"I’d like for it to have a decent battery life if possible, but otherwise I’m very flexible!"
7747,"I see. Sticking with a Mac device would actually be a great choice simply because the MacBook Air has great performance with the Apple M1 chip, plus it has a great battery life. But, if you'd like to go with Windows, I'd go with the ASUS Zenbook 13 on my list. Most laptops with 11th gen Intel CPUs have great battery life because of their efficiency."

7757,"Hello! Could anyone point me in the right direction? I'm currently looking for a laptop very similar to this [Zenbook 14""](https://www.amazon.com/Zenbook-NanoEdge-Ultra-Slim-Keyboard-NumberPad/dp/B08J7QBD7C/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-nc-drs1_0?cv_ct_cx=laptop&dchild=1&keywords=laptop&pd_rd_i=B08J7QBD7C&pd_rd_r=1a131a24-475f-4082-84f5-944ae6ad5686&pd_rd_w=gSJY1&pd_rd_wg=puWIi&pf_rd_p=a64002b9-9c26-4361-b8a1-b0f5a4835670&pf_rd_r=33Z5HDHCMJG8XGF3NB8T&psc=1&qid=1610057629&sr=1-1-38d0a374-3318-4625-ad92-b6761a63ecf6). I purchased this exact laptop; however, I've had to return it due to many technical issues with the laptop such as not waking up from sleep mode and bluetooth headphone connectivity issues. I absolutely love everything about the laptop and I really love the 1TB of memory! My budget, though, lies somewhere within a maximum of $1000-1200. The Zenbook is perfect for this because it is small, light, has a fantastic keyboard, and offers perfect specs. I'm just too scared to buy from Asus again though. Does anyone have anything in mind? Thank you so much in advanced!"
7758,"Hi, I really don't think that there is as good of a device for the price from any other manufacturer... although it does not have as good of a display, nor does it have as much storage, this new configuration of the [**Acer Swift 3**](https://laptopsdeals.net/product/acer-swift-3-14-laptop-ryzen-7-4700u-16-gb-ram-512-gb-ssd-1080p-14-250-nit-ips/) would be a really good choice for the price."
7759,"Hey guys, decided to shop around for a laptop for just grad school. Looking at the 400-600 tier on the list, any suggestions? Don’t really know too much about current laptops as I’ve always worked on my PC"
7760,"Hi, how much do weight and battery life matter to you?"
7761,"I’ll be using this on the go and for studying, so definitely need a good battery life! As for weight, not really into paying the extra premium to get the lightest possible. Thanks"
7762,"I see. I'd say that the Gateway 14.1"" is the best choice on my list, but the brand is not very well known these days. The alternative is the ASUS Vivobook 14, and ASUS is more well known. The downside is that it has less RAM."
7763,"which brand, besides apple, might boast the best longevity? I want 16GB and have a decent \~$800-1200 price range, but want to be sure that it's got at least 5 years in it. could you help me out?"
7764,"Hi, my list doesn't include a lot of business grade laptops (since they rarely interest people), but they do have great reliability. The [**Lenovo ThinkPad E15**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/lenovo-thinkpad-e15-laptop-15-6-fhd-display-intel-core-i5-10210u-upto-4-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-nvme-ssd-hdmi-wi-fi-bluetooth-windows-10-pro/) is a solid choice if you're mainly doing general use tasks."
7765,"So Intel refuses to put the Intel graphics card sticker on the laptop unless the laptop has dual channel RAM. My question is what is the difference between the graphics of a laptop running an 11th Gen Intel chip with single channel RAM vs dual channel RAM?

Is it significant? Is it something to look for when purchasing a laptop?"
7766,"I'd say that it depends. If you have a dedicated GPU alongside the CPU, it is not a big deal, but otherwise, I'd say that having dual channel is important. I can't find a video comparing performance between the two, though."
7767,"I couldn't either, nor could I find any articles about it. Okay thanks a lot for the info. Will definitely look for for dual channel for the Intel graphics. 

Also since you're here what would you say is the best 14"" Windows laptop ATM. Ideally I'd get the new macbook air but I'd rather stay on the windows."
7768,"It very much depends on what you're looking for. There is no objectively ""best"" 14"" laptop because it depends on what you need."
7769,"Best as in all purpose laptop, light gaming, productivity, web browsing, good keyboard, trackpad, etc. For example I thought the Lenovo Slim 9i was perfect as it had the Intel Evo badge, slim, beautiful design, wifi 6, thunderbolt 4, etc. But turns out it performs horribly as the slim design doesn't allow for proper cooling and throttles the i7 chip hard. 

From the research I've done so far the razor book 13 seems to be the best but I don't think the value is there at $2000."
7770,"Actually, I think I know what the answer is. The new Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 14"" might just be the best 14"" laptop on the market. I've reviewed the IdeaPad 5 14"" myself (non-Pro version) and it handles its thermals pretty well. This new model is going to come with a Ryzen 5000 processor, up to MX450 graphics, 16 GB RAM, up to a 1 TB SSD, and most surprisingly, a QHD 90Hz 16:10 350 nit display.

7771,"Alright I guess I'm waiting for the ideapad 5 pro 14"""
7772,"Looking for a recommendation for a replacement for my water damaged laptop. I had an HP Pavilion that was great until my house flooded and now it’s shot. It was a five year old laptop so probably time to upgrade anyways. 

I’m just a casual user, mainly will be using it for research and work, with occasional streaming. The most demanding activity I’ll be doing with it is working on large, formula laden spreadsheets. Generally, I would say I prioritize durability over light weight/compactness but I also don’t want a brick of a laptop.

I would like to stay under $800 but I can stretch it up to $1200 if it’s REALLY worth the jump for my uses. I saw a Samsung Flex A at Best Buy that looked good and I loved the QLED screen but saw generally mixed reviews on it. I’m not the most tech savvy so I would love to hear some recommendations!"
7773,"Hi, how much does battery life matter to you?"
7774,"The longer the better, but it’s not a deal breaker if my other conditions are met"
7775,I see. It looks like I responded to your other comment with a recommendation already.
