10387,"Haha, that's one downside, yes. You need like 3 or 4 trays at the scanners."
10390,"I love that if you can afford it, the law doesn't apply to you.

EDIT: To those of you saying $100 isn't that bad, you are missing the point entirely.  Special treatment by institutions because you make more money is bullshit, period."
10391,"It's not exactly pay to play, though. As part of the application process you need to give them tons of important documents like your birth certificate, passport, drivers license, finger prints, retinal scan, etc. They verify your past residential, employment, criminal background and credit history. In exchange for giving up your privacy and 100 bucks (or zero if your airline status allows it), you apply for the program. I know a guy who applied, paid, and was denied due to past criminal history (drug possession conviction while in college). It's not as simple as ""pay $100 and skip the lines"".  They also have to accept you and approve you."
10392,Did you end up spending the next few days explaining to TSA why you were dressed so conspicuously?
10393,"Fun fact - European airport security tends not to be as aggressive as the TSA, and if you're travelling between EU countries you even get to use the special ""Blue Lanes"" at customs, where you basically walk through.

If you have one of those fancy biometric passports and the airport supports it you can even go through passport control by scanning your passport on a robotic gate, meaning you don't have to talk to any security officials."
10394,Frankfurt seemed quite a bit more aggressive than the U.S. pre-911.
10395,Germany has been more aggressive in general since the Munich Olympics.
10396,Or maybe they were just trying to make US passengers feel at home?
10397,"I guess different places do things differently. I know that Gatwick seems fairly lax, until you realize just how many cameras there are watching you. You get a full body photo at least twice while moving through security to make sure the person who goes through Security is the same person getting on the plane."
10398,"In Toronto, if you have a Canadian passport you can scan it to a computer without having to talk to border patrol. Makes things much faster."
10399,I had my whole bag unpacked and my body swabbed for explosives trying to board a flight in Germany. On my flight there from US they didn't so much as bat an eyelash at me.
10400,"On the way back, yeah, because I bought a sweet spaghetti pot that happened to cost me a few hundred dollars, so I wanted to bring it back with me. Wasn't about the pants, it was about the pot in my bags."
10401,/r/Frugal_Jerk
10402,The problem with the plastic cases is that they tend to be quite a bit heavier which isn't great for staying under the weight limit.
10403,"Yeah, you'll have to compromise about 7 of your hand grenades to make up for the extra weight of the case.

Is it a fair tradeoff? I'd say, maybe."
10404,Not if you're going to a CoD event. Then you need every grenade you can carry.
10405,Maybe you can only carry 2 grenades in CoD because of checked-baggage weight limits.
10406,"I just spent [$226](http://www.chiefsupply.com/pelican-carry-on-case-w-wheels-black.html?gclid=COGIgr-Sn74CFRQmMgod40EAQw) on a suitcase, and then another $40 to have my incredibly heavy luggage shipped.... but damnit, those TSA fuckers are not getting in my suitcase and taking my toothbrush!"
10407,You could also just try putting something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006C8TPNM) at the top of your packed belongings.
10408,Does it come with the shit stain?
10410,"Depends on where you are.  Flying back from Asia, they went through my bag and even nicely folded all my dirty underwear which had just been stuffed in the bag.  They certainly aren't afraid of a little dirty laundry."
10411,"Fortunately if they do get in they never take your toothbrush, or your camera."
10412,"All the stories I heard, they take both out and use them and put them back. Hopefully you didn't use your toothbrush before developing that film."
10414,That video was hilarious
10415,The WD40 was the point where I lost it.
10416,"and to the people calling him crazy

HE WAS JOKING."
10417,I laughed my ass off when he referred to people from the UK as being in a tribe.
10418,"hhahahah ""you brits probably don't know what this is, because your tribe likes to boil everything""

this guys humor is incredible"
10419,What the fuck
10420,"As a former baggage handler, I absolutely hated those big plastic suitcases.They were heavier, and if a nice soft leather suitcase hits you in the shin while you're stacking luggage in the pit, no biggie. One of these? You're out for a bit."
10421,"Brick, where did you get a hand grenade?"
10422,maybe you should stop putting in hand grenades in your checked luggage to stop having them stolen
10423,But what if you're going to Africa?
10424,Hunting?
10425,Fishing.
10426,Killing.
10427,...I gotta go hunting in Africa.
10428,"As a frequently traveler all over the world:

A) Don't check anything you don't want to be stolen.  They'll just take the whole fucking bag.  Just assume your shit will be stolen if you check it in a third world country.  

B) Try to pack a maximum sized carry on and have a backpack or shoulder bag.  You can easily pack for a week (5-7 days) in a carry on. Just roll your clothes.  Hell, I can pack 3 suits, 1 pair of shoes, and enough shirts, underwear, socks, etc for a week long trip.

C) Baggage handlers give less than two shits about your bag, so expect your bag to be damaged and or broken if you check it.

D) Pack as light as possible and buy shit at your destination if needed.  Sure, bring basic toiletries, but fuck it if it is more than 3oz and doesn't fit in your sandwich bag.  In your sandwich bag have toothpaste, shaving cream, hair gel or spray, and a small bottle of cologne if you'd like.  Just pack your SOLID deodorant, shavers, and toothbrush in your carry on.

E) Don't fuck with the TSA people.  They don't make the rules and make minimum wage...just do your shit and get through.  If it is so much of a fucking issue, pay your $80 and get Global Access and TSA Precheck.

F)  Don't bring shit you don't want to lose.  Unless you are sure your hotel has a safe, it could be stolen.  I've had shit stolen in 5 star hotels, so just assume it's going to grow legs, unless it is in a safe or on your body.

G) ALWAYS CARRY YOUR PASSPORT OR PUT IT IN A SAFE."
10429,TL;DR : Don't bring any luggage.
10430,"Stay in your house, nowhere is safe"
10432,"Pro safety tip: When fucking Africa, use protection."
10433,because AIDS
10434,TSA does not make minimum wage.. almost twice that.
10435,"> F) Don't bring shit you don't want to lose. Unless you are sure your hotel has a safe, it could be stolen. I've had shit stolen in 5 star hotels, so just assume it's going to grow legs, unless it is in a safe or on your body.

One issue with many hotels is that the locks they have in your room still have the default master password/number."
10436,"> they have in your room still have the default master password/number.

is this a known default master password?"
10437,"Known to at least some of hotel's employees, not necessarily public."
10438,I watched a video and the guy said the password on most is like 0000 or something like that no joke
10439,"The idea is to set it yourself, but most of the instructions are conveniently missing.

Oh and also most of those safes are really crappy, I mean you can bounce them on the bed and the door will pop on a good portion of them."
10440,"This product claims to solve that:

10442,Good advice but bear in mind that hotel safes are [notoriously easy to get into](http://supportspy.com/blog/archives/660).  Keep important items with you and make a copy of your passport to store separately.  There are plenty of sites offering good tips about [how to stay safe when traveling](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/5-travel-security-tips.htm/printable).  Do your research before you leave.
10444,Approximately 2/3 of a shit.
10445,"I don't know, it could be 1.5."
10446,3/5 anybody?
10447,You should also remember that hotel safes aren't necessarily safe. Hotel staff may have a master code to the safes. Also when I'm traveling outside Europe I have a printed copy of my passport & scanned version in my email.
10448,Global Access is now $100
10449,"""You can reach in there and pull out the hand grenades--"" wait, what?"
10450,Africans stealing my hand grenades has been a common problem for a while.
10451,"**DO NOT BUY OR USE THAT STYLE OF LOCK.**

They are extremely easy to unlock, requiring no effort or guesswork.  By applying downward pressure to the locking ring, pulling on it as you would to open it, you force the dials to stop rotating at their ""unlock"" position.  Basically all you'd have to do is pull on it, turn the dials until they stop, release tension and pull again.  I learned this lesson young at summer camp when the counselors found all the shit I smuggled in that I wasn't supposed to have (it was all candy and soda.)"
10452,Heavyweights (movie)?
10453,i hid all my illicit treats in the blob
10454,"Dinner's been canceled, due to lack of hustle."
10456,Finally my hand grenades will be safe
10457,"Everything about flying these days is security theatre, especially those stupid little TSA locks."
10458,"Live on Broadway!   
It's the biggest musical everyone is talking about!   
""TSA on Ice!"""
10459,Put that thing back where it came from or so help me.
10461,Or take anything worth high value with you as a carry on.
10462,"Or, I have one better for you.

Let's say you are traveling with some expensive camera equipment, and you want to pack that - but you also want to have other expensive items in your carry on.

Go to Walmart and buy a $40 starter pistol. Then put the pistol in the bag with your camera equipment. When you arrive at the airport, tell them that you have a firearm to declare. Here's the best part. You don't have to have any type of license for a starter pistol, but it must be checked as a firearm. They will give you a form to fill out, then that bag must be taken directly to the aircraft and locked up with the pilot."
10463,"I imagine the stars aligning and a particular flight where all passengers on board have read this tip somewhere and the cabin is just filled to the brim with suitcases.

Made me chuckle anyway."
10464,"Well it will actually be stored with the other luggage, can you imagine pilots having to babysit passenger's luggage?

 Also the case has to be hard-sided, so no cloth or canvas luggage for your firearms."
10465,"That would only work with domestic flights in the United States though....       
You can't carry fire arms on international flights, even if they're checked in."
10466,How do guys that go on hunting trips to SA or Africa get their guns to come with them? Ship it via FedEx? Or do you just rent one from the group you are traveling with?
10467,There are airfreight companies that can deal with airport to airport shipping. It costs heaps of money but I'd imagine that would be an option when travelling with hunting rifles
10468,"Lets hope you aren't flying to the UK then as your destination, as that wont work."
10469,"As a thief, I would expect a suitcase like this to have contents of significantly higher value. I would feel more intrigued to take the suitcase or something."
10470,"""Oh sweet suitcase, oh no too bad it fell off this conveyor belt"" *mine!*"
10471,"It is good advice, but I have just found it easier not to travel with my hand grenades."
10472,I usually buy a crate of fresh grenades when I arrive at my destination.  Nothing like that new grenade smell.
10473,I have never in my life once thought that a padlocked zipper was to prevent theft - I always assumed it was to prevent the zipper from being accidentally pulled open during the transit process. What kind of fucking idiot thinks that that little lock would prevent a determined thief from getting into your luggage?
10474,"> What kind of fucking idiot thinks that that little lock would prevent a determined thief from getting into your luggage?

Its not to keep a determined thief out, its to get the opportunistic, lazy thief to target the next bag rather than yours."
10475,"That's exactly it.  It's to keep away lazy thieves.  It's the same principle with car locks, door and window locks on your home, and security software on your phone and computer.  The thief who knows what they're doing will have absolutely zero issue with those deterrents but a less than ambitious one will probably say fuck it and move on to the next one."
10476,"Yeah and, there are a lot more casual, opportunistic thieves then there are professional thieves who really know what they're doing."
10477,"it's usually not necessary to keep james bond out, but only to be a harder target than the next suitcase for some asshat looking for a free ipad."
10478,"Have to agree with the people who point out that if this guy checked a big pelican case with two huge padlocks on it, it's going to get searched, they're going to cut his expensive locks, and it's quite possible he'll get robbed anyway.

The best thing to do if you're carrying something expensive is to include it in your carry-on so it doesn't leave your sight.  Barring that, have an theft insurance policy on whatever you're bringing."
10479,Sounds like Nicholas Cage
10480,"I have the oldest piece of crap samsonite hard shell suitcase, one if the latches is broke and I use duct tape to keep it closed. Everytime I check it, it gains a sticker from TSA with new tape over my tape cause it's obviously suspicious. But to the baggage handler thief it looks like a total waste of time, and where would they get the TSA tape to replace the tampering."
10481,"As news sources have pointed out, the TSA is often the one stealing your stuff..."
10482,Was this hosted by Ron Swanson?
10483,"""We lost your bag."""
10484,"nobody actually thinks it's safe

in chinese there's a saying: it's to guard against gentlemen and not against thieves"
10485,"In Indonesia, we have luggage wrapper service, basically covering the whole luggage with plastic wraps. Two bucks for one item."
10486,protip: zip-tie the lock to the handle so they dont move the zipper.
10487,Or zip tie the pull ring of your grenade to the zipper. Surprise motherfucker.
10488,they would just break the zip tie
10489,I like this guys way better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI-YYWDYXJ4
10490,"Nobody is going to open a backpack on the strip, they will just grab it and run. Keep your backpack on you and you'll be fine. Set it down, and no lock will protect it."
10491,"If your bag has a zipper to close it, no lock will secure it.

https://youtu.be/9JvmAktLvFg"
10492,Simple and Fast... I like it... (paranoia continues to grow) LOL
10493,"What are you trying to protect in the first place?

Keep your personal belongings (keys, money, cellphone) on your person.

Utilise your hotel safe for the stuff you leave in your room. We're all aware that they are not really safe, but they don't have to. There are so many tourists/hotel rooms in Vegas to choose from, just don't be the lowest hanging fruit"
10494,"> We're all aware that they are not really safe, but they don't have to.

I was under the impression they're reasonably secure against random burglars, and hotel staff would need to swipe ID to enter so if they open the safe to steal they'll quickly be caught, fired, and prosecuted."
10495,This is a conference where they teach (and sell equipment for) how to clone RFID cards.
10496,https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/10/evil_maid_attac.html
10497,"When I expect to be in crowded areas/lines (airports, tourist attractions, etc) while wearing my backpack, I just use a paper clip or twist tie to close the zippers together. My theory is that anyone would have to fumble with it enough to get it open, and theoretically I'd notice. Probably moreso than someone with a TSA key, plus then I have to carry around a key."
10498,If you pick the tsa locks they don’t change color. Would not buy those ones
10499,Just legally transport a firearm in your checked baggage. There are pretty strict laws about who can unlock your baggage if you have properly declared a firearm.
10500,"You just have to fill out a form, you don't need to actually put a gun in the case."
10501,"Just put an unloaded flare gun in there, it counts."
10502,What do you mean? To show tamper or access?
10503,If you open them using the tsa key it changes color. If you shove two tools in there and twist it does not. So i guess i would say access but both really bc technically it is a tamper evident device.
10504,"Ahh gotcha, thanks.

Any you would recommend?"
10505,"Nope sorry, just cautioning against those other kinds"
10506,"TSA approved ones, nobody's ever robbed me or taken anything from me on the strip. Hotels will check your bags for a fee so if you check out at noon but your flight isn't until 11 pm they can hold it for you."
10507,Where r u hiking from?
10508,"I just use one of them TSA approved locks for my checked bag, the lock has the green dot which turns to RED when the TSA uses the key to open it. Haven't had any problems since buying it, possibly 5-6 years ago by now."
10509,Are you staying with strangers?
10510,Do we ever really know people??? Lmao... no I'm not I dont like the new hotel policy thst they inspect the room every day
10511,"Personally the only locks i use are ""BEST"" locks. 7 pins, pinned/modified by me.   


They can be picked, but even people more skilled than myself take >10 minutes to pick them.  


Those keep a pelican case closed. I use two of them with different key/types (best locks have many different keyways based on the letter of keyway the lock has (Like there is a key A and a key B, and they could have the same pinouts, but fit different keyways. Its actually really neat)"
10515,"It's fine to check your box as well. Just include a firearm in the box. 

If you're checking firearms, TSA requires that the box and contents be checked with you present, then locked up with a non-TSA lock. Basically a box with guns is about the only case where they'll care that your property won't be ""misplaced"" after it goes down the conveyor."
10516,"I read on a gun forum that someone had the habit of bringing a starter pistol with him when he flew. I thought it was kind of silly until I saw someone check a firearm a few weeks later. They don't fuck around.

I thought it was kind of a nifty idea then."
10517,And a starter pistol qualifies as a gun for the TSA's purposes. I know photographers that keep a starter pistol in each of their camera cases.
10519,"So that the actual valuable camera isn't tampered with as part of the alternate bag check procedure.

As the comments above you in this chain point out: if you are carrying a firearm (or even a ""starter pistol"" that can not fire a projectile) then you get a special bag check procedure that occurs while you are present."
10520,And real padlocks.
10521,"This is the real feature. You *have* to use a non-tsa lock. That means tsa can't look inside and misplace something. 

Also losing a firearm is a big deal so you don't have to worry as much about them losing your luggage."
10522,lol you really think they won’t rip it open to check the contents?
10523,"Yes, that's specifically the point of this technique is that, *NO*, they won't rip it open when you're not present. It could land them in some *serious* and real trouble for doing so.

They've already searched the contents while you were present, so they know what's in the bag."
10524,They specifically will not open firearm cases without the owner being present.  Searches are done separate from the rest of checked baggage before the firearms case enters the bag system.
10525,"Because guns are the only thing TSA will actual lift a finger to keep from getting stolen by their own shitty, criminal employees."
10526,"Tim Ferriss suggested this in his book ""The 4-Hour Chef"". He may have gotten it from someone else."
10528,Well yeah. His books are compilations of things he has learned. Not things that he invented out of nothing.
10529,That or a flare gun
10530,I was going to add that. I've heard of using flare guns or starter pistols.
10531,Brb getting myself a travel Hi-Point
10532,"Deviant Ollam has several great talks on TSA keys/locks, elevators and penetration testing, and the mentioned firearms in luggage when flying (especially with tech or expensive gear).

10534,"But all bags travel on the same plane as its owner! /s

I might start doing the firearm thing.

Not too long ago I had nothing to do so I got to the airport way early. Once inside security I noticed I had plenty of time to make an earlier flight. So I went to the customer unsupport desk and the lady told me since I already checked my bag there was nothing they could do. As I'm sitting on the plane waiting to take off I get a text that my bag had arrived.....on the fucking flight I wanted to be on. Then when I arrived I find out my bag was at a terminal like a mile away (ok, not that far but it was a bit of a walk)"
10535,are they illegal in any state/city? it would be a shame to be tripped up in someone stupid like DC or NYC.
10536,Yes. You’re screwed if you land in New Jersey. It is known that they will wait to arrest you when you claim your bag.
10537,"If your flight is diverted into NJ, you REFUSE to claim your bag. You do not place one finger on a bag containing a firearm. You tell the airline to put you, and your bag, on the next flight outta that shithole state."
10538,"really? how would they know, or do they just wait and see if you have the correct permits/paperwork?  maybe something like a 50bmg bottle opener?"
10539,"They know there’s a firearm in the bag since it was checked by TSA on the departure side. So the authorities know it’s your bag and once you claim it on the arrival side you get arrested. Basically their argument is that you should know the rules of the state you are flying into. 

Happens with people driving through New Jersey as well. They don’t recognize other states permits so if you are pulled over and caught with your handgun, you’ll be arrested and charged with a felony. It’s actually a huge problem."
10541,"NJ and NY ignore FOPA.

There is no 2A in those states from the cops to the prosecutors to the judges."
10542,You have a gun on you while you sleep? Maybe you have a problem.
10544,Are you a cia operative or just paranoid?
10545,A gun by the bed helps you feel safe when the dishes settle in the middle of the night.
10546,"If that's what makes you feel safe, then you do have a problem. I truly hope it doesn't take accidentally shooting someone you love to make you realize you are making the world infinitely LESS safe by walking around like 8 year old pretending you're a cowboy. It's not 1860 and no one's out to get you. I'd say I wonder how many more school shootings it's gonna take before people say enough is enough but it's clear you could have a shooting every day and no one would bat an eye...but keep telling yourself that it's normal, and all those dead kids are worth you feeling good about your dishes."
10547,Thought that I wouldn't need the /s considering how ridiculous my statement was.
10549,"Right then, I'll file that under paranoid. Thanks for making the world a more dangerous place for everyone around you."
10550,"Bingo, hard case with a single shot .22 or starter pistol. TSA doesn't care if their ghetto trash staff steal your iPad, but they care when guns disappear."
10551,"Heck, go pay $50-$60 for a ""stripped lower reciever"" for an AR-15, it's the part of the firearm that's legally the gun. But there's nothing to make it work. No barrel, bolt, chamber, trigger assembly, or even stock. Just a piece of machined metal that the BATFE legally considers a gun."
10552,"Don't even need to go that far. TSA treats ammunition the same as a firearm, although I've heard the rounds must be in their own hard sided ammo box. So for the cost of a box of .22 and a $5 ammo holder, you should be able to check your TSA approved, locked hard case just as you would any other firearm."
10553,Or just pack an unloaded magazine. I learned the hard way that is also considered a firearm.
10554,No bueno for certain states.
10555,Strictly speaking the box with the firearm can not include anything else but the firearm and accessories. So you can not pack a box with a lower receiver and your laptop. You would have to ship the laptop separately. However in practice you can get away with this unless you are quite ridiculous.
10556,Great video on traveling with guns. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfqtYfaILHw
10557,This is the real LPT : ship your shit.
10558,"Actually come to think of it, shipping a bag might cost a lot less than the bag fees major airlines charge."
10559,"You’re in for a rude awakening, friend"
10560,"I recently shipped 50 lbs of possessions via UPS and it cost $100, so not really cheaper than checking a 50 lb suitcase. Though amtrak does have some good deals on transporting stuff if you're willing to drop it off and pick it up from your closest amtrak stations."
10561,Saves you hauling 50 Lb around the airport i guess.
10562,"At least two airports actually.  And it's convenient if you have a late flight but have to check out of your hotel by noon.   Not cheap, but the convenience can be worth the extra cost in some circumstances."
10563,Truth
10564,"Well, nope."
10565,"Depends how much shit you have, I bring a backpack for trips more than two weeks. $0 bag fees. Depends what airline you have and you obviously have to go through the inconvenience of having to go and pick up your luggage and then re shipping back when you come back, extra stuff you have to do."
10566,"Domestically maybe. International, hell no. Try sending a bag across the Atlantic, all of a sudden business class becomes the more economical option."
10567,"$26.25 after taxes for air Canada, $50 for a second bag, and then $100 for a third, with a $50 or $100 overweight fee for things over 70 pounds. Yeah it's most likely cheaper to cargo ship it"
10568,"As always the real LPTs are either in the comments or in the /r/undelete/ sub. The TSA can, will, and is mandated to open your bags and check them. If you put a padlock on your bag they will either open the zipper as descibed above or they will straight up cut the lock or even cut open the bag itself if needed.

Do not put anything you would be exceptionally upset to lose in checked baggage. This includes valuables, electronics, medicines, gifts, etc... Ship it via UPS or USPS, and insure it if it's exceptionally valuable."
10569,"If there's anything that border security on Netflix taught me, it's that this doesn't always work out too great"
10570,"UPS worker here, can confirm Pelican cases can take a beating."
10571,Also if you really want to you can take the lower from a firearm and put it in there. Technically a firearm in a sense of law so it can be locked and TSA can't say shit
10572,Nope. Worked for an airline. Seen TSA do all kinds of B'S. Even made a gal open her bag in baggage claim because her vibrator was going off.
10573,I work in international logistics. This does NOT apply for international flgihts as my companies prices are often 1/3 of an international plane ticket for a small parcel.
10574,TSA can and will cut locks if they want in your pelican case. Sometimes they will even damage the bag even if they aren't supposed to open it. In the vase where you're transporting a gun for example.
10575,I'm talking about shipping your shit via UPS or FedEx or USPS.
10576,"Flat Rate Boxes are where it's at. If you're smart about it, you can fit a weeks worth of clothes into a medium flat rate box."

10578,"Padlocks are just to discourage petty, opportunistic theft. Most bags are made of fabric so can really be 'opened' with a sharp knife or pair of scissors."
10579,"For sure. Those locks are the ""keep honest people honest"" type of security."
10580,That's why I have a lock on my bag when I travel.
10581,I have a lock on mine so I don't find the contents spilled all over the conveyor belt when I go to pick up my bag.
10582,"The thing if you have a pen, then to you a bag with a padlock is just as easy to open as a bag without. (In most cases) 

So in theory having no padlock will probably do a better job of discouraging petty theft than having one as it makes it seem like you don’t carry any valuables. 

Also if your bag comes to you sliced open (someone used a knife) then you have evidence of tampering by airport workers. However if someone opens the zipper like I described, there is no evidence."
10583,"Yeah but that's not how it will work. The people who plan on stealing will find a way to steal it, but some people who don't plan it at all will see there's no padlock and think why not just quickly taken something."
10584,"The people who plan on stealing will find a way to steal *from bags they suspect have valuables in them,* when there is opportunity, or both.  When you put a padlock on, it creates extra motive to steal from you while offering like 4 s worth of additional deterrance compared to no lock at all.  There are videos of people using ink pens to open locked zippers all over the place and they do it in about as much time as it takes to open an unlocked zipper."
10585,"Just because there are videos of them doing it all over the place doesn't mean it actually happens a lot. If you have valuables and you put a padlock on it you're saying those small amount of theives might potentially see your bag and may do this technique. If you have valuables and don't put a pad lock on, the larger amount of people who aren't theives but see a super easy opportunity will steal your valuables. The latter will be more likely to happen. Plus the people who use your technique could very easily also try checking your bag that doesn't have a padlock on it. Not putting a padlock is just plain stupid."
10586,"The thieves you worry about in most situations don't exist in airports.  No run of the mill thief is going to open my bag in an airport because it is with me all the time except for when it is possessed by airport employees.  In this scenario, the only thieves to worry about are airport employees and those thieves rely on having access to everyone's bag with no oversight or immediate oversight that is corrupt.  For them, it isn't a question of getting easy access to anyone's bag as they have access to everyone's.  They have to decide which bags to open as they get to pick and choose which bags are worth looking inside.  In this case, a padlock is an attractant and a non-factor as a deterrent."
10587,"Um what? Do you not know what baggage claim is? There aren't many people who put locks on bags that they're going to be carrying all the time. They put locks on the ones that will be put into the luggage compartment and they'll have to pick up from baggage claim. That's where the random people will be looking for their bag and then see a bag without a lock and ""check to see it's theirs"" before taking something and putting it back."
10588,nah man. that's not how it works. give up.
10589,">having no padlock will probably do a better job of discouraging petty theft

That's not how it works"
10590,Wouldn't the evidence be that you have stuff missing from your luggage?
10591,How would you prove that you had it there in the first place ?
10592,"Make a video of you packing the bag, then close it with a numbered seal similar to those used to seal semi truck trailers. Take a photo of you checking it into the airport and it going on the checked bag area, with the numbered seal clearly visible and readable on video. The seal will be removed by TSA and you will have video evidence that your item was in fact in the bag when it was taken into the checked bag area.


Huge pain in the ass though."
10593,"Even middle class bags have the lock attached to the bag these days, so you couldn't close it without actually opening the lock. While totally possible, it's a lot more time consuming."
10594,Protect the contents of your travel bags by hiding inside the bag so you can catch anyone who tries to steal your stuff red handed.
10595,Ah the real tip is always in the comments.
10596,I simply attach a small explosive to the opening mechanism so if someone tried to open it they are in for a rude awakening.
10597,And TSA will cut the wrap. Had happened to me the past 3 times going from US to Brazil.
10598,I was wondering about that because every travel wrap stand I've seen is outside of security.
10599,"And have a fabric sleeve over them. Get to Brazil customs  no plastic wrap, but the sleeves."
10600,"Your bags got checked on the way to Brazil?!  I've never had issues on the way to Brazil, only on the way back into the US."
10601,Every time out of Orlando....
10602,"Ahh, I wonder if it's because how many Brazilians buy stuff there and fly back.  I usually go through Atlanta."
10603,That's my smuggler wife...will have a bag full of cosmetics and Polo/Hilfiger shirts. And sell the bag too.
10604,I hear you - add Carter's and Victoria's Secret to that list too.
10605,"LPT: clothes/toiletries only in your checked bag, valuables/electronics in your carry on. Then you'll never worry or care if someone has opened your checked bag"
10606,Yea not sure why I would really care if a TSA agent wanted to browse through 7 pairs of dirty underwear
10607,Because they're not paying you for the pleasure?
10608,"It still sucks when they steal not-so-valuable stuff. When I flew to Argentina, I had my brand new adidas sandals and dress shoes stolen out of my luggage (I had a lock). Both were inexpensive but I needed those items so I was pretty pissed."
10609,"The problem isn't them opening your checked bag. It's someone in a back room opening your checked valuables and then your suitcase shows up ""unopened"" but without your stuff.

Edit: I can't read that's exactly what you said."
10610,"The key to restoring a bag after compromising the zipper is the ability to freely pass the zipper back over the opened area. If your bag as a secondary “lock holder” point then you can secure the zippers to a point in the bag making it more difficult to restore it without evidence. eBags actually does this on their house brand bags. 

Another method I use with a lock is a low strength brightly colored zip tie through the zippers. This allows for quick identification if your bag has been opened by security outside of your presence. I have done this on pelicans and suitcases and generally makes for a failsafe check on inspection. I have even had TSA replace a zip tie with their own after inspection (generally only with pelicans). Just removed to either have a small nail clipper on an exterior pocket or ask a hotel front desk for a pair of scissors, if the zip tie is small enough it is also possible to use the lock as leverage and break the tie as well."
10611,I never understand why people pay to have there bags travel wrapped. Surely it just looks like you have something to hide? As long as you have travel insurance you’re covered anyway.
10612,">As long as you have travel insurance you’re covered anyway.

Some things can't be replaced by insurance. What if they don't steal enough to meet the deductible?"
10613,isn't it just up to the person who was stolen from to make up a number though?
10614,Sentimental value is hard to substantiate to insurance.
10615,"Not usually. You have to provide a list of what was stolen, and the insurance people will decide how much that stuff is worth."
10616,"*Ah yes, my bag of palladium bullion*"
10617,so i cant just put on a list that I had a laptop in there? or like an expensive watch :P
10618,"Sure, if you want to risk a fraud charge."
10619,Can you prove you own those things?
10620,avoiding the hassle of insurance claims and having to replace all the crap that was stolen is worth something.
10621,I just do it because I use one of those hard/shell bags. The wrap is to keep everything together *in case* the bag breaks.
10622,"Travel insurance can be finicky when it comes to lost or stolen luggage in transit. They would rather the airline or airport paid, and the airline or airport would rather the insurance company paid. So you can end up in the middle of a dispute about who is liable.

Also, if you're carrying anything remotely valuable, the limits on travel insurance for luggage are often too low, so you'll want supplementary insurance for those items."
10623,"Aren't luggage locks designed to be cut/broken relatively easily? It's to prevent an inspector having to damage your luggage to get inside.

The locks are meant to discourage petty/opportunistic theft only."
10624,"Those are ""tsa approved"" locks. They also have a master key you can 3d print or get for $5 at the store. Use a real lock."
10625,Use a real lock as long as you're not going to places the TSA operate. They may cut off the lock or slice open bags they can't unlock. (https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2014/02/18/tsa-travel-tips-tuesday-tsa-recognized-locks).
10626,"Somewhere abroad, somebody decided not take cut the TSA lock, but to cut the eyelets of the pelican case. let say that I was not amused."
10627,Real lock anyways. A lock where everyone has a key isn't a lock.
10628,TSA locks are the worst locks in the world.
10629,"Yeah, but at least you'll know if it has been opened. Unless they bothered to force the shackle back in palce, which can absolutely be done with the cheap small ones. But unlocked zippers tempt someone way more than a crappy padlock that requires a bit more work to get open. 

Same for your house lock, it can absoluetly be opened, the goal is to make it difficult and time-consuming, so someone will be less likely to try.

There's a suitcase belt, that looks like a car seatbelt, that can be opened by TSA, but it will have an indicator showing that it had been opened. There's a steel cable sort of thing as well. These things don't protect your luggage, but will let you know if it has been tampered with."
10630,"He's talking about someone forcing open the zipper, not the lock."
10631,The little locks are intended to connect two zipper pulls - preventing them from separating and the luggage opening.
10632,Tutorials on how to break in with a pen are all over YouTube. https://youtu.be/wpIJVWXsBBI
10633,"what an awful video. 4:06 long, need to skip to 3:53 for the actual content. ugh"
10634,So like most YouTube videos.
10635,"Before you watch this 5 second tutorial, make sure you spend 4 minutes subscribing to my channel!"
10636,Lmao... 4min long video for 10 seconds of relevant content. Gotta love YouTube these days.
10637,These days? Youtube tutorials have *always* been like that.
10638,"It's not about breaking in.

 Ever had a broken zipper or your jeans?"
10639,"It’s easy to break in most cases.

Try pressing on it with a pen and see for yourself."
10640,I think he’s just stating that they are used to stop all your contents spilling everywhere.
10641,Yep. That’s exactly what I was saying.  Cheers!
10642,"I use vacuum plastic bags for travel packing. 

I LOVE those things. I use them for my seasonal wardrobe change outs too, since I store in a cellar type place. Keeps out odors and damp, accidental flooding/water damage, etc. & saves TONS of space in all cases."
10643,"I'm a ramp agent working with baggage every day, travel film is awful.

There are 2 of us in the baggage hold, one to pass from the door to the end and one to stack. On bigger planes it is quite a distance and you can have 200 22kg bags to load. A lot of bags have 4 wheels now and are super easy to roll down, they always get the lightest treatment. Hard shell cases are better than soft shell as they provide better frame for handling and stacking. Then you have the travel film that stops the bag sliding and the only option to to fucking launch it down like you're doing shot put at the Olympics.

Seriously, a hard shell suitcase with 4 wheels will prevent a lot of potential damage.

NO FILM"
10644,"Good points. Never thought of that. I suppose people could stick wrapping tape just over their zippers, along with a lock, to discourage thieves, while still letting inspectors in."
10645,I use one of those cheap ass “diary” padlocks (or sometimes a string) just to make sure the zipper doesn’t open  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10646,"You dropped this \

10647,"Good bot, but I’ll accept my life as an amputee"
10648,"Also remember, if you lock your backpack to the luggage rail in a train or bus, and you can’t see it all the time, don’t do it in the shoulder pads. A thief can easily just take the straps out and take the backpack."
10649,People do this?
10650,"I was on a train in Sri Lanka, there were a girl who got her backpack stolen that way."
10651,"If you lock a bag to a rail in a train station or bus stop, then won't security just assume it is a bomb and destroy it?"
10652,"Maybe, but this was on the train."
10653,"Or use something like Pacsafe, which is a wire mesh of steel cable that goes over your backpack or suitcase."
10654,"Ok, this comes from my expericence (it’s not a lot) if you’re on vacation, leave your better stuff at home, fancy-brand clothing/accessories they’re not that important on travel and there’s always the possibility of missing/damaging the items and maybe no insurance to cover. Everything like laptops/tablets and phones are better in the hand luggage.

Last time I traveled I avoided the luggage alltogether (just had my hand luggage and a small bag)... But then police got suspicious because it’s unusual for someone traveling and not overstock at the duty free or *not having a luggage* (apparently here in Europe everybody stocks their luggages while abroad).

Yeah, I still put the lock on my send-in luggage, it’s not for thieves but for me, I recognize my bag better and it is still holding the zip on place."
10655,"They should make a transparent travel bag save all the trouble of checking, bet it'll sell like hot cakes!"
10656,"I don't want all the other travelers to know I'm traveling with a very large bottle of sex lube, though. 


Now, if I wasn't madly in love with my wife, and not married, I probably would, heh"
10657,"I haven't flown in about 2 years, so not sure if this has changed, but TSA will cut padlocks off your luggage.  I had left the little padlock on one of my zipper tabs not even connecting it to any of the other tabs and TSA cut the tabs off of all my zipper tabs.  Made it a pain in the ass to open and close my luggage."
10658,"I hope the real LPT is to make your bag more difficult to get into than the next bag they see.

Same goes for anything, be it your house, your car, etc. Make it less appealing or more difficult than your neighbors."
10659,Also a tip: most TSA approved keyed padlocks have an unshielded shackle so they can be opened by anything long and skinny. Just so you don’t think that TSA approved Padlock actually keeps your stuff safe.
10660,"Just also an FYI, those tiny TSA and luggage locks are pathetic.  Not only can I clip it in half with pliers, but it’s the easiest lock to pick ever.  I can pick it with a gum wrapper probably."
10661,Yea but you now have proof your bag was tampered with between point A and point B.
10662,A lock on luggage just tells thieves you have something worth protecting. Which means it's probably worth stealing.
10663,"I use a zip tie passed through the zipper holes & handle of the bag as well.

And I just don't put anything of value in the bags either. I've seen how they get tossed around."
10664,"Came here to say this.

I don't put valuables in my hold luggage, I just stick a cable tie through the zips to stop accidental opening, discourage petty theft and check if my bags been inspected."
10665,LifeProTips *for criminals lol
10666,Lpt: use shitty luggage and dont bring expensive shit. Then it won't look worth breaking into. You won't care of they do. And if it gets lost its easily replaced.
10667,"That's like saying don't lock your house or car, they can just break a window.  Or don't like your bike, they can bring a lock cutter. 

A lock is still a good deterrant for someone just checking to see if bags are unzippable/easy access.  Someone stabbing a pen in a bag will be more obvious and take more work.

Locks keep honest people honest. If someone wants something there are ways they can get it regardless of locks."
10668,Locks keep honest people out.
10669,"If you're checking a bag, you don't really want to lock it.  TSA is going to break anything they can easily open.

Not saying it's right, but it's how they work."
10670,Somebody is watching bosnianbill on youtube.
10671,"In my opinion, if they really want to get in your bag, they will no matter what."
10672,"Been traveling internationally since the 70s. Visited about 25 countries. 15 of the years often with wife and kids. Not once anything stolen. Always followed three rules. First, never check anything worth stealing. Second, always “lock”my checked bag with twisty bag ties. I assumed a lock is no more secure than the tie, but the latter prevents accidental opening and is a signal there is nothing inside worth stealing. Third, carry anything valuable and keep it close.

Once or twice it looked like maybe somebody had opened a checked bag but nothing was missing."
10673,yup. i 100% agree with this. i traveled for work to many countries and all over the US. the worst thing that should happen is that you need to get new clothes. anything more valuable should be shipped and insured.
10674,"I don’t think anyone actually thinks these locks will stop someone truly motivated from stealing anything. 

They just prevent opportunistic thieves and prevent your bag from coming open and spilling everywhere if one of the pulls gets caught or snagged. 

Concealed zippers and travel film won’t prevent any motivated thief either. 

Kind of a poor LPT"
10675,How to break open a travel bag with a pen is going to be a ULPT by the end of the day.
10676,"I never take a bag, i just go as i am with a spare pair of pants in my pocket."
10677,"Wait, couldn't they just rip the film, steal your stuff, then wrap it back up in travel film?"
10678,"Sure, throw a few meters more of completely unnecessary plastic out into the world that you are ""using"" for a couple hours."
10679,"Better yet, never travel and stay inside forever."
10680,"Take anything valuable, including data, in your carry-on."
10681,It's odd that people are discussing theft here...  Those crappy little locks aren't going to stop anyone remotely determined.  Plus it's a complete free-for-all at the baggage recaim if someone really wants to steal something!
10682,Could you theoretically seal your own suitcases with shrink wrap and tape rather than pay for it at the airport?
10683,"The TSA is going to break whatever lock you have anyway, then include a note about how they’re sorry they had to do it but they aren’t responsible."
10684,Though if you wrap your bag they/ thieves know there is something in that bag that you want otherwise you wouldn't have bothered.
10685,"The goal is not to run faster than the lion, just faster than the person next to you"
10686,"Although there are a few manufacturers where that trick doesn't work, zippers on bags are a constant nuissance anyway, usually that's what breaks first. Hard shells with latches is the way to go anyway. Sure, given enough time and the necessary tools, you'll get those open as well but if it's security who's stealing, there's not too much you can do about it anyway as far as the type of bag is concerned.

Travel film makes sense when going to some destinations because you can tell if the bag has been tampered with. It's not so much what has been taken from your bag but what has been added to it. Coming back from Colombia and the film has been removed? Off to customs and tell them, that's the kind of stuff that can make the difference between sleeping at home that night and a jail cell."
10687,But how would they run the puller over it if the puller is locked by a padlock?
10688,"What kind of shitty ass bags are you using that you can break the zip with a pen?

LPT: don't buy shitty bags with shitty zips"
10689,"If someone thinks that my old-ass band t shits, crusty underwear and work boots are worth stealing, knock yourself the fuck out. My electronics and laptop goes with me in my carry on."
10690,"I'll also add that anyone I roll my clothes up in my pelican case, it ALWAYS ends up being ""randomly"" selected for TSA inspection. Weird"
10691,"I learned it is not to keep people from getting your stuff out, but to keep them from putting illegal stuff in."
10692,https://youtu.be/tbpKhHwwtiY?t=53s
10693,I just use my duffle bags and a non tsa padlock.
10694,Buy bags that come with double zippers.. they can’t be open end up with sharp objects
10695,I'm guessing you know just the place I can get this magic film of which you speak?
10696,"I see wrapping services in most airports. Its about 15 us dollars equivalent. Though i bet people could just use shrinkwrap and tape.

That said, a baggage handler here said wrapping is a bad idea as it inconveniences handlers and requires them to chuck baggage around to overcome the lack of moving wheels, poor friction etc."
10697,I wouldn't want to give them more reason to chuck my stuff.
10698,"The best advice I heard was to FedEx your bags to the hotel you're staying at and only carry a change of clothes in a bag for overhead storage.

It was stated that hotels accommodate people who FedEx their bags and FedEx is so much more secure and reliable than airlines and can be cheaper."
10699,"Good advice for domestic travel, but far more trouble and expense for international."
10700,Where are you flying?  Anyone who wants to get into your luggage will anyway.  Just don't put anything valuable in them.  The TSA keys are widely available.
10701,"Generally padlocks are to protect your luggage at your accomodation (e.g. a hostel), or when it might be sitting somewhere venerable (e.g. waiting for you in a storage area/sitting on a train etc).
If there's a chance of your zips popping open, it's also worth attaching one. 

If the only place your luggage is venerable is on the plane, and your zips can't pop open, I wouldn't worry about it. If security wants to get in, they'll cut off the padlock."
10702,They’re gonna open it regardless. Just don’t carry drugs
10703,No need for it IMO. Like inverse_squared already wrote if someone wants to get into your luggage he will anyway. Put your valuable stuff in your carry-on luggage and everything should be fine.
