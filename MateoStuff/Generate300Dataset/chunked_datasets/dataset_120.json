38185,"It would depend on what news you'd like. To get all views on a story, several newspapers would be useful.

The Guardian
Al-Jazeera
BBC
The Economist

Most newspapers will write the story to suit its readers"
38186,">The Guardian Al-Jazeera BBC The Economist  
  
Bam, listed exactly what I was about to put (minus the Economist, can't handle it).  
  
Al-Jazeera is incredibly good, but has a massive stigma attached to it. Someone asked me the other day ""Isn't that a muslim propaganda station?""  
  
On the other hand, the Times is sensationalist, etc etc, but is viewed as one of the best media organisations in the World. BAH."
38187,"Kind of agree with you. I just find the Economist is very easy to read, without being tabloid."
38188,"* If you are Socially Liberal: NY Times
* If you are Fiscally Conservative: WSJ
* If you need bite sized news: USA Today

Since I am both 1 and 2 I read both WSJ and NYT for different values."
38189,"WSJ, NYT, WaPo, Boston Globe (from MA im just gonna toss that one in there). They are all paying subscriptions. NOTE: these are all the cream of the crop on journalism here but are kind of out of touch and elitist. It’s not just right wingers who think that. Just keep that in mind as you read. I read these all the time cause nothing compares but they also have problems sometimes with corruption so it can be hard on some issues to get a fair view"
38190,"The big issue I have with those papers is the opinion section. It's really bad, and opinion pieces sometimes get more prominently placed than actual articles."
38191,"A lot of the established, “important” newspapers lean centrist and wealthy, and in feeling pressured to represent “both sides” in their opinion sections, publish some not great stuff"
38192,"They lean left, not centrist.

https://www.adfontesmedia.com/"
38193,"Have you seen the media bias charts that plot all the major newspapers and journals from left/liberal to right/conservative and from bottom/low quality to top/well-sourced? If not, Google ""media bias chart"". Then pick from ""skews liberal"", ""neutral"", and ""skews conservative"".

My top picks from each section:

Liberal - the New York Times and the Washington Post

Neutral - AP and Reuters

Conservative - Wall Street Journal and The Hill"
38194,"I’m partial to the Chicago Tribune, but that’s just because I’m from Illinois. Pretty much any major news paper will cover every national story."
38195,"I'd add the Christian Science Monitor to your reading list, as well. Don't be scared of the name, their reporting isn't heavily Christian or the like. They do a lot of really great journalism, including multiple Pulitzer awards (though nowhere close to the NYT's 170) and are highly reputable."
38196,"The Christian Science Monitor is required to do one article per issue on religion, but other than that it’s the same as any other newspaper. They have impressive content and are my favorite."
38197,"local papers, imo."
38198,"The Wall Street Journal if you are willing to spend the money for a subscription. The articles are pretty unbiased, but the opinion section is definitely conservative-leaning. I'm not a current subscriber because quite frankly I don't want to pay for it (there are other things I'd rather spend my money on right now), but I enjoyed reading it when I was."
38199,thank u dude!!
38200,"No problem! And just an FYI: if you're a student, they often have student discounts for reasonable prices. When I was subscribed it was through a student discount. I had print and digital access and it wasn't crazy expensive. I'm not sure what they're currently charging, though.

EDIT: if you're a student, you might want to check out the link below before paying for a subscription. Some universities offer all their students access to the WSJ website.

[WSJ Student](https://education.wsj.com/students/)"
38201,See not The NY Times or WaPo. Wall Street journal as mentioned is a fairly good source.
38202,"Wall Street Journal. Like the others have said, pretty unbiased compared to thr New York Times or Washington Post. Plus if you can get the student discount like I did, you can get it for $4 a month."
38203,"None of them. They're all impossibly biased garbage. That being said, the Associated Press can reliably be counted on to at least report on everything that happens, instead of only covering events that they can twist to make their chosen side look good. Their articles are still often riddled with bias, but it's far lesser than you'd get out of tabloids like the Washington Post or CNN."
38204,Shouldn't we be looking for accuracy rather than conformity to a particular perspective?
38205,"I suspect the intent of the OP was that center = politically neutral and unslanted in their coverage, which at least implies freedom from bias even if not complete accuracy.

Edit:  Nevermind, OP explicitly says in another post that neutral is not the intent.  My bad.  o_O"
38206,"I'd still say answering with this methodology is the closest interpretation you are going to get. I think the two generally come hand in hand. No slant will result in being in the center. Unless he wants a paper biased EQUALLY against both, which in the end is more a balancing act that real reporting/news."
38207,"I agree that is what we should look for. I'm not so educated in this area, so I wanted to get an understanding of the landscape of the print media in terms of where they stand."
38209,"Well said. I see you mentioned the Economist and the NY Times in a comment. Do you, personally, feel those are the ones worth naming because they accomplish this?"
38210,"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-0

That's The Economist's statement of their ideology, so to speak. It definitely has clear political opinions, but insofar as classical liberalism straddles both the standard left/right divide in the west, they are centered. You'll get a clearer picture from the linked article."
38211,"> For example, republicans follow Milton's economics, while democrats Keynesian, both have correct predictions, both have wrong predictions, it should only then present both views equally. 

This is not quite right. For example, both [Greg Mankiw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Mankiw#2008.E2.80.932009_Keynesian_resurgence) and  [Jason Furman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Mankiw#2008.E2.80.932009_Keynesian_resurgence) are [New Keynesians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics#Major_New_Keynesian_economists)."
38213,I don't think it's even true generally. Do you have a source?
38214,"The problem is, who decides what is credible and what is not? It's the watchman problem all over again. Ultimately, regarding most political issues, accuracy cannot be easily determined without research and thus a paper that balances its bias would be more likely to present a neutral viewpoint than one which just shows ""correct"" information, as I'm sure both Fox News and nbc believe what they are spouting is true and sourced."
38215,"Indeed. Beware the ""[Middle Ground](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground)"" logical fallacy."
38216,"The problem is there is *always* a perspective. What to cover, from where to focalize a story, who to interview about it, and so on are part of the message being broadcast. 

To make up a hypothetical situation, a national news outlet might run daily stories that center around malpractice by dentists. The story would be told from the point of view of the disgruntled patient. The patient and his or her family members would be interviewed. An editorial or an anchor might pose the question, ""is there a serious problem with our dental practices?"" All the coverage might be accurate, and since this particular news org covers a nation of hundreds of millions of people, they have no problem finding plentiful cases of dental malpractice: they exist, but might be statistically irrelevant. Doubtless, many viewers of this news program would come to be unreasonably suspicious and wary of dentists, despite 100% accurate coverage."
38217,"I think it's entirely possible to be accurate and biased.  A large part of political posturing is telling most of the facts in a way that makes your argument look good.  

A large contingent of voters in my very-liberal state turned on Public Option Healthcare when a running Republican accurately campaigned (and possibly blew out of proportion) that public healthcare could ""force a Christian doctor to provide abortions""... which is technically true for First Amendment reasons if that doctor worked at a public facility and an abortion was warranted for the situation.

You could say that was entirely accurate, but also rather biased the way it was portrayed.

I think unbiased low-accuracy information might be at least as reliable as biased high-accuracy information."
38218,"Probably not the answer OP is looking for but I really like www.circanews.com.  I find that the more sources, the better.

[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cir.ca&hl=en)"
38219,"Accuracy is not the issue. All newspapers are accurate (except the shitty local newspapers that don't even hire real journalists and just source all their important stories from AP). The editors' personal politics does bias any newspaper, not in the content of the information but in what is chosen to be included and excluded on any given newsday."
38220,"It's not a newspaper, but I read AP just about every morning. Stick to ""top news"", and avoid ""big story"", though. The content of their articles is comprehensive and fact-based, but the stories they choose to report is a little iffy sometimes; they're quick to jump on bandwagons (for example, they're so eager to crucify cops that it seems they report on every officer-involved homicide, and have even strayed into non-lethal shootings where the suspect was armed and threatening the officer).

I generally cross NYTimes (non-opinion articles) with AP and the usual googling to get a picture of stories unfolding."
38221,AP?
38222,Associated Press. Reuters is good too
38224,"Almost all of the major newspapers get their facts right almost all of the time. It's just that the NYTimes, WSJ and WaPo are all catering to different audiences, and tailor their coverage accordingly. 

NYTimes: General population with a degree from a 4-year college in the US, which is statistically slightly liberal, with a special focus on the NYC area, which is very liberal. 

WaPo: US-college educated population that is professionally involved in politics, especially federal government.

WSJ: US and international college educated businesspeople, especially finance and banking, which tends to skew conservative and corporate. 

For example, look at the story on the Obama administration's proposals for offshore drilling in the next 5 years.

In WaPo, it's ""[Obama administration opens up southern Atlantic coast to offshore drilling – but restricts it in Alaska](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/01/27/obama-administration-opens-up-southern-atlantic-coast-to-offshore-drilling-but-restricts-it-in-alaska/!)""
The article looks at both sides of the issue and the political opposition from left and right. Useful for people in Washington tracking the issue. 

The headline is similar in the NYTimes and the article includes detailed information on the areas being affected and the environmental impacts: [Obama’s Plan: Allow Drilling in Atlantic, but Limit It in Arctic](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/obama-plan-calls-for-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-the-atlantic.html)

In WSJ, the story is ""[Obama Administration Proposes New Offshore Drilling Rules](http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-proposes-new-offshore-drilling-rules-1428952622)""
The article looks at the impact on businesses and investors, but doesn't really care about the effects on the environment.

Same story, but dramatically different headlines and focus. That's why it's important to read multiple sources, especially on the topics that are important to you."
38225,"[Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/)?  Despite the name it has nothing to do with Christianity.  I also recommend nytimes and wapo, like the previous commenter."
38226,"I didn't know that about CSM.

For the equally oblivious: http://m.csmonitor.com/About/The-Monitor-difference"
38227,NY Times is nowhere near the center
38228,"Neither is the Wall Street Journal, but both provide quality unbiased reporting and keep their opinionated pieces in the opinion and editorial sections where they belong."
38229,"This is the most important thing, to me. I don't care if the paper has a position as long as it is both fair and accurate in its objective reporting."
38230,"The problem I find with this idea is that the left-right balance isn't just about *how* stories get reported; it's about *which* stories get reported, and which details get included. You don't have to lie or be opinionated to slant the news; you just have to have a slant in deciding what to tell in your truthful, unbiased manner."
38231,"This is very true, and I would never encourage someone to get their news from just one source. But an acknolwedged curation bias is, to me, less of a problem than bias in reporting, particularly an unacknowledged bias."
38232,Yeah but the quality of journalism in The Wall St Journal has declined since Murdoch bought it.
38233,"Agreed. The WSJ is still respectable by any means, but Murdoch's influence can be seen in the stories chosen and the perspective ""neutral"" article take. The best recent example of this are Net Neutrality pieces. Also when their Opinion section has article legitimately defending ""Intelligent Design""... it used to be much better."
38234,"NY Times is balanced outside of editorials? What are you smoking? Politics pervade everything in that paper, including the weather and music section."
38235,"NYT is a good paper, they're very competent, but like WaPo and like WSJ they tend to shove politics where they don't belong.  That said, each of these papers is basically slightly biased an in favor of a mostly moderate ideology."
38236,"Well, I agree with the previous commenter in that it's well worth reading even if you have a problem with its political bias.  It's just a quality newspaper -- there is a ton of great content that isn't subject to their bias."
38237,"Wapo?  Hell no.  I worked there, and teams would refer to themselves as ""we"" when referring to the democratic party.  Also, the conservative writers they have there are EXTREME.  I'm sure that was no accident to make sure they don't come off as competent.

I'm quite moderate myself, probably leaning towards libertarian."
38238,That's pretty much the only reason I think they haven't fired Jennifer Rubin or Marc Thiessen. They're pretty much just there to make conservatives look like insane douchebags.
38239,"Oh yes, that's another publication I saw mentioned. Is there much difference between the weekly and the daily versions?"
38240,"WaPo is good for staying connected politics wise, but then again they sporadically release incredibly biased pieces.  Politico is the same way, except they seem to go either way sometimes, whereas Wapo is consistently left.

As other people are saying, multiple sources is by far the best.  There are better options, but I generally will read wapo, politico, the times or Reuters, for a more balanced perspective, and then if theres an interesting or controversial story I'll try to find something about it on something egregious like Slate or Breitbart."
38241,"Came here to say that and the BBC.

Oh wait...

Ok, how about CSM and the Economist? Also the NYT as long as you realize they only cover what they feel is relevant from a leftist perspective, and their opinion pages are just worthless drivel, about on par with Fox News."
38242,"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-0

Political statement from The Economist. Quite reasonable. CSM is great."
38243,Excellent read.  Good find.
38244,The Christian Science Monitor is not very neutral
38245,"You are kinda out of luck if you are looking for a single good source. You need to piece together articles on specific topics to see the truth and examine the bias. Some have mentioned the Economist, but it is important to know they embody the very definition of liberal, meaning open up everything to everyone to make their own choices, essentially a more pragmatic libertarianism than we see in the States. If you are looking for straight facts and no analyses you can look at the Associated Press, very good for factual details but can be a little shallow on understanding and context. I like to use Feedly to pull articles from various sources and read articles on the same topic to get a better understanding of the subject. It aggregates everything together pretty nicely for comparative reading."
38246,"Agreed, the Economist doesn't slot neatly into either political persuasion in the U.S. and a lot of Americans perceive that as unbiased - they are a strongly pro-free market, pro-western, pro-Value Added news organization."
38247,"""There ain't nothing in the middle of the road except yellow lines and dead armadillos."" -Molly Ivins"
38248,"The definition of ""center"" [changes over time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realigning_election#Voter_realignment).  It's also subjective -- many people rate their own position as closer to the center than other people would rate them.  (see: /r/badpolitics charts)"
38250,It's worth pointing out that the Times' reputation for being a liberal publication is well deserved--from its edI trial board. Stay out of there and you should be in safe territory. I've been getting a lot of news from al jazeera America and I've been really impressed with their coverage and their topic selection
38252,OP asked for the most centrist and un-biased newspapers. I dont think editorials were something in mind here.
38253,*The Economist* by far. Any biases they have are often implicated or mentioned by the writers.
38254,"The Economist is insanely biased. You Americans would probably call it libertarian. In general, the Economist promotes deregulation of everything: from marriage to business.

It's still some of the most well written, thoroughly researched English-language journalism out there - but biased as hell."
38255,"For US politics, though, it's still a great 'centrist' source, as they have no dog in our fight, so to speak. And though its ideology is fairly as you describe, they tend to be wholly consistent about it, and have no issue taking any side to task for political nonsense.  Subtle difference between a 'bias' and a point of view."
38256,"""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""

*Politics*: the study of power relationships among members of a society.

*Economics*: the branch of knowledge concerned with the production, consumption, and transfer of wealth.


Just because *The Economist* is willing to occasionally lampoon ""the jackass or the elephant"" does not mean they do not have a bias. They do a really great job of pretending their economic assumptions and precepts are not also political."
38257,"[Economists tend to form their opinions based upon evidence](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/papers/views-among-economists.pdf). Politicians, not so much. As a result, Democrats and Republicans tend to [agree more with each other than with economists](http://college.holycross.edu/eej/Volume33/V33N1P81_94.pdf)."
38258,"Empirical evidence is very valuable.  However, to look at politics through a strictly evidence-based lens is to engage in [scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism).

The social sciences are difficult to quantify sometimes, and while that's unfortunate, we can't just ignore their non-quantifiable aspects."
38259,"Which is why Economics is not and will never be Psychohistory. But when talking on the large scale, the numbers are pretty damn useful, if not for predicting (as so many laymen expect of the discipline), most definitely for *understanding*."
38260,"If the goal is to read unbiased news sources, what better way than setting politics aside and looking instead at the evidence?"
38261,"For some things, it's impossible / very difficult to collect evidence.  (you can't do RCTs in the social sciences, for instance)

If you want to ignore those areas, suggesting that it's impossible to reason about them, that's scientism.  We *do* still have ways to reason about them, and ignoring an issue rarely helps.

The proper approach is to recognize that specific areas are [outside the remit of hard science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Defining_science), continue on as best we can with the tools that are available, and acknowledge that the conclusions won't be as rigorous as the hard sciences but we did the best we could."
38262,"The comment I was responding to stated:

> Just because The Economist is willing to occasionally lampoon ""the jackass or the elephant"" does not mean they do not have a bias. They do a really great job of pretending their economic assumptions and precepts are not also political.


The evidence I presented was that consensus in economics is based on evidence, not politics. 

Do you take issue with using evidence?"
38263,"> Do you take issue with using evidence?

No, you misunderstand.  Here's some reading material.

Logical positivism is dead:

> [Interviewed in the late 1970s, A J Ayer \[a major proponent of positivism\] supposed that ""the most important"" defect ""was that nearly all of it was false"".  ... John Passmore found logical positivism to be ""dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism)

**[Postpositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism)** is the currently accepted approach.  It doesn't reject positivism, but rather amends it to include the soft sciences / social sciences."
38264,"They and the entire profession of economics live under that delusion. The econ sub-reddit once tried to ban ""political"" content...yeah, try and figure out the logistics of that."
38265,"What on earth is your standard for ""biased as hell?"", the economist has good journalism, better than almost any other publication avaliable. If you think the economist is insanely biased what exactly do you read?"
38266,"As I wrote, I agree that The Economist offers some of the best journalism out there. Their [explanatory articles](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains), especially, are the most consistently well researched pieces of journalism you can find.

However, when it comes to politics and economics, The Economist is extremely focused on using deregulation to both explain the origin of and suggest solutions to the issues they cover. I hence used the word ""bias"" in the [1a sense of the Macmillan dictionary definition.](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/bias_1)

In the more traditional sense of the word, The Economist is often very one-sided in its reporting on contention. An example: I am currently writing my thesis on the recent secessionist movements in Catalonia and Scotland. After reading every piece the Economist have published about these topics since 2007, I have found that the Economist offers excellent analyses and compelling arguments and explanations. Namely that the secessionists are populists driven by greed, which is certainly true to some extent. However the Economist also unfailingly ignore other equally valid arguments and narratives. More specifically the secessionists are also driven by a widespread and partly justified disillusionment with their national governments after decades of neglect and marginalisation caused by their status as peripheral, minority regions.

The great thing about The Economist is that it's not just straight news reporting. The Economist offers explanations, analyses and even policy suggestions to the issues they cover. However, due limited space and a [relatively strict editorial stance](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ksbjm/i_am_a_correspondent_for_the_economist_covering/clocfu7) their reporting and analyses tends to be biased and one-sided; and must often be supplemented with other sources.

This can to a certain extent be said about most news. Just what a news source chooses to cover and how they frame it, can be said to constitute a bias. However, due to the admirable ambitions of The Economist, I'd argue that it is even more pronounced with them.

Also, as a non-american who is mostly interested in US federal politics, I don't think I should recommend news sources for Americans."
38267,"> Any biases they have are often implicated or mentioned by the writers.

... From what I have seen and have read, The Economist does a good job maintaining its neutrality. The Economist doesn't favor or disfavor regulation, it allows it writers to communicate their ideas on the topic. In so far as I have read, The Economist doesn't support either as an organization. Articles have been written by their staff that both favor and disfavor deregulation."
38268,"The Economist is the definition of mainstream economics, neoclassical + Keynesian macro. They are as biased as so far they follow modern economic thought"
38269,"Read the Right, read the Left, and read The Economist."
38270,it's a British magazine though
38271,"What's your point? The only thing British about the organization is the fact that they are based out of London. The Economist doesn't even remotely limit itself to British topics. It is a global company. They cover anything and everything that the magazine finds important. In fact, in their most recent magazine, their was little, if any, mention of Britain. The latest edition talked about artificial intelligence, financial technology (FinTech), war in Syria, Germany's influence and dominance in Europe, Danish politics, Italy's constitutional reform, global warming and its relation to our current weather experiences, internet firm acquisitions and dominance by major players, manufacturing in America, anti-bribery business, Indonesia's new president and their thoughts on how he will impact their economy and future, progress in behavioral economics, Saudi Arabia's stock market and its opening to foreign investment, international bond markets, banks thinning their retail branch networks around the world, the relationship between ageing and inflation in Japan's economy, America's Navy and their plans for electrically powered superguns, a bunch of science topics and research recognition, the evolution of music, the future of museums in America, myths surrounding American history and the founding fathers, book reviews, financial data... 

The company covers American topics more than it covers British topics."
38272,I'm just saying because OP asked about US newspapers
38273,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_editorial_stance
38274,"I love this part. My favorite part of the standard Economist article is when they say ""Of course, we believe in [free markets, freedom of speech, freedom of choice etc.] and so here's what the [President of US, UK, EU, Bolivia, etc.] should do.""

They're usually right."
38275,"[The Week](http://theweek.com/) magazine (not the website, which I'm not familiar with) has the least bias of anything I read. I don't necessarily think that makes it all that great; I'd give it up before I gave up the Economist."
38276,Definitely The Week because its just a digest and gives multiple perspectives of issues.
38277,"By some odd accident of history, the economist magazine has become the nearly exact embodiment of american conventional wisdom."
38278,"""Center"" in most cases just means a watered down version of what the left and right propose. Why would anyone  pursue this ""philosophy"" ? (it is more like the lack of one). The only reason someone should be a centrist is if they don't understand the other positions.

That being said, stop thinking that major, national news outlets are somehow more reliable or truthful than small independent outlets. The longer a news source has been around, the longer it has had a chance to be corrupted by the powers that be. The more popular they are, the more motivation to corrupt them. All the major US outlets release suspect information from time to time."
38279,"Your assumption seems to be that being ""in the center"" is somehow synonymous with ""balance"" or ""objectivity"". This is a doubtful proposition. The media in the US is comprised of major corporations, who sell audiences (readers, viewers) to other major corporations. This sort of arrangement pretty much guarantees that news stories and subsequent debate be limited to disagreements between corporate powers. What we see as ""Liberal"" and ""Conservative"", or ""Left-wing vs. Right-wing"" is really the spectrum of acceptable debate within that corporate media. Anything else is fringe or ""extremist""."
38280,Christian Science Monitor.
38281,"USA today is too short to have a strong bias, although you can see their bias in what they exclude. Honestly, I suggest reading both the NYT and Economist, none are center but they complement each other decently. Al Jazeera is decent as well. 

Everything is biased, the key isn't avoiding it, just to be aware of it."
38282,Very good point.
38283,"I read editorial pages almost exclusively, and *by far* the most balanced daily national is the *Washington Post*.  They strive for centrism and they pay for very good syndicated columnists on both sides -- not just ""token"" conservatives or liberals like at the NYT or WSJ.

Now, as it happens, I hold centrism (this is a non-neutral, personal opinion) in contempt, so I don't have very much respect for the WaPo editorial board. But they serve an essential role in their determination to ""ride the middle"", siding against extremists on both sides every time.  As an extremist, I can find this frustrating, but the value to the Republic as a whole is obvious.

Read the WaPo."
38284,"Roll call newspaper is what you're looking for, but unless you work on the hill you're gonna pay something like $600/year. 

Check out The Week magazine. You can get a free trial on Google Play."
38285,"A difficulty you'll face in your search is the balance of resources available for effective reporting vs. pure objectivity. 

The Week and The Christian Science Monitor are wonderful sources of objective news. However, they are small. Neither has the reporting budget to break big stories on their own. They also don't have access. Washington insiders won't call up The Christian Science Monitor to leak a story. They'll call one of the big three, the NYT, the WSJ, or WaPo. 

Those big three have armies of reporters they can throw at stories. They can break news, important news, with resources smaller outlets cannot match. They will have sources inside Capitol Hill or the White House or national campaign organizations which smaller papers only dream about. This size comes at a price, though. All three have a subscriber base which they will not cross. 

I'm not capable of characterizing the biases of the big three insightfully enough for NeutralPolitics. Every reader can be perfectly objective on some topics, but every reader also has their biases which they do not recognize. This isn't the place for an argument. I don't think I can characterize the big three without starting one. 

I suspect you came here for a shortcut to an objective source. The best I can offer is to read all five until you have a sense of where they are strong and where they are weak."
38286,"I'm always satisfied by the accuracy and up-to-date nature of Circa News, but it is fairly liberal leaning.
Edit: you know what, I take back what I said about its political leanings. It uses so many different sources that it really does cover all the bases. I think I just read the liberal subject stories more :)"
38287,"First, for a proper source, worry about whether they put their bias in front of the facts rather than just what that bias is. NPR is a pretty solid rag that does its darnedest to produce unbiased information, but it does lean left a little."
38288,"I am late to this thread and maybe this has been covered, but there is an important t distinction to be made in looking at political preference and newspapers, namely, editorial versus reporting.  The editorial page of a paper will always be slanted.  The news reporting shouldn't be, and the news editors of most major American papers do a good job of this.  

USA Today is the most middle of the road of all papers, but it's written on a fourth grade reading level in the print news edition, and that can only take you so far in limited space."
38289,"New York Times • Washington Post

Also, NPR, but that's radio."
38290,Economist??? That's right-wing as hell (economically-speaking; Idk about its positions on social issues).
38291,"The economist has excellent analysis of current issues. It may lean right, but when they dig into a story their coverage and analysis is solid, it's one of the best weekly publications still avaliable."
38292,"Read the WSJ, and NYT both have insanely good reporters and editorial staff, the ""truth"" is somewhere in the middle. 

What a lot of people miss is that the real bias exists in what stories you choose to cover, not how you cover them. WSJ tends to cover stories that push a more conservative view point, while the NYT does the same with a more liberal view point. The stories they choose to cover they cover well, but the bias exists in which stories they devote resources to. 

If you read both of those papers every day, you'll be about as close to having a balanced outlook as you can get. 

If you want to go to ""pro - level"" throw in the National Review, Economist, Forgien Policy, The Hill, and The Diplomat. They'll go more in depth with really good analysis."
38293,Can  we make a sticky? It seems this question gets asked every 3 days.
38297,"Unless every paper is the exact equal distance from the center to either the left or right, I would think that one of them has to be? I'm not asking for ""neutral"" but ""closest to center""."
38298,"New York Times is generally a good standard even though it leans left.  Washington Post as well.  You can find many center leaning papers, but I assume you're asking about the longstanding credible ones."
38300,Have you ever actually seen a Charlie Hedbo cartoon?
38302,They might as well print pictures out of Playboy or Hustler. Exceedingly unprofessional.
38306,"There's a difference between letting terrorists win,and printing something needlessly insensitive in your paper.

Look at it this way. Terrorists are also opposed to women showing their bodies in public. Does that mean the NYT is obligated to put a naked woman on their cover?"
38308,All the more reason to print it.
38309,And lose half their readers?
38310,"Seriously, they're incredibly insensitive."
38311,"Worse than that, the Hebdo cartoons are ham-fisted and lazy. You don't leave yourself much room for being clever, insightful, or astute when your humor doesn't rise above the level of the people you're pillorying."
38312,"I'm not trying to pick a fight or anything, I'm just genuinely curious about your statement.  If CH was *clever* about their islamophobia you would be more inclined to support a NYTimes reprinting?"
38313,"I neither support nor oppose the printing of his cartoons in any publication. Free speech is a nearly sacrosanct issue, as far as I'm concerned. And that means a publication reserves the right to publish them or not for reasons of their own choosing. 

My only observation is that the cartoons are not especially good. And, not being very good, I feel they haven't really offered any positive contribution to the discourse regarding the problem of radical Islam. In fact, I think they're strictly third-rate political cartoons that nobody would even give the time of day to if not for the horrific events that have elevated them to the global consciousness."
38314,"Really? I'm sure we could both cherry-pick articles to support our point of view, but I had the opposite impression. They're definitely not anti-war, at least."
38315,"I don't need to cherry pick articles, lean left is a generous description.  As to the medias take on foreign policy that generally has more to do with who is the commander-in-chief."
38316,"Not exactly a newspaper, but you can’t go wrong with The Economist."
38317,They consider themselves a newspaper.
38318,"It’s usually best to find outlets from the country you’re looking at. For India I generally read the Hindu, for UK Financial Times and the Independent are my go tos. Some countries don’t have great options though, so for China for example any mainland paper is gonna be state propaganda."
38319,Reuters
38320,"The Guardian if you avoid the opinion section like the plague. The UK politics live-blogs are great.

Second the Hindu for India.

The Atlantic, while not a newspaper, has pretty great international analysis."
38321,"To the extent that any media can be genuinely neutral, [the Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/) comes the closest, no contest. It's won ~8 Pulitzer Prizes for a reason! 

Other than that, I think understanding local media ecosystems is important (which papers are aligned with who, and so on). [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) can help for that. There isn't really a one-size-fits-all source out there that can handle every subject and region well, though.

But to be honest, I think that foreign policy think tanks tend to produce better coverage than newspapers. Newspapers want simplistic narratives that can be followed easily by readers and headlines that get clicks. :P"
38322,SCMP is still pretty decent for Asia news. The investment by Alibaba is concerning - and there has been a slight pro-mainland shift in the Hong Kong-related opeds since then - but the news content is still quite reputable
38323,France 24
38324,Your local paper(s)
38325,"Unfortunately my local paper has been gutted. Most staff writes for the online version now and delivery days have been cut in half.

I thought I mentioned that in my post, but I can edit it to make that more clear. Sorry about that"
38326,I mean it's still worth kicking for the digital subscription.
38327,Thanks for the advice. I really am only looking for paper publications though. I've tried digital and I end up reading maybe 10% or less of what is put out and prefer to read without an electronic device.
38328,"I wish it wasn't the case, for exactly the reason you gave because I want local papers to do well and local consumers seem to prefer print, but I don't see print coming back in any big way. What do you think these news services could do to better meet your needs? I don't have many ideas. I know kindles are recommended for their ""like paper"" quality, but other than that I'm kinda drawing blanks."
38329,"The reason I never read much in terms of digital is it gets lost in the shuffle. 

I get an email, I open it up click the link and start reading only to get another email and while I'm on a phone or computer, I tend to get distracted easily, whether by work or other. With physical mediums i can block all of it out.

Another issue is they send out too much stuff. If I get 3 emails a day each highlighting a different article, im going to stop clicking because i simply won't read most of them. It ends up becoming a chore of inbox management.

The sites are also usually horribly designed. I don't mind ads, but the ads on digital publications are the worst clickbait whereas with print they tend to be more thought out and relevant. They also massively get in the way. Massivr banner that takes up half the screen then every few paragraphs is an add that covers text, 2 or 3 pop ups. Stuff like that. I don't like using an ad blocker because I like to support the sites I use, but the ads on a lot of news sites, especially local are horrible."
38330,Well i can definitely relate to that. Wish I had more answers for you. I constantly struggle with what you're describing re: digital content overload and I still haven't really figured out a solution.
38331,"I'm slowly working towards a better balance. I'm moving soon and setting things up to where I can leave and basically go off grid for 2 or 3 weeks at a time to just revitalize myself. No computer or TV or other people. I'm probably 6 months from getting everything in order, which is fine since winter won't be a good time to learn."
38332,"Nice, sounds like a great way to have a more intentional life style in the modern era haha"
38333,"If you pay for a digital subscription, you'll get rid of all or most of the ads, so that's a non-issue. I subscribe to NYT and the number of ads seems much less than in my local print paper."
38334,"You're asking in some bad circles if you keep hearing ""none"" so I applaud you for asking around more. My picks:

\- NYT

\- WaPo

\- Local paper

\- The Economist

\- Financial Times"
38335,"I'd second this list, also add *Foreign Policy* to the list, as well as one or two foreign publications to your list, depending upon your interests and background. Which ones you want in particular is...up to you, and depends on your interests, other geographic regions of interest, etc."
38336,This is a great list I second this.
38337,"Thank you. Im seeing a theme of nyt and wapo. Ill have to pick one of each manually for a few days to see which I like better.

Economist is also something I had been considering.

Thank you!"
38338,"NYT is good for features, stories, and strong general coverage and data stories. WaPo is what to sub and read if you want Insider DC and coverage of politics, national stuff, and a decent coverage of other media companies (Margaret Sullivan)"
38339,"Ah, thank you. That was a very helpful answer!"
38340,"Every year I want to subscribe to the Economist and then I look at the price. 

Already subscribed to the first three - it’s tough"
38341,"I pay for NYT and WaPo. I'd pay for my local paper, but I work for it. I find myself wanting to access WSJ pretty often but have not yet started paying. I stopped paying for the New Yorker in college."
38342,"Do you find a lot of overlap in coverage between wapo and nyt? I'm definitely only subscribing to one newspaper, but am curious as to the reasons of having more than one. Maybe if I ever have more free time I'll change that"
38343,"As someone in the industry, I subscribe to both in part to support good work and in part because, when I google around for a story and find one on either website, I need to be able to read it.

In other words: They show up high in search results, and I want to be able to read those stories."
38344,"I like the New York Times and the Washington Post but my subscriptions are digital. 

Does your area only have one single newspaper? Is there another one you might consider supporting? Local journalism is where subscription dollars are best spent but unfortunately people who prefer paper are few and far between, so most resources are devoted to online formats."
38345,"Yeah, there's only one. I am moving soon and maybe my new house will have a good local paper, but that is one of the other reasons I'm avoiding the local paper is, I'm leaving soon. I will definitely grab one or more papers at a newsstand when I move to see how those are though."
38346,"Ah okay, that’s some good context to know. My advice stands then, when you move check out the locals! You likely won’t get willowy long form reporting like you will in a magazine, but being up-to-date on matters in your own backyard is crucial and any decent paper will at least do that"
38347,"I recommend three things:

1) Your local newspaper.
2) A national newspaper.
3) A preferred magazine."
38348,"Thank you. Hopefully my new city has a quality local paper. I'm definitely getting a national paper. And magazines I think have always been a favorite, even as a kid. So thank you!"
38349,"I think readers make their local papers better with their support. You can always write to reporters and on occasion letters for publication, and put your voice out there. My current combination of this formula, just to share, are Newsday, The New York Times and National Geographic. I do subscribe to The New Yorker too, but I may read more than many, I think."
38350,"Unfortunately I came to the realization of wanting paper news too late. My parents, divorced, canceled the paper after independently subscribing for many years. They transferred their best reporters to the company that focuses on online."
38351,"No love for magazines in these comments? It's the best thing to subscribe to in-print, IMO.

I subscribe to the New Yorker, the New Republic (great if you want a more left-wing perspective) and New York Magazine. Other good options are The Nation, Wired, Vanity Fair, GQ... lots more."
38352,"I'll 2nd New Yorker and New York Mag, both have really upped the ante, along with the Atlantic, in recent years."
38353,"Don't see a lot of tech mags in the thread, I'd agree Wired is the best of the bunch."
38354,"Thanks for the tips! I'd definitely like to ad a few magazines, especially since they tend to be monthly which allows me to read them slowly over a long time"
38355,"1. NYT - For variation and coverage;
2. STRATFOR - closest thing to CLASS you're gonna get outside a CLASS network. Not always reliable;
3. The Economist - No BS, just the facts;
4. Janes - Instant source of data on military affairs; and
5. Financial Review - Crystal Ball of future economic events."
38356,"What is a class network? I tried to Google it, but just came up with a bunch of unrelated stuff.

Jane's and financial review are both new ones. Is financial review the Australian publication? And if so, is it relevant for international news as well or does it mainly focus on Australian? 

Thank you for the suggestions!"
38357,"CLASS is the standard NATO term for 'Classified' ie - only available to people who have been vetted to see it. There are levels of classification from RESTRICTED - Government policy and such, to TOP SECRET POSITIVE CODEWORD which means that only a few people in the world have access to that information. This is real-life briefcase chained to your wrist stuff."
38358,"Well, its hard to say its not an interesting concept! Accurate or not, i could see myself enjoying the content. It does look digital only though, which is an issue for me unfortunately. Maybe I'll adapt to the times one day"
38359,"Digital is subject to SIGINT interception. A guy with a file in a briefcase attached to his wrist? The security guys arc up and you get a first-class welcome wherever you go. It's rare, it's unreal, but it happens."
38360,What is STRATFOR and CLASS?
38361,"[STRATFOR](https://www.stratfor.com/) is a private intelligence firm which employs former spooks to provide clients with general and bespoke intel on whatever topic they want.

CLASS is the standard NATO term for 'Classified' ie - only available to people who have been vetted to see it. There are levels of classification from RESTRICTED - Government policy and such, to TOP SECRET POSITIVE CODEWORD which means that only a few people in the world have access to that information. This is real-life briefcase chained to your wrist stuff."
38362,"I do love the Atlantic as well. I subscribe to the Atlantic, the NYT, my local paper, and one or two independent niche patreon newsletters and news sites."
38363,Thanks for the advice!
38364,"I pay for WaPo and the Chicago Tribune digital editions, I don’t necessarily read it too often, but often enough to be hit with a paywall when clicking on a Twitter link."
38366,"The Atlantic is my best bet, but High Country News is one of the best magazines in the country. It's all western news, but amazing journalism and a great community."
38367,"The Atlantic is amazing and the magazine that reminded me how much I value good journalism and reporting. You've probably read it, but just in case (and for anyone else), it was coming across this article that did it for me.

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/.

I'll have to check out high country news. I know very little about the western US, and live in Ohio so its one of those things that either could be eye opening or unrelated to me. Regardless, its worth checking out."
38368,"A lot of comments here are recommending big names like the New York Times and the Washington Post. I agree in part. The content they offer is certainly worth it, especially if you want a national or international perspective; but overemphasizing them as a primary place for news will notably ignore most of the issues local to you and [contribute to the trend that's pushing out smaller papers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/media/ben-smith-journalism-news-publishers-local.html). (They're also often notoriously long; they aren't kidding when they say it's ""all the news that's fit to print,"" and because of it, you'll likely miss a lot of their stories in the deluge they offer you, unless you spend a lot of time to work through everything.) As such, it might be good to try someplace else first, and see if that might fit you, before defaulting to the big names.

Given that, if you're unwilling to go with your local paper, I think other magazines like The Atlantic are your best shot due to being more tightly curated. These include your standard fare, like The New Yorker, Harper's, New York, The Economist, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Christian Science Monitor; but also magazines that cater to particular political perspectives, like The Nation, The New Republic, Mother Jones, Jacobin, and Reason; or magazines that focus on specific hobbies, like Scientific American, The Fader, Quanta, Wired, and Sports Illustrated. (That last one in particular might be of interest if you want sports stories.) 

(If you like The Atlantic because of their in-depth and expository storytelling, you might also enjoy looking [through this site](https://longform.org/), which essentially compiles high-quality long-form stories from basically any relevant publication. It's helped me find plenty of new sources that I find myself regularly returning to.)"
38369,"The New Yorker does some of the best-sourced longform investigatory journalism, and I really like their arts coverage, though that can be a matter of taste."
38370,Oddly enough I've never read the new Yorker. Ill have to check it out. Thanks!
38371,"The New Yorker, which I find gives an excellent, multifaceted representation of current US and international news, that's contextualised by in-depth, engaging pieces. There are many New Yorker pieces that I've read over the years that have stuck with me.

I also subscribe to a British publication called Private Eye. It basically casts a critical eye over the state of journalism and politics in the UK, and points out the hypocrisy across all British news publications equally, regardless of whether they're liberal or conservative. They also do some eye-opening investigative reporting."
38372,"I had never heard of that one. It might be interesting, thank you!"
38373,"If you love The Atlantic, you’re going to love the New Yorker."
38374,Your local NPR affiliate
38375,Do they do any print work?
38377,"Sorry, I'll clarify. I'm looking specifically for physical media only. I guess i assumed most people would understand print meant printed on paper or similar medium. Sorry about that, my bad!"
38378,"I’m a sports writer at a new sports publication, so I feel an obligation to support The Athletic.

Besides that, I subscribe to two local area newspapers, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal."
38379,"I'm not going to lie, I'm a broke college student. So I'll give you my list of publications that are free that I constantly read/listen to:

\- The Associated Press, Reuters (wire)

\- ProPublica, The Intercept, WhoWhatWhy (investigations & independent)

\- Democracy Now!

\- NPR

I'm into a lot of investigations, independent news, and wire services because I don't like partisan news. These independent news organizations usually are ""close to bias-free,"" because there isn't a political party that they're supporting. It's just straight reporting.

I was able to get a free subscription to the NYTimes as well because I'm a college student, so if you're a college student, look into that.

I also read my local newspaper, but like someone else said, I work for them, so I get it for free."
38380,"In print, I subscribe to the NYT Sunday edition, Wired, Mother Jones, Nat Geo and a local city magazine. All my other subs are online only. I wanna subscribe to The Atlantic, but it’s ridiculously expensive for print imo (and before you ask, the NYT sub was a gift lol). Used to subscribe to the NYer but all the writing started to sound the same after a while and I couldn’t keep up w reading an entire magazine every week. The stuff I read in print is more long form writing; online is more quick-hitter local and natl news."
38381,How did I forget about nat geo. I loved that as a kid! Thank you!
38382,"Of course!! Their photojournalism is world-class, and I love the poster maps they’ll send from time to time lol. Nat Geo Kids was the shit growing up and probably part of reason why I’m in journalism now tbh"
38383,I still read my school's newspaper physical copy.
38384,I got hooked on comics reading the Daily Texan.  (UT Austin)  Now all the comics I read are on the web.
38385,Man I loved the Daily Texan. I was also a huge fan of the Texas Travesty. It was always cracking me up in class.
38386,Haha. Last year I grabbed a DT every morning while walking to class... Small world.
38387,I grabbed the DT on my way to class and read it in class...
38388,"From a student reporter, thank you very much."
38389,I had an hour and 15 minutes between classes so i would read the school newspaper cover to cover and then the New York Times until I hit the business section. Uconn's paper was actually very well done. Well besides that one crazy bitch in the opinion section that made me face/palm twice a week.
38390,"There's only one editor that makes you facepalm weekly?  lol

But yeah, I agree that the paper's pretty good (for local issues) and the free *Times* issues are a sweet deal."
38391,I read my University's paper almost every day it comes out. I find it very informative and well made. I also love having something to read while I eat.
38392,"Yup, The Guardian."
38393,I get the Guardian on Saturdays because the magazine is nice
38394,And me!!! My saturdays are spent working my way through the Guardian and eating crisps. Either that or working.
38395,The Weekend Guardian in a sunny park with a couple of pear ciders is pure awesome. I always have to hunt out Charlie Brooker's column straight away too.
38396,"Same. Guardian and The Independent Mon-Sat, only the Observer on Sundays as the IoS is awful."
38397,"Regularly get the Guardian and Independent. There are a few reporters in other papers that I like, but I don't like the papers (eg Peter Oborne in the Mail on Saturday).
G2 in the Guardian is my current fave crossword too."
38398,"The Metro, Evening Standard, Daily Mail, Sun, or whatever other garbage is left behind by the last guy on the train.  I know I'll be reading the latest updates on Lady Gaga & Amy Winehouse whichever I choose..."
38399,"I would too, if it were sold in my country."
38400,comics whilst I shit.
38401,"upboat for using ""whilst"" and ""shit"" together."
38402,"The New York Times and Wall Street Journal every morning. The Economist, New Yorker, and New England Journal of Medicine weekly. I think I've associated information with tangible literature."
38403,"Wow, how do you manage the time? It takes quite a few hours to get through an Economist magazine for me..."
38404,He has a time machine.
38405,"I certainly don't read cover to cover. Just the lead stories, US, some Europe, and countries that are in the news as well as science and technology and whatever special they're doing."
38406,You're a better person than I will ever be
38407,I'm 16 and read the newspaper every morning. It smells good.
38408,I'm so glad there are other kids my age who read the newspaper.
38409,Why is reading a physical newspaper seen as so noble and pure? I'm lost here.
38410,"I think because reading a physical newspaper is supporting a dying industry. An industry that gained its strength during the foundation of a country and created a strong basis for our freedom. (edit: I should note here that I am from the States, and am only speaking about our own history of journalism.) A type of openness with which we were unfamiliar. 

Reddit has a lot of qualms about mass media, and I've seen some attacks on what newspapers stand for exactly in today's electronic world. While broadcast journalism certainly no longer represents what ""Journalism"" once was, I work at a local daily paper and can say we don't have time for that bullshit. We have a newsroom full of young journalists eager to report actual news as accurately as possible, working as hard as is needed to present the story to our readers. 

It's noble because everyone says, ""Why would I pay for something I can get online for free?"" But no one bothers to take into consideration that all those blogs - and even this site - link to the important stories that are often generated by print organizations. And with newspapers dying due to lack of support from a generation that thinks, ""If you can get it for free, why buy it,"" instead of, ""This is something I think I need to support more with more dedication so that it doesn't die, because what this industry does is important.""

Newspapers have been struggling with finding out how to adapt in today's market of electronic saturation, and they haven't yet found their sweet spot. Online advertising rates are too low but all the advertisers know they can get their product or message sen by much more accurate niche markets for a lot cheaper online these days, so it's a tough bargaining situation. 

Like all things, I think the bigger organizations will survive through the difficulties they face now and latch onto the next thing that will define how news is presented in copy form, but like anything where diversity is better, a monopoly will do no one any good and we'll just end up with more Fox vs. CNN vs. whothefuckever, completely biased sides with no voice of reason. Regardless of opinion or morality, newspaper ethics dictate the presentation of fact without sway. The good (and often locally focused) ones do this to the best of their ability. 

This is why I think reading newspapers is noble. Because I find a world without dedicated reporters scary. I think the passion of those interested in presenting this news is noble. And I think there is nobility in the readers who understand this plight and choose to support their news sources in the best way they can. 

Thanks for listening, and please forgive any grammatical errors, It's Sunday and I don't have a copy editor hanging around at my apartment."
38411,"I think devices like the kindle are the future of the newspaper industry.  I, for one, look forward to the day when we don't waste so much landfill space with newspapers.  Did you know that news is the single greatest filler of landfills?  Madness.  Check out Rubbish: The Archaeology of Garbage for a good analysis on that, amongst other topics.  But I digress.  I think the news is a noble pursuit and the kindle, as well as devices like the iPad, represent a desirable future.  I know I never paid for news before I had a kindle."
38412,"I understand your point, but I personally just think paper is a waste of resources. I've never fully understood why newspapers offer their content for free online. Now that they've done it, people just seem to expect it."
38413,Well I guess you can compare it sending physical mail. Since the internet took over so much you can pretty much read anything online. Reading a physical paper is out of the ordinary.
38414,"Seventeen, paying subscriber of The Denver Post."
38415,"Also sixteen here, read the local paper daily.  There's free daily papers on the morning city buses, and the University puts out a great monthly paper.  It's still shocking how many people our age are uniformed on the world around them."
38416,Uninformed*
38417,"That would make a lot more sense, thank you. :)"
38418,"There's nothing like the smell of weed, bacon, and newspaper in the morning."
38419,"Yea 17 here and i do the same. I used to just scroll through the sports section but now i read business, art, and world news."
38420,"I'm a reporter, and you just made my day."
38421,I subscribe to the Financial Times. I spend all day on the computer; it's nice to read something that isn't emitting light once in a while.
38422,"Yes. I find I read more stories when they're all laid out on paper in front of me. 

Also, I find with the newspaper, I read a lot of articles I wouldn't have read otherwise."
38423,"Yes! That is exactly how I feel. I have no idea why, but when the article is already in front of me, I am more likely to read it as opposed to when there is just a link."
38424,"I guess if you've paid for it, you're more likely to read it. I'm the same, reading probably 80 percent of articles.  If I'm reading the newspaper at a library, it drops down to about 30 percent."
38425,"Best I can figure is that it's a user interface issue. 

When I'm on a news site, my eyeballs tend to focus on the ""breaking news"" links and the ""Most Popular"" box in the sidebar"
38426,"I read the NY Times and my local newspaper on paper. I just like holding a physical copy of what I'm reading; reading online, I tend to get distracted and end up going to some other website. For the sake of actually reading legit news, I have to use an actual paper copy.

Also it makes me look old and wise."
38427,"New York Times Reader is a good purchase, pretty cheap and gives you the full newspaper every day (keeps the last 7 days, you can access archives on their site). I believe they also have a PDF version you can subscribe to that's even cheaper."
38428,I love the Times Reader. Doing the crossword on that is so much easier.
38429,"Newspaper still makes the best hamster cage liner. Though come to think of it, training a puppy to pee on a Kindle doesn't sound like a bad idea."
38430,I read the newspaper so I can cut out some of the letters to use for my ransom notes.
38431,Metro and Evening Standard. They're free.
38432,Montreal's Metro. They take most of their articles from the Associated Press and they (mostly) tell when they added their own stuff.
38433,"I read/skim the NYT every weekday. It's provided free here on campus. Plus I try to finish the crossword every day, but it usually ends up kicking my ass from Wednesday on :("
38434,What college do you go to?
38435,I know Cornell does this. I wish my school did.
38436,The Metro. Every day while on the train to school. (UK redditor).
38437,The Metro. Every day in the subway to work (Montreal redditor).
38438,"I read one every morning, and write some of it the day before."
38439,Which one do you write for?
38440,"New York Times Sunday Edition is the *shit.*

I always have to read at least the entirety of:

Main section, Week in Review, Book Review, and Arts and Leisure.

All other sections are on a ""meh"" basis."
38441,The week in review is amazing. I wish I could write the way Frank Rich writes.
38442,i like a bathroom reading material that can be discarded after use.
38443,or in case of emergency...
38444,i work for a local paper in the pressroom and in prepress...i read the fucker everyday
38445,"(High five). My paper used to print on site, but we now print 40 miles away. Bothers me to no end."
38446,(down low) yea that shit sucks! we do ALOT of commercial work for outside papers and other local thingers. but we have a nice little 6 unit press can run 24 pg color 24 page black...tis nice
38447,(to the side) I start work at a paper tomorrow. Wut
38448,(fist bump) where at?? woot woot
38449,"I always read a physical paper when I ride the bus or sit around in a coffee shop or waiting in a doctor's office or whatever. At home or work I always read the Internets.

Here in Vancouver there are a lot of free papers that you can get on the bus or in coffee shops. I think it's a shame because in these rare moments where people are receptive to reading something outside of their normal sphere it is wasted on reading low quality free papers littered with ads.

A while ago I thought it would be cool if you could easily take good blog content from the Internet, turn it into a paper and then distribute these papers around your neighbourhood or school. It would be a great way to spread alternative media and messages to people when they are receptive to reading them.

Shameless plug: I made a website that lets you do that: [www.zinepal.com](http://www.zinepal.com)

The idea never really took off and I am now selling Pro memberships on the site and positioning it more as an eBook creator. You can still use it for free in a more limited way and all new users get a free Pro account for the first month. If you try it out please send any feedback my way."
38450,"Did... did you just have an idea AND implement it on the web before hitting submit???

I call shenanigans. ;-)"
38451,"i read the new scientist every week, and whatever is floating around on the train."
38452,"I used to read the Washington Post on a regular basis when I was home from school, but they changed the typeface and layout in order to seem ""more relevant"" to us digital kiddies. It's difficult to explain how disconcerting it is when a newspaper you've been reading for 20 years suddenly looks like something else entirely."
38453,"Newspaper rocks! 
Everyone's too modern and stuck up to say that these days."

38455,I can print out my kindle?
38456,"I go to Cornell, and they provide the Daily Sun (school paper), New York Times, and USA Today for free.  I usually read the Daily Sun and the NYT, and do the crossword/sudoku when I have time.

Best part of it all?  The NYT Dining section!  Man, I love Wednesdays just because of the dining section.  It has the latest food ""trends"", food porn, great recipes, snarky restaurant reviews, sneers about hipsters, and angry letters from hippies who don't want people eating rabbit."
38457,"Your comment has convinced me to start reading the Dining section. I mean, food porn, sneers about hipsters, AND angry letters from hippies? What else could I ask for?"
38458,Is there anything left to ask for at this point ?
38459,The Dining section has reviews of restaurants in Ithaca? Or does it just make you wish you were in NYC? ;)
38460,"In my city/town the print newspaper is actually a lot easier to read than the online version. It's always nice to spend a morning with coffee and a physical newspaper. 

Also see: slippers, robe, eggs, toast."
38461,"I'm required to read the Week in Review from the New York Times every weekend for my AP Lit class. I hated it at first but I realized making it a requirement (to read and annotate) opened me up to new ideas to explore. My teacher may look like voldemort, but whatevs. It's all good."
38462,I subscribe to the Wed and Sun Oklahoman. You do find interesting local articles (from things to do to offbeat news) that I don't think I'd find otherwise.
38463,Paper newspapers are good if you want to find out about local things.
38464,"Me, but I'm 52 yrs old and need the physical copy to justify my news."
38465,"I get the Independent every Saturday and Sunday, and any weekday that I will have the time to read it (rare). I like the cryptic crossword, and there's also something soothing about reading the paper over a lazy weekend breakfast that the Internet and TV news just don't have.

I get the local newspaper once a week as well, but mainly for the job listings.

Edit: choice of paper is solely because it's the only well written UK paper I have come across that doesn't force political opinion down your throat. In terms of reporting style and content, I used to prefer the Telegraph, but don't like the bias in political reporting. I still sometimes cave and get the Sunday Telegraph, their crossword is far more challenging!"
38466,Did a search for cryptic and upvoted. It's the reason I buy then Indepenent.
38467,"I do. I wake up and there's three of them lying around me. What do you expect me to do? Can't disappoint them, can I?"
38468,"They work nicely as kindling, but not-so-nicely as toilet paper."
38469,"I read the local daily most days. And when I'm in another city, I pick up the daily (or dailies) there. There's just no digital substitution to holding that thing in hand."
38470,"The only time I read a physhical newspaper is when I read the free commuter news paper [Metro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_International), otherwise I check out the news online."
38471,"Yup. Everyday. Maui News before I moved, now Japan Times."
38472,So we can laugh at you!
38473,"As a private investigator, a physical newspaper is part of my uniform.  I get the national post.  But I also read the globe and mail and toronto star on my iphone.  Canadian papers."
38474,"I used to read one everyday, but reddits taken over that time.  I might spend thirty readings it at work.  Honestly nothings changed."
38475,Almost everyday. Even though I've grown up with the internet I could never give up the newspaper.
38476,"One of my favorite things to do is to plop myself down at the counter at my favorite diner, order a cup of coffee, a bowl of fruit, and maybe an egg sandwich, and just nibble, sip from the constantly refilled cup of coffee, and read the local paper for 2-4 hours.  It costs about $10, including tip, fills me up with caffeine and good food, and is very informative and relaxing."
38477,"I read the Dallas Morning New every morning.

Pretty much the same reason as you do."
38478,I get a free newspaper every morning and read it on the bus/train to school.
38479,Only chumps that's who!
38480,"I pick up the SF Chronicle nearly every day, mainly for the crosswords, as they keep me sane and busy on the bus."
38481,Because no one would read the SF Chron for the reporting! :-)
38482,i do the crossword in the paper on break at work.
38483,"I used to read the newspaper everyday when we got a subscription.

My question to my fellow redditors is, what is your technique on picking out what to read?
I sat down one day waiting for a friend and read the whole NY Times daily edition from first article to last (Minus the classifieds and court notices etc.) and it took a whole 3 hours! I don't know how people can actually read the entire newspaper of that caliber in one sitting. Granted some newspapers are smaller then others, but the NY Times is found everywhere in the 50 states."
38484,"I usually start with the NY Times on the front page. If none of the stories interest me (this rarely happens) then I just skip to the back for the Op-Ed (my favorite section). After that, I go to Arts and Leisure, then back to International and National news. Every once and awhile I will read the business. On Sundays, nothing beats the Week in Review with Frank Rich's column. His piece today about Rand and the Tea Party is a good read."
38485,Local paper not online.
38486,"I read all of my news online except for Washington City Paper, which I read while I'm out eating lunch on weekends."
38487,"I will read the dreadful, yet free Metro if I'm commuting into London, and I may read the Observer if I've got a long journey on a Sunday, but that apart paying for the privilege of reading news I've already consumed the night before doesn't appeal to me"
38488,"I try and buy a different paper each day - the subsidised rates at my Student Union make it possible. Normally I focus on the broadsheets - The Times, the Telegraph, the Guardian and the FT from time to time, but more and more the Independent. I only read tabloids if they're the only thing available, mostly because so much of it is just unbearable tripe.

I also subscribe to The Economist, and cherish my weekly copy."
38489,"Canadian here with two physical newspaper subscriptions, a daily one to the Globe and Mail that I'm thankful for each morning, and a weekend subscription to the Toronto Star that I'm considering axing. Used to actually buy the Toronto SUN nearly every day until they (a) put most of their paper free online and then (b) took most of the content I enjoyed out of the physical copy."
38490,"My son because I can't get him into the habit of reading the comics online. My colleagues where I work because the hotel insists on leaving a small stack of them outside my door in the morning, I gave up protesting about them about a year ago....."
38491,"I read The Economist. I had a subscription since 7th grade, but my parents cancelled it when I went to college. I could get copies there, but now that I'm home I don't know what to do. Also the New York Times is free at my school, and again now that I'm home, my meals are lonely."
38492,"I still like to buy the Sunday paper, or a USA Today when at the airport.

It still is nice to have the feel of the paper and ink in your hands."
38493,Yes I do! New York Times and New York Magazine.
38494,I read all of them
38495,"Ocasionally I read the Bangladesh Daily Star in paper form, but usually online."
38496,"i use to but i just go online now, i do play the sudoku in the TheSpec though"
38497,"I just resubscribed to the Financial Times last week, as I missed reading a paper in the morning. I also get The Week (not technically a newspaper) and I buy the Economist once a month (there is a little too much there to get through in a single week with everything else).

The fact that a broadsheet newspaper is so east to scan lots of stories fast, I read more quickly than I do online."
38498,"I pick up the Onion weekly, does that count?"
38499,Every day. [The 8th most circulated newspaper in the world. Japanese seem to read a lot of newspaper!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_World_by_circulation)
38500,I always try to grab a NY Times every day at school and at least skim it. I was away from campus last semester and I definitely missed it. Even though I could access it all online I usually don't go out of my way to do that.
