Fuck yes. I love the Ace Combat games on PS2. It pisses me off to no end that the latest one moved from the fictional universe of Strangereal to the real world. The new plot couldn't have been more generic. I actually haven't played it yet (waiting til I can find it for like ten bucks) but I've been reading up on it. It's just another Call of Duty ""Russian separatists have taken over the government"" plot and I hate it because the old AC games had amazing storylines. Ace Combat 4's plotline was awesome, what with Yellow Squadron and such. 5's story was great as well, and Zero's replayability can't be beaten.

I've been thinking recently about unpacking my old PS2 and playing the old AC games because I loved them so much."

Seriously?"
29497,"First of all it's my opinion, so fuck off in that regard. Secondly, I have a legitimate explanation;

Edit: Fuck. You're going to have to take my word for it, but I wrote a 3-paragraph in-depth explanation on my phone, and only the first two sentences posted. I'll do my best to give a brief summary of what it was;

When I first got BK: NaB I had no previous experience whatsoever with any Banjo Kazooie game. In fact, I had never even heard of Banjo Kazooie beforehand. I saw it in the discount aisle at my local toystore, and asked my mom to buy it because I felt like trying something different.

When I first got home and played it, I was blown away. The graphics were beautiful and well stylized, and had enormous amounts of detail in all the right places, but not too much otherwise. The orchestrated music was unique and interesting, and fit each individual area very well. The tongue-in-cheek humor just topped it off for me.

But what I loved most was the core gameplay; engineering. I loved architecture, design and engineering as a kid, and still do now (currently working on a software engineering degree), so I was immediately hooked. The challenges were both interesting and varied, as well as difficult enough to present a proper challenge. Outide of them, I would spend hours just designing machines that barely qualified as vehicles most of the time, because it was so much fun. I never even ended up playing the original two games once I found out about them, because they just didn't appeal to me as much.

**TL;DR I picked it up with an unbiased view and loved it because it's main mechanic drew me in.**"
29498,Well explain.  Because that is Banjo and Kazooie: Butchered and Milked edition.
29499,Explanation edited in; check my post again.
29500,"Well, thanks for the response.  I can see how it hooked you as a kid.  But just some friendly advice, you should really go back and play those two games.

If you play them I think you'll understand the collective ""wtf is this shit"" expressed by everyone when Nuts and Bolts came out."
29501,"No, I've since played them. And the sudden change in mechanics and theme between the second and third games is certainly an understandable shock, especially while the fans were waiting and were promised a good, legitimate sequel for so many years.

But little old me, who picked it up without any of this hatred or pretense, decided that it was a good game by itself. In fact, I can probably guess at how the developers felt while developing it, ""This is so well polished, and such a nice departure from the usual shit! People will love it, and we can guarantee sales with this classic IP as well."" They may have lost track of the original idea through extended development, and underestimated the backlash they would receive, but It's a great game nonetheless, and I'm glad they published it as they did. Besides, collection platformers weren't in the popular spotlight at the time, and it wouldn't have done especially well anyway."
29502,"Wouldn't have done especially well on xbox*

And yeah, my little brother got it when it came out and I just couldn't believe my eyes.  It is hard to think of it as a stand-alone game, but hey, maybe it is decent.  Still can't believe you chose that over everything else though lol. But it's w/e, I guess I'm just still mad that Xbox has the rights to B+K, preventing a proper sequel and their inclusion into Smash."

29505,"1. Far Cry 3 (xbox 360)- I was never into FPS until this game. I played some but never got into any campaigns. This one had me hooked instantly. The most fun I've had with any single game.

2. Uncharted 2 Among Thieves (ps3)- Excellent story and smooth controls. Difficulty gradually increases at a nice pace. 

3. Mike Tyson's Punch Out (NES)- One of two video games I've ever played with my dad. Our whole family loves boxing. Not so much a boxing game as it is a strategy one, but still insanely addicting. Presents a huge challenge. This game put hair on my balls at age 6. 

4. Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past (Super NES)- The original was way ahead of its time and this game showed it was no one hit wonder. Updated sound and graphics while returning to the original overhead gameplay enhanced the experience while keeping the charm of the original.

29510,"As someone who has relied on PC gaming almost exclusively for the past several years, I find this list immensely helpful.  I hope folks here appreciate this excellent list for pointing out great games we may have missed, rather than as an attack on our glorious principles..."
29511,Thanks brother! Glad I was able to help :)
29512,Being part of the PC Master Race does not mean you hate games solely because they are console exclusives. It means you hate the fact that a money starving developer has decided to put into place artificial restrictions so as to allow a good game to be released exclusively on an inferior piece of hardware.
29513,"Indeed restrictions are BS. though they can sometimes be limitations of a development cycle (does not excuse AAA titles).

Now that prices are more reasonable the restrictions are becoming less annoying (though still annoying), and I hope people who've wanted to play these games take advantage of that fact.

Edit: Realized you're not only a mod, but the creator of PCMR (It helps to read sidebars eh?), and I was kinda worried this thread would be deleted - which would suck - as even I personally intend to use this list in the future.  Thank you for making me feel better :O"
29514,"You forgot the Kingdom Hearts series, which IMO was one of the best games on the PS2. It's a mix of Square Enix and Disney, which sounds weird at first but I'm telling you, they did it sooo well.

Here's a list of the games and their respective consoles, in the chronological order (will also number the order the games came out):

6th) KH: Birth by Sleep - PSP

1st) Kingdom Hearts -PS2

2nd) KH: Chain of Memories - Original on the Gameboy, and 3D remake on the PS2

5th) KH: 358/2 Days - DS (runs concurrently with CoM)

3rd) Kingdom Hearts 2: - PS2

4th) KH: Coded - Originally a spinoff for a certain mobile phone. It was remade for the DS.

7th) KH3D: Dream Drop Distance - 3DS

8th) Kingdom Hearts 3 - PS4/XBOne (coming soon)


There are to HD remasters for the PS3:

KH HD ReMix 1.5 - Includes KH1, Chain of Memories, and 358/2 Days

KH HD ReMix 2.5 - Includes KH2, Birth by Sleep, and Coded



If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend you play the PS3 version. But, it's pretty playable on the PCSX2 emulator (I played it there and it works phenomenal!)"

29519,"I really liked Midnight Club 3: DuB Edition.  But I've been avoiding racing games as its one of the few racing games I've actually played.  I'll add it with more support, but someone else mention motorstorm too so it's looking like a possible addition shortly.

Edit: Also another reason I avoided racing games is that I tend to see that most racing game enthusiasts lean towards pc gaming.  Though this is not always true and I could have my perception all screwed up."
29520,"Forza and Gran Turismo definitely deserve the nod, but I'm not too experienced with the other titles there."
29521,The people who made the motorstorm series also made Driverclub if you don't know that.
29522,I had no idea.  I've heard mixed things about Drive Club so far though.
29523,"The game got bad publicity because of the costant delays, their failure to keep up to date with the release date and the lock at 30fps

It's good game with a lot of promises, I prefer off road racing though like WRC games and Motorstorm games, but Driveclub is awesome too if you want graphics like Need for Speed The Run"

29536,"I noticed this issue too, but if you open full comments instead of the little button it won't open all those links and lag."
29537,"So, games that were better on console?
Dark Souls, The keyboard controls are unchangable and bad, 'end' is the pause/back key.
The game is locked at 30 fps and 720p by default, requires a mod to change
The game has awful multiplayer because GFWL works as well as a tampon made from crayons"
29538,"You can use a controller with your PC so I think that's a bit of a moot point.  The game was also locked to 720p/30fps on console, so again, that doesn't really mean the console version is ""better"" (if anything, the pc version was better since you had the ability to remove those limitations with a mod).  GFWL was pretty much the only real downside of Dark Souls on PC.  Everything else was basically equal.  That said, Dark Souls is actually [abandoning GFWL and moving completely over to steam](http://steamcommunity.com/games/211420/announcements/detail/202985743519497275), so soon you won't even have to worry about GFWL."
29539,Praise Jesus.
29541,"Praise GabeN indeed.

First we have to ship...Portal 2....and then we have to ship...Dota 2."
29542,[Praise Him!](http://gabenislife.com)
29543,"> The game was also locked to 720p/30fps on console

Technically it was 1024x720 and stretched horizontally, and 30fps became 15fps in Blight Town and other busy areas."
29544,"Vanilla experience was better on console, but mods did fix the issues.  I guess if you don't want to monkey with mods it'd be better, but I still think those mods made the PC experience better personally."
29546,"Good point. I initially hadn't considered it since Dark Soul's came out later in the franchise it and is available for PC, but I think Demon Souls is also deserving of a place and is popular enough to be put on the list."
29547,"Yeah agreed, 60 fps Ds is wonderful.. But multiplayer is still broke ... Although it is going steam next month"
29548,"I really like Halo, but I am not going to buy a console to play it |:"
29549,"Understandable.  Though, I will say an Xbox 360 can be bought on eBay for as low as $60 these days, and since a lot of people are going to want to transition to Xbox One since the costs were brought down to $349, an influx of sellers are BOUND to come in soon, and perhaps we can get consoles at even lower prices if were lucky because of it!"
29550,"Halo's all I was on 360, I played the shit out of all of them. I've been faithful to pc for 3 years now, but still miss halo 3 and Reach more than any other game on console. So either, i'm going to have to wait until the very unlikely event of MCC coming to pc, or dig up a potato and enjoy some good ol' lan/splitscreen with my mates."
29551,[why not both?](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/759/both.png)
29553,HELL YEAH! Let's hope microsoft doesn't shut em down though!
29554,"They're all volunteers, making everything from scratch, and following microsoft's ""terms and conditions"" (Something like that) to the letter. Which means they can't sell it either; Halo Pc for everyone! Although, i really wish they were allowed to receive donations."
29555,Lollipop chainsaw for the xbox360 amazing
29556,"I really considered adding it to the list, but I'm really on the border due to reviews >.<"
29557,"Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders is my favorite Xbox exclusive as well, I was thinking of purchasing an Xbox simply for that one game."
29558,I have this thought once in awhile.  God damn that game is good.  It felt like a perfect blend of Dynasty Warriors and RTS with a badass world and badass music.
29559,Fuck yeah. Anyone that doesn't think Red Dead Redemption is worth buying or borrowing a console for is a goddamn commie.
29560,"Mind if I add a few games to that list that no-one has mentioned yet?

Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice (PS3)

Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten (PS4)

Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (360) (Yes. This game is a great game as it is even if it doesn't fit in the franchise.)"
29561,"I havent played the Disgaea series and to be frank in the past the word has put me off since I have no idea idea what the fuck thats supposed to mean.  But I will definitely look into it now and watch some gameplay vids and look at some reviews.

I really want to add banjo kazooie: nuts and bolts.  Problem is, most people hate that game for what it did to the franchise (myself included).
So while on its own its a decent game I just can't bring myself to put it on the list.  Poor Banjo :("
29562,"Let's just say Disgaea is a grid-based strategy RPG that is competely OTT in almost every aspect. It can be both challenging and hilarious. Just look at the trailer for Disgaea 4 (Which imo is the most entertaining trailer I've ever seen.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soH8jG_gfGQ (Skip to ~1min in for the main part of the trailer. the first minute is somewhat of a piss-take on most RPG trailers.)

As for N&B, Nostalgia and the franchise don't affect me as I've never owned an N64. Yet I really like the mechanics and non-serious nature of N&B. I can see why BK fans would be upset though as Microsoft did kind of force a completely different game into the main franchise of it and not a spinoff."
29563,"Nice list, though it's missing [Catherine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_\(video_game\)).

Despite its cover, the game's actually really good. It has an interesting and somewhat dark-ish story, some really fun and challenging puzzles and overall it's a very unique experience. While probably not fit for your average Call of Duty-fanboy, I often end up recommending it to peasants in my vicinity.

You have to enjoy puzzles though, and learn to think with boxes."
29564,"interesting, I'll have to watch some gameplay videos and look at reviews.

Edit:  Wow. I'm adding this to the list."
29565,"Move Steel Battalion off of the Xbox 360 list!  It's for the original, not the 360.

There was a Steel Battalion title on the 360, but it was a Kinect game whose entire premise fell on invoking [Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan) on the other guys in your tank.  Over and over and over with shoddy controls and putting the mech controls on, well, a controller.

You also can't play the original on the 360 because the 40 button, 3 stick, 3 pedal controller is required to play, but is not recognized by the 360 as a control device if somehow modded to plug into the 360.

Edit: and actually, no, not all xbox games work with the 360; [just barely over half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360)"
29566,">You also can't play the original on the 360 because the 40 button, 3 stick, 3 pedal controller is required to play, but is not recognized by the 360 as a control device.

Point made. This will be the one game that gets its own category.

Also, screw the ""sequel"""
29567,I bought an xbone strictly for the forza series
29568,"> forza

This is what I would do if I had money."
29569,"""Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom""

The PC version of this game is *COMPLETELY* different from the console versions. The Gamecube version was a solid platformer, and the PC version is a mediocre adventure game."
29570,"Forza Motorsport 4 should be up there. It's the only reason I still have my 360. It isn't the most realistic racing game, but it's easy to learn and very fun. Oh, and the game looks really good for something that's only on 360. Lots of cars and upgrade parts, and Jeremy Clarkson's in it. Can't beat that."
29571,"Not to mention you can use Fanatec's wheel, pedals, and shifter.  It also has one of the best modeled clutches in any racing sim.  It was also pretty and had a good framerate.  FM4 was impressive."
29572,"There are tons of great console exclusive games and no member of the Master Race should be ashamed in playing them. The real tragedy is that these games are held back by not being on PC. 

Imagine Bayonetta on PC on Ulta. Oh man..."
29573,Eternal Darkness
29574,Red Dead Redemption still not on PC... (cries in pillow)
29575,It makes me sad that they passed us up with this title.
29576,shadow of the colossus. fuck mannnn.
29577,"Get gears of war judgement off this list, it's a disgrace to the series. It's not worth anyone's time."
29578,My gf and I played Time Splitters 2 on her PS2 last night. Albeit I remember the third one being better. Simpsons Hit and Run is actually pretty good on PC.
29579,">Simpsons Hit and Run is actually pretty good on PC.

Thanks for bringing that to my attention! I wasn't aware it was also available on PC.  However it looks like a copy is around $30 but there might be cheaper copies available on ebay.  It's really up to the consumer if it's worth it :)

Ninja Edit: You also could be right about TimeSplitters 3 being superior.  I didn't get a chance to play that one, and I think I may have mixed those two games up in terms of critical acclaim.  I will be sure to add that to the list!"
29580,"I'd say hit and run isn't all that great on PC, the built in controller support is wonky and has issues with newer controllers, along with weird compatibility issues with new version of windows, overall I just found it was easier to emulate.

but good call on battle on bikini bottom, it's actually a very solid platformer/actiony game, and it's faithful to the source material (i was a big fan as a kid, and my younger cousins like it, so i'm still pretty familiar.)

edit: oh god i forgot about the PC version of battle for bikini bottom. but whats the issue with deadpool (besides it not being a very good game)?"
29581,"Deadpool was removed from Steam, can't remember the exact reason but I believe it was a shift of the rights of Deadpool, perhaps due to Disney buying out Marvel?

>I'd say hit and run isn't all that great on PC, the built in controller support is wonky and has issues with newer controllers, along with weird compatibility issues with new version of windows

Good to know, I'll keep it as recommended for console then, though it will be made aware its available on PC."
29582,Hey! Deadpool was fairly fun.
29583,"Timesplitters 3 is probably the best FPS I've ever played. It has hilariously bad voice acting, an over-the-top plot, humor that's all over the fucking place, and a slew of stereotypical characters; including and not limited to: Teenaged girl in a horror movie, the bad guy, Austin Powers with a moustache, the Sexy Assassin lady, roided-up Bender, all topped off with the main character: meathead space marine, who looks suspiciously like Vin Diesel. [This video sums up the entire game perfectly, just in one scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7JoYffgFYQ). Trigger warning: 240p, and spoilers."
29584,"ps2 has some good games i played in my childhood, like megaman x collection (x1-x6), megaman x8, gundam dynasty 2 and budokai tenkaichi series"
29585,"I began playing video games on a PS2 when I was a young kid, despite now being an exclusive member of the PCMR (though I do use Dolphin, and PS2 and PSX emulators).

My favorite games were Kingdom Hearts, Sly Cooper series, Crash Bandicoot series, Jak and Daxter series, Spyro series, and the Ratchet and Clank series.

I also owned Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, which I loved so much and I would always play that with friends when I could invite them over *reminisces*. 

You also seem to forget Shadow of the Colossus, which I'm sure many people would say is an amazing PlayStation game.

Upvoted you because you not only reminded me of my childhood, but because I can relive amazing gaming moments with emulators.

Praise you, brother.

EDIT: Silent Hill 2 if I recall correctly is EXTREMELY difficult to find for PC. I'm not sure about Silent Hill 3, because I have only bothered with 2 (Heard Silent Hill 2 is the best of the series).

EDIT 2:
You actually do have Shadow of the Colossus, albeit the HD remake on PS3."
29586,">You also seem to forget Shadow of the Colossus

I have it in the list as the remastered collection along with ICO.  But I appreciate that you are being thorough!

Silent Hill 2 Is indeed impossible to find for PC.  Not only that, it is extremely expensive if you do find it.  Silent Hill 3 has a far more reasonable price of about $25 on PC."
29587,"I feel like the Army of Two series (or at least the second one in the series; 40th Day) should be on here.

Some of the finest co-op gameplay you can find with fun shooting mechanics and customization."
29588,I completely agree. I've played two Army of Two games and they are great.  Adding them to the list!!
29589,"Ok that time spliters vid audio went perfect with the second half of Adrian Hour - Lost In Groove (Original Club Mix), I might turn that into a remix later just for the sake of it."
29590,"If i could have any game ported to the pc no questions asked, it would be The Last of Us. The best game i've ever played."
29591,I would port red dead redemption.
29592,What about The Last Of Us?
29593,It's on the list.
29594,Dont forget Ace Combat Infinity! Its Free To play and has a horrible business model but its a good game besides that.
29595,"King Kong is also available on PC, I bought it back when it came out."
29596,"Really? Now I have to check prices and availability on the game.  BRB thanks.

Looks like a viable and preferable option!  Thanks for letting me know!"
29597,"I think it came out at the same time as the console version. I bought it right when the movie came out, and I thought it was a pretty good game, without any port-issues."
29598,"No love for Bayonetta? I was a fan of God of War 1 and 2 but after playing Bayonetta a couldn't get into GoW3, it was so boring in comparison.

Got back from my honeymoon yesterdat to find Bayonetta 2 special edition waiting for me, if it wasn't for the damn jet lag (and reddit) I'd have started it already!"
29599,"I REALLY wanted to add Bayonetta, the only reason I chose not to add bayonetta is because the original game is included with Bayonetta 2 on Wii U.

But as a cheaper option, it might make sense to add it to the list.  I want to so bad...I think I have to."
29600,"Well, you have to buy the Special Edition to get B1 but yeah. 

Have you played God Hand? I fucking loved that game too! It's on PSN although I've no idea how much it costs, I bought it the day it was put on there after having a not so legit copy on my PS2."
29601,"I have not played God Hand, but it looks fun :)"
29602,"Flower? B:TS?  
*slowly backs out through the door*"
29603,"I do have flower on the list, Beyond two souls is also on the list if that's what B:TS means :P

Edit: I'm really tired.  Did you mean that you disagree with those titles on the list?  I think that's a valid complaint if that's the case.  Flower was a simple game but a good one, and it helped keep the company afloat that would later make Journey.  Someone else also had a problem with B:TS, and if I continue to get negative feedback towards its addition I'll remove it.  The narrative and actor cameo really made me want to put it on the list.  But there are likely games that do it better."
29604,"While I've always loved PC gaming more than console I can't help but feeling left out since we don't have many fighting titles. 

Things are better than before with Mortal Kombat/Injustice being as good, if not better than the console versions (and Street Fighter thrown into the mix) but not having Tekken is a major bummer :(

Also a personal preferance is no WWE games. I stopped watching WWE some 10 odd years ago but the game is a totally different thing altogether and a guilty pleasure I would have loved to see on the PC."
29605,"WWE games are pretty darn fun.  Even though it's really outdated, WCW vs. NWO: World Tour is still my favorite wrestling game thanks to nostalgia.  But all the games are pretty darn fun.  It's not a first round pick for the list, but since its not available on PC I'd say its worth considering with more support.

Edit:  And the main problem of adding a wrestling game...WHICH ONE DO WE PICK?  feels like another iterative franchise that keeps getting better."
29606,Yeah. Though for it's a first round pick because I can't get that sort of experience at all on the PC. There are similar games to God of War on the PC. There are better FPS games. there are just as many platformers as there are on the consoles. WWE is the only game that doesn't have a real replacement on the PC.
29607,You've proven to me that a wrestling game has to be picked. What are your favorite wrestling games?
29608,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown_vs._Raw_2008

That's the only one I played for any extended amount of time. I skipped the entire PS2/PS3 generations wrt consoles (saw no point as PES was ported to PC and it was the main reason I needed a console).

Played it at a friends mostly, so I never got really in depth with the game, but would have loved to see it on PC."

29610,"Thanks for your input!  Kinda gonna be a dick and shoot ya down though sorry ;_;

I've played your particular game and I did like it, and even though I'm not choosing this game it's not because I don't think it's good enough or anything like that.

However, I'm going to choose Smackdown! Here comes the Pain for PS2.  I'm choosing it because it's definitely the wrestling game I've played the most in PS2/PS3 generations, and it also has the highest metacritic score and user score out of all the wrestling games on PS2/PS3."
29611,"No probs, as I said, it's the only one I had any real experience with... so if the one you're putting in is better, by all means put it in :)"
29612,thank you for dealing with me :P
29613,Don't forget dragons dogma for the ps3.
29614,"This thread. I like it.

I'd suggest the Crash Bandicoot series. Immensely fun platformers and a racing game, back when Naughty Dog made games and not movies."
29615,I do love me some Crash.  I never really got around to playing the crash series beyond PSX though.  I'm sure the series could use some love on the list!
29616,"Don't worry, the franchise went to shit after Crash Team Racing."
29617,"Halo CE and 2 are on PC. I found them to be pretty decent ports, they are quite easy to get a hold of and their controls are good as well."
29618,"Good point, I have no idea how I forgot this.  I'd like to keep Halo I on there just for anniversary edition though.  But I will definitely add halo CE and halo 2 to the pc lists and recommend them."
29619,"Upvoted for compiling such great list! Glorious!

Growing up, I spend lots of my time on my PS, PS2, Xbox360 and PS3. Well not anymore due to the Glorious GabeN decided to cut the price of most of the PC game. 

Circlejerk aside, I played some of those games you've listed and it was awesome. Appreciate your effort for compiling."
29620,Really? No Yakuza 3 and 4?
29621,"I never had a chance to play this series, and didn't think about it.  I'll do some research and watch some gameplay videos.  If more people vouch for the series I will definitely add the game to the list.

Edit: It looks like it has some favorable reviews. and the game play looks pretty fun.  There's a good chance I'll add it to the list."
29622,"Scratch Gears of War 1 from that list, i got that one on pc and it is still one of my favorite games."
29623,You are right! so many games on the list I keep missing little things like this.
29624,Timesplitters. What an incredible fucking series.
29625,"Not many of those appeal to me. Fable 2 was a great game (love Fable!!!), and I first played Kotor on Xbox. When I found out it was on PC, I made the switch and haven't looked back since :D"
29626,"You should add the Ratchet & Clank series to PS2, I can't really speak about 1 and 2, but I loved 3 and Gladiator."
29627,"I have the remastered ratchet and clank collection in the PS3 list that includes all of the Ratchet and Clank PS2 games, but thank you for double checking as I've made a number of mistakes since I posted this."
29628,Respect to this post.
29629,Socom 1 & 2 were my favorite games ever.  Nice list.
29630,I'd never played SOCOM 4 on PS3 and wanted to look into it to add to the list.  I was so disappointed to find out it couldn't hold up to the earlier SOCOM titles :/ Those were some great games.
29631,"Ya I actually stopped gaming for long time after my socom 1 and 2 addiction.  never played 3 or 4.

FYI there is a mod for cs:go that puts you in 3rd person view.  Someone remade frostfire, crossroads, and desert glory.  It's worth checking out.

unfinished maps are the ruins and the mixer.

He's releasing more too."
29632,I hadn't realized Deadpool was removed from Steam. Any particular reason?
29633,Skate needs to come to the PC that would be amazing :O
29634,"God damn does it ever.  It's stupid that the developers didn't put it on PC because not only is it a great game, it would have virtually NO competition as a skating game."
29635,"The mods man, the mods."
29636,"I've been a huge fan of the Armored Core series up to (before) Armored Core 4.  All of these games were on the PS2 except for the first 3 being on the PS1, one PSP exclusive, and two ports to PSP.

Armored Core 4 and above are on 360 and PS3 if I recall correctly."
29637,"You can play Halo 1 & 2 on pc, list is null and void"
29638,"If you read the list further down you'd see that was made clear, and that those versions of the games were labelled as the preferable versions.  However I chose to keep them in that list because of the anniversary edition.  I'll take away Halo 2, and rename Halo 1 to anniversary.  I hope this is sufficient."
29639,"Hmm.  I never really liked the PC port of Halo 2 because its modding support was really more like ""modding support"" if you know what I mean.

Compare/contrast to Halo Custom Edition, one of the most moddable games around."
29640,"I'm still sorta torn, being my first console was an xbox, and Halo 1 was pretty god damn good. So if you MUST play console games, Halo 1 and Halo 1 anniversary are must haves. If you did make it clear that they are also on pc, leave them in :D"
29641,An unusual example: The Quake 3: Arena port to Dreamcast is considered one of the best ports of its time for being so exact that it allowed online play with PC players.  It also supported keyboard and mouse.
29642,"SOCOM is so good. I have 1&2 on PSP. Also, Simpsons: Hit and Run is like GTA."
29643,"I've been watching some people play Sunset Overdrive and that looks like a ton of fun, the style makes me kind of nostalgic.

Out of all the games there are on consoles, the only 3 titles that have ever made me want a console were Lollipop Chainsaw, The Last Of Us, and now Sunset Overdrive."
29644,Thank you OP this is a nice post. It's good to see some of my favourite childhood games on here. =D
29645,"As much as I want to say ""you can play all those HD remakes on an emulator"", I have to say Final Mixes introduced a non-trivial amount of improvement to Kingdome Hearts and since I can't read Japanese, I can stand buying the HD ReMIX"
29646,Basically any game on current gen is great.
29647,"What about the PS1/Gamecube/NES/SNES/etc. and other titles? 

And i think you missed some fighting games like dead or alive, soul calibur and tekken."
29648,Isn't Spiderman 2 available for PC as well?
29649,Is it really? I'll look it up
29650,+Sunset Overdrive ^^:(
29651,No 8th generation games in this list
29652,"Journey.


What a fantastic game. I sooo wish it was on the PC. It sent shivers up my spine and teared up my eyes when after about 5 playthroughs I realised the story being told. Haunting familiar."
29653,"Ace Combat Zero, 4 and 5 were missed."
29654,"So as I mentioned earlier, the amount of original Xbox games supported on the 360 is [roughly a little over half, several with issues but vastly playable, and requires an emulation profile to be downloaded or otherwise loaded onto an HDD before the game can be played](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360).  The statistic is at the top of the article, which also lists all titles with support as well as their issues."
29655,Ah yes I forgot about this issue. Does anyone know if the games on the list currently falll under this issue?
29656,"Well Microsoft said waaay back in 2007 that no new games would be added to the list.  So the list has been final for a long time now.  If it's not on the list, it'll never be supported.

The page was last modified a few days ago and is well-cited so I'd say it's current and reliable."
29657,"It is worth noting that the PS2 version of Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 is almost completely different from the Gamecube, Xbox, and PC versions because the latter was made by one studio while the former was made by EA Black Box.  It looks much, much prettier and is overall more fun, but runs at a lower framerate.  Sound familiar?  Recommend checking it out if you've played the others.

Also, the Xbox version has bloom whereas the PC version does not."
29658,"NOBY NOBY BOY for the PS3 is by the creators of Katamari Damacy.  It involves BOY eating everything to make GIRL grow, or something like that.  It will destroy your mind."
29659,"I would also like to add that, if you are a JRPG fan, the PS3 is key for that genre."
29660,"Where's Wipeout? :( Wipeout Fusion and SSX 3 had to be my top PS2 games. Fusion looks fantatsic on pcsx2. 

WipeoutHD for the PS3 was excellent too. Where are the space racers for pc."
29661,i think gears judgment should be taken off. i hated that game and halo wars should maybe be added
29662,"there are some sport games series that are only available on consoles like MADDEN, NHL and MMA, and probably only games that would be on this list for their next-gen versions, these  are titles that truly run 1080/60"
29663,I'm a bit dissapointed there's no nintendo system games there but some of those games I enjoyed playing before I ascended
29664,"Read ""Notice!"" For my reason in passing up Nintendo titles. I love me some Nintendo."
29665,Mechassault was a very god mech game. I suggest we add it to the list
29666,"While those games are fun, I felt they bastardized Battletech."
29667,"Have to say, I watched my sister play the last of us and after the opening sequence I was crying like a little girl, that game needs a PC release just so everyone can experience it."
29668,What about Jak and Daxter on PS2? :(
29669,On the list in ps3 section as remastered collection
29670,Oh sorry didnt notice it. Was looking in the PS2 section. My bad.
29671,"Great post!

Can I make a couple more recommendations for the PS2 list?:

Ace Combat 04, 5, and Zero. Great flight shooter games through and through. Extra love for AC04. Of note, Vector Thrust on Steam Early Access is created in the spirit of these games.

Persona 3 FES and Persona 4. JRPG's released for the PS2 that offer compelling characters and stories. Related to Catherine in the PS3/Xbox 360 list, as they come from the same developer and have some in-universe crossover."
29672,"I've decided to add Persona 4 to the list, thanks for your feedback :)

Not sure if I can bring myself to include a flight game from a console though, even if it is good. But I'll think about it and look into the game."
29673,One series: Monster Hunter
29674,"For a Rhythm game, I´d throw in Project Diva f und f 2nd for the PS3 into the ring.

Yes, its insanely japanese (its basically guitar hero on Hatsune Miku and many many drugs), but a fun music game to pass the time and pretty much exclusive on the PS3/Vita.

EDIT: Also the near entire range of japanese RPG´s. You do not get many of them on the PC (just dropping the Tales of series, recent exclusives are Vesperia for 360 and Graces f, Xillia and Xillia 2 for the PS3)"
29675,"Ninja Gaiden II; it may not have the polish of Ninja Gaiden Black (neither did the original, hence the Hurricane Packs/Black), but it's still a stupidly fun, bloody, and challenging action game.

Also, Mobile Suit Gundam: EXTREME Vs. and its sequels.  They're some of the most over-the-top fun you'll ever import.  Hell, I'd be happy just for Bamco to localize Maxi Boost at the point."
29676,Sweet list my friend :)
29677,What about the DOA series. From what I have heard they are actually pretty great fighting games. Minus the er... *plot*. Also I now you can't list all of them but JRPGs in general. Those are well worth the money of a ps3/ps4 if your into them.
29678,"man i sure do miss the hell out of gears of war, i remember playing that shit for hours"
29679,"Okami is perfectly playable on PC. besides that, I have no objection to make."
29680,"Thanks for putting FFXII on that list, playing with an emulator at 1080p is a dream."
29681,Also Star Wars: Battlefront! That was great :D
29682,Tharlts on pc
29683,"[PS2] : Persona 3, Persona 3 FES, Persona 4 ( i know Persona 4 Golden is flat out way better but still...)"
29684,This was a great idea. Good job mate
29685,"Happy to see Lost Odyssey up there, I loved that game. Wish they would make a sequel."
29686,Bayonetta is on Ps3 and wiiU
29687,"For all the shit it gets (deservingly so) Destiny still isn't that bad. It's not worth $60, and if the combat isn't your cup of tea, feel free to pass up on it. But I like the combat enough to where despite the insane grind, I still like the game. I do recommend it."
29688,"The Yakuza games need to be on there, IMO.  I love that shit."
29689,"Looks ok so far. I'd take off a few PS3 games. Don't really need Heavy Rain, LBP1, Resistance 1&2, and you really don't need the Silent Hill Collection or Army of Two."
29690,"Maybe you want to put Shadow of the Colossus on this list. It is Playstation 2/3 exclusive, i've never played it, but i heard it is pretty great."
29691,"I personally think Asura's Wrath deserves a spot. I watched an entire playthrough years ago and I've wanted to play it since. Combat's pretty fun, and its storyline is pretty neat too. Good cinematics, epic boss fights, all around great."
29692,+1 for enter the matrix specifically... I'd give more up votes if I could for the plethora of other games on this list that are fantastic
29693,Skate 3 is easily one of the best games I've played. I wish it was for PC.
29694,"I like 2 better, but regardless it was a great series."
29695,"I'd love to play 2 more but it runs horribly on my PS3, generally leading to freezing/crashes. Could be a bad disk, idk. 

Skate 2 always has that fisheye effect, or 'camera man mode' on Skate 3. I've noticed that on Skate 3 I get way better FPS with Camera man mode off than on, so that could be part of it. 

I really like the map in Skate 2, though."
29696,.hack games for PS2 is nice. Also the Tomb Raider games are on Steam and pretty good (the original series)
29697,If you prefer controller use and the game doesnt support it use [Pinnacle game profiler](http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/download)
29698,Put Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2 on PS2. Great RPG games.
29699,I agree. I'll being adding Dark Cloud 2 to the list.
29700,"Without getting into the major franchises, I have a few gems for PS2:

* [Dropship: United Peace Force](http://www.ign.com/games/dropship-united-peace-force/ps2-14437)
* [R.A.D - Robot Alchemic Drive](www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJW2WiY_ULk)
* [Maximo: Ghosts to Glory](www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1pLnIkXdM)
* [Maximo vs Army of Zen](www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAVTuWV9xqY)

I think Nippon Ichi had a good run on PS2 with titles such as: 

* [Makai Kingdom](http://www.ign.com/games/makai-kingdom-chronicles-of-the-sacred-tome/ps2-714345)
* [Disgaea: Hour of Darkness](www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_GfpyEKYGQ)
* [Phantom Brave](http://www.ign.com/games/phantom-brave/ps2-617701)
* [Soul Nomad and the World Eaters](www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGPGRTMGsI)"

29704,"The Genesis was amazing. The games all had a certain, unique feel to them. Plus, the game's OSTs on the system all had this badass techno/electronic/Retrowave sound to them.

I love it."
29705,"Out of curiosity how did the Xbox make it into your top 5? It's not because I think it's bad, I own one still and love it. It's just very different from the rest of your list."
29706,"It's not so different from Dreamcast. It had a fair number of Dreamcast ports and sequels. I guess so did GameCube and PS2, but the Xbox ones stand out more to me. 

I really loved Xbox. In a way Microsoft was a lot like Sega back then, willing to try different things to stand out from the mainstream. They were the underdog challenging the establishment, and that led to a lot of games coming to it that didn't arrive elsewhere. Xbox was also the most powerful of its era, with also contributed to a lot of exclusive.

Xbox also has my favorite controller ever (the DUKE). That shit was perfect. 

It was really difficult for me to pick only five. There are a lot of others that are pretty close in there for me. The order was hard to pick too. Maybe if asked a different day I'd give different answers. But at the moment I answered this, these five are what came to mind. 

32X, PS2, GameCube, 360, Game Boy Micro, Vectrex, ColecoVision, Odyssey, LaserActive, Channel F, Astrocade, Microvision, and 3DO are all pretty high up there for me as well."

29719,"Hmm. I have only properly experienced Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox, Wii, 2DS, GBC, PS3, PS2 and Philips Videopac G7000. G7000 wasn't great by any means (early computers like C64 beat it in every aspect), I only keep a PS2 around for a single Star Trek game and I have sold Wii, 2DS and PS3 away because they didn't fill my needs. That leaves four, but even so wouldn't really feel like a proper answer to the question at hand.

Instead I'll list top five features I respect the most in a console. I understand you may have to take actions, but please leave me breathing.

**1. Background music** - Honestly an obvious Xbox thing, but nonetheless a priceless casual feature.

**2. Rapid loading times** - We're rapidly losing this... to the barricades!

**3. Low noise** - For some reason I have had a PS3 spin a game disc *ultra fast* while I was watching Youtube. WHY?

**4. Serviceability** - I like to open my stuff up and maintain them thoroughly. This too is getting harder and harder.

**5. Brand** - Not all companies are equal, sadly. Sony: hacks. Microsoft: We remove more features than we add new ones. Nintendo: Whatever, you fight to get hold of one anyway.


I didn't include mundanes like exclusives or graphics because those are just too obvious. The only reason you get a console is to play games, thereby you get the console that runs the games you want to play."
29720,"www.ynab.com

Best comprehensive budget app there is"
29721,"I'm going to second ynab, a lot of budgeting apps will be monthly and based around salary+monthly expenses. ynab is different in that you put in income, and then assign it to the budget, making a lot more flexible for when paychecks have different amounts, but still letting you track where money is going and plan it out really well."
29722,"YNAB has changed my life in so many ways I don't even know what I'd do without it.

My only gripe is that it's now a subscription service. I still have Classic version and they'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands."
29723,"Hows that work?  I bought YNAB on Steam years ago, do we get grandfathered in or something?"
29724,I upgraded to the subscription service a few months ago but based on what I understand you'll be able to continue using YNAB4 perpetually; you just won't receive any updates (security or feature).
29725,"I feel I should add, the new subscription based of YNAB is well worth the price if you ask me. Plus, if you already had YNAB4 you get a lifetime 10% discount. If you are a student, you get a free year of YNAB."
29726,"Also YNAB can now pull from bank and cc accounts.  That's probably a big integration/maintenance undertaking which might have contributed to the pricing model change. It goes against the old philosophy of YNAB (which is a huge deal IMO) but after using both it honestly just makes maintaining my budget a lot easier.  

I don't get as far behind on getting transactions into the tool and it doesn't take long to sort everything out even if I'm pulling in 50 cc transactions.  That said, a downside is that there's less time spent on the reckoning and fallout from poor decisions (consider this if painstakingly entering your bad decisions is an important deterrent).

I think I'd recommend standalone YNAB for a new person who wants to really understand budgeting and I'd recommend YNAB online for someone who already understands and agrees with the YNAB system (or someone who is admittedly too lazy to enter transactions individually)."
