32871,May I ask why you edit in Google Docs? Isn't it inconvenient to switch back and forth between them?
32872,"A few reasons.

1) As already mentioned, I like having different grammar algorithms

2) The different font / design layout freshens the work to my eyes - like how people suggest you print it out or read it aloud or just change font. Sometimes just changing something like that will help you experience your writing in a fresh way and catch mistakes you missed before.

3) I find Docs' commenting easier than Word's, and when the whole point is to comment on what needs work, that's a big plus

Switching back and forth isn't hard at all. I open my Word document with the whole story in it (I save individual scenes first, then compile them into chapters, and then put them into a single document for the whole story), hit Cntl+A to highlight all, then just copy paste into a new Doc. The only hard thing about it is compiling the chapters into a single document and then later breaking them back down into chapter documents, but that's just 10 minutes of copy paste work. Not hard at all."
32873,"Dude I use Grammarly free version and it's perfecto. Try it, my friend."
32874,"Tried it out just now. Does it crash your MS Word while quitting the application?

If I enable it, use it, then disable it, quit MS Word - this crashes Word."
32875,"Huh, never had that problem, works just fine for me. I'm using it currently."
32876,Grammarly premium is extremely good but expensive. I can provide premium accounts for a much cheaper price if anyone is interested.
32877,"None at all. Learn from reading, not from letting the computer tell you what's right or wrong.

That said, I did code a styleguide standards-checker for Word, but that's for professional use..."
32878,"One of my main and unconventional tricks is to run stuff through text to speech and listen to it.  You need to become accustomed to the way the voice sounds but you can hear all sorts of errors that you'll read right over and some that grammar checkers don't often find.  

In short, the human ear.  It's fine tuned by decades of listening for what sounds right."
32879,"As Obi Wan once said to Luke Skywalker: ""Just rawdog it bro"". If it feels right then I'm going to assume that it's either grammatically correct, so close to right that nobody except a 19th century schoolmaster is going to notice, or an acceptable stylistic departure."
32880,"I am my own grammar checker. I'm very good at it. I have studied Reed Kellog Diagrams and Sentence Trees, and am pretty damn good at constructing them and using them to analyze complex sentences if need be. I also have a copy of a style manual and a copy of Bryon's *Modern American Usage* for when I need to look something up. For spelling, I type the word into google and let it correct me, then look at the definition to see if it corrected me correctly.

If you are at all good at grammar, there is no need to pay anyone anything. You just need to use due diligence and stay focused when editing your piece."
32881,"None.

If your dialog is at all realistic, they will do nothing but flag things you want exactly as they are."
32882,"You can ignore their suggestions you dislike while still using it to check the rest of your document for mistakes. It's not an ""all or nothing"" deal."
32883,My all time favourite energy drink is gonna have to be the original Monster. But I do like other energy drinks as well
32884,"Ugh, so many to choose from. I find myself always gravitating towards the low carb monster. But lately I've really liked the warheads and sour patch kids Ghost drinks."
32885,"3D Energy has been amazing. Smooth light carbonation, great flavor, and 200 mg of caffeine, as opposed to 300 from Bang. The red 3D is the best punch flavor in existence."
32886,"Ngl probably G-FUEL, lots of different flavours and a decent value for money. I like Red Bull and a few Monsters, but if G-FUEL was able to just be bought in shops here or without horrendous shipping I'd buy it way more."
32887,I was excited to see Gfuel in my Hy-Vee I bought the Pewdiepie one out of excitement
32888,I have that one! What do you think of it?
32889,"I liked it, it was pretty good for my first Gfuel"

32917,"•NOS Grape
- Although having same amount of caffeine as reg. 16FL OZ monster(~165mg), dosnt make me shake.[like drinking grape smarties]

•NOS original 
- Taste nothing to write home about(citrusy)

•Moster Rehab tea lemonade(Not Strawberry Lemonade)
- Solid taste, uncarbonated (if you dont like carbonation)

•Bang Star Blast
- I cant say anything anything on taste because its somthing you gotta try for yourself, and that theres no aftertaste.

•Bang Purple Haze
- good grape flavor not as good as the NOS Grape

•Bang Blue Razz purple haze
- Good taste, No real aftertaste

•Original Monster 
- Tried and true monster not much to say about this one other than personal preference.

•Cafinated Seltzer Sater(any brand)
- When all I need is caffine and dont care about flavor.

•Full Throtle
- Initial taste is ok, aftertaste is kinda meh.

•Red bull 
- The one we all know (for the most part).

•Red bull Watermelon 
- Good start, bad aftertaste"
32918,Also drink some water with it
32919,underrated comment. energy drinks will only do so much especially once a tolerance has formed (hint: unless you haven't had any in a week or more you have a tolerance) but water does amazing things for your alertness ..think the water in the energy drink is enough? think again
32920,I just meant that would make it easier on your body
32921,"From someone who was actively traveling and playing videogames competitively I can tell you. I tried everything ranging from your standard Monster to online ordered extra caffeine pills(Much like Adderol). The best for pure mindset and focus, is always NOS. Standard blue is the best, but theyre all fine. I honestly dont get the focus with others. A monster or Bang gets me hype, but im just jittery and energetic im not pushing out that quality gameplay. While drinking NOS, I legit feel like I have the next few hours of pure concentration to win. Give it a try."
32922,"Old post but here 

Game fuel (mtn dew) 

• sounds retarded but it helped my awareness , I drank one all summer when playing in skirmishes etc. awareness and focus went up and that also makes accuracy go up if your focused and in the zone. 

Bang 

• 300mg of caffeine makes u go crazy so yeah , you’ll be cracked lmfao. 


G fuel 

• I’ve never really had g fuel like that but I’ve heard it works , I mean it’s meant for gaming. Game fuel would be your next bet since it’s easier to get.


Also drink water with it !!! Whatever drink u decided to take DRINK A BOTTLE OF WATER WITH IT. I promise u this helps a lot."
32923,"Bang Energy. 300mg of caffeine, Co Q10 to help you focus, and only 80mg of sodium. Reign almost similar but has 200mg of sodium so I’d stay away from that unless you’re working out"
32924,"I recommend Focus Aid or Red Bull. Bang's BCAAs aren't for cognition and CoQ10 is in too small amounts to do any good so really it's just Bang's caffeine there to help with focus. However it would be metabolically better to have a steady stream of caffeine from multiple Red Bulls as opposed to one large dose caffeine of Bang.
The other drink, Focus Aid, seems a bit harder to find but it contains caffeine *as well as* other ingredients to help you focus: Vitamin C helps make neurotransmitters, which send messages to nerve cells. A deficiency in Vitamin D increases risk of cognitive decline (meaning IDK if it'll help you in one night but maybe a long term thing).
#important : Choline is your BFF here.
Alpha GPC gets metabolized into the active form of choline...More good news for your neurotransmitters."
32925,"most energy drinks are good for this, however I would recommend XS as it uses vitamin b12 as it's main ingredient which helps with mood and focus.

If you want to know more I go into more detail in my [blog](https://energydrinkreviews.siterubix.com/xs-brand-of-energy-drinks/)."
32926,Thanks for all the replyes
32927,"I’m a novice but I’ve been loving rockstar tmgs. Cheap, zero calories, and one of best tasting energy drinks I’ve had"

32933,Yeah was going to say the same one. Love that it's not carbonated and has a lovely taste. Gutted that it's pretty impossible to get in the uk now.
32934,"Monster M100 Phantom. It was literally just a liquid creamsicle, you couldn't taste the energy drinkness. It literally devastated me when it disappeared."

32973,"Bang Blue Razz just has a nice classic blue raspberry taste that isn’t overly sweet. Reign’s Orange Dreamsicle is good but a little too chemical tasting.

32995,Monster Citron (rip)...the best. No calories no sugar....amazing citrusy zing! Beautiful yellow can
32996,"Best: Pipeline Punch (Even after the juice reduction IMO)

Worst: Monster absolutely zero (not ultra, the one with the blue monster logo)"
32997,"It's hard to pick a best because I like so many.

Worst is Bang Miami Cola."
32998,"Really liking monster paradise or reign sour apple at the moment! 

Worse by far is 3d carnival candy, could barely finish it"
32999,Well there r Energy Drinks I like and Energy Drinks I don't like. I think taste ij general is too different to say worst and best
33000,Best & worst at the same time is red bull sugarfree lol
33001,"Best current: Monster Pacific Punch
     
Best ever: Pimp Juice

Worst ever: Monster White Dragon Tea"
33002,"best: monster ultra violet & rosa, reign lychee

worst: any bang or nos. tastes like gasoline"
33003,"hmmm, So far...

Best:  Rockatar Pure Zero Tagerine Mango Guava Strawberry (YES thats one flavor lol)

Watermelon Red bull is a very close second best.

Worst: original Monster or Most Bang energy drinks (has a bad aftertase)"
33004,White monster is the best. Anything watermelon is the worst
33005,"Best: Monster Ultra White & The Doctor

Worst: Red Bull regular

Honorary mention: Monster regular belong to the ""in-between"". Great at first sip but feels to syrupy to me.

Sorry I rarely drink energy drinks."
33006,White Monster is the go to for me and the most frequented.  But Reign White Gummy Bear and the Original NOS are a close 2nd and 3rd.... and I won't say they are the worst but my least favorite are the Bangs.
33007,"Rockstar original is definitely the worst.
For me the best is between full throttle citrus and AMP. The citrus flavors do it for me."
33008,Well healthy is a bit different for a lot of people. What are you trying to avoid? Sugar? Artificial sweeteners? Artificial Caffeine? GMOs?
33009,Honestly I'm not sure I'm trying to get into shape I'm a crane operator so I do a lot of sitting i recently started martial arts and realized I'm way out of shape now for it and just looking for something all around healthy I guess I'm 23 Y.o I've never done any kind of dieting like this or worried about what I put into my body but after some rigorous exercise I realize I probably should
33010,"I’d just avoid the drinks with high sugar content and calorie count then. Obviously don’t go insane on energy drinks, but a sugar free energy drink even once a day shouldn’t be harmful longterm, especially if you are active."
33011,Yeah I dont normally like drinking more than one it makes me feel shitty ive been on those c4s for a while now and just seen the ghost today and liked the flavor and was curious to see if there was healthier ones or better ones in general but thanks for the info
33012,"I mean there are some ‘healthier’ energy drinks, but most of them probably don’t have the caffeine/energy boost you are looking for. Zevia Energy uses a 0 calorie natural sweetener called Stevia instead of artificial stuff like sucralose, but it only has 120mg / can. There’s also a decently popular brand called Celsius that is generally considered healthier (200mg / can). There’s also some really really low caffeine drinks that are generally healthy like Bai (55mg / can)."
33013,Yeah I dont think I can do without the caffeine I normally wake up 2 am
33014,You gettin enough sleep homie?
33015,Sleep is for the weak
33016,"Stick to any zero cal energy drinks, white monster would suit you best. Stop eating shit every week and go hard with your martial arts. You got this bro"
33017,"Lmao, how'd you know i eat like shit"
33018,Your post gives off the impression that you don’t know much about this side of life - which is fine because you are here to learn more and fix that
33019,"Healthiest energy drinks I know of would be Celsius 200 mg, c4, rowdy 160mg, and alani 200mg would be my top picks. Mountain dew rise isn't a bad alternative at 180mg High caffeine relatively healthy, bang and reigns (300mg)"
33020,"Unless there is something you specifically object to, all you really need are drinks with 0g of sugar, which is most of what's on the market. Every brand I can think of has at least some 0g flavors, and many of the best tasting lines are exclusively sugar-free. Generally I'd recommend giving the following lines a chance: 3D, Adrenaline Shoc, Alani Nu, Beyond Raw, C4, and Xyience. If you need something value-oriented, the sugar free releases from Summit (an Aldi brand) are $1 each and surprisingly good. If you want maximum energy sans sugar, you want Total War RTD, which you can generally find at the Vitamin Shoppe, but it is pricey and targeted towards gym bros."
33021,"I drink heavy/strong green tea ( 4 tea bags at once) as an alternative to coffee and energy drinks. Green tea is especially unique, the more you drink, the healthier you'll be !"
33022,Has to be for me either Khaos or Assalult monster
33023,"Taste? Black Cherry Vanilla by Bang. Even though I don't drink energy drinks anymore, it is still my favorite"
33024,"For me Monster Ultra Blue. I wasn't too sold on it at first, then after my 2nd can of it I was hooked. It's so addictive and refreshing but sweet. I find it so moreish because its light and crisp.

But Ultra Red I find super delicious too, something nostalgic about it like red slush puppy from when I was a child!

Otherwise original Rockstar energy is delicious. Tastes so good.

As you can tell I drink energy drinks for the flavour, not necessarily the energy itself aha"
33025,"Hard to choose a favorite. 

Consistent drinking: Rockstar Recovery, primarily lemonade.

Really tasty but probably easy to get sick of: Bang Key Like Pie

Bang for your buck: Venom Watermelon Lime or Strawberry Apple, $1 each! 

Other highlights: Monster Juice Papillon, Reign Orange Dreamsicle, Monster Ultra (White, though the whole line is solid too)"
33026,"Rockstar cola.

Like a mix of coke and cream soda. Literally the most delicious liquid I have ever put into my body. I get excited whenever I see a new energy cola, but they all end up tasting like flat RC cola. 

I miss is so much. 

Rockstar frozen lime was great too. Really tangy and citrus-ey without having that gross sour patch kids flavor that's so popular now. It was really refreshing while doing yard work in the summer."
33027,Original NOS/Monster Maxx Super Dry/Bang Candy Apple Crisp
33028,Monster ripper yellow flavor
33029,"Just tried key lime pie bang for the first time, without a doubt my favorite 🤩"
33030,In my opinion? Coffee. Alternate between that and water.
33032,coffee and weed
33033,"energy drinks are overrated and are terrible for you. I would suggest coffee/mocha. Not saying its healthy, but definitely better than a Monster or Redbull"
33034,"Monster. 

Just don't drink more than one can or you might die (seriously--there's a warning on the can and I'm pretty sure 2 people have actually died because they drank too much Monster)"
33035,Coffee and Dayquil
33036,So just drink 2x? So u have about 320mg caffeine and after that one espresso or before haha Sry but i think my heart would explode... I couldn't think clear anymore after that content of caffeine.. Good luck :)
33037,The issue with this is that now you are consuming a massive amount of sugar
33038,Well he asked for with sugar and if i would drink 2x Pipeline  Punch (2x 8.5g) for example I would drink literally drink 1x can  RockstarEnergy (1x15.8g) from the sugar content but double caffeine.. Sry i always hated math haha
33039,Idk if cocain  energy is sugarfree or not but look into that. Otherwise just get a mega monster (extra big can) or drink coffee
33040,"Only sugar free that I can tolerate is Monster Mule. Give it a try!  Aside from that, by far my favourite is Nitro.  The new Assault is OK too if you’re into cola, but it’s not as good as the original.  They’re all 160mg caffeine though, which is more than enough for me."
33041,Where is sugar free monster mule? I’ve only seen it full sugar which has a ridiculous amount around 60 g
33042,The UK and Europe.  I’ll swap you the full sugar version any day.
33043,"Have a look here: https://www.caffeineinformer.com/energy-drinks-caffeine

The standard is around 80mg/8fl oz though for energy drinks. 

Espresso coffees are quite strong but a different category drink…"
33044,"Yea I always have to remind people that I don't like sugar free energy drinks when they try to recommend one to me. My favorite energy drinks now are Full Throttle, Monster Nitro, and I'm still sad that it's gone Rockstar Killer Citrus."
33045,Have you ever considered using a powdered energy drink that you can pick how much you make each serving? 2 scoops when you need extra caffeine or 1 scoop when you just want something nice?

33051,this. plus energy drinks taste like shit.
33052,"I only use them when I really need them.

* **5 Hour Energy** - This is my favorite. The small size makes it easy to down quickly and I can store them easily. The energy kicks in in about a half hour. It is gradual and effective. I d not get jittery on it, it simply wakes me up. The come down is also gradual.

* **Monster** - I like this for the taste. It provides pretty good energy but it is not as smooth as 5 Hour.

* **Red Bull** - Good balance of flavor and energy. However, I have had panic attacks on this for some reason.

* **Red Jak** - Best tasting I think. I just do not get a very effective energy boost from this one."
33053,Upvoted because finally someone that drinks Red Jak too! :)
33054,Powerthirst! Because I want to be UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC!
33055,I can't believe no one has mentioned Bawls here. Bawls FTW.
33057,I love having Bawls in my mouth!
33058,"No.

They are little better than colas in terms of false promises and misleading advertising.  What the heck's wrong with eating healthy, exercising regularly, and getting a reasonable amount of rest?"

33072,"I don't drink energy drinks. I hate feeling cracked out and I'm somewhat hyper active as it is, and I always get plenty of sleep so I don't feel like I need them. The one or two times I did try a Monster or Red Bull, I had pretty severe backpain because it was just too hard on my liver and kidneys.

The stuffs bad for you. Get more sleep and eat better."

That is all."

33075,"Actually, it didn't need to be fixed.  That's how I drink them...but I'm willing to do a little research with your new formulas.  You, sir, may be some kind of genius....we'll have to wait and see."
33076,"Not a Genius, he is cultured."
33077,"I'm not a part of your ""system."""
33078,A: No. Why: Naps are cheaper and healthier.
33079,"Ya, but naps aren't allowed at work :("
33080,"Is it bad that I spent a good five seconds trying to figure out what drug ""naps"" was slang for?"
33081,"Nah it's cool, I like to mainline my naps. I even get ""sleep marks"" on my face if I take naps too often."
33082,I feel you. My boss saw my 'nap marks' and it led to a performance review.
33083,But I swear I can stop any time I want.
33084,"no thanks. 

corn syrup and chemicals."
33085,"My girlfriend describes energy drinks as ""Flavored Douche Water"""
33086,"I occasionally will drink a red bull during a long car ride, but I typically prefer coffee."
33087,"No: Way too much sugar or whatever fake shit they put in there. However, given the choice of a nap or a stimulant, I'd take a cup of coffee with soymilk and no added sugar. Naps don't work well for me. Damn you, sleep paralysis."

33090,"I'm a big fan of kombucha (Synergy is a good brand).  It's a little pricey but it's easy to make yourself if you can get your hands on a SCOBY... and fun.

It's refreshing and energizing without all the other crap that's usually in energy drinks.  It's actually supposed to be good for you."
33091,upvoted for kombucha awareness.
33092,"Coffee, and lots of it, it allows me to code faster."
33093,"Redline. The only energy drink you have to be 18 or older to purchase. It has a series of warning labels. Youre only supposed to drink half to bottle the first time you drink it to assess tolerance and it doubles as a work out supplement that burns fat when you train. 

It's the only thing that kicks you in the fucking face when you need it to."
33094,It's not the only... There was this other kind I had a month ago. I forget the name but you had to be 18 to buy it.
33095,"well, i guess the only one ive ever seen. i know that there is another one called meltdown but its owned by the same company and does the exact same thing."
33096,A: No. Why: They taste like shit.
33097,Try some varieties of Amp Energy. Their orange and purple flavors are amazing.
33098,love me some purple drank
33099,"Yeah, it's got sugar, water, and... purple."
33100,I drink so much of that stuff I think I'm going to have heart palpitations.
33101,That's how you know it's working!
33102,"Yes I love how the savory taste of vegetable oil combines with flavors named after colors.

No seriously, [look at the ingredients](http://www.beveragesdirect.com/detail-682-AMP_Energy_Drink_24_Pack.asp).  They put oil in there so you'll drink it faster.  YUMMMMM.

But don't worry!  It's only a 'small quantity', [""as its concentration is regulated by the US, and banned in 100 other countries.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew).  So, you can [FEEL SAFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_vegetable_oil#Health_effect) while drinking it!!!!"
33103,"> ""as its concentration is regulated by the US, and banned in 100 other countries.""
And thus presumably only grandfathered in; the FDA is unusual in that it is very unwilling to ban anything that's already in wild. Potassium bromate is another popular one; it appears to be illegal just about everywhere except the US."
33104,I always thought amp tasted like melted jello.  Its weird but awesome.
33105,"I really like the Amp Lemonade... probably the most delicious energy drink i've tried so far... Also, the Xyience (sp?) energy drinks are really good as well, green apple, mango, razz, and blueberry-guava i think..."
33106,Those flavours are like drinking freezies :)
33107,Amp Yellow is the pinnacle of energy drinks.
33108,"I do not use them. I get up at 5am and jog for 30 minutes. Take a shower, eat breakfast and go to work. I work at a desk for 9 hours (1 hour lunch break) then go back home. If it's Monday or Wednesday I watch my son for an hour while my wife goes to water aerobics with her sisters. If it is Tuesday or Thursday my wife watches the kid while I go boxing with my friends. Then I make dinner and play with the kid until around 9-10pm depending on when he'll go to sleep. Then we go to bed. At no point in my day do I ever lack for energy."
33109,I should clarify one point I suppose. I don't drink coffee but I do drink about two Diet Cokes a day. So I get some caffeine.
33110,Dear advertisers that don't want to pay for focus groups...
33111,"They get what they pay for, though."
33112,I drink the cheapest brand because they all taste the same but coffee doesn't work for me.
33113,"I don't anymore, Those NOS drinks were my favorite, I'd drink Monster if those weren't available, and because they made me crazy and I'd talk too much. Coffee is much better. Also, lots of sugar and calories, it adds up when you start getting old."
33114,"There was an /r/IAmA about a guy who reviewed energy drinks for a living a while back.  It had his top picks, and was very insightful.  You might try looking for that."
33115,"I don't because I don't want a regular intake of caffeine.  I don't mind getting some foofy bullshit from Starbucks now and again, but I actually stopped drinking Coca Cola (my one true love) in September of 2007 because of the caffeine.  Well, that and the fact that I probably shouldn't have been drinking as much soda as I was drinking in the first place.

I will say that, in general, I don't perceive an energy increase from caffeine.  That's not to say it doesn't happen, but I never notice it."
33116,"When I used energy drinks, I really liked Monster KHAOS. 

Caffeine makes me too anxious, and the crash hits me hard. I feel better without the stuff. I still drink soda a few times a month."
33117,"Adderall is the best energy drink! Right next to, Vermonster"
33118,i love me some amphetamine salts
33119,"Don't need it, thats what fucking my sleep schedule since middle school will do"
33120,"I drink one low carb monster or zero carb rockstar every morning. I drink one because I really don't like coffee. Also, I exercise and sleep enough but the caffeine is supposed to be good for my liver, since I drink too much alcohol."
33121,"For myself, I drink AMP, which taste the fruitiest and does contain the less destructive crap.

I used to drink Full Throttle and then I saw how much the thing was destroying my stomach."
33122,How did you see it destroying your stomach?
33123,X-Rays
33124,Redline.  Even though I'm sure every bottle of it takes 3 years off of your life.
33125,"No.

I remember drinking a full can of Monster for a biology lab last year and my nerves were shot. I got the whole eye twitching, shaking hands type-deal. It kept me up, but it also made me feel uncomfortable and jumpy. Instead, I'll just take a short walk or a nap to wake me up."
33126,"It used to be Red Bull.  It does not work for me anymore.  Now I just make fucking strong coffee.

But I do buy a Red Bull on the occasion still...hoping it'll wake me up..."
33127,"I do, I like Purple(Grape) NOS, and regular Monster, which I am currently not drinking because of their poor decision to go after the Vermonster beer. Hopefully they will apologize soon and leave Vermonster alone, and I will then be able to drink my favorite non-grape energy drink."
33128,"red bull, because it tastes better than coffee and I usually prefer something cold to something hot in the morning."
33129,"I used to drink redbull religiously, then full throttle (bigger cans) I had approx 2-3 cans a day of this stuff. 

I've since stopped. It is *so incredibly* bad for you. The amount of sugar, caffeine and other ridiculous ingredients do nothing but harm. 

Mind you, I still have some once in a while, and I LOVE redbull+vodka @ parties but I notice that long term usage actually makes me more tired. 

tl;dr: *the crash is not worth the limited energy boost*"
33130,"No

Why?  I just don't handle caffeine well.  I went on a health kick in college after drinking almost a case of soda a day for a while.  Stopped drinking caffeine in any form.  Since then I've been almost entirely unable to drink caffeine.  It makes me ridiculously jittery and twitchy.  It feels awful.  I drank a bottle of NoS once at a LAN and ended up being up for the next day and night.  My body was completely exhausted but i was still wide awake.  It was a horrible experience."
33131,"I like the ""No Fear"" brand, blue can only because it doesn't have HFCS, albeit it does have some aspartame, but it also has real juice in it."
33132,"No:... I used to drink 3 or 4 of them a week (along with a water when I went to the gym).. but after a while I noticed irregular heartbeats (especially under high intensity workouts or stress)... could be that was a pre-existing condition, could also be the energy drinks were making the condition worse.. so I stopped. 

I don't exercise as much anymore... but I also quit energy drinks and am trying to minimize my soda (to 1 or 2 a week)... and I feel much healthier."
33133,I used to be a Sobe Adrenaline Rush junkie.  I'd supplement that with Amp from time to time.  Then I stopped drinking all sodas and energy drinks.
33134,"Yes, but typically only the Java Monster drinks.  Fave flavors are Mean Bean and Loca Moca.  Russian and Lo-Ball aren't bad either.  The fiance prefers the Amp/NOS/Full Throttle style drinks but I can't stand the way they taste."
33135,an apple gives you just as much energy.
33136,[I drink this daily.](http://www.booker.co.uk/bbimages/55146_1_ID%20Shot_200_200.jpg) We call it Ian's mum because it's cheap.
33137,"I drink them, but not as often as I used to. I have energy drinks less than I drink soda. If I am driving somewhere for more than 3 or 4 hours I usually drink one throughout the first hour(then switch to water). If I have to be up very late for some reason I'll drink one then as well. When I worked third shift I used to drink them more frequently, but I found that I don't really need them if I keep a regular schedule as much as possible, eat healthier and be more active, and now see them more as a mixer than something to keep me awake."
33138,Man! I'm not going to let you poison me.  You must think I'm a [joke](http://www.hulu.com/watch/99944/saturday-night-live-digital-short-on-the-ground#s-p1-sr-i2)!
33140,"The only one I actually care for is rockstar juiced. It's the one in an orange can and contains quite a bit of actual juice (along with assorted sugars and caffeine I'm sure). 

It tastes descent and it's the only one of the energy drinks where I have a truly noticeable feeling of 'oh shit, I'm all amped up'. 

Other than that, energy drinks are like medicine. I only drink them if I'm trying to stay awake on a late night drive or something like that."
33141,"On occasion.  And that occasion is if I'm uncomfortably and unusually tired that day, even after getting good meal, enough water, my daily tea ration, and a full night's sleep.

Energy drinks, for me, are a way of keeping me alert long enough to do just one more thing in the day.  I usually only drink ones with no artificial sweeteners (sadly only Monster is available here), and I prefer coffee to these B-vitamin infused snake oil cans."
33142,mate! brewed rainforest leaves!
33143,"Redbull.  I hate the taste.  It doesn't give me any useful amount of energy.  Still, I feel like I need the taste of taurine in my mouth, so I keep drinking it."
33144,"I'm confused as to why all these kids need ""energy drinks"" all of a sudden.  Most highschool age kids are pretty fucking sedentary, playing online, playing video games, etc.  You don't need energy drinks, you just need to get off your ass and actually do something, eat healthy, etc.  You will have natural energy."
33145,"Xyience is good stuff.  0 calories, no sugar, actually gives you some energy.  Just a bunch of B vitamins."
33146,"I used to drink Rockstars every day. I stopped because I gained a lot of weight. I still drink one once or twice a year probably, but I pretty much stick to coffee since it only has about 4 calories the way I drink it."
33147,"I like this one the most: http://blog.stillaslife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/rockstar_juiced_in_glass.jpg

I also like the other ""JUICED"" varieties. I think they taste good. It's probably just a placebo effect but I like them."
33148,"For me. Energy drinks are more disposable ashtrays in my car than anything else. So I don't mind getting the cheapo $1.99 Ed hardy ones or whatever is there. 

For actual flavor. I like the blue full throttle, sugar free rock star, sugar free redbull, and all of the amp ones (green, blue, purple, red, yellow)

I guess the answer to your question is Amp. 


**EDIT:** actually. Now that I think about it, whenever I can find the vitamin water energy drinks, I'll get those. Red and yellow are my favorite


I really need to stop drinking these things now that I think about it. When I have work early in the morning, my breakfast is usually an energy drink and a bunch of ciggarettes."
33149,"sobe no fear gold is crack.  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wby2K7MMQwE/Sd0AsTRmkMI/AAAAAAAABa8/sdNkOASFWoA/s400/sobe+no+fear+gold.jpg

let's just say once i started drinking those red bulls did absolutely nothing for me."
33150,"There's a Canadian company called Guru that makes a pretty good one. They have shitty distribution though, so they're hard to find. I mainly drink Amp Blue now.

Moderation's the key with these - they can be a wild ride. I write quite a bit, and prefer writing at night. So a couple times a month I decide that staying up till 3 in the morning is a fantastic idea, and with my otherwise regular sleep schedule, an energy drink around 10-11 is a necessary step for this."
33151,"I've been drinking [Endorush](http://energy-drink-ratings.blogspot.com/2007/05/endorush-fruit-punch-energy-drink.html) for a few weeks now.  The entire bottle is coated in a warning label trying to convince you to not chug it and instead spread it out through the day.  I spread it out over two days per bottle and it works fine.  Just be sure to keep in in the fridge between sips because it does spoil after opening otherwise.  I can't drink coffee or tea because the caffeine gives me stomach acid problems (I've even tried brewing several green teas), but I've had no problems with this stuff.  Tastes fine too."
33152,"I've been digging the No Fear Motherload and Bloodshot, as well as Rockstar Roasted Latte. Love Redbull though, tastes like a can of sweet tarts."
33153,TANTRUM!
33154,"Why on earth would anyone want to? If I want caffeine, I will drink coffee. If I want water, I will drink water. If I want calories, I will eat food. What else are they supposed to provide?"
33155,"They taste like crap, but I still drink the Monster Lo-Carb one whenever I have a big test coming up and I haven't been getting enough sleep. unfortunately I acquired a taste for it and I kinda like them now... :|"
33156,My brother did a good job describing why he drinks energy drinks the other day. He is a carpenter and I work in IT at a desk all day. He said he cant drink coffee anymore at work because it just makes him want to relax. So he just pounds back an energy drink when he gets to work and is ready to start hammering nails all day. I on the other hand get to work with my coffee and relax at my desk while sipping that sweet java cup for the first hour of work.
33157,"I used to drink them, brand didn't matter to me much, there were so many varieties at 7-11. I would usually just choose the one that looked the newest. Until I tried ""Big Beaver Buzz"", that shit fucked me up beyond belief. Not only did it have every god damn additive that all the other drinks only picked and choosed from, they had the highest concentration of those extra additives. I felt really on edge and shaky for and entire work day, then around 6pmish when I was driving home, I got tunnel vision and had to quickly gather enough focus to pull over. I sat in my car for about 20 minutes, breathing heavily - trying not to pass out. I managed to gather enough energy to start heading home, which luckily I was only 4-5 blocks away from at that point, and once I made it to my bedroom I passed out. 13 hours of sleep later I woke up feeling kinda like I had the flu, no coughing or puking or anything, just fluish. But damn was I tired, like I didn't even sleep but that feeling only lasted maybe half a day or so. Ever since then, I get tunnel vision when I drink more than a couple glasses or coffee or 1 energy drink, doesn't matter which one, they all fuck me up. Lately I've found anything with stimulants in them cause my body to just shut down, like this one time my coworker showed me a fat burner he was taking called ""Ripped Freak"" which I called bullshit on, I told him to just stop eating like shit. He ended up giving me a days dose to try, thinking it would shut me up or something. I figured it would've done nothing and I popped those mother fuckers back (with water, I thought I learned my lesson at this point) but that flu-ish feeling I referred to earlier came back HARD, hit me like a ton of bricks. I went home from work within an hour of that and just had to sleep. I think that god damn Beaver Buzz fucked me up permanently, I have to always watch my caffeine intake, which really is next to nothing right now. The positive thing is at least I had to stop relying on caffeine in the morning and resorted to changing my diet and exercising in the mornings (losing 40 pounds in the process). I'm glad that I now don't need caffeine to get through the day, but keep your kids away from the beaver buzz, that shit will fuck you up."
33158,PG Tips
33159,"Yes.

Rip It Citrus X flavor it's milder than most energy drinks and tastes pretty good. They also have a lime flavor and pomegranate flavor that's pretty tasty.

http://ripitenergy.com/site/"
33160,"I had a bad addiction to energy drinks.  AMP mostly.  Kicked that habit though.  Smoking also.  but for some reason, I am not seeing the money I am supposed to be saving by not purchasing those items...."
33161,"Rockstar and Red Bull. Red Bull is so damn expensive though, I feel like an idiot spending $20 on a 12 pack."
33162,"I find it pretty entertaining that Reddit people are dead-set against Energy drinks because they (Gasp!) have sugar and might cause cancer, but are perfectly ok with marijuana, LSD, and other hallucinogenic drugs."
33163,"Yeah, I drink 1-2 a day at work - usually the red Full Throttle, but lately it's been the various Mountain Dew Amped drinks, cause the local store has them on 2 for 1"
33164,"Never, because they taste DISGUSTING.

Except once in a rare while I'll have that Rockstar shit that's energy drink plus 7% alcohol or whatever. Man. If you ever want to seem like a crackhead, that's amazing shit."
33165,"Never bought one. Drink green, white, or red tea instead. If you need bubbles mix with club soda or sugar-free 7up or sprite or something."
33166,5 hour energy is by far the best
33167,"This stuff ran right through me.  Gave me the worst case of the mudbutt I've had in a very, very long time.  Bonus: was at an amusement park and couldn't ride a single rollercoaster because I was afraid I would shit myself."
33168,Why would you need an energy drink at an amusement park? Wouldn't the rollercoasters provide energy naturally for you?
33169,"I was up late the night before and we left early to get down there.  I didn't want to sleep on the way down so I threw back one of these.  Nobody told me to shoot half of it now, and then half later."
33170,"Yeah, I agree. I drink one maybe once a week. half in the morning/half in the afternoon."
33171,"Without a doubt, 5 hour is the only one that actually works for me."
33173,its basically just a shot of caffeine
33174,"only as much as a cup of coffee- with no sugar, its hard to understand their claims. either way, smart marketing."
33175,"that is enough caffeine to wake you up, which is all it really does"
33176,Right. Just not five hours worth.
33177,"no, i only take it when i have to be at work or to coach a game at the butt crack of dawn."
