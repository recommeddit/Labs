25986,"If it was easy to fulfill your agenda, we'd be living in a utopia.

Brick walls are there because of varying opinions and special interests. 

What is a brick wall for you is a defense mechanism for someone else. If you ever fulfill your agenda, you'd have to brick wall the next guy.

I think you think you'd be good at politics only because you don't know very much about them."
25987,"I think that the corruption is so thoroughly entrenched in our political system that one person, or even a few good people can make any meaningful difference.  The only way to accomplish something worthwhile seems to be to make promises that ultimately compromise your principles.  Once you move down that path, compromise gets easier and easier until you are part of the problem.

However, I do believe that there are fundamentally good politicians."
25988,"I would also be good at politics, but I'm not 35, haven't served in the military, don't believe in god, but I do believe in equal rights for everyone. Therefor I have no chance of getting elected."
25989,">Dear Reddit: Are there any ""good"" politicians?

Senator Bernie Sanders.

>What I mean to say is, is it feasible to accomplish good things in government or will I run into brick walls constantly dealing with the system?

Yes, and yes."
25990,"Towns all over the world are afflicted with piles of excruciating minutia that combine to hinder the overall well-being of the place and its inhabitants, whether it's the condition of the roads, the pH levels of the local reservoirs, excessive light pollution from the factory down the road at times when it isn't even operational, etc.  These are (generally) small things that one person or a small committee can actually change for the better.

Spearhead a campaign for a new park, or a preservation drive for a local nature site.  Ask people in your town or city what bothers them the most, and try to figure out novel ways which require *the least amount of effort from other people in the government as possible* to alleviate or eliminate those issues.

Also keep in mind that you don't need to become a politician to become involved in politics.  If you're truly intelligent, and you have great ideas for how to better a society but don't want to surrender entirely to its political systems, get a degree related to your interests and join a think-tank or NGO that generally appears to follow your own line of morality.

I'm curious, though, as to why exactly you think you'd make a good politician."
25991,"I'm very good at convincing people of a particular cause as well as very good at understanding people's motivations.

I'm excellent in sales. I can practically sell anyone on any idea - if I try hard enough.

This is why I'm getting involved in Grant Writing - which I think I will enjoy more. I get to help people, without surrendering to political systems.. like you said."
25992,do you own a gun?  kill everybody thar disagrees with you and if you are right you can have much sex with teenage girls
25993,"While I dislike Austin Petersen as a person (I think he's kinda arrogant) and I disagree with about half of what he says, I think he genuinely believes the things he's saying and actually understands why he believes them rather than just being a corporate shill, an idiot, or a partisan hack like so many politicians today. Even if he's wrong, which I think he is now and again, I don't think he's a liar or a shill.

As for politicians that I think are doing a good job, the best I could give you is maybe James Mattis (current Secretary of Defense), but he's more soldier than politician."
25994,"I think that Rand Paul & Sanders have honest moral convictions that aren’t easily swayed by political correctness or even popular opinion. I only personally agree with one of them, but I at least respect them both."
25995,Good call not naming which you support. Keeps things on topic.
25996,Paul vs. Sanders seems to be quite common wish.
25997,"I would vote for either to as my senator for the reasons OP lists, but I don't know that I could vote for either of them for president based on their policies."
25998,Fortunately you don't have to even if it happens.
25999,"I think most politicians in the American West tend to be less corrupt, on both the left and the right.

For example, I think the recent governors of Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico are honest people. On the right, I think Gary Johnson is a true believer in what he says and an honest broker who isn't corruptible. On the center left, I think John Hickenlooper is fair-minded and reasonable. He'll listen to opposing voices. On the left, I don't think anyone can seriously accuse Kate Brown of corruption.

I think most of America's corruption comes from the deep South on the right and the big city political machines on the left. I think corruption is more regional than ideological. Having said that, on a national level, I think the current Congress and President are undoubtedly the most corrupt in at least 100 years."

26005,"+1 on Ron Wyden. That guy basically singlehandedly held PIPA (Senate version of SOPA) and CISPA from being passed until public outrage and sentiment against got them scuttled.

Well CISPA was just thrown into a drawer and a reworked version of it, CISA, actually did pass as part of a 2015 omnibus spending bill..."
26007,"I offer that good would be defined as honestly representing their constituents and the constitution, which is probably not as prevalent as you think.

Between corporate contributions and having to toe the party line, there's a lot of misrepresentation going around.  But for some reason people think that's okay."
26008,"I feel like the idea that politicians vote for the sake of corporate contributions is a little overblown. It could easily be the other way around: corporations donate to politicians who profess the belief that low corporate taxes and deregulation are good for the middle class. Many people do genuinely believe that.

I doubt it's all one or the other, but the idea that all GOP politicians vote FOR money seems too common on reddit.

Toeing the party line is more of a problem, I believe, as has been demonstrated in the past few months."
26010,"> OK. Tell that to the Freedom Caucus. 

The fact that you would illustrate a second master both confirms the status quo and adds another vehicle for representatives to betray their constituents.

> ""Honestly representing their constituents and the constitution"" is as vague an answer as this vague-ass question. 

Sure, but it's a specific criterion that requires a little brain power to evaluate.  To claim it's useless because it doesn't provide an in-hand metric for the entire legislature is stupid.

> So if my representative is in Texas, how does he or she honestly represent the constitution? They represent their constituents who feel one way or the other.

They have an obligation to both.  And it gets deeper, because they have to weigh (probably) a majority's desire to have fullies with drum mags to hunt and masturbate to, against a minority whose lives may be in the balance.  Throw on top of that one's interpretation of the right to bear arms and you have a difficult question that is worthy of being someone's day job.

For what it's worth."
26020,"I'm not a fan of his at all, but at least he's not a hypocrite."
26021,People in prison aren't there because of Rand Paul. They're there because they committed a crime.
26022,"They're in *private* prison because Rand Paul and other libertarian advocate for them over public prisons, despite the fact that [private prisons are less safe and more expensive.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/08/12/private-federal-prisons-less-safe-less-secure/?utm_term=.9010308b0a3a). This is consistent [with their dogma that the free market is a one-size-fits-all solution for all problems.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/7fuwy7/in_a_libertarian_system_what_protections_are/dqf0wgh/)"
26023,"> that private prisons are less safe and more expensive.

I'm not going to lose sleep over this. Don't break the law; don't go to prison."
26024,"Even if you don't care a whit about prisoner safety (frankly, most Republicans don't), or about the ethical concerns of ceding the government's [monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence) to a private corporation, you should still be concerned that the government is wasting money on a more expensive solution when a cheaper, better one is available."
26025,"I mean one of the reasons its more expensive is because it isn't there as a first resort. It's usually overflow or providing a service not otherwise available. 

Do you a) build a new jail to host 10 prisoners for 100 million dollars and then upkeep is 10 million a year or b) send them to a private prison at a cost of 2.5 million dollars a year

because not everyone has the need or money for C) build a prison to keep 1000 prisoners for 50k ea."

26029,I don't hate him but he's insane.
26030,"none of his ideas are really crazy, people get all riled up about free college as if its some revolutionary idea, its not. europe has free college, and its not like free education as a whole is something strange, we have it now up to HS. of course ya know taxes, but its not like we dont pay that now for highschool."
26031,"I think he's nuttier than a squirrel turd, and we probably don't agree on much more than the weather or what time it is, but he is one of the more honest people you'll find in Congress."
26032,And he's one of the few congressmen that is not a sell out.
26033,Except for when he sold out his base and movement to endorse Hillary after it was exposed the DNC rigged everything against him and his movement/supporters had no chance in hell from the start.
26034,"What else did you expect him to do? Hillary was still a democrat and it would make the most sense for him to get his supporters on her side. Especially if a man as polarizing as Trump was leading on the republican side. People unite to take down a common enemy all the time, even if they don't like each other. I wouldn't call that selling out at all."
26035,Even Bernie knew that Trump > Hillary on the shittiness scale.
26036,"I'd agree if he just lost, however, it was proven the DNC literally rigged it against him. Just swallowing that and accepting the rigging is not a good move. You are willfully acknowledging and bowing down to the DNC and showing it is ok for the DNC to choose your candidate, primary voters be damned."
26037,Sure. And Churchill with Roosevelt are sellouts for cooperating with Stalin on defeating Hitler.
26038,"That's hilarious. 

>The problem with Bernie is when he wanted to be a Democrat he was a Democrat."
26039,"I do think Bernie has been mostly consistent throughout his career with his beliefs and voting record, and he doesn't seem to be a shill or just in it for his donors, he truly fights for what he believes in. Although as a left leaning liberal I don't think he's the best representative for us."
26040,Who do you think is? If you mind me asking.
26041,I honestly think they're all shitheads.
26042,"Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett 

He is the one of the only ones that doesn’t toe the party line when doing the opposite is in his constituents’ best interests"
26043,I hope he wins the Governer race. He's done nothing but good for OKC.
26044,I expect him to win comfortably.
26045,"I'm sure he would in OKC, but I'm worried about Tulsa and the rest of the state."
26046,"I think most of them have strong convictions, a strong point of view, and a strong belief in what needs to be done to set Washington D.C. right. After all, you do not give up your life to go to a remote city (and have to obtain a second home in one of the most expensive cities in the country), leaving your family at home for weeks at a time, if you don't have a strong conviction and a strong civic desire to help the country.

(Most stories about how congress critters get wealthy off the public largess of their office simply don't happen; the ones we hear of are probably the exception than the rule.)

That said, I believe they all are lying like cheap rugs, only because some of their heartfelt convictions do not align with either the voters who voted for them, or the party under whose banner they ran."
26047,"The fact that people are downvoting every single comment that mentions a politician they disagree with is ridiculous.

Edit: And my shockingly un-American comment too, apparently."
26048,"That's how this sub is when there's a question like this. God forbid you mention Bernie Sanders here, as you've probably already seen. Downvotes are for wrong answers or misleading info, not for subjective disagreement. I dislike Rand Paul's politics, for example, but I'm not going to downvote someone who thinks he's the cat's pajamas.

(That's two things that'll probably get me downvoted. I forgive you who do that.)"
26049,Have an upvote.  You're up to four now!
26050,"Maryland governor Larry Hogan. If you aren’t from Maryland, you probably haven’t heard of him because he’s mostly focused on state issues. I’m a democrat, so I don’t always agree with Hogan, but he’s willing to reach across the aisle in good faith so the least I can do is reach back."
26051,"Bernie Sanders and Bob Corker. Funnily enough, they're almost polar opposites too."
26052,"I genuinely trust my representatives in Congress: Patty Murray, Maria Cantwell and Pramila Jayapal (though I may sadly be leaving her district soon). Cantwell I had all kinds of reservations about when she first ran, but she's exceeded my expectations by quite a bit. More locally, Bob Ferguson's been excellent as AG, with a serious focus on protecting consumers and civil liberties rather than the usual lock 'em up as long as possible that AGs often go for."
26053,"Chris Coons (D-DE)

I got the chance to meet him for about an hour when I was in DC. The first thing I asked him was where his body guards (I had never seen a senator before.) He just laughed and spent a decent amount of time talking to me and my dad (he went to college with him). He didn't even expect/want to win his race until a tea party nutcase upset the established Republican that was going to cruise to victory."
26054,"Sanders, Warren"
26055,Bernie Sanders is the only one who has my respect.
26056,My rep Steve Cohen seems decent
26058,"Yeah ol' Bernie ""buy me a new vacation home you idiots"" Sanders is *super* trustworthy."
26059,"Hey, his wife took out a small loan of $10 million-

oh, and then ran the college she headed into the ground."
26060,"I do have a problem with this...  When his wife was president of Burlington not only did a land deal if it were a corporation Bernie would railing away about crony capitalism, but a large part of his platform was his ""free"" college plan...   And his wife tried to make Burlington more expensive and more exclusive.  Since they were the actions of Jane, and not Senator Sanders I try to remove that from my judgement of him, but it is hard not to attribute some hypocrisy to him for it."
26061,"Bernie Sanders. He's New deal democrat in an era where all the politicians are either moderate Republican or so far right they are off the spectrum(sorry about backing out of the Paris climate agreement and bumping up our carbon emissions btw)

26066,"Yeah, but that this to be expected on this sub. Threads like these always set off the libertarian/populist democrat core of this sub. They probably did call in the cavalry though

However, this particular post has a much more significant drop."
26067,Even if you hate Bernie I don't think you could make an argument that he's dishonest.
26069,">  I lost a lot of respect for him after he ran as a Democrat and a number his followers decided to abandon all forms of meaningful discourse.

How is this something that you can levy a criticism on him for though?  Did he say, or do anything to encourage that?"
26070,"As someone who has the same values and beliefs as him, I believe he was recklessly divisive. He got wrapped up in the bravado of the other two and started promising things he couldn’t back up. 

For example, we both want free college. He acted as though reducing the cost of college wasn’t good enough, but didn’t acknowledge that congress would have blocked any tax reform that would allow that to actually happen. False promises are harmful, regardless of who says them. 

His supporters are overall higher educated than others, so I would like to believe that they could have handled the discussion in a less “scream your views at people until they agree with you” method. He frequently lost his cool, and modeled that for others. 

What’s frustrating is that I was a fan of his long before he ran, yet I spent half of the election arguing with people that should have agreed with me. People acted like he was above reproach, and no one is."
26071,"Off hand....uh-huh Bernie Sanders,john McAfee,Trey Gowdy. Those stand out to me right now, there's more, no doubt, but these are the ones at the front of my brain. I could vote for any of those guys and sleep well."

It's so incredibly subjective. You might well ask ""who is your favorite politician?"" because I guarantee there would be little difference in responses.

You see a lot of inaccurate Sanders stuff now, before that was inaccurate Ron Paul stuff, and I'm sure some Ronnie Panders in the future will pick up the mantle.

26081,"God damn it, my entire point is that this is only a matter of opinion. Opinions that inevitably lead to flame wars. It's a silly thing to debate online"
26082,"In Illinois, we have lost our right to nominate trustworthy politicians."
26083,[auctions off this comment]
26084,"No politician is without some opponents. 

In American politics, the only ""politician"" that was widely respected while he was president was Washington. Hell, we would have let him be king but he didn't want glory. (At least that is what we are taught although, I have never read/heard anything to go against this)

Other than him, all our widely ""respected"" politicians have seemed to earn that title after they are dead. 

ex. Lincoln, sure he had supporters but also a lot of detractors. Now he is seen as the second best president we have had (after Washington) and is widely seen as a respectable figure. 

-------

I think there is too much passion involved in politics. It takes a historical perspective to really recognize the people who where honest and respectable. 

For example, I don't agree with most of what Ron Paul says, but I respect him. I think history will portray him as an honest politician who had well thought out ideas and didn't back down on his beliefs.

I feel I should know more about Australian politics. Are there any past politicians in Australia that everyone looks up to?"
26085,"Thanks for this. I figured from what I read (cough...Simpsons episodes I have seen) that Washington and Lincoln would have truly been the business. Just cause Abe was assassinated doesn't mean much really (How many people seriously would have ever seriously considered murdering John Lennon? And I hate hippies... ;-) ). I think America probably has the closest examples to respect politicians. But maybe that is just through me watching a lot of Hollywood shit in my life.

As for Australia. I have heard Billy Hughes and Gough Whitlam (Prime ministers) were respected but I am pretty sure due to the two party political system in Australia it would have been evenly divided."
26086,"It also depends on what you mean by respected. There are plenty of politicians that are respected by their own party. With Lincoln also remember that he was in the middle of a Civil War. There were quite a few people who didn't agree with him and literally fought against his ideas. (Well that is a simplification but basically right) It is only thorough a historical perspective (and people who disagreed with him dying off) that he became universally loved. 

I was just trying to find examples that were respected by the majority of Americans as well as internationally. (At least if the statues of Washington and Lincoln in the UK are any indication)"
26087,"I guess Hitler could have been respected by many people due to the fact that he was in the position to make a mess out of Europe alone, not that he was 'respected by the people' in that sense. So it opens the argument into a huge can of worms destroyed by semantics. Which probably means I need to revise the question. 

I would really like to have a Vietnamese person answer due to Ho Chi Minh... I think they might have some interesting info because people seem to all rate him highly (I guess I would as well if the west had been bashing on me for decades). Thailand sure love their King, but seemingly always hate their political parties. 

I'm hoping to find a leading politician in the world at some stage respected by most people, irrespective of their ethos. I'm thinking Lincoln  is probably to controversial due to the war situation."
26088,"The interesting thing about Washington as president is that he didn't actually *do* much.  He considered the Presidency more of an administrative position, that he was there to sign what Congress passed, and didn't try to do much policy-making himself.  So in that way, he was significantly different than pretty much every President to come after him.

That's why the history books focus almost solely on his role in the war and the Founding, and skip over his actual years in office.  There really isn't much to talk about.

(note: not saying this is either good or bad, just throwing in a little history...)"
26089,"Well yes that is true. Actually, most presidents didn't do much of anything throughout most of the 18th and 19th century. The constitution doesn't give the president much power. Sure there are certain things that really stand out in that period (Louisiana Purchase was almost entirely Jefferson's doing) but for the most part, the president didn't have much power.

Washington was different than every other president after him; however, he also set the standard for every president after him. The position wasn't really defined (besides what is outlined in the constitution) until he took office."
26090,"OK. starting to make sense now. The bastardisation of the constitution and bill of rights over time pretty much enabled all your political insanity (Not saying it's bad, I have no clue. But I think the process, like most countries is ridiculously convoluted.) . So in effect, the earlier Presidents were more just figureheads (like they should be) as opposed to delusional twits thinking they are somehow personally responsible for political and therefore social change. 

One thing is for sure. I am going to read up on US history. I am definitely no fan of US foreign policies (Vietnamese family members, and I lived in the middle east for 4 years... probably bias! hehe) but the history is some amazing reading."
26091,"You read up on US history and I will read up on Australian history. I feel I know a lot about American, European, and Asian history but next to nothing about Australian and Canadian. 

I feel like Australia, the US, and Canada have a lot in common culturally and socially."
26092,"We most definitely do. Whether that is a good or bad thing :)

I think you have the easier task at hand. You will cover most of our colonial history in an evening :) Indigenous history might be a little trickier :)"
26093,"Isn't this perhaps why he is so respected? He actually did his fucking job! What a concept ! 

A government official, a public servant, to me has the sole duty of being a sort of supreme administrator. They rarely take this role anymore at all so I am guessing any examples offered in this thread will likely be at least 100 years ago. 

Funny that such a huge guy in global history (Washington) and I know so little about him. Definitely need to bone up on this stuff. As a sun monkey here in the southern hemisphere , I am probably no more knowledgeable than the hicks I constantly ridicule."

26098,"I suppose part of it depends on what you mean by ""respected.""  I think a lot of people have it in their heads that a politician has to agree with them 100% on everything, or else he's a hack/sellout/traitor/etc.  And while, yes, there are issues that I consider make-or-break deals just as everyone else does, I think people need to recognize that you're never going to agree with your elected officials on every point.  You gotta figure out which issues really matter to you, and realize a lot of the little stuff doesn't matter so much.

When I was living in Minnesota (I moved this summer) I was honestly proud to have Al Franken as my Senator.  I agreed with him on a whole bunch of things, only disagreed with him on minor ones, and in general, every time I heard him talk on CSpan or whatever, he wasn't just saying things I agreed with, but things no one else was saying.  And that's what really made me respect him, that as a junior senator he was willing to stand up and speak his mind against things the political establishment favored.  (Him chewing the fuck out of BP's officials in the Senate hearings, while almost everyone else was playing softball, was one of his highlights.)

Plus, his bipartisan friendship with Rand Paul is pretty cool.  It gives me a little hope that maybe our parties could actually talk things out, if enough people quit just doing what their political machines tell them to.  

So, uh, pretty much I just want someone with intelligence, integrity, a cooperative spirit, and maybe a bit of a sense of humor.  Shame that's in such short supply in Washington."

26101,"Lincoln. The man was woefully unprepared for the job. He was an unexperienced, third tier candidate nominated by an infant party. One would doubt his ability to govern effectively in good times given the novelty of his party and slight resume, yet he gets elected amid the most catastrophic event in American history. He got the nation through the civil war with nothing more than intellect, reason, and good decision making. People don't really know this about Lincoln, but he was a chronic depressive prone to melancholy. The nation was on her death bed and Lincoln was able to overcome his personal demons and defficiencies to grind out a victory."
26102,"There's a lot about Lincoln that most people don't remember.

For example, rather than being a big popular hero in the north during the war, Lincoln was actually quite unpopular, and looked virtually certain to lose reelection to a lot of people.

Lincoln was also quite frankly a loser at life. He lost more elections then he won. His only experience in Federal office before being president was serving a single term in the house, before he was voted out of office."
26103,"He ran the country into a civil war, that wasn't necessary."
26104,"While Lincoln was an amazing president, he really did a bad job of running the war. He took way too long to replace McClellan and kept putting mediocre or bad generals in charge of the Eastern front. Also, he would have been a terrible president in the Reconstruction since his plan was incredibly conservative and would have continued the oppression of black people in the South."
26105,"That's the thing though, he wasn't a general. His overall grand strategy ended up working quite well, and that is what we should judge him on, not the failings of commanders under him or not knowing when to replace certain commanders as a non-military man. 

His general strategy which was to blockade the South, divide it in half along the Mississippi, emancipate slaves in the South, focus on capturing Richmond to decapitate the Confederacy and draw valuable resources to its defense, and win diplomatically by keeping Britain and France out of the war, worked as well as any plan likely would have."
26106,It's hard to imagine he could've done much worse than Johnson.
26107,"Well, my understanding was that both sides thought the war would be short because it would just be jockeying for position at the negotiating table, but neither side ended up accepting the other's positions. McClellan was known to be against the war (ran on a pacifist platform in the next election) so it seems less unreasonable that Lincoln took time to replace him, as McClellan was judicious with human lives. 

And regarding the reconstruction... Seeing as how we had almost no reconstruction I think Lincolns compromise would have been much better. By not giving too much too suddenly to black people perhaps we could have avoided the **extreme** violence and oppression from about 1900-1955"
26108,"Harry S Truman, the guy who everyone declared dead in the water in 1948 who not only proved the pundits wrong by winning, but led his party to recapturing both houses of congress by branding congress the 'Do Nothing' congress."
26109,"Also a shrewd Commander in Chief--making the decision to drop the bomb on Japan but ignoring pressure from his top generals to drop the bomb on China.

Furthermore, he stood up for what he believed in the face of overwhelming opposition. He vetoed Taft-Hartley which was so popular among Congress that they overrode his veto. He also desegregated the armed forces way before the height of the civil rights movement. Truly an underappreciated leader."
26110,And he forced the armed services to be racially integrated which was wildly unpopular with the military and public at the time.  One of the many steps leading to the civil rights act decades later.
26111,I love Teddy Roosevelt just for the folklore around him and his life. And we could probably use a little more trust-busting these days...
26112,"Same!

He was incredibly forward-thinking in his time. Thank him every time you visit a national park. And if you love mountain biking check out the 100 miles of trail laid out roughly between the north and south units of the park that bears his name in western ND.

I did that thing in three days with two friends of mine hauling our camping gear. On the second day around 3 p.m. we found ourselves riding next to his very own Elkhorn Ranch. The cattle in the area must have been thick when it was muddy because the trail was hellishly rough with hoof prints. We could barely keep our speed above 4mph on flat ground. It was as though Teddy's ghost was looking down on us and making us work harder just for our own good.

Bully!"
26113,"Dwight D. Eisenhower, as a policy wonk, everything he did was pleasing.

1. Sponsored and signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which created the interstate highway system. It is, in my opinion, one of the single most efficient government projects in moderns times in terms of benefits gained vs. costs.

2. Sponsored and Signed the Civil Rights Bill of 1957, the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction (undermined by congress).

3. Balanced the budget by refusing to cut taxes and raise defense spending, in a time when there was immense pressure to do otherwise.

4. Ended the Korean War by negotiating with China. Controlled Cold War crises in Korea, Vietname, Formosa, Suez, Hungary, Berlin, and Russia"
26114,Big liberal einsenhower fan. No lib can read his biography and not be impressed. He also resisted the Hawks in his admin for 8 years.
26115,"While it certainly was beneficial to many, the highway system *did* have its drawbacks. Highways devastated inner cities, often cleaving neighborhoods in half, lowering property values, which would later be occupied by the poorest citizens. In addition, those that could afford to leave the city did, increasing the concentration of poverty.

Many of the slums and ghettos today were caused by the highway system."
26116,"The original conception of the interstate highway system anticipated a true 'interstate' not inner-city set of roads. But local planners, when they got hold of it, had no qualms about blasting through the neighborhoods of the 'undesirables.'"
26117,It also effectively subsidizes trucking companies that are relatively fuel inefficient in competition with freight rail companies that are relatively fuel efficient.
26118,"Whats a ""policy wonk""?"
26119,"Someone who is extremely savvy and knowledgeable on policy and policy-making. To the point of being a ""geek"" about it. Examples would be HRC on the left and Paul Ryan on the right."
26120,"Has Paul Ryan ever proven that self proclaimed title? To me, proposing trickle down economics as a sound budget strategy immediately discredits any claim to seriousness in policy craft."
26121,"Yeah, a giant part of Ryan's budget proposal last election season was ""trust me, I have plans"". Yet said plans were never made public."
26122,"Someone who goes into the technical details of policy. So not ""we're going to bring jobs back"", but ""we're going to strategically invest in X while funding retraining program Y, which our best analysis says should increase employment among the chronically unemployed by Z%"""
26123,Anthony Wiener pre-penisgate. Watching him go off on the GOP in the house was incredibly satisfying.
26124,Wiener will always be my biggest disappointment in a candidate. He could have been a liberal firebrand but he had to live up to his name. You should check out the documentary that just came out about him. It's amazing the sort of access he gave.
26125,His comments right now on Trump and his supporters are just amazing. Someone asked him about Trump TV and he said that it would give his supporters something to watch while they brushed their 1 tooth. He also said that it's clear there is 30% of this country that shouldn't be allowed to run anything.
26126,"That doesn't sound ""amazing"" to me. That is no different than tea partiers calling Obama supporters welfare Queens."
26127,"Yeah Anthony Weiner isn't really someone I would rank as a top politician. It's very satisfying one you're on the left to hear someone in the top position say the same kind of stuff that you read on your favorite blogs, but was Anthony Weiner ever going to rally a bunch of congressmen to pass meaningful legislation?"
26128,Dude derailed such a promising career with Carlos Danger.  He was going to be the anointed successor of the Clintons.
26129,"Clement Attlee. 

Post world war 2 beat Churchill for the office of PM and, amongst other things, founded the NAtional Health Service, which has provided nationalised healthcare to the uk ever since. 

No other organisation have ever come as close to the hearts of the British people as the NHS, nor has any organisation changed as many lives."
26131,"This is my choice too which is an odd one considering that most of us can't name anything noteworthy he did and he was really soft-spoken, not a fiery orator. He just radiated a trustworthiness that's rare in politicians. A sort of Pope Francis aura. Of course there was the sympathy over his brother's assassination and he captured the ""hope and change"" sentiment of the times without any of the disappointment that could have followed."
26132,His speech after the MLK assassination is probably his most iconic moment.
26133,"That speech is amazing but so is his speech the next day usually referred to as ""the mindless menace of violence"" speech. That and his speech to South Africa is good."
26134,The South African speech is my favorite of his.
26135,"And what is funny is that he was the most pugnacious of the Kennedys in private.  Apparently, his brothers, who were more physically imposing than he would bully him growing up."
26136,"He wrote I think two books, though the latter was most likely heavily ghostwritten but has a lot about what he'd like in terms of policy. I'm a huge rfk fan, wish there were more resources on him."
26137,god I'm so sad he never got the chance to be President
26138,"I honestly believe that the assassination of Bobby Kennedy is the most momentous political event in the latter half of the 20th century. If he'd managed to win in 1968, I don't know what the country and our politics would look like, but they'd undoubtedly be very different.

Edit: yes, in the context of US politics, not the whole damn world."
26139,The fact that he spoke for 5 minutes and for that alone kept Indianapolis from rioting when MLK was assassinated says all that needs to be said about him. Only major city to not do so I think. His death is my biggest realistic what if to American history.
26140,Maybe in American politics.  Globally I'd lean on Mao's death and the rise of Deng Xiaoping.  His policies helped ~300m Chinese rise out of poverty and helped China go from a second rate communist power to the second most important country on the planet.
26141,i came here to say deng xiaoping! followed by lyndon johnson
26142,"I know, it's just so damn depressing.

I love Bobby and JFK, and Bobby was just such a great person and would have helped America heal so much in the light of so much crap going on."
26144,The difference between him and Nixon could not have been more drastic. Such a tragic loss.
26145,"I'm young. Can anyone fill me in on why he was assassinated? 

(I'll likely read up after work, but would appreciate a discussion here until then)"
26146,"Bobby had visited Israel/Palestine earlier in his life, and had become very moved by the trip.  He had become very pro-Israel, and that bothered the perpetrator who was a Palestinian anti-zionist.

In his journal entry, dated May 19th, the assassinator wrote:

>""My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession. RFK must die. RFK must be killed. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated..... Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68."""
26147,"Just fyi, the word is assassin, not assassinator"
26150,"Bobby Kennedy is my hero.  He inspired me to go to law school, even though he died a quarter century before I was born."
26151,"Well, In a way it might be a slightly good thing because then he would be defined by his record and not his iconic thoughtfulness and meekness which is why so many admire him."
26152,Who did it say?
26153,Bobby Kennedy.
26154,I'm going to guess Robert Kennedy.
26155,"David Lloyd George. Won a world war, and helped get Britain out of the 19th century, economically and socially. Of course, his party disintegrated beneath his feet, but no Prime Minister ever gets a happy ending."
26156,"The more I study UK politics, the more I'm beginning to realize that your last statement is true. Thatcher, Blair, Brown, Cameron, etc. Does any PM leave in a good position?"
26157,"Stanley Baldwin did. But that was a while ago.

Cameron got forced out due to Brexit.

Brown lost an election.

Blair sold his soul to George Bush, and is now watching his legacy burn as a result.

Major lost an election.

Thatcher got effectively deposed.

Callaghan was brought down by the Winter of Discontent.

Wilson was slowly losing his mind due to Alzheimer's.

Heath lost an election.

Douglas-Home lost an election.

Scandal forced Macmillan to step down.

The Suez crisis was Eden's undoing.

Then Churchill resigned a old and broken man.

Attlee lost an election.

Churchill lost an election.

Misjudging Hitler cost Chamberlain his job.

And then we're at Baldwin, a happy ending at last. (Although appeasing the Germans has caused his legacy to be picked to pieces)

Nobody walks out of 10 Downing Street because they want to."
26158,Thanks for the thorough response. It stretches further back than I ever could've imagined.
26159,"It's the nature of the system, no term limits means that politicians just go on until they get stabbed in the back (as happened to Blair and Thatcher, and would have happened to Cameron).

Cameron came pretty close, if he'd won the referendum he would have retired next year and handed over to George Osborne."
26160,Churchill?
26161,"I think even Churchill was only considered a good ""wartime"" PM. He wasn't suited for peacetime, according to some."
26162,Well when you don't actually have to leave at any point it that would seem to make it both more likely you would leave only when you had to... and encourage attempts to make that happen because people can't just wait it out.
26163,"Also passed the People's Budget as Chancellor, the first to explicitly redistribute wealth, and played a role in the Parliament Act 1911 which curtailed the power of the House of Lords.

Interestingly, he remains the only PM to not speak English as his first language (he spoke Welsh)."
26164,Russ Feingold.
26165,"Other than maybe Paul Wellstone, he is probably my favorite politician in my lifetime."
26166,Love Wellstone too but Russ voted against DOMA.
26167,Him and La Follette. Wisconsin's produced some great progressives (and some terrible conservatives).
26168,"For me it's between Huey Long and Joe Biden. I like Long because he is such an interesting character and he dominated Louisiana politics in such a way that hasn't been seen since. Biden because behind all the gaffes and goofiness, he's a damn solid politician who has done some real good."
26169,"For those interested, [Huey Long speaking in 1934](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hphgHi6FD8k), and [Sean Penn speaking as Long in *All The King's Men*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcmeV83K02E)"
26170,"Additionally, although it's quite long, I highly recommend T. Harry Williams' biography of him. It's a seminal biography."
26171,"I'm going to go very unconventional and pick **Robert Byrd**. (Hes the guy in that ""kkk member kissing Clinton"" meme that people post without understanding the history.) My choice is not for his policies, or overall impact, but because of the life he lived. He's a great example of someone who started out with a very sheltered and ignorant view of the world and through reasoning, a willingness to listen, and the courage to self-reflect transformed from a KKK member into someone the NAACP regarded as a ""great loss"" upon his death. 

It's worth reading at the very least the Wkiipedia entry if you don't know all that much about him, [especially the part concerning his views on race.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd#Race)

I think his life story would make for a great movie, specifically if what was a Sorkin-style look at the time when his grandson died and how that made him change his world view, maybe with flashbacks to segments of his earlier life choices."
26172,"Wonderful choice!

I think about his statements on his past sometimes when I'm depressed about race relations in this country. He's proof positive that people can change for the better."
26173,Yet some think it's somehow damning that he was friends with Hillary Clinton. Sad!
26174,"Probably just because of some of the things he said in the past, before he disavowed the KKK."
26175,"Fun little anecdote about Bryd, from when I was interning in Congress about 8 years ago.

He was very old at the time and had fairly poor eyesight. He still liked to go out to the floor in his wheelchair though and give speeches, so he would get an aid to print out his speeches on paper with massive font, we are talking about around 2 sentences a page. He would then proceed to sit with a giant stack of paper and go through his speech.

He also had a special wheel-chair accessible phone booth installed for him in the Democratic whip room.

He was an incredibly respected guy."
26176,"One thing I find really interesting about Byrd is him steering a lot of federal funds towards West Virginia. I lean right politically and don't like that. But at the same time, if I was from West Virginia, and my senator was fighting to make my state better in Congress like that especially considering it's a small state, I would LOVE him. So really, I respect that Byrd loved his state and would do anything for it."
26177,"I'm from West Virginia, and there is a reason you can't spit without hitting something named after him. I don't know how to feel about the ways he got money to the state, but I honestly can't imagine what my home state would look like without his influence."
26178,"I've gotta go FDR. He guided the US through some of its darkest hours and his influence is still felt by Americans everyday. Granted, he did some shitty things, but his accomplishments were many and his political skills fascinate me. He also gave us Eleanor Roosevelt as First Lady, so bonus points for that. 

In my own lifetime it is easily Obama. He was the first politician I volunteered for, and the first to whom I made a financial contribution, so there's a sentimental factor for me. He's also eloquent, [legitimate] scandal free, and someone I've been proud to have represent us on the international stage. I particularly enjoy his sardonic sense of humor."
26179,"Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr.  From the [1948 Convention Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwIdIUVFm4) to being a good soldier as VP under Johnson, Humphrey was well spoken, fighting for the cause as he knew how, and loyal to a fault."

26182,"This is one really hard, not sure where to go here.

It'd have to be either Steve Beshear (D, fmr Governor of Kentucky) or Hal Rodgers (R, US Rep of Kentucky).  

Beshear was a great governor, loved by most of the state.  Expanded medicaid, had pretty much the best exchange in the country.  Would work with both sides of the aisle (which is a far cry from what we got now).

Hal Rodgers is (I think) the longest serving member in the House of Reps.  He was just elected to his 18th term.  He was chairman of the House Appropriations committee not sure if he still is.  Anyway, he really brings the pork back home.  He's really pushing to find solutions to the opioid.  problem, which hits hard in his region. The only thing I really don't like about him is he LOVES to name everything after himself."
26183,5th longest serving
26184,Longest serving member from Kentucky I believe
26185,"I can't name a favorite (not well versed enough to know many past politicians), but I know William Weld, the current Libertarian VP, really interests me in that he actually went to the Republican convention in 1996 and tried to bring a more socially liberal aspect to the party. I really respect him for trying. He's the kind of republican I would consider voting for, especially with his success in Massachusetts."

26189,"Eugene Debs, an incredibly influential figure in the American left and labour history. He ran for president from a prison cell, as his defiant labour activism often had put him in odds with the state. 

Frederick Douglas, arguably the most influential black s statesman, long preceding MILK and other prominent black rights activist. He was a strong early proponent of black, women, and immigrant rights.

As a Canadian, I have to say Tommy Douglas. Socialist politician and hugely influential labour activist who brought forth our national healthcare service."
26190,"Barack Obama, whose campaign was the real political revolution."
26191,"It's a generational thing (I'm only 31), but Obama was the first presidential candidate where I would just pull my car over and listen to his speeches.  He basically said all the thing's I'd want a president to say, the way I'd want a president to say them.  There's valid reasons for the right to dislike him for Obamacare, and for the left to dislike him for failures on immigration reform and dismantling Bush-era defense policies, but I think history will remember him fondly as an empathetic, careful speaker in a time of polarization and outrage.

Also, unrelated - I've got a decent Hobbes tattoo and a deep love of Watterson :)"
26192,Obama is one of the best American speech makers ever. Easily the best in my lifetime.
26193,"I don't think it's fair to attribute the lack of immigration reform to Obama's failing, Congress has been completely deadlocked and unwilling to put anything forward."

26198,"René Levesque. He started a brand of nationalism that was almost entirely civic in nature with no ""race identity"".

The people of Québec carry his legacy in some form or another in the way they conceive their nation. Liberal, secular and pluralist.

I also think he was a very moral and honest politician, without all the dirty playing. He was a surprisingly sporty loser in the 1980 referendum and worked to make Québec a better place inside Canada after his loss. He had his heart and his ideas in the right place and he really marked a departure from the old status of Québec as some sort of ""ireland of the americas"" (catholic, conservative and under the thumb of a larger overlord).

He laid the seeds of what would become a distinct nation within a united Canada."
26199,"Former Prime Minister on New Zealand Helen Clark. She pushed through Civil Unions, legalised prostitution, created the New Zealand super fund and Kiwisaver, got a Free Trade deal with China (along with Brunei, Chile, Singapore, and Thailand), started the TPP,  got rid of fighter pilots from the Air Force, made student loans interest free, unbundled the local loop for phone lines, cut child poverty, and reunited Labour with the left after the Lange government insanity while maintaining fiscal logic.

I really hope that she becomes UN Secretary General (even though I know that probably won't happen)"
26200,"Dwight Eisenhower, Robert Taft, Bobby Kennedy.

It's hard not to like Reagan, but he's a unique/peculiar case and hardly a conventional statesman.

Jimmy Carter. One of my role models. A truly great man and a truly great person.

Ron Paul. I have a sentimental affection for the man as he was responsible for upending the way I looked at the world, though I later moved on. An honest man. Complicated; deep. An intriguing figure. Enigmatic despite his openness."
26201,Lee Kuan Yew.  Took a country from poverty to excellence.
26202,"Nelson Mandela.  He wasn't perfect, far from it.  But I think he recognized that just as he was imperfect, other people were too.  You can't live in a world of absolutes, where good guys win and bad guys lose, because in politics, everyone is a bad guy to someone, and most are a good guy to someone else.  He was a realist in that he would work with what he had, and an idealist because no one believed what he wanted was possible."

26210,Cato was overly conservative and probably lead to Caesar's Civil War.  Cicero was the real hero in the whole thing.  Political moderate and orator extraordinaire that tried to save the Republic.  A pragmatist and enemy of Mark Antony.
26211,"Sulla was the real hero. He didn't do enough, however. He always regretted not having Caesar put to death."
26212,"Wow. There are many things you could call Sulla... not sure ""hero"" is one of them though."
26213,"He willingly gave up the dictatorship after doing what he thought would save the Republic from destruction. Sure his methods were... unsound... but it was a desperate effort. He proscribed the wrong people. Had Caesar not been spared, the Republic might had been sustained."
26214,Did you also just read Robert Harris' Cicero trilogy?
26215,"Cato the younger? A fool that allowed his principles lead to him being manipulated by Cæsar? I suppose I can see the appeal in him, but I can not shake the feeling that he managed to play himself one to many times, just because he wanted to be holier-than-thou among all the senators. 

Cicero was a great politician though, had some flaws. But his influence even today is rather great. Atleast if you practice law."
26216,"Cato the Younger was actually a pretty emo dude for the time. He'd never wear a ""fashionable"" toga, only the ""toga pulla"", which was a deep purple or black. It symbolized his mourning for the foundationary principles on which the Republican was built. He would be a strict Constitutionalist in modern America."
26217,"The man killed himself by ripping his own bowels out, now that's hardcore."
26218,"Not only that, he failed the first time, a doctor stitched up his wound, and when he was left alone, he re-opened the wound and tore his bowels out *again*. All because he didn't want Julius Caesar to be the one to kill him."
26219,Cato the Elder has to be my favorite Cato. Carthago delenda est!
26220,"Dick Nixon was a goddamn masterpiece. He didn't even have to have Congress on his side to be in absolute command. This may be a tired cliché by now, but he deserved to go down for something better than a stupid burglary."
26221,Like that time he committed treason in 1968. He should've gone down over that instead.
26222,"Meh. ""Treason"" is overselling it. He did something unsightly that wouldn't play well with the electorate, but the Logan Act is unenforceable and unconstitutional and there's no way he would have gone down for merely talking to a foreign leader. By that logic Tom Cotton would be in jail for his letter to Iran. He definitely could have lost the election."
26223,"There's an argument that Cotton violated the Logan Act, but even then, I think there's a pretty well-defined line between an open letter of dissent opposing a foreign policy decision from elected members of the US government and a private citizen in direct communication with a foreign head of state directly undermining the US negotiation of a ceasefire to an active war."
26224,The distinction between public vs. private correspondence is not mentioned in the Logan Act.
26225,"You should read ""Being Nixon: A Man Divided"". It's an incredible biography that succeeds in studying both the good and the bad about the man."
26226,"It's probably not the cool answer, but yeah, Hillary Clinton. As a young liberal, I'm thrilled that I'm living in an era where a woman has a real chance of becoming the president, especially one as progressive and as strong as she. May many more women presidents follow her."
26227,"Love her grit, toughness, and determination. Her public service is to be really admired. She's really accomplished a lot and it's clear that every single step of the way has been an uphill battle, yet she forges on."
26229,"I just got finished with ""A Man Divided"". I'm gonna have to agree with you. He was an exceptional politician. He was an introvert who dominated a business full of extraverts."

So for me, I'd have to say Michael Bloomberg. He owed nothing to anybody. He did and said what he truly believed would keep New York as the best city in the world, and he succeeded. I didn't always agree with him, but I respected the hell out of him. Not once in his 12 years as mayor did I ever think to myself that he was pandering to anyone, attempting to score political favors, or angling for an opportunity to make the story about him. I just wish every politician could be like that."
26232,"You'd love this interview with him:

> 
If I finish my term in office … and have high approval ratings, then I wasted my last years in office. That high approval rating means you don’t upset anybody. High approval rating means you’re skiing down the slope and you never fall. Well, you’re skiing the baby slope, for goodness’ sakes. Go to a steeper slope. You always want to press, and you want to tackle the issues that are unpopular, that nobody else will go after."
26233,"Well as a millenial I've only witnessed 3 presidents.  Obama, Bush, and Bill Clinton.  Any love for Bill Clinton or am I just having nostalgia?"
26234,"I'm a millennial but I love president Clinton. I hate that the further left in the party have tarnished him name a bit especially this last cycle. The reforms he got through weren't perfect but were great first steps for gay rights, he was a centrist who tried working with both sides while one side absolutely hated him but he still got a lot accomplished. It's easy to look back and critic or say it wasn't enough but I think considering the climate he did a pretty good job and built a strong coalition for the party to succeed for quite a while."
26235,Churchill overall. In the United States I'd go with James Madison or Abraham Lincoln
26236,"OP, if you liked Caro, I'd suggest his book ""The Power Broker"" on Robert Moses."
26237,"FDR - Not his policies I just admire his story. I read an excellent book, The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope by Alter, and the character that was FDR is fascinating."
26238,"**FDR**    
He began his career in public service after flunking out of Columbia Law School. He then decided to run for governor of New York. He eventually turned America into a superpower and was elected to 4 terms. He was so devoted that the strain of leading the nation through a world war eventually killed him, although his legacy will never die."
26239,It always makes me sad that he could not live to see the end of the war it was fairly obvious the allies would win but it would have been nice for him to see the people celebrating after all the hard years of work he put into the effort.
26240,"Theodore Roosevelt. 

Despite being staunchly imperialistic, he did a lot of great things for America as a politician, chiefly fighting political and corporate corruption. Even from his days as a police commissioner in the NYPD and stopping crooked/lazy cops. Under his tenure, unions received their first official recognition, and from there on strengthened union movements. His conservationist policies ensured huge amounts of America were protected even today for tourism. Internationally he brokered peace between Japan and Russia and got the Panama Canal built.

His presidency was a huge list of domestic and international successes. And beyond that he was a very eloquent speaker and fitness enthusiast. A very good role model."
26241,"Henry A Wallace, a progressive champion who was FDR's third-term VP and was almost president himself had he not lost the spot to Truman for the 4th term. He was pro-New Deal, wanted to end segregation in the 40s, was a spiritualist and theosophist, a controversial Ag secretary during the dust bowl, and someone who wanted to head off the cold war by normalizing relations with the USSR."
26242,"The great 19th century Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell, perhaps the most competent proponent of Irish Home Rule. Parnell held the balance of power between the Liberals and the Conservatives and pushed through his vision of Irish independence.

Gladstone described him as: ""I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon."" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says, ""More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation."""
26243,"Reddit has made it suck to say this, but Theodore Roosevelt. I always then have to add the qualifier that I am a Roosevelt Scholar, wrote my undergraduate thesis about him, collect first editions of his books, etc. He's such a well known President, but very few people really understand how astute, well-reasoned, and effective he was as a politician."

26245,FDR. Few Presidents have held both his commitment to the public good AND the Machiavellian cynicism required to navigate the global political landscape as he did.
26246,Definitely the President most responsible in moving the US to a superpower. Min wage and social security were great to.
26247,And the TVA and WPA.
26248,"Harry-ass Truman. The guy damn well created the post Cold War geopolitical situation. All other presidents just worked off the framework he established with the Berlin Airlift, NATO, Korea and the Marshall Plan."
26249,"Carter and probably FDR. Also basically the muckrakers from the guilded age. 

Both politicans attempted the impossible (FDR in his attempt to fix great depression era america and Carter trying to fix the middle east) and both should be given marks for their determination."
26250,George Washington. Guy got offered the United States multiple times and turned it down.
26251,"Abraham Lincoln, he was one of the least experienced to win and became the most consequential president"
26252,Heuy P. Long of Louisiana. To be so openly corrupt and yet so widely regarded as a generally okay guy is amazing.
26253,Russell Feingold.

26255,"From the founders days, Aaron Burr and Hamilton - even though they dueled, they were very interesting characters; more so than the planter-slave aristocrats or the New England puritans.  Plus Gore Vidal's book Burr, while fiction, is a lot of fun following a scoundrel."
26256,"Someone who hasn't been mentioned that I think was critical was Henry Clay. He stepped up consistently when the country needed him, worked to get both sides to the table and calm crisis. He was a very bright guy, knew how to negotiate, and had some more progressive ideas. Though he owned slaves he wanted to move toward emancipation, he believed in the rights of Native Americans to their lands, he supported independence for many Latin American nations, and he tried his best to avoid war, supporting national interests to keep the nation together"
26257,Julius Caesar seems to have been pretty impressive. Forgiving your enemies to have them in your debt was a level of political calculation that the Romans hadn't had for a long time.
26258,"Justinian I. From a peasant family, rose to lead an empire in decline and create the first system of unified laws against overwhelming odds.

For the modern era, Ataturk, Lee Kuan Yew, Mandela."
26259,"Unconventional answer but mine is Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. Talleyrand was like a real life Littlefinger, always 2 steps ahead of everyone else and always ending up on the winning side."
26260,"I recently started that book. Goddamn, LBJ sounds like the most horrible teenager ever!"
26261,"Barry Goldwater.  I have a thing for people who aren't afraid to speak the truth when the truth is not popular or acceptable.  Goldwater held firm to his conservative ideals in a time where conservatism was in exile, and the result of his being the political face of the conservative movement (and taking an absolute shellacking in his presidential bid) was a conservative movement that's been strong for the last 30+ years. 

In the same vein, I've become appreciative of Calvin Coolidge in recent years, especially following the biography released about him a few years back.  He saw the Depression coming, he understood the problems that would be faced, and he did a great job as president when necessary.  I don't know if we'll see another president like him, frankly."
26262,"I don't love Goldwater, but I do respect his views on the separation of Church & State:
>There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both."
26263,"One of the things I like about Goldwater is that he became a libertarian as time went on. It wasn't until late in his life that his support for abortion came out, as well as supporting gay rights. He absolutely loathed the religious right and warned that they were going to hijack the GOP.

It's pretty sad that ""Mr. Conservative"" today would be relentlessly ridiculed for not being conservative enough."
26264,"Are you saying his opposition to the Civil Right Act was 'speaking the truth'? It's true he didn't hide his racism, but I wouldn't call that an admirable quality."
26265,Didn't he found the Arizona chapter of the NAACP?
26266,"He supported every anti-discrimination bill that applies to government. He opposed Title II of the Civil Rights Act which applied to private businesses. That is the standard libertarian position which, while I disagree with, isn't necessarily racist.

[Typo]"
26267,Of course it's racist. It's racism under the veil of freedom of association. One person's rights end when they infringe on another's rights. It's like not allowing African Americans to not eat in your private establishment restaurant.
26268,"No. It certainly can be borne out of racism, but don't try to tell me that all people who are libertarian on this issue are racists."
26269,"They're promoting a system where a majority can force a minority to be second-class citizens, so they're engaging in systematic racism, which is a more difficult concept to work with, and doesn't even require that everyone involved in it be a ""racist."""
26270,"You're right, they are making a racist system possible, but (for some) their belief that people have the liberty to choose who they do business with for whatever reason they want outweighs their views on the rights of people to not be discriminated against. You probably could argue they're being racist by omission, but I don't think they're openly racist. Rand Paul doesn't strike me as racist. He strikes me as anti-authority, and that includes the unfortunate side of that coin.

I obviously don't agree with the position but I can understand where it comes from without it being racism (or bigotry in general)."
26271,"> hey're promoting a system where a majority can force a minority to be second-class citizens, so they're engaging in systematic racism, which is a more difficult concept to work with, and doesn't even require that everyone involved in it be a ""racist.

No, Goldwater was against forcing people to discriminate as much as forcing people to not discriminate.


Goldwater believed it was the personal choice of private businesses to discriminate. Jim Crow forced people to discriminate. Goldwater believed people should have the liberty to choose who they want to hire, who they want to marry, etc.  


Its not racism. It allows for racism, but Liberty is the ability to choose how to live ones life the way they see fit."
26272,"What kind of liberty does a minority group have when an antagonistic majority takes away their ability to, oh, shop, and buy property, and get jobs?

I think that individual liberty is really easy to understand ""I can do what I want when I want to whomever I want to, and that's freedom.""  It takes out all the other variables and makes for easy comparisons of ""this guy is allowed to do whatever this guy is allowed to do.""

But I feel like it completely ignores context and reality.  At various times the group of philosophers who founded the United States thought that life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness should be guaranteed rights.  When equal access to those things is taken away from groups by groups, I think a worse affront to liberty has been done than making a shop sell equally to everyone."
26273,"That's not an affront to liberty. That's an affront to decency, which is very different. You happen to have a lower threshold for indecency based on race than some others but still others would consider your position racist. Do you support allowing the KKK to meet, march, or publish? Do you think their right to do so is more important than the right of minorities to live without hated directed towards them? 

We can all agree on what's immoral behavior but disagreeing over what to outlaw doesn't then make some racist."
26274,">  When equal access to those things is taken away from groups by groups, I think a worse affront to liberty has been done than making a shop sell equally to everyone.

Im not disagreeing with you.



However, just because others do doesnt mean you should call them racists or insult them. Just say you disagree with their position. Libertarians disagree that people should be forced to sell to people who they dont want to sell to. Its not racist. You can respectfully disagree all you want, but its a legitimate political difference."
26275,"""Racist"" isn't a dirty word. We're all racist, just at different points on the spectrum. Acknowledging the limits of your understanding isn't a bad thing."
26276,"Well, and I do try to be respectful at all, but if I say that those people are doing something racist am I calling them racists?  And does ""racist"" have to be boiled down to just an insult?  It's not like I'm just calling people assholes."
26277,"I'm not saying I agree with Goldwater on the whole Civil Rights thing, but he felt segregation was a state issue and shouldn't be a federal policy. I don't think he meant to be racist in general (especially since he voted for the 1957 and 1960 Civil Rights Acts), but it seemed racist to most people at the time. Heck, Johnson used it to brand him as a racist."
26278,"Have you ever noticed how people arguing things ""ought to be up to the states"" are only ever making that argument about things they don't want to happen but look like they're going to anyway?"
26279,"Yes.  Goldwater was not a racist, and in fact had a strong desegregation record on a whole.  The claim of Goldwater as a racist has no basis in fact."
26280,Winston Churchill was easily the most quotable.
26281,"Ron Paul, Thomas Jefferson"
26282,Jack Kennedy. Saved the world. Boned Marilyn Monroe. Made me see the stars.
26283,"Slightly off the beaten path: Bob Bullock, former Lieutenant Governor of the State of Texas.

Reworked/modernized collection of tax revenue as state comptroller, overhauled ethics laws in the legislature...was the biggest reason that W's term as governor was the height of bipartisanship in the state.

He's also basically the only reason that Texas Tech and Baylor went to the Big XII and weren't left in the cold when the Southwest Conference broke up (which mattered, and matters)."
26284,Abe Lincoln. He lives up to the hype.
26285,Fidel Castro or Salvador Allende.
26286,"Great list!

26287,"Thanks,

I didn't include /r/RPA at first because I excluded subreddits that haven't been active in the last month, but I guess this is going to be a list that needs some flexibility, so I added it. I already had /r/USpolitics, but missed /r/politics_new, thanks for that.

I also added the candidates subreddits, thanks for the suggestion, even though they are very small and this list will be very tough to maintain if it includes every subreddit with 1 subscriber and only a few posts, but seeing as the campaigns are just getting underway I'll try to keep the very small ones for candidates maintained. 

Any help would be appreciated.

I should also add for others reading this, that I used [RedditList](http://redditlist.com/dir/1898/Politics), as well as the other lists (and some legwork) and most of the categories are sorted by number of subscribers, but there are bound to be mistakes, so if anyone notices any just give me a heads up."
26288,"It's small and not very active: [/r/CalPolitics](/r/CalPolitics).

Slightly large and slightly more active: [/r/wisconsinpolitics](/r/wisconsinpolitics) and [/r/arizonapolitics/](/r/arizonapolitics/).

There are probably other state politics reddits, but those are the only ones that I know about."
26289,"If Mens Rights is in Activism and Reform, White Rights should be too. There's a lot more to White Rights than the KKK."
26290,"Well, I added it but it might be the wrong category,  I'm pretty sure it's not the only misplaced one. I don't really understand that stuff, so I don't know what their intention is. When I first saw it I thought it was a troll subreddit."
