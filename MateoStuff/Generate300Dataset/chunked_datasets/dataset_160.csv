51640,Saddle Leather with a Midnight Green Pro
51641,Peel clear case to show off the midnight green
51642,Probably going with a clear case. Have apple care so depending how slippery it is with the new back I might go caseless.
51643,That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at.
51644,"I always get the black Apple leather but I‚Äôm thinking of going with the Saddle Brown this year.

The black is great because it holds up really well over time. I love the look of the Saddle Brown but I‚Äôve been hesitant to get it because I‚Äôm worried it might look like crap after a while.

Anyone own one? How does Saddle Brown stand up after a year?"
51645,"I ordered a Ringke Onyx case for my 11. I really like it, I  guess it‚Äôs a bit hard to judge without a phone in it but it squares off the sides a bit and seems comfortable. 

iPhone 11 seems like a great size though. Excited for my mint green!!"
51646,"I went with the clear case because I liked the color of the midnight green and want to be able to see it. 

https://i.imgur.com/Wo6flIc.jpg"
51647,Definitely a Caudabe case. Either the Sheath or Lucid Clear. Caudabe makes hands down the best cases I‚Äôve seen so far if you want slim and protection.
51648,"I ordered the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Style Series Case for everyday office use and the Eonfine Designed for iPhone 11 Pro Case, Shockproof Full-Body Heavy Duty Protection with Built-in Screen Protector for my upcoming trip to Mexico. We'll see how it works out, I've used the Supcase brand before on my iphone 7Plus and iphone X (current)."
51649,Does anyone make a decent case for the 11 pro with a credit card slot on the back?
51650,Think i‚Äôm gunna rock this one nakeddd
51651,Mous always. Screen just refuses to crack with their cases.
51652,I bought a rhinoshield modular case for iphone 11. I had a standard rhinoshield case on my Iphone 7 and dropped that so many times and it still looks brand new and works just fine.
51653,"Clear, not getting some weird green color to cover it up."
51654,already have my beloved [TORRAS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07VW7QTW8?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) case here with me waiting for the actual phone to arrive on Friday. i‚Äôve been using the 7 case for a year and it‚Äôs perfect.
51655,"I'm not going to purchase a case for day to day use. I'll get one the battery case for on travel.

I wanna hold the iPhone bareback! üòÅ"
51656,"Pitaka

51657,"Leather Apple case in Saddle Brown with the Midnight Green Pro more than likely.

Gonna go to the store to see how it looks in pers9n to make sure once I get it though."
51658,"Speck clear presidio for my non-Pro green 11, thanks to Verizon‚Äôs discount. 

Also going to get Apple‚Äôs case and compare the two. Whichever one is better will be kept and the other returned."
51659,"Incipio Dual Pro, have used it for all my iPhones!"
51660,"Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear case. I have it on my iPhone X and love it for its decent protection, low bulkiness and reasonable price (I got mine off Amazon for under US$15)."
51661,Spigen Thin
51662,Spigen Liquid Crystal just like I did for iPhone X.
51663,I got this one to display the phone and apple leather case for other times
51664,I bought a Cyrill (speigen sister brand) silicone case from amazon for $9 CAD. Has anybody used one of these for another phone? Or have any idea how close it is to the Apple one?  If it is terrible I‚Äôll just get an Apple one.
51665,"Tech 21 clear case for the iPhone 11. Had it with my XR so I wanted the same for the 11.

Ordered it off Amazon yesterday should be here tomorrow along with  Spigen Tempered glass."
51666,I‚Äôll be waiting for Incipio to release the Octane for the Pro but I‚Äôll just find something cheap to use until then.
51668,"Spigen slim case with room for a magnet. 
With tougher glass, can now go slimmer on the case. 

After that, hard to beat the saddle leather case from Apple."
51669,"Ordered the official Apple clear case, tech 21 pure clear case, and official apple pine green silicone case. Have no idea which one to use lol"
51670,"One of the translucent cases from Amazon. I wanna show off my green phone, but also hate fingerprints and oily cases. Translucent case doesn't really show either, but still see-thru enough to show off color."
51671,Apple clear case for my silver pro max. The case should be here Tuesday. I ordered the case before I preordered my phone.
51672,using a Spigen Crystal Clear silicon case while waiting for Rhinoshields Mod NX to drop for the 11 series
51673,Pelican cases always. But my uncle works for the. So I‚Äôm biased.
51674,I never got to actually hold the black leather Apple one as I always go with saddle brown. Have you tried both? Can you tell me if the black feels the same as the saddle brown?
51675,Grabbed the Clementine Silicone for my 11 Pro Max. Showed up yesterday in the mail.
51676,"Careless the majority of the time, apple clear case when I want a little more protection."
51677,I‚Äôm on the hunt for a white leather case to match my Common Projects sneakers!
51678,"I got the forest green leather case for my 11 Pro, love the color and can‚Äôt wait to star using it!"
51679,"Normally I would do an Apple Leather Case, but they aren‚Äôt offered for the 11. Black silicone it is I guess!"
51680,UAG Pathfinder in olive drab.
51681,"Incipio NGP pure in blue, it‚Äôs kinda translucent/frosted so I think it‚Äôll look good on the silver phone too"
51682,"Will have the UAG Monarch case for the phone. Have one for my current phone and it never failed on me, even tossed it to the ground in front of my co-workers on purpose when they questioned the protection it provided and came out 100% fine. Thought about getting the official leather case, but the UAG case just offers great protection and is only $10 more than the leather case."
51683,"Has anyone used redpepper cases before?  I like the look of this. 
 I'm looking for a enclosed case with screen built in.

51684,"That‚Äôs a good protection for your new phone. No new phone for me, but I have been using Apple leather case since my 5S. Currently using 7 Plus and it‚Äôs on the Saddle Brown leather case"
51685,I got the clear Apple case for my iPhone 11!
51686,How thick is the Apple leather phone case?
51687,dat camera hole tho
51688,"Screen protector wise I always go for the Spigen EZ ones now with full coverage and the fancy installation tray.

Case I love the Apple leather but no bottom protection turns me off, I was looking at the Nomad leather"
51689,Otterbox commuter + zagg invisishield.
51690,"a quadlock. if you need to put it on a hadlebar or mirror of a motorbike, it‚Äôs perfect."
51691,"All of Mous‚Äôs YouTube advertising got to me - getting the Mous Limitless 3.0 (for IPhone 11 Pro).

This is my first iPhone.  I‚Äôve used OtterBox Commuters on all of my Androids but I‚Äôm tired of the two-piece system and wanted to try something new - hope I don‚Äôt regret it.  They‚Äôve protected my phones from a lot of falls and even an accidental throw of sorts."
51692,Saddle brown leather case.
51693,"Totallee cases are the best ones I ever used:
https://www.totalleecase.com"
51694,apple leather case in meyer lemon. apple cases have never failed me in terms of durability and quality and i'm hoping it will kind of match my sunflower apple watch classic buckle
51695,I bought the same case that‚Äôs in the photo for my i8+ and I‚Äôve been using it ever since! I love things that last
51696,"Apple clear case for the iPhone 11. On my 8 Plus I have a Spigen clear case I like a lot, except for the pretty prominent Spigen branding on the side."
51697,Apple black leather for my 11 Pro. Been rocking black leather since the 5s
51698,I‚Äôve ordered the Apple iPhone 11 Clear Case.  I‚Äôll probably pick up a leather option too
51699,Otterbox Defender Pro and nothing less. All my iPhones have had this case or a Defender. I won‚Äôt use anything else.
51700,"Otterbox, and alphaglass"
51701,Got the Aubergine for my Midnight Green 11 Pro Max. I think it‚Äôs a sick combo.
51702,"sadly i am disappointed with the original Apple cases. The black leather was feeling weird after some time and the Apple Silicon case was feeling fatty, even though it was clean.

Surprisingly my daily case is now from a souvenir shop in Kuala Lumpur, that was packaged like a Apple fake. No weird feeling, easy to clean and looking neat."
51703,Casetify!
51704,None! Gotta show off that Midnight Green!
51705,My favorite: PITAKA magcase aramid body armor
51706,Pitaka and I may pick up a Saddle Brown Apple Leather case. Those are the 2 I have been using for a few years now. Love them both.
51707,Alaskan Blue Silicon Apple case (11 Pro Max)
51708,"My black leather Apple case arrived yesterday. The debate for me is do Zagg invisashield at bestbuy, or Belkin at the Apple Store? I usually go Best Buy, but strongly considering Belkin from Apple any insight?"
51709,Have both the black and saddle brown apple leather case for my iPhone X. Black is classy but kinda boring. Love the saddle brown and the patina that comes with it over time. I once fell out in love with the saddle brown but kinda love it again. So will probably get just one case for my iPhone 11 pro - Saddle brown apple leather case.
51710,"Not sure what I‚Äôm gonna get. I kind of want to go without a case, but I have a 1 year old at home sooo..."
51711,"Same, but I have two kids."
51712,"I‚Äôm going to try symmetry with built in popsocket for a pro max. Popsocket is super useful for a large phone. I am worried the case is gonna be huge though. 

I generally used official leather cases in the past. But I think they are overpriced for what they provide - fairly bulky, poor protection on the bottom, and slippery.

Clear case has no appeal at all to me. Clear cases look terrible whenever I see them and look worse over time with dirt and marks. Dark case or leather is the best.

I went caseless on my XS for a long time until accidentally dropping and shattering the screen. I had apple care but it‚Äôs still a hassle and the replacement screen had some dust under the camera lens. These phones break so easily, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth going caseless as much as I love the naked phone."
51713,"I pre-ordered a loopy case for my 11 pro. Honestly the ergonomics of not actually having to hold my phone while being able to reach the far corners is not bullshit. I can practically fling it out the window at the drive through and never worry about dropping it. There are some disadvantages, this is obviously not the lowest profile or the best looking case you can get but the ergonomics trump everything for me after having used one for the past 3 years. 

https://www.loopycases.com"
51714,"I like the leather best. But pretty thick and if you don‚Äôt have a good care with it,gets ruined pretty quickly."
51715,"I'm buying an apple official silicon case and plan to return it when I find a better or good cheaper case. I like wallet cases, am currently using a wallet case on my 7+ that holds all of my identification and cards."
51716,I went with a totalle case this time. I prefer barely there cases. Would rather not detract from the way the phone looks
51717,No case. Helps me appreciate the phone more and take better care of it
51718,Spigen 100%. Apple's over priced cases look great but they are insanely expensive.
51719,Humixx ultraslim
51720,"UAG Monarch case, no other case even competes imo."
51721,Spigen Liquid Air
51722,"I‚Äôm getting the official leather folio in black.

Edit: clarification"
51723,"I'm going to get a [Nomad Rugged case](https://hellonomad.com/products/rugged-case-rustic-brown-iphone-11-pro-max) this year.

Nomad makes great looking cases, and they do not add too much bulk to the phone. 

Also, I'm going to install a [Zagg](https://www.zagg.com/) glass screen protector too."
51724,Pitaka squad checking in.
51725,Apple clear case and Alaskan Blue Silicone
51726,I bought the same black leather case a few days ago.  Looks nice!
51727,"I bought two for my new 11 Pro Max, the same ones that I have and love for my XS Max. The UAG Monarch in Red and a Rhinoshield Crashguard in Blue. I would easily recommend the monarch but it‚Äôs kind of expensive - about $65."
51728,"I bought the black one when I pre-ordered my phone, it was the only one they had in store and I didn‚Äôt want to chance them not having it when my phone arrives"
51729,Nice! I ordered this one the day the phone was announced because of the same fear
51730,"I currently have a spigen ultra hybrid, but I will pick up a midnight blue leather case when I get a chance to go out to the Apple store"
51732,Debating on getting a third party clear case or leather again...
51733,My go to case is the Caudabe Sheath. Also picked up their Lucid Clear as I like having a clear option every now and then. The Sheath will probably be on my phone 99% of the time though. Perfect case imo.
51734,"I‚Äôve always gotten an Apple leather case when I first get a new iPhone, then throughout the year I‚Äôll try other cases, but usually always return too the leather one.   Last year with my XS Max, I tried a clear case and love how it showed  off the phone itself. Unfortunately, they all yellowed.  I‚Äôm expected this year to try an Apple clear case which allegedly won‚Äôt yellow. We shall see.  Also I like that  Apple‚Äôs cases are open on the bottom. Without a home button, I like being able to see which ends is the top of the phone beside I pick it up."
51735,"ESR!

Grabbing clear from them to show that awesome midnight green üòÅ. 

The üçé clear is nice but I'm not a fan of the exposed bottom.

51736,"I bought a cheap $10 Spigen Liquid Crystal for my 11 Pro just to have a case when I get it, but I might wind up moving to a mous Limitless 3 or dbrand Grip."
51737,"I love the absolutely minimal cases like MNML. Since MNML are pretty pricey, [Tozo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W9LVZT3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) makes one just like it on Amazon for much cheaper. Now I just need my phone to get here..."
51738,I think if I get a second case it will be something like this. I did get apple care so I will most likely go case less from time to time.
51739,No battery case No upgrade!
51740,Going caseless. as always.
51741,wont it get a lot of micro-scratches from dirt and dust in your pockets?
51742,"you and my wife, have a problem."
51743,"Weird flex, but okay."
51744,Yeah all that and the one expensive case I was wondering about was the Saddleback Leather one haha.
51745,"The saddleback isn‚Äôt available for purchase yet. They just received their molds for the 12 series phones and should hopefully have some models released by late January 2021. I‚Äôm currently using the apple sleeve, but I‚Äôll be ordering a saddleback once they‚Äôre available."
51746,"Ah, good to know. Going to get one for my bosses new 12 pro when they come out cause he got the crappiest rigid thin plastic case I‚Äôve ever seen off Amazon."
51747,"https://saddlebackleather.com/boot-leather-iphone-case-iphone-12/

It‚Äôs available now. Just in case anyone is looking for it.

How does he like it? I‚Äôd love to see a picture of it after some time with it."
51748,"I‚Äôve only ever used one for an xs and it was amazing. I‚Äôd say the Saddleback leather iPhone cases are the top tier. The toughest and highest quality boot leather, and hand made by artisans the old school way. You will get TONS of compliments on it if you buy one. With how expensive they are though I‚Äôd honestly only buy if you plan on keeping that 12 for like 3+ years."
51749,"Did you end up ordering the saddleback case?

I‚Äôm curious what first-hand impressions are."
51750,Definitely weird. To make a whole post about cases just shows this dude has too much time.
51751,That‚Äôs not ‚Äúa little overboard ‚Äú
51752,"What a fun little road to go down.

My 12 Pro is in a Otterbox Defender I got for $20 on a Target sale.  It's my alternative to paying for AppleCare+ because I know I'll drop it maybe once a month."
51753,"I have an 11PM, but Otterbox Defender gang for life dude! people say that it makes the case a little bulky but I've honestly never noticed it."
51754,Oh I love holding the real phone for a while when I clean it.  I just wish it was safe that way.
51755,Idk how you don‚Äôt notice it haha. My 11 had the Defender and I felt like I could defend my self from intruders by using it as a weapon. It was huge.
51756,I guess I‚Äôve just always used thicker cases. I‚Äôm usually working at high heights or around heavy machinery
51757,"I liked the case a lot but yeah it was definitely noticeable, especially in my pocket. It‚Äôs the best ‚Äúmanual labor‚Äù case out there. I notice a ton of people in construction and those types of jobs usually have one"
51758,I just don‚Äôt use the belt attachment thing that comes with the case. *Those* people are truly psychopaths
51759,Haha. I tried to use that because it came with the case so I thought why not. It actually was annoying because it would constantly get caught on stuff so yeah....idk how people wear those.
51760,The newer defender feels more like a commuter with port covers.  Doesn't have the integrated screen protector anymore and edges are shorter.
51761,Tech21 Pure Clear lineup is my favorite iPhone cases. I have one on mine and then a black camo dbrand skin on the iPhone so it looks fuckin dope.
51762,I didnt know there is an entire cult on the Otterbox Defender series. I must admit Im a big fan of it though I have received a lot of flak about how bulky its made my iphone look. Glad to have found my brethren hahahaha
51763,Otterbox deffenders has to be the best protective case hands down. I have been using itterbox since 6 years on all my devices ! Worth it
51764,Spigen liquid hybrid cases... best bang for the buck
51765,"Thanks for all the info! My default is caseless + skin for added grip. I‚Äôm curious to see where MagSafe accessories go. I like the idea of a MagSafe car mount and charger down the road, so whatever case decision I make, needs to be compatible with that.

And to your point...yes...incredible case options over here in iPhone-land.

Thanks for your write up!"
51766,What skin do you use.
51767,"dbrand Black Matrix on a white 12 mini. I wanted more grip. Originally ordered the white skin, but it has a pretty cheap feel and I was very disappointed (first time ever I didn't like a dbrand skin, and I've been using them for years.) dbrand was awesome and sent a replacement for the cost of shipping. (I also have a metal plate on the back of the phone for my car mount...until I find the right Magsafe solution...so wanted to cover it up.)"
51768,The matrix skins are grippy?
51769,They are. And they look great. Have them on my 12 mini and 11‚Äù iPad Pro.
51770,Where do I get the skin from for grip?
51771,I‚Äôm a big fan of dbrand. High quality. Good service. Reasonable prices.
51772,Would you mind sharing a picture of you have it on u to our own phone?
51773,"https://imgur.com/a/RcaWqJW/

Here you go. The bump under the skin in the phone is the metal plate for my magnetic car mount. (And, yes, wireless charging works; I placed the plate low enough to not interfere with wireless charging, but still high enough to hold the phone straight and sturdy on the car mount.)"
51774,Awesome thanks. This looks fantastic. I gotta try this.
51775,Did ya get any magsafe case yet
51776,"I did. Noticed Apple‚Äôs leather case (in black only) for $23 on sale on Amazon, and grabbed it. So far so good, though I still don‚Äôt love using a case."
51777,"How tf for only 20 bucks, it‚Äòs 70 everywhere else. But do u know if I get a phone holder for the car that‚Äòs magsafe, will it be able to old a normal magnetic case for my XS?"
51778,"I see the MagSafe magnet patterns for sale, but don‚Äôt know how well they‚Äôll work. Maybe YouTube can answer it for you?"
51779,"I bought an [OtterBox Strada](https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/iphone-12-pro-max/77-65468.html).

It's fucking garbage. Stay far away from it. Cannot recommend this case for anyone.

Leather feels super cheap. The volume buttons are super difficult to press. The force required is absurd. The plastic has clear, sharp molding lines that makes it uncomfortable to hold. The leather edge is so sharp that my pinky hurts after 10 minutes of holding my phone one-handed."
51780,"Well done on your reviews.  I happened to randomly buy a Ringke Onyx from eBay when I ordered my iPhone 12 Pro for $8.99.  

It is hands down the best everyday phone case I‚Äôve ever had and I also highly recommend it."
51781,"I‚Äôm using the Apple silicone. I still can‚Äôt believe I spent $50 on a silicone case. I figured it would be higher quality than other brands, time will tell."
51782,"same, but its 70$ CAD. Had a hard time taping the Visa loll. But worth it imo."
51783,You get MagSafe I guess
51785,Took it back. Case kept falling off
51786,What else u got
51787,"The Apple Leather cases for the iPhone 12 series are shit, and I don't feel comfortable using them. 

They don't *snap* on with their lips like most cases do, and so they come off way, **way** too easily. 

Corners and edges of the phone push out with ease, meaning any drop on the front/corners may be **catastrophic**. The lip of the case doesn't wrap around the corners or edges to offer protection. 

**The Apple Leather case simply doesn't sufficiently hold the phone in.** 

Impact at *any* spot on the front will push the case away and strike the front of the phone. It's like Apple expected the magnet to be sufficient at holding the case on. For general use, it mostly does. It won't help at all if you actually *drop* the phone. 

It offers LESS protection than the previous Apple Leather cases that had open bottoms. Those cases at least had tight lips around each corner that made it impossible for the phone to just **fall** out of the case if dropped. 

I also have the Nomad leather case, which easily provides 100% more protection than the Apple Leather case simply by having a lip that snaps around all corners *and* edges. 

My biggest issue with the Nomad leather case is the buttons. They don't stick out far enough and they just aren't tactile. Mushy, indeed."
51788,I disagree. The apple leather case feels very stiff and actually requires some effort to remove it. I‚Äôm using the black official leather case with an iPhone 12
51789,I haven't had that experience.  I find it rather difficult to get off the phone.  I've dropped it face down on pavement and the screen protector never even scratched.
51790,"I applaud you. I tend to always go overboard with cases as well, trying out each one and narrowing them down to my top 3. I‚Äôm still deciding on what case for my iPhone 11 Pro midnight green"
51791,"Thanks for sharing!  For my 12 pro I ended up with the [SupCase Unicorn Beetle Clear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HVJTX28/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (quite the name). I like the feel and wanted to be able to see the nice pacific blue phone color.   But, now seeing the Ringke, I think I just might have to try that one out.  Definitely hits all the right (other) buttons."
51792,"And that, my friends, is commitment"
51793,Thanks for this!!!!!
51795,Is the buttons on the rhinoshield that bad? cs i was thinking of getting it for my 12pm
51797,Ahh i see because most of the issues i‚Äôve read that people have with rhinoshield is the grip so im weary if there‚Äôs more than one problem
51799,"Thank you for the review! I‚Äôve been using Nomad rugged leather case, I love the case and I totally agree about the mushy button. It takes time for me to get used to it. 

I also have Spigen Ultra Hybrid Anti-crack clear case. While the case is great and offer a good protection, the fit is very tight and I‚Äôm afraid to scratch the side of my glossy iPhone 12 Pro whenever I put/remove the case. Also the back case is glossy and leaves a lot of smudges and fingerprints. Not recommended."
51800,"I really enjoyed this and you definitely saved tons of time and money for anyone reading your post!

Thanks to you, I'm going Rinke Fusion and splurging on an Apple Leather. I would've spent more than those two combined anyway over the life of my phone but now I have the clear option for stickers and the classy leather (which I would've pined over but dismissed as apple premium charge for mediocre quality)

Thanks again - you seem like a great techy and good human!"
51801,This guy cases.
51802,"Your photo series for your phone cases are INSANE. 

Also I cant believe you did not review a single case from Otterbox. Come onnnnn"
51803,"Wow. This is impressive and helpful. Thanks for the detailed reviews of these cases.

I‚Äôve been on a quest to find a thin, clear TPU case that doesn‚Äôt have a screen lip. I had a totallee case for my iPhone X that was like this and it was perfect. Their iPhone 12 cases all have a raised screen lip now, though. Same for peel, who used to always make a thin soft TPU clear case with button cutouts and only a camera lip.

Did you happen to find one through this journey?"
51804,"Depending on your preference, the baseus offerings may meet your needs. The matte frosted version is as thin as totallee, with button cutouts, but also an ever so slight lip up front to make sure the case doesn‚Äôt come off too easily. 

They also make clear tpu versions with very little front screen lip. Both of them are in the photo stash so see if they fit your needs. 

Ringke standard designs have raised fronts so that wouldn‚Äôt be a choice. Check them out if you change your mind"
51805,"I‚Äôve been going through a few cases myself and have decided on Apple‚Äôs Silicon Case, Caseology‚Äôs Parallax, Bellroy‚Äôs Leather Case, and ‚Äî my personal favorite going on 3x iPhone models now ‚Äî Smartish‚Äôs Kung Fu Grip: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M21569G/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_api_glc_fabc_Iy27FbZAW0D9K.

The KFG is affordable, slim, tactile, protective and a pleasure to hold."
51806,"Thanks for KFG recommendation, sounds like a great case. Could you share some photos as well?"
51807,Cheers for the write-up. I think I‚Äôll order myself an Onyx.
51808,Which case is the one with the orange power button?
51809,"No brand frosted case. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to post links here, but they can be easily found on most e-commerce sites under silicone cases for iPhone 12"

51812,"NGL, when I saw a reply from /u/PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES in my inbox, I was bracing myself for something ‚Äòspicy‚Äô... but turns out the link was just to a phone case"
51813,"haha, not without consent first"
51814,Lol. Spoken like a true gentleman
51815,"I sadly was up to 5 or so cases the first week. 

If Apple would stop being lazy and release the battery case I wouldn‚Äôt need to be looking at all these other fancy brands!

Seriously Apple! I need all day charge !

51816,Thank you for all of your work and money spent for this post. It has helped me out and will help other people in the future.
51817,"I bought an Apple saddle brown leather case for my iPhone 12 Pro shortly after getting it. I returned it a few weeks later when I realized that the ""leather"" they are using this year is nothing like the leather they've used in the past. The ""saddle brown"" color is literally brown paint. In that final third week, I realized it was never going to actually patina and instead was just going to wear that paint coat off when I noticed one corner wearing through. It looked awful. My previous saddle brown leather cases looked like actual leather and started patina-ing almost immediately, and they looked incredibly cool a few weeks after getting them (and continued to look cool for the two years I used them.) One is still in use with a friend who has that model iPhone and looks great even over four years later. These new ones are incredibly disappointing."
51818,"May I ask what leather case are you using now, if any?"
51819,Not a leather case right now. I‚Äôm using an Incipio Duo case instead. Kind of thick but it feels nice. I‚Äôm waiting to see if a better leather case option comes along.
51820,"I‚Äôm using the apple silicone (plum) first time I have ever bought case for ¬£40 but it feels great and looks great too. 
I also have a caseology one that looks and feels nice, but I don‚Äôt use it that much."
51822,"They have a pretty big market here in south east Asia, but otherwise yep e-commerce website. You could try Amazon and AliExpress who do ship internationally with tracking"
51823,"And I thought I was a case addict! 
I can‚Äôt seem to find the smart devil cases! Which site did you find them on?"
51824,Here‚Äôs where I got mine: https://s.lazada.com.my/s.c6z2j
51825,ThNk you!
51826,Try Bullstrap leather cases.
51827,"I read in many places that‚Äôs a great alternative, but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt cover the bottom of the phone... but which was a deal breaker for me. It would have otherwise been a great choice!"
51828,I have the Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear case and the Razer Arctech Pro case. Good enough for me currently. üòéüëçüèº
51829,"12 cases in two months? If I had your money, I'd burn mine. /s"
51830,"Moving from a 6s+ to 12Max and went with Catalyst Influence and ESR Tempered Glass. They meshed perfectly. Very happy.

51833,"I have a question, will apple leather case for iPhone 12 get me through 3+ years which is how much time I am planning to use this phone for?"
51834,I love the ringke cases. such good quality and feel for a decent price. deffo recommend.
51835,Are you going to make a video ‚Äú12 iPhone 12s‚Äù
51836,"[$12 bumper cases on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Aluminum-Frame-Metal-Bumper-Slim-Hard-Case-Cover-For-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-12-mini-/402570370741?_trksid=p2349624.m46890.l49292) I use that, a skin, and a screen protector. There are a few cheap but good bumper cases on eBay and I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll find the same ones on Ali Express."
51837,"These look very similar to the aluminium ones that I reviewed. 

I do see tpu versions popping up as well. Soon hopefully there will be good alternatives"
51838,"I love these bumper cases only thing that is annoying is the metal is slippery. An all TPU version would be perfect. These make the phone lay flat, don‚Äôt completely change the shape of the phone and are super light. I feel like I‚Äôve seen TPU versions in the past for the 11 series iPhones but they were substantially thicker."
51839,"What was the issue with the knockoff Apple silicone cases? Are they the red white black trio you hold in the picture together? 

From ali? Cost? Magsafe?"
51840,"They were from shoppee but most likely the same as AliExpress as well. The overall quality is just very poor, as you can see starting from the black one. Catches lint, colours are very bright, and the fit isn‚Äôt well made. The bottom cutout is soft instead of rigid, so it‚Äôs a bit loose around the speakers and charging port. The silicone is so thin you can see through to the hard case within. Here are some photos to show you what I mean:

https://imgur.com/a/K5bTCEI/


No MagSafe for the knockoffs that I tried. Maybe I just got a poor quality batch from a bad seller.

Smartdevil versions are much better made alternatives."
51841,Honestly how is rhino shield over price? Really confused every time people bitch about it
51842,Any signal degradation using a metal bumper?
51843,None so far... test both on WiFi and 4G speeds. Both fluctuate the same
51844,"Great read!

Would recommend the Powersupport Air Jacket for thin cases. They have clear and matte versions. Best thin case imo. A must buy every year. 

For my 12pro's nomad rugged. The lip near the power button doesn't wrap onto the frame, seems 'warped'. Only that part, really strange. Even after an exchange, the same area showing the same issue. üò∞ I can still see some silver frame exposed. Else it's a really awesome case. 

Well, I'm back to my black Apple leather case. Feels the best overall. üôÇ"
51846,"No I didn‚Äôt. But if I did, kumquat would have been my fav Color!"
51847,"No otter? No defender pro? 

Best armor ;)"
51848,"The only case I would use is a life proof fre case, I don‚Äôt want no dust or microscratches on my phone so that‚Äôs why I always recommend that case over it."
51849,While I‚Äôm out here never using cases on my phones.
51850,"Caseless crew! Although I will say my X and XR got hella scratched up. But it‚Äôs okay, these are temporary devices anyway that you replace every 3-4 years or even sooner."
51851,Exactly and I never drop my phones
51852,a new case makes me not want to buy a new phone xD
51853,kind of a waste of money. once the iphones body changes again and with the cameras. all these cases will be useless
51854,Are cases are usually useless except for the phone they made. My iPhone X case won‚Äôt work with my iPhone 12 mini but I don‚Äôt expect it to
51855,"I could have saved you some time.

* Great case and has magsafe: Apple leather case
* Clear, adequate: Spigen Quartz Hybrid or Spigen Liquid Crystal
* Black non-bulky rugged: Casology Vault, at least on 11 Pro  (but they don't make one for 12)

I picked up one Ringke and liked it, but not as much.

Thanks for posting.  My wife gives me crap about buying so many cases over the years but I've landed on my favorite.  I plan to read you reviews in detail.  I might be persueded."
51856,"I ordered 5 different cases and tried them all for a few days, not as many as you but with free returns...why not?

This is the best (and one of the only) true bumper cases for the iPhone 12, and it's awesome: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RJV4NQF/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_EGWMNS0SCZZX9Q2K3VFW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

Have it on my phone now. Works with magsafe, protects all corners, and feels like there is nothing on the phone at all. Back has a nice semi-clear anti-fingerprint coating which actually works (no smudges at all!). Can't beat the price either and looks great with the graphite color."
51857,Can I get a case for my 11?
51858,"Yes, you can go buy one off of any site that sells 11 phone cases."
51859,You know that‚Äôs not what I mean üòë
51860,No. Absolutely not.
51861,"Otterbox Defender all day every day. I work in a warehouse and have dropped my phone more times than I can count. 2 years ago on the freeway, my phone flew off my motorcycle, hit my shoulder, shot up into the air, then came crashing down and get run over by a Honda Accord at 65mph. 2 years later I‚Äôm still using the same phone and same case. Not a scratch on my phone, or a single crack on my screen. It did get bent just a little though."
51862,"That phone has been through a tough time and it‚Äôs still working, unbelievable lol!"
51863,"I can vouch for Otterbox, their cases are incredible. I‚Äôve recommended Otterbox to countless people.  I dropped my phone down the stairs once, it fell down one flight, bounced off the wall then around a corner and down another, phone was as good as new!"
51864,"Which Otterbox would you recommend? I‚Äôm thinking between Commutter and Symmetry, or even back to Defender again."
51865,"I‚Äôve had both a symmetry and defender. The defender was the one that survived the longest, heck that case is still in use by the person I gave it to. 

The symmetry is a bit more like other readily available cases but it does feel very nice in the hand and provides good protection."
51866,I have a symmetry and it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing while also doing a good job at protecting the phone
51867,"When it comes to protective cases I always have peace of mind when I buy the Defender series to protect my phone. Especially when you pair it with a glass screen protector. I‚Äôm rocking the Defender Pro on my Xr which I love as it seems more rugged than your typical Defender case and it covers up the Apple logo.

51868,I can‚Äôt make the step just for the size üò©
51869,It‚Äôs worth it if you need the drop protection but at the cost of making your phone much heavier and bigger.
51870,"The sides looks thick in my opinion. But, this definitely protects your phone."
51871,"You might also want to consider taking a look at Rhinoshield cases. It‚Äôs pretty tough yet maintains a slim look. But my experience with cases (both expensive or cheaper ones) is that they get old and dirty from daily usage eg. in and out of pockets multiple times a day, rather that the simulated drops shown in reviews."
51872,And btw this is the: [Rhinoshield case](http://geni.us/RhinoshieldSolidSuitXs) I am referring to. The brush metal is very nice. It is different from the other series with a clear back.
51873,Instead of a thicker case - I'd love to find something that just had a bump on the opposite side of the camera.  That way it doesn't wobble if I use it while its laying on a desk.
51874,Ringke cases have bumps at the opposite ends of the case that allow the phone to sit flat on a desk
51876,Wish they had a transparent version
51877,"The bunk is actually so big and square on my Tech 21 Evo Check, that it props the promp up a smidge when layed down, like the smallest little incline. It's not bad, and doesn't wobble because it covers over 60% or so of the back horizontal space."
51878,I had this exact thought today too.
51879,The spigen clear case I got for the 12 pro max has the bumps.
51880,My super cheap Insignia (Best Buy) case has this.
51881,"Spigen clear case has this, it allows the phone to sit flat."
51882,I'm looking at that case in my hand right now and it absolutely does not have that bumb.
51883,Mine has a raised ring around the camera
51884,They are talking about the other end of the phone to match the camera bump so it lays flat.
51885,Following - been researching cases all afternoon.  The bumps have gotten out of control.
51886,Check the Ringke Onyx out. Was suggested by u/hossamdex and it seems to be able to lay flat with the things on the corners.
51887,I ordered and received the Spigen Ultra Hybrid in Clear. It has small risers in the three corners opposite the camera lenses resulting in a lay-flat design!
51888,It has no wobble at all when pressing the corners? Or is it just reduced wobble?
51889,No wobble at all. It was very unexpected and a pleasant surprise. I ordered it because it‚Äôs one of the most popular and highly recommended cases year after year. I may still try the Ringke Onyx though.
51890,Oh dang that‚Äôs nice. I much prefer the design of the Spigen so I‚Äôll probably end up going with that. Thanks for the suggestion
51891,"I'd rather just have a thicker phone

Good to know there are cases that solve this I guess"
51892,GShock phone needs to be a thing.
51893,The phone would just be as thick as the iphone 4
51894,I don't think the 4 is that thick
51895,"I think you're right

The camera bump makes the phones thicker than the 4"
51896,"I wouldn't even mind if the whole back is as thick as the 4. that's more space for more features, though I think they did their best to balance between features and thickness on this release"
51897,seriously --- like just make my battery bigger and give my phone a flat back FFS
51898,"I‚Äôm using the Apple leather case with the iPhone 13 Pro and the camera bump is so big (wide), there is very littler wobble to begin with."
51899,"That‚Äôs what I got for my 13 Pro, I got the golden brown (which is orange for the record)"
51900,"It‚Äôs totally orange, haha. I don‚Äôt know if I love it. Wish it was the normal brown leather. Might switch to Midnight"
51901,I‚Äôd definitely switch if you can. I have the same case for the 12 Pro and it does not age well. Pick a darker color or a different case entirely. They are cheaper leather than in years past and won‚Äôt patina. https://i.imgur.com/qGee1fe.jpg
51902,Yeah I was NOT expecting this color. I wanted Saddle Brown. Picked up a Sequoia green as well and will return one of them.
51903,"Yeah, I went with midnight. Wished it was saddle brown."
51904,"That's good to know! I got the Apple Clear today for my 13 Pro, but forgot to check out the Golden Brown."
51905,Is the bottom of the clear case a little loose for you too? Mine is a bit wobbly and it‚Äôs kinda annoying. Thinking of returning it.
51906,"No, mine feels fine. I also like the open bottom portion as, when you swipe up, there's no bump across bottom and you thumb glides right up the iPhone smoothly."
51907,Ahhh thanks. The corners of mine are just loose enough to bug me. Guess I‚Äôll see if I can exchange it or get a leather case instead.
51908,"How clicky are the buttons on the case for you? I've got the leather case for my 13 Pro but the buttons (especially the power button) are very mushy and hard to press when compared to the leather case for the 11 Pro I had before.  
Not sure if normal or a defective case."
51909,Mine are clicky for sure. Case is solid - may wanna contact Apple about the case!
51910,Thank you. I shall do that. Glad to know it's not normal :)
51911,"FWIW, the Apple Clear case has the stiffest, most difficult buttons to press (of the three case materials from Apple)."
51912,I just made the same switch. Is it me or is the new leather nowhere near as good as the Pro 11 case? It seems it‚Äôs the thinnest layer of leather possible. The 11 case had some thickness to it.
51913,How do you like the leather case? I‚Äôm thinking of getting it
51914,"I‚Äôve always preferred the Apple leather cases. Less grippy than silicone but not too slick, and they look nice. I have the sequoia green and it is very dark. Under artificial light, it can appear almost dark grey, and pairs nicely with the Silver finish. But the 13 Pro is pretty chunky and, despite the big bump, the case kind of keeps the wobbles under control."
51915,They have a peeling problem. Looks like the fake leather is painted on.
51916,"The  documentation states ‚Äúquality leather‚Äù. That being said, it must be thin to produce such a thin case. I wouldn‚Äôt expect the same quality as a baseball mitt. I personally haven‚Äôt experienced any obvious defects, although in the past I have seen some peeling after a significant amount of wear. It wasn‚Äôt so obvious on the black cases I have previously owned."
51917,Loving my sequoia green leather case üëåüèº
51918,How dark does it look in real life?
51919,"It‚Äôs quite dark in real life, the pictures on Apple‚Äôs website are accurate.

https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM1Q3ZM/A/iphone-13-pro-max-leather-case-with-magsafe-sequoia-green"
51920,I have one coming in the mail!
51921,"Not the other person but for me I have always liked the leather cases. They are slim especially the Apple variety and I like the patina they get over time. They will be insanely bright at first but will naturally get darker over time.

I went with the blue years ago and it is essentially almost black at this point. It‚Äôs also falling apart but it‚Äôs like I think like 5 years old at this point.

There are people who speed up the process to get the aged look right out of the box."
51922,Exactly what I wanted to hear! Thanks! I‚Äôll try to get it this weekend.
51923,Be careful with the brown one though. As others have pointed out in this sub - that color doesn‚Äôt really age as well and instead gets kinda gross looking around the edges. Seeing those posts made me opt for a non-Apple leather case for the first time in years.
51924,I agree. I saw a lot of posts complaining how they changed the material to a cheaper leather and it doesn‚Äôt age like the older Apple leather cases. I‚Äôve had older Apple leather cases that I loved so I bought the Golden Brown. As soon as I took it out of the box you can feel the difference compared to the old cases. They feel cheaper and overall lesser quality. I‚Äôm planning on returning it and going with Nomad or Woolnut instead.
51925,I got the Nomad this time around. You can see the patina on the website and it looks sick.
51926,I thought most people go for the saddle brown colour because of the nice patina?
51927,It doesn‚Äôt patina as much as just get filthy on the edges. Loved the color for about two days then it got so bad friends won‚Äôt touch my phone because of how filthy the case looks (i guess there‚Äôs positives LOL)
51928,"Really? 90% of the posts I've seen in the past are of people complimenting how nice the patina is on their saddle brown, weird how things have changed"
51930,Can you post a photo?
51931,That's because Apple changed the material on the 12. It had a great patina before that but for some reason the one from last year was shit. I'm wondering if it's the same this year as well.
51932,"I think it is. Idk about last year but I had an 11 Pro and the leather was nice on that case. I just picked up a 13 Pro case and it just seems very thin compared to the 11. Not the case, but the leather. It was a little disappointing considering the cost and how well made the 11 case was"
51933,Mine is arriving soon. Ordered golden brown.
51934,Yeah - hopefully they‚Äôve rectified the issues from last year‚Äôs case cause that‚Äôs the one I wanted too but saw that it didn‚Äôt age that well. I opted for a NOMAD case this time around.
51935,i have bought apple's because of my magsafe wallet. i heard WALLET magnet is much better when using apple leather case.
51936,"Absolutely can confirm this. Naked, the MagSafe wallet just does not feel quite right. With the leather case, it‚Äôs perfect."
51937,Which color did you buy and what iphone you using?
51938,Haven‚Äôt confirmed wallet compatibility as this is going to be my first MagSafe phone. But I‚Äôm getting the Spigen wallet anyway so hopefully it works well with the Nomad case.
51939,"I was thinking abt this but my experience with em hasn‚Äôt been stellar, too bulky"
51940,"Yeah, tbh I went with them cause I love my base station. If it doesn‚Äôt work out well then there‚Äôs plenty of options."
51941,I‚Äôll probably be boring and go for midnight or sequoia
51942,It‚Äôs unfortunate they made the leather cases so poorly last year and seems like it‚Äôs the same. No more patina
51943,400 grit Sandpaper. Give a little rub and remove some of that ‚Äúprotective finish.‚Äù I might do that if I don‚Äôt start seeing signed of patina.
51944,I‚Äôve got the leather case for my 13 Pro and it‚Äôs amazing. Would highly recommend
51945,Which color did you get?
51946,Midnight. I just wanted something sleek and simple with my Graphite phone
51947,"Cool that‚Äôs the one I ordered, for my graphite. It‚Äôs pretty slim, right?"
51948,Yes it‚Äôs very slim
51949,Same.  I had colorful cases for the 12 pro max and I also bout a marigold silicone case for the 13 pro max but ultimately I ran and grabbed a midnight leather case yesterday and wow. I forgot how good a black case on a black phone looks. Hahaha funny how that works
