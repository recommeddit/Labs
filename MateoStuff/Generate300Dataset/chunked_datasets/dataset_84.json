26916,I love watching them trend downwards.
26917,"I think Pandemic, Pandemic legacy, Season 1, season 2 and season 0 will be there too"
26918,"I don't think so. Season 2 has been much more divisive.  


But I'm ""worried"" about the Gloomhaven top 3.  


To be fair I think these lists are less and less relevant. People slaps 10 and 0 left and right nowadays."
26919,"Fair enough, I was exaggerating a bit to expand on the point.

But definitely worried about the 10 and 0 people throw around. I haven't played any game deserving of a 0. I actually find it very hard to believe a game commonly know that actually deserves a 0. I mean it would have to be outright broken to the point that it couldn't be played."
26920,"I agree on the 0 part. But that's also another reason these ratings are quite hard to judge; their scale vary a lot from player to player.

Two people could think the same about the same games, and their rating could be very differents."
26921,"Definitely. Board games is, like many things, quite subjective in that regard.

Its sort of the same with movies. Even well known and respected critics can end up on different halves of the scale.

So it is indeed just as important to be aware one's own opinions when looking for new games to try."
26922,People always think something will be invicible at the top until it isn't.  I wouldn't worry about it.
26923,Which of these games are great to play with a 7yr old?
26924,Quacks!
26925,"thanks, will give that a try :)"
26926,A lot of that depends on the attention span of the child as well as individual interests.  Finding the right theme is really helpful as well.  What is your kid interested in?
26927,Play **Twilight Imperium** so that he/she can save the earth in case of a bugger invasion.
26928,"Maybe Quacks, but it depends on what the 7yr old is enjoying right now. What are the kids favorite game mechanics, what does the kid like to play?  
Anything the Kid is a fan of? Maybe a comic series or a TV Series?  


Game I can recommend is Honga from Haba. Honga is a good introduction into woker placing mechanism and tile placement mechanism. It isn't complex and has a colorful artwork.  
Second game is King of the Dice from Haba. Awesome introduction into dice rolling, set collection and push your luck mechanism. Have I mentioned, that King of the Dice can help your children learning math.  


When the kid is more experienced with boardgames you can try out Azul and Quacks."
26929,thanks - might give quacks a try.   Last game we played was Wingspan and she likes that
26930,"Azul, Dominion and Pandemic come to mind (not too heavy). Apart from that maybe try Hanabi (good, short coop) or Forbidden Desert/Island (good gateway games)."
26931,"I'm interested in pandemic - is a 7yr old going to get it?  She has a fair bit of board game experience - kingdomino, wingspan, camel up, sushi go, machi koro"
26932,"You know, generally I would recommend Forgotten Island as gateway to Pandemic, because it shares a lot of core mechanics. If she has already played Wingspan though (which is fairly complex imo), she will probably be fine."
26933,I second Forbidden Island.  Great game to play with a child that age.
26934,I am a new convert to Pax Pamir. That game is amazingly good. Like Brass level good for me.
26935,"This ranking is compiled from game ratings by members of the [Redditor's Guild](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1290) on BoardGameGeek. If you wish to have your game ratings reflected in these stats, simply join the guild."
26936,"Okay 3 years and Gloomhaven still is considered number 1?  I haven't been able to pull the trigger on paying for that game since it feels like it's going to be another Twilight Imperium in that I play it 1 time maybe in a year, but generally it's on the shelf for 2-3 years before I find people who want to invest time in it."
26937,"The big difference with Gloomhaven is a single session can be played in an hour or two, unlike TI4."
26938,How many people are you playing with? I play with four and we average about three hours for one scenario.
26939,"When I played we did 2-3 players. Are you guys talking a lot? You should only be able to do 36 turns maximum. That’s almost 2 minutes per turn taking an hour. Cards are chosen simultaneously, and their numbers given you the order, so there’s not that much left to think about after that."
26940,"We play 4 players, and it usually takes about 3 hours per scenario. That does include some set up time, which we often do pretty slowly, as we're socializing and chatting about other things."
26941,Well we do have one of those guys that we are usually waiting on who will overthink their turn. But I didn't think it added an hour to our game.
26942,"I play with 3 players and a scenario usually takes around 2 hours, but some of them have been quite a bit shorter."
26943,Same here. By the time we get everything set up and go through the adventure it is about 3-4 hours for 4 people.
26944,I play with 4 and we can finish a scenario in 1 hour. We also use gloom haven helper for less bookkeeping and more playing
26945,Same for my 4 man party. We tend to play most games a bit slower but it's fine since we're having a good time.
26946,"A roomate and I went through like 80ish of the gloomhaven scenarios together, and in that period I was able to fit like maybe 5-6 TI4 games? It is totally feasible to play a few GH scenarios in one evening compared to TI."
26947,"It's absolute rating has fallen over time, but I think that happens to every game on a long enough time scale. Other games are just falling faster and new ones aren't rising quite quick enough!"
26948,"Mine has been doing exactly that.  I'll knock out a couple others first, but I've resolved that I'm gonna end up playing it solo."
26949,"Gloomhaven Helper and organizer greatly, greatly, reduce the length of setup and play."
26950,"It’s a good game, but there more and more I play the more flaws I see. I still enjoy it, still currently play. But I no longer rank it a 10/10."
26951,What would you consider a flaw?
26952,"For me personally, the writing, the repetitive nature of encounters, the setup is starting to wear on me.

Also probably the biggest one is the nature of the game to prioritize some classes mechanics over others. I like the variety that appears to be available, but once you’re out there and playing a lot of the mechanics fall by the wayside because they simply aren’t worth using. Trying to set up combos over multiple turns feels next to impossible, and with some classes that just ruins their mechanics.

My group is currently playing forgotten circles, and as you see the creators trying to make more and more unique scenarios, you can see the “different” classes not being able to work with the mechanics as well. If you are a bruiser who can tank some dmg, then id say all scenarios will work for you, if you aren’t, then you’ll come across more than a few where you feel like you’re along for the ride at best, and a liability at worst.

Like I said, I’m not trying to shit on the game, I do enjoy it and have played it more than any other game we have, but I just don’t feel it’s polished enough to warrant a 10/10"
26953,That's fair criticism.  I'm only about 25 sessions in and have only seen 2 non-starting classes so I'm not completely knowledgeable about some of your claims.
26954,"You can play it solo, it's still fun and you don't need to gather a group"
26956,"What's the next game you are thinking of giving a boost to? That's a lot of power and responsibility, trust no one!"
26957,Can't wait for Brass Birmingham to go back on sale
26958,cant wait for Brass to get in stock here lol. Dont wanne buy it online. prefer to support local game shop
26959,Its always crazy to see how big this hobby is.  I've played and liked only five games out of the top 100.
26960,I've played about 31 and own 19.
26961,"Same. I own 5 on this list. One of those I just bought yesterday (Azul), and 2 others I have yet to play. But I own em..."
26962,"Played 42, own 25, that's a surprising number that I've not played!"
26963,"Sekigahara, NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
26964,Nice to see Pax Pamir 2 getting a rank it deserves
26965,Curious about the large discrepancy in Terraforming Mars' position. Is the sentiment here that it's a bit overrated?
26966,"Large discrepancy?????

We have very different definitions of large. It's 13 spots."
26967,"It's large compared to most of the games in the top 50 positions, which are rated similar or higher than their BGG ranking: the only similar case is Through The Ages."
26968,">  which are rated similar

One could argue that every game in the top 100 on a list of almost 50.000+ items, are rated similarly."
26969,"Why you stopped at Reddit 50 is beyond logic; if a game is going to be a large downfall for us, why would it still have to fall into REDDIT'S top 50? That would require it to be a top 37 game to start with, but not be such a large disparity that it would fall out of top 50. That is so illogical (and still somehow missed Scythe and Blood Rage).

If using BGGs top 50, as logic would dictate, there is 7th Continent, Imperial Assault, Wingspan, Robinson Crusoe, Puerto Rico, Mansions of Madness, Through the Ages, Anachrony, and 7 Wonders which are all top 50 BGG games with bigger drops than TM."
26970,"Compared to the rank __3__, yeah, 13 spots is definitely a large difference. Its subreddit rank is over five times lower than its bgg rank."
26971,"Quick thought experiment: What if instead, you ranked the worst game 1, and best game 96,409?

The difference for TM would then be 1.00013 times.

That's why when doing percentiles, you don't use multiplication, you use standard deviation."
26972,"...and the average absolute rank deviation of the top 10 of BGG compared to this list is 3.8 spots. Relative to the other top ranking games, TM's 13 spot drop is quite large no matter how you look at it."
26973,It’s unquestionably overrated
26974,"But, of the top 20 or so, unquestionably the only one that a new hobbiest could buy blindly and be almost guaranteed to understand and enjoy."
26975,"I doubt strongly that a new hobbyist would be able to understand and enjoy Terraforming Mars. Terraforming Mars isn't a gateway game OR a next step game. It's a solidly middle-weight game, that is long, has some fiddly upkeep, and lots of symbology. 

The first games in the top 20 that I would show a newer gamer would be 7 Wonders Duel, Viticulture, Concordia, and The Castles of Burgundy."
26976,"I can only speak from my own experience, but I've noticed folks who don't game much love the engine building and the theme. It's easier for them to get around the fiddliness for an exciting theme and that constant feeling of progress. Wheras dry, point-salady Euros can be VERY hit or miss (and I do love me some dry, point-salady Euros).

7 Wonders Duel could work well, though."
26977,"I agree with everything but ""lots of symbology"" - In TM, literally every symbol is explained on that card. Yes there is symbols and lots of them, but it is never confusing."
26978,"Do you think that people are incapable of playing more complicated games or something?

My first modern hobby game was Agricola and I had no trouble with it. I had played Catan and Carcassonne before that, but nothing like Agricola.

Give people some more credit."
26979,"You really should realize that you are an outlier. I give people exactly as much credit as they deserve. I have taught games to a lot of people, and the majority of them have their eyes glaze over when you pull out a game that will have a 20+ minute rules explanation and a 3 hour first-timer playtime."
26980,"Different people come to board games from very different backgrounds.

Someone that plays Dwarf Fortress and understands it would have no problem learning a complex game.

Someone who has played nothing but Go Fish or Candy Crush level stuff probably isn't.

Picking a strategy game for someone that wants to play a social game isn't going to work. Picking a strategy game for someone who wants to challenge themselves is fine.

I've always been a gamer. I agree that you should pick a game appropriate to what the players might be interested in, but beyond that, understand that I'm not saying that you throw Lisboa at everyone, but consider what they are interested in.

If someone is interested in a challenging game about sustenance farming, then Agricola is a fine place to start. If they are expecting Farmville, it's obviously not."
26981,"I agree man! Most people in the hobby are adults and ""there's too many symbols"" is the weirdest form of gatekeeping I see exist as a trope in the hobby. I mean, yeah, it takes a little bit of work, but most folks I know see my kallax's full of games and ask ""which is your favorite?"" When I respond, their response is ""well can we play *that?""*  I've never responded with ""well, it's a bit much for someone who doesn't play games."" Just seems elitist and unwelcoming."
26982,"I find it quite funny how me as an avid tabletop collector and gamer have played maybe a handful of the top 100 and of those I have played and know from the list, none of these fit my genre of board game.

I own around 100 games (will try and update my BGG collection for accuracy) and I've really pushed away Euro games, worker placement, set collection, etc. games that are all on this list."
26983,"You’re overstating the euros here. This list includes Twilight Imperium 4, War of the Ring, Star Wars Rebellion, Root, Blood Rage, Kemet, Kingdom Death Monster, etc.

This sub has a pretty balanced taste"
26984,">  I've really pushed away Euro games, worker placement, set collection, etc. games

What the hell's left? ;)"
26985,"ha! I like dexterity games, story telling games, party games - most of my group are sports bros so I gravitate towards mindless random fun."
26986,"Area Control, Dudes on a Map, and Negotiation.

The ones that matter :P"
26987,"Isn't the ""people on a map"" category a sub-category of Area Control?"
26988,There's more variety here than in the BGG top 100 for what it's worth.
26989,I'm glad to see Root rise a little bit. It's a recent purchase of mine after I had fun with one game of it but one of the complaints I've heard about it is lack of replay-ability after playing all the factions. I'm hoping this is a sign that there is some longevity to the game.
26990,"I don't agree with that sentiment. Even with the same factions, the starting positions, up to 4 maps (randomly seeded) and hell, what you draw (and from which deck) will keep me entertained for good while."
26991,"I'm a bit surprised at its low (i.e. lower than BGG average) ranking here too. It's my only 10 (I recently promoted it from 9 seeing as my friends and I spent a whole lunchtime talking about its meta and having a great time), and I'm definitely not bored after 20-ish games roughly evenly spread across the base and first expansion factions.

My guess is that its complex inter-faction interactions put people off, since it takes a few games for it to really click. I would definitely put it closer to 2019 Dune's 3.8 rating because of this emergent weight."
26992,"My wife and I straight up hate code names duet

Just such little room for creativity. No drama. Boring"
26993,Do you guys like any other codenames game?
26994,I regret not buying forbidden stars. That game seems right up my alley and I always second guessed myself and never ended up pulling the trigger.
26995,Marvel champions forgotten?
26996,Probably not enough reviews
26997,Any idea what the minimum number of reviews is? Smallest I see on the chart is 165 for **Aeon's End: War Eternal**.
26998,"It changes depending on the size of the guild. And I actually don't cut anything. I just sandbag everything with a number of ""average votes"" sort of the way BGG does it for their ""BGG Rating"". Things under 200 or so ratings need to be REALLY well liked to get on this list."
26999,"Huh, I was under the impression that that was based on raw ratings by guild members... Is it 200 dummy votes?"
27000,"Something I learned quickly when first trying to do this is raw ratings never work. They always give you bizarre results cuz niche and lifestyle games rocket to the top of the list. And that's not what you want. You want a list that can at least kinda/sorta be generalized to folks in the sub who didn't vote. 

The second thing I leaned is there isn't actually one, agreed upon statistical way to handle this problem. Other than insaneballs Bayesian averaging that I am not trained to do.

Most people play with a lot of hard-coded values with thresholds and dummy votes until they get something that seems to work well enough. Imdb and BGG both take this approach so, I figure I'm in good company. But the number of dummy votes and the value of said dummy vote is dynamic based on the data I get, so I'm at least trying to avoid arbitrary decisions.

**tl:dr** no, the # of dummy votes is based on the size of the guild"
27001,"I mean, if you like it that's great, but I found it super generic and boring. And I think my opinion might be a more common opinion on it especially after watching a few YouTube reviewers review it."
27002,"Not forgotten here.  It hasn't cracked the Top 100 at BGG but it's getting close. I expect to hit the Top 100 by the end of the month at the rate it's moving up.  I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I play it solo more so just because of family dynamics, but my son really loves it.  We both prefer it over Sentinels of the Multiverse because it's more streamlined and easier to manage for our tastes."
27003,How did Lords of Waterdeep not make the list? That's one of my groups favorite when we only have 3-4 players.
27004,"Because it is rated lower by this group of people than BGG at large.

There are a lot of games in this list that have a certain bite to them that keeps them out of the BGG top 100. There are 18xx games, a few more cult classic type games, and there is a bit more focus on heavier games.

Because there's also no Bayesian smoothing happening to the rating here, it allows less played games  to go higher in the ranks. If you look through the list and see games that are rated much higher here than on BGG, it's usually a combination of a slightly more dedicated crowd, and, again, classic games that have withstood the test of time.

Lords of Waterdeep, to me, is not remotely a stand out game. It's not bad, but a bunch of other games do a very similar thing about as well as it does them. 1830 or Indonesia or Sidereal Confluence, however, have a bit more uniqueness to them."
27005,"> Because there's also no Bayesian smoothing happening to the rating here

There actually is! But it's a smaller data set and a smaller crowd so, yeah, niche games are still gonna get more play on this list."

##Anomolies

* Cosmic Encounter is 1977, 1991, 2000, and 2008 - I believe most are referring to the 2008 edition so I used that.
* Agricola was 2007, Agricola Revised was 2016 - with only minor game play differences I went with the original as I suspect many reviewers don't distinguish the two.
* Pandemic Legacy Season 1 and 2 had an a/b listing (making this technically a list of 101 games) - and though they are fairly different in implementation I lumped them together and used Season 1's 2015 date over Season 2's 2017 date.
* Trajan has a 1991 and 2011 release - but I doubt any of the reviewers means the 1991 Strategy & Tactics magazine game.
* Santorini has a 2004 self-published release and a 2016 release, and I suspect most are thinking of the cartoony artwork version of this abstract game.

##Personal Analysis

In terms of this subreddit, divide up gaming into 3 major epochs right now:

* pre-modern games (before Magic/Catan or about 1993 to 1995)
* modern gaming (at or after Magic/Catan or about 1993 to 1995)
* kickstarter modern gaming (at or after kickstarter and its platform growth, around 2009 to 2011)... maybe I should call this post-modern game design. ;p

The years are ""fuzzy"" and I normally say 1995 and 2009; but during these transitional windows you had games of the older design school and the newer design school simultaneously existing.

Using those division, all top 10 games are Kickstarter Modern Games (not meaning they launched on Kickstarter, but that they were released once Kickstarter became a major force in the board gaming market and brought in new design styles via crowdfunding).  Even the top 25 are almost all from this (4 titles outside of the epoch, but just by a year).  Only 1 game is pre-modern, and that is **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**, a game that is mostly the same and only had minor changes to content and components over the decades.

Another way to look at it is:

* 4% of the top 100 are from last year (probably too new of a year to have many claim top titles from 2019)
* 15% is from the prior 2 years
* 30% are from the prior 3 years
* 43% are from the prior 4 years
* 59% are from the prior 5 years
* 68% are from the prior 6 years (a full 2/3 of ""top rated"" games by these critics are from 2014 on)
* 87% are from the Kickstarter modern game epoch
* 1% are in the pre-modern game epoch
* 12% are in the modern game epoch

Seeing this data I wonder how much is design and component quality improvement, how much is improved marketing and market growth, and how much is reviewer age bias (ie, tending to be younger and not experiencing some of the older games because they weren't flashy enough).

I've already seen an effect online where a person gets into the hobby and all the new game styles they encounter over the next few years are great; but then novelty wears off and they start recognizing common mechanisms and find games 3-5 years after they got into the hobby to be ""hyped"" (while new gamers find them stunningly innovative). So many reviewers also rode the rise of social media and YouTube, and that boom time was post-2009; is it fairly possible that their immersion into the hobby during the rise of this new media influenced their preferences?  What would the boardgame landscape have looked like (and ratings) if most encontered games in the mid-90s or mid-00s and then became big reviewers?

Anyway, I'd also urge caution on drawing any conclusions from such a simple analysis of data. It is just interesting tidbits to consider when looking at a wider array of elements.  Now it will be interesting to see what impact COVID-19 will have on the hobby in the next coming decade, as I think that might start another shift in the hobby (more towards having digital options to play or methods to play physical games remotely - you know, like how people used to play chess by mailing each other their moves as they play over months)."
27017,"> a full 2/3 of ""top rated"" games by these critics are from 2014 on

I'm not surprised by this. In my opinion 2014-2016 was when a ton of really great board games all came out at once. It's like there was a slow build up and then an explosion in 2014. Honestly I'm sort of wondering if that was a bit of a golden age. I feel like over the past few years there haven't been as many amazing games coming out each year, at least compared to that time period."
27018,"I also feel like this curve matches the big boom of new players that happened 5ish years ago.  There are a ton of fantastic pre-2016 games that often don't appear on these lists because so many people are trying to get through the list of games that are still in print and easily findable at the stores.  I mean, who will want to review a classic that's been 10 years out of print that no one can track down without paying a premium?

Overall though, this is a solid list that I feel does a better job than BGG at showing quality of a game than popularity of a game."
27019,"""Am I wrong for not liking Wingspan?""
""No, it's the experts who are wrong."""
27020,"I mean, **Wingspan** is a fairly light short playing game with a good degree of randomness - it isn't a bad game, but I don't think it is a great game; just average and far too light for my tastes.  Out of the whole game, I like it is one of the few where workers are reduced as you play (similar to tying up cubes in **Historia**).

As to ""experts"" - what ""experts""?  These are just people who chose to make a living at reviewing boardgames (or a hobby of it at least); I don't think there is any formal training or experience that would qualify them as experts, but they are more knowledgeable than the average person in the breadth of field study.  I don't mean to downplay their skill, but expert for me feels like a rather strong term."
27021,"For a long time BGer like me, Wingspan scratches an itch that I feel like we hadn't had in a LONG time.  

Early on, gateway games (Catan/Carcassone) were more complex than the gateways we see today (Codenames/Secret Hitler) and also fill a different need.  Today's gateways are made to make new converts into the gaming world, where 10-15 years ago you were playing Catan because you were always a bit nerdy but didn't realize these types of games existed.

Because of this, he early bridge between a gateway and something more complex and meaty was a game like Wingspan.  Introduced more complex strategies and ideas like card engines that would have been a bit more advanced for a gateway game.  You'd use this type of game to move towards the ones that would be combining everything you'd learned up to this point to dive in deep.

Today the idea if a gateway is more simplified (party games) and that moves a game like Catan or Azul into that mid-range.  Until Wingspan I feel like we didn't have much to jump between Azul and Scythe or Feast For Odin."
27022,"Tom Vasel and Rahdo did a fantastic job explaining this in their ""Top 10 Games of the Decade."" Wingspan is a non-gateway game marketed as a gateway game and it is brilliantly done."
27023,You're the real mvp
27024,"Woohoo, **Space Base** in the top 100! I am surprised about **Dinosaur Island** being so high up though. The reviews I read seemed kind of meh, which is why I decided against getting it. Was I wrong to skip it?"
27025,"Dinosaur Island is one of my favorites, and a hit with everyone I’ve played it with.  You should go back and watch the reviewers that rated it high."
27026,"I played Dinosaur Island a couple of times and am not fussed about playing it again.

I like Dinogenics, though."
27027,"Dino Island was just average for me. Nothing amazing, nothing really awful, just sort of middle-of-the-road. It was fun enough, but the set-up and tear down was way too long for how light of a game it is.   

I went all in on the last KS, played it about 4 times, never even touched the expansion and then sold it on. The theme is what hooked me, but the game just wasn’t good enough to stay in my collection."
27028,Thank you good sir! (Didn’t work well on mobile)
27029,What is this swiping sorcery!?
27030,You made me scroll right/left
27031,"I read, “for those who hate to scroll...” glanced at the list, saw it was 100-76. 

And proceeded to scroll for like five minutes. Good grief."
27032,"Roll fort he galaxy.  

That’s funny"
27033,"Haha, edited :)"
27035,"I was gonna ask, is A Feast for Odin really that good?"
27036,"It is a fantastic game no doubt. Still, a little odd to see it at one. I don't think it's anyone's number one game, but everyone still rates it very highly"
27037,It's my number one!
27038,Flair doesn't check out
27039,Mine checks out ;)
27040,"It's an older flair, sir, but it checks out. I was about to change it."
27042,"I've never played any of Uwe's other worker placement besides FFO. Is worth checking out any you just mentioned? Also, what worker placements do you think are better  than FFO?"
27043,"It’s like agricola mixed with his polyomino games with 10x the action spaces,

Soo.. peek uwe"
27044,"I though I liked board games, but it's like you're talking in Mandarin."
27045,"*[Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola)* - farming-themed worker placement game by designer Uwe Rosenberg (see below)

*[polyomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino)* - generic term for a tile or domino which is not necessarily the usual rectangular shape (think [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)) - used as a mechanic in [several of Uwe's games](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/85659/uwe-rosenbergs-polyominoes) including [Patchwork](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork)

*peek* - probably meant to say ""peak"" :) - meaning that it's a classic Uwe game, utilising all the mechanics he's famous for

*uwe* - [Uwe Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Rosenberg), prolific board game designer, first came to fame for Bohnanza - went on to design many classics like Agricola, [Le Havre](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35677/le-havre) and the game under discussion here, [A Feast for Odin](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177736/feast-odin)."
27046,"Uwe is famous for action selection games where you have to “feed your family”; basically a mechanic where you lose resources or lose points every round Proportionally to how many workers you have.

He’s also famous for Tetris tile puzzle games.

He then made a game with 50 something worker placement spaces and a huge amount of puzzle pieces to fill a massive personal player board, with an expansion that replaces that worker placement board with an entire new one.

You could get his tighter Smaller games Agricola and patchwork and probably enjoy the concepts of feast for Odin better, feast for Odin is just...more.

 I compare it to watching batman 89’ as a kid, and then getting to see a huge spectacle like avengers 3."
27047,"I was rather lukewarm on it when I tried it, honestly"
27048,"I just played it for the first time last night.  It's good, but probably won't crack my personal top 10.  We'll see though, definitely need to play it a couple more times to see how it is once I have it down better.  My wife did terribly though (I won 65 to -16), so hopefully she puts it together better the second time and enjoys it or I won't play it past a second time any time soon anyway.  It is the most ""euro"" game I've ever played."
27049,"Saw this on the ‘Stay at Home’ tab and imagined families going straight from Monopoly to A Feast For Odin. Put them off board games for life.

I do really enjoy FfO, it’s more of an experiment in mapping history to board game mechanics, if it weren’t the dedication to the theme then, really, there’s no need for the game to have quite that much stuff. I’d be interested to see a FfO lite with a more focused board but retaining the Patchwork puzzle for each player."
27050,"I haven't played it but it strikes me as the ultimate uncontroversial pick. Nobody would disagree with you if you had it high up in your list but as you've said it seems pretty rare to see it as the number one game in any individual list. People seem to feel more strongly one way or the other for Gloomhaven, Scythe, and Terraforming Mars than they do for A Feast for Odin."
27051,"This list is skewed heavily towards games I enjoy, but don't love. I would love to be able to put in my own games ranking and see which reviewers I track with the most."
27052,"That’s the advantage and disadvantage of this kind of aggregation. It’s like Rotten Tomatoes. Games that are ranked highly aren’t necessarily the *best*, they’re the ones that are most *consistently* highly rated."
27053,"Makes sense, being on more lists at 50 puts you higher than a few top tens."
27054,Can I make a small suggestion of just a condensed list of titles at the end? I know most of these games so scrolling through the descriptions and details is a little laborious to me. I'd rather see the list and then go find a particular outlier and see who voted how. Unless I missed that?
27055,I can do that! I’ll try and get that incorporated today.
27056,Thanks a ton. You're awesome.
27057,"You made a really great list here, and seem to be really taking all suggestions well. Thanks for being such a cool part of this community dude."

27065,"This is absolutely amazing! I've been hearing from many people that the rankings on BGG are skewed towards newer games, which distorts the results away from titles that are actually more popular in terms of numbers of players, etc. Can you explain a little about your methodology in creating this list?"
27066,"I mean, in some ways this is also likely to be skewed, albeit potentially in different ways. I cover methodology lightly at the end https://boardgamesquad.com/top-games-meta-list/#Notes_about_Data_Methodology_and_Changes_from_the_Previous_List

The basic idea of Borda is for a ranked list, say 1-10. The highest ranked is given a score of 10 and the lowest is given a score of 1. You can then essentially combines scores across lists to find an aggregation. There’s a little bit more to it in this case, but that’s the gist of the idea. I tried a method called CEMC that yielded slightly better results, but when the list got this large it became computationally impossible."
27067,"I always wondered about ranked list scoring, if there was a better way to assign a score. For example, in Formula 1, instead of ranks 1-10 getting 10-1 points respectively, first place gets 25, second gets 18, third gets 15, down to 10th getting 1 point. I have no idea if one way is better than any other, though, or how easy/effective it would be to extrapolate this from a 10-item ranking to 100 items."
27068,"I'm not OP, but strictly from a mathematical standpoint, there's no clear-cut best way to assign scores in a Borda count-like method. I think the Formula 1 counting method works well in a situation where you want to emphasize taking risks to try to win a race. In the situation where you're looking for a game that your entire gaming group will enjoy, I think that a standard 100-1 point ranked list may work better here because it rewards games that a large number of reviewers rank highly."
27069,"It's impossible to do it fairly. Since someone might have a list where they feel their #1 is waaaayyy better than their #5, no brainer. Or someone might feel like their top 5 are neck and neck and just kind of edge each other out barely, and could be easily in a shuffled order. Do you weight their rankings the same? 

A scale of 0.0-10.0 to rate games is a better solution, and then your personal #1 would be your highest rated game. But then how do you make sure everyone has the same idea of scale, and what a 5.0 or 8.5 is?

So since you can't do it fairly, the best way to do it is transparently (like here), so people can make conclusions while still understanding how you ended up where you did."
27070,This list is also extremely skewed to newer games.
27071,"It is, but in the case of the subject study I think that makes sense as well.  Many more new reviewers who aren't going to go out of their way to look at something released 10+ years ago because it's long OOP.  

They won't get the views they would if they stuck to something more recent that is available in shops.  Not to mention if they get review copies of games shipped to them from publishers, no one will send them a copy of a classic game unless there is a reprint."
27072,I'm really surprised with some of these. Cool idea. Thanks for putting this together.
27073,Eldritch Horror is probably my all time favorite game and I was sad to not see it on this list. But seeing Mansions of Madness as the #5 pick made up for it. I’m a horror game junkie.
27074,"AH: LCG and AH 3rd edition (surprisingly) showing up as well. I love third edition though, so I’m happy to see it. Just picked up Eldritch Horror recently too and excited to learn it!"
27075,"I was delighted by those two making the list as well. AH 2e was the first board game that really got me into dense, thematic gaming. Especially of the cooperative kind. That was like, 12 years ago but I still remember being completely enamored by it. The horror and storytelling aspects of it absolutely blew me away. 

I love 3e too but I think it will be so much better with the release of more expansions. I’m excited for that. 

EH is a beast. Get ready for a clustercuss of a game. The rules aren’t super crazy but once you get them down, it becomes a very fun, immersive game where anything can happen. Every expansion can be permanently integrated with the base game and they’re all really good, in my opinion. Each one adds so much more to the game. I hope you enjoy it!

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk."
27076,"I am not a fan. Most people making this ""meta list"" have very similar tastes and it leads to an over representation of a particular type of game, especially in the top 10."
27077,"In my opinion, the list is embarrassingly bad."
27079,This list is so heavily weighted towards engine builders.  Games for people who don't like conflict.
27080,"Honestly, most people I know don't like board games with direct conflict. Too often you can totally wreck someone and that's not fun for most people."
27081,I can’t agree more.
27082,"Heh...yeah, that became immediately apparent when I saw Feast for Odin in the top spot.  Gives a nice summary of the games that the most boardgamey people like the most though! :)"
27083,"This is a great list of games for people who are real aficionados.  It's a very good counterpoint to the popularity-contest type list made by the ""people's choice top 100"" every year."
27084,Great. Now I'm aware of the 7th Continent but there's absolutely no way for me to play it :(
27085,"You can get in the Serious Poulp store (classic version). It’s even cheaper than the KS, which I’m personally bitter about."
27086,Wat?! Why is it super expensive on amazon and ebay then?
27087,People don’t know any better I guess. Check it out https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/?utm_source=seriouspoulp&utm_medium=home_sp&utm_content=classic
27088,Any must-have accessories or expansions in your opinion? I'm about to order!
27089,"I only have the base game personally. I’ve been thinking about getting some expansion material though myself. It’s a really good game to play over coffee in the morning. I find it oddly relaxing. Although, I think I like Tainted Grail more for a exploration game (that you can’t get right now unfortunately)."
27090,Have you played 2-player? Thinking of getting it to play with my wife once we exhaust Gloomhaven.
27091,It’s different from their KS version. There’s a KS version and a retail version
27092,Is it different in a way that impacts any rules or gameplay?
27093,"No you just don’t get the minis (which are meh) and more cards. But the price was substantially higher so this is a great starting point. 
The bone dice accessory is pretty cool, the journal and notebook meh.
Any additional expansion stuff you get for the game just adds to the exploration which you aren’t even guaranteed of seeing in your play through.
So I say don’t sweat it and just order the base and you’ll be fine"
27094,"I believe this is their non-KS version. No minis, less cards, etc."
27095,"Brawling Brothers seem to skew results for a few of them because a game is really popular/well liked within their circle, and you got answers from all three of them rather than just one of them. Paladins of the West Kingdom and Underwater Cities for example. Age of Steam, Heavy Cardboard. Nice to see Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species and GWT stay on the top 100, truly some of the GOAT."
27096,"Yup. A lot of weight in their favor by their close circle. 

Yet Elaine and Efka, two separate people (likely that would have their own unique top 10) has a weight equal to just ONE of them, because that's the video(s) they put out.

Definitely an imperfect system, but you can only do what you can with the data you're given. Sure, you could homogenize the list that come from the same outlet/channel, but Ambie has dramatically different tastes than Roy Cannaday or Tom Vasal, so you'd end up homogenizing too far with that method too. /shrug"
27097,"Twilight Struggle remains my all time favorite board game.  Kind of shocked to see it ranked so low over a game like Deception, but I get different people have different tastes."
27098,"It's a near perfect two player game in terms of execution, but the theme may put people off."
27099,In general the Dice Tower crowd seems to dictate the top positions. :)
27100,"There may be a lot of them, but I find their range is more diverse than ones like Brawling Brothers for example."
27101,I'm a little surprised Carcassonne isn't on here
27102,"Outside of a few exceptions, this list operates under the assumption that board games weren’t really manufactured before 2015."
27103,"I just watched the SU&SD review for terraforming Mars. They weren’t too terribly kind and their complaints seemed reasonable. On this list that game was \#2, could anyone drop some positives about the game to help me understand what makes it so great or why SU&SD was off the mark?"
27104,"There are a multitude of reasons I love Terraforming Mars. One that I never hear other people mention is how well it organizes and presents the game state. Most card-based engine builders have a problem where it's hard to see what your opponents are doing. But in TfM, you can see most of what a player is doing by looking at the central board or their production boards. Sometimes you need to look at their tags and their blue cards, but even that is relatively easy to see based on the iconography."
27105,"> why SU&SD was off the mark?  

I think the key ""tilt"" that SUSD have relative to many other reviewers is the centrality for them of the question, ""is this game a fun way to interact with my friends?"" ie, not, ""is this game a fantastic puzzle to work out (with my friends nearby also working on a similar puzzle)?"" but, is the game good for *enhancing* the interaction between the people at the table?  

You can see this in how strongly they advocate for **Blood on the Clocktower** or **The King's Dilemma** or **Wavelength** or even **Kakerlaken Poker**. Lightweight or heavyweight, all these games are very interactive.  

Terraforming Mars is kinda multiplayer-solitaire-esque. Lots of people really really like games that fit this description, and there's nothing wrong with this type of design. But these games are never going to get a strong response from the SUSD people because that's not where their focus is."
27106,"Ah, I’m new to the hobby and did not know that SU&SD had preference towards player interaction and against “multiplayer solitaire.” This should be helpful when watching their videos moving forward."
27107,"It’s a fun game. There’s a TON going on near the end game and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. Plus, what your opponents do and have influence what you do, so there’s a fair amount of interaction. Also, it’s a ‘point salad’ game, so you often don’t know who will win until the very end - DRAMA!

There’s a lot of little things wrong with it (I’m looking at you, player boards!), but it’s a good game overall, well worth being on anyone’s game shelf."
27108,"My taste are usually not too far off SUSD but Terraforming Mars is my favorite game. It combines the joy of having a growing engine with lots of crunchy decision. (I believe SUSD did not play with the drafting variant, which is an absolute must for this game and amps up the number of interesting decisions you have to make)"
27109,What is the drafting variant?
27110,"The four cards you get for Research Phase are drafted simultaneously (a la 7 Wonders, Sushi Go, etc). Then you pay for each one you want to keep from the four you've drafted. I think a majority of people use this variant, so I think a lot of people will have played that way not knowing that it is a variant."
27111,"I only play this way now. When you're building towards an engine, non-drafting makes it super difficult. Just feels better when you do it as you're more likely to get relevant cards of course. For anyone who hasn't tried it this way - you won't regret it but it adds a slightly increase in time"
27113,And the relative ease of hate-drafting does lend itself to a lot of friendly shit-talking.
27114,I give a lot of weight to SU&SD reviews but they lean heavily toward games with a lot of “above the table” interaction between players for games. I think that’s why they were so critical of this game. I was skeptical at first too but grabbed the game for pandemic playing and have played it a dozen times already (1 and 2 player)
27115,"I'll give some positives, but keep in mind I don't think SU&SD are wrong, I just don't think it's their type of game.


- Trying to work out which cards you can afford to keep, what your opponents might want from your current draft hand, watching the tracks tick up and trying to figure out if you can pull your plan off this turn ... an awesome little puzzle each round. 

- Narrative: We name our Corporations things like ""Evil Corp."", or ""The Tree Huggers"" and the stories that just organically flow out of the cards you choose to play, if you nuke the planet, etc. lead to some really great memories. 


- Your colony/corp really feels like your own, and unique from the others. Each game can be really different based on card draw/draft, and how each player chooses to approach those cards and the board state.


Watch some positive reviews, then watch the SU&SD one again. Maybe it will change your mind, or maybe you will realize that you were right to trust their impression."
27116,"To present the opposite viewpoint, my group found that it took way too long for what it was - a solid introductory engine builder. There's a few things it does well, drafting and making you pay to keep cards makes the decisions more tense right away for what you hold onto and the directions you build your engine and the shared map creates some tension, but for the time it took for us to play, we can get in a few games of Century or Gizmos or other games that satisfy the same engine-building itch.

I've heard that drafting corporations makes the game better, but it seems to me that it will just add to the play time without enough to make up for the increased length."
27117,"I haven't played with the drafting corporations variant, but I mostly agree with your critique, although I think it's still one of of the best games I own.  It's just not suited for everyone.  Personally, I love and hate Terraforming Mars, here are my thoughts:

Good:

1. Very high replayability.  The combination of different corporations you play, combined with each card being unique, makes the game play different every time.
2. Strong engine building in terms of everything you need to consider, with rarely a clear decision to be made, often a lot of alternatives to consider.  Hyper focused on efficient play.
3. Focus on tactics and adapting to your hand, which can level the playing field between average and novice player.
4. The ""gamble"" of drafting cards in this game is very alluring.  Since each card is unique, it doesn't work like other games where you're hoping to draw a specific card, since the odds of that are so slim.  Each round almost plays out like opening a present and then doing your best with what you're given.

Bad:

1. Terrible components.  It's almost laughable how much they cheaped out here.  A more consistent art style, better components, and better packaging would have done wonders for this game.  Hoping a later edition addresses this issue.
2. At least in my experience, this game can be extremely frustrating come mid/late game if you are not winning, which can sour the experience.  With our group, by the last few generations, there's a clear winner, and there's often little you can do to stop them, as they're already ahead and simply producing more than everyone else, so catching up is nearly impossible. This leaves other players frustrated by the end of the game as they're just watching themselves lose.
3. Your interactions with other players are pretty much entirely sour experiences.  They eliminate some of your resources, you take a spot on the board they were eyeing, they take a milestone on the turn before you were going to claim it.  Lots of exchanging bitter blows.
4. Outside of skilled play through experience, this game can boil down to luck of the draw, especially with a strong opening hand."
27118,"I appreciate your note on the art. That alone is the reason why I don't own a copy. As an elitist graphic designer snob, I find that the component/art/design quality unfairly skews my enjoyment of a game, or lack thereof. 

For example, I love Everdell and Abyss probably a bit more than they deserve!"
27119,"Personally, I love TM's art. It feels very scientific journal-y to me."
27120,"The art is just fine to me too. I feel like they spent all their budget on the gold/silver/bronze tokens, and forgot to spend anything on the rest of the pieces though.

The player mats are awful (god help you if someone ever bumps the board), and I really wish the things that go out on the map itself were more tactile. Just a bit of verticality could make it go a long way toward really feeling like you were terraforming -- especially with cities."
27121,I bought Terraforming Mars and Above & Below on the same day.  We unpackaged both at the same time and our group was dumbfounded how Terraforming Mars was the more expensive of the two.
27122,haha those games are at opposite ends of the spectrum!
27123,"There are so many corporations and so many project cards that you can play it a dozen times and it will still feel (mostly) fresh every time. There are tons of ways to leverage your inherent abilities and starting cards to win. 

It's one of those games where you typically have 3-4 things you can ""almost"" do but can't quite finish them all in your turn so you wait until next turn, when you get another few things you want to do, and repeat. It keeps you engaged all the way through."
27124,I enjoy SU&SD and respect their opinion but remember a lot of the enjoyment of games and similar stuff is subjective. Even if a game has a 1 out of 5 star review or a movie has a terrible RT rating there is no reason you may not love it. Games and other entertainment really is about experiencing it rather than hearing about other's people experience of it. We are so lucky to have SU&SD and Dice Tower etc. but sometimes I worry we spend too much time watching reviews and not enough time playng games lol
27125,"I tend to agree with SU&SD more on this one. Terraforming Mars is, to me, a pretty mediocre engine builder, with a good bit of luck determining who does well. Shut Up and Sit Down has a razor-sharp focus on finding the ""hook"" or the really unique game concept that makes the game a keeper. Terraforming Mars' ""hook"" isn't a mechanic or game element, it is the science-oriented fantasy of slowly carving an entire planet to your will. I think that appeals to a lot of people, including many reviewers, but I think SU&SD would say that the emperor has no clothes."
27127,"I like Terraforming Mars fine, but it shouldn't be ranked nearly as high as it is IMO. 

It's a perfectly fine engine builder game, but with some incredibly glaring flaws. There are just so many other games that deserve it's spot that I can't believe it's so highly considered."
27128,It's my current favorite. The only downside is it's long. Budget 2 hours. But if you like longer games it's great!
27129,"Thanks for making this! Sad there's no 18xx still, but it's unlikely that any would make it on a list like this unless they're lumped together."
27130,I was upset about that too actually. 1889 was very close to making the cut.
27131,"Ooh, really? What rank was it? That's exciting."
27132,"I’ll check a little later. I was also neurotically recalculating tank every time I added a new reviewer, so it’s possible that memory is from when the list was smaller."
27133,"Okay, 1830 would have ranked 129 and 1889 would have ranked 130"
27134,"Wow, what a spread for Spirit Island:

>Ambie Valdés (The Dice Tower) #70  
>  
>Jarrod Carmichael (3 Minute Board Games) #1  
>  
>Steph (3 Minute Board Games) #22  
>  
>Josef Sannholm (Boardgames with Niramas) #8  
>  
>Neilan Naicker (Board Game Barrage) #24  
>  
>Will Keeler (Roll For Crit) #15

Off many lists entirely, but top ten in two & #1 overall for one of them.

Here's a suggestion that might not be possible to implement this year but is worth thinking about for next year: be able to filter out games that made *someone's* \#1 or top 5 or top 10 or whatever. I think a flaw to the list (not necessarily a flaw on your end, simply a flaw of aggregate lists) is that some games just aren't widely reviewed. So the top games are going to be widely reviewed games that are well-regarded. That's not a bad thing at all, but I love SI & it made me think that I'd value games that are highly rated even if not widely reviewed.

Thanks for putting this together & sharing it!"
27135,"Can someone explain to me why Legendary is so high? Do the expansions vastly improve the game. I only have the base set, and it's alright, but feels a little dull."
27136,"The base game is pretty easy, but the expansions definitely help. The old standard was to recommend picking up Dark City (if you could find it) to increase the challenge, but I think Xmen is pretty good bang for the buck as well.

However...none of the expansions really change the basic flow of the game dramatically, so if you don’t see any potential to the base game, I’m not sure it’s worth throwing more money at it. If it wasn’t a Marvel game, I doubt I would have moved beyond the base game, but the IP hooked me."
27137,"War of the ring (2nd edition) number 93


That is what I call an outrage, curse you personal opinions, otherwise good list."
27138,"I feel like if the list were “Favorite Games if you Have a stretch of 10 Hours to Fill,” it would definitely do better! ;)"
27139,"You underestimate me, I’m a philosophy major, I always have ten hours to fill."
27140,"Then if you’re filling it with War of the Ring, you’re filling it properly!  Enjoy!!"
69095,Exactly!
27142,"Asymmetric war games generally under performed on that list, and they're pretty much my favorite games.  War of the Ring, Twilight Struggle, Root, etc."
27143,Any recommendations on this list that doesn’t have to steep of a learning curve?
27144,"What would be steep for you? Here are a few games I think would 5-10 minutes to teach and are quite fun!

&#x200B;

* Takenoko
* Quacks of Quedlinburg
* The Mind
* Azul
* Codenames

Now, there are other games in this list with simple rules but deeper gameplay. Like Concordia which has simple rules but a good amount strategy."
27145,"I'd say Dominion as well,  since the game practically explains itself."
27146,I didn't like playing dominion but I love Ascension
27147,Quacks is the best!
27148,Kind of surprised Ticket to Ride wasn’t on the list
27149,There are a ton of games missing because they were made before youtube reviews existed.
27150,Wow this is amazing thank you
27151,"For folks that wanted the list of designers with a few hits on the list:

2 Top 100's

['S J Macdonald', 'Vital Lacerda', 'Cole Wehrle', 'Jonathan Gilmour', 'Daniele Tascini', 'Wolfgang Warsch', 'Stefan Feld', 'Simone Luciani', 'Rob Daviau', 'Nikki Valens', 'Dávid Turczi', 'Jamey Stegmaier']

3 Top 100's

['Shem Phillips', 'Antoine Bauza', 'Bruno Cathala', 'Martin Wallace', 'Kevin Wilson', 'Eric M. Lang', 'Matt Leacock', 'Corey Konieczka', 'Vlaada Chvátil']

5 Top 100's

['Uwe Rosenberg']"
27152,It's a crime that Reiner Knizia isn't on that list multiple times.
27153,"For real, Tigris and Euphrates is a fantastic game and my friends favorites are Through the Desert and Modern Art"
27154,"This is cool as heck. Thanks for putting this together, I'm really excited to go trough this and evaluate what my next few money-sinkers will be."
27155,Woah. This is neat.
27156,A Feast for Odin is #1? I approve... :)
27157,"Was Christmas gifted AFFO a while back, played it a few times solo, left it at a friend's place and forgot about it.  Should probably pick it back up and give it another go!"
27158,the more you play it the better it gets
27159,"What am I, chopped liver?   [http://www.zenofdesign.com/top-board-games-of-the-decade-2010-2019/](http://www.zenofdesign.com/top-board-games-of-the-decade-2010-2019/)   


(Yes, I realize that I am, in fact, chopped liver)."
27160,"How were the top reviewers determined? I really value SU&SD's reviews & I doubt I'm in the minority. I'm curious why were they excluded

PS This is super neat - kudos!"
27161,"There wasn’t a solid methodology for determining reviewers. I basically included my favorites in this case. In the case of Shut Up & Sit Down, I’m also a fan (and included them last year), but there’s no actual ranked list from them. Matt and Quinns have unranked lists, but including them would have invalidated the methodology used for rank aggregation (see the methodology section of the post)."
27162,"Ah, makes sense. Thanks for the reply!"
27163,"Its crazy to me that Inis is 96, you would think that its a critics darling given its innovativeness and brilliant art."
27164,"Agreed. If you look at the breakdown, it didn’t make it on many list and the ones it did, it didn’t rank as highly as I would have expected:

Sam Healey (The Dice Tower) #57

Luke Hector (The Broken Meeple) #47

Josef Sannholm (Boardgames with Niramas) #46

Neilan Naicker (Board Game Barrage) #13

Kellen Allen Laker (Board Game Barrage) #9"
27165,"I feel like a some of the problem with this list is that some of these reviewers might not have played the game and thus don't have a ranking? Its hard to tell from top 100s.

&#x200B;

Edit: I just realized it was you who made the list, what do you think of that problem?"
27166,"Yeah, but that’s pretty much every list. But also, people should play Inis more xD"
27167,"Also, it’s fairly interesting how similar it is to the BGG ranking in this instance. It’s 104 on BGG."
27168,"I agree, its one of the few war games I can get into. Very interesting choices and decisions."
27169,"Really nice job. Interesting to see somewhat of a mix of game types in there, and less of the weight toward recency that we see on BGG. As a curmudgeon of course I disagree with most of it but not nearly as badly as I disagree with the BGG top 100."
27170,"This is wonderful! What an awesome resource, I particularly appreciate your methodology section providing more clarity on how you arrived that these rankings. Thanks for sharing!"
27171,"Great list! I'm surprised that BattleCON didn't make it, Tom Vasel described it as one of the best games he's played. I absolutely love it and still haven't found a game that I actively crave playing."
27172,"This is simply amazing. Thank you! 

A suggestion (if possible) is to maybe have the filter first show a condensed ""game title"" only with the options of expanding to read the details (Description, amazon link, etc...)? It makes it easier to take a quick glance and just open up the ones you want to read more about rather than scrolling down a lot."
27173,"This is very cool!

It’s a shame seeing Brass Birmingham in the 70’s though. Game is incredible."
27174,"Is Rising Sun really that good? Wonder if I should consider getting it, although, I hate missing all the SG's :("
27175,I have the base game without the SGs and absolutely love it
27176,"Nice to see codenames on here. Not a huge boardgame person, mainly cause my friends never have the attention span. But codenames is super fun casual game."
27177,I support this list because **Robinson Crusoe** is in the top 10
27178,This is a great list.  Gonna have to head over to Amazon once the social distancing stops.
27179,"You know, Amazon might have some on their online store so you don't have to go anywhere."
27180,But hard for anyone to come to their house to actually play. :)
27181,True. 😭
27182,Not seeing Race for the Galaxy is kinda disheartening :(
27183,But Roll is on there
27184,"But Race is better! 

(Full disclosure: I’ve never played Roll)"
27185,"Don't bother lol.  Roll isn't bad, but Race is just so much better.  Every time I played Roll I found myself wishing it was Race."
27186,Catan isn’t even on this list :(
27187,Perhaps the archives are incomplete
27188,"If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!"
27189,"If you dive any deeper into the hobby than Catan you'll find games that do the things you like in Catan, but much better than Catan. It's a great gateway game, to the point where it has honestly replaced Monopoly as being the ubiquitous ""everybody has that game in their closet"" game (which I'm glad about, I actually enjoy Catan as opposed to Monopoly), and it's got great things going for it. But it doesn't belong on a list of the ""top 100 games ever"" from hobby enthusiasts."
27190,Can you suggest any games?
27191,"I can recommend some games, but it'll help if you answer a few questions first. What games have you played before, and which ones did you like? Who would you realistically play the most with? Would you mostly be playing 2 player, 3 player, 4 player, etc? What kind of complexity are you looking for (more than Catan, less, about the same)?"
27192,Sounds like it's probably a pretty good list then.
27193,"Eclipse not even in top 100? No Dixit either? Viticulture #10?

I know these are all subjective preferences, but I really couldn’t disagree more with this aggregation. I’m kind of baffled how terrible I think this list is."
27194,"Man, Root is only #60? I thought it would be top 10 for sure! 

I feel like a scrub"
27195,I think Root would be higher on my personal list if it played well at 2.
27196,2 players?
27197,">2 play

Yeah, sorry if that wasn't clear. It doesn't play well with only two players (the Clockwork expansion/better bot project helps a bit too)."
27198,Yeah it definitely is not a 2 player. I agree 100% with that criticism
27199,Thanks for putting this together! Fascinating to see where my picks rank compared to other reviewers. And to see that I'm not totally insane for some of my choices.
27200,"Great stuff, love the filters. 

Even though I dont understand the math (Arkham horror seems dragged down big time cause one guy put in in his 90 {and I kinda agree with him}) it gets me able to filter down a world of games to a nice little list.  Well done."
27201,This is really interesting. Obviously reviewers have their own tastes (I should know) but seeing so many reviewers aggregated does paint an interesting picture. This just further cements I need to play Feast for Odin
27202,"I'm surprised to see Sid Meiers Civilization at 83. I feel like this game doesnt get talked about enough as a 4x games. It always seems to me that when 4x games gets talked about it is usually Twilight Imperium or Eclipse. 

Civilization is hard to come across these days including the expansions. FFG has even taken down some of their stuff on their website so now there is a 404 error code. I don't think there will ever be a reprint to this game. Maybe a second edition comes out in the future but I doubt it. 

Not only do I enjoy the 4x to this game but I love how you can win in 1 of 4 ways, military, economic, culture, and technology."
27204,"Nice to see **The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire** on the list. One of my top 5-10 games and I don't see it recommended often. Great art and components, and a fun twist on mixed worker placement and tableau/engine building. Plus it's relatively short to play."
27205,Whatever the Fed reserve board members are holding.
27206,Which are? Sorry I’m just a newbie and have no idea how to research the right stuff
27207,Any link/web where we can look it up
27208,ITT: stocks that you should have bought and held for the PAST decade
27209,The comments are about as original as the OP. This same thing gets asked weekly.
27210,Some Redditor’s 10 year investment strategy change ￼from week to week
27211,Long term on Reddit means a couple of months at the longest lol
27212,Ya hot hand fallacy going hard here.
27213,"Target, Microsoft, Square, Thermo Fisher, Disney"
27214,Why target?
27215,"Target has massive brand loyalty, is cheaper relative to other competitors like Walmart, and has made a seemless transition to e-commerce. I also love the CEO and the direction he's taken the company. 

And as an anecdote my wife and nearly every single one of my friends significant others spend a lot of time and money in Target"
27216,Is it anecdotal evidence if everybody has the same anecdote? Every single woman I know goes in for cat food and comes out with $200 less.
27217,Holy fucking shit how fucking big are those goddamned cats
27218,"Pussy is expensive, man."
27219,It's the cat from Sandlot.  You just didn't see it during the movie.  Turns out the old man fed his animals magic growing beans
27220,"Yes, that is still anecdotal"
27221,"Like I said, massive brand loyalty!"
27222,Sad that Target opened in Canada and quickly went bankrupt and closed all their stores.  I loved that place for the few months it was here.
