51326,I haven’t. I typically get the liquid armor.
51327,I’ve been using that particular Spigen since my 6S Plus! It was bulletproof on my XS Max still looked good after almost 3 years I just got bored and went with a cheap hot pink number last winter to avoid new phone envy.
51328,"Another vote for Spigen, been using them for more than 6 years and haven't had a single crack."
51329,"Caudabe MagSafe Sheath. One of my favorite cases, and it comes in black, blue, gray, *and* purple (a lot of folks seem to be really into purple)"
51330,I wish the website had a pic of the purple!
51331,Jay Blue silicon
51332,I love all the colors but couldn't make myself do it and got Apple's black leather case.
51333,Spigen Tough Armor. Saved my xs countless times.
51334,"Did you go Tough Armor or Tough Armor with Mag? Tough Armor looks more protective, but I went with Mag because it’s a feature I don’t want to necessarily write off coming from an XS Max."
51335,"the best cases I found for my 12 pro were the ringke fusion with the matte clear back and the torras clear case, so i’ll get one of each and probably an apple silicone case when I pick up my phone. I tried everything this past year for some reason, 35 cases in total. I have cases from nomad, spigen, casetify, the official apple cases, pitaka mag cases, UAG… and i kept going back to those fucking $15 clear cases"
51336,Has anybody used a clear case that has not scratched or yellowed over time. A lot of manufactures claim so but I haven’t been proven right yet.
51337,"As far as I know all clear (soft) TPU yellows.  The hybrid with a (hard) polycarbonate back mitigate this because the PC doesn’t yellow while the TPU edges will yellow over time.  My solution is to get a case that’s no more than about $12 and just replace it every 6 months or so.

This is one reason Apple’s 12 Pro clear case is such a disaster.  They used materials that apparently don’t yellow but the case is brittle and cracks, it’s uncomfortable, and the buttons are damn near impossible to press.

This time I’m getting graphite so unlike the pacific blue 12 pro, I don’t feel as much need for clear so I may get a caseology Vault which is opaque black."
51338,"As much as I like the idea of a clear case to show off the phone, I never stick with it due to scratches and blemishes."
51339,[Nomad](https://nomadgoods.com/collections/iphone-13-cases) makes some nice products (I have a few) and I’m considering one of their leather cases.  I’m starting out with a trusty inexpensive  spigen liquid crystal for now but may order one.
51340,I've had the leather case the past six months. The leather is peeling from the edges and is stained on the top right. I wouldn't recommend on my experience.
51341,Thanks.  You saved me some money.
51342,Otter box no one?
51343,That's what I was thinking as well. I wonder way so many people choose other cases...
51344,"Over the years I’ve always made a huge deal about the perfect case for me and eventually came to the conclusion that the speck presidio was the ticket. Bought more than I care to count. FYI for any fellow lovers of this series the new version for 13 is not what it once was. They have essentially removed the best part of the case GRIP. The rubber lines across the back have been replaced with empty channels. They seem to have compensated for this with the whole case being in a semi rubberized finish which is an absolute fingerprint magnet and not even very grippy. Quite disappointed to be honest. I went with applecare and an oem apple leather case this time around. If I’m going to drop my phone at least it will look good as it falls and breaks. It’s a real shame, hopefully speck release’s a traditional candy shell or presidio at some point."
51345,Moment case: https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-leather-cases-for-iphone-13-compatible-with-magsafe/-13-pro-indigo
51346,"I wanted this one, but it won’t arrive until a couple weeks after the phone. Ended up getting the Apple Leather Case instead because of that."
51347,Why this one over the apple leather case?
51348,"There were a lot of complaints about the iPhone 12 Apple Leather Case. Reviewers said that it was built differently than previous years with a painted-on surface that flakes away over time. No idea if that’s true, but just figured I’d give Moment a shot. Got the Dark Cherry Apple one yesterday though and it looks beautiful."
51349,I really want a leather case but not sure how I would sanitize/wipe it down.
51350,Unfortunately you really can’t. But that’s kinda a big part of why most people love leather cases. They love the patina and used up look.
51351,Had leather for my two last iPhones but I want to switch back to silicone for that pristine matte look
51352,">https://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-13-pro-max/products/iphone-13-pro-max-case-ultra-hybrid-matte?variant=40045637468207

Apple leather cases do not age well at all. Also, the patina on all the ones I've owned can be wiped off. Still a good case tbh and still what I use."
51353,"Phonerebel gen3, or dbrand grip if they make the magsafe stronger.

I use a magsafe puck to hold it on my car dashboard, and plug it in when i need juice"
51354,Also waiting for PhoneRebel. Spigen in the meantime.
51355,I did the DBrand grip on my XS max and it had some pretty sharp edges around the bottom speaker ports that dug into my pinky real bad. Eventually gave up on it even though I had a limited print skin because I couldn’t keep slicing my pinky.
51356,Mous limitless! Theyre my favorite. Just ordered mine for my pro max a few minutes ago!
51357,I keep hearing that its not as grippy and a bit slippery compared to other brands. Is that true on your end?
51358,"Yes its not very grippy but thats what i like about it because it goes in and out of your pockets so easily, but its also not super smooth either and its so sturdy. I think its just right. Im actually typing this on my 11 pro max with the Mous limitless case on. Waiting on my new phone to upgrade everything :)"
51359,Got the blue silicone case for the Sierra Blue phone just because they match. I want a leather case (I currently use the green leather case with my XS Max and I love the feel) but I'm holding off until I can get to an Apple store to see firsthand how the colors look before deciding on one.
51360,Spigen while I wait for PhoneRebel Gen 3
51361,Been using the Spigen Thin Fit for almost as long as they’ve been making them.
51362,Bought the chalk pink Silicon as well as the Wisteria leather https://i.imgur.com/LbXhj5L.jpg
51363,"Otter box defender case. I literally throw my phone against the wall, works great. Stopped getting AppleCare years ago"
51364,"I wanted to look for a nice thin Sierra Blue case that matches my phone like how I got a nice midnight green for my 11 pro, but struggled to find one. 

Ended up getting this, transparent back matte:

TORRAS Shockproof Compatible for iPhone 13 Pro Max Case, 8 FT Military Drop Protection Translucent Matte Case Slim Fit Compatible for iPhone 13 Pro Max Phone Case 6.7 Inch, Guardian Series, Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0946XSPTB/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_G61AP6FKEGJVYJCDYREE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
51365,Getting an OtterBox defender and a glass screen protector but will probably swap to a Spigen tough armor at some point.
51367,Defender is the big boy
51369,"I use the Commuter - little less bulky than the defender but still provides a lot of protection, also has the port cover.   I also prefer my screen to remain naked."
51370,"I bought this one from Torras, their iPhone 11 case is fantastic (not too slippery, but not a lint magnet either):

https://www.amazon.de/TORRAS-iPhone-Pro-Max-Durchscheinend-black/dp/B096V3671R?ref_=ast_sto_dp

But I’m also going to check out reviews of this one, it looks very nice:

https://uk.tech21.com/products/evo-tactile-iphone-13-pro-max-black"
51371,"Every iPhone since the original I’ve had naked. 

My 13 pro will be naked too, with a Torras screen protector - purely cause I scratched my 12 pro early doors and it irritated me!

Phones feel so much better naked."
51372,They really do. “Why don’t you have a case?” Cause my phone looks and feels better than yours
51373,"""But baby, I just want to truly feel you, we don't need protection between us"""
51374,so it’s an ego thing for you?
51375,"No, I just think phones look better without cases and I have insurance which is $20 to replace a cracked screen"
51376,I’ve always gone caseless but I’d consider one if it had like extra strength MagSafe magnets. Worth the compromise for a stronger MagSafe wallet
51377,Totallee’s new MagSafe case ftw
51378,Apple transparent Magsafe case for that ultimate white ring flex
51379,The quality on this case was abysmal. I bought it for my 12 Pro Max
51380,"Crap, guess I will stick with the standard silicone or leather case then"
51381,"Personally, I found the Apple clear case to be really slippery."
51382,Way too slick. Easy to clean though.
51383,"Agreed with the other poster. Apples clear case isn’t good. It’s bigger than I like, and has a slick feel that makes it hard to hold."
51384,Thanks for letting me know :)
51385,It might not be a bad base if you’re going to wrap it in something.
51386,"Considering they had to make new cases for 13 is there a chance they improved it

I ordered one, and I’m guessing apple has a decent return policy, but I’ll prob grab this spigen mag as a backup incase it’s garbage again?"
51387,I just ordered the spigen version of that case off of eBay for like $23. It has softer plastic on the edges so it’ll be easier to use without the corners cracking.
51388,"That's what I ordered.  The clear one on my 11 Pro Max is just fine, only a minor crack near the bottom from me taking it off to clean it."
51389,"These are excellent as well - but on back order for new phone. Extremely thin, but carbon fiber, too. 

https://www.simplycarbonfiber.com/collections/cases/products/iphone-13-pro-max-case-ghost-series"
51391,"I've only used speck cases since the iphone 4, but I'm getting a mini this year and they're not making the type of case I liked for it. So, maybe otterbox. Got a lot of reviews to watch."
51392,Caudabe Sheath has been my go to case for years now
51393,"I'm doing the Sierra Blue Pro Max, and for the short term, I'm going to try out the Apple MagSafe Silicone Blue Jay case.  I've ordered a Moment MagSafe Indigo case.  1. Because this case has done fantastic on my 12 PM.  2. Because I also sometimes use the Moment lenses with my phone!

I've also got an Otterbox Amplify screen protector on the way.  That, too, has done great in protecting my 12 PM!"
51394,"I'm currently stuck between the speck presidio 2 and the otterbox symmetry, cant decide"
51395,"After the horrible experience I had with iPhone 12 cases from apple (both leather and silicone and clear) I’ll stay away from them for a while. Either corners breaking, case falling of my phone on the corners because of no lip, etc etc. 

Glad people have a ton of options in here. I would love a Phone Rebel case but so far haven’t seen anything for the 13 pro max"
51396,"I've used Spigen armor cases for all of my previous devices (including Android), so I'll be going with that! And as someone else suggested in the comments, buy it from Amazon, and not their website"
51397,The leather cases are actually pretty durable. Personally get the silicone ones though as they’re don’t get stupidly dirty quickly
51398,"I don't really care about aesthetics, so I just go for the toughest case I can find. Usually Otterbox or Mous"
51399,Tech21. Been using them for years and they provide great protection.
51400,"+1 for Tech21, been using them for 6-7 years now.  They're the best!  My Evo Lite is on the way ..."
51401,"I just ordered an Incipio Organicore case. It doesn't cost anymore or look all that different from a plastic case, but it's biodegradable. And apparently has 14 foot drop protection and a lifetime warranty."
51402,I drop phones like a moron. Any recs on a solid sturdy case that doesn’t make my phone look like a brick?
51403,"Pink Silicone, no fucks, Silver 13P. Pumped."
51404,Clover Silicone over Graphite Pro Max
51405,Lifeproof next for my 13 Pro Max
51406,LifeProof Frē
51407,Clear Spigen so I can admire the sierra blue for the first few months. Then probably something super low profile for long term
51408,I'm getting a Dbrand Grip with the teardown skin. My brother has one on his 12PM and a 30 ton excavator passed over his phone and it survived (back completly shattered but it works fine)
51409,"I ordered the Otterbox asymmetry Series+ for my 13 Pro Max which has not yet arrived. The case arrived and the box has a sticker that says “iPhone 2021 X-Large and iPhone 12 Pro Max. It seems they put the sticker on the case being sold for the 12 Pro Max.

Given the thickness increase of the 13PM I wonder if this will fit properly or if I should return this case and find something else specifically designed for the 13PM."
51410,I went with Tech 21 and I’ve used them in the past. Looks good but more importantly fits perfect and has good grip.
51411,Any recommendations for open bottom case?  Swiping up seems better on open bottom than having a lip.
51412,"Personally I don’t like open bottom cases, so I can’t recommend anything."
51413,"AppleCare+, i.e., none. 

Once you go caseless, you’ll never go back. It’s like not having to use a condom in a long-term relationship while on birth control."
51414,Can you explain this in a way a virgin would understand please?
51415,"AppleCare+ is like jerking off when no one is home: you have plenty of time to find the perfect video, can setup wherever you like, and use plenty of your favorite lubricant. 

Without AppleCare+ and a case: you’re sacrificing comfortability to try and make sure no one catches you in the act."
51416,Can you explain this to someone who is anhedonic?
51417,raw-doggin' it
51418,"I’ve always used a case because I’m pretty clumsy and butterfingered. But I also always get AppleCare and all this naked phone talk is making me want to try it. Maybe I’d be more careful with the phone with no case. On the other hand, I ordered the Clover silicone case for my Graphite 13 Pro and I love the color combo. Maybe I’ll just go caseless when I’m around the house."
51419,"Halfway through reading this, I was about to recommend going caseless at home. You can get a feel for the phone without having to worry about destroying it. I’m pretty sure that’s how I got started going naked, but it’s been a minute so I’m not entirely sure. 

Let me know what you think if you end up giving it a try! I’m always curious to hear how people feel about it 😄"
51421,Apple Care +
51422,I narrowed it down to the Spigen Ultra Hybrid. But I can’t decide on the “frost black” or “matte black”. I want the rubbery version for more grip. Can anyone help? Thanks.
51423,I'm having the same dilemma.
51424,I’m getting the black leather case from Apple
51425,"No case, that’s what the Apple care plus no with theft/lost protection is for 🤣

Haven’t used a case of an iPhone for about 3-4 years now."
51426,Gonna go with a Mous Limitless 4.0. Definitely on the pricier side but I like their products
51427,Grippy?
51428,"Please recommend me:  
\- iPhone 13 Pro max wallet case (aka folio) with MagSafe.   
\- Must be capable of horizontal kickstand.  
\- I searched the entire web and couldn't find one with MagSafe + horizontal stand capability."
51429,I think you can make that decision yourself.
51430,I got the clear casemate for my sierra blue pro
51431,I went with the Casology Skyfall and Casologys screen protector just in case. I'm hyped !
51432,Spigen Tough Armor Mag. I was debating between the Tough Armor Regular and the Tough Armor Mag and figured why not.
51433,Magbak case
51434,Pitaka… always ☺️
51435,"I went with Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear for my 13 Pro. I had the clear MagSafe case from Apple and didn’t think it was worth spending $49 again. Plus, I never bought a MagSafe charger."
51436,Just ordered apple clear magsafe case. I don’t want to hide the design of the 13 pro max
51437,You may want to get a better quality clear case. iPhone 12 clear case quality was abysmal
51438,This pretty [blue gear4 case](https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/cases/gear4-battersea-snap-case-iphone-13-pro-max-blue.html)
51439,"Planing on getting a Rhinoshield bumper for day 1 and buying a bullstrap leather case later in the year when they go on sale. 

I’m getting Sierra Blue Pro Max."
51441,Blue OtterBox Aneu Series Case with Magsafe for 13 Pro
51442,Any cases for the 13 pro max where it has the button opened like in my apples silicone 11 pro max case?
51443,UAG   I’ve been using these cases for a long time on a few different iPhones and have never had one break. And I seem to drop them a lot lol. Plus the monarch has a 10 year warranty
51444,Is it slim?
51445,It’s a little bigger than the silicone cases but I don’t think it’s too bulky at all. Check their website they have good pictures of it on there
51447,"I always end up with a leather case, either Apple's official one or one from Bullstrap. They are thin, look good with every outfit, and have decent drop protection. I'll probably be picking up an Apple silicone case for my 12 until they release a leather one next month."
51448,"Silicon is good? I have some doubts with the silicon texture and my pocket, no?"
51449,"I’ve had their silicone ones as well. The silicone is good, it will lose its softness after a while. I haven’t had any issues with it peeling, but I also never drop my phone. My wife has had her silicone cases start to peel after dropping her phone and nicking the case a bit. 

They are harder to get in and out of the pocket (why I like leather), but with Covid I’m not really going anywhere that often so I don’t mind. They are really nice for sweat pants / gym shorts though because I don’t have to worry as much."
51450,"I have my doubts about silicone in the sense that it clings in the pockets, and it catches all the fluff, right? I don't know if you know what I mean. It's the material that's like that from memory, I don't know if it does it for the Apple one."
51451,Oh it will definitely grab everything in your pocket. If you wear a lot of jeans you'll be getting all the lint.
51452,Thanks. So silicon is not the right choice with these specs. :(
51454,Yeah but silicon has some disadvantage like keep the dust and it will be complicated to find his place in the pocket of jeans for example.
51455,"If you are looking for a slim  (and still pretty durable) case, which will feel and look good, go for Pitaka MagEZ. There is no comparison. Nevertheless, nothing compares to the feel of a naked phone. As for screen protector, spigen seems to be the best on the market. Spigen protector + apple care is my personal preference."
51456,And what are your recommendations and Spigen? I’m a safety men but I want a trendy case also.
51457,"Not sure if I understand your question. Anyway, as I said, naked phone + screen protector (Spigen seems to be the best) is my personal preference. That is how I use it on my 11 pro and same as my gf will use it on her 12 pro. Since I took my Pitaka MagEZ off and realized how it feels, I never went back. If you care how it looks and feels in hand and you can afford Applecare, go for it, you will never regret that.

Otherwise, MagEZ case from Pitaka seems to be the best compromise between style and security. Anything thinner does not seem to have any sense as protection and anything thicker will make your phone look like a brick."
51458,"Thanks! Yeah, for sure, I will put a screen protection, but I think it will be safer to add a case (a design case, slim if it possible). So for you the right compromise is the Pitaka?"
51459,"Yes, I would go for Pitaka MagEZ. It also supports MagSafe."
51460,Do you test it? I read some feedback: great design but bad protection if the phone is fallen. Do you confirm it?
51461,"Dropped a few times with my Pitaka and no damage. I would not rely on that though. But if you still want it stylish, there is no better option unless you go caseless. Also, make sure you check Pitaka MagEZ, not Pitaka Air. That one is even thinner and really does not seem to help much."
51462,"Yeah, I see your model. It seems great but some test said the protection for dropping is too light."
51463,You should definitely take a look at Otterbox case. Extreme protection and nice design.
51464,Any recommendation of a specific model? One model seems very similar to Rhinoshield!
51465,Silicone has never stuck on to my jeans in 3 years
51466,So it depends of the silicone?
51467,"I have the apple one it’s epic no peeling no lint looks brand new it looses a bit of softness  after about 2.5 years still good for me and will serve until tomo when my 12 and my new red case comes from apple.

I had it on my 6 also no problems 

My parents have it on their 8s and no problems"
51468,So it is their silicone that is of good quality? Usually the silicone clings in the pockets and above all takes all the dust on it.
51469,Never happened for me
51470,I’ll pm you
51471,Spigen thin fit has been my go to for a long time. Not this year. Is not the same. I also got a clear one from spigen but it just feels cheap. I’m still trying to find a good case. Waiting for the official apple leader. Didn’t like any of the colors of tbe silicone ones they released but they do feel good on the hand and had good quality on my 11
51472,"Silicon case, pretty good in aspect but magnet lint unfortunately. :/"
51473,Interesting my 11 silicon case wasn’t. Thanks!
51474,Seriously? No dust issue?
51475,Nope!
51476,Crazy!
51477,"I got the TORRAS Moonclimber clear case for my 12 pro. It’s a fairly standard case with a built in kickstand for viewing videos. I was looking for something that was cheaper than an actual Apple case, able to show off the new pacific blue coloring, able to provide some decent drop protection, and wouldn’t immediately start to turn yellow. Still don’t have the phone yet, but the case feels sturdy with decent construction"
51478,"Yeah, it’s transparent. Is it slim?"
51479,"It’s not super slim, but not bulky at all. It feels good. Doesn’t take away from the sleek feel, but still feels like it will be able to handle the occasional drop. I definitely didn’t want a big ugly case. I never even drop my phone. Just want to be safe if it ever happens. I’m a cautious person lol"
51480,Exactly the same for me! I want the perfect compromise between trendy and be safe with the case!
51481,"Great minds think alike! This case seemed to meet my needs, at least for now. I kinda want to wait and see how the whole “MagSafe” thing plays out and give third party companies a chance to come up with different versions of it. Mini power banks that ‘snap’ onto the back sounds cool but I’ll wait before jumping on board."
51482,"Yeah for sure! And do you have any feedbacks about other cases? Spigen, Rhinoshield, Apple etc.?"
51483,"I haven’t read too much into the others at this point bc price was the biggest factor right now for me. Also wanted a built in stand for watching videos and options were limited for a good case that has that but still lays flat and without extra bulk. I currently have an iPhone X and I’ve had a Spigen case on it for years. No complaints, they always have solid products"
51484,"Yeah Spigen suit perfectly with all my previous models, but not slim in my opinion."
51485,"Agreed. It doesn’t necessarily feel BIG, but it’s certainly different than how slender the phone feels outside of the case. Hard to find a good middle ground."
51486,Yeah exactly! Very difficult to choose!
51487,"I’m using the apple silicone one atm. Feels really good and very grippy. Have heard some people complaining about the corners peeling of but have had mine for a month and still looks good as new. 

I really don’t think port covers are necessary at all, I would personally just get annoyed by them. I would also definitely stay away from the apple clear case. It looks really bad with the MagSafe magnets showing, is very slippery and the plastic buttons are very hard to use. Not to mention it feels very cheap. IMO the worst case apple have ever produced."
51488,"The clear case is awful. Buttons are hard to push and the case is slippery. Silicone cases are good and comfortable. I prefer the leather cases. Feels great in your hand, color is rich, and the buttons are fantastic. Mason makes a good thin clear case but it’s minimal protection."
51490,Yes they do
51491,literally the most annoying case in existence. The leather case was a nice upgrade.
51492,"Saddle brown leather case ever since the iPhone 7. It feels perfect in the hand, protects from every waist height fall I’ve taken them through, and ages beautifully."
51493,"I’m using the pro max black leather case from Apple. Really nice feel in the hand, unfortunately someone knocked my phone from my hand on day 3, no damage to the phone but the corner to my leather case was scuffed"
51494,I’m using the spigen clear case and screen protector for my 12 pro max. I like them!
51495,"I just buy AppleCare+ and enjoy my iPhone the way it was designed. If you don’t want to buy AppleCare+ or you don’t mind using a case, I would buy an official one as they always felt better than other ones."
51496,I finally made the decision to do this when I bought the 12 pro gold. Don’t regret it. What’s the point of having this great looking phone just to put it in a case. Gold
51497,"The depressed idiots who think they’re clever workaround this by using a clear case. It always ends up looking like a man child babying his expensive toy he saved up 4 years to buy, with a cheap gummy covering"
51498,Someone’s butthurt lol
51500,😂 I got a warranty on mine so I can trade in as many times as I want so I’m covered
51501,I tried to do the same thing with AppleCare/no case... cause I thought this was the best way. But these newest phones are slippery. I found myself gripping my device more tightly than I’d like to during normal usage. My hand started to hurt and I ultimately bought an Apple silicon case and my hand pain went away since the case made it more “sticky” in my hand.
51503,"Otterbox symmetry, sleek and feels protected."
51504,How do the buttons feel with the symmetry? I had one for my 8+ and the buttons were super hard to press
51505,They are actually very easy to press. Like as if the case didnt exist. I sometimes accidentally press the power all the time.
51506,MagSafe silicone on ipm 12 and California poppy leather case and wallet
51508,"This might be true when comparing to apples official cases, since you pay a premium for the apple logo. But there is definitely a difference between a $5 case and a $20 when it comes to materials and protection."
51509,"Black leather case here, it’s great."
51510,"Official Apple Leather Case (in black) on my graphite iPhone 12 Pro Max.

I used to use the black one for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and decided it was worth a shot again since the thing never shows signs of aging (in my use case). Most colored leather ends up fading to a much darker color anyways and ends up looking bad (except for the saddle brown, that thing ages like fine wine as it darkens), but the fading doesn’t even show up on the black, so it always looks pretty new. Plus it feels super soft yet somehow grippy.

It’s great."
51511,"When I got my 11 Pro Max, I ordered about 15 cases so I could try them all and keep the winner. I ended up with the ESR Kickstand case and love it. The kickstand is so useful and the little hump on the back means I always know which end is up.  I’ve dropped it a few times and never had any damage.

When I got the 12 Pro Max, I went straight for the new ESR kickstand and am still very happy with it."
51512,"Currently Using *(12 Pro)*: Apple Silicon

Used Previously *(11 Pro)*: Apple Clear, Mous Clarity, 15:21 Cork

**Opinion:** I'd absolutely recommend the Mous Clarity and the 15:21 case to anyone.  For OP specifically, the Mous will offer you protection and visible iPhone color.  It has contoured bezels near the middle to make handling better(won't feel so big in hand).

**Mous Clarity**  
*5/5 Protection*

**15:21**  
*1/5 Protection*  
[https://1521store.com/collections/retail](https://1521store.com/collections/retail)

I used this case for approximately one year on my 11 Pro.  I dropped it numerous times with no issues.  From my own experience,  I think the asking price is 100% worth it.  The case feels well made, easy to handle without feeling like a bar of soap.

Good luck, OP!  Let me know what you think :)"
51513,Thanks for those two recommendations :)
51514,"I just recently got the 12 Pro.  I’ve been using one of the clear, $5 onn. cases from Walmart.  I originally got this case with the intention of picking out a better one soon after, but I’m pleasantly surprised with the onn. case.  I’ve had it (and the phone) for about a month and it’s protected me from a couple of minor drops here and there.

My only criticism is that it doesn’t have official MagSafe support (no magnets built into the case).  That’s a non-issue for me because I don’t currently have any MagSafe accessories, but I can definitely see where it may be off-putting to potential buyers.

Edit: for anybody with the Otterbox Figura for the 12, how does it compare to the Apple silicone cases?"
51515,"I have AppleCare+ on my 12 Pro Max, so I don't use a case while at home, but I still have cases for when I'm not.

I'm currently using an Apple Silicone case because I got it as a Christmas gift. I like the feel of it, and would recommend it. It does tend to grab every single piece of lint it comes into contact with though, especially with jeans.

I also have a Caudabe Sheath. These are my overall favorite cases. I used one on my old iPhoneX as well. Great protection and feel with minimum bulk. The feel of a button press is slightly mushy to me, but it's not that bad. I get more satisfactory feedback on a button press from the Apple Silicone case."
51516,The phone rebel case
51517,I have a clear Smartish case on my 11 Pro. It’s great. Prior to that I used a black Silk case on my 7 Plus. Silk is the predecessor company to Smartish. I’ve really enjoyed these cases. Highly recommended by Wirecutter.
51518,"Hey OP, I know this post is a few days old. But if you like the slimness of the phone and only care about protecting against small nicks and a scratches, I would recommend the Peel / MNML / other super slim cases out there. It feels as if they're not there & you avoid the extra bulk that'd be added to the phone."
51519,"I use a clear Spigen one. My XR is a lovely shade of red, so I like to show it off."
51520,"I will always recommend the [mous case](https://www.mous.co/collections/phone-cases) to anyone that asks. (No referral links, I dont get paid at all for this)

I’ve been buying these cases ever since I got my iPhone 7.

Dropped my 11 Pro Max from 6 ft onto concrete face down more times than I’d like to admit, and on the corner a similar number of times. 

My phone and my case look the same as the day i got it. 

It’s even been slid across concrete and looking at it, you can’t tell at all.

Seriously, don’t take my word for it. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/ofkvQFsXUTc) that sold me on it when I bought my first mous case. (Skip to 4:00 if you want to see the good stuff)

Here’s [my phone](https://imgur.com/a/BhbLp5c/) that I’ve had since release day."
51521,"I can’t recommend rhinoshield from evolutivelabs, enough! They make insanely good screen protectors and cases. Been using them for years and haven’t had any issues. Very customizable too."
51522,Can’t recommend?
51523,"Can’t recommend enough, lol sorry"
51524,"I use a transpartant color case daily, it allows me to charge wireless. 

And I have a wallet case for when i'm going to a festival or something like that. 

&#x200B;

Overall Spigen is my favorite."
51525,"Spigen clear cases are the shit. It doesn't add much thickness to the iPhone SE, and I've dropped my phone a couple of times with no damage."
51526,Didn't it yellow after a while?  Almost every review of a clear case that isn't a rigid case talks about it yellowing or browning after a couple months.
51527,"Yes, the totally clear one yellowed on the sides after a couple of months. But I have one that's black around the edges now (my iPhone SE is black as well, so it blends seamlessly), and I haven't had that issue. Just don't buy the totally clear one. The black one is still clear on the back for maximum brand visibility and dick measuring.

A Spigen case + screen protector is boss."
51528,"The ones I've owned over the years: Pitaka Pro, Spigen, Speck, Otterbox.

I like Apple Leather case but I wouldn't consider that ""protective"" like the others."
51529,"I like Apple Silicone Case, for example [NewCaseShopStudio](https://www.etsy.com/listing/600500761/vintage-mix-tape-iphone-6s-case-iphone-6?ref=shop_home_feat_1)"
51530,Spigen & Rhinoshield
51531,Rhinoshield Mod NX + back & front impact screen protectors.
51532,Apples own leather cases. I am waiting for the Mous Clarity to be released.
51533,"Caudabe Sheath.  Slimmest case that actually offers 6.6' drop protection.  Very slim and very grippy, without sticking in your pocket like silicone.  I tried a bunch of cases, and this and the Slik Kung-fu Grip are the only two I kept.  I use the Slik at my dirty shop because it's even grippier and has a bit more protection."
51534,The ones that apple makes.
51535,"Otterbox defender series. My X currently has it and a Zagg shield on it. I've had the defender on all my iPhones (4s, 5s, 6S plus) and I've never broken a phone.

The Zagg shield saved my x too when I dropped it. Saved my screen :)"
51536,I would recommend a charging case tell me what model you have and I can tell you what kind I think will work best with it. I just got a new iPhone and always have used battery cases. Not only are they thin but they last long and use lighting connections for charge and display output.
51537,I really like Speck cases. Good looking and very protective.
51538,I like the feel of catalyst cases. Specially with the clear back
51539,"Caudabe makes quality cases and I’ve used them on two iPhones. The Sheath protected my 6s very well while maintaining a slim profile and so far this Lucid clear case for my Max is wonderful. So clear, so slim and such a good fit. Their customer service is excellent too."
51540,"I have stopped using casings, and just use protective screens on the back and front. 
That way, the phones design doesn’t get hidden away, and my phone are protected."
51541,What do you recommend?
51542,"I have been using baseus, and have been very satisfied with them. 

[check here](http://www.baseus.com.au/shop/screen-protectors/iphone-x-screen-protectors/baseus-3d-round-curved-edge-screen-protector-for-iphone-8-full-cover-frontback-tempered-glass/)"
51543,do they protect the edges as well?
51544,"I haven’t had any problems with broken edges. And I have so far changed three times, because the back got broken."
51545,"Only apple silicone, leather and UAG cases are worth buying thank me later"
51547,Their silicon cases are actually quite good. Have survived the unfortunate drops that happen over the course of the life of the phone.
51549,"Yeah they still begin to peel and flake, but in my experience longer than a few months, maybe half a year or a bit less? Had one for just under a year now and it’s still mostly intact though."
51550,"That’s about what mine was. Only lasted about 4 months before that started happening. What was worse with mine is after about a month or two, it got greasy and sticky. I avoid them now because of it. Could’ve been me, I have fairly oily skin, but it was just really gross"
51551,I can agree with that
51552,I don’t use the Apple cases as I feel they don’t offer enough protection and I don’t trust myself enough. When it comes to my watch I wouldn’t consider anything but straight from Apple though.
51553,Spigen ultra hybrid with the black edges and clear back
51554,Doing this as well and pairing it with their screen protector.
51555,Does this fit well with the EZ ones?
51556,Spigen Liquid Air all the way!
51557,Never used Spigen but buying this one rn!
51558,Same. I ordered mine off eBay last night
51559,"Can confirm this case SLAPS! I’ve had one on my last three phones and ordered one for my 11 Pro. I beat on my phones and use them as a tool. Regularly getting covered in motor oil and geese, paint, dropped from ladders. The case always cleans right up. Insane value for a $15 case."
51560,Been using this case since my iPhone 7 Plus. Solid cases
51561,Yup got the all clear one with the minty looking 11. Wanted purple but the homies woulda roasted. 😂😂😂
51562,I’d love this case if I can stop myself from trying to remove dust particles from inside the case every two hours.
51563,Is the one with black edges listed as matte black on amazon? I’m not too familiar with this brand and I don’t want to end up ordering an all black case.
51565,"I've had one of these. Looked ace, but terrible for fingerprints."
51566,Do you get the spigen glass screen protector?
51567,I’m getting this one too. That case has been my go-to case for my last three iPhones and I love it.
51568,Same here. It’ll look nice on the midnight green!
51569,"Incipio Dual Pro for me, I've trusted it on every iPhone I've owned!"
51570,"As always, Apple leather phone case"
51571,I’m hoping I like mine
51572,"You’ll love it. Although saddle brown has a natural patina on leather, your black is going to be fine."
51573,This is actually the midnight blue. I think the white background made it look more black
51574,my iPhone X midnight blue aged way more gracefully than my 6s saddle brown. the latter looks fresh out the box but after two years was very dark.
51575,"I think you will.  I always buy an Apple leather case when I get a new iPhone. They look great and have a very good, solid feel in the hand.

My forest green leather case for my new 11 Pro Max in green should be arriving by Wednesday, in time for my iPhone’s arrival on Friday."
51576,"I love mine! Only problem is I find they get messed up. I had one on my 6 and I kind of just impulse bought one for my 8 because I hate thick cases like the otterbox that was given to me wit the phone, if this one is like my old one I might buy a nomad one when I upgrade. But regardless they offer decent protection with nice clean looks and feel awesome in the hand"
51577,The Nomad leather one is not worth it. Mine fell apart and start peeling within in month. Just a heads up if you were looking at the leather case.
51578,I love them but the no bottom protection puts me off
51579,I’ve had every one since they came out. I have yet to ding up the bottom of a phone
51580,"well I managed to ding the bottom of my last 2 iPhones while a bulky case on it, so YMMV"
51581,"I wanted to get the clear one from the Apple Store, but they're out of stock til the 2nd near me and I don't think I wanna risk no case for that long lol."
51582,Just get it online lol. I wanted the apple Leather but they said it wouldn’t be in the store til November lmao. So I bought it online and it’ll be here Thursday
51583,Earliest on that is the 26th for the clear. The other suggestion of going through the carrier seems to be the better option. Verizon has the clear Apple case for $30 right now too instead of the $40 they charge at the apple store.
51584,"Ordered an Apple clear case from Verizon on Saturday, and the ETA is Tuesday.  Even if it slips a day or two, it should arrive by Friday."
51585,Bestbuy has them. I ordered one and it is being delivered by Thursday.
51586,"If the phone is not ""slippery"" as X , with that new matte finish, i will go naked.. if it is, i will probably get this one."
51587,Yeah that is where I am at
51588,"i sure hope it ""feels"" better then X. i kinda dont like cases TBH."
70215,Amen
51590,"Mous Limitless 3.0, they seem to have been great for previous models and work well with the magnetic car mount and wireless chargers as well as providing good protection for a clumsy person like me."
51591,"Bought first mous two years ago, never looked back. So good."
51592,I’m thinking of getting the Spigen Ultra Hybrid so I can still enjoy the matte green back.
51593,I ordered the one with the matte black edges.   That way the green really pops as green.   At least that’s my plan.
51594,What’s difference between ultra hybrid and liquid crystal? FYI Spigen is selling both on eBay right now for Ten bucks shipped.
51595,"The ultra hybrid has the black bumper and the other one is completely clear, as far as I know."
51596,Black silicon ( iPhone 11 )
51597,"My Apple black leather case was delivered yesterday, it’s always my first choice but if the Pro’s back feels nice I may consider going case less when not in work."
51598,"[Here’s mine](https://imgur.com/a/qmK29B0) TOZO thin case, pitaka mag case and Apple leather case"
51599,iPhone 11 Clear case.
51600,"Anyone have experience with the Apple clear case?  Does it hold up well?  I got a midnight green 11 pro, I’m thinking of using a clear case to start.  Then maybe the Apple green leather case later one."
51601,They feel good. But they degrade like hell.
51602,Always Apple leather https://i.imgur.com/IY97W79.jpg
51603,I like that yello
51604,Curious what it’ll look like in six months.
51605,Brown
51606,This guy convinced me to try the yellow. 🤞🏼it ages well.
51607,That yellow is brand new.
51608,How is the orange and saddle (?) so pristine? It’s got no patina lol
51609,"The saddle is actually really disgusting. If I had another one to compare it to for a photo you’d be able to tell. 

The orange is only a few months old and I’ve been spending a lot of the summer hiking and camping so the smart battery case has been my primary case. 

The smaller orange is also super disgusting, but hard to see without a comparison."
51610,Got the yellow. Love it. Thank you buddy
51611,"I purchased the Black Leather Folio, the Midnight Blue Leather Case, and a Speck Presidio Grip Coastal Blue/Black case. Going to see which one I like best. Really wish Apple would offer the Leather Folio in Midnight Blue."
51612,How is the folio? Thinking about buying one. Did you get it for the Pro Max? I would be possibly interested in buying yours if you could swing it.
51613,CASETiFY clear case with some cheetah print :) and some glass screen protectors from Amazon.  I haven’t purchased AppleCare for my last two phones and frankly never needed it for the past decade. Decent case and screen protectors have kept my phones in almost new condition even though I drop them almost daily. Plus I actually like the grippy feel and looks of the cases I pick.
51614,I was wondering about these because they’re soooo cute and seem to be protective. I drop my phone HARD and often... do you think it holds up?
51615,I’m a daily phone dropper and it’s held up great so far. Feels really sturdy without being bulky. And it’s cute. I’m in love. I still use a glass screen protector on the front though.
51616,"11 Pro Max Otter Box Symmetry case. And if they have them out in November, the Star Wars edition cases. Last years Xs Max symmetry Star Wars cases were awesome.

Edit: replaced commuter with symmetry. Symmetry is the one piece case. And it’s the Symmetry Galactic collection that features a Star Wars decal on the back."
51617,I have one of the symmetry Star Wars cases and I’m genuinely sad I’ll have to stop using it when my new phone comes in - it’s gorgeous.
51618,They are. I so wanted the R2-D2 one giving the message. But no lie they are all fucking sick! Bobba’s is sweet and so is the all white Storm Troopers one and the 2 different styled Vader ones. Really hope they have a collection for the 11 pro.
51619,Apple Leather Midnight Blue for 11 Pro. I’ve been rocking the same color for my iPhone 8 the last two years.
51620,NOMAD rugged for iPhone 11 - had an Apple red leather for my XS max and it’s got this dirty looking gradient  on it.
51621,I ordered a cheap Spigen clear case on amazon ($14 and the one I got last year was great) and I’ll probably get a green Apple leather to go with my midnight green Max. I always love the Apple leather cases
51622,I got the same case. it arrived today.
51623,"Apple leather forest green with midnight green Pro Max. 
5 days to find out how they match 😉"
51624,"Otterbox Symmetry, nothing special just damn good at what it’s supposed to do."
51625,"Scrolled down way too much to find this. I used to hate Otterbox because all of their cases were freakin huge. But then I found the Symmetry cases. They offer some good protection while keeping the phone thin and light. Love mine for the XR. 

I actually had my wife pick out one for her new 11. Should be here right after she gets her phone in another week."
51626,"I had one of them for my 7+, I just found it a bit too bulky"
51627,Simply Carbon Fiber Ghost Case
51628,Honestly I always buy cheap cases from Walmart or TJ Maxx and they always work for me 😀
51629,"Ringke fusion clear case, with the Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit screen protector!"
51630,I actually bought a pink turtle Pela case. I had one for my current phone (iPhone 8 Plus) and it was great! Feels really nice and not stiff like you’d expect a biodegradable case to feel. Very excited to get my new 11 Pro Max Friday!
51631,Caudabe Sheath
51632,I went with the Nomad Rugged black leather case made from Horween leather. Great company with quality products. It will match my airpods case nicely.
51633,100% caudabe sheath. Best cases on the market.
51634,Urban armor gear pathfinder series. I just love their cases
51635,UAG Monarch here for me on my XR and on my 7. UAG makes great cases! How's the pathfinder?
51636,Love it! Honestly it’s my favorite from them. It’s super thin but keeps it protected well! Fits will in the hand too!
51637,Caseology Skyfall and Caseology parallax
51638,"UAG cases are great. I recommend their Monarch, pathfinder, and plasma cases!"
51639,Official Apple saddle brown leather case for the 11 pro. The case just got delivered today.
