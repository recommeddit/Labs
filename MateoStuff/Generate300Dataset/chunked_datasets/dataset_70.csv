22280,"Probably [Christopher Lee](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/gallery/2002/10/29/saruman3.jpg), followed by [Kate Humble](http://www.capitalwoodlands.org/images/131/Kate_Humble__Aigle_02_copy_large.jpg) (a UK TV presenter)"
22282,"!!!! This is great to know! I love her music. That's awesome, I'm very jealous of you."
22283,"Sally Struthers probably. She's a total sweetheart and her and I got along really well last Summer. I'll be seeing her again soon.
Also, Bush Sr. was a pretty cool guy, but that was about it. 
And Caroline Rhea was absolutely hilarious.

Richard Kind has to be the most annoying mother fucker I have ever met in my whole life.

EDIT: I have also met Charles Shaughnessy, Christian Hoff, Rachel York, Stefanie Powers, Carson Kressley, Rex Smith, Georgia Engel, Lorenzo Lamas, Cady Huffman, and Jen Cody. Ah, the benefits of working in a musical theater."
22284,Joel McHale.  Saw him in Seattle the day after Thanksgiving a few years ago.  Didn't chat for long but got a picture with him and my friends.  He was totally game and even posed for goofy pictures.
22285,"I have met [Kid Rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock) a few times. Super down to earth and a really cool guy.

Ive met a couple other celebrities in my time doing theater management but Kid Rock was the coolest."
22286,"I have often had to defend my love of Kid Rock and his music to friends and co-workers who's best argument is ""he just looks so nasty and sleazy"". I often point to things he has done and said that seem to suggest that he is a down to earth , ""good"" person. I am glad a few people can share the sentiment and at least one redditor can attest to the fact."
22287,I thought he was nasty and sleazy until I saw him with Pam Anderson while they were dating. She had him beat by ten fold. Bazinga!
22288,Well played cardboardphone....I think Pam Anderson could make Larry Flint look like a goddamned knight by comparison.
22289,"I actually saw Jared Leto, too, at Hard Haunted Mansion last year.  He was somewhat ""out of it"" haha and didn't really say anything, but he wasn't mean or anything, just kind of in his own world. 

I met some celebrities when I worked for the ticket office in college.  Matt Groening was extremely friendly, and was really happy when I was (lamely) praising of Futurama (and Simpsons) haha.  He had to sign something when he picked up his ticket from me at the will call, and I was considering taking it as a memento, but didn't for some reason...  Also, John Lithgow was nice, too, and so was David Sedaris."
22290,"I met Penn and Teller. They were really nice.
Talked with Teller for a few seconds while I got an autograph from him."
22291,TELLER CAN TALK?! You have blown my mind.
22292,Bruce Campbell almost knocked me over once.  I was honored.
22293,Bethenny Frankel was the sweetest celeb I've met.
22294,Adam Sandler.
22295,Forrest Whitaker
22296,"I met [Kid Rock](http://imgur.com/T92uH.jpg) at Coyote Ugly in Las Vegas...I spotted him, gave him the universal what are you drinking sign, he holds up a bud light, and a buddy of mine buys us a round of bud lights and shots and we head over to him. At this point he has just entered the place by a back door and has a security guard right beside him. We get within 5 feet of him and he motions his body guard to stand down as he looked ready to pick my ass up and toss me onto the casino lobby floor. Then we give him the beer and take a shot with him, and just bullshit...with Kid Rock...We talk about the girls dancing on the bar and just whatever. He was really laid back, down to earth guy which I never expected...and was nice enough to take a picture with us. After this his presence has become known to the entire place and we end up heading on to the next bar. Cool guy indeed though."
22297,Terry Gilliam.
22298,"So I was on vacation in Atlantis, Bahamas. And me and my cousin were at the teen club(cut me some slack, we were 16 and met ladies) when I hear kids freaking out.

The twins from Suite Life of Zach and Cody were there for a publicity thing and came to the club that night. There was an area in this club with video games and at one point they both sat down to play some Super Smash Bros. Melee with a large Bahamian guy hovering over them. I noticed an extra controller that no one went for because they were so enthralled and figured, ""what the hell...""

They both came at me, ignoring each other. It was a stock match and I ended up taking one twin out while losing to the other.

All in all, contrary to the show, the douchey one on screen was really nice and chill. The nice one onscreen was a jerkoff to people."
22299,"Henry Winkler, the last living icon of American cool."
22300,"I met Jared Leto too! Although i didn't recognize him at the time because he had a pink mohawk. He was riding a bicycle and rode right up to me. We chatted, and he introduced himself like he was not super fine (""Nice to meet you, my name is jared!""). He even gave me free tickets to the show that night!"
22301,"I met lights, she was super cool and very nice. She even posed for a picture with me! 

http://imgur.com/L5XTz.jpg

for those of you who do not know who she is here is one of her music videos

22302,There seems to be an elephant in the room. ahem... Keanu
22303,"I met Bill Murray at a Sam's Club. He was very nice and down to earth.

Not much of a celebrity but I met Matt Pinfield (bald guy from MTV's 120 minutes) when I was working at a 7-11 he was super nice and was going to check out some local bands I recommended."
22305,Stewie Griffin...great guy.
22306,"I met Howie Long a few times (he has a house around here and his kids went to school here).  The first time was at the movie theater where i worked at the time.  The second was when i worked at the local Blockbuster.  He came in, looked around for a little bit, then came up with the (his) DVD of Firestorm.  He's a tall guy!  Cool as hell, too."
22307,"Bob Ritchie (Kid Rock).

Loves his kid. Loves his town, loves his country. One of the most honest, down to earth people I know."
22308,"Shaq. My brother was living in Orlando in 1995 and I came to visit for the summer. At that time Shaq was playing for the Magic. We ran into him twice while stopped in traffic. Both times my brother, being the cornball that he is, beeped and started waving like crazy. I was so embarrased, but Shaq also beeped and started waving with a big smile on his face. Both times. From the way he reacted, you'd think we were the celebrities. 

By the way, he was driving a full size Chevy Suburban and it looked like he was sitting in the back seat. The guy was astoundingly huge."
22309,"Johnny Cummings (AKA Johnny Ramone).  I met him and his wife when they came to take a tour of my lab (they were contributors.)  He was incredibly nice and was really interested in the work we were doing.  His wife, who is a serious animal rights person, was not only nice but incredibly understanding about the emotional difficulty of the work I was doing (cancer research in mice.)  They were a lovely couple and I truly mourned Johnny's passing."
22310,"Brad Pitt, without a doubt.  I have a job where I run across famous people with some regularity, and he was one of the few that was really and truly warm and genuine."
22311,"Avril Lavigne. Gave me a hug, because I told her it was my birthday."
22312,"Met Alton Brown at a book signing, one of the cooler celebrities I've met."
22313,"I drank PABST Blue Ribbon and smoked weed with Jackson Rathbone.

He is known for being: ""Jasper Whitlock"" from the world sensation...

**TWILIGHT** 


**EDIT:** Picture:  http://imgur.com/tMOO9.jpg   he is the one in the red bandanna, and glasses."
22314,"I am so jealous. You sir, are a lucky bastard."
22315,"Alright, I am not really into the Twilight movies, but that man is gorgeous. I would probably watch the whole series just for him. You are very lucky."
22316,Sparks!  The drink that gets you drunk and hypes you up!
22317,"Billy Ray Cyrus. I just met him Monday while working as a production assistant on Miley Cyrus' new music video. He was super nice, and talked to me and another guy for a couple of minutes - thanked us for helping out, ect. He had the coolest looking German Shepherd on set."
22318,"I was flying out of San Francisco and Mickey Rooney was on the flight.  He was in town doing Wizard of Oz.  Anyway, he pretty much did an entire Vegas lounge act from the front of the cabin."
22321,"This needs to be higher up... People like to make fun of his persona, but he uses what he has to truly help others!"
22322,"Flava Flav ate at the restaurant I work at once, he made a huge deal about having to sit somewhere private because he didn’t want any attention. When it came to pay his bill? He tried to pay with a pre paid visa that did not have enough money on it...

Edit:Spelling"
22323,Sounds pretty on-brand.
22324,"All of these were waiting tables:

Waited on Gene Wilder for his birthday years ago, he was incredibly nice and laughed so hard he cried when I told him we had “everlasting pistachio” ice cream.

Betty White was hilarious and tipsy after wine and would not stop flirting. If I had been 60 years older...

NPH was also gracious as humanly possibly, insisted we have a drink with his table while we waited on him, and tipped like a champ.

Seth MacFarlane was amazing. Drew me an original cartoon and signed it there at the table. After paying and tipping 100% he refused to let me buy him a shot of whiskey and instead bought me one, then invited us to meet him out later."
22325,Samuel L. Jackson at the Calgary stampede in Canada. He was super nice. My family went up for it because my uncle is part of the committee that organizes the stampede every year and he got us VIP seating. I was a kid at the time and I was like does your wallet really say OBAMF? He laughed and said he left that one at home. Of course when I told the story at school I told everyone his wallet did in fact say that.
22326,"I met Vin Diesel at a truck stop diner when I was a kid.  


It was like 4 in the morning and me, my grandpa and vin and his friend were the only ones in the diner, and we ended up getting sat at the table next to them. 

Vin and a friend were getting ready to go on some fishing trip which was made obvious by the clothes they were wearing. My grandpa struck up a conversation about fishing with him, completely oblivious to who he was. He was a really nice guy and apparently knew a great deal about fishing techniques. 


I was a bit geeked out and didn’t say much or contribute to the conversation but I spent the next hour of our road trip explaining to my grandpa who vin diesel was and why it was a huge deal we just met him."
22327,I bet for Vin it was probably refreshing to have a casual conversation with someone about a personal hobby that didn't center around his celebrity status.
22328,"""THAT GUY DOES MOVIES, GRANDPA""

""Shh, did you remember what he said what type of bait is best for..."""
22329,"Met Dave Chappelle a few years back. Long story short, a friend of a friend got me and two friends into an after party. We were sitting at the bar when his manager offered us some shots. We talked with his manager for a while. Then Dave sat down near us. Dave was kind of sitting by himself and he looks over at us and goes “What’s going on fellas?” And we talk to him for about an hour. We thanked him for coming to our town, talked about music, sports, all kinds of stuff. Super cool dude. One of my favorite memories."
22330,"Dude! To cement that Dave is a cool ass mf, my friends and I were at his Chicago show when he was supposed to film a special for (HBO?) and it was on my actual birthday. The venue was pretty intimate and only had a few chairs surrounding the stage with everyone else standing. We got there early enough to be one of the first row standing.

Right after the opening act he came out and immediately noticed us and asked if we were all Filipinos.  Well, he definitely guessed right! He started talking about how we are his family and went right into the details about his family. the food, culture and his own family. Like having a humorous conversation during his set. Pretty surreal.

Anyways after a killer show, everyone was filtering out when one of the producers stopped us and asked if we can be in some of the B roll footage along with Katt Williams since he was also there checking out the show. Of course, we agreed and sat next to him.

As soon as it was over,  Dave was on stage smoking a joint and I told him it was my birthday that night. He asked what my name is, I said, amour-y-moi! He then grabbed the microphone and with everyone else still around he said, ""Today's Amour-y-moi's birthday and I'm buying shots for everyone!!"". Got to do a shot with him. One of the best random birthday moments ever!"
22331,"What going on fellas?

I read that in his voice."
22332,It’s impossible not to.
22333,"I served Daniel Radcliffe his dessert at an event, and tripped and spilled some of it on him, probably due to seeing that I was serving Daniel Radcliffe, and he stood up and started apologising profusely to ME. Was very sweet and asking if I was ok."
22334,"The correct British response! I like
How fame never seemed to Give him a big head"
22335,"From what I understand, fame almost *destroyed* him.  The stress of being 'Harry Potter' (and the uncertainty as the film series ended) contributed to a fairly serious drinking problem.

I was happy to learn that he's been sober since 2010.  More power to him!"
22336,"He is a really strong person, seriously. So many child stars fall prey to the dreaded ""child star syndrome"" and go off the rails HARD once their big break roles end, but he really overcame it and has blossomed since. 100% one of my most respected actors, in my book."
22337,"It's mostly due to his parents, who never allowed his child fame to grow into his head and never gave him special treatment.

One of my favorite stories of him is, when he won the audition for Harry Potter way back when, his parents awarded him by letting him watch TV for an hour more past his bedtime."
22338,"My husband and I were wandering around Philly a few years ago and Don Cheadle was walking toward us. We both stopped and turned as we watched him go by. After he passed us he turned around with a big smile and waved/winked. 

I just thought that was pretty cool."
22339,"went with my parents to a function for some charity group and we shared a table with Ice-T. Super nice guy, down to earth and not high on himself. He has a mouth on him but when he found out my Dad is a retired preacher never heard a bad word again the rest of the night. I ended up talking music and how he goes from Rap to Metal. Man is cool and knows his sh\*t about the metal and Punk scene."
22340,"When I was a teenager, I met Neil Armstrong at a retirement ceremony that my dad brought me to.  It was at a museum and it was a private event.  There was time for everyone to wander the museum, and my dad saw Mr. Armstrong looking at one of the planes that my dad helped design. Nobody else around.  They struck up a conversation and Neil asked me questions about what I was studying and how I felt about the work my dad did (my dad worked on classified planes when I was much younger).  He seemed like such a gentle guy to me.  A bunch of other men suddenly joined as and started asking him for autographs, which he declined.  It seemed to snap him out of his happy mood, and he kind of shut down and walked away.  At that time I thought he was a bit of a jerk for not saying goodbye or anything, but I recently read about the hard time he had with fame, and I guess it makes sense."
22341,"Sounds like he’s really nice, but overwhelmed with the accidental stardom. I don’t blame him. I’d be the same way after years of that."
22342,"Genuinely amazing that you got to meet him, and 1 to 1 (with your dad) at that. He'll always be a one of a kind for what he achieved so you should feel very lucky to have met him :)"
22343,"Thanks. My dad was thinking the whole time “I should ask for an autograph” but he realized after the crowd showed up that the best you would’ve gotten from him was a conversation, and my dad got that. Nothing to put on your mantle, but a special moment still."
22344,"Armstrong was an engineer and preferred to just stay out of the limelight, I'm sure he enjoyed the chance to just talk engineering stuff with someone."
22345,"From a lot of interviews, Armstrong stated that if he knew what being “the first man on the moon” meant, he wouldn’t have done it. Buzz Aldrin’s got a bit of an ego and *absolutely* would have done it.

Which is why NASA made sure Neil went first."
22346,"I’ve read this as well.

Buzz was a bit of an egomaniac, not who they wanted with that distinction. But brilliant, quick thinker and always cool under pressure.

Armstrong wasn’t their first choice (he became the choice after the Apollo I fire), but he was the better person for the task.

Likewise Collins wasn’t a random pick either. He was also considered ideal for that role and this mission. Totally underrated part of the team. He’s a brilliant speaker/writer."
22347,"That's my understanding too, he had the proper personality to get the job done without letting it all go to his head."
22348,"My mom and sister met the Rock when he was still a wrestler. They had a couple car seats and tons of bags having a hell of a time getting off the plane and people were waiting and then this massive guy offered to carry some things for them and they happily took the help, he grabbed some bags and held the baby carrier with my niece in it and helped them off the plane and left. After people kept going up to them asking how they knew the rock and they were very confused until someone explained who he was."
22349,"Everything I ever hear about him he’s super cool.  He [did a rap](https://reddit.app.link/6bYQSntiy5)  from Moana with some dude interviewing him for the guys kids because the guys kids were massive Moana fans.

I reckon he’s so nice that on the aeroplane, I bet you he let the person next to him have the armrest.  He probably thought this isn’t the Rock’s elbow room, this is the people’s elbow room."
22350,"A few years ago Helen Mirren came to my job. I worked as a weekend hostess at a Ukrainian diner in NYC's the East Village, and very famous for its pierogis. I didn't know who Helen Mirren was at the time, and as it was a busy Saturday brunch, I asked for her name, put it on the wait list and let her know it would be 20 minutes. She just stood off to the side and talked with her two other companions. Never bothered me. Never demanded to be seated sooner. Never brought up her celebrity status. Customers kept coming up and asked if that was THE Helen Mirren. My boss eventually made me seat her before everyone else. Helen looked at her watch and remarked it hadn't been 20 minutes! All in all, Hellen Mirren 10/10 lovely person."
22352,Got the chance to meet him a few years back and he really is a pretty nice guy. Just has a low tolerance for bullshit
22353,"I was working on a set once where John C. Reilly acted as one of the main characters. It was a pretty small set and low budget (not even sure if the show ever aired) so we all found ourselves working closely together for the most part.

I sat across from him during lunch one day and we chatted for a bit about random stuff. The guy talks the same way he acts, which is why I think he plays such a great character in any comedy because he quite literally plays his own attitude in many roles.. at least it seems. 

But anyway he was a very nice and down to earth guy, I found it hard not to giggle every time he spoke because I just couldn't shake the image in my head of all the roles he's played."
22354,"Met Colin Mochrie at some obscure convention in my city. He actually talked to us for a few minutes and I basically just fan-girled about Whose Line and Royal Canadian Airfarce. Really great guy, he has my absolute respect."
22355,"I met John Candy on a plane when I was a little kid while traveling with my family.  He was a *big* man. He had the whole row to himself in front of us with the armrest up between seats so he could be more comfortable.   The stewardesses were blocking anyone from coming up and bothering him, even though they themselves were not exactly leaving him alone what with  talking to him constantly and laughing at his enjoyable banter the whole trip.

At some point he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he looked at me, pretended to do a double-take like he was surprised and said , ""hey, you're the quietest kid ever, don't you talk?""  The way he said it was so friendly that I just smiled and giggled. Then he had a pleasant conversation with my parents, who had been DYING to talk to him the entire flight, but were too polite to bother him.

Not even 2 weeks later we heard he had passed."
22356,Did he take his shoes and socks off? “Dogs are barkin’”.
22357,"Ha! Actually I remember he had a very inexpensive, almost cheap looking, cardigan sweater on.  Had it been anyone other than John Candy, I don't think anyone would have paid this man any mind at all."
22358,"> ""hey, you're the quietest kid ever, don't you talk?""

I literally heard him say that in my head as I read it."
22359,Those eyes.
22360,"I ran into Adam Sandler outside of a Planet Fitness in Brooklyn in early 2016. 

As I was leaving the Planet Fitness, it looked like he was walking in. We made eye contact, so I stopped and held the door for him. He got to the door and stopped right before he walked through, in one of those fake poses that little kids make when you tell them to freeze. I stood there holding the door, plenty confused. For about five seconds, we just stood there- him, motionless and I, standing there holding the door. Finally, he turned his head and said in the stereotypical Adam Sandler voice, ""Ahhh, who we kidding? I'm not going in there!"" Giant grin on his face. We both laughed and then he continued down the street. 

Awesome."
22361,He was in my town in NY shooting something for Netflix a few years ago. When he was done for the day he went down to the local park and started playing pickup games of basketball with people.
22362,"I went to Grad school at Pepperdine in Malibu, down the road from where he lives. Adam used to come a play pick up ball on campus pretty often. Nice guy for sure."
22363,I met him down in Nantucket one summer a few years ago. I had no money and so he bought me and my friends a pizza and shared it with us. Probably the greatest moment of my life.
22364,Where’s the picture? You HAD to take a picture.
22365,"He shook my hand before I went to pee. Then when I reentered the comedy club he asked me how it went. 

It was glorious."
22366,"Sandler is great. Whenever he comes into my job, he’s always a class act. He jokes around with the staff and is always super polite and grateful for the service.

You wouldn’t believe how much your fandom of someone is affected by how they are in real life. Before Sandler was a regular at my job, I liked some of his movies but since he’s come in a bunch I think he’s great and I found myself watching more Sandler stuff."
22367,"Same here.  He was a regular at my job in Santa Monica. Kevin James brought him in for his birthday.  Gave Adam my card/number but he never calls before he comes in,  doesn’t expect anything special."
22368,"I saw him do standup in the mid-90s and afterward noticed him waiting for his ride. So my friend and I went to say hello. He was really funny and self-deprecating, and kept ignoring the woman trying to get him to stop talking with us and get in the car. Pretty cool."
22369,"Yeah. I used to work in a movie theater in Santa Monica, Ca and we had celebrities come in on a practically daily basis. The one celeb who stood out for me, in terms of niceness, was Adam Sandler. He was always friendly to the staff when he came in and never failed to give a generous tip to the concession workers."
22370,"I met A few celebs working as an event photographer for fundraisers from time to time.

Chevy Chase, well, the stories are true. He was a huge jerk.

Jamie Lee Curtis was one of the sweetest people I've ever met, bar none and easily the nicest celeb I met working the camera. Very considerate and thoughtful person. She kept checking with us to see if she could do anything for us or if we needed any more shots she could help with. Great sense of humor too."
22371,Jamie Lee Curtis seems to do a good job remembering her extras. They did a bit on James Corden's show and she picked out the lady that did a scene with her several years ago.
22372,"My mom spotted Robin Williams once and she went up to him and asked if she could get a quick photo. She didn't realize he was there in the middle or about to do something with the Make A Wish Foundation so she waited until they were done around 20-30 min later and then a bunch of the kids and people wanted photos with him - he made it a point to stick around and told his staff ""I think that woman wanted a photo"" and made sure she got it. Mom was thrilled. He was such a humble nice dude."
22373,I was working in a little boutique store in Seattle with my girlfriend and it was a particularly slow day when all of a sudden Robin Williams walks through the door. He was the only one in the store and my girlfriend didn’t know who he was. We left him alone and when he came up to purchase his things he started barking at my Boston terrier in a cute way. It scared the crap out of my Boston terrier and he started barking back at Robin. He was so genuine and nice and I really do remember how hairy his arms were. For some reason that really stuck out. He walked out the door and instantly was surrounded by a bunch of tourists trying to take pictures of him. He put his bags in the back of his mini Cooper and drove off. He bought a little piece of artwork and three Goorin Bros hats.
22374,Seems like a lovely man. He is missed!
22375,"from what I can tell, the guy was as pure as the driven snow. really a tragedy"
22376,The fact that he remembered her after doing the event and then singled her out when others were mobbing him speaks volumes. Must be hard keeping track of so many things going on like that
22377,"Jamie Lee Curtis 

I worked with special needs young adults and was with a client at Gamestop. A woman walked in with a teenager and they were shopping around. We were the only customers there and when she asked for help from an associate I loved the way she spoke. 

I went to ask her where she was from and stopped before blurting out ""Wow. Has anyone told you that you look exactly like Jamie Lee Curtis?"" to which she smiled and replied ""That's because I am her."" 

I apologized and let her get back to her shopping. Afterward as she was about to leave I asked her if it would be alright if I called my wife and told her where it was I ran into her (I didn't know if she wanted her location blasted) and she said ""Of course. Want to take a picture?""

Absolute solid human. Love her."
22378,"I had a chance to work with Witney Houston for eight days on a film set. I was working as an extra. She was nice, kind and personable. Her beauty was more striking in person. 

She was very professional she did not miss a mark or a cue. Everybody on the set cried when she sang. Whitney Houston was very nice to me and complimentary she spoke sweetly and in a motherly tone when she greeted people. I can still rememer her friendly greetings when she arrived on set every day.

That was one of best experiences of my life and best experiences working on a film set. I learned a lot from her about professionalisim on a film set. I also saw how hard she worked. She was there twelve hours a day and on point every minute. I watched how she interacted with the director other actors and crew. She was even encouraging to other actors and performers in the film even the extras.

It was heartbreaking when she passed. I still have the dress that I wore in that film she admired and complimented me about the dress. An actor/ musician I know was booked to perform at the event Whitney Houston was to be at the day she passed he was also staying at the same hotel. He called me and told me she was gone then he started to cry."
22379,"For a couple years I went to a private school in Connecticut. My last year there, Bill Murray's sons transferred in. Neither was in my grade, but one of them was in the play with me. I was super nervous, but I was an SNL fan my whole life and had the 20th anniversary book that talked about all the cast members and behind the scenes stuff. After the show I (really shyly) said hi and told him I was a fan and asked him to sign it. He said ""whoa! I haven't even seen this yet! Cool!"" and then told the biggest lie ever told and said I was good in the show (I was awful, I forgot all my lines). 

Weirdly, this wasn't the first time I saw him. When I was about 6 we were at a restaurant in new jersey and he and his wife were at another table. Ghostbusters had just come out and I wanted to say hi but my parents stopped me.

Nice dude.

Edit: I've also met Big Freedia a couple times. Always super cool."
22380,"When my dad was about 9 (1964ish) he was on a plane from LA to Heathrow in coach with his mom. The stewardess came back and excitedly asked him if he wanted to ‘meet a beatle??’

My dad said sure but didn’t really know the Beatles at that age, and only said yes because that’s kinda what you do at that age. He sat on the couch next to George (different time, airlines treated you like people), George folds up his newspaper and says, “soo, do ya like my music?”

My dad says (like a confused 10 year old) “um, no”. Apparently George smiled and went back to reading his newspaper. My dad sat there like a doofus for like 5-10 minutes until the stewardess came and got him.

So George Harrison was cool to children, and my dad’s the most Stone cold 10 year old ever"
22381,"I work in Hollywood. So I've encountered a lot of celebrities.

22382,"Years ago working hotel security in Edmonton I was escorting Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers at 0400 in the elevator down from their rooms to the lobby to get in their Airport Limo. I am 6’5”, and so I towered over her. Dolly looked me up and down and said in her cute southern drawl “they sure grow ‘em big up here in Canada!” She was just as sweet as you could imagine.

Kenny, on the other hand, and I feel bad for saying this, due to his recent passing, treated me like the help (which I of course was) and even made a huffy impatient noise when, slightly flustered by Dolly’s remark, I struggled to find the key to put the elevator into independent service. Dolly touched my arm, looked me in the eye, and said “Darlin’, don’t you pay him any attention, we appreciate y’all!”

I guess I got the good and the bad in one shot."
22383,"Jesus, Dolly has got to be one of the most wholesome people to ever walk the earth!"
22384,"She is definitely one of the best. After the horrible fires in Gatlinburg , she personally saw that every family got financial assistance. Terrific lady and a great talent as well."
22386,"Nice couple of people to have met, particularly Buzz Aldrin. Always going to be a special person in history so you're a lucky person!"
22387,"met Jake Gyllenhaal at stage door after his play off-broadway last february. i was super nervous bc he’s my favorite actor and had heard stories of him not being nice. we said hi and as he was signing my playbill a lady shoved in front of me and demanded he sign her playbills for her daughters and that she “just has to get a photo!” he looked so uncomfortable and kept looking back at me, but he signed them anyway. im only 5’3 and was 17 so i just let it happen because i hate confrontation and was a lil starstruck by Jake. 
Well he told her off and said “you’re going to have to wait because i’m going to spend some time talking to her *points to me* because you cut her off.” he then turned so he was fully looking at me and HE apologized to me for her behavior. i just about died. we had a short conversation about his work, i thanked him profusely, and we took a photo. i have so much respect for him for handling the situation so well and all of my nervousness completely evaporated"
22389,"I met Paul Rudd on a flight from NY, sat next too him on the plane. My buddy leaned over and told me that he wanted to compliment him on this band shirt he wore when making Clueless, but he ""didn't want it to be weird"". So his solution was to write him a note and slip it to him, lol. So he does this, and Paul just gets this nervous look on his face, opens the note and reads it. Starts cracking up laughing, leaned over to us and said ""best note ever"". He then told us the whole story of the shirt, how he fought with the costume dept about it because it was the shirt he wore to set that day. We talked the whole flight, dude was super cool.

Edit: Band is Trip Shakespeare."
22390,"Oh, this makes me so happy! I saw his name and almost didn’t read on because I’d be so upset if he wasn’t nice."
22391,There's no way Paul Rudd isn't nice. He has the same anti-aging gene Keanu Reaves has. It must also cause niceness.
22392,"So I have a fun Paul Rudd story.

I worked at CVS at the time, and my manager had just eliminated smoke breaks- so I'm on edge and going nuts.  Paul Rudd walks in, and sees me.

For reference- I am generally disheveled in appearance.  I had a wizard beard braided down almost to my nuts, and I had worked overnight unloading the truck before popping on register.

He looks at me and just goes- ""rough night?""  I laughed, nodded.  I slurped at my coffee, which was more or less empty at this point.  My boss comes out of the office to yell at me about something, and Paul drops what he's doing, runs to my counter, and rings the little bell to interrupt the boss.  I run over and he has a single butterfinger on the counter.

I ring him out, and he laughs.  He says- ""how long you been here?""  Truthfully, I told him- 10 hours.  I sputter something about loving him in ""Fundamentals of Caring.""  He looks at my boss and says the best thing ever.

""I need [my name] to help me to my car with my purchase.  My back hurts.  Mind taking over for him?""

So i go outside, he bums a cigarette off me, and bought me coffee- then wouldn't let me inside until i finished a whole cigarette and half my coffee.  Boss came out to bitch, he laughs and says ""I still need his help loading my car.""  Honestly, its actually probably the single best customer-moment I've ever had in my time in retail.

Dude's goddamn awesome."
22393,"Holy shit that's literally the best story I've ever heard about any celebrity. Just a moment of real humanity. Always been one of my favorite actors, and it's so nice to hear that I would be proud to call him a friend in real life. You too, of course, my dude! Thanks for sharing."
22394,Omg lucky! I would love to meet Paul Rudd! He just seems so friendly and easygoing!
22395,"He was really chill, very laid back and nice. His family was really nice too. People came up asking for autographs and he just smiled and said sure. This one girl had him sign a book she had and he just laughed and signed it for her, he wasn't the author."
22396,"After college, I was living the intern life in New York, so I had to hunt around for a job that would be fine with me working just evenings. The first call I got was Kmart, so for about a month, I worked at Kmart Penn Station. 

One night, this guy with his hat pulled down low and this really cheerful girl came into the electronics department where I worked. It was a wild, wild store with tons of sketchy characters, so right away I was wary of him. Anyhow, they looked at the game selection for a minute, then the girl asked me if they could get Madden 2013. I obliged, took it from the case and began cashing them out. It was over the $50 minimum where I had to ask for ID with a credit card purchase, so I asked the sketchy fella for his ID. He told me, in this hushed little voice that he didn’t have it with him. 

Mhm. So I called up security to get the okay to finish up the transaction. As I’m talking to them, he tilts the credit card towards me. My first thought is, “huh. I didn’t know JP Morgan made a credit card?!” And then I looked at the name. 

Daniel Radcliffe. His girlfriend was beaming at me as the expected recognition washed over my dumb, tired face. He was super super gracious, and my height, which I loved even more (we’re both a firm 5’ 5”). 

And, I was pleased to be so calm and collected about the whole thing that they both got out of there without anyone else knowing who he was."
22397,"The Kmart in Penn Station is also sketchy but it was so big! I’m from a medium sized city in Texas so it was crazy to see all the stuff they had plus the Walgreens also located there...man, it was something else."
22398,"David Bowie was extremely nice - I worked on his production of Lazarus in NYC before he passed and was no older than 20 at the time - considerably younger than most on the crew. He took time out of talking to the director to turn to me and tell me that I was doing a phenomenal job on the production.

Meant the world to me that he would do that for the shy, unsure 20 year old, totally made my life."
22399,"Ewan McGregor accidentally ran over my bf's foot a couple of years ago when he was filming his Long Way Round series. He was absolutely lovely though, my bf loves bikes so he was over the moon bless him. Apparently they talked about his GS for a couple of minutes together, apparently it's one of his favourite memories. He had to restrain himself a little from roasting the GS as they are notorious for their unreliability"
22400,Tom Hiddleston told me my dog was awsome. So that was the highlight of my life lol.
22401,I am eternally jealous of this exact interaction
22402,"I saw Tom Hiddleston at LAX and I just froze like a deer in the headlights. He’s arguable the most regal human I’ve ever seen, he’s also way taller than I expected."
22403,"Met Linkin Park at Ozzfest '01 in Dallas, I was 11 walking by their booth with a long ass line, Chester and Mike seen a kid(me), told me to jump the railing, gave me a bunch of free shit they signed. Told me they were glad to see a new generation coming to concerts, and listening to rock.

Was one hell of an experience, too bad I was young, and didn't take care of the shit they gave me."
22404,I met the St. Bernard dog from Beethoven at Planet Hollywood when I was a kid.  Seemed like a pretty nice dog in person.
22405,"met Matthew Lillard, his wife, and newborn daughter like literally after the release of the 1st Scooby Doo Movie. My family always host 4th of July parties in our beach house, and he party crashed. I was like 7 or 8 at the time and my cousins were freaking out saying ""Shaggy is here!"". Of course I immediately sprinted over and he was eating a hot dog (super cliche I know since it's the 4th of July lol). He was so cool. The whole time he was in character and offering me to have him go get a hot dog for me. I remember my little cousins asking where Scooby was at and he replied, ""Oh Scoobs ate sooo many hot dogs that he's like, having a food coma"". Seriously, one of most highlighted memory dating back to my youth"
22406,That’s phenomenal. By all accounts he’s a good dude.
22407,"Met Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus Prime and Eeyore) at Botcon in 2012. They had a raffle system set up for autographs/meet and greets. He saw a bunch of us standing off to the side, including a man next to me who was sobbing because Peter meant so much to him. Peter full on RAN from the line he was supposed to be autographing and bear hugged this guy for at least a solid minute, patting his back and saying “It’s all right. Everything is okay. I’m here now,” while the guy sobbed on him. Then Peter autographed all our memorabilia and was whisked away by some very angry con staff.

Wonderful, wonderful man. Class act and genuinely kind."
22408,"> Met Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus Prime and Eeyore) at Botcon in 2012. 

A video that fans of him might enjoy :)

[Peter Cullen explains how he created the voice for Optimus Prime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zryfjSaxXLo)"
22409,My Grandma sat next to Rob Van Winkle (Vanilla Ice) on a plane before he was famous for ice ice baby. She knew who he was but didnt want him to know. They had a lovely 4 hour conversation and she said he was really intelligent and nice.
22410,I met the wiggles at a country pub in Australia and they are very cool blokes
22411,I met Kiefer Sutherland after one of his gigs and he was the most humble celeb I've ever met so genuine and nice he took pictures with everyone and signed everything there was about 15 people he even had a chat with is all and thanked us for waiting for him while he was doing a radio interview!
22412,"Used to do delivery runs for a catering company, and we would get a lot of celebrities at the airport that ordered from us. Johnny Depp was the only one I ever saw face to face. Dude pulled a wadded up bill from his pocket and tossed it at me. I thought it was cool I got a tip directly from him at all, but once I had it all unwadded it was $100 bill."
22413,"He's really a total sweetheart! I saw him at a few shows (he plays guitar with Alice Cooper) and after the set ended he leaned down from the stage to give me a hug. Smiling the whole time. I greeted him with ""Captain Jack!"" and he laughed, even though I was just a kid. Nicest dude!"
22414,I’m more impressed you were in the front row of an Alice Cooper show when you were a kid.
22415,"I noticed Ron Perlman while I was stocking veggies at Whole Foods. I met his eye and he asked me where the bell peppers were. I showed him and afterwards I asked, “are you an actor sir?” He paused and looked at me with a friendly smirk and said “Sometimes “. I smiled and nodded. I decided to roll with it and dropped the subject. He seemed to appreciate it and approached me again with another produce question a couple of weeks later. Seemed like a good dude with a pleasant vibe."
22416,"Snoop Dogg - Totally, unflappably chill, 100% of the time. It's like a super power.

Jon Bon Jovi - Smoked a cigarette with him, couldn't have been more down to earth. I believe he's making BBQ sandwiches for homeless people as we speak.

otoh:

Jeremy Piven - I like to give people the benefit of the doubt: Must've been method acting for the Ari Gold role."
22417,"Nearly 20 years ago, I literally bumped into Mick Foley at Six Flags in NJ, I was walking backwards down the exit ramp from a ride, while talking to some friends, and he was being escorted up the exit ramp with his kids, to skip the line.

My dumbass never saw em coming, and I backed right up into him, dude was super cool about, he just caught me, gave me a pat on the back when I apologized and said ""no problem dude, have a nice day."", and then I realized who it was as he was walking away.... my jaw dropped and one of my buddies just looked at me and said, ""Did Mankind just tell you to have a nice day?"""
22418,"I met miss Dolly Parton when I was just a wee kid in Illinois.  I've described it as being like meeting the sun.  She was just so happy and warm and wonderful, and she was the first person I'd met in real life with a southern accent."
22419,"Stephen Fry was absolutely delightful. Charming, chatty, got my name wrong once at the beginning of the evening and kept apologising for it over the course of the night. 

Katie Price was an absolute bollocking cunt. Seemed to believe she ranked just under The Queen in social standing. In actuality she ranks just under the drummer in the third best Queen cover band in Slough."
22420,">Seemed to believe she ranked just under The Queen in social standing. In actuality she ranks just under the drummer in the third best Queen cover band in Slough.

Haha fantastic

Stephen Fry is a genuine national treasure."
22421,"Ringo Starr likes this restaurant by my house. I have run into him a few times while I’m up there, if he’s with someone else then he’s bearable. 

There is thus one time though, I was with a friend and he exited he restaurant with his wife. My friend saw who he was and looked shocked. He just looked in our direction and said, “yes it is I” and drove off. 

We were then informed by the valet guy a few feet away that we got the lucky end because some older folks were nearby. In short Ringo is a salty man."
22422,">“yes it is I”

That's actually a pretty epic way to greet people"
22423,To be fair most of his life he's been hounded by mobs of people. It would make anyone salty after a few decades.
22424,Ringo has been one of the most famous people in the world for over 50 years. That has to be exhausting.
22425,"And he has been told that he doesn't deserve it.

I'd be pissed."
22426,"Terry Pratchett was as quirky and fun in real life as his books were.  His passing was a huge loss to me as we'd met several times in person and had multiple conversations online.  Felt like I'd lost a friend.

We met Robin Williams at Universal Studios when my wife's Grandmother was still alive.  She said hello to him and hoped his family was having a good time.  He tipped his hat to her and said ""Thank you kindly, Ma'am"".  She talked about that encounter the rest of her days.  In real life he was super short as well.

And, finally, Tim Hunkin who you've probably never heard of but he did a popular TV show in the 90s called The Secret Life of Machines.  I sent him an e-mail thanking him for helping me become interested in electronics and I got a very kind reply back."
22427,"Zach Efron is the nicest guy in the world! I met him at a New Years house party in LA. I asked him about his workout regime for ""neighbors"" and he. was so happy to talk to me. I honestly felt so comfortable talking to him i could have asked him to get me a drink at the bar and I think he would have done it. In the end i told him he was the nicest celebrity i have ever met. He looked at me and said ""hey man, real recognizes real""."
22428,"Worked on a Music video with both Pee Wee Herman, and Karen Gillan.

Pee Wee was super dickish and demanding and made the producers lives hell the whole time, and I only saw him when he was needed on set, had to be driven to and from his AC dressing room 30 minutes to film site. Complained the whole time. Had his own catering. Showed up late.

Karen was super chill. Ate with the crew, answered questions about Doctor Who and Marvel, did costume changes in a pass van, and was generally down to earth and charming. 

Also very tall. Wasn't expecting that. I have a hard time with super attractive women already,  and her towering over people really added to that."
22429,Wife and I met Penn and Teller after one of their shows. Teller was really nice and took my phone and took a selfie of the three of us. Penn was grumpy and seemed very annoyed he had to deal with these people.
22430,Danny Devito is one of the nicest people on earth.
22431,"I got hired to work a gig setting up a big LED wall for an afternoon for a musical act on a late night talk show.  We worked our asses off getting the LED wall ready, and had a while between the performance and tear down. We were told we could go to the green room to grab some water/sodas/whatever, but not to stay in there if there was anyone else and don’t bother any celebrities. We grab some sodas and walk out of the green room. One giant wall of the green room was all glass, so we went on the other side of the glass wall and hung out, hoping to catch a glimpse of any celebrities. 

Eventually Danny Devito walks into the green room, on the other side of the glass wall from us. Unbeknownst to any of us he was the celebrity guest that day. He waves at us from the other side of the wall, and then starts gesturing to all of us making the international hand gesture implying to smoke a joint. We’re all laughing and confused. He walks through the glass door into the same room with us and asks if any of us smoke pot. 

I was ready right then and there to get fired for smoking a joint with Danny Devito, but unfortunately no one had anything. We shot the shit with him for a little while and told him he was awesome, etc. 

Man I wish I could have gotten fired that day. He was an awesome guy to meet."
22432,"Was a server for Tom Cruise. Pretty cool dude, tbh. Was a bit out of touch, but that's to be expected. The funny part was he didn't know what he could order off of our menu, so he had to call his nutritionist to find out what to get. Ended up getting fried chicken"
22433,That's hilarious.
22434,"tbf, tom cruises nutritionist must hate tom when he goes for a midnight snack and calls him"
22435,"I'd bet that the fee he charges is embarrassingly large, and that he doesn't mind a bit."
22436,His nutritionist: https://media.giphy.com/media/94EQmVHkveNck/giphy.gif
22438,"James Corden. I was a porter at a hotel a very long time ago, he'd had a couple of very minor TV roles. I had no idea who he was but others did. He came down in the morning yelling at the receptionist that someone had taken vhs tapes from his room. He demanded to know who had access to his room, me being the only person on duty that night with a master key was pointed out and he proceeded to accuse me of sneaking into his room while he slept and stealing tapes. After ten minutes of verbal abuse and threats one of his ""people"" came in and told him they found his tapes in the car and he stormed out with so much as a goodbye. Throughly horrible human being."
22439,He was in Cats... So the universe got him back for ya.
22440,"The entire cast of What we do in the shadows tv show. 

I work in film as a carpenter, so I was invited to the wrap party. They were all really nice and everyone got absolutely plastered it was a really good night."
22441,I didn’t expect to like that show as much as I did and am eagerly anticipating season 2. Horny for love...
22442,"Ran into Steve Carell in an Orange County bathroom a couple years ago. I made a bad Office joke. He laughed. Nice guy.

Edit: Since people are asking:

“Steve Carrell. How the turntables have.... wait.”"
22443,"Ran into Gordon Ramsay with his daughter at the Tom's Coffee on Abbot Kinney in Venice Beach (yes, Tom's the shoe brand has a dope coffee shop). Didn't want to interrupt his day out with his daughter by asking him for a photo, so I just gave him a ""hey, chef"" to which he responded, ""hey how you going?"". Super nice dude when he's not expected to cuss people out and call them idiot sandwiches on tv!"
22444,"Met -- hung out with for an hour or so -- Kiefer Sutherland.

It was an amazing coincidence running into him as we had plans to go see him at his concert the coming Saturday night. (Tickets were free, but you had to stand in line to get 'em.)

My son was bartending -- I came in to see my son -- and he said, ""hey Dad, I got someone I want you to meet...""

So when I met him, the first thing out of my mouth was ""oh my goodness, we loved you in Lost Boys, in 24, in so much -- and believe it or not my wife and I are coming to see your band on Saturday!""

He LOST IT!!! He was like, ""most people don't have a clue about my music... I can't believe you guys are coming! That's so awesome...""

Yeah, he was thrilled....

So I called my wife? Then she swung by the bar too to meet Kiefer.

Long story short, he left really great seats for us at the will call.  Then during the concert he called out for my wife and me to stand up...then he dedicated a love song to us.

He's a good dude!!!"
22445,Omg... I love him I would die
22446,"I met Tony Hawk at a local skate park. Just randomly he showed up. Of course people were freaking out, but he was such a laid back guy. Shook my hand and made small talk with me, a real nice guy.

A couple years ago, I ran into Skrillex in a public rest stop in Maine. He was doing a show later that night in the area, but for obvious reasons, I thought the restroom was a bad place to try to say hello. By the time I got outside, he was already on his tour bus. I’ll always regret that lol"
22447,"Not me but my uncle used to be a professional body guard. He said by far, Tom Hanks was the kindest and the worst was Azelia Banks.


Here’s a video of her on Wild ‘N Out. Shows her true colors: https://youtu.be/ZVx8WS8ndgU"
22448,"Stan Lee, that guy was just as awesome in person. Rest in peace Stan"
22449,"I met him at a con shortly before he passed.  I was ecstatic, its stan fucking lee!  But he barely moved, he could have been a robot. Didnt talk during autographs, didn't move a muscle in photos. I was a little disappointed but can understand not having the energy at his age to be animated all day long.  He did have a ton of energy at his panel and was like a completely different person, like he was saving up his energy all day for that panel."
22450,"Stan Lee shouldn’t have been attending comic conventions in 2017-2018. After his wife passed away, he was never the same. His sense of energy and spirit were gone and his health was clearly in decline. 

I met him about a dozen times between 2012-2016 and he was a delight to speak with every time! He had that same fun and friendly “larger than life” personality in person that I saw on TV and in the movies."
22451,So I met Brock Lesnar in Milwaukee WI at I believe a smackdown show. I believe it was John Cena vs Brock Lesnar as the main event and Brock was put through the announcers table at the end. I came up with my sign that said MilBrockee and got to shake his hand I was pry like 10or11 at the time so his hand engulfed mine. Brock was a big heel at the time he patted me on the shoulder and thanked me for being a fan I was upset I didnt get an autograph I had the red and black markers still. 4-5 years later I was at a Vikings Bears Monday Night Football game. Brock was there again I was trying to get players autographs when Brock came up pointed to me and said “MilBrockee?” Absolutely made my already great night even better. And I got him to sign my vikings program this time. Blows my mind he could recognize me.
22452,"Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman from Mythbusters are amazingly nice to fans. My son, seven years old at the time, asked them questions that had me cringing and thinking, ""You had a chance to ask them something and you asked them this??"" But Adam and Jamie treated his questions as seriously as they would have treated a question from Barack Obama. They acted like we were the most important people in the world at that moment, and like they had no better place to be."
22453,"I worked as a waiter at a popular restaurant near San Francisco for a few years. It used to be a super popular spot back in the 60's/70's as it offered the celebrities of that time a place to dine just outside of the city without the crowds of fans. A lot of them would still visit on occassion during my employment there (2009-12). 

My favorite individual encounters are waiting on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, and serving apps to Robin Williams and his wife. They were all really nice given the setting. I didn't really exchange any conversation besides telling Robert Plant that I was a fan when dropping the check, and him thanking me. I can't remember exactly what they ordered to eat, but I know he had a virgin Bloody Mary to drink. 

Every time someone famous came in was exciting to me but my more tenured co workers were pretty used to the sightings. I remember noticing the height difference between Williams and his wife, as well as her looking very beautiful. Of course, seeing his legendary smile irl that I had grown up watching my entire life will be a permanent memory of mine.

Carlos Santana came in once and was seated in my section, but I gave the table to another server higher up on the food chain who had waited on Carlos more than once in the past. He was wearing white pants, a white jacket, and a nice looking fancy white hat. He had a bowl of Bouillabaisse (iirc) and was also one of the first customers to walk in that day. Most first comers during the summer snag tables on the patio that look out across the bay, but he wanted to sit inside next to a window. After his meal, he went through the kitchen and took a few group pictures with all of the cooks and bussers. Seemed really friendly.

Bonus bogus ""celebrity"" experience having to wait on a C list actor that was in the 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" film. He made SURE I knew that he was in an upcoming Disney remake featuring Johnny Depp. This was before I had seen any sort of advertising for the movie, and I still haven't actually watched it so I'm not sure if he even made the cut. He got wasted drunk and was an arrogant ass. Think he told me that he was the hot air balloon pilot? Or something? Guy sucked. First time I ever served St. Germain.

Also, I waited in line for Space Mountain at Disneyland with Sean Penn and his also famous wife at the time and their kids. I noticed it was him while he and his son were standing in a semi roped off area just outside of the actual line where the rest of their family stood. An employee eventually came over and reminded him that they couldn't wait there and they hopped back in line one or two parties ahead of me. When the line turned into a switch back style and he was facing me I flashed the measliest peace sign a pimply faced star struck teenager could, and he nodded in turn. The fact that he and his family were actually waiting in a 40 min line for a ride, and the way he responded when asked to get back in line, made him seem more human to me."
22454,"I had Nick Hogan, Hulk Hogan's son, for a client at my business about 10 years ago. The kid gets a bad rap. For being so young, he was very professional, understood the business we were doing, and was impeccably polite.

After working with Nick for about two years, he stopped by my office one day and the Hulkster walked in with him. I did a happy dance on the inside, but played it cool on the outside. Hulk just kind of hung around our lobby while Nick and I had a brief 10 minute meeting.

When I walked Nick out of my office, he introduced me to his dad, Hulk Hogan. I shook hands with Hulk and said it was nice to meet him. Like Nick, he was super nice.

Nick kind of looked at me, smiles, and says, ""You want a picture with my dad?"" Remembering which of them was my actual client, I said, ""Really, I'd like a picture with both of you if it's okay!""

And that's how I got a picture of me with Nick Hogan on my right and Hulk Hogan on my left."
22455,"Meet quite a few working at Disney.  Some of the notable ones for their personalities:  


Drew Carey: nicest freaking celebrity at Disney.  Dude doesn't even act like one.  Just goes around like parks like a regular tourist.  Waits in lines, no special treatment, etc.  So many people have waited in line with him and left thinking they were talking with that guy who looks so much like Drew Carey, not realizing it was him.  (Just to be safe he still has a hostess that goes around with him, let's us know he is coming, etc, but stays out of the way)

Bill Nye: kinda of a dick.  Spent the whole time just talking about all the things he was in at Disney.  

Christie Brinkley: super nice."
22456,"Dave Grohl came into the record store I used to work at on my day off, so I missed it (ughhh) but got the play-by-play. One of my coworkers didn't recognize him at first, but then did, which lead to the following conversation: 

Coworker: Hey man, is there anything I can help you fi- HOLY SHIT, you're Dave Ghrol!

Dave Grohl: haha yeah.

Coworker: Oh man, I totally did not play that cool. Umm... uh... Oh, is there anything I can help you find? 

Dave Grohl: I'm good, but thanks! 

They left him alone, but at the end when he was checking out, he offered to sign some stuff or take pictures, which everyone took him up on. Super chill, super nice guy apparently.

Edit: Grohl"
22458,"Tom Hanks, absolutely nice. I met him when I worked at in n out burger a few years back. I took an order to his table & was startled when I saw him & I asked “Are you Tom Hanks.” & he looks up from his meal, gives the biggest friendliest smile & says “you betcha.”

When I’m clocking out & leaving he’s heading out exactly as I am so I hold the door open for him, & he greets me with a Thank you. & as he & his son are walking away I say “Mr. Hanks if it’s not any trouble could I possibly take a picture with you?” He turns around with another big grin & says “walk with me kid.” So we talked for about 10 minutes, he asked me about my life, told him all of my favorite movies he is in. He gave me some life advice & his son (very nice but just quiet) took some pictures of us. He gave me a handshake followed by a hug saying it was nice to meet me. I said “I’m glad the most famous person I got to meet was you.” Then they left.

Needless to say my co-workers stared through the windows the entire time & then hounded me for a week about it."
22459,"I met Sebastian Stan on the streets of Paris while they were filming for the spy movie (305?). All around was super nice. He was just standing off set, and I kinda just walked up and said hi and he was super nice, and kept asking questions as to what I was doing in Paris etc and seemed genuinely involved in our conversation."
22460,"Sylvester McCoy came through my line at Target once. I recognized his voice and just kept telling myself it wasn’t him. I couldn’t shake the feeling so I asked

“I know this sounds stupid but you sound like The Seventh Doctor.”

He answered coyly “The truth is ( he puffs up his chest) I am him.”

I totally geeked out and Davros (Terry Malloy) was with him. I never got a photo but hot damn we’re they just amazing people."
22462,Woody Harrelson came to my college and ended up hanging out drinking and smoking with us. Nice guy!  The highlight was when he sang The Kelly Song (from Cheers -  yeah I'm old) to my friend Kelly.
22463,"I’ve run into Stephen King a few times in Bangor, Maine. He’s a chill dude, always willing to smile and chat a bit."
22464,"Teemu Selanne - I met him at the local hockey rink, got a photo, chatted for a bit, and he was great about it!"
22465,"My manager at gamestop back in 2005 told me about the time he was a kid and ran into Jake the Snake Roberts at some diner or something while on a family trip.

Jake was sitting at a booth eating by himself. My boss was a big fan of wrestling and wanted to go over and say hello. My boss asked Jake ""where's Damien?"" and the wrestler responded, ""Right here, kid."" as he adjusted his junk. 

Seemed pretty on-brand."
22466,"Adam Sandler - Super nice and cool

Tom Hanks - Class Act

Seal - Kind of a dick

Geena Davis - Total Sweetheart

Jamie Lee Curtis - All I’ll say is “surprisingly reasonable”. She had an objectively bad experience and was reasonably upset by it. 

Colin Farrell - Totally Cool

Matt Damon - Quiet but polite

Will Smith - Awesome and always “on” 

Jaden Smith - just like his dad

Jason Mamoa - Sweetheart

Ray Liotta - Definitely a character but super cool

Michael J Fox - Sweetheart

James Corden - dick

Britney Spears - I think we caught her in a rough time

Kardashians - exactly what you’d imagine

Finn Wolfhard - Kiiiiind of a dick but I’m sure it’s more of him just being young. 

Tobey McGuire - Quiet but cool"
22467,"> Britney Spears - I think we caught her in a rough time

Probably. Seems like 99% of her life is rough between the fame and father issues."
22468,Why am I not surprised everyone that’s ever met James cordon thinks he’s a dick.
22469,"I worked on a project with Michael Franti, who is the kindest, most patient, most humble and most friendly celebrity ever.  He truly treats the janitor job folks with as much respect and attention as the execs.

Lovely human being."
22470,"I met Jim Carrey when I was like 11 at a party my parents attended. I couldn't stop staring at him. He was behaving so normal and then when he noticed me staring he did a mask facial expression and started staring at me. 

He's a genuinely funny guy and probably has the purest of heart."
22471,"Nice - Vince Vaughn on a plane, he was super nice. Also very doting you his wife and kids. Super tall.

Rude - Kevin James, he was so condescending and rude to his assistant. Didn’t even acknowledge the fans that wanted to meet him."
22472,"Courteney Cox, she was the sweetest woman I've ever met"
22474,"My mom was unhappily taking her first golf lesson in St Louis. She spent 1 or 2 miserables hours at the driving range with an instructor.

Irritated and swearing to never take golf lessons again, she met dad in the Golf store clubhouse after the lesson. 

Before they left her instructor came by and said, “exciting day, huh!”

My mom, said it was ok. 

The instructor replied, “are you kidding, Michael Jordan was in the tee box next to you for an hour, chatting up a storm.”

My mom replied, “that was Michael Jordan?”

My dad just stood there with his jaw on the floor."
22475,"Nikki Sixx went to high school with my parents and was one of my moms best friends at that time.

I got to hang out in his dressing room when they had their first reunion tour. He's a really nice, humble dude. I wouldn't go as far as to say he's immature, but he was very boyish and teenager like. But I guess that's kind of what happens when you become a famous rock star at the age of 19. You never have to grow up."
22476,"Met Superman, Christopher Reeve, (before his accident) at a small town charity function. No entourage, no fancy demands, just a genuine nice guy being the auctioneer at a tiny event In Texas. A swell fellow."
22477,"Jeff Goldblum is one of the nicest men in the world and was my best friend for 20 minutes.

When I was 14, I was in the children's chorus of a professional opera company and his at the time gf (now wife!) was in a production as a featured Cirque du Soleil acrobat. He was backstage before one of the shows, but no one was approaching him (idk if they were shy or just trying see seem cool and chill while a celebrity was around). Awkward ass 14 year old me finally gathers up some courage and goes up to him and says ""Excuse me, Mr. Goldblum? I just really wanted to say I loved you in The Big Chill"" (which I'm sure is not the film he expected to come out of a 14 y/o's mouth). He took a picture with me and then we just talked for a solid 20 minutes. He asked me all about being a kid working at an opera theater and what I wanted to do when I grew up. And he was so engaged and you could tell genuinely cared and was interested in what this awkward looking little 14 y/o has to say. So that's the story of when I hung out with my 20-minute bff Jeff Goldblum backstage."
22478,"Nice:  

Ed Sheeran. In 2013, my husband was working at a stadium and got free tickets for my 13-year-old niece to see Taylor Swift, but she was mostly excited for Ed. He was relatively unknown at the time and was the opener. This was the 2nd night of the show, so my husband knew that if we were back stage at his office at a certain time (after he sang a song with Taylor), he would pass by. So, we went back and waited and, sure enough, he came upon us with his band. We were the only people around and my niece was *barely* holding it together, she loved him so much . He talked to us for several minutes, signed everything she asked, took photos (photo of them together https://imgur.com/a/grDH5hH) and have her his guitar pick. Could not have been nicer. She lost it and started bawling her eyes out as soon as he left. It was incredible. I felt like the coolest aunt in the world. 

Gwyneth Paltrow, back in 2003 or 4, just before she announced she was pregnant the first time. She was staying in the hotel that I worked in as a shoe shine girl. We just made small talk, but she was very sweet and I felt like an equal with her.


I worked as a hostess in LA and these stood out as bad:

Martha Plimpton was very condescending 

I got a ""do you know who I am"" from Jeffrey Tambour when I didn't recognize him right away

Steve Madden said, ""do you know who I am? I'm Steve Madden. I have a store right down there on the promenade"" when he came in with 12 people and I didn't immediately have a table for him."
22479,Back in 2004 my mom took me on a trip to LA to do some shopping for my 13th birthday. We went to Rodeo Drive just to look around at all the fancy stores and when we popped into Louis Vuitton I saw Nicky Hilton along with her body guard. Now being a teenage girl in the early 2000’s I absolutely loved the Hilton sisters and Nicole Richie. I went up to her and asked if I could get a picture with her and she said yes! My mom got out the camera to take a picture when the sales staff came running over telling us we couldn’t take pictures inside the store. I was pretty bummed. Nicky then asked me if I’d like to go outside and take a picture with her. I was so excited she dropped everything just to go outside and take a picture with me! We take the picture and talk with her for a few minutes before going our separate ways. She was so kind and very soft spoken. Nothing like you’d read about her and Paris in the tabloids. It made my birthday for sure!
22480,"When I was 5 years old I was running down a hotel lobby in Miami until I crashed into JayZ’s legs.

From my fathers perspective he said JayZ laughed it off and continued his walk down the lobby."
22481,"Bill Nye. Horrible. I took a group of high school students to an engineering fair at University of Illinois in 2001. Bill was a special guest. This was a big deal for one of my students as he was the inspiration to pursue science. My student made a t-shirt that she wanted to get signed by him if she got the chance. We drove four hours to get there, walked around and viewed the projects that were on display, and watched some battle bot competitions. On our last walk through, here comes Bill down the hallway. I nudged my student to go ask for an autograph. She told him that he was a huge inspiration and asked if he would sign her shirt. He said that he did not appreciate that she was interrupting his walk. She showed him the shirt. He rolled his eyes, scribbled on the shirt, and tossed it to her. She looked like she was going to cry. Instead she walked over to a garbage can and threw it away. He said, ""Whatever"" and went back to looking at the projects."
22482,I believe it. My biology teacher in high school met him and he kept reminding the class how much of a douche he was lmao
22483,I’ve met his nephew. Even he said the guy’s a dick.
22484,Everyone someone posts this questions I hear another story about what a dick he is.
22485,He spoke at my undergrad my friend was one of the students who encountered him as she was on the event staff. Similar comments from her.
22486,"I met Lady Gaga on a street corner in lower Manhattan two years ago. I had no idea it was her so we struck up a conversation as two random strangers and she ended up having her friend take a picture of us. I only found out who she was when I was getting into my uber and her friend yelled out, ""Hey you know that was Lady Gaga right!"" She was really friendly and down to Earth"
22487,"Jimmy Carr was awesome, kind patient and funny, even though were probably being quite annoying. He even signed my Sylvia Plath book."
22488,"I sat next to David Bowie and his wife while we were all waiting for a flight at the Montego Bay airport in Jamaica when I was like 19 . He bought me a Ting (jamaican drink)  from the drink cart and we all chatted for a bit. They were both just like ""regular"" people even tho they were both mega stars. We laughed about how hot it was in that damn airport and we parted ways when they boarded. As I walked through the plane, I had to walk past their first class seats.....he winked, smiled, and said ,""it was a joy meeting you (my name).""
Ziggy fucking Stardust said my name ! I will never forget that hour. Hit me hard when he passed away. RIP Ziggy. Have fun on Mars!"
22489,"Gordon Ramsey is one of the nicest people I’ve ever met, fuck Toby Maguire"
22490,I wonder if celebrities are reading this trying to find their name in the comments
22491,"Drew Barrymore is great. In 2009, I was in college and flying home from MIA to JFK for Thanksgiving. I saw her at the top of the escalator to my gate being swarmed by people asking for photos. For whatever reason, my dopey closeted 19-yr-old self decided that yelling “Drew! I love you so much!” was the appropriate thing to do. I swear to you, she locked eyes with me and used it as an excuse to get away from the crowd. We rode the escalator down together and she said something along the lines of “you’re so sweet, thanks for getting me out of that!” and we talked about our Thanksgiving plans. She ended up being on my flight back to NY. All in all our interaction lasted 30 seconds, but she was so kind and down to earth, I’ll never forget it. I work in the film industry now, and hope our paths cross one day so I can tell her how she completely made my day back then, aha."
22493,"The stories she tells about Jason Momoa are pretty hilarious as well. Apparently, they’re really good friends."
22494,"I love how OP asked for celebrities who are either assholes or nice... and most stories are about awesome celebs. 

I’m genuinely surprised."
22495,"When I was in high school, Michael Keaton offered me a ride on the rural Montana road my dad lived on. I'm talking, town of 300 people. It had started raining and he pulled over in his nondescript Jeep. I was almost at my dad's house, I said no thanks (also, total stranger). It wasn't after he drove off that I realized who he was. This was at the height of his Batman fame. 

I told my dad when I got back to his house. His response: ""Sure! Was he driving the batmobile?"" Totally didn't believe me. A few hours later, he gets a call that MK was in town that day looking at property."
22496,"I chatted with Heath Ledger in a cafe/comic store place once. It was a kind of underground nook, really quiet, around 2006 I think because I remember Brokeback Mountain had come out and it was huge so I recognised him from that among other things. I’d got my coffee and book and went round to find a seat and I saw a handsome looking guy in the corner, which was weird. This place wasn’t really known for attracting good looking people. I sat in my booth but kept glancing at him every few minutes, is it him? Nah can’t be. No it is him that’s definitely him holy shit, type of glancing. I finished my drink then grabbed one more look at him, he caught me and waved at me. I went over and asked if it was him and he said yeah, he was reading Swamp Thing by Allan Moore so I said that was a good read, complimented his work on Brothers Grimm. He said thanks and asked if I wanted a seat. So I sat with him and chatted about shit from comics, movies to just life for like maybe an hour. I was 20 at the time and talked about a girl I was seeing, one of my first girlfriends and he gave me some advice and seemed genuinely interested. Super nice dude, seemed pretty unpretentious and happy to just relax without being fake for paparazzi."
22497,"My mom was hiking in the mountains in Georgia and saw a couple people wearing headsets walking around with some local law enforcement. She thought she'd stumbled upon some crime scene, but it turned out they were a film crew being looked over by the sheriff's department while ""A Walk in the Woods"" was being filmed. She got to meet Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. Both of them were apparently very nice."
22498,"Not a story of mine, so can’t really confirm but nevertheless made me laugh my ass off.

So a friend of mine had the chance to meet Patrick Roach (Guy who plays Randy in Trailer Park Boys) in a party. Being a huge fan of the show, my friend walks up to him and tells him how he’s been a fan of the show since childhood and how he respects his acting. Apparently the guy just looked at him, said “Oh that’s cool man! Watch this!” And proceeded to pound fat line of coke through his nose right in front of him..."
22499,"Davy Boy Smith - wrestler back in the day - I was at a wave pool in Edmonton. I was around 12 years old, deep end of the pool for the waves. He stole my tube I was floating on and when I grabbed onto it so I didn’t just about drown, he told me to fuck off and shoved me off it."
22500,"Drake Bell came to my college last year and sang/played guitar. He was big when most of us were grade schoolers, but he does next to nothing now. His musical skills weren’t bad, but he did a terrible “show” because he said nothing between songs. Despite the fact that he’s now touring small, rural colleges, he was a royal jerk to all of us."
22501,He came to my school too! He came out twice for some reason and was so pissed about it. He sang the drake and josh song like 3 times. It was weird
22502,Oh Josh Peck came to my college and it was exactly opposite; he just talked to us for an hour about his acting career and Drake and Josh
22503,"Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki, the voices of Bob and Larry from Veggietales, were nice."
22504,"Ugh, those guys must be so sick of getting recognized everywhere they go"
22505,It's hard to be incognito when you're a giant sentient vegetable.
22506,"Once met Colin Hanks at SXSW! My wife noticed him first, but didn’t think it was actually him. We were arguing about it and he came over.  He was super nice, even suggested a band that we should go see. Saw him at said show and he waved at us."
22507,"My mom met Bob Marley outside of a concert out of pure luck. Her friends had already left without her and he got a security guard to drive her home. 

Years later her best friend gave my mom a signed poster that said he hoped she was doing good and had better friends.

Edit: Holy shit that’s a lot of likes. Thanks"
22508,"I worked at the premier hotel in my town so I've met quite a few:

Bill Cosby- was nice and made conversation

Prince: pissed off because we said he couldn't smoke in the room. He then tried to bribe us.

Patrick Warburton: nice but really tired looking. 

Ringo: still wants to be popular and will do his best to remind you of it.

Mayweather: was really nice, TV seems to make him more mouth than what he is. He does have like 30 people that ride with him though.

Seal: Quiet doesn't say much and just wanted to go to sleep.

Donald Trump: very business and his body guards dont play. Had to send two employees home at the order of secret service.

Usher: Went to his room and saw to girls sleeping at the door. He turned around and told us he would ne sleeping in his bus.

Larry Holmes: a has been that wants free rooms and can't accept that the world has left him.

Malcome of malcome in the middle: really nice and didn't look like he had aged any.

Kesha: I delivered the message table and she answered in a towel. She was really sweet but doesn't tip.

Wayne Gretzky: a insufferable asshole that his wife had to keep apologizing for his bad attitude.

Richard Karn of home Improvement: Really nice and way down to earth.

Larry the cable guy: He actually told his security to back down so he could see his fans.

Wwe: these guys are very well behaved and very professional.

Dana Carvey: was very chill checking in and even did a Garth impression from Wayne's World without us asking.

Minor soap stars can be the worst: several females with minor roles will constantly say ""I'm an actress"" when ever asking for specific stuff.

Jesse Jackson: Always has to be in the presidential, request massage therapist at odd hours and remains very professional at checking in.

Ben Stein: Does not talk really slow and is actually a great tipper. very polite and he bought my girlfriend waffles because she had to work late at the hotel.

I'll add or answer questions as I go."
22510,It makes me so happy that she called you a boob.
22511,"I feel like I just answered this recently, lol.

Adam Lambert is a absolute gem, and I say this without bias. He's extremely kind, remembers me when I see him, and makes an effort to honestly connect with you. Even told me that it was nice to see ME again when I last saw him, haha. I've had some definite moments of feeling special while being around him, and that's a great feeling when you admire someone. <3"
22512,I waited on him in NYC once. I charged his phone for him. He didn’t know about the airplane mode trick for iPhones. I did it for him and he was very grateful. His friends picked up the check (around $240). They left $20. He came back and gave me $60.
22513,"My dad tells us the story of a coffee date he went on in college, and the girl he was with noticed Tim Curry was there ordering a coffee. She keeps trying to make eye contact but eventually realised that Tim was checking out my dad! 

I'll be honest my dad's not a very serious man, but he swears this one is true. Either way take it with a grain of salt"
22514,"I met Chelsea Handler when I lived in telluride, and to be honest, I'm not even sure I can call it meeting her, because she was so rude about the incident. I was taking the gondola home after having a few drinks with my friends, headphones in, minding my own business. The gondola stops half way at a restaurant and she and a friend were waiting to get on. She spots me, and very loudly announces to her friend that she isn't going to ride with someone they didn't know. Her friend rolls his eyes and tells her that I probably don't care who she is and to just get on the gondola. Keep in mind, I hadn't even taken a second glance, I didn't care. She reluctantly gets on, but the entire time she kept glaring at me and huffing under her breath. She gave off huge ""I'm more important than you"" vibes.

Also while I worked up there I had to tell Coolio he couldn't smoke a joint on the porch of the place I worked at. He was cool about it."
22515,"I met Jimmy Carter. He was great. He was giving out autographs/photos. His security told us we couldn't get an autograph unless we had one of his books, he told them to back off and let us in anyway."
22516,I met Chris Hemsworth at a convention in Australia. Our only interaction was him apologising to me for a mother’s rudeness as she shoved me out of the way because her child meeting Chris was more important
22517,"Super nice: R. Lee Ermey, Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, the Irish Tenors

Polite but not interested in engaging with a stranger: Keith Urban 

Kind of a dick: Kenny Chesney"
22518,Ran into Stone Cold Steve Austin outside the Toronto Skydome after WrestleMania 18. I told him he had a good match that night and he shook my hand and said “nice to meet you sir”. Seriously the only person I’ve ever been ok with calling me “sir”. I was like a 21 year old nobody at the time.

22524,That rampart AMA was pretty special.
22525,"I personally liked Keanu Reeves' [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2j4ce1/keanu_reeves_hello/), especially with all the ""uhmms"" and how he replies to his own comments."
22526,r/keanubeingawesome
22527,The steven siegel AMA is pretty funny.
22528,Val Kilmer.  He seems like a dude you would like to have as a neighbor.
22529,Leah Remini went the fuck in on Scientology.  In both of her AMAs she was remarkably candid and incisive in her comments.
22530,Lil Dicky's AMA was hilarious
22531,"Jeff Bridges was great, some really deep and thoughtful answers"
22532,"When in St. Louis, his hometown, John Goodman used go to strip clubs on the east-side and tried to tip the dancers in coupons from a restaurant where he is part owner.


Edit:  I don't believe John Goodman is particularly a dick.  I have also met him in Vegas and he was a very nice guy.  His actions at the strip club were in my opinion a little funny...the girls working there had a different opinion."
22533,I can't help but laugh at the image of this.
22534,"""The guy from Roseanne just tried to tip me in fuckin' coupons!"""
22535,"Quick story. Michael Crichton wrote about being in awe of Sean Connery, but one evening at dinner a fan approached Connery and asked for an autograph. He snapped ""I'm eating."" The fan  walked away dejected and Crichton was kinda disappointed in Connery.  But after dinner Connery walked back to the fan and said ""I'm finished my meal if you'd like that autograph now.""  Bottom line: celebs have boundaries that we can't always see, but they're entitled to have them.  Of course, some are just dicks."
22536,I'd probably be a little upset if someone walked up to me while I was enjoying a meal and asked me to sign something.
22537,"This happens to me, like, every day.

Maybe I should stop eating at my desk..."
22538,"It is pretty crass to interrupt someone's meal to ask them for something - particularly a stranger in a public place. Connery's a man of principle, and he made good when it was appropriate. I hope the fan learned something from it."
22539,"My mother is a flight attendant and had Lucille Ball on a flight. When my mom came by with the beverage cart and asked Lucy what she would like,  she turned her head and looked out of the window, which was followed by her assistant saying, ""I'm sorry, Ms. Ball doesn't speak to the help""."
22541,That takes a special kind of bitch. I hate celebrities that think they're magically above the rest of the population.
22542,"Strangely enough, her assistant who spoke to your mom may be a dear friend of mine. He has told me stories, and trust me, your mom isn't the only one she treated like shit."
22543,"Actually, she said that very thing, that Lucille Ball was notorious amongst flight attendants at the time (""stewardesses"" at the time) for being a snob."
22545,"Charles Barkley is the man! When I was like 8 years old I saw him at a restaurant, all these kids crowded around him while he was waiting to order. My mom said it would be ok to go say hi while all the other kids were getting autographs but I was too scared and thought the other kids were being rude. Finally after he was finished with dinner my mom went over and asked if it would be okay for me to come say hello. Then I saw him smile and wave me over. He was so incredibly nice. He thanked me for being polite and waiting until he finished his dinner to say hi, asked me my name, and then I started crying because I was so nervous and overwhelmed (he was my hero at the time) He just gave me a bunch of hugs and talked to me for a little bit. I didn't have anything for him to sign so he autographed his table cloth(it was paper) ripped it off and gave it to me. I know I met him when I was a little kid but he seemed absolutely huge!"
22546,"Met Michael Jordan while off work when I worked at Disney and just casually said ""Hey Michael."" Got a ""Go Away"" as a response which pretty much turned me off of MJ forever. Some celebrities that were absolute delights though are Robin Williams, Johnny Knoxville (who I ran into at a military surplus store in NYC where he bought the sailor outfit you see him wearing in the Jackass movies, even signed my bag ""see you in the showers"") and Michael Clarke Duncan who rode The Haunted Mansion with me after I greeted him with his full name, such a nice dude with a hilarious laugh."
22547,"Robin Williams stopped by the comic/game store where a friend of mine used to work. Dude bought about $300 worth of Warhammer 40K models (he was trying to build out his Eldar army, he said), and stayed around to chat with the staff before he left for a show he was headlining in town. Took pictures with all the staff before he left. Sounds like a real decent dude."
22548,Wow. Robin Williams plays Eldar.
22549,That piece of hollywood trivia is carved into my brain forever and will be the first thing that i think of when i see Robin Williams now.
22550,"That Johnny Knoxville story made me smile. He seems like such a cool, laid back guy."
22551,"I've read a lot of Knoxville stories and pretty much since his daughter was born he became the man he is now. Just a genuinely nice guy. He also tries to be a role model and took roles in movies that are ""cleaner"" than his jackass days, and even his roles in jackass are a little less raunchy. Probably hurting himself though, that really changed him. He can only urinate through a cathedar because of an injury during jackass. I think he learned a valuable lesson. But what I really get from him is that he uses his fame for good."
22552,You rode The Haunted Mansion with Michael Clarke Duncan? I have never in my life had celebrity-encounter envy until now.
22553,"A friend of mine worked on the set of Tropic Thunder, and apparently Ben Stiller was a dick to everyone, he even fired someone because he thought they didn't put enough sugar in his coffee in between scenes, on the plus side though Jack Black was the nicest guy ever, and still emails my friend occasionally."
22554,"I have 2nd hand knowledge of a TON of Prince stories and they are fucking hilarious.  

Cliff's Notes version of a few gems:

* Shooting a video at a beach in Southern California.  Tide comes in.  Makes a huge deal and demands to ""talk to someone about this.""

* Fires an entire staff for failing to somehow get his little Artist Formerly Known As Prince symbol integrated internationally as a standard key on all computer keyboards.  

* At Paisley Studios, Prince wants to record a song right now.  Engineer goes to plug his keyboard in (musical kind.. not computer kind) and Prince in his impatience proclaims he doesn't need that shit.  Plays the song.  Asks engineer if he got that.  Engineer is like .. well.. no.  ""Why not!?""  'Well because you weren't plugged in""

* I like this one.  Prince calls into the studio from off-site to talk to someone there.  Young guy receptionist asks who's calling.  ""......  the boss of you.""

And many many more..

Edit:  Ok because a few people asked I posted a couple more anecdotes here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m8w6k/which_well_liked_celebrities_are_really_dicks_in/cc7o2q1"
22555,It's almost like he's just really really bored.
22556,"I used to be a bellboy so I saw tons of celebs act like complete dicks or really nice people. I once saw William Shatner charge a kid 100$ for an autograph because he was asking outside of the fan expo he was attending and then I heard rumor he was charging $100 inside anyways. Brian Adams treated me like a total pack mule just because he could and had me move 40 pieces of press junket boxes back and forth for a laugh. Terry Crews asked me for a book of matches and tipped me $20 and when I went to explain that it was too much he said he knew what he was giving, laughed and walked away. Gene Simmons had me hold a limo driver for 5 hours (losing other fares during a film festival) and then proceeded to jump in a cab at the door because the limo wouldn't take a horrendously low flat rate essentially fucking myself and the limo for peak tip/fare time. I could go on if you girls/guys are interested."
22557,"Terry Crews is the absolute motherfucking best, ever, in the history of everything, period"
22558,"I worked for Harrison Ford's son Ben in his restaurant that lasted a few years in town. I was 14 at the time and a busser. One night the restaurant is completely reserved by one party. Turns out Harrison was coming to eat at his son's place. So, as I am pouring everyone their water, I get to the person sitting right next to Harrison and the water pitcher spills everywhere (the ice decided that it had had enough of the pitcher, and all of it poured out at once). No water spilled on anyone, but I start apologizing profusely anyway. Harrison is laughing his ass off and tells me that it is ok, don't worry about, no water got an anyone. He was very nice about the whole thing."
22560,"Met Harrison Ford in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I'm from Mexico, we were at a private airstrip loading up an airplane onto a flatbed, out of nowhere this guy starts helping us. My co-worker tells me the guy is Harrison Ford I dismiss his remarks, upon further inspection I realize it is indeed Mr. Ford. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met. As a matter of fact he left and left his private hangar open for us to use any tools or whatever we needed. Keep in mind we were about 6 mexicans, I was the only english speaking one............Have commented this same story many times before."
22561,"I nannied for kids who went to school with Demi Lovato. apparently she used to be a huge bully, which is quite the opposite of what she preaches now."
22562,"A friend of mine worked on her Disney show.  He tells me that Demi was a huge ""I'm better than you"" bitch, difficult to work with, condescending, etc.  By contrast, my friend also worked with Selena Gomez whom he said was an absolute sweetheart."
22563,"A friend of mine worked Selena Gomez's tour as a sound engineer and also reported she was a sweetheart. When the tour wrapped, she threw the whole staff a party and gave everyone fully loaded ipads (this was maybe 1-2 months after the release of the first ipad mind you), a 100 dollar itunes gift card, and spend the time to talk to everybody 1-on-1 and thank them for their work.

He also worked for Justin Bieber's tour, and JB didn't do anything."
22564,"It makes me happy to see hear how nice of a person she is.

just goes to show you that being coddled at such a young age is no excuse to be an all around piece of shit, like so many young stars and starlets are."
22565,">  and spend the time to talk to everybody 1-on-1 and thank them for their work.

It's one thing to throw money at people, but it's a completely impressive thing to be at that age in that environment and recognize the value of respectful and decent human interaction. I don't know who Selena Gomez is, but that's pretty damned cool."
22566,"I'm happy Selena was a sweetheart, she comes across as one!"
22567,"My sister is friends with Demi. She's told me horrible things they used to do together. Demi was in fact a mean girl and her campaign for bullying was after she got famous and was called fat by fans. I've got so many stories about her. And the few times that I did meet her, she gave me such a ""I'm better than you"" feel."
22568,Stories please
22569,"It will please Reddit to know that Nicolas Cage is a delightful chap.  He recently moved to my city and I met him casually walking down the street. I had to say something( It's Nick Cage for Christ sake) so I gave him a simple,  ""Hey welcome to (city where I live), I hope you like it here."" The next thing I know he started telling me about all he had done since he had been in town.  which later evolved into a discussion on baseball. Real nice guy."
22570,"My family and I ran into Leslie Nielsen at a boardwalk when we were in New Jersey a few years ago. I had seen Airplane at that point but wasn't paying attention so my dad noticed him and introduced himself saying ""I like your movies"" to which Nielsen replied, ""So do I."" Then he quietly asked if he could get a picture with him. Nielsen happily obliged (picture's framed at home) while his significantly younger girlfriend scowled."
22571,Thank God. I don't think I could have handled it if he was a dick.
22572,Awesome. RIP.
22573,"You scared me for a minute there, my friend."
22574,"My friend is William Shatner's nephew. 

He was one of the most hated members of the family. Constantly berated his wife to tears, even while at family gatherings.

""Fuck Uncle Bill"" is all my friend would say about him, haha."
22576,"Tim Allen's character in ""Galaxy Quest"" is totally based on this experience right here."
22577,I worked for Chevy Chase once. Guy's a dick.
22578,Based on the stories I've heard after he left Community.. This isn't surprising.
22579,On the dvd commentaries for community the other actors politely trash trash talk him quite often
22580,So he literally *is* Pierce.
22581,"The guy who got famous with ""I'm Chevy Chase, and you're not"" is a dick? No way."
22582,"Ive heard some awful things about chevy chase, right from the mouths of some of his co stars such as will farrel and dan ackroyd. Apparently hes stubborn and all around an impossible guy. Hes a hard womanizer, once telling a female writer to give him a handjob backstage. He has even exchanged punches with Bill Murray backstage once. 

Edit: Because I found no evidence of Chase being physical with a woman"
22584,"To be honest, getting kicked awake by Chevy Chase would be a pretty great story to tell people."
22585,"""I been kicked out of nicer houses than this!"""
22586,"Lol yeah, I'm not sure this one is on Chevy being a dick."
22587,Medium talent! MEDIUM TALENT!
22588,Baltimore here.  Michael phelps has been a douche since before winning all those medals
22589,"Once had the opportunity to meet Samuel L. Jackson at the golf course I worked at in TX. He is an absolute joy to be around. He tried to stay low key and not have people go out of their way for him. Just when he was leaving after I cleaned off his clubs my buddy asked if he could say ""his line"" from Snakes on a Plane. I can say that was the only time I was happy to hear someone say ""Get those motha fuckin' clubs, in my motha fuckin' car!""

tl;dr Samuel L. Jackson - Confirmed badass in real life."
22590,"Michael Jordan... Regarded as the GOAT, still a huge ass"
22591,"Ugh, I remember a story on here a few months ago about him. The person's friend, this small asian woman, was a huge fan of his. She saw him in Vegas taking pictures with all of these hot women and walked up to ask for an autograph. Completely ignoring her is dickish enough, but on top of that he put his hand on her face, pushed her out of his way and walked off."
22592,The worst part of that story was her carrying around the basketball card of him everywhere she went waiting for the day and this being what happened. I shed a small tear over that story.
22594,"Oh god... I... I used to idolize this guy

Edit: MJs PR agent deleted the comment above mine probably."
22595,Imagine how I feel.  I bought Hanes!
22596,And here's [Chamillionare's Michael Jordan Story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ZQERHL6ow)
22597,"Two things I love pointing out about this story. 

1. Chamillionaire's refrain from cursing. ""I don't wanna curse. He was like 'I don't give a ffffff... Nigga!'""

2. He straight up admits MJ would've probably knocked his ass out."
22598,"Between this and Charmillionaire's support for the Weird Al parody, I love this guy."
