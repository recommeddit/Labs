23856,"For close to sim-racing you're options are pretty lacking on Switch. Check out GRID Autuosport as that is probably the best, especially if you want to race against other cars. If you're OK with racing without other people then the WRC games are fantastic and allow tons of customization. But it's only rally racing and you don't race against other drivers."
23857,Car X drift racing
23858,"Yeah it's a big hole in the switch marketplace. Not without reason: no analog triggers, sim racing games are often quite demanding since they all try to be gorgeous, etc.

Gear Club Unlimited exists, but it's very simple and probably not worth your time honestly.

So uh... I mean XCloud sure is coming along well if you've got the network reliability for it lmao (either way you can test Game Pass Ultimate for a month for $1, so it's not exactly a huge investment to test). That has dang near every sim racing game on the market that isn't exclusive to another platform. 

Unfortunate that I gotta recommend a whole other platform to ya, but yeah it's a real big hole in the Switch library."

23861,Monster was a hell of a watch. Just finished it like a month back. Good pick
23862,"Ive had someone suggest this to me saying that if I loved Elfen Lied, I'd love Monster. 

Would you say this is a pretty good assumption? I have a long ass watch list, but I've jumped a few anime ahead because people told me specifically that I'd like them because I liked Elfen Lied. (Serial Experiments Lain, and Mirai Nikki)"
23863,"No, they have nothing in common except airing same year."
23864,So I guess that person just really wanted me to watch monster then?
23865,Monster is a long show with like 70 episodes but itâ€™s really good. Iâ€™d recommend saving it for a rainy day when you want to binge something intense and mysterious with characters that are never thrown away no matter how small they might seem

23872,Have u seen it
23873,If u haven't seen it and saying this bro u are lame
23874,"I have watched it, and I am inclined to agree. It is too long that it gets boring. I have watched to episode 986, and I am tired. However, I am still too invested to let it go."
23875,U clearly haven't watched it bro.. U can stop lying now
23876,"Haha. We are in the Wano Arc. Big mom is yet to be introduced to the Kaido Pirates. Apoo is currently fighting Captain Kid, Luffy, and Zoro. Luffy and Zoro could not figure how to defend.   


Luffy got mad over red bean soup and blew their cover. But yes, we are still lying. One piece is a 7 at best."
23877,Yeah bro idk how you got this.. But if you seriously think one piece is just 7 at its best u clearly haven't watched it.. It's rated #3 on MAL and #2 at Anilist..
23878,"I know, because I have watched every episode. They used disguises to get into the party. They then discarded them when they started fighting. Oh, Jimbei and Robin were the sober ones in the attack. The next episode will focus on Sanji and his weakness for women. There are better animes than One Piece."
23879,One piece is my favorite anime/manga of all time and I strongly disagree with your opinions but you are entitled to one so I respect it and if everybody liked one thing who would be there to argue about it ðŸ™ƒ
23880,"you watched every episode but itâ€™s not good? so youâ€™re just torturing yourself to watch it or what you mean to say is you loved it enough to invest in the series, and because of the pacing, you want to steer people away? shame on you dude. thereâ€™s a reason someone will invest this much time into a single series and itâ€™s not to throw dirt on the reason you even watched that many episodes in the first place. pacing is bad, just read the manga then."
23881,"One piece was the anime that got me in to anime but after watching re zero, naruto, code geas, Elfen lied, another, attack on Titans, jujutsu Kaiden , and so many more one piece after watching until luffy defeating katakuri and sanji crying in the rain because of the betrayal one piece is average. I had more fun watching"
23882,Exactly. One-piece is average compared to the animes you mentioned.
23883,jujutsu kaisen is one of the worst if not the worst anime I've ever seen. the ONLY thing good is the animation style lol besides that it has the most dog aids story I've ever watched. Overpowered characters everywhere with no explanation except eating an old finger. that show blew chunks

thats the end of this depression filled list"
23912,"Boy, you seem like you really wanna cry your eyes out. I'd suggest Elfen Lied, but that may just break you."
23913,I'll give this a try
23914,"Hold on a sec before you do that. 

I suggest you watch the English Dub, because the voice acting and audio is better and improved, and the writing is better. And before you watch it you should know it is more than just depressing like Your Lie, pancreas, or Silent Voice.

Elfen Lied is know to be more than just depressing but actually emotionally break people and is psychologically disturbing. It's known to really fuck with people's heads for a long time. 

You may not want to watch it out of nowhere, I'd wait till you're in a reasonable state of mind.

(Also the OVA is a must watch, though it's voice acting is pretty bad. It's Episode 10.5)"
23915,"Wow, really? I see it on a few of these lists, but have no idea what it is. This makes it seem interesting and scary as hell at the same time."
23916,"Scary? No, It's not a horror in the traditional sense. It's psychologically damaging though, it's a traumatic experience to say the least. If you're afraid of that sort of thing, thats fair.

Elfen Lied is still pretty infamous for being incredibly depressing, but beyond that it's traumatic because it's very psychologically destructive and uses violence in a fashion to highlight it's philosophical ideas and painful emotions.

It deals with a lot of very dark, and very difficult to grasp and complex emotional problems people have, and it deals with severe emotional mental trauma and heavy handed topics like Discrimination and nature versus nurture.

It's probably the only piece of media I've ever encountered that actually empathizes with the negative emotional states that bullying puts people in. 

I've never seen anything else like it.

I know plenty of people who've been dramatically impacted by the series, including myself. For some people, Elfen Lied hit like a freight train and broke them, changed their personality, or otherwise left them with a hole in their heart that's hard to really describe. 

But it's also a niche experience. Some people it breaks them emotionally, Some people just dont respond to it what so ever. 

Many scenes in Elfen Lied can change depending on your emotional state, perception, and familiarity with the series too. 

As much as I love Elfen Lied and have picked it apart and learned about it inside and out, I also have come to  realized that I cant just recommend it ad hoc because for some people it can be a really damaging experience.

The biggest problem is that you never know how someone is going to react to it. So I always suggest it or leave people with a word of caution before they watch it because I don't want to be the person who shares a traumatic experience without warning."
23917,I'll keep this in mind and i do feel bad while watching  shows like these but i have never cried of sadness or felt depression till date one of the reasons i like rom coms and depressing stuff lets hope i atleast cry at this thanks for the suggestion though

1-5 are fairly set in stone, but 5-10 could all switch spots fairly easily, plus there are some shows I couldn't add there either but are close enough to top 10 that they could be there easily too, like Kaguya-sama or Code Geass."

24004,"Hmm, ""Must watch"", or ""favourites""? They're slightly different, as the former will tend to be more accessible stuff with a broader base appeal that can then be built upon once the viewer is familiar with the tropes and conventions of the medium.

For the former: 

______________

**[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate):**

* *Trailer:* [English dubbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaOvEIkeyzU) for the first half. If you don't mind spoilers in your trailers, [this AMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub5iP0GQ5QA) is fantastic.

* *What it's about:* Okabe Rintarou is a self-proclaimed ""Mad Scientist"", living primarily on Ramen noodles and Dr Pepper while building wacky inventions with his otaku friend Daru. Things take a turn for the weird when he discovers that one of his stranger creations apparently functions as a time machine capable of sending messages into the past. And just when he thinks he's beginning to get a handle on his new reality, things begin to unravel, leaving him racing to pick up the pieces before they're lost entirely.

* *Why watch it?:* Steins;Gate is really two shows stitched into one. The first half is a fairly entertaining slice-of-life drama following a cast of larger-than-life characters bouncing ideas and banter off against one another. The second half is much darker, exploring the consequences of actions taken earlier in the story and driving towards a car crash of a conclusion.

* *Caveats:* The first half of the show is fairly slow. Entertaining, but slow. It's not until the half-way mark that things really start to pick up. Stick with it - the journey and the end are both worth it. The follow-up OVA and movie, however, are ""take-it-or-leave-it"". They nominally progress the story a little after the conclusion, but everything was pretty neatly tied up in the show's finale.

* *Similar works:* **Madoka Magica** springs to mind for a number of reasons. **Robotics;Notes** is set in the same world and has many similarities, but it isnâ€™t *quite* as good as Steins;Gate. The manga **Murasakiiro no Qualia** is definitely worth checking out if you enjoyed this. â€ƒ

___________________

**[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood):**

* *Trailer:* [Dubbed version]( http://www.madman.com.au/videos/view/2141/fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood).

* *What it's about:* The magic of alchemy makes many things possible, but there is one ironclad rule: for everything you gain, something of equal value must be sacrificed. Edward and Alphonse Elric made a mistake in their youth and paid a horrific cost. Now they seek to regain what they lost by searching for the mythical ""Philosopher's Stone"", an artifact that nullifies the rule of ""equivalent exchange"".

* *Why watch it?:* For one, it's the highest-rated anime series of all time. And for good reason. An expertly woven story of sacrifice, love and duty, populated by a wide cast of interesting and memorable characters, Fullmetal Alchemist blends action and humour with a deep plot in a fully-realised fictional world. And, just as requested, it concludes with a solid **bang**, leaving no loose ends.

* *Caveats:* The humour leans heavily towards slapstick and super-deformed ""chibi"" characters. While the primary and secondary cast are all well-developed, there remain a significant number of one-note side characters that pop up repeatedly, testing your patience with how far the writers are willing to stretch a single joke.

* *Theme(s):* Family. Guilt, hatred, and self-hatred, and how they feed into a cycle of violence. The importance of sacrifice.

* *Similar works:* The original 2003 adaptation of **[Fullmetal Alchemist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist)** is an obvious choice. While set in the same world and given the same start, the two stories deviate wildly after a certain point. It also spends a lot more time on the first act of the story, fleshing out many incidents that Brotherhood glossed over in the interest of time.â€ƒ

__________________

**[Ghost in the Shell](http://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Ghost_in_the_Shell)**

* *Trailer:* [DVD trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvBVDibOrgs)

* *What it's about:* The year is 2029 and the world has been fundamentally changed by the ongoing digital revolution. Cybernetics and mind uploading has become common-place, and those with the ability to hack into such systems are regarded as national assets. The story follows a group of police officers trying to track down one such hacker, a person known only as ""The Puppetmaster"".

* *Why watch it:* Ghost in the Shell is one of the true classics of the entire medium. It's a must-see if you want to understand how anime got to the way it is today. The animation stands up surprisingly well for a series that's almost twenty years old, and the plot masterfully combines action and philosophy without a single stumble. The soundtrack, aesthetic, and plot ideas have inspired dozens if not hundreds of copycat attempts.

* *Caveats:* The animation *does* hold up well, but it's nonetheless obvious that this is an older work, particularly with regards to sound design. 

* *Themes:* Mind/Body duality. The nature of consciousness and the soul

* *Similar works:* **[Akira](http://myanimelist.net/anime/47/Akira)**, **[Psycho-Pass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13601/Psycho-Pass)**, **[Bubblegum Crisis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1347/Bubblegum_Crisis)**. Outside of anime, **Blade Runner** and **Neuromancer.**

_________________

**[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note)**

* *Trailer:* [Dubbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J6CIpoYCV0)

* *What it's about*: One day, a hyperintelligent but bored teenager finds a notebook with a set of instructions attached: write someone's name in the book while thinking of their face, and they will die. He immediately sets about trying to use this new power to ""purify"" the world of all criminals and set up a new social order with himself at the head. In the process, he ends up pitting his wits against an equally brilliant detective trying to put a stop to the ongoing murders.

* *Why you should watch it?*: Death Note is a cornerstone of modern anime; it's one of the few shows almost universally regarded as a decent entry-point into the medium. The story is gripping, fast-paced, and full of twists and turns. Light Yagami is one of the most expert renderings of a descent into sociopathy that I've seen in modern fiction, and his conflict with L is endlessly fascinating. The show is the closest anime has come to ""Breaking Bad"".

* *Caveats*: The first thing people talk about when it comes to Death Note is the endless ""PLOT TWIST""s - a certain level of suspension of disbelief is required with regards to some of what goes on. The second thing everybody will talk about is that the latter half is noticeably weaker than the early material. It's true that there's a sudden lurch in the pacing after a particularly critical event, and plot holes begin to build up in the race to the finish-line. But if you're willing to roll with it, Death Note remains solidly entertaining from start to end.

* *Theme(s):* Corruption of power. Ennui and hubris.

* *Similar works:* Plotwise, **[Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch)**.  **[Zankyou no Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)** has a similar dynamic to it. 

______________________

**[Code Geass:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch)**

* *Trailer:* [English Dub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKAwzRuLKi0)

* *What it's about*: Japan is subjugated by the oppressive Britannian Empire, its name changed to the Orwellian ""Area 11"" and its people treated as second-class citizens. One day, a hyper-intelligent school-boy serendipitously receives the supernatural ability to enforce obedience to a single command on anyone he sees. With no other resources, how can you leverage this power into toppling a world-spanning empire?

* *Why watch it?*: Going by the numbers, the standard protagonist for this setting would be Suzaku, an optimistic, ""things will change if I try hard enough!"" boyscout of a character. This is not his story. Instead, the focus is on Lelouche, a scheming, underhanded plotter who is entirely willing to justify his means by his ends. Unlike a lot of action-heavy shows, the primary focus of Code Geass is at the *strategic* level - the protagonist is explicitly *not* a fighter but a thinker, a planner. And the plots just keep getting crazier and crazier as the series progresses. The finale is widely regarded as one of the most cathartic in any anime, though the story contorts itself at times to get to that point.

* *Caveats*: The fighting is based on mecha, which automatically turns some people off. The school-based sections are blatant filler and often feel a little forced. The level of fan-service is quite high, with more than a few extraneous lingering boob shots. The ""twists upon twists"" can break suspension of disbelief, if you're not willing to extend much of it. Finally, the character designs are pretty stylised - you get used to them, but they're pretty noticeable at the start.

* *Primary theme(s)*: How best to fix a broken system: Reform vs Revolution. Do the ends justify the means?

* *Similar works:* In order of ""dark"" to ""light"" stories: **[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note)**, **[Guilty Crown](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10793/Guilty_Crown)**, **[Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon)**, **[No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)**"
24005,"Wow... these are pretty much my favorites, except for Ghost in the Shell, which I guess I will be watching next."
24006,I need to watch all of these
24007,"Here are some of my top choices; though they vary in genre, all are definite must-watches:

* [Tsuritama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama) - Whimsical, bright, heartwarming with a touch of poignancy. It's the kind of show you want on a relaxed summer day (or a cold fall/winter day in which you long for summer). It's stunningly beautiful and a completely satisfying experience from beginning to end. When I'm down, it's my go-to pick-me-up. 

* [Welcome to the NHK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!) - It's seriously a life changing kind of anime. You will bust a gut laughing, all while perhaps crying at the same time. It is a positively brilliant anime that manages to hit at some dark and deeply rooted aspects of the human condition, and takes you through an emotional, tumultuous, hilarious, unexpected journey that really hits home, but also leaves you thoroughly entertained. The English dub is also a pretty great dub; either sub or dub are great experiences.

* [Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!) - Baccano! is a brilliant action-packed anime that has some of the most complex, but rewarding, storytelling I've seen. It's a very 'smart' anime that will definitely need to be paid attention to as the different pieces start intertwining and coming together, but man is it ridiculously satisfying. The plot is fantastic and told in an interesting way, and the wide cast of lovable albeit crazy (some borderline insane) characters really makes the show. It's a wild ride. Plus, the English dub is one of the better ones out there, so if you're one to debate between the two, both are great experiences. If anything, the English dub almost adds the extra flair to the 1930s New York underground kind of setting.

* [Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!) - Okay, so it's another anime by the same guy who wrote Baccano! -- but it, too, is a brilliantly told story. It's got the same marks of a wide cast of crazy characters, an interesting bridge of genre, great animation and music and absolutely masterful storytelling. I will say Durarara!! can seem to start off a bit slow, as pieces seem disjointed, but when you stick through it and once the pieces start coming together, it brings everything together fantastically. Another great dub. Both sub/dub are great experiences--and there's a second season to look forward to pretty soon!

* [Daily Lives of High School Boys](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) - I'm a lover of comedy. So a lot of my suggestions are comedy-related. And this particular anime is something everyone must, must, must see. There's really not much of a plot. The anime is told in minute-long vignettes of sorts that really just set up and execute jokes. It's hilarious, ridiculously dry humor that is sure to make you laugh (maybe even out of shared experience, eh?). You just have to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCa0eh-I1iQ) to believe, I suppose. Here are some more [sticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL0zWuQXh1E) and [frankfurters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ck-k4XSqOI) if you're not convinced yet.

* [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) or [The Devil is a Part-Timer](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!)- Speaking of comedy, I'm just having a hard time being really decisive right now, so I'm putting in two that are just must-watch comedies. Gekkan Shoujo is a recently aired summer anime that just finished -- it's just ridiculously hilarious. If you're looking at it going ""That looks like another shouj--"" NO. It's bust-a-gut laughing. As for The Devil is a Part-timer, it tends to read more like a sitcom - great play on fantasy-meets-real-world cliche, and such dry, situational humor.

I realized I put in a lot of comedy-type suggestions in there. But I suppose it will balance out the other great suggestions in this thread. My top anime tend to shift a lot depending on my mood, though I will say that Tsuritama, Welcome to the NHK, Daily Lives, and Drrr!! always tend to be definites up there; the other slots are still great, but interchangeable."
24008,"Muh brotha.

Baccano!, Durarara!! and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou are some of my favourite anime.

We seem to have similar taste in comedy so I'll just add your other suggestions as 'plan to watch' in MAL.

If you haven't yet, I'd recommend watching Cromartie Highschool and Gin no Saji (the second season of Gin no Saji is pretty bad though)."
24009,"Ha, yes! We really do have similar tastes; Cromartie HS and Gin no Saji have been on my PTW for quite a while. I've watched several episodes of both; but you know how it is...there's a ridiculous backflow of things to watch and all of a sudden you realize you didn't finish what you meant to and watched other things you didn't plan...but I shall return and rectify this immediately!"
24010,The second season of Gin no Saji is bad? How? The second season is so much better! It's one of the most realistic Shounen series out there!
24011,"This *was* two months ago, but...

In any case, people have different tastes, and I understand it. Now, ""realism"" isn't what I'm looking for in an anime, and I think most people would agree with me. My characters don't look real and do all sorts of things that no normal person would ever do. I like it when a series tries to be realistic on some aspect and achieves it successfully, but being realistic isn't a big merit on itself, IMO.

That said, I didn't like the pacing and I felt that romance overshadowed what I thought was the strongest element in the series (i.e. comedy).

I went too far by saying it's ""pretty bad"", in fact, I gave it a 7 (although I probably should've given it a 6). It's still worth watching, but unlike the first one, it didn't have me laughing all the time, and the romance and drama weren't good enough to take the place comedy had taken in the first one. Partly because some of the comic-relief is really mood-breaking."
24012,Loved Baccano
24013,"* [Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) - Sci Fi Thriller. This is my favorite series, It starts of slow, but after a certain moment everything goes into overdrive and it will be an emotional rollercoaster till the last episode. The plot and characters are both amazing, and it also has a surprisingly good romance.

* [Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) - Psychological thriller. I won't say much about this, because otherwise I would spoil it. This anime has an amazing story and is not at all what it seems. Watch at least 3/4 episodes before dropping this, it's worth it.

* [Mawaru Penguindrum](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum) - Psychological mystery. Giving a synopsis of this anime is impossible, the  MAL description is the best you can get. It again has a very good story, told with a lot of symbolism and metaphors, which means you have to pay attention the entire time. It is about life, death, fate and changing fate.

* [Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) - supernatural drama/horror. This is about 5 children living in a utopia a 1000 years in the future, but not everything is as it seems. This series starts of quite slow, but that is because it begins with its amazing worldbuilding. The last 4/5 episodes are completely worth everything. 
There are a few infamous scenes around episode 8, which caused some people to drop the anime, don't do that. Those scenes are completely explained within the lore, and will lessen after a few episodes.

* [AnoHana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.) - supernatural drama. If you want an emotional anime, watch this one. It tells the story of a group of childhood friends who, after the death of one of them, slowly grow apart. Suddenly, one of them can see that friend again, who will only go away if her last wish is completed. The problem, she doesn't know what that wish was anymore. This is a beautiful story about loss and the different ways to cope with it. It's ending is almost guaranteed to make you cry.

* [Gurren Lagann](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann) - action mech. Want something mindblowingly epic, something over the top awesome. Look no further. This anime is the definition of over the top. As one character in the show says, kick logic to the curb and do the impossible. Turn of your brain and enjoy this epic show, with the most manly character ever created.

If you want to know more about one of these shows, just ask me."
24014,"> with the most manly character ever created                    
                                       
[say what?](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19821/694167-armstrong.jpg)"
24015,This would be the quintessential 'starter pack' of anime. If you're going to introduce anime to someone a lot those shows would be recommended for first time watchers.
24016,"Bad idea, they won't be able to watch the other good/decent anime if they start with god-tier ones. They will find themselves in need of atleast on par or a better anime than the ones mentioned above."
24017,Sell me Steins;gate. I see lot's of people recommend it but based off the synopsis it doesn't seem like my thing. I feel like i may be missing something.
24018,"I'm not that good at this, but I'll try.

What I liked most about Steins;Gate is that is has some of everything. Do you like comedy? S;G has a lot of it, especially at the beginning. Do you like romance? S;G has an excellent romance. Most of all, do you like a conclusive story without any big plotholes? S;G has it. 

It's amazing story is probably its main selling point. The plot is very well thought out and doesn't really have any plotholes, it is a complete story. It is also an emotional story. After a certain point, it will become an emotional rollercoaster till the last episode. 

None of the characters are completely standard, they always have something that makes them different from the standard stereotypes. Especially Okabe and Kurisu are well developed. Both look like stereotypical characters at the start, but they are anything but, as you'll find out.

Another thing is, the science behind what is happening is explained quite well, and without any big errors in the physics parts. Of course it's impossible in real life, but it cleverly uses real physical theories, that are already used in those circumstances.

Of course, it does start of slow. I didn't really mind, but S;G is almost two shows in one. About the first half is almost a SoL comedy, while the second half is the Sci-fi mystery. It is mostly the second half that causes people to praise it.

All in all, I probably like S;G so much because it feels so complete to me. It is always possible that it is just not your thing though, but you should at least try if you have some free time and watch it."
24019,à² _à²  Great now i have to watch Steins;gate
24020,Yes.  Yes you do.
24025,Haven't anywhere near finished but i'm hooked
24022,"People say the first half is slow, but I was hooked from the start.  Glad you're enjoying it so far."
24023,OP you gotta come back and tell us what you thought once you finish!
24024,RemindMe! 5 days
24026,OP what about now? its been a month!
24027,Oh yeah i finished it like 2 weeks ago then i marathoned blue exorcist last weekend and now im on physcopass season 2 then highschool dxd 2
24028,How good was Stein Gate? I just finished it today and wow it was amazing.
24029,"It was great, wouldve loved if they went more in depth on the dystopian future, but other than that i have no complaints"
24030,With regards to Shinsekai Yorki I got to episode 10 and I just couldn't do it anymore. It wasn't for me personally and often times I had to force myself to go on. I think that by Ep 10 if you haven't gotten me engaged it's kind of too late.
24031,"Yeah, Shinsekai Yori certainly isn't for everyone, and tbh, the worldbuilding only stops after 16 episodes, with the 17th episode being the start of the real story."
24032,"No particular order

24033,I agree w this so much only I'd have to put Ghost in the Shell on there.
24034,Something that i've been meaning to watch :)
24035,Recently watched it and idk if this will help convince you but my opinion on it is that it's a very solid all around anime. It's not exactly amazing in any area but watching it I never felt like they did anything bad or poor. It was a 7 or 8 in my book but it was very very solid all around. I recommend it highly.
24036,I feel they approach the sci-fi genre in anime better than most. I find the best sci-fi the ones that don't focus on the the action. I find they cover some really interesting topics in the show and movie. Inspired the matrix so that's saying something :P
24037,"I like your list because it has something for everyone in it. Also you listed 5 of my favourite anime shows I've seen, especially happy to see Eureka Seven. Haven't seen Steins;Gate yet but it's something I've been meaning to get around to."
24038,"Steins;gate is a must. I'll be honest and say that the first 8 to 9 episodes were a bit silly and painful, unless you enjoy the more light hearted stuff, but after that its just incredible :)"
24039,"Fantastic List! Based on the rest of your taste, I'd say Eureka Seven is my next-watch!"
24040,EUREKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 7!
24041,"Eureka Seven and dat ending, though. If that had been my first anime I woulda flipped a table."
24042,"twas my first :p loved it too

* Tengen Toppa
* Black Lagoon
* Arakawa Under the Bridge
* Mirai Nikki"
24050,"This list may contain spoilers, so read at your own risk. You have been warned.

* Monogatari Series - Romance, Supernatural, Mystery - This is my all time favourite anime series. It currently has five instalments, being [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) > [Nisemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11597/Nisemonogatari) > [Nekomonogatari: Kuro](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15689/Nekomonogatari:_Kuro) > [Monogatari Series: Second Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season) > [Hanamonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21855/Hanamonogatari), in that order.

  The series will seem very strange at first, as the animation style is very unique. However, after a few episodes you will become used to it and welcome it with open arms. 

  The main selling point for this anime series is the characters. Every character is well-written and likeable, and they are also some of the most unique characters I've seen. The story and romance subplot are also very good. 

  This anime may not be everyone's cup of tea, though, as it is heavily focused around dialogue, and most of the time spent is listening to the conversations between characters or narration. 

* [Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) -  Mystery, Psychological, Thriller - Death Note is a very interesting anime. It forces the watcher to overcome the moral dilemma presented in the show to decide how they will enjoy it. If one sides with the main character, they are able to root for him and enjoy his actions, but on the other side of the spectrum, those who do not side with the main character are still able to enjoy it just as much because of the long lasting suspense and intensity of the story. 

  The characters in this anime are absolutely amazing, and are incredibly well made. There is one thing to note, however, which is that it is widely perceived to drop in quality after the first arc ends. While I somewhat agree with that statement, it is up for you to decide, as it is still rather good.

* [Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) (And [Code Geass Season 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2904/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2)) - Super Power, Mecha, Action, Drama, Psychological - The main character in this anime is suddenly given a very strange yet incredibly useful power, and decides to use it for good, or rather his perception of good. It is similar to Death Note in the sense that the watcher will either agree with the main characters actions, or disagree with them. 

  This is yet another anime where the characters and story are the incredible. You will feel all kinds of emotions when you watch this anime and you not be able to tell right from wrong at some points. It also has potentially one of the greatest, if not the greatest, ending to an anime that I will ever see.

* [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) - Romance, Drama, Music, Slice of Life - White Album 2 has no correlation with White Album. You do not need to watch the first to be able to understand the second.

  White Album 2 is an anime that will seem like a typical slice of life anime but with somewhat interesting characters. It denounces that thought throughout the series, and becomes one of the most unique romance stories with fantastic characters I've seen. 

  This anime will probably leave you with mixed feelings towards the end. The characters that you like may end up doing something that you'll question and make you wonder if they really are the character you liked.


*  [Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/Mirai_Nikki_\(TV\)) - Mystery, Psychological, Thriller - The story to Mirai Nikki is outstanding. The plot is interesting right from the start, and only seems to increase in intensity it as the episodes continue. The main character is constantly placed in difficult situations where time is limited, and sometimes you will hate him for the decisions he makes. 

  While I don't particularly think that most of the main cast in this anime are all that great, the ones that are, are ridiculously good. You may not like some of them, but they are written amazingly well.

* [Clannad](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad) and [Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) - Drama, Romance, Slice of Life, Comedy - If there is one romance anime that you watch, it has to be this one. The art style will probably turn you away at first, but I urge you to stick around for the story and characters.

  In order to truly understand this anime and get the best out of this anime, you will need to watch Clannad before After Story, even though you can get away with watching only After Story.

  Clannad starts off as a normal school-set slice of life, with some quite good comedy here and there, but this part of the series is here to let you get used to the characters, and set up the story for Clannad: After Story. However, it is still rather emotional at some points.

  Clannad: After Story continues the story from Clannad, and while the story for this one wont be as comedic as the previous instalment, it is still somewhat funny. However, it will build up your emotions for the main characters and then thoroughly rip your heart out numerous times. Some people say they did not cry while watching this anime, and they are either liars or they have no heart.


This list wasn't in any order, and I'm not even sure why I made such long descriptions for each one, but take a gander if you want. I've probably sewn some bullshit in there, so send me a comment if you think anything's a bit iffy."

24052,I like how you said not Shippuden. I acknowledge it.
24053,"Damn! Forgot to put Evangelion on my list! 

Can I ask why naruto (not shippuden)?"
24054,"I can't speak for OP but I think Naruto, before Shippuden, had this special charm to it that's hard to describe. The characters and plots were simple enough for kids and newcomers to anime to understand, but the story didn't feel shallow (besides the obscene amount of filler). When Shippuden started, I felt like they wanted to cater to a more adult audience and introduced all these convoluted and interconnected plot lines and it was missing that charm from the first series. Also they started adding too many characters to care about. The original Naruto reminds me of all the time I spent when I was younger talking to my best friend about our favorite characters or story arcs and how we would act out fight scenes on his trampoline (we were lame I know). I personally wouldn't outright put it on a list of ""must see"" anime, but it's good for what it's trying to be."
24055,"That makes sense.  And I agree for the most part except that I think it was the manga that changed. 

Also, you could say the same thing (albeit to a lesser extent)  about Harry Potter"
24056,"See in my eyes, once all the new plot twists happened, and the many so called ""fillers"" that helped you understand the history of naruto and many others. has been amazing up to todays newest episode. Watching Naruto every thursday after work for a while now! haha."

24060,Tenchi Muyo and DBZ got me into Anime back in the day
24061,"I'll go ahead and throw mine in. This does raise an interesting question that I've discussed before; is there a difference between ""must watch"" and ""top anime""? IMO there is, and the defining difference in what makes an anime ""must watch"" is it's influence on the medium and it's fans. 

1. [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) - Perhaps the most influential anime to come out in the last 2 decades and one of the most influential of all time. It appears to be a mecha anime on the surface, but it is not really about the mecha. The focus of this anime is on the psyches of it's characters and how having the responsibility of protecting the world effects them. Because of it's influence on the medium, extremely high level of popularity, the amount of discussion it creates in the fandom, and it's critical acclaim, I consider this to be *by far* the biggest must-watch for any anime fan. That said, it is a polarizing anime and although there are many that love it, there are many others that hate it. Love it or hate it, you still must watch it.

2. [Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) - Extremely popular and critically acclaimed. You may think this is a cutesy magical girl anime, but appearances can be deceiving. It's best to watch this anime while knowing as little about it as possible, and also to watch it as quickly as possible because spoiler-filled discussions about it occur daily in most online anime communities. Well regarded for it's fantastic story, excellent OST, and beautiful art-style, it's an anime that does so many things excellent and may as close to flawless in it's execution as any anime in existence. That said, it's not an anime with universal appeal so you shouldn't just assume you'll love it...in fact you might hate it. It is important though to understand why others love it as much as they do so you can have a civilized discussion about it with others. 

You listed AOT and FMA: Brotherhood, which despite my not liking them as much as my first 2 entries, are anime I also consider to be among the top 6 in my ""must watch"" list. Discussion about AOT is starting to fade though so it may fall off that list in the future. In fact, I should probably include something like Steins;Gate instead, because even though it's older and not ongoing, I see it mentioned more often than AOT. FMA: Brotherhood belongs on the list because of it's popularity and has near universal appeal. Unlike Madoka and Evangelion, almost nobody hates FMA, so it's extremely likely anyone could enjoy that anime. 

My final 2 are [Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) because it is considered a classic, is very popular, and is almost universally recognized as being excellent and [Hayao Miyazaki's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki#Filmography) top movies, which include Spirited Away, Mononoke Hime, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and others. Hayao Miyazaki is one of, if not the most influential people involved in making anime during the past half century. His movies have a very wide appeal so they are quite popular, and for the most part also get a large degree of critical acclaim."
24062,"Yeah definetly watch Madoka Magica knowing as little as possible. I didn't know the plot, but I went in knowing what to expect and honestly it was incredibly disappointing after hearing all the hype surrounding it."
24063,"My list, I like action anime.

Neon Genesis Evangelion | Mech Anime on the surface, but much much more psychologically involved. It is probably the best anime I've ever seen. Be sure to watch the movies after you watch the series, they retell the story in different ways.
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann | Mech anime, sort of. It's pretty much a nonstop hype train from start to finish with some feels sprinkled throughout.
Sword Art Online | Sci-fi online sword combat. Great animation and also decent story for the first half of the season. The story drags a bit during the second half of the first, but picks back up in the second season. 
Samurai Champloo | Action/Comedy great animation and great story. Set in feudal Japan.
Guilty Crown | Sci-fi drama wonderful animation and soundtrack and great story. Some claim it trails weak off at the end, but I disagree. Many feels to be had in this one.
Code Geass | Sci-fi Drama Mecha The mechs take a bit of a back seat from the foreground of the show, which is the amazing story. It's like one big chess game filled with action, surprise, and sadness."

Cowboy Bebop â€“ The first series I ever watched and the one thatâ€™s started my addition. Slick savvy and very very cool

Kill la Kill â€“ Spectacular, over the top, and great fun.

* **[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) & [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16001/Kokoro_Connect:_Michi_Random)**: This supernatural Slice of Life had me hook, line, and sinker.  I loved every minute of its complex view into the problems that you face when you lose the ability to maintain your privacy.
* **[Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!)**:  This show was one that hit me completely out of left field.  It had a stark juxtaposition of comedy, action, twisted plots, and super interesting characters.  One of the first that I watched and definitely a favorite.


* **[Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/) & [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16762/Mirai_Nikki_Redial)**: This show is twisted, and I love it.  Such a great concept and the whole interaction by Yuki & Yuno made the experience.  
* **[Angel Beats](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!)**: This anime... It switches gears from comedy to romance, drama to music, with such sleekness that you never expect it, when it happens.  And just thinking about certain parts makes me smile, while others make me tear up. 

**Tied...**:

* **[Lovelyâ˜…Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2034/Lovely%E2%98%85Complex)**: 
This RomCom has such a great chemistry between the two main characters and how their relationship develops.
* **[Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time)**: This is the anime that got me into the romance genre.  So I am a little biased towards this one.  I admit the ghost Banri was annoying, but it helped push certain plot points during the series.  But really the romance between Banri and Kouko really pulled at  my heartstrings."

24095,"I'm doing this based on how much i feel like anime have effected the community not necessarily how good they are (im putting this here just for one in particular and seasoned anime fans already know what it is.)

In order of what i have seen to what i haven't but not ranked in any particular order:

Clannad + Afterstory: If someone asks me what show has effected me the most, i would say it's this one. This show is powerful and known throughout the community for a good reason. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and If you like romance, it's an absolute must see. If someone in the anime community says ""feels"" I guarantee this show comes into mind. It's not perfect but I definitely think it is one of the best of it's kind. Although not ""original"" because there are a ton of shows that have been done with high school and drama and whatever... This show does go one step further and that one step is one huge ride. This show is over 10 years old and it looked beautiful and it still does to this day. It is a classic.

Steins;Gate: Damn this show was so amazing. I don't think there is quite another like it. It uses real life events and with it being so recent it looks amazing. The characters are all memorable, lovable, and the story is near unforgettable because of how original it is. Maybe time travel isn't exactly ""original"" but what they do with it is completely unique. It is where it is on MAL for a reason.

Higurashi no naku koro ni + Kai: Unfortunately for this show, most people don't know that there even is a second season because it was never released outside Japan. This is a statement i'm sure will get refuted but I would say that this show is the pinnacle of the horror genre in anime. I would also say that it is one of the best adaptations of a VN there is because of how much it stays like a VN. This show will confuse those who just watch it at first but once everything falls into place it really puts in that ""Holy s**t."" factor when the second season starts rolling around and explaining things. The show operates in a time loop, where shit goes down, then it goes back to where everything is fine and then something else happens. It's referenced so much in the community that the phrase ""Higurashi face"" - the extreme exaggeration of an expression and personality, has become a thing. The characters are all memorable and all the twists this show throws at you can really mess with your head. Although the animation is sub par at best, it is still very much worth a watch, just not in the dark alone... that is crazy.

School Days: Now just bear with me ok. ""Why would you ever say this is a *must see anime* are you insane?"" While I see what you're saying let me elaborate. This show is one of the most if not THE most infamous show in the anime community. Now if you are going to understand the countless references to it, I say give it a watch with an open mind. Personally I went into it knowing all the hate on it, and i enjoyed the fuck out of it. All the stupidity everyone said, was COMPLETELY RIGHT, so much so that it was funny to me. I laughed so hard it almost killed me. But some people are into shows like this and think it is genius. While i give that it is somewhat original in it's plot, i would argue it goes about it all wrong and could have been better. And that ending though? It's iconic. You can't even really dispute that. It's just a thing. So if you are an anime fan you know what this is and you should see for yourself why everyone talks about it.

Now for shows I haven't seen but I know I have to soon:

Cowboy Bebop: Now I haven't seen this show so i can't talk THAT much about it, but just from sheer impact this show has had on the anime community I know about it enough to give a summary. This show takes place in the future and there are space bounty hunters running around in intense action scenes.  It's old but gold. I would say along with most, a classic.

Damn now this spot was hard to choose so i'm going to have an honorable mentions under this but last but not least:

Neon Genesis Evangalion: THE Mecha show. Now I haven't seen this show either but from what i've heard it's story is so amazing that it has a cult following. I know that code geass is like the new age mecha show that everyone goes crazy over but Evangalion just had to take this spot. 

I tried to include the most important in every genre that I could think of but let me throw some honorable mentions out there:

Death Note. Damn I was going to put this show but I already had 2 psychological thrillers up there and the ending was kinda like... meh. So i chose Evangalion over this even though I have seen Death Note and how good it was to start off.

Attack on Titan & Sword Art Online: I put these 2 together just because I think that they are riding off the hype of the times right now and they need to be out longer to be properly labeled as a ""must see"". Now you say 'Oh but Steins;Gate is up there and it's new'. Yea but that show is different. Attack on Titan is good but I don't this it's a classic as it is unfinished as of now and I don't know where the second season is going to take it. And SAO I haven't seen but even SAO fans say that the second half of the first season is like completely pointless so... yea.

Gurren Laggan: Now this show was good, but i think it was just good. I mean it's extremely popular but it feels very... For lack of a better explanation, it takes the ""Kid show"" approach to most problems. 
Main character gives inspirational speech>sudden burst of power nobody knew about>win. And it does have a lot of a good moments that I know about that are great, but that's just my opinion.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Not much I can say, it's probably one of the best shows out there but I don't think it's enough to say it's a ""must see"" mostly because i'm really salty about the endless 8.

FMA:Brotherhood: Now This probably would be up there and replace something but I haven't seen it and im purposely avoiding spoilers to this show because im watching it soon. And it seems very easy to avoid spoilers because nobody really talks about it... It just is #1 on MAL and I barely hear about it. I hear about Angel Beats! more and that show I didn't think was that revolutionary.

Hope this helps!"
24096,">I'm doing this based on how much i feel like anime have effected the community not necessarily how good they are

I like your definition of ""must watch"". [It's very similar to how I define it,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2hvjtr/your_top_6_must_watch_animes/ckwgrl4) as opposed to these lists of people's favorite anime that seem to make up most of the comments in this thread. 

>Neon Genesis Evangalion: THE Mecha show. Now I haven't seen this show either but from what i've heard it's story is so amazing that it has a cult following.

Check out my quick little entry about Evangelion in the comment I linked. Do not watch Eva because you want to see badass mecha fights. Because, while the mecha fights are quite good, they are definitely not the focus of the show so you'll most likely be disappointed. It is a *heavy* and draining watch once you get into the second part of the show because the various psychological problems afflicting the main characters begin to manifest more obviously and torment them. 

>FMA:Brotherhood

> It just is #1 on MAL and I barely hear about it.

Brotherhood is definitely an excellent anime, and it's No. 1 status on MAL is largely due to it's unequaled universal appeal. Many people absolutely love it, and even those that don't at least like it. This agreement spawns very little debate and discussion, which is part of the reason why you never see it mentioned. The other part of the reason it's never discussed is because what you see is what you get. There isn't much to interpret in this anime. The motivations of all the characters are fairly apparent and it's pretty easy for every viewer to grasp everything that's occurring in the story. Many anime discussions are spawned by someone asking ""I don't understand why character A did this in Anime A""? or ""Why did Event B occur in Anime B""? Nobody asks these questions about it because everyone that watches FMA:B understands these things. On the other end of the spectrum is Evangelion, who's entire plot goes largely unexplained during the series, with fans writing theses on it's story based on tiny little bits of information gleamed after multiple rewatches of the anime. The difference between these two isn't that Evangelion is ""intelligent"" and Brotherhood is ""dumb"", it's that these 2 anime have completely different goals in mind. FMA:Brotherhood wants to create a compelling story full of exciting characters that will engage and entertain the viewer. Evangelion wants to examine the psychological implications of the mecha trope of young teens bearing the burden of protecting the world from a great threat by piloting super-advanced mecha. People don't understand the story because they're not supposed to...because it's not important for accomplishing the creator's intent. They are both very different and both great anime because both are able to accomplish their very different goals in spectacular fashion.

Sorry I wrote so much but I got on a roll there. Hopefully you were able to gain something from reading it. Happy watching! Well, at least if you're watching FMA: Brotherhood. Not so happy watching if you decide to check out Evangelion ;)"
24097,"you are probably right about FMA, I just said that because like i said I haven't seen it yet so I haven't experienced what you said, but I haven't experienced much. That's why it's just a mention. What you said is really cool though."
24098,"* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* AnoHana
* Gurren Lagann
* Read or Die OVA!
* Baccano!
* Guilty Crown"
24099,"This is a great question! I'm currently in a parallel situation to yours, where I'm trying to get my fiancee into anime, or at least share with her shows that are good enough that she'll enjoy despite them being anime. So I'll suggest:

* Madoka Magica - this has been mentioned a lot of times on here. I think the story is good enough to stand on its own even if you haven't seen a lot of anime, but if you HAVE seen any magical girl shows, it is really going to blow your mind. If you're at all familiar with Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, that kind of thing, it adds a whole new layer of whatthefuckery to this one.

* Death Note - based on the anime that you've listed I think this is one you should definitely check out. Two brilliant minds - one a budding sociopath with supernatural killing powers, one a brilliant detective - clash through a series of escalating twists and turns. As others have said, it falters considerably in its last arc, but getting there is a great ride.

* Trigun - This is a bit like a seinen version of a lot of things you like. It's showing its age, but it's genuinely funny in an old-anime kind of way, and has a lot of thematic similarities to Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm actually surprised this connection doesn't get drawn more often. Even beyond the superficial similarities (wandering heroes encounter specific trials in various places, MC has blonde hair, a big red coat and artificial limbs, etc), the two series deal with some of the same ideas - loss, loyalty, what must be sacrificed for power. You could also describe Trigun as ""silly space desert Batman,"" so if that sounds interesting, you might like it.

* Berserk - This is the anime that got me into anime. Fantastic action sequences, great characters and fantastic (if old-school) animation. Be warned - this anime can be extremely upsetting, especially toward the end, but it's a great story of honor and brotherhood.

* Cowboy Bebop - This is generally regarded as the best anime of all time, and for good reason. This is the one to show people that don't like anime. If my fiancee didn't irrationally hate everything set in space, I would have shown this to her first. It's got incredible writing, characters, cinematography, animation, music, everything. The Dub is FANTASTIC; I actually cannot watch this show in Japanese.

* Akira - It's a movie, and again, pretty dark, but this is THE work that defined modern anime and basically the West's relationship with anime ever since. Amazing animation and soundtrack. The story is pretty divisive - there is a lot of technobabble that doesn't get explained and the background is intentionally kept pretty sketchy, but the whole story's a metaphor anyway so it doesn't really matter.

Honorable mentions - I would call these ""must-watches"" if you're looking to get more into anime, but maybe these aren't ones I'd jump right into when trying to introduce someone to the genre:

* Neon Genesis Evangelion - it IS that good, and it IS that important. Turned everything that mecha anime (all the Macross, all the Gundam) on its head and paved the way for a lot more thoughtful anime to follow.

* FLCL - watch it AFTER you've seen shows like Evangelion - you'll appreciate it a lot more. Also goes well with Gurrenn Lagann, which I can't recommend only because I haven't seen it yet! It's next on my list.

* Ghost in the Shell: SAC - maybe the smartest anime I've ever seen.

EDIT: I forgot how dark FMA gets, revising some of my wording."
24100,"Cowboy Bebop is a really good example of a lot of things. Classic anime, great dubs, and great character development, especially considering its mainly episodic. 

K-On is the quintessential moe slice of life show. You may not like those things, but regardless, if you wanna see the sub-genre at its finest, look no further.

From The New World has great world building, and an interesting plot. It's a show where you have to pay a fair amount of attention or you'll be like ""what"" when you snap back into it. Fairly serious themes too.

Madoka Magica is a show that you should watch. I won't say why, but give it at least three episodes, and ideally ten. 

Usagi Drop is the number one show for making you feel better about everything. Life, yourself, the world, anything. This show never fails to put me in a better place.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has it all. It has action, it has good art and animation, it has exemplary characters, it has great music, it has the feels, it has the ""Fuck yeah!"" moments, it has the messages and morals, and it has a great story. Its dub is top-notch, it's well written and faithful to the source material. It appeals to a lot of audiences. It appeals to the crybaby in me that likes to feel, it appeals to the big brother in me, it appeals to the part of me that loves my parents. It covers so many things and reaches so many audiences. You can dislike this show, you can hate it, but you cannot tell me that it doesn't have a LOT going for it. It's not even my favourite show, but I definitely think of it as near perfect."
24101,"You. I like you. I have seen only half of these, but you've convinced me to give K-On a shot (I don't like moe! but this show gets mentioned SO OFTEN and you know what I do like? Good character development). You say FMA:B isn't your favourite anime - what is?"
24102,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is my #1, Anohana 2, K-On 3, then FMA B 4.

Also, give it a fair chance. I started off being like ""what is this shit"" but by the end of season 2 I was crying my eyes out."

I usually prefer animes with ""good"" endings. So Evangelion would not be on my list as well as most Urobutcher's work.   

Some of the animes I picked influenced Japanese culture so much that you can say ""neta"" (meme) to most people and they'd get it even they are not into animes at all. Like Yum Cha being super weak in Dragon Balls or Ken telling someone ""you are ready dead."" Or ""legs are for decorations only..."" or ""rocket boobs""...  but that's another topic.   

I didn't include **Steins;Gate** because I prefer the light novel more than the anime.   

I also like the novels of Welcome to NHK better than anime.   

Mirai Nikki is a tough one - the manga is better but it's also more confusing. Personally I prefer the manga but the anime isn't bad.  

Kore wa Zombie desu ka is great... for the light novel. The anime is alright. Same for High School DxD...    

Outbreak Company is just out and the verdict will have to wait. I always like Ichiro Sasaki's LN/script though. Same for No Game No Life, but so far so good.    

Akira has an awesome manga, if the animed movie got you hooked, you shouldn't miss it.   

While I like Code Geass and Lain, I don't think they are for everyone.  

In the Honorary Mentions I also *try not to repeat other people's suggestion*. Except for **Mushishi** and Angel Beats, I voted again because they are definitely worth a watch."
24108,You... You are my friend now... Period.
24109,What would you say is good about Legend of Galactic Heroes. I'm just about to start the first of 110 episodes of it and I would like some justification to ease my nerves. (long series commitment issues)
24110,"It's the best Anime out there, everything's great about it except the art.
Great battles, fantastic characters, an intelligent plot/backstory and themes no anime has ever tackled again on this level."
24111,Thanks! It sounds pretty unique.
24112,"It's long and slow, and about a range of topics from politics to love to personal sins to life. One of my favorite movies (non-anime) is Dinner with Andre - it talks about the two possible stance on facing ""Life"" - that if the meaning of life is life itself, what do we make of it? Anyway, that movie is long and mostly just two guys talking. And most people hate it or ""don't get it."" For me, I adore it because if you allow yourself to imagine their words, chew and taste them, and reflect on them, the movie is brilliant. Of course, you try to show it to people who have never experience doubt towards their lives, they'd not understand it. Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain tries to answer the same question with a different answer, in a much more graphical way that most people are forced to open their eyes or they don't. Dinner with Andre is much more gentle and forgiving. It talks to you, but whether you listen or not is up to you.  

For LoGH, it's an epic that unfolds very slowly. If you are not enjoying them, come back later... 5-10 years later. I, too, tried to watch the series when I was a kid. And boy, I thought it was the most boring trash I've ever watched! I couldn't understand *why* it was recommended by so many people.  

Now that I've grown and experienced this world so much more, that I have failed, succeeded, loved, hated, betrayed and been betrayed, and see the reality of the world... the series speak to me. If you find yourself question the state of this world and your place in it chaos, you may want to watch LoGH again. Enjoy!"
24113,I watched the first episode last night and I definitely got the feeling of scale from it. The art style is respectable despite its age (although definitely shows it.) So far the plot seems intelligent and grand. Looking forward to watching more of it.

24152,"From a range of different categories. 

[Stein's Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) - Easily one of the best.  It starts a little slow, but when it hits full steam it doesn't stop.  

[Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni) - This anime IMO falls more under the mystery and suspense umbrella.  What sets this one apart is the story telling which leaves you asking questions and constantly throwing wrenches in your theory.  By in far it was one of my all time favorites because the story telling is so masterful. (Can't tell you how though! That will spoil the first 5 episodes!)

This anime does have a few scenes that can get really intense gore wise; however, I would say it's really only about 4-5 scenes in the first season and by the second season there aren't any scenes like that. So it is not a 24/7 gore fest.  But even with these scenes there are also many very light hearted sections which control the pacing of the story. 

*I would say this is a must watch!*

[Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood) - One of the easiest animes to get into for newer viewers.  I've rarely found anyone who didn't like the series.  It's very well done and appeals to a large audience. 

[Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) - This one you sorta have to wade through the average first season to get to, but the climax of this series is the one that people remember.  Definitely more on the emotional side, but it does leave an impact. 

[Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) - One of the better slice of life/comedy anime IMO.  It's sorta a non-sequitur style, but still likable and easy for many to watch"

24156,"Full metal alchemist both original and brotherhood watch both

Mushi-shi:a relaxing series that has the first season on Netflix and the second and the interseries episode is on crunchyroll and ongoing

Magi though I have to say that it starts out not super well so some people don't keep watching but if you do it is worth it 

Space Dandy just because it is still on and just really really random

Kotoura-san is a short series but really really good.

None of this is in a order they are all really good"

24159,"Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  Another.  DeathNote. AOT.  FullMetal Alchemist.   

Not in that order per say, but PMMM definitely in front. :3

-note- am currently watching/started Naruto, find it quite compelling, and am sorta immersed, i know its old, seems like a classic though... Had i finished it, i feel it could be mention able here."
24160,"Not in order:

Shinsekai Yori - Read the mal entry.

Steins;Gate - Starts weak, ends strong. One of the best anime ever made as said by others.

Chihayafuru - You don't have any reason to skip this anime even if you don't like SoL/Romance.

Kingdom - The anime is so-so, but still a must see for me. Also, i think this is like one of the best shounen manga ever made, i'd choose Kingdom over Naruto and Fairy Tail any day. Of course, imo HxH still tops shounen category. One Piece is still strong, FMA was too good, Rurouni Kenshin was damn good too, Yu Yu Hakushu was good and Slam Dunk follows Hajimme no Ippo in sports/shounen as top 1 and top  2.

Hunter x Hunter - You have no reason to skip Hunter x Hunter, both 1999 and 2011 series are crafted beautifully, the manga is damn good too. In my case, since Hunter x Hunter is my first manga and anime, HxH has a special place in my heart.

Eureka 7 - If you didn't liked Eureka 7 then i don't like you, Eureka 7 is a must see for me i'd hate you if you don't even wanna try to watch this. IDK why but when i was watching this anime, E7 felt special and different. Same with Hunter x Hunter, this anime will have a special place in my heart.

Honorable mentions: Kara no Kyoukai, FMA:B, Bakuman, Monogatari Series."
