30670,"Denmark or the Netherlands. Small, rich and happy countries with working democracies and great neighbours."
30671,"Living in Denmark and visited the Netherlands not long ago; inner-city Copenhagen and Amsterdam are remarkably similar.

A good pick, if you don't mind the pretty unremarkable weather."
30672,"I'm German, so the weather should be pretty much the same, at least like our north. And I love that. :)"
30673,"I see the significance of ""great neighbours"" now. ;)"
30674,"Fun thing is I was thinking of Sweden, Belgium, France and the sea. ;)

I don't even like Germany too much because it's filled with Germans."
30675,Bad neighbor.
30676,I was in Copenhagen in 1980. I remember the city smelling of pÃ¸lse and diesel. Does it still?
30677,Parts of it definitely still do. Other parts have gotten a lot better since the 80's. :)
30678,"Oh, I don't remember it as a negative, just distinctive. Similarly, I've heard that Seoul smells like kimchi."
30679,Belgium is similar.
30680,"oh hell yeah!! Copenhagen and Amsterdam are the most welcoming and wonderful cities in the world, and the people there are incredible. I hope to study, work and/or live in either country some day.

Or both.

Life goal right there."

30711,Very true
30712,"But because of your big geographical area and low density, your infrastructure is not very efficient. So I wouldn't agree on the geographic lottery. Your roads are heavily subsidised to keep competitive, and the budget can't last. A good example of the consequences of the big geographical area would be your phone prices. In europe you can get a plan like: All europe plan: 10 hours calling, unlimited text, 10 gbit data for 15 dollars. It's just to show that a lot of infrastructure logistics are much cheaper in areas that are more dense."

30717,"Well, like I said it's all about preference and where you feel happy.

Australia is home to me, and always will be, and Norway is home to you. Fair enough, I respect that. And Australian women aren't half bad either haha."

30721,"America.  I'm not trying to be all ""Murica!!!"", but it really is.  It's literally the center of modern civilization.  Other countries have better human rights, better laws, but when it comes down to it, everything gets compared to American standards, that's not without a reason."
30722,">everything gets compared to American standards, that's not without a reason.

Maybe it does in America. 

>I'm not trying to be all ""Murica!!!""

but you're succeeding effortlessly"
30723,"lol the reason why everything is compared to the US is because of its strong economy and influence on the world. That doesn't mean its citizens are happier and its a better place to live. For christ sakes, you people voted in Donald Trump."
30724,"You just contradicted yourself. Do you honestly think that most people's lives are DIRECTLY related to who the president is. I mean taxes may change, and worse case scenario a war could start, but the presidents aren't exactly responsible for how happy people's lives are. Most people's lives in America are not going to change because Trump was elected."
30725,"Canada and the US rank 9 and 10 on the HDI. That's a pretty good indicator of living standards in a country. We are not #1. Close, but not the best."
30726,"I certainly don't think you're wrong but I think that these rankings shouldn't be only thing people consider. For example taking into account average life expectancy, education, you are taking averages which can be skewed by outliers. Take example in America, more people are obese which largely contributes to life expectancy. But statistics are just that, generalizations. It doesn't dictate your own life. If you want to be healthy, you can be healthy. Education is the same. American k-12 schools are not as highly ranked as other countries, but it certainly doesn't mean that students are incapable of doing very well academically, and can't excel in American Colleges which are generally very high ranking. I'm not trying to say these global rankings and standards like public schooling, violence, standard of living, etc are wrong or insignificant, but they aren't like rigid truths. America is an extremely diverse country that is just huge, which makes it a harder to manage and budget properly than a place like Japan which is ranked very highly in a lot of these standards. This isn't an excuse for slack, but more so and indicator of outliers that drastically skew the rankings and data of things like education quality and income inequality. Take example the average salary in America. Around 30-50k. By no means is that a ceiling you are limited to. Just a few examples.

TLDR: Statistics don't tell the whole story, just part of it."
30727,"Okay, but these things indicate that things are on average better for more people in the higher rated countries."
30728,"No we didn't, we voted in Hilary Clinton (over 3 million more people voted for Hillary than Trump)

the electoral college elected donald trump"
30729,"Still, a decent portion of people had to cast their vote for trump. And 3 million isnt a massive anount cobsidering that yiu have like 330 million in youre country."
30730,"The US is so big that I'll never have to interact with/live around ppl who voted for trump in large numbers. Our big cities are just as liberal as any major western city (San Francisco, Seattle, LA, Chicago, NYC, Boston, Miami, DC, ect.). This on top of the fact that most of the most livable/most admired states (Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Mass., Hawaii, Colorado, ect.) did not go for Trump."
30731,"Yeah and what about people that want to live in a small town? They will he surrounded by morons. Also, regardless of where you live in that country, hes still your president. You still have him forming your countries policies and taking the rights of people away. The us is not the best country in the world."
30732,"There are plenty of very liberal small towns in the US, in just about every state. Stay away from the bible belt and you're fine. What rights is he taking away? My life has literally not changed in the slightest since he became president. Also, who the fuck said it was the best country in the world?"
30733,Lol the title of the post is asking what the best country in the world is.
30734,"It says best country in the world to live in. In my opinion the USA and Canada are easily the best countries to live in, but that doesn't mean I think they are the best countries on earth. I personally believe that title belongs to the UK."
30735,Please forgive him........ he is American.
30736,"It's about 3% of the number of people who actually voted, and while not a landslide, that's like saying the population of Chicago has no influence"
30737,"Yes but overall there was sizable portion of people who were gullible enough to fall for his shit. Plus, even if nobody voted for him, he is still the president of your countey so that right there is enough for me to make the judgement that thr US is not the best place to live."
30738,"Only Americans compare everything to ""American standards""."
30739,"Wrong. The world economy is essentially based around the dollar because it is the strongest. The biggest markets for most things are prominently in America. High standards on many top professions that other parts of the world emulate, etc. Granted some professions have surpassed Americans but you are ignorant if you honestly believe America has no standards that are influential."
30740,except your use of lbs as a weight of measurement instead of kilograms... and using Fahrenheit vs Celsius... and miles vs kilometres. They don't make sense lmao
30741,It does to Americans

30743,"2204.62 lbs in a tonne.

1000 kgs in a tonne.

How does that makes sense?"
30744,"In the US, a ton is 2,000 lbs.  You are using a metric tonne.  We even have an expression where we say ""metric ton"" as an exaggeration because it is more than a standard US ton."
30745,We don't argue we just go with it
30746,"Yeah, but we're so big population wise and we all do it so it's never a problem. I'll go my entire life not caring that the rest of the world is different and it won't cause me a single problem."

There are a lot of things to do here, and it's a great place to experience other cultures and customs without having to leave the country. It has its issues but I'd venture to say there is a pretty good reason why so many people came here and still continue to from all over the world."

Also danish is a beautiful, bendy language that you can manouver in so many ways it's amazing. If you want to read truly beautiful danish litterature I recommend H.C. Andersen.

30826,"Honestly can't really fault it.  I've thought about leaving Ireland but there's nothing hugely wrong.  Taxes are high,  but not Norway high,  weather could be better but having spent the year in Colorado and dealing with snow all winter I've grown to appreciate it here because even thought it gets to colder you can still do whatever you like outdoor wise (within reason). 
It's got its small problems but all countries do

If you have an questions I'd be happy to answer"
30828,"Another Irish here.

Firstly, I'd say that Ireland is basically a centre-right country. I'd wager that about 80% of the people I've talked to (mostly teenagers) are for marriage equality. However, my father's generation (~40) would be more like 55-60% in favour. In any case, I expect that Ireland will only become more liberal in the next few decades, as my generation matures.

Speaking Irish is utterly optional. In fact, the majority of Irish people could only speak a few sentences (myself included, though I've become a lot better in the last year or so) . Unless you go to the Gaeltacht areas, where Irish is the primary language, you won't have any trouble, and even then they're hardly going to throw you out for not talking ""as Gaeilge"".

Regarding college choice, I'm afraid I can't give you anything more than conjecture, so take what I say with a pinch of salt. But, as far as I know, UCD is a more STEM focused college than Trinity, which is more well known for its arts and humanities (particularly the English department). Therefore I suggest you go to UCD for a CS course (not to be confused with the college on the other side of Dublin, DCU.)

I hope that what I've said helps you in making a decision!"
30829,New Zealand seems like a nice place.

- Auckland weather and traffic (easily fixed by not living in Auckland)

- Average pay and cost of living."

job market is in the toilet, homeless are everywhere."
30837,"There are some things that make NZ a fantastic place to live, or at the very least seem like big selling points e.g:

* Nothing here can kill you - We have no snakes, our spiders can't kill you and most of our native species are birds or bugs.  Even our police are safer because they don't carry guns for normal duty so people are rarely killed by police.
* Public healthcare is actually a really good thing - If you live here and you need hospital level care then you won't pay so there are no big medical debts.
* ACC - if you get injured here, whether you live here or not, you qualify for compensation which covers the cost of treatment, most of the cost of physio, etc.  If you're working here legally and meet a few other criteria then you also get 80% of your pay for work you have to miss.

Things you don't realise until you're living here:

* We are a small market so we get less range of everything and pay more for it.
* Petrol costs more, about 4 times what Americans pay.
* You can't even travel within NZ without taking a flight unless you're staying within one island or you live in Wellington.
* International travel is expensive, especially at times when a lot of people are travelling.  A lot of airlines that fly here have agreements with other airlines as well so you could be on a flight with people who booked through 3 different airlines.
* The only time NZ is mentioned on TV or in movies is as the butt of a joke.

30849,"Why is it boring? I spent 3 weeks there. Only went to Amsterdam for an afternoon to visit the Rijksmuseum, but absolutely loved the country. I'm starting the immigration process at the end of the summer and couldn't be more excited. I'm not one for nightlife, partying, that sort of thing. I have a degree in history. And everywhere I went I was absolutely fascinated. I loved just walking through the streets of Utrecht."
30850,"Heh. Bunch of people that like to think they are very tolerant, but are basically racist. The government is slowly destroying the healthcare and education systems, but no one seems to care. And if you don't fit the body shape of the Dutch (tall and broad, both men and women) you cannot shop for affordable clothes anywhere."
30851,"I live there, yes racism/immigration exists. But the greatest of all pains: the language. Even tough we speak english on an okay-level, the Dutch language is extremely hard. Also, prepare for rain."
30852,"> the Dutch language is extremely hard

Though if you know other Germanic languages, it's not really all that difficult to pick up. I can understand a relatively big portion of Dutch texts based on just my knowledge of Swedish, German and English. 

It's the pronunciation that's tricky. Fucking g sounds, man. And sometimes R's are rolled, sometimes not, depending on what part of the country you're from. Personally I like Flemish the most."
30853,">Personally I like Flemish the most

Back to Sweden with you"
31459,North Korea
30856,"Exactly! People relocate to other countries all the time- but have you ever heard of a North Korean moving? No! The government also does really awesome things. Say for example, your father committed a terrible crime like saying something negative about the Leader in passing to a friend. He would be put to death. While you'd be mortified about the crime he committed, you'd also really miss him. The government will not only kill him, but kill generations of your family as well! That way you will never have to be embarrassed about his crimes, or go through the pain of missing dad! They're always thinking of their citizens!"
30857,Scotland/UK.
30858,Cannae understand a Scot.
30859,I'm from Edinburgh. Other Scots mistake us for the English.
30860,"That's because you sound like the English.
Glasgow FTW"
30861,"I think a strong but well-spoken Paisley accent is the best one in the country. It makes me blush. 

P.S. Glasgow is definitely superior in shopping possibilities. I wish I was less agoraphobic, I haven't been in years."
30862,Paisley is just Glasgow's jakey wee cousin.
30864,No-one ever wants to move to Poland.
30865,You should be happy now that the Russians and Germans aren't invading anymore.
30866,">You should be happy now that the Russians and Germans aren't invading ~~anymore~~ at the moment.

FTFY"
30867,"Poland is beautiful. Period.

Source: am Polish"
30869,"Been to Warsaw in summer. Can confirm. 

Also, Polish girls."
30870,">Polish girls

Yeah, they really shine."
30871,Singapore.
30872,"Singaporean here.


Good:
safe - never have fear for your safety or property ever.
small - everything is near to each other because its just a city.
infrastructure - everything everywhere is nice. nice roads, nice buildings, nice internet.


Bad:
Expensive - most expensive city in the world. Price of motor vehicles and housing, especially.
Culture - the average Singaporean has a unique.. culture. But I guess this takes some getting used to just like every other country.


Would I recommend?

If you're wealthy, you will have fun here. Money talks, and Singapore is a good listener."
30873,"> Money talks, and Singapore is a good listener.

I feel like this would make an excellent slogan for a Singaporean tourist agency"
30874,"Singapore is a great country to live in - but the consistency may end up boring you.

No-one talks about the weather - because it is the same every day.  Tomorrow will be 31 or 32C and you will probably get a thunderstorm late afternoon.

The difference between the longest day (mid-Summer) and the shortest day (mid-Winter) is only 8 minutes - so the sun always comes up about 7am and goes down about 7pm.

Some things are horribly expensive - real estate, cars, petrol, some food, booze.

Some things are ridiculously cheap - Some food, Taxis, MRT (Subway trains), Internet (and it is fast), cable TV, massages..."
30875,I wanna live in the UK. I Also don't care about the rain.
30876,"As an Englishman, I'd say that rain isn't the issue. 

It's the amount of days spent in complete grey skies with a pseudo-cold temperature. It's not a rainstorm. It's soul-suckingly dreary. Rain would at least make it ""weather"" of some kind"
30877,I'd rather that than it being unbelievably humid all the time.
30878,"I'm planning to go to Australia in 2018, so I'll see how that goes."
30879,"If you make it back alive, I'll give you gold."
30880,"Comment saved. I hope you were serious, and I hope you are still a redditor in 2020"
30881,I am dead serious.
30882,"RemindMe! 5 years ""guy promises gold in 2020 to another guy"""
30883,Wow. You've got 2018 planned and I don't even know what I'm doing later on today!
30884,"I might take another poop this afternoon, I'm still undecided"
30885,We specialise in moaning about our country. Get ready
30886,I like moaning.
30887,/r/britishproblems
30888,"I moved from Canada to the UK years ago and will probably never go back. Life here can be hard sometimes but I think it's worth it. I love the fact that I can get on a train and in 20 min be somewhere with a different accent. I love the pub culture. I love the museums/art galleries. And I love the sense of humor! It's also amazing that you can fly allover Europe for cheap. When I was in Canada a trip to Greece was considered a once in a lifetime experience... now I can go there without a second thought for the cost of a weeks wage! 

The weather is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Yes it rains. And sometimes, when it starts, it won't stop for days! But the beautiful frosty December mornings and long summer evenings make up for it! And remember, all that rain makes for some lush, green countryside.

But there are some right shit-hole towns."
30889,"Nothing gets done in the uk, or at least where i live.

Want a drivers license? 8 week waiting list, want a dentists appointment? 4 week waiting list, want planning permission for an extension? Apply before your 30 or you won't live long enough to get it approved."
30890,Well I am a nothing gets done kind of guy.
30891,"Where do you live that you get such long waiting lists?? Im in Hull at the moment, supposedly a shit hole and I got a dentist appointment as soon as I wanted one, GP normally 2 days etc"
30892,">Im in Hull at the moment

I am so, so sorry. Please, if there's anything we can do."
30893,Its okay. The areas I am im are much nicer than most cities ive been to in the UK. :)
30894,"Live up north: Miserable weather, and post-industrial poverty

Live down south: Also miserable, and rude people"
30895,"Been maintaining something of a fantasy about moving to Canada over the last few years. The Internet situation is somehow worse than in the UK, I know that much"
30896,"I can't speak for the rest of Canada but as an American who had lived in Quebec for 5 years I have some warnings. While Montreal is a woderful city and has many English speakers, Quebec really is like a French speaking country within Canada. They also have a few laws that discriminate against English speakers. For instance, if you are an immigrant then your kids automatically have to go to French school and all of their homework and  school documents are in French. It becomes difficult to help your children with homework or read the school newsletter. You've been warned."
30897,">  Quebec really is like a French speaking country within Canada

Well, French is the only official language of the province, and the huge majority of the population speaks French as their first language..."
30898,All the parts of Canada are too far away from each other.
30899,"Aside from places like Vancouver, it is around or below freezing for five to six months of the year, and as such not very nice to be outside. But, at least in my experience in Toronto, the summers are awesome and filled with amazing stuff to do because enjoying the outdoors is so precious."
30900,"I'd like to live in America, specifically New York. I know it's expensive, blah blah blah, but whenever I've been it felt like the very center of culture, the eye of the tornado, the heart of the matter."
30901,"New York City is great if you make in excess of $80,000 annually (preferably more). 

If not, you're either living in a 400 sq ft, 6-story walk-up that was built in the 1940s (with 2 roommates), or you're living in Deep Bushwick with hipsters.

Either way you're subsiding on rice, beans and halal food because roughly 45% of your monthly income is going to rent. 

On the plus side: Halal Food is delicious. 

Edit: For those that inboxed me, the Chicken and Rice carts in NYC are colloquially known as ""Halal Food"" or ""Halal."" I'm aware of what Halal actually means and that the term itself refers to a certain process when slaughtering the animal."
30902,"Can confirm.. I make $120k a year and I live in a 500sq ft 5 story walkup, and have very little disposable income after rent and living expenses."
30903,"Hearing how little money can buy you in New York, makes me happy that i live in Texas where i have a two floor 2500 sqft house and making 80k a year."
30904,"New York is a huge state, and NYC is only one teeny-tiny part of it. If you were to live an hour or two north of the city, you'd be able to visit it anytime you'd like, and everything's much cheaper and there are a lot of very beautiful places to choose from."
30905,Driving two hours would put me on the other side of the country. Two hours is like a really really long time to drive here in the Netherlands
30906,"An Englishman thinks 100 miles is a long way, and an American thinks 100 years is a long time."
30907,"Sweden, Norway or Texas"
30908,One of these things are not like the others
30909,Norway the only one without an immigration issue.
30910,"Yeah, Sweden doesn't have as much oil as the other two"
30912,"I'm a fan of Texas. Just try to avoid talking politics with anyone... You never know when otherwise very friendly people will turn out to be insane.

 Also, Austin is pretty crowded these days. Houston's got some good stuff going for it, but is more humid than the devil's ass crack. San Antonio doesn't feel like a city so much as a collection of suburbs and strip malls with a tourist trap in the center. Dallas is a bit...uh... old money? And El Paso is half way to California.

Or you could live somewhere smaller. But that would be risky."
30913,"I'd rather like to live in Australia. I used to want to live in Russia, but I'm bi, so I'd be fucked up shit creek if I lived there."
30914,I moved to Australia four years ago. There isn't much to complain about. Its far away from everything so travelling overseas is expensive.
30915,"Also, unless you have rich parents you're never going to afford a house anywhere remotely decent."
30916,"Australia is a wonderful place with a shitty misogynistic, racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic tool of a prime minister and a serious obesity problem."
30917,"We also have a really horrible case of tall poppy syndrome and poorly handled foreign relationships.

Oh, tall poppy syndrome means cutting people down to size whenever they seem to be getting ahead."
30918,"Everytime I hear about your PM Abbott on TV I feel like I wanna punch the screen. Seriously, vote for anyone but him."
30919,the reason he got voted into power if become of how blind and desperate Australia was to get out of the previous government
30920,"Do you like bush fires? If not, just wait for it to pass and a flood will be not far away."
30921,"Now listen here cunt, I am a fair dinkum aussie and this place is so fucked its a joke. For starters, the sheilas are fucking filthy mate. Not a single on has any fucking decency and if you find one that does, they're either foreign or have autism. 

Our uni's are fucking ripper and we dont pay a cent for them until we're thirty and well paid, but bloody good fucking luck getting to one because the housing around them will tear you a new asshole because the landlords all think we're foreign and literally shit cash.

Let's say you dont want to live in the city, like I used to - well you better fucking be immune to all snake bites, be 6' 4"" to fight off a big red, and know exactly where to poke a fucking drop bear when they descend from trees. There are also more spiders here than that filthy nest in the second harry potter.

Finally mate, if you can't smash at least 24 VB tinnies dont even bother. First because no one respects fucking light weights, and second because piss is so bloody expensive you need to take out a mortgage at our just as expensive banks to buy it in smaller quantities than a slab.

If you move here and make it to sundy, let me know how you did it cunt."
30923,"As an Aussie who's spent a lot of time in the US, this makes me giggle as I know that an American would probably only understand one in five words of what you just said"
30924,"While true for the average Joe, many of us have had our English-dialect horizons broadened, ya cheeky cunt"
30925,An average house here costs over a million dollars. The rent on my 3 bedroom place in an average suburb is $650 per week.
30926,Barbados
30928,I hate murder season.
30930,The only problem with France is that we're too close to the British. :p
30931,"Brit living in France here. Things are different here, but not necessarily any better than in the UK. Over time I've just swapped complaining about Britain to complaining about France. 

Frustrating complacency/stubbornness - nothing ever changes even when the system's totally broken, awful bureaucracy, everything is political, really high taxes increasing despite cuts in social services, TV is terrible, shops are shut on Sundays...

I'm in the North so the weather's still shit, but the South has it's downsides too (people are much more closed, for example; I could never make meaningful friendships with locals down there.) 

Edit: Also I disagree about leisure time. Having a longer lunch hour means finishing work later so less time for hobbies or socialising. Also sports and other clubs are always chronically underfunded and stop running during the summer."
30932,"Southern Mexico. I lived there before, I speak Spanish, and I have my own toilet paper."
30934,"Somalia is actually pretty awesome, nothing shit about it."
30935,Y'aaarrghh!
30936,Wait but are you lying though
30937,"Somalia has 1,900 miles of coastline, a government that knows its place, and all the guns and wives you can afford to buy."
30938,"Somalia's not that bad. The locals are friendly, the food is nice. If your into beaches Somalia's coastline stretches out for miles and the view is  stunning. Sure there is the ever impending threat of Al-Shabaab who wouldn't hesitate to slit your throat infront of the camera of a shitty Nokia Lumia phone while chanting death to America and host the video on a third party website for all your friends and family to see

But of course there is little chance of that occurring and the food is *really* nice"
30939,"Have fun returning without your pants or anything else, and maybe die. Oh and PIRATES YAAAAAR"
30940,"but if youre well armed and a good shot, and people like to follow you, youve got a shot at running large parts of Somalia!! easy peasy!!"
31168,Canada!
30942,Canadian government just voted in bill C-51. More or less the Patriot act of Canada.
30943,"Didn't they play the ""if you don't like it, you're probably a terrorist"" card too? 
And wasn't the majority of the reaction to the bill negative?"
30944,"every political intellectual, retired judge, anyone with half a brain was apposed. heck our whole country was opposed to this blatantly obvious patriot act. We made it so clear that we the people didn't want anything to do with c-51 yet stephen harper decided to put on that dumb little smirk he always has give us all the finger and pass what is clearly the worst decision made since the conservatives gained a majority government."
30945,all hail prime minster Stephen W Harbush!
30946,what is the bill about?
30947,[It's a British police procedural drama set in East London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bill)
30948,I cant wait for federal elections. Maybe they will take after Alberta.
30949,"Have been in and out of Canada for 2 years.  Honestly, every time I'm I hear ""the Canadian Government..."" I physically tense up.  It's like being away on vacation and knowing that your teenage kids are trashing your house.  Seriously the biggest stress when I'm back there, beyond personal stuff, money, anything, is hearing about those asshats trashing the place."
30950,"Winters can be pretty brutal and if you don't like hockey you'd better learn to. Besides that, it's a pretty great country. Specifically Ontario, that may be biased though."
30951,Vancouver is expensive af.
30952,Hence why BC is given the nickname of Bring Cash
30953,"Michigan, USA"
30954,"Southwest Michigan is great.  Chicago would be your nearby metropolis, the area has a nice lakefront, and there is a wine industry.  Eastern Michigan sucks."
30955,"Oakland county in eastern Michigan is pretty nice.  Other than that, yeah its pretty boring."
30956,Michigan is an amazing place and you should definitely move here. Especially the upper peninsula. There's no place like it on earth.
30957,Shh!  You're not supposed to fucking tell them!
30958,"roads are shit. it has to do with the materials used, which IIRC are the worst in the nation. combine that with lots of snow and then lots of salting they deteriorate faster than they could be patched. Also, Economy still hasn't recovered entirely from 2008"
30959,"Belize, it seems like the best central American country for a US citizen."
30960,"a nice nordic country, sweden or finland or Norway or Denmark. They dont get very warm, good social policies that seem to work."
31461,USA
30962,There's just way too much freedom and opportunity
30963,Depends on where in the US.
30964,The Us
30966,Yea I love living in California ;)
30967,But bring your own water.
30968,"England or Italy perhaps, I want to get out of expensive, dark and cold Finland."
30969,"USA for me - Somewhere like Boston or Seattle

p.s I am from Australia"
30970,Having never been to either city I am qualified to advise you to go to Seattle.
30971,Both great cities but the hipster problem in Seattle has really gotten out of control. The last time I was home I was blown away...like a cockroach infestation wearing grandpa's old plaid pants.
30972,"Jesus, everyone in this thread so worried about hipsters. Sure I find them annoying but its not like its an actual problem. I lived in sf for 4 years, I've seen my fair share of hipsters. Just ignore them and move on with your day."
30973,Austria.
30974,"1.  Arizona or New Mexico of the Southwestern United States. 

2. Costa Rica"
30975,"Arizona and New Mexico have some of the worst education systems in the country. 

Phoenix is hot as fuck.

If you don't live in a major city (Phoenix, Flagstaff, ABQ, Santa Fe, Las Cruces), you're probably in a pretty small town about an hour from the nearest town. I guess some people would like that, though.

That being said, I have family in NM and it's a gorgeous place."
30977,"Gary, USA"
30978,Shot up heroine qith my buddies while running from the cops and high school gang members at the same time. 10/10 Only two of us died.
30979,"I'm going to put in a vote for Chile. First world country, fairly easy to get residency, climate like California but a cost of living like Indiana. Good health care system."
30980,interesting
30981,Indiana or India?
30982,Did I stutter? ;)
30983,"Probably the best to travel and see. If you are having trouble making life long friends among people you have been around with decades then it may be very unlikely you would be able to make those friends in a different country. I have seen many somewhat lonely people try to start anew somewhere else in the world because they can't relate to the United States but have even more trouble being on their own in a new country.

That being said, if you have spent considerable time over in a new country and have had great success then go for it."
