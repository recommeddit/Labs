I got my dad an AEG cordless drill to replace a shitty Ryobi. makes jobs around the house a lot more easier."

Let him sleep. Give him quiet and let him be. Allow him to go solo for a while and not have to do a bunch of shit."

12296,Dad we are going out for dinner I made reservations. Btw you're still paying.
12297,"*dad wakes up* I'm hungry...me- ""high hungry I'm 666"""
12299,"Scotch.

My dad loves scotch, so we get him a bottle of stuff he's never tried before."
12300,I genuinely wish I'd put a lot more effort into fathers day. My dad died a couple of year ago when I was 24. I'm now a dad myself I have a 1 year old. A gift doesn't have to be expensive or even physical. Time is free so use as much of it as you can. My dad died at 48 which is no age at all.
12301,"my dad and I love Tabasco sauce, so I like to get him the sampler bottles of different flavors."
12302,"My dad really likes to take walks, but he has really shitty shoes. I'm getting him a gift certificate JUST FOR SHOES. I'm making my mom enforce this rule. He has a really shitty pair that he mows the lawn in and his work boots. 

My 2 year old daughter is getting her daddy a new hat because even she thinks the inside of it is yucky."

12304,"A day all for yourself. no obligations, no guild or blame afterwards."
12306,No no no. You're seeing that wrong: it's an excuse not to do shit *and* not to get any nagging for it.
12307,This man knows.
12308,Cheesecake. I send the man a cheesecake. He loves it more than anything. There's sites online that sell nice ones and ship them frozen.
12309,My wife and mother of my child wants a beer brewing kit.
12311,Unexpected
12312,/r/Homebrewing probably has some good advice. I would recommend against getting a Mr. Beer kit because it makes about 10 bottles for roughly the same amount of work to make 50 bottles with a regular kit.
12313,"Thanks.  There's a store here in St Paul called Northern Brewer and they have start up kits that a bit more complex versus the amazon or groupon home brew kits.  
A box for $30 makes 48 bottles.  

Does that sound like more a reasonable buy? 

Edit: I meant the $30 ingredient box.  
The start up kit is $90 - $140.  

I think I'll go get it today while I have some time off"
12314,"Northern Brewer is a well known, high quality retailer and online store for homebrewers. Definitely one of the better ones out there. Since you're in their area, I'd suggest a visit to the shop and talk to them and get suggestions on what to get her - ingredients and equipment.

Just to set your expectations, $30 is probably just for an ingredient kit. You'll also need equipment, so budget about $150 for a starter set. Definitely hit up /r/homebrewing though - lots of advanced stuff, but a ton of beginner info too.

It's a hell of a fun hobby :) I love making beer! I started right about when my son was born because I knew I was going to have about seven weeks off of work to help take care of him, and I also made a bunch of beer.

It was a really special event on his first birthday to drink a year old porter that I made the day before he was born."
12315,"Northern Brewer is fantastic, you're lucky that they're local.

The $30 box is almost certainly an ingredient kit, you also need equipment like a fermenter, siphon, bottling equipment and a big boil kettle.

I would recommend [this starter kit](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/beer-equipment-starter-kits/essential-brewing-starter-kit.html) with [this kettle](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/brew-kettles/5-gallon-stainless-kettle.html) for doing 5 gallon batches."
12316,"I've been asked for lots of kitchen stuff (specialty baking supplies and the like). Unless they ask, though, don't go buying things that imply housework needs to happen (like a vacuum) or you're going to have a bad time.

Is she into knitting or crochet? A few skeins of high quality yarn or a nice sewing basket are a great gift. Does she like games? Get a Nintendo 2DS or 3DS and some games (my wife loves Professor Layton games). Does she love tea? Find her favorites and put together a tea kit (tea, nice mug, cookies). 

Basically, find something she enjoys and get something that will increase or allow enjoyment."
12317,"As someone who crochets, I would warn against yarn gifts.  Usually they are difficult to find the right project for (I buy yarn for the project, I don't create a project to use up yarn), and therefore can sit around unused for years.  If you go that route, make sure they are returnable / exchangeable."
12318,"For the yarn, make sure the same color is from the same lot number and don't just get one."
12319,"Massage, new coffee maker, coffee, gift card for local coffee shop. Gift card for new clothes, picture frames, homemade coupons for foot rub, back rub, kitchen cleaning, afternoon baby-free, a night out with friends, (not that she should need coupons for this, but I think it's cute anyway.) Fancy shampoo/conditioner/body wash. (I see showers as mini vacations, it's nice to have nice stuff in there.) Printer for baby pictures, magazine subscription, new book by fav author, nice journal."
12320,Maid service gift certificates
12321,"This was my wife's ""push present"" last year. Taking the stress of a dirty house off a new mother's shoulders was a homerun."
12322,"That worked? My wife felt the need to clean before the maid arrived, ""So she doesn't know how dirty the house gets!"" It was a huge stressful thing.

I clean the house instead."
12323,"Note: I'm assuming that when you say ""mom"" here, you're not actually talking about YOUR mother, you're talking about your child's mother. I also assume that you are in a relationship with or married to her. If my assumptions are incorrect, throw this away.

Stocking Stuffers:

* High end lip balms. The sweet/minty kind she loves.
* Lotion infused socks.
* A cheap paperback book for her to sit and read.
* An orange or clementine (tradition, yo)
* Some candy if she's into such things.
* 
If the kids are little, and she'll see the mirth in the idea, a pair of stockings to go into her stocking. Something small and sexy so she knows she still lights your fire.

BOOM. Stocking. Done. Right.

From there, it's all a matter of budget. I like a smattering of things. Skip the jewelry. She'll love it, but if you've got wee ones, she'll avoid wearing it so that it doesn't get broken. Avoid practical gifts. I know, I know, that new vacuum she's been hinting about sounds awesome. Save it for a ""new years"" gift to the family. You ""bought it on an after-christmas-sale for a song."" Seriously, avoid stuff that is for the household.

* That said, Coffee/Tea/etc. If you've got room, and the kids are old enough, take them to a 'paint your own ceramic' place. Put a year on it. Bonus points for making one every year. If the child is entirely too little, get their hand wet with paint, and put a hand print on the mug. Fill the mug up with biscotti or similar breakfast cookie type things.

* A new robe. One that doesn't have stains on it from kids spitting up. The super soft and fuzzy kind. Bonus if you include lounge pajamas that go with it. 

* If you live close enough, and it's in the budget, consider a membership to a massage place. It'll give her one massage a month for an entire year. Although, that is a ~$600 investment, so might be out of the budget. However, you tend to pay monthly, and $50/mo might be very doable. 

* A TV series on DVD/BluRay. Something she can do a watching marathon on when the kid is sleeping/at school/etc.
* Gift cert for a pedicure. Extra-credit if you get two, so she can take a friend. 
* A bath set, water proof book, and a bottle of champagne, complete with a chilling bucket. Note that this only works if you've got a bath tub. Note that water proof books tend to end up in either meditation or erotica categories(Not an issue at my house). Alternately consider a water-resistant case for her tablet or phone."
12324,"> Lotion infused socks

I had no idea these were even a thing. My wife thanks you in advance!"
12325,Whelp... several of these ideas will be filling out my wife's Christmas this year... the others will do for next year.  You sir...  you... just.... you... *wipes away tear*
12326,"The first Christmas after my daughter was born, I bought my wife a necklace with out daughter's birthstone on the charm.  It is one that can be added on to for any future little ones."
12327,"I did that for her Mother's day... her reply was ""Why is the stone blue?""    ""It's aquamarine.""  *blank look*  ""Our... son's... birthstone?"" ""Ohhhhhhh""

Wives, amiright?"
12328,Haha. I got that same sort of look. But then she noticed the insert in the box our jeweler added. It's a nice write up about what the birthstone means and something about becoming a mother.
12329,"A weekend away, get grandparents to look after the kids and take your wife away for some grown up time. I've booked a little trip to Edinburgh for myself and my wife. It's a win win as I get away from the kids and have time with the woman I love. 

Also as someone else posted, buy her a book and put in it a voucher that gives her the time to read it and the kids some time with Daddy."
12330,"Might have to pay extra for fast shipping at this point, or maybe save it for Mother's Day, but etsy.com is full of nice handmade ""mom"" themed handmade paintings and jewelery."
12331,"Perhaps some alone time? I know for my wife, a few hours (or an afternoon) to herself, to do as she pleases, would go a long way."
12332,I got my wife this http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0044TSSKM/ref=mp_s_a_1_10/175-5052369-9342733?qid=1418663153&sr=1-10&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 jewelry box recently. She LOVES it!
12333,A hundred and what now?
12334,Give her [the world](http://visuo.com/85-natural-earth-c-3_40/).
12335,"hahaha...outsourcing gift ideas...I love it.
Tickets to a play/show are a good one."
12336,Bullets and a new purse holster
12337,"Not sure why this is being downvoted - I know plenty of women who carry responsibly and enjoy shooting. I she's into it, this gift makes perfect sense."
12338,"I asked for a new wedding band (not a super expensive to one) and some pink Sapphire earing since Sapphire is my daughter's birth stone, etsy has some great things, I would love a maid and to not worry about cooking too"
12339,I found the 8mm film reels from our childhood and had them converted to vhs. Many onions were cut that Christmas.
12340,"My dad and I want to do this for my mom; did you find a website that does it? We have so many VHS tapes, I’m wondering how expensive it’ll be."
12341,Check local public libraries.  I know the two in my metro area have the equipment to transfer VHS to DVD.
12342,"My mom and stepdad were slowly collecting pieces from a Homer Laughlin China set over the years they were married. Unfortunately he passed from lung cancer before they could complete it. We happened to be in an antique store one day and saw the complete set for $50. Bought it immediately. She cried so much that day and she tells us nearly every day how much she loves that set. 

I'm not sure what I'm gonna do this year though..."
12343,That's the thing about finding the perfect gift: you can never top it! But that sounds like it was a real winner.
12344,Good work!
12345,Maybe see if you can get her something special to display the set?
12346,"I spoke with her boss to secretly get her a day off work so we could go shopping and have dinner. As a guy I grew up sulking about being dragged around shopping as a kid so I can see she really appreciates me putting in some enthusiasm for it with her. Also, as I get older, I realise experiences and moments with people are much more valuable than things."
12347,"Yes, experiences, time and moments are the most valuable. 

My mother died of lung/brain cancer 3 years ago. She was living in another city with my father and barely had the time to know my first son. She died 1 month and a half after my second son was born and she was already somewhere else in her mind and never knew...

I’d like to go back in time and have more moments with her.

My dad has since moved near me and has tongue/throat/lung cancer. I cherish all the moments with him. I’m going to see him today.

You never know what will happen to your beloved one, so yeah what you said is really important.

Cheers"
12348,So sweet :')
12349,"My mother saw this ring once years ago - white, yellow and red Clogau gold oak leaves, wound round into a ring. Really tiny, detailed leaves, gorgeous. She couldn’t afford it at the time, saved up for it, and when she went back it had been discontinued. This was about 7 years ago. 

Last year she realised it was on sale again, and again couldn’t afford it herself. So me, my sister, and my brother-in-law clubbed together to get it for her. She shouted at us for spending so much on her, but she also cried like a baby and hasn’t taken it off since."
12350,That sounds really pretty! Would your mom mind sharing a picture of the ring?
12351,"Not at all, I’ll grab her later and get one posted. They do some really lovely stuff, Clogau."
12352,"I think they're talking about this one:

https://www.clogau.co.uk/jewellery/item/royal-clogau-oak-ring-olr01"
12353,"I gave her a beautifully framed picture of my father and her kissing on their wedding day.

It was a photo she'd never seen before that my grandmother gave me."
12354,"Heyyyy, good idea. Going through old pictures at my grandmas I found a really good one of her that my mom probably hasn't seen in forever, if at all."
12356,"That's a lovely Christmas surprise. But, holy shit. $70? An hour flight where I live is over $300.00. Booking it months in advance might get you mid $200s."
12359,"Probably some bullshit reason like ""there isn't enough people buying flights to lower prices"" when in fact lowering the prices would likely lead to a lot more people buying flights. Or because the companies know they can take advantage of people because people will end up buying flights when needed regardless of cost. Or... well there's a lot of possibilities honestly.

Edit: it's a mix of both, but moreso the major issue is the airport fees/taxes. The rent airports pay to the government is ridiculous. If that was lowered, it would likely lower cost of flights and allow more competitive airlines to come to Canada."
12360,Yep. I live in BC.
12361,My ~2.5 hour flights round trip to school can be under $100 on good days if you fly the budget airlines
12362,"Excuse me what? That just sounds insane to me. Aside from holiday periods, national flights in NZ run from $35 (smaller cities) to $70 ( large cities) as the standard non-sale price. That’s about $27 - $54 USD."
12363,"I’m going to throw up. It cost me $400 to fly round trip to a city not even half-way across my province. Pourquoi, Canada? Pourquoi???"
12364,Erm what
12365,"One time, when I was super broke and couldn't afford to travel to where my parents were living, I made it happen. A friend was passing through my town and I hitched a ride, then used a complicated series of rides and couches from other friends to stay away from my parents'house until my mom was at work and I'd had a chance to get a few hours of sleep. I knew when she went to lunch every day so about five minutes before hand, a friend and I walked into my mom's office to take her out to lunch. She bawled. We all cried. It was one of the best moments I've had with my mom. I miss her."
12367,"I'm in Cambodia right now, and I'm about to take a 1 hour flight instead of a 10 hour bus for $70"
12368,"Nah mate... aussie here, car trip down is bout 10 hours, its a 1 hour flight though"
12369,My brother and I getting along
12370,"This, to the 1000th degree!"
12371,I had a baby on my mom's birthday one year.... that was a hit.
12372,Do you know which store sells those?
12373,I saw an endcap in Target yesterday
12374,See you shoulda said walmart and more people would believe you...
12375,The Target babies are of marginally higher quality. The Walmart ones are like those “surprise inside” toys so it’s a mystery what you get.
12376,So whats the dollar general babies? Do they come in a multipack from china?
12377,"You're paying way too much for babies man.
Who's your baby guy?"
12378,It’s like the off brand toys that look like crappier versions of the real toy. Iron man? How about vaguely red and gold plastic man?
12379,Got it. baby-like vague replicas.
12380,">yeah, but they can't legally call them babies, so they are 'tiny childeren' or 'mini humens'."
12381,Dick’s
12382,DM me for details
12383,"My mum went into labour with me on her birthday,popped out the day after"
12384,Haha me too!  They and my cousin share the most common date of Birthdays in Australia.   Next bubs is due on my youngest cousins birthday so that would be too funny.
12385,"My mother loves perfume. Sometimes not even to wear, she just likes having scents at hand. Smells that remind her of childhood, smells that remind her of sunny days. 

I work for a company that has a very large line of naturally sourced perfumes. Over the previous year I stockpiled every free type I got - solid perfumes, spray bottles, dropper bottles - and sent around thirty to her in one go. She was over the moon. I get messages nearly monthly about new aspects she noticed in their scent, or what she now associates them with."
12386,"Same thing, mom loved this one perfume that was too expensive for her to consider buying every time she was out but was totally priced within reason to expect from a gift for a family member, so she pretty much requested that from me every year and loved it."
12387,"My mother’s boyfriend died 10 years ago. She recently mentioned he loved wearing Égoïste and that she got him a bottle of it every Christmas. I bought it for her. She sprayed it on her arm and started to cry, tears of loss and memories and joy of experiencing it all again. I think it’s the best present I gave her, and that present made her cry. Life is complicated!!!"
12388,This was so lovely to wake up to this morning. Thank you for sharing this.
12389,"If she likes frangrances, check out Black Phoenix  Alchemy Labs for unique scents. So good."
12390,"My parents forced us four kids to take a picture in the same pose every 3-4 years or so, we kind of stopped doing it after a while. So last Christmas my siblings and I decided to recreate the picture for her present, kept everything super secret and stuff. She couldn’t stop crying happy tears after she opened it, even now she’ll stop and smile when she sees it hung up with the others."
12391,I am stealing this idea! My siblings and I haven’t had a family photo in years and my siblings have kids of their own to include in pictures. Stoked. Thanks! 🙌🏼
12392,"Mine was photo related too!  I found a local photographer and paid for my mother to have a session.  She asked if my dad could be in to photos too, so they got a bunch of shots as a couple in a lovely local historic site.  The next year, my mother had the same photographer take shots of the whole family.  My parents like photos, but hadn’t gotten professional photos since we were little and used to go to Sears, so that gift really landed."
12393,"Did this for my sister in law 2 years ago. She loved it so much and definitely cried. It was pretty hard to gather all 4 of them at the same time, but we got it done lol"
12394,"Awesome I have one similar, my grandparents always had us grandkids and parents take Christmas photos every year for their Christmas cards but stopped after my grandpa died because it just made my grandma sad, so last year we did an updated one all of us as teens and young adults seated based on height with and without spouses, then we did a few recreations of how we sat for a few of the photos the normal and silly ones, was funny having my little cousin sitting in my lap as a teen for that.  My grandma cried seeing the photos and said it is one of the best presents she's gotten from all of us since some of us don't live in the area anymore."
12395,"I'm currently painting the interior of her home for her. Some dude scammed her by charging $3000 to do the lounge/dining room/kitchen, and he did an abysmal job. She works with his partner though, so she won't say anything. I said to her fuck it, let me do it; I'll buy the paint and all that, let it be your christmas present. I'm onto the hallway now and she's absolutely thrilled with the change in how it looks (it was a really dirty looking cream colour, and is now just plain white)."
12396,She should’ve invited them both over to show them how it turned out and hope the one she works with sees that it was horrible!
12397,"Oh believe me, I was ready to flay him alive but you know ma's type: Wouldn't kick up a fuss for the end of the world haha"
12398,"It depends on what my mom is into.  She switches hobbies like some people switch underwear.   This summer, she was really into camping, so, for Mother's Day, I made her a camping kit.  One year she was really into healthy cooking so I got her a grow-your-own herb kit, some cookbooks, and a grocery store gift card.   One year she was into making her own sugar scrubs, so I got her a kit of essential oils and some decorative containers. 

I don't have much money, so I can't do a whole lot, but I think she is really surprised when she gets something pertaining to her new hobby because it shows that I do listen to her."
12399,Your mom sounds like my mom. A new hobby once a week. A particularly memorable one was juggling. Pretty sure those balls have been sitting in the closet for years now.
12400,I once got my mum a neon pink bobble hat as a joke along with her actual Xmas present. She apsolutely loved it and wore it everywhere. It became a thing that I got her the most obnoxious colour hat I could find every year. She had quite the collection by the time she passed away.
12401,sorry for your loss :(
12402,"I always buy my mom a subscription box.  That way she gets a present every single month.  This past year I bought her a quilting box which she loved.  Next year I am going to do a coffee box. 

&#x200B;"
12403,Quilting box! That would def move me into favorite child territory. Where did you order it from?!
12404,"My sister and I got our mom a year of the NPR Wine Club because she likes 2 things- NPR and alcohol (she's a public school teacher, it comes with the territory).

&#x200B;

Best gift ever. Each wine had a little booklet about how it was made, the profits went to NPR, and they had special bottles named after NPR show (we turned the All Grapes Considered into a vase). She loved it, especially how the survey you filled out at the end of the term adjusted what wines they would send each quarter. 

&#x200B;

Honestly don't know how we can top it this Christmas."
12405,I didn't know these were a thing. These are a great idea. It's like I'm paying for someone else to pick the present but I get all the credit!
12406,Are you a subscription box marketing agent? Cause very nice pitch..
12407,Jelly of the month club
12408,One year I got my mom a six month subscription to Spotify premium and she says it's one of the best things she's ever received.
12409,"Stuff like that my parents would love if they could ever be bothered to learn how to use it. I've tried before with other stuff, it just doesn't stick."
12410,"I work a rotational schedule so on my days off, I go on adventures. I was in montana and found out about sapphire mining.  So I went and found about 150 carats of sapphires and had a few good ones worth getting cut. I ended up getting 13 stones heat treated and cut. I took two of the nice square cut ones and had them made into ear ring or studs or whatever they're called. 

She really liked them"
12411,How do you go sapphire mining???
12412,"It involves going to a mine and purchasing buckets of dirt.  The dirt is planned in a screen and rocked, bounced,  and rotated in a trough of water. The sapphires, being the heaviest stone will migrate to the bottom, center portion of the screen if done properly.  The screen is flipped so the bottom material is on top.  The screen is lifted and collection begins.  Collection involves using a set of giant tweezers and picking the sapphires out and placing in a tube with a diaphragm on top.  Just push the stones into the tube and when you are done. You take them into the shop to be inspected, sorted, and  graded. You then have the opportunity to send them for heat treating (if needed) and faceting. 

I went to Gem Mountain Mine in Phillipsburg MT. I've been back a few times since. There are other moves through out MT. Their procedures, in terms of dirt/gravel collection vary but the process is similar"
12413,this sounds like something to do w/ my wife.
12414,My mom just started her own cupcake business. This year for Christmas I'm making her a custom apron with her business logo and name embroidered on it.
12415,Awww that’s so cute
12416,I bet she'll love that.
12417,Will definitely post once I get it made!
12418,"My mom was always into the Dark Tower series by Stephen King, but never got a copy of the 4th book, and on her birthday I bought her a copy and she was so happy, we both teared up. 

Nice memories"
12419,Does... does she know that there are eight books?
12420,"Maybe she has every other book, but just couldn't track down the 4th"
12421,"My brother's and my plan for this Christmas: a Publix gift card specially designated so my mom can buy fresh flowers each week from New Year's to Mother's Day ($10 a week or so). Then another for Mother's Day to last through most of the summer. She has enough more than enough ""stuff"" (I helped pack it when she moved this year) and doesn't want more, but she loves fresh flowers. She feels guilty spending money on them, even though the bouquets at the supermarket aren't that expensive. So I figure this is the perfect gift!"
12422,My mom loves cute salt and pepper shakers. She also has this 4 peas in a pod necklace. One pea for each of her kids. I got her peas in a pod salt and pepper shakers. She loves them so much she hasn't used them because she's afraid of them getting broken. She keeps them on her nightstand so she can see them all the time.
12423,My mom would love the peas in a pod necklace. She loves jewelry with all her kids represented but it's harder to find for 5 kids vs 2-3.
12424,Etsy is the go-to for stuff like that. Custom orders ftw.
12425,Never thought of that even though I buy other shit on etsy! Thanks!
12426,Etsy is the bane of both my existence and my bank account.
12427,"Taking the time to have diner together. She’s not materialistic. In fact, she is actually thankful when you don’t bother her with the obligation and headache of buying you something"
12428,"My aunt (her biological sister) passed away about 2 years ago (age 40, unexpected death). Last year, my sister and I restored and framed some old pictures of the two together. She absolutely loved it and started crying and we started crying and it was just a cry fest."
12429,"It had been a rough year. I had been arrested about a year and a half previous to that Christmas and was still dealing with much of the more immediate fallout of that, my sister was having some mental health issues, everyone in my family except me had just moved halfway across the country a couple months prior, my great-grandma was wallowing in depression and nobody knew how long she was gonna stick out (she’s *still* with us to everyone’s surprise), and my parents were on and off with the idea of separation and/or divorce.

I take great pride in picking out the perfect gifts for my entire family, but I’ve always had trouble with my mom. She wasn’t working at the time, she doesn’t have much in the way of hobbies outside of just plain relaxing and socialization, she’s not horribly adventurous, and they lived halfway across the country now so buying her an experience would be difficult with no idea what was over there to experience.

I wasn’t really what you would consider outwardly emotional at the time. Although I’ve definitely gotten better at wearing my heart on my sleeve, I can name you the two times through my teen years that I cried and what they were for. That said, I decided I’d write her a letter. A handwritten letter in my nicest cursive about why I love her and why I wouldn’t trade her for the world. I went over the Hell my family had been through that year, talked about how I admired her handling of it throughout all of it, described all the character traits she has that I hope to one day develop or strengthen in myself, talked about how me and people I’ve observed look up to her, and generally just took my natural descriptive rambling and put it to good use.

She was smart enough to find a mildly secluded corner to read it in after I told her I wrote her a letter but not to read it until after everyone’s gifts, but I still got to glance over at her occasionally and see her trying (and failing) to hold in her tears. I’ve gotten plenty of family members gifts that they enjoyed, that made their face brighten up, or simply things that say “I thought of you when buying this,” but writing that letter for my mom and seeing her reaction is a memory I will cherish until I grow into a crotchety old man who can’t even remember if I took my prostate pills at all that week.

That was 4 years ago. I’m thinking I might do it again this year now that some time has passed and I’ve grown even more as a person and tear up every time I start thinking of how little I deserve a family like I was blessed with. I might even do it for all my family members, and only partially because I’m a poor college student that can’t buy 7 people things for every holiday."
12430,"My mom was in the yearbook club when she was in high school, contributing lots of writing and photography that she was proud of. Around 30 years ago my dad accidentally threw out her yearbooks when they were moving. So one year for xmas I did a bunch of research online and managed to find a company that had a digital copy of her senior yearbook, and ordered a reprint. She cried when she opened it."
12431,That’s a really cool thoughtful gift!
12432,"Personalized Photo calendar. I get on my siblings FB page and steal photos off of it and make a photo album. I do it every year and she still loves it, but my mom is a calendar gal"
12433,"I do this for my mom for Mother's Day every year, and she's loves it. No surprises on what she's getting from me, but I know she uses it and loves the family pictures. I always include some old ones too"
12434,That's such a wonderful idea. I know my Mum would love something like that. Mind if I steal it?
12435,"Go for it, there are numerous sites that make it super easy to make one! I use shutterfly because I have a lot of photos saved there and they have always come out well but there are ALOT of different sites."
12436,"My mom has always hated vacuuming, so my brother and I went in on a Roomba for Christmas last year. She loves that thing."
12437,"I think it was 2009 build a bear came out with a moose. My mother likes mooses for some reason.  I unfortunately can't remember why that Christmas my brother and I called our mother Margaret. She couldn't stop laughing at that for some reason. So I have enough money I go to build a bear. Get her the moose, you know I dress the thing in a miss Santa's dress. Now up comes the heart noise button thing. I like humor in my gifts, I'm not going for merry Christmas, no I'm going straight to the dinosaur roar. Yes the store employee asked if I wanted to do the whole give the bear a heart gift,  I fucking did it.  Now comes the name the damn thing, as the post said my mom laughed at my brother and I calling her Margaret I felt that would be the most suitable name. Thus born Roaring Margaret the Moose a Christmas gift.  My mom still has it out and ready to push to make the damn thing roar, and also has put it out as a decoration. I'm 34 now I gave that to her around the time I was 26-27 if I remember right I can't top that gift. 

P.S. on mobile sorry for format"
12438,"Last year was our first Christmas as a blended family. I got my bonus mom a reindeer family ornament with all of our names on it. My dad and her make such a wonderful match, and I wanted her to know that we are happy to be a blended family with her and my step siblings. Not expensive, but she loved it. I think she might have teared up."
12439,When I got a divorce I traded in my wedding band and her engagement ring (she didn't try to keep it) for a set of VERY NICE diamond earrings. My mom had always wanted them and I had never really been able to afford them. Best trade ever.
12440,"My husband and I go extravagant for my mom every year. We got her an expensive watch that years later, she still talks about. We got her a new iPad last year and she loves that she could replace her old one. She is our world, so we treat her as such."
12441,"I got my mom an iPad too! No more squinting at her phone to creep FB or Reddit (hi ma, you’re cool as hell). Such a cool gift to give."
12442,That’s what my mom is getting for Christmas this year!
12443,"I'm into wòodworking and one Christmas I  built my mom a librarian's chair. She had wanted one for years.  She freakin' loved it.

12444,"I made her a tie blanket. (Most) women love blankets, and the fact that it’s home made makes it that much better. 

Also, an instant pot"
12445,"I wrote her a little story. Seriously, short enough to be written for a four-year-old. I wrote it in my best handwriting and bound it in some fancy paper that I bought at the craft store. It cost me maybe 10 bucks in materials, maybe an hour of my time if you count the round-trip drive to the craft store. But I put all my love into the story.

It’s framed and sitting on a shelf by her front door, so it’s the first and last thing she sees as she leaves and comes home every day. It has been there for the last six years."
12446,"When I worked at Staples, I ordered one of their Christmas calendars that you can put your own pictures on. I filled each month with relevant family members. She cried. It actually pissed me off cause I worked my ass off on her present the year before trying to make her cry and nothing😑"
12447,"My mom is super hard to shop for. You can give her a gift, she'll say she loves it and you'll never see it again, like the heart shaped earrings I bought her last year. The only thing I ever saw her really enjoy was a pendant that had a chocolate diamond. This year she's getting gift cards. At least that way I'll know she enjoys her gift."
12448,This is my issue.
12449,"Sounds like my mom, except she prefers to open her gifts in private like 3 months later. I tried gift cards, but they're all in a drawer somewhere."
12450,Tickets to a broadway show
12451,What show?
12452,"An out of print picture book we used to borrow from the library all the time when my siblings and I were little. At the time I purchased it, it was really difficult to find. She always said it was her very favorite picture book and I thought it was crazy we didn't have our own copy. I finally found it online and she was SO excited when she opened it. Did not expect it at all. She doesn't even keep it on the regular bookshelf because she wants it to stay in good condition out of the hands of the little ones now lol."
12453,A green shirt. She was so happy I remembered her offhand comment about her wanting one.
12454,"A luggage tag that says ""FUCK OF THIS IS MY BAG"""
12455,"If your mom is a grandma, once my mom made a custom fabric with a word cloud of everyone in the family's names (Spoonflower) and sewed pillows and napkins out of it. My grandmother, a very cold old lady, cried. I think most grandmas/moms/matriarchs of large families would love this!"
12456,I got her a really fluffy and comfortable bath robe. She uses it all the time.
12457,"For the last decade or so all I've ever bought my mom for christmas is R2D2 merchandise. She loves it, and it has it all displayed. 

But this year I'm thinking of buying her a set of pots and pans, because I used to get stoned and burn pans when I forgot I was cooking food."
12458,"On Etsy there is someone that hand paints plates with penguins dressed in winter gear along with a persons name under it; I put our family on it as well as my nephew; 
The inspiration was making cookies the year before and not having any plates to put them on, so i figured i would get a xmas themed cookie plate; Apparently now its to sentimental to use."
12459,"Shutterfly gifts, photos, etc"
12460,"My mom loves books. Crime, mystery,  thriller, sci-fi. I usually can't go wrong if I get her some good fiction."
12461,"It was a gift I gave her almost as an afterthought. A small candid Polaroid picture of myself laughing at some dumb joke on set. I had it framed and tossed it into her stocking. Out of all of her presents that year, she loves that one the most. She keeps it on her desk to remind her that even though she worries about me being so far away, I'm doing what I love and having a great time doing it."
12462,I had a little wooden outline of a tree made and framed with little inscribed hearts with the names of all her kids and grandkids on the branches. Simple but she loved it.
12463,"For my mother in law, I had a digital painting portrait done of her beloved doggo by http://www.portraitsforpits.com/"
12464,Last year I got my Mum tickets to go see a comedian she really liked. I hadn't given her any hint I was doing it so she was totally surprised when she saw the tickets. She didn't even know he was coming to our city either which made it even better.
12465,My mom's getting where she appreciates experiences over things.  Last year I got her concert tickets to a music group that we both enjoyed and found an authentic German restaurant to eat at before the concert.  She loved it.
12466,My grandfather had just passed and I had some of his favorite old button up shirts turned into square pillow cases for the couch. I got a few made for her brothers and sister.
12467,"My mum fucking loves Kate Spade purses.  Of course, Kate Spade is pricey af.  But last Christmas, I got her this wallet that she had been admiring for months.  And proceeded to cry because she got the wallet she had always wanted."
12468,"My mom has passed, but I am a mom and I will tell you what I really enjoy. 

I got a bathrobe. 11 years later and I still wear it as well as have a collection of other bathrobes.

Candles. I never buy candles in the store because I feel like it's a ""splurge"" or an item I don't actually need. So when I get a candle, I am always excited to use it. 

House shoes. I also have a collection of houseshoes, slippers, fuzzy/warm socks. 

A Chromecast / Kindle fire / camera - all things I used many and multiple times.

A diamond necklace. Like with the candles I do not treat myself to jewelry, but when someone I love buys me something I do cherish it and wear it often."
12469,"My mom loves pearls. So she asked us kids (and my dad) to focus on that for Christmas. She just wanted pearl jewelry. 

Well, wandering around a Walgreens hair aisle one day, and bam. I find it. A pearl hair clip. I got some nice stuff to go with it, like lotion and other take care of yourself stuff. 

She loves it. She still wears it a lot. Mom lost one, so I bought a 2nd. Of course she finds the first one, and is excited to have two."
12470,"I had a photo blanket made for her. It had pictures of the whole family, even some of her childhood photos. She has it hanging in her room and talks about it still."
12471,"I made her a calendar with collages of family pictures for every month. She cried while flipping through it. I did this as an after-thought/extra gift, and she has asked for one every year since."
12472,I got her and framed an original painted cartoon cell from the Flintstones.
12473,"My moms favorite cat had passed away earlier in the year so I got one of her favorite pictures of the cat, scanned it, added a poem I found somewhere and added some basic touches and framed it.  She cried for a bit and told me how much she loved it.  Still hanging somewhere I think."
12474,"My mom had talked about wanting a deep fryer for years, but never got around to getting one. I ordered a promising one off of Amazon for her birthday this year and had it sent straight to her. It fits perfectly on her counter top and she uses it every weekend."
12475,"Last Christmas I gave my mom a bracelet. She is always happy with what I give her, but this bracelet was special. On the bracelet was a quote that we would always say to each other every night before bed when I was growing up. “I love you bigger than the heavens.” I don’t think I’ve said that to her I’m a few years. Seeing it on her bracelet made her cry. I don’t think I’m going to be able to top it."
12476,My mom loves to make quilts and sew. I remember her saying one time how her mom used to make their dresses out of flour sacks they’d buy at the general store (flour was sold in decorative cotton sacks at the time). I found a bunch of old flour sacks on eBay along with an old quilting book. She loved it.
12477,"I found old journals in my moms room that my grandmother (her mother) wrote in every single day. I mean, 7-9 years worth of journals. Starting from before my sisters birth, my brothers and my birth.  The journals ended when I was about 3 or 4 years old because that’s when she died. She wrote in them everyday until she died. I learned a lot from those journals. Anyway, I decided to type the journals. I typed them exactly how she wrote them. I turned it all into a book. I went through old family albums and included pictures. I also Included scanned pictures of my grandmothers journal entries. My mom cried. She cried so hard when she opened that present. It was bittersweet for her as she always misses her parents at Christmas but she loved the present. She immediately read the book of journals I made for her and she still goes back and reads the journals all the time.  It took me about 8 months to make that Christmas present for her. I gave her other presents but saved that one for last as a surprise."
12478,"My mom bitches about how cold the house is in the winter so last year I got her an electric blanket and she fucking loved it so much that she basically would spend all day wrapped up in it or would rush home just to wrap in it.

Forgot to mention I got her a $1000 tablet last year too, but she liked the blanket more"
12479,A glass Cinderella slipper. She always saw herself as a rags to riches story.
12480,"My Mom literally hated (almost) everything everyone ever got for her for Christmas. She was polite enough when presented with whatever it was but would get snarky later. 

We all knew this and so didn't expend much effort after a while.

Well, one year, I bought this stainless steel tea-kettle at I think it was Ross or Marshall's or something (some cheap department store anyway) for my boyfriend's mom - it was cheap-ish, couldn't have been more than $20. 

Well me & the BF had a huge fight right before Christmas and I was clearly dis-invited to anything they had going on. So I wrapped up this tea-kettle and gave it to Mom instead. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. She used it for like the next 20 years and it was still on the stove when my Dad decided she had to go to a nursing home."
12481,New robe and slippers.
12482,A new vacuum cleaner. My mom wanted one.
12483,"An iPad, or perfume, a hand made scarf."
12484,I gave my mom ballet tickets.
12485,Framed photos of close family members
12486,"Books. My mom is super easy, I'm lucky."
12487,"The biggest hits so far have been a felted tote bag that I made, and...a Thermos travel mug.  It turned out to be the perfect travel mug for her needs and preferences.  She loves that thing."
12488,A clock that had pictures of all her children and grandchildren on the hours
12489,"Big 'ol box full of variety stuff they've never tried before: exfoliating bath soaps, those coarse shower gloves that go well with them, few boxes of variety tea (to include herbals and fruits), small sizes of sweet coffee creamer or two (butter pecan is my personal favorite), go to a bakery and get little mini-pies, cookies, rice krispie treats, put it all in the box and take it over.

""Here, a little of everything and some new stuff for you to try.""

She reportedly devoured all of the food in the box in a few days.  Picked up exfoliating soap as a habit from that, too.  Didn't much like all of the tea, but she took a liking to strawberry and peach mixed with chamomile."
12490,"My mom's dad passed two days before Christmas almost 5 years ago. He was a huge part of our lives and for most of her life, he was her only parent. This time of year has been extremely hard for her ever since, so I had a photo of him put in a glass square and wrote a poem to go with it, since Mom and I are both writers for ourselves. Then I got her a Mantraband that said ""Love you more"" because anytime we would get off the phone with Grandpa and say ""I love you"", the last thing he said before he hung up was ""Love you more"".  

Edit: Grammar"
12491,"my mom used to keep photo albums religiously when i was a kid. we have THOUSANDS of photos in at least 15 large albums, but around the time my dad died she slowly stopped taking pictures with a film camera so we have far fewer physical photos from 2004 onward. 5 years ago i printed out as many photos from those 9 years as i could find and organized them into an album for her, and every year since i've quietly stolen back the album (or, once it's full, bought a new one) and added a new section for that year with 50-80 photos. it's not really a surprise anymore, though the first time i gave it to her she got a little emotional. it's something of a tradition now for the album to get passed around through the whole extended family once she's opened it."
12492,A jar filled with 365 small pieces of paper. My kids and I wrote a reason why we love her on each piece. She says that it’s still her favorite gift.
12493,"My mom is in her late seventies and despite having a desk top, she is TOTES not computer or tech literate.

I got her an iPad a few years ago and she just LOVES it.  They are so easy to use and intuitive that once we downloaded some games, books, Facebook and got her email set up there she was addicted.  I think she would have refused if I had offered to buy her one, but since it was wrapped up under the tree, she gave it a try and loved it.  This was probably 5 years ago.  I'm considering upgrading her."
12494,"Oh, I forgot.  Last year I got her a 'bouquet of the month' from a local flower shop near her house. (she's across the country from me.)  She went on and on about how much she appreciated it.  And since it was local, she had no trouble putting a month or two on hold due to travelling etc.  I will probably do this again this year.

&#x200B;"
12495,"A puppy! Me and my sister live in different states and my brother just started college. The puppy gives her another, lower maintenance, kid  to take care of and help with the empty nest.

Disclaimer that I did get the okay ahead of time from my dad that they would be fine with supporting and caring for a dog for the dogs entire life."
12496,"My sister got married last year. Thanks to that, our family finally had some decent pictures altogether (we don't have many) so I used the nicest one of us 4 (includes my dad of course lol) and made it into a large canvas that she can put on the wall

Mum AND dad REALLY liked that. Was so chuffed."
12497,"My dad passed a few years before and that year while going through some boxes hidden in my room, i found a bible that he received from college. He had written his name and notes throughout the book. That Christmas someone cut a lot of onions."
12498,A macaroni necklace
12499,"I went to this designer sample sale in my office building once and there were some crazy good deals - shoes that were maybe anywhere from £300 to £1000 were as little as £20. I was on FaceTime to my mom to show her some sneakers that I knew she'd like, so I bought them for her. Then, about two hours later, they announced this sudden 'flash sale' - everything HAD to go, so they reduced the price of EVERYTHING to £10. It was total madness, but I ended up finding a pair of black biker boots I hadn't seen earlier with butterflies and flowers on them that I knew she'd love. I didn't tell her a thing.

Cut to maybe two weeks later and I'm visiting home. I hand her the sneakers, but then tell her to close her eyes because I have a surprise. She did and she clasped her hands, thinking it was going to be something small. Well, I plopped these large biker boots in her hands, she opened her eyes, and immediately burst in to tears and started clutching at them as if they were a baby and someone was going to steal them! Now, every time she puts them on, her face is glowing because they're her favourite thing I've gotten her, and people always compliment her on them, so she loves getting to name drop the brand.

Fun fact - I price checked them later on, and they retailed for £1500. Steal of the century."
12500,"Flip side here... my favorite gift my kids ever gave me was a little Hallmark book called What I Love About Mom. There were 50 questions and all three kids had answered them. Little things like remembering how I used to play Barbies with them, and how they can always bring their problems to me."
12501,"My parents have enough THINGS at this point in their lives (I'm in my 30s, they are in their late 60s), so I've been gifting them all expense-paid trips the last few years. After insisting it's too much and asking what that cancelation policy is, they surrender to it and end up having an amazing time. 

They spent \~20 years never really going on trips so that I could have an education and career prospects. Makes all the sense in the world to me for me to gift that lost time as much as I can."
12502,"A tree, and home depot gift cards. 

&#x200B;

My parents don't have that much money for frivolous things, but mum really wants to start tidying up their house so they can sell it at some point. So I've just started giving her money that HAS to be used on house stuff - so she can feel free to spend ""wastefully"" on new light fixtures, or a new toilet seal, paint, etc. My mum isn't that effusive, emotionally, but she still likes to point out how useful the new pot rack is, or how she got new paint for the bathroom, so I know she's really very happy to have the money for those things."
12503,"One year I was truly broke so I made her a gift....I  used an old empty can, decorated it with odd bits of ribbon and lace. Then I went to the grocery store and bought paper doilies. On each doilie I wrote a secret about myself or something I have never told her. I folded the doilies to look like flowers so the end result was a rustic-y bouquet.  She pulled a flower out at a time and got to read my secrets. They ranged from confessions ( i was the one who broke the antique radio) to nice ( I always was proud when you came to school because I knew I had the prettiest mom) to funny (I thought babies were born out of your butt when I was little). I added a few special ones that included stuff about my brother who had died when he was 16. I confessed about the time we made fake puke out of salsa and other stuff in the fridge so we could stay home and play Nintendo.  (It worked) . She really loved this gift, I did about 50 doilies so she got to sit there and spend time reading them all, laughing and crying.  She still has them all, keeps them in her China cabinet."
12504,"I made an emergency kit for her a few years ago and she still loves it. I sewed a few ziplock bags onto a potholder and added a button so that it folds in half and protects everything inside it. Each ziplock bag had a theme, like car care or medical stuff or personal care. It stays in the bottom of her purse and is really useful."
12505,Gave her a baby. It was her first grandchild.
12506,Yeah I'm not gonna do this
12507,"""Merry Christmas!  I made a child for you!  Just sign here, here annnnd here"""
12508,"I got all of our home movies that were on VCR tapes transferred to dvd. She hadn’t owned a VCR in years, so we hadn’t been able to watch them in a long time. She cried, I cried."
12509,"i had a picture of her and my grandfather enlarged/framed. it was a simple gift that cost less than $20, but it brought her to tears."
12510,"The year mom became a grandma, my sisters and I decided to get mom a custom grandma mug.  She used that mug every day until it broke this year.  We’re replacing it for her for Christmas this year, and I think she’ll be really happy with the new design."
12511,"Gift cards to her favourite clothing store. My mum endured years of crazy presents from my sibling and I, once we hit 30, she politely asked us to give her gift cards for Christmas and her birthday."
12512,"A really high quality, soft, comfy nightgown that zips up."
12513,I made her some jackets
12514,"One christmas I gave my mom this little necklace with a small, oval tigerseye and she was over the moon for it and wears it nearly every day. I knew she liked that type of stone, but wow."
12515,Death. She died giving birth to me.
12516,"Got her a weekend tip to London with me to see the Phantom of the Opera.

That was a good one, but I hadn't really thought through the cost of flights and hotel beforehand, but it was worth it."
12517,Hired cleaning service to come by a few days before the relatives arrived so she could relax.
12518,"Bath “sand”.  I tried making homemade bath bombs, but it didn’t work out well, so I ground it down to a sort of sand-like substance.  She’s asked for it two years in a row now, and I suspect this will be the third."
12519,"When buying a gift for any one, the way to go about it is to ask this: what do they *desire*, but would never buy them selves?

For example, my mother loves cordial cherries, fucking loves them. But she never buys them for herself, she considers that a unnecessary luxury.

But as a gift, they are perfect: she likes them, it shows that i pay attention to her liking them, and their relatively inexpensive so i can get a fair amount."
12520,My mom was looking really hard for a watch but couldn't decide on her own what to get. I'd gone with her to a few places and knew pretty much what she wanted based on what she'd said when she tried stuff on. I knew she would have been happy enough picking out her own watch but I found one that she claims is more perfect than anything she could have picked out. And more she can make the joke that she thinks about me all the time when she sees it.
12521,I found a nice photo from my parents wedding of my mum and her dad so I got it printed on canvas. She nearly cried saying that her Dad looked so proud in the photo and she loved it.
12522,"* Old drawings when you were a kid
* Random bullshit piece of technology that makes her life way easier
* Scratch off tickets, why? Why do they like them so much?
* Free oil changes / car maintenance for a year
* Do this one, AAA membership.
* Go see her and tell her you appreciate her."
12523,"Gin. She's got a bit of a problem, but at least she's easy to buy gifts for!"
12524,"She's always cold, and she has really enjoyed Gwen Frostic prints for as long as I can remember. So I got her an Afghan blanket that has Gwen Frostic art on it. Unfortunately it was smaller than I would have hoped but she really likes it.

This year, I think I am going to get her an electric blanket that plugs into the cigarette lighter of the car. Can't use it while driving obvs but my brother-in-law has one and swears by it for when he's riding shotgun. Seems like something she would really like."
12525,"She wanted a new sewing machine. I asked her what she needed, what she would be using it for, then I did my research. Dad and I got our wallets together and found her a nice machine she still loves to use."
12526,"For the last three years i get her another part of her tattoo sleeve. [Also on her bday and mothers day] Since she hates pain, she can only tolerate a little bit at a time. She absolutely lives it.

Its an alice in wonderland themed right sleeve"
12527,"My mom once saw a Tom Ford lipstick in a magazine and loved the shade (she is very specific about the shade of red lipstick she likes to wear), but it’s really hard to find stores that sells Tom Ford makeup products in the country she lives. She also hates buying things online. So I went to a store close to my university and bought the lipstick she wanted. 

She’s worn it everyday since :)"
12528,A banjolele. They're cheap and really different from the standard stuff. She already played the uke.
12529,"Probably the best one I've ever given her will be this year actually.  It's a birthday/christmas gift.  She's coming down this weekend to spend thanksgiving with us (from NY, I live in the south), and her birthday is during the time she's down here..  I got my wife to teach me to crotchet, and watched videos to learn as well.  So, I crotchet'd her a prayer shawl over the last few weeks.  I expect a lot of tears lol, can't wait."
12530,"She likes when I make homemade stuff.  I've made pajamas, robes, pillowcases, duvet covers, etc.  Presents for her cats are always a bit hit, too.  I got her a cats a big carpeted tower a few years ago."
12531,My sister and I saved up and paid for a week long cruise for our parents. They really liked that.
12532,"This is what my mother said translated to English, 

>""I don't want anything son. All I want, all I work for is for you to be successful so I can finally take a break. (But I do want some new boots).""


Edit: I guess I really have to get those boots now. Have a Merry Christmas season."
12533,"I read this comment out to my mother and she laughed in my face. ""A dinner with dad and your brother wouldn't hurt, would it?""

Love her."
12534,Read that in my mom's voice.
12535,I read that in your moms voice too.
12536,I read it in their dad's voice
12537,Can confirm. Am Daddy.
12538,"Daaaaaaad, get off Reddit!"
12539,"Your mother sounds lovely. 😊 

You'd better get her some great boots....."
12540,This made me depressed because I can't see my mom due to me being in another state. And I won't see her till this Christmas for a little bit then I'll have to go back....  Fuck growing up.  Lol
12541,"Never grow up, it’s a trap!"
12542,Good guy Peter Pan technically stopped kids from growing up.
12543,For a few seconds I wondered wat Spiderman has to do with that. I'm not a morning person.
12544,"""So hurry up and be successful, because I'm getting tired.  Love you."""
12546,Get her a vacuum but get her one that a robot that cleans the house for you.
12548,┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
12549,Yes exactly that. Clean.
12551,"Give me one day where I don't have to do anything. Do the washing, make dinner, and leave me alone."
12552,"To amend to this, I would like it all to be done in my absence to my standards. Not **good enough** standards.

Honestly, I would like a day of thank yous and just appreciation for all the little things I do that I feel no one notices."
12553,I'm so with you on this. I don't care so much about the cleaning because my children are young but I would like some appreciation.
12554,Do kids not do this anyway? At least kids who are old enough to be posting on Reddit? Geez
12555,My kids do this. I'm not used to it at all. I spent 12 years catering to every whim and now I hardly see them anymore. They never tell me about their friends. I would wager the op has young kids. What I want is for my kids to spend time with me doing things that I want to do with them.
12556,I think this is a cryptic code telling them she wants them to move out
12557,"In 1968 I bought my mum a kitchen knife and an album of bagpipe music. I only had 20c.

She cried .. so not that."
12558,My inner mom says she was crying because you got her a present and she was touched. My kids never get me anything (their Dads fault) so any gift would seem very thoughtful.
12559,NEVER? damn
12560,Never.
12561,"It's not uncommon. It may be that as it's considered her job to care about such things, she gets to remember everyone else's birthday and be sure they each get their own cake, but as it isn't anyone else's job, she never gets given cake herself. 

It can happen where there is no abusive intent, for example when the husband lacks empathy skills. [Here is an example so common the therapist made a composite story of it ](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/married-with-undiagnosed-autism-why-women-who-leave-lose-twice-0420164)

""When he does not acknowledge her birthday, and she asserts that his behavior has upset her, he may respond that he did not mean to upset her; therefore, she shouldn’t be upset. Or he might tell her that because birthdays come once year and everyone has them, they are no big deal and she should stop making such a big deal about them. Or he could tell her they celebrated her birthday last year. Or that birthdays are for children. In other words, he may hold her to the same idea regarding birthdays he holds himself. ""

""She does it because it is important to her, for example, that the children’s birthdays are celebrated. She wants them to have fun. She wants them to have one special day a year that is all about them. She sees this as normal.

Daddy doesn’t agree, so he doesn’t participate.""

""Mommy does it all, from the planning to the present buying to the cake decorating, at home or at the bakery. She chats with all the parents who bring their own children to celebrate. She cleans up after the party. She is exhausted. She says so. Her husband may respond by saying, “Well, you’re the one who had to have this big party! You asked for it.” He may not help with the cleanup because, well, it was “her idea to have the party.”

""...She is not thinking the children learn how to treat their mother by observing the way their father treats her."" 

""She is operating on the assumption her children know her and love her and they see she is a good person. She is unaware that negative lifelong attitudes toward her are being formed in the young minds of the children she loves so dearly..."""
12562,"My dad always made sure he bought us stuff to give to my mum on Christmas, her birthday and Mother's Day. Now all he has to do is remind my brother.

He didn't one year and he turned up about 4 hours later than planned, still high on coke with a birthday card, on Mother's Day. It's the only time I've seen my mum cry unhappy tears on Mother's Day."
12563,"When I was about 15 I found out that when Christmas came around, my mom was the one that bought every single present under the tree. The presents from Santa (I knew that previously, but eh). The presents from my dad to her (later step-dads). Ones from grandparents to us. Basically everything, with the exception of when I bought her Christmas presents. So she always cherished my presents because it was something she didn't buy herself."
12564,That's beautiful. I see your mom in so many women in my life. I can just imagine how much love she felt from whatever you gave to her.
12566,This changed my entire perspective of my mother and made me feel so guilty for thinking the things the children in this story think.
12567,"Yep. My son went out with my mum to buy me a present when he was about 7. He was fixated on the idea of buying me a nice tea cup or coffee mug. I have no idea why because he knew well that I didn't drink either. It was such a weird present but mum told me that he took her to 3 shops trying to find the exact right thing. So the set of mugs became one of my favourite gifts because he put so much (muddled) thought into it. And yes, I cried."
12568,The first time I got a gift from my kids it was because the school pulled their names for this event they just started doing. They would take a few kids from the elementary school and couple them with seniors from the high school. They would go on a field trip to a department store like Wal-Mart with a budget of $100 And help them buy their loved ones gifts for Christmas. My son got me a copy of the movie Pitch Perfect. I cried. It was so sweet that he thought of me and wanted to make me laugh. I still watch that stupid movie often.  I love it because of my son.
12569,"Depends on how old you were at the time, your mum may have cried happy tears because it was sweet gesture, you were young and broke and still got her something."
12570,"I would have just turned 8.
My mum is awesome but I think that particular christmas was just too much, first one in a new house ($3500 mortgage!) in a new country .. I asked her about it not too long ago but she can't remember it anymore. We had a cardboard box table and milk crates for a few months while waiting for our stuff to get from england by boat. I have fond memorys of those early days in australia, swimming in winter etc. Was in Adelaide .. I shudder at the thought now.

They still had the record up to a decade ago, it looked brand new and just as crappy as the day i bought it. I remember playing about 30 seconds of it once.
Absolutely the worst record ever .. it wasnt even a good recording."
12571,"Those were sentimental tears then, I guess. Must have been overwhelming for your mum all the changes and your present must have been the sweetest thing. 

I’ve a 9 year old nephew and last year was tough for me, his innocent sweet cards and drawings for me brought me to tears more than once."
12572,"To add some context, we lived here for 4 months before we got the house..

12573,"A wedding invitation between you and that nice girl I mentioned earlier to you.  You know, Sandy's kid.  She went to Wellesey and visits her grandmother every other Saturday.  She's a nice girl - why don't you really get to know her?  You both have a lot in common.  You both like the Facebook and listen to the same talking music with the African American gentlemen.

Have you eaten yet?  Why haven't you called?  I would call you, but I can't figure out this phone - where's the call button?

-Your mom"
12574,"Mom, we talked about this. Pushing girls on me stopped being cute after my wedding. You're going to piss off my wife."
12575,You said this as a joke but I swear to you my SO's grandmother tried to set her up on a date 10 years into our relationship.
12576,How did your SO's date go ?
12577,She got laid
12578,Hell for free food and drinks I'd put out to
12579,Hi there. It's me ur date :)
12580,Hey babi showe me bob and pusay
12581,SO-SO
12582,"> You both like the Facebook and listen to the same talking music with the African American gentlemen.

This is sweet =)"
12583,It should be gentleman because she doesnt realize it isnt all the same artist
12584,">  I would call you, but I can't figure out this phone - where's the call button?

This triggers me.  My mother absolutely refuses to learn how to text, says it's too complicated.  I know for a fact she can read and spell, and those are the two primary skills required.  I took a look at her phone when I was visiting for Thanksgiving, and it had 300+ unread texts.  Infuriating."
12585,My dad can read texts but not respond. HOW.  THE REPLY BOX IS RIGHT THERE.
12586,"Careful. My dad was like yours, then my sister taught him to text. Now if you call him, he'll ignore your call and text you ""what"" like 3 days later."
12587,"My dad knows how to text, but usually his texts are so unintelligible that I end up having to call to try and cipher out what he meant."
12588,"I'm pretty sure ""You're no child of mine"" is quite clear."
12589,"My dad sends ""call me"" texts all the time. I've told him the special kind of heart attack that gives me, but he keeps doing it."
12590,"My dad leaves me ""hey it's me at [TIME]. Call me back."" Voicemails for everything if I don't answer. I'm not sure if he realizes that I can see when and what time he called. So I'll call him back and it'll be just some casual question that coild be a text or a thing he saw or whatever. Never anything important. 

But I'll always listen to them even if I know exactly what it is, because one day, he won't be leaving them anymore."
12591,Well that turned from annoyance to sweet but dark in hurry.
12592,">With the African American gentlemen

This is hilarious and adorable at the same time."
12593,"Yeah.. My mom told me in July to ""Clear yours and your bf's calendar for Dec 30th. You're getting married.""  This was our Christmas gift to her, apparently.  My fiance has been calling it the arranged marriage.  I asked her what she actually wanted for Christmas and she said ""For you two to stop delaying it and get married already.""


We've been together for 9 years, so why not. /shrug."

M...mom?"
12595,CLEAN THE FUCKING HOUSE.
12596,Properly.
12597,Anyone who takes a rag and just rubs back and forth on carpet expecting to get the stain out never learned from their mother the correct way to do it. PRESS AND SOAK YOU IDIOT. PRESS. AND SOAK.
12598,That doesn't really do shit either. The best solution is to rip the carpet off of the fucking ground and get rid of it because it's a horrible human invention.
12599,No argument here lol
