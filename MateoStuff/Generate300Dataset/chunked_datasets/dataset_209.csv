68964,"In no particular order: Dune, A Canticle for Leibowitz, Rendezvous With Rama.

Ask me in a week and it might be different though."
68966,"I’ve probably bought it half a dozen times because I want a copy to own but keep giving it away to people who I think would benefit from reading it. I’ve put off reading the sequel, but I just picked up a copy at a used book store a few months ago and I might finally get around to it over the next year or so. I’m sure it won’t be up to par with the original."
68968,"It might be my favorite sci-fi book, now that I think of it."
68969,"I’m reading Dune for the first time right now. Really, really good."
68970,The blessings of Muad’Dib be upon you!
68971,"Those are also three of my top five favorites. A Canticle for Leibowitz is fascinating to me, read it multiple times over the years."
68972,"The last line of Rendezvous with Rama gave me chills.

[spoiler](/s ""Not sure the way the series ended was that good though"")"
68973,"The sequels gave me chills.  ... no, wait, that was nausea."
68974,"Oh, just heaps of garbage. Read every one, of course, but complete and utter garbage."
68975,Yeah just not that great after the amazing first one
68976,If only the sequels had paid off on the promise of that line...
68977,Right. Rama II was....decent but kinda like the Hyperion series it failed to deliver at the end
68978,Multi-dimensional stuff let me down.  He put more thought into the original.
68979,"I must confess it took me a while to work out what the last line meant.  But yes, Chills."
68980,I grabbed the book off of my shelf to check the last line and I am not following......
68981,I was really into the story and at the time didn't know there were 3 more books. The last line promised more story that I had yet to discover.
68982,I see I see. Thank you!
68983,"1. Spin by Robert Charles Wilson
2. We are Legion (We are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor
3. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams's

To be fair I have at least 10 favorite books on my top 3 list."
68984,Bob!!! I just finished the fourth book in that trilogy. It was great to check in with the Bobs again
68985,4th book?
68986,"Came out a week ago. Grab it, quick!"
68987,"Well now I’m bummed out. It’s Audible only, no print or ebook edition."
68988,"I totally get that audiobooks aren't for everybody, but Bob is literally made to be read aloud. The narrator does a great job with all the different iterations of Bob and making them feel unique."
68989,I believe those come out in January. Audible just has a 3 month exclusivity window.
68990,"I literally finished it between the time I posted and your reply.

These are not the most groundbreaking stories, but I just find the Bobs to be extremely relatable. Well, most of them anyway... You know what I mean."
68991,Fourth book!? Oh boy! Crap. I've already got a few lined up with the library. Oh well. So good!
68992,This comment just made my week! Brbwtb
68993,"Abbadons Gate (the expanse)
Oryx and Crake 
Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"
68994,Upvote for Oryx and Crake by Atwood. Handmaid's Tale gets the most attention but O&C is a great speculative novel also set in a world that's very different but recognizable to our own.
68995,Yeah I really love it. When I read the southern reach series it felt like it was trying to replicate its magic
68996,"Hyperion, End of eternity, Dune."
68997,Nice. I rarely see End of Eternity mentioned. Its a great book!
68998,Especially when taken in context with Asimov's robot/foundation novels.
68999,"I once got End of Eternity on a book sale, not knowing what it is. Boy, was I surprised. Great story and a wholly novel approach to time travel ideas!"
69000,"Surface Detail, Iain M. Banks; 
Altered Carbon, Richard Morgan;
Dune, Frank Herbert"
69001,"I was just thinking about which Iain M. Banks novel I’d pick.  Surface Detail, Use of Weapons, and Look to Windward are very different from each other in structure, tone, and theme, so it’s difficult to compare them with each other.  With a gun to my head, I’d probably go with Surface Detail too.  I love all of his sci-fi novels."
69002,"Stranger in a Strange Land & The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, by Robert A Heinlein and Flood by Stephen Baxter"
69003,Grok
69004,Stranger in a Strange Land is such a great book! I’d rather a religion had been created from this book instead of anything by L. Ron Hubbard’s work.
69005,I love Flood! The inevitability is gripping.
69006,"A Scanner Darkly by Philip K. Dyck

Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card"
69007,"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, The Sirens of Titan, Snow Crash

But my favorite author is Arthur C. Clarke."
69008,"A Fire Upon the Deep, Dune, Footfall"
69009,"AFUtD is a great example of what I love in SF - just read it again recently.  It's more of a direct adventure story but it's a lot of fun. So hard to pick ""top 3"" because it varies with my mood.

Among the top ones, today, and which list will be different tomorrow:

1. A Fire Upon the Deep (per above)
2. Enders Game (just holds up well as a re-read)
3. Cryptonomicon (which has the density I crave, even though it's often more historical than futuristic).

Though I'd be tempted to include Dune as well but didn't want to copy your list.  Anthologies won't make the cut of course even though Dangerous Visions deserves to be in there.  Pynchon is maybe too literary but Gravity's Rainbow deserves a mention."
69010,"I agree it's hard to pick 3, I could also easily throw Commonwealth Saga, Gateway, Hyperion,...."
69011,"As of right now:

Dune - Frank Herbert

Children of Time - Adrian Tchaikovsky

Seveneves - Neal Stephenson

Honorable mentions go to the Bobiverse series and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"
69012,I really enjoyed Children of Time. Read it back in May. Getting ready to start Children of Ruin after I finish my current book!
69013,"It's also great, but much different in tone. I loved them both, but the first has a special place in my heart. The ending of Ruin makes me excited for the sequel though."
69014,"Yes, moderns! I've read pretty much all the classic scifi and loved it at the time, but I think the stuff coming out now is even better. Granted, they wouldn't have been able to exist without influence from the classics. Swap out Dune with Ancillary Justice and I'm right there with you!"
69015,"Dune
Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers
The Book of the New Sun"
69016,"Anathem, Hyperion, Dune."
69017,"I'm a series guy so this will have to reflect that.

(1) **Dune Series** by Frank Herbert. (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune)

(2) **Hyperion Cantos** by Dan Simmons. (Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Rise of Endymion, Endymion)

(3) **The Sun Eater** by Christopher Ruocchio. HOPEFULLY, he will stick the landing. 3 out of 5 books are out and I am 75% done w/ the third. But they are... amazing. (Empire of Silence, Howling Dark, Demon in White).

If Sun Eater trips at the finish line, then I would replace it with the **Revelation Space** **Saga** by Alastair Reynolds. (Including the short stories of Galactic North, and the novels Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap. While The Prefect, Elysium Fire and Chasm City are top shelf material - the core series is unsurpassed in hard sci-fi.)"
69018,"Okay, I will also play by the rules.  Here are my top 3 **BOOKS.** While some are components in a larger series - for one reason or another the series falls flat. Examples of that are Rendezvous with Rama (great initial book, forgettable sequels), Enders Game (first book is 100% a different thing than the rest of the series), 

**Children of Time**

**Stranger from a Strange Land**

**Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy**

(Honorable Mentions: World War Z (seriously, people, pick this one up. It's amaze-balls.), Fahrenheit 451,  Player of Games, Flowers for Algernon)"
69019,"Dune - Frank Herbert
Neuromancer - William Gibson
Mara Chronicles - Ray Bradbury"
69020,I tried to read Neuromancer. God it's such a slog. The literature. It's so dense. I gave up just after some 10 pages.
69021,"It is a rather complex literature.
But, with me, it was a matter of getting used to the literary genre!"
69022,"*Snow Cras*h, by Neal Stephenson

*All Systems Red*, by Martha Wells

*Accelerando*, by Charles Stross"
69023,Snow Craah is pretty good.
69024,The Murderbot Diaries are fantastic!
69025,I keep seeing these get recs but I can't get over the name...it just sounds so cheesy.  But i haven't seen anyone pan them so I guess I should get over it.
69026,I'm glad you mentioned Jack McDevitt because I have really enjoyed his books and they don't seem to get much notice.
69027,I'll second that!
69028,"McDevitt picks ideas I love the idea of exploring, and while he has an easy, readable style, with decent characters,  the conclusions aren't always that satisfying. That said, Engines of God is fantastic."
69030,"1) Dune 
2) The Martian 
3) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
69031,"Ready Player One, Neuromancer, Ender's Game."
69032,"I'm going to have to have 2 lists, sorry.

You mentioned The Country Of The Blind by HG Wells. This is a story that I have never been able to finish.

69057,"1. The Book of the New Sun, Gene Wolfe

2. Gravity's Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon

3. The Dispossessed, Ursula LeGuin"
69058,You actually finished Gravity's Rainbow?
69059,"It's a mental commitment--took me about six-seven weeks with careful reading--but GR is hands down the most sublime, awesome, and impactful work of art/media I have engaged with. 

The reputation of being impossible is an overstatement: if you like WWII history, proto-cyberpunk (as Gibson declared it), occult magick, mad scientists, military industrial complex commentary, crazed nazis, telepaths, spies, mediums, hard science, paranoia, sixties counter culture, historical movements, mysticism, looney toons, philosophy, myth, Death, and so much more, then it's literally one of the coolest fucking artistic achievements in modern history and should keep you fully engaged.

I obsessed and still obsess over that book. r/thomaspynchon helped a lot as well. Pynchon really makes a fanboy out of you if you aren't coming from the literary side of things but rather the Philip K Dick etc world."
69060,"Dune, Footfall, Desolation Road"
69061,"Time Enough for Love.   
The Mote in God's Eye.

Enders Game by orson Scott 

And finally 

The lost fleet, beyond the frontier,
Leviathan...

By Jack campebell


My criterion was making it real so that I could live there. Its about being a soldier and its about being in space. See space. It doesn't work like gravity. It's.. different. And when you take that into account its a whole different kind of mode."

69085,"Agreed! I actually stopped reading TBP a few chapters in because it wasn't grabbing me, but I kept hearing how it good was, so I gave it another shot a few years later. Very glad I did (and if I had hung in there like 2-3 more chapters the first time it would have hooked me). But TDF for me is the book where the whole series really becomes something special."

69105,"I’ve read and enjoyed many of the previous (and hand out Snow Crash to folks who like SFF but don’t know Stephenson), but here are 3 others that I’ve enjoyed as fun - and sometimes thoughtful - reads:

(1) Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon, by Spider Robinson (especially The Time Traveler’s Lament, which I think is the 2nd story in the book)
(2) Dream Park, by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes
(3) the Circuit series, by Melinda Snodgrass - jurisprudence in space! Unfortunately out of print but possibly available at a Half-Price Books near you.

Other honorable mentions: 
* David Weber’s Honor Harrington series (On Basilisk Station was mentioned above - it’s the first book of what I think is a series of 18+ novels, some of which are better than others; if you’re not familiar with it, think “Horatio Hornblower in space”)
* Flatlander by Larry Niven - its subtitle is “the collected stories of Gil ‘the arm’ Hamilton”, and it’s a series of locked-room mysteries which I remember enjoying (but admittedly it’s been quite a while since I read them...)

Thank you to the OP - I love seeing threads like this that suggest new things to check out!"

69144,"For employ-ability, engineering. Licensed engineers can work as engineers, public works professionals, consultants, computer tech, etc. Even if you don't work in a profession that requires a licensed engineer, a lot of the skills are transferable to other trades and people generally assume you are smart enough to learn a new job. If you are willing to move, it is hard to not find a job as an engineer.

However, I think business is the most useful. While it doesn't make you extremely employable, the skills you learn in management, accounting, and finance are used in almost every profession. You can be the best engineer, doctor, lawyer, architect, software developer, etc., but if you can run a business or make yours more profitable then you will not go far professionally."

Although I couldn't imagine doing a medical job unless you are both highly intelligent and feel like it's your calling."
69146,"In high school everyone started saying they wanted to become anesthesiologists because of how much they make. 

Even though not one of them would be near intelligent enough to do it,  it made me angry because they didn't stop and think how terrifyingly important it is to be good at that particular job. I mean, if you're going to work at it and become educated, please do. But if you're standing in front of me talking about the bank you'll make instead of putting the actual  task in perspective, my jimmies are going to be rustled. That's a delicate job."
69147,"Totally true, anyway life is too short to just get into a field because you want the money. On the other hand if you don't care one way or the other, you might as well get into some high-paying career.

Money can also sometimes be a proxy for importance. Anesthesiologists getting a high pay probably means they are needing more of them.

Thinking positively a bit more, it could be that by the time you are going through medical school, you'll be totally carried by your motivation for the task at hand. It'll be the details of study that finally settle if you were truly meant for it."
69148,Computer Science or Engineering. Best majors to get a job with.
69149,"If you want an undergraduate that results in a job, computer science or some form of engineering. If you want an undergraduate that supplements another employable skillset, business. If you want an undergraduate that you can use to go into graduate school relatively easily, some social science or art program (I don't care what you say, GPAs in those degrees are typically higher and for some reason count towards graduate entrance as much as a more difficult degree.)

Despite having a couple of degrees I'm not a huge proponent of typical university degrees now that I'm in the work force. I was the first person in my family to ever go to post-secondary so my parents just assumed that university was the ticket to a good life and in reality I'm not so sure it is for everyone.

I kinda just want to be a carpenter."
69150,"I worked IT for years, but I lost my job and had to take a ""temporary"" position changing oil at a local dealership. I had never worked on cars before and it turns out I really like it. I am far less stressed when I get home. My physical fitness improved greatly, and I have learned a whole new skill set.  I say go for it. You can always go back to what you do now."
69151,"The most useful college major is the one that fits best for the person. Not everyone will be, nor should be, a STEM major. For some people STEM is the best, for others, it is English, or Literature, others yet is Music, Theater, Communications, Art. 

The thing is... a college major is not an end point. It is not ""The Decision"" that will affect you forever."
69152,"Mostly true I think. I go to an engineering and science driven school. Many of my friends are in these majors and are very good at it. I on the other hand am so terrible at math and have always longed for a creative career. I will be graduating with a graphic design degree. I wish my brain was good at math. But this is definitely better suited for me. You shouldn't just follow the money because not everyone can be good being a doctor or engineer.

Although you still gotta look at what you can make a living off of and be realistic.
In my case a graphic design degree is much better option than a integrated studio arts degree of painting, ceramics, sculpture etc.)
Thank God I love it too :)"
69153,"I'm gonna have to disagree.  There should be some element of ""follow your dreams,"" but you also have to be realistic.  Not everyone should be a STEM major, but you also shouldn't pick majoring in theater, because you'll just end up with a lot of debt and underemployed.  There needs to be some sort of balance.  A job doesn't have to be your dream job and doesn't have to pay six figures straight out of school.  It should be something that you like and can make a living off of."
69154,I'll tell you what it isn't.  Women's studies.
69155,Sup
69156,I'll tell you what the most useless major is.... film. Don't end up like me; speak to smart people not to counselors.
70403,Engineering
69158,My parents always tell me engineering would be helpful for any kind of job. Cause you're good at math and all that stuff
69159,"I don't know that there's one most useful major, but I would say computer science is pretty useful.  You can do IT, development, or you can even do your own start up if you're good enough.  The skills learned with a CS degree won't be going away any time soon."
69160,Someone please say geology...
69162,"There are many jobs in that field, which many people don't realize."
69163,Geology is huge in many industries. With the amount of coal mining and fracking going on I imagine geologists are in high demand.
69165,Business major.
69166,Computer engineering
69167,Geo engineer's have an extremely high job rate right now.
69168,"Not to sound like the reddit stereotype, but some kind STEM is usually more feasible than other majors. Not to say that *no one* should pursue liberal arts, but I would say it's less ""useful""."
69169,"I think that the thing with many liberal arts degrees is that you should only pursue that if you're really serious about it. If you have a true passion and an unusual aptitude, and you want to get a PhD, work in academia, and devote your life to Women's Studies or Chinese literature, by all means pursue it. But if this is not your plan, you might have a hard time with a BA in Women's Studies. For the hypothetical Women's Studies major, a more practical alternative could be, for example, to take Women's Studies as a minor or even a double major with Psychology or Social Work, and use your understanding of women's issues to do something like work with domestic abuse victims or rape victims. It's a practical, actionable career plan, beyond just finding the subject interesting, but having no clue how you're going to apply it careerwise."
69170,"The one that suits your talents and desires. Smart people can get jobs and build careers doing whatever they can make, sell, or promote."
69171,I know that the least useful major is Creative Nonfiction
69172,"Honestly depends on what you consider useful - useful to society, employability, long term salary?

Medicine is probably one of the best in terms of all 3 of those factors.

Law, Engineering and Finance too depending on your world view."
69173,"In today's economy, Underwater Basket Weaving, or UBW, is a very important and highly regarded major. I have a friend who works in the business and he makes over $20 million a year."
69174,English. It is known that employers will hire someone if they either double majored or minored in English. They want to make sure that their employees can speak and write the correct way.
69175,oof.... last sentence. :/
69176,Anything in STEM.
69177,Good luck getting a decent job with a BS in the natural sciences.
69178,"Depends on if you mean for society as a whole or for the individual.

For society it'd probably be a STEM field, business, economics, medicine, and anything else that can provide a large measurable benefit to the person as well as the world at large.

For the individual it would be anything that can give the individual a future where they can be successful while also enjoying what it is that they do. If Art History is their only passion, then Art History is the only choice that makes sense. I've seen way too many people get degrees that they hated and enter into jobs that they hated even more. It really boils down to:

(Marginal increase in income due to getting degree) x (Marginal increase in happiness due to working in that field)"
69179,"Anyone that teaches a trade. 

I knew a guy who wanted to major in Ancient Linguistics. C'mon now. Or Philosophy. How many philosophy jobs are there?"
69180,"Philosophy major is not for finding a job. It's for those who wish to pursue college after a bachelors degree. You can go off to get a PhD and become a professor, or you can go to law school. Philsophy majors do really well in law school."
69181,"Right, like I said, Philosophy doesn't help you get a job at all."
69182,/r/JustStemThings
69183,I have no idea what that subreddit is but I think it made me retarded.
69184,Yeah it's a pretty shitty circlejerk. I'm honestly not entirely sure whether they're serious or not.
69185,"Something finance, business, or sales related"
69186,"Did accounting, would probably go back and do engineering, which was my second choice. My salary is good and my ceiling is probably higher than many engineering roles, but engineering just seems more interesting."
69187,"Same.  Exact.  Boat.  Studied accounting.  Went into investment banking, but don't see longevity from a happiness perspective.  Feel that engineering would have given me the happiness longevity."
69188,How'd you break into IB? Feel free to PM me. I'm not really interested in IB but it's always nice to know different paths people take.
69189,"College internships.  I did not go to a front office target school, but I had my first back office internship summer after sophomore year.  Made friends with the front office guys and then got an internship for the next summer where I received a full time offer afterwards.  Started in 2008 in a generalist banking roll but move to capital markets in 2010."
69190,"I mean, it depends. Engineers get to the C-level too."
69191,"Sure, I'm generalizing but I think it's a pretty accepted thing that engineering starts high but tends to level out sooner."
69192,"Levels out on the technical side; if you switch to management, it's not much different from a nontechnical career path after. 

I won't, because I like technical and can FI on that path."
69194,"Can confirm. My FIL was an engineer, got his MBA paid for by a company at a mid level state school. Was the CEO of a small cap public company for ~3 years and just transitioned to a private company as their CEO to bring them public."
69195,"Engineer here, I'm pretty sure I'm poorer and more interesting than you."
69196,"Did an engineer just say he was interesting?
(Source: am economics.  I know boring.)"
69197,"I know you were kidding, but my accounting friends and I always joked about how off-base the ""awkward/shy/bland"" accountant stereotype was amongst us. Granted we were going into/are in public accounting, which is a little different than your typical ""Debbie in Accounting"" type, but still. I actually worked in the machine lab on campus as a bookkeeper and I was always shocked at how about half the engineering kids that came in couldnt form a sentence or speak like a human in any way."
69198,"You won't get an argument from me defending engineers as exceedingly social. My dad is a CPA, he's pretty bland, just like me :)"
69199,"Nope.  

Art major here, and from that you might think I'm hardly getting by.  It's true, stats don't paint a rosy picture, but a lot of your success depends on other things than *just* your major.  I focused on graphic design.  During college, I was building websites.  After college, I hustled, made connections, and worked freelance outside of my 9-5.

Now I'm heading up a team of designers, and making a very decent six-figure salary.  My head was never in the CS/engineering space, so I'm 100% happy with my choice of major."
69200,"Good for you. I have a BA in Theatre and an MFA in Playwrighting. 

And I RE'd at 49 after having a very solid career in high tech, ending as a VP of operations and marketing.

And now I'm writing full time again. 

I wouldn't change anything."
69201,That's what I'm talkin' bout
69202,Was it hard to transition to CS since you were mostly into art? I studied mostly medical/science in school and was thinking of going through the front-end web development route.
69203,"Well, I'm not an engineer.  I consider myself, first and foremost, a designer.  Which means I'm concerned with visuals, user experience, usability, customer research, etc.

I work really closely with a lot of front end devs, and do occasionally help them out when it comes to writing CSS, but it's not a core part of my job by any means.  I'd describe it as a job-applicable hobby.

That said, I'd recommend you give it a shot.  I know someone who went through MCDB in school, thought she was set for a life of working in labs and publishing papers, and then discovered coding.  She's a front end developer now.

Start simple: Codecademy, or Treehouse.  See if it suits you before committing yourself to it fully."
69205,"Majored in Accounting, worked a bit, and then went and got a masters in a specific field of I.E. (Supply Chain Engineering). 

Accounting/Finance + Supply Chain skills landed me a $180k job at 30. 

No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune)."
69206,180k?  that must be senior management though.
69207,Director-level business development
69208,How about a Supply Chain/Finance double major? With a minor in accounting
69209,"It depends what job you want.

When people double major it's often because they can't decide between two things and don't want to close doors down the line but a double major won't always help you unless you know specifically what you want."
69210,"> No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune).

Having seen enough people around me being quite successful (and others, failing pretty badly), I have come to the conclusion that blaming it on luck and timing is often a gross oversimplification.

Some people keep making smart choices, take risks, and always find new challenges, and eventually one of these risks works out and they ""get lucky"". Others always play it safe and do what conventional wisdom requires, and not surprisingly, ""luck"" never finds them.

There never is a guarantee that any particular gamble is going to work out. But unless you give ""luck"" a chance, it doesn't matter how much you keep talking about luck and good timing; it'll never be you. 

I used to dismiss the achievements of people who simply got luck; these days, I feel that if luck is given as the reason, then we probably haven't heard the full story."
69211,"This is an intriguing topic. I find that many people are practically blind to the effects of chance on their own lives, in particular, with regard to their own success. You are obviously right about some of the ways that people can improve their odds of doing well (or at least expand the range of possible outcomes). 

But one interesting quirk is that the magnitude of the resulting success is often wildly dependent on 'luck.' You might think of this is as the luck of the luck.

The billionaire, the 10 millionaire, and the guy who earns $300k a year from his small company might have engaged in an identical level of the kind of actions that you have described (good choices, risk taking, bucking conventional wisdom, making their own luck, etc.) Perhaps the guy with the small company is the boldest, most inventive, and cleverest of the three. It is unlikely that the billionaire was a few thousand times 'better' than the last guy. It's more likely that he was a few thousand times luckier. 

Some people see this analysis as so obvious as to be not worth discussing, but others are deeply offended by it.

So I agree, 'luck' is an oversimplification, but not wrong. In the end I think that, over a certain threshold, the effects of luck dwarf the effects of behavior because of the asymmetrical upside."
69212,"Well said.

I would be remiss to say that my success have been 100% luck.

Moved to 5 different cities in 5 years, taking on ever more challenging roles. 

However, a lot of it was being in the ""right place and the right time for sure. 

I simply worked very hard to do my part to be prepared, ready, and able when opportunities presented themselves."
69213,I've always wanted to do something more on the operational side than just back office stuff. What kind of job do you do?
69215,"Curious, would you say you could break into supply chain work (with growth opportunity) without the masters? I'm a CPA currently working for a Big 4 firm doing audit, and I'm strongly considering trying to break into more operational roles when I'm done here (probably in a year or so)."
69216,"I studied chemistry, as there wasn't a good CS program available (at the time, and in my country). I never planned on working in that field and never did. School taught me how to study. But it didn't teach me any of the subjects I really needed. That's all on my own time. In many ways, I feel I succeeded despite and not because of my schools best efforts.

In hindsight, the obvious choice would have been either to study abroad where there were good CS programs, or to go to a school that allows you to ""build your own major"". That's what my brother did a few years later, and he is quite happy with how that worked out.

Having said that, the outcome probably would have been similar in either case. It's just that the alternatives might have been easier than what I did. But then, being easier isn't necessarily better when making important life decisions and learning important skills (both soft and hard skills).

Pretty much the only thing that mattered for me was picking a STEM major. And my career after school definitely proved that in the end I made absolutely the right choices."
69217,"I occasionally think getting a degree in History was useless.  But I'm making $72k for a 181 contracted days.  I'd like to think I'd go into finance, though, and have considered getting an MBA."
69218,College prof? In history?
69219,"Spanish teacher, high school."
69220,Where do you teach? I make about half that.
69221,Northern California in the Sacramento valley.
69222,My money says this persons in the Northeast or Bay Area
69223,"Nope. Inland. Northern California in the Sacramento valley.

Care to pay up?"
69224,"Seriously, I almost typed Northern California, but St. the last second specified Bay Area. Should have gone with my gut.

I've lived out there. Maybe Sacramento Valley is different, but most people on this sub probably think you're rolling in it at $72k a year. 

But NorCal people know the struggle of $4.50/gal gas and milk."
69225,this depends. I live in the bay and today paid $2.30 for gas. don't buy milk often so can't compare.
69226,"The struggle is real! But, gas is hovering around 2.20 around now.

Really I should be making between $55-59k, but the MA gives me a small stipend.  More importantly I teach an extra class for a 16% pay bump and a summer school course."
69227,"I think I'd do nursing instead. I have a degree in English I probably will never use, and I've learnt that I'm more of a hands-on person than really academic anyway."
69228,I graduated with a BA in History and a minor in Anthropology. I'm now starting nursing school because of how hard it is to find (and keep) a teaching job in my part of New York.
69230,"I would've liked to do a diabetes nursing specialism. Unfortunately you can't get a state loan for a second degree in the UK and the fees are now over £9000 per year. The avg wage for a nurse on the NHS is about £22k pa. If I could go back and do it at £3k fees I would.

Edit: Just had a look - looks like the NHS might pay the fees... this needs some serious thought."
69231,"Majored in chemical engineering.

Kid Toasty always wanted to make video games. I think I'd go back for computer science/art double major. People say, ""If you love video games, don't get a job making them."" Adult Toasty isn't finding that same spark when playing video games but the idea of making imagination into reality is still there."
69232,"I'm probably the opposite of everyone here, but I got my degree in CS (my M.S. in fact), but I hate software development. Yes, you get paid a lot, but it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything real or anything that matters. If I could do it over again, I might do a degree in another science, like biology, and do medical research."
69233,I work for a medical research university. The salary level for research associates below the PhD level are straight abysmal. I'm talking less than 60k for maybe near a decade of experience. You did well avoiding that path.
69234,"Yep. I'm a chemist (Bachelors) with 8 years of experience. I barely make 62K gross. I probably take home about 33K after being robbed at gunpoint by the government. 

I wouldn't go that route. Once my spouse is done with his masters, I hope I'll be able to go back to school."
69235,How are your taxes that high at that salary level?
69237,I know a Biology PhD with publications in Nature that was getting $30k-$35k from an Ivy league school for a post doc because he couldn't find a tenured faculty gig. It's brutal.
69239,"If you feel this way, you should start some personal projects or find another job.  All industries need CS.  

As an example for biomedical - in the next decade all or most of the medical equipment is going to be replaced by smart tech that detects symptoms via classification algorithms. 

If you are doing computer science right, you will arguably contribute more to the world than any other industry."
69240,"Sounds like you might be in the wrong domain then. I could see pushing ads or optimizing clicks feeling unfulfilling, but there are plenty of jobs in medical/education sectors that might be different.

I'm in medical software, and it does give that extra benefit of spending your time developing features/talking about things that will help people at the end of the day."
69241,I'm in the same boat. I'm doing CS now but it's terribly boring to me. I would probably do engineering.
69242,"I have a dual-degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering. If I went back, I'd probably just get the aero degree. I would then have time a few more aero classes, which were the ones I enjoyed most. Maybe one day I'll go back for a masters.."
69243,"It's my understanding there isn't a huge difference between the two degrees. I know one of my friends that did Aerospace had an interview where the interviewer asked a bunch of thermodynamics questions and then finished with ""do you ever regret not going into Mechanical?""

I guess he got the last laugh, he's working for JPL."
69244,"If I could do it over, I'd have gone to school for architecture. I think to think after the Brady Bunch was cancelled, I'm Mr. Brady's reincarnation. 

Once I hit RE, I could design my own log cabin and move out of the city."
69246,"You're killing me smalls! That sounds awesome. 

Are you commercial or residential?"
69247,"Mostly commercial.

There's a joke amongst architects that practicing  residential architecture is more akin to marriage counseling than architecture.

Does it help dissuade you somewhat that I still regularly work 55-70 hours a week and when I started out, I made $26k a year?"
69248,What are your thoughts on the one person architecture firm?  Obviously you'd be restricted to small projects.  I've seen some of the contracts for houses and small restaurants and if one or two people could do one or two projects a year it seems like that could be viable.
69250,Interesting.  That's about what I thought.  I'm a subcontractor in fire protection and can attest to the bullshit and change orders that happen down the line because of an incomplete design.  I swear dealing with that and arguing about it is half my job.  I also happen to be friends with several architects that want to break out of corporate to do it on their own.

69252,"My degree was in psychology, and I wouldn't change it for the world even though my current career is far from psychology.  I spent four years learning how people work, I enjoyed the classes, and now I leverage that knowledge.  Just look up anchoring in salary negotiations as an example.  My opinion: the key is to learn something you're interested in, then figure out how to apply it."
69253,"I've loved psychology/neuroscience since HS, and after 4 tumultuous years in college, just recently changed my major to psych at my new school. I've always had this fear that, wanting to enter into the medical field, a psych degree would be laughed at. and that job prospects would be poor. no idea why. but it's truly one of my few passions and this post makes me feel better about finally deciding to major in it"
69254,What is your occupation? Just curious as a psych grad looking for a job.
69255,"I work in business intelligence and analytics now.  It was a wild ride, though.  I started out working in a greenhouse, and was promoted to manager there.  Moved from managing that to a movie theater.  Once I learned something about financials, I went to work for a college as a financial aid counselor.  Plan was to get a higher degree, but I started helping out a coworker that did our IT and report writing.  He taught me about writing reports in a few different technology stacks.  He got a promotion, and pulled me into his department to work with him full time on reporting.  I moved again after a couple of years to work for a major university's fundraising branch and ran a team there.  Now I'm building a business intelligence department from the ground up for a healthcare company.

All to say- Get a job, any job, then network, remember how people work, and forge your own path.  Accepting a job does not force you into that company for any longer than you want it to.  You only owe an employer what time they've paid you for.  Once you find a chance to move up, grab it."
69256,"I would want to pick something that is a little less location dependent.  I have a degree in engineering, and thus my job prospects are *mostly* tied to major cities, though engineers are needed just about everywhere (to some extent) due to utilities and such.  TBH, I don't like the congestion and fast pace of large cities.  I want a slower, simpler pace of life.

The flipside to this is that working remotely is at least feasible for my type of work, it's just that employers in my field seem very few and far between.

One of my biggest drivers for attaining FI is to be able to live where I want irrespective of employment opportunities.  I don't want to be shut out of moving somewhere because ""there are no good paying jobs here.""  It seems that high pay is tied to big, congested cities.  Smaller cities obviously have fewer jobs overall due to lower population, but it seems that they often lack high-paying jobs as well.  As much as being financially independent would open things up for me, even not being tied to big cities would be a good stepping stone for me.  Finding remote work would be a huge improvement in my life.

Careers that at least seem like they would be location independent, because they are needed everywhere: medicine, emergency services, education, skilled trades.  If I could do it all over, being a medical doctor in a small/medium sized city would have probably made me very happy."
69257,M.E. here. Got into technical sales and manage a sales tram across the Americas. Fully location agnostic. It is all in how you slice it.
69258,"In my senior year, currently finance major, would have done accounting or double majored fin/acc if I had to start over today.

Finance is something that has 3 distinct types of work, 1. securities, 2. corp fin. 3. transaction services Ie Banking. Unless you're doing securities an accounting degree supplemented with your own outside resources is much better, especially if you want to go high finance."
69259,"Ah, i see. How about a double finance and supply chain? I'm not too and nothing is set in stone but i would like to set my self up for success. And maybe someone looking into business-law?"
69260,"I agree with /u/HarbisonCarnegie. I just graduated with a degree in finance from a highly ranked school and still, more accounting courses would have been the ideal supplement. In hindsight, there are a few problems with studying finance. 

Finance is largely a soft skill in the sense that it gives you an understanding of market participants, investment strategies and financial concepts. This is fine and all but when you graduate, you'll want hard, marketable skills, ie accounting.

Second, finance is a somewhat saturated field. It's more glamorous than accounting and attracts more students. Unfortunately, there is much stronger demand for accountants than financial analysts. In my opinion, by adding an accounting concentration/minor, you'll be setting yourself up for success.

I'm not too familiar with supply chain management although I've heard that it's a growing, in demand field. Law is a SUPER saturated field."
69261,"Thank you so much for the info and advice, i'll be sure to look into both finance and accounting. As for law, that'll have to wait but its definitely in the back of my mind. One more thing, school wise, it also matter where you attend if not for undergrad but for grad school due to networking/employers seeking for graduates from specific schools. Any info on that?"
69262,"Your major is a much bigger factor in your salary/employability after graduation. If you decide to go to graduate school then the prestige of your undergraduate school is unimportant. On the other hand, if you were hypothetically determined to become a banker out of undergrad, then your undergrad school would be important. It's the same way for most top jobs/companies.

My two recommendations would be to first add some hard skills to your curriculum (whatever those skills may be). Second, only apply to an MBA program after having management experience (might sound counter-intuitive, but employers like concrete evidence you're an effective manager)."
69263,"Could be good if you're looking into the procurement side of SCM, again I'd recommend degrees that teach specific skills in undergrad, such as ACC or Engineering. All of this is highly dependent on GPA, your school and networking."
69264,High finance cares more about school than degree. Accounting isn't going to get you into banking. Finance is crap shoot unless you are at a target.
69265,Agreed 3.3 gpa art majors at Harvard have a better chance than state school 4.0 finance majors.
69266,"You know, if you think it will translate into significantly better earnings or a better career, it might be worth considering adding on a major and sticking around for another year or two."
69267,"yeah, but I have a return offer to a large bank which is where 
I would most likely end up if I added accounting, so it doesn't make financial sense for me at the moment"
69268,"Yeah, finance seems like a place where you either go to a top school and do IB, bust your ass for securities, or burn out in corp. fin.

You can always try recruiting FSO for a large accounting/services firm.  That or double-major now and get your CPA in a year, not too late for that."
69269,"> transaction services Ie Banking

TS is not banking. Some banks say ""corporate finance"" instead of ""banking"", but I've only ever heard TS used in accounting. The Big4 banking groups are also called ""corporate finance"" and not ""transaction services"".

Caveat: I work in trading and not banking so it's possible that this is incorrect."
69270,"Transaction services is a broad term for financial services where you receive money in exchange for performing a service. one example is due diligence on companies for M&A or underwriting offerings, in exchange for your service you'd receive a one time fee. This is what i'm referring to when I talk about the transaction services or the transaction side of finance"
69271,"My degree is in economics. I would look into computer science. High paying jobs, almost guaranteed work, incredible benefits and the ability to be super creative if you want."
69272,I think reddit paints a rosier picture than is representative of the industry though
69273,Every CS major I know irl says the job pays great but is boring/tedious af.  Some of them get mental projects on short timelines too.
69274,"Perhaps, but I'm writing this from experience in both sectors. I haven't checked it out on reddit."
69275,"My degree is in physics and math, and I work in software now. If I could do it again I'd study computer science, no question!"
69276,">  the ability to be super creative if you want.

Wat? You get creative on your own time."
69278,"I studied French in university and am now working in development. If I could go back I'd probably do Political Science. I was actually a double major for it, but dropped it because the intro classes were boring. I didn't have the patience to get to the more interesting, skill bearing classes later on. 

That being said I don't really regret French in any way. I studied what I loved, I kicked ass at it, and it's opened up a lot of really interesting opportunities since."
69279,Funny how we end up in careers that may not be directly related to what we studied.
69280,What does political science offer?
69281,"For my current work I'm helping influence and formulate public policy for education systems in developing countries. My university had courses on public policy and international relations that taught how to write various policies. It likely wasn't geared towards what I'm doing now, but some experience works better than the none I'm dealing with now. I can't say having an extensive knowledge of French literature is helping me now. Though I am lucky to have done my capstone on their colonial influences."
