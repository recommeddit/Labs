It's amazing"
28481,"Take all the ingredients for your favorite omelette, throw them into a blender and chop it all up. Then portion them out in a muffin tin or two. Bake them and store in tupperware and you have breakfast for the rest of the week!"
28482,"note, remove shell from eggs before blending."
28483,"My coffee is made in a French press so I boil a little extra water for oatmeal.

Once a week I prep my own oatmeal mix: instant oats, powdered milk, raisins, cinnamon, powdered vanilla, a pinch of salt, and a little sugar. Seal into a quart mason jar and shake--3 minutes for 7 days.

The homemade instant oatmeal started out as something I do for medical reasons, but it turns out to be both cheaper and better than the store bought packets: food manufacturers use fillers such as guar gum--a thickener with no nutritional value--so you don't realize you're getting shorted on the oats."
28484,"I do something similar, but I just use oats, chia&hemp seeds, and some protein powder (vega one). Sometimes add raisins for a treat"
28485,">Sometimes add raisins for a treat


What a sad, sad life."
28486,Can you share you recipe for this?
28487,"It isn't an exact recipe but here goes.

Start with a one quart mason jar. Use canning funnel kind of like this.

http://www.countryhomecanning.com/images/x2009_0327CanningImage0056-resized.jpg.pagespeed.ic.x0ytKaBt9T.jpg

Then add instant oats about halfway, dry milk to the 2/3 mark, a dash of sugar, and then a bunch of raisins--leave about 10% space at the top. Lastly add cinnamon and dry vanilla powder to taste plus a pinch of salt.

Then cap and shake until it's well mixed. Store on a shelf and shake out a little into a bowl each day at breakfast. Add boiling water. By the time a coffee press is ready the oatmeal is also ready to eat. One batch lasts me 7 days."
28488,I've never heard of dry vanilla powder - off to Amazon!
28489,English muffin with a scrambled egg/ham. Basically a home made egg mcmuffin that wont give you diarrhea. Super quick to make. Throw cheese on it too.
28490,"If an egg mcmuffin from McDonalds gives you diarrhea then you're either lactose intolerant or have a weak stomach.   

It's just an egg, american cheese, and a tiny slice of ham."
28491,Right? It's what you'd get if you made it at home. Why pretend just because it's fast food you'll automatically get sick?
28492,"I used to take an English Muffin, toast, take an egg, put in the bottom of a m/w safe cup (pierce the yolk), cook 1 minute. Put egg on Muffin, add slice cheese, slice or piece of some meat product...Poor mans Egg McMuffin."
28493,The egg mcmuffin is the poor man's egg mcmuffin
28494,"Sometimes I pre-make a ton of breakfast burritos. Scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, bacon, sausage, cheese, even potatoes - just depends what I have in the house. Put in tortillas, wrap in paper towel, wrap in tinfoil. Stick in the freezer. Then every morning microwave for a minute or so and boom. Delicious breakfast burrito. Also take the tinfoil off first lol"
28495,"I have an egg steamer that makes boiled eggs. I load about half a dozen eggs in it, and hit the shower. 18 minutes later, I'm out of the shower and the eggs are done. Quick trip through the ice bath followed by two minutes to peel. I do that while microwaving some bacon, and my son and I have a tasty breakfast."
28496,Why not just shower in boiling water then you could take the eggs into the shower with you and save both time and energy?
28497,Because lobster red just isn't my color.
28498,"[That's a good, American answer.](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/lobsterback)"
28499,You could stick that bacon in the oven and it will be tastier.
28500,Oven bacon changed my life. It's just so much easier and tastier
28501,"> followed by two minutes to peel

What's your trick?

I swear I've tried everything (and I've tried in different countries, too, in case American eggs are weird) but I can never peel an egg I've boiled in anything short of a minute apiece, with lots of shards and flakes and general annoyance.

Meanwhile, boiled eggs in hotels always peel flawlessly."
28502,"The steamed eggs seem to peel much easier than regular boiled ones, especially if you shock them in really cold water. I roll them at the bottom of the ice water bowl firmly to crack the shells all around and peel them underwater. Sometimes there's a tough one but generally it slides right off."
28503,"> (and I've tried in different countries, too, in case American eggs are weird)

What is the nature of your trip today?
Trying to peel these fucking eggs, man. Uh. Pleasure?"
28504,"I found the fresher the egg, the harder it is to peel."
28505,add a little bit of vinegar to the water.
28506,"There's an air bubble inside the egg at the top or bottom.  Wack the egg gently on the counter to crack the top- you can do both sides if you want.  When you find the air bubble, start peeling the egg under cool water coming from a faucet."

28510,Every morning to help him get large.
28511,"I keep a bunch of chopped, mostly cooked bacon in the fridge. In the morning I mix a bit in with some eggs, scramble them together & wrap them in a tortilla like a burrito. 

I eat it in the car on the way to work with a cup of OJ & then get a cup of coffee when I get to the office."
28512,I make burritos too! But I make hash browns and chop up bacon in the raw egg mix then pour it into the pan when the hash browns are crispy and scramble everything together and put it in a wrap.
28513,"If you beat eggs into a muffin tray and add cheese, peppers, onions, bacon, or really anything you want, you can bake it and have nutritious meals for almost two weeks"
28514,"Dude, eat what you want, makes you happy, makes you physically feel good. 

My recent daily routine is make a pot of coffee, cook breakfast sausage and scramble three eggs.

28515,Are you doing keto?
28516,"Yup. No bread, pasta, beer, sugar, etc. I have lots of natural fats and dark leafy greens worked into it as well. Drink a TON of water and make sure you keep your electrolytes worked into your diet as well."

Throw in some bacon (I prefer turkey bacon, but I won't judge).

Whip up two eggs in a bowl with some salt and pepper.

Pour that into the pan.

Walk away for a bit.

Come back and flip it. (If you screw up, then you just might as well scramble it all).

Walk away again.

Come back and it's done.

I've been making this almost every morning since my time at university. You can add boadt or whatever. Mix it up with some different leftover meat from dinner the night before once in a while. It's good, simple, and once you got the timing down, you can kind of just walk away from it and do other morning stuff while it cooks."
28523,"> I prefer turkey bacon, but I won't judge

We will judge you though"
28524,Well now I'm judging you right back.
28525,Stop it stop it! Can't we all just get along?

28527,Surprised waffles isn't in this breakfast.
28528,"Would be great, but way too much effort and time."
28529,"Enhanced Oatmeal. Make it with milk instead of water, and add a beaten egg before you cook it. Bam! You just added 14 grams of protein, not to mention calcium and vitamin D, and a bunch of flavor. It's quick, convenient, hearty, and healthy. Don't worry about the fat from the milk either, it's *good* fat, and you're body needs it."
28530,"If you have a local donut shop, stop there on the way to work. These donuts are almost always superior to any store bought ones, even the ""fresh"" ones in a kroger bakery.

for a nice crust you can add a bit of sugar to the top so it caramelises the bananas aswell.  
loaf will last 5 days covered."
28532,"Overnight oats. I don't like the taste of oatmeal after it's been cooked. I normally have to drown it in milk, butter, and sugar to make it palatable, which defeats the purpose of eating oatmeal. Overnight oats are made the night before and are eaten cold. Old Fashioned oats, almond milk, greek yogurt, chia seeds, fruit, and a sweetener. It comes out to about 300 calories, it's thick, and the oats are raw and taste better that way. You just pull it from the fridge, no cooking required."

28539,I've heard of this before. I don't understand what the point of blending it does though. Does it taste good? Or like buttery coffee? So many questions
28540,Blending it makes it taste great like a foamy latte. People put cream in their coffee butter isn't much different from cream at the end of the day. Use high quality butter like Kerry gold.

28576,"I'm American but I've been living in Germany for a year and have spent a lot of time staying with German families. 

German breakfast is the best. In my experience, a big basket of rolls and bread will be set on the table. Then an assortment of various delicious items—cheese, cold cuts, sausage, jam, Nutella, cream cheese, etc.,—are on the table as well. You grab a roll or two, butter them up, and put whatever ingredients you want on your various pieces of bread. 

It's great because it gives you a bunch of delicious options, plus it's not hard at all to set up or clean up. You just bring out the ingredients in their containers, and then when you're done you put them back in the fridge. No pots and pans to clean up, just the plates."
28577,"Also hardboiled eggs, sliced peppers, tomatoes, fruit, unfiltered honey.  German breakfasts were the best."
28578,"Wow. As a german, this really made me re-think our typical breakfast. I usually find it boring, but the way you described it makes it sound pretty awesome actually.

Fuck it, I'll have some good ol' german breakfast. Now. At 6 PM."
28579,"Honestly all you Europeans have this food thing figured out. I just spent 2 weeks in Slovenia, back in may, and I have never been so satisfied eating."

28581,"You lucked out! When I was staying with my host family, she asked us the first night how we felt about toast. ""Fuck yeah, toast!"" said the college students.

She was very literal, Toast with butter and jam every morning with coffee and juice or Schorle.

6 weeks later, fuck toast."
28582,"Oh man, the best breakfast I ever had was in Austria and Germany - they had a spread of [kaiser rolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_roll), cream cheese, ham, cheese, and jam. They also had plain yogurt, which I flavored with jam. It was magnificent."

If god loves you (let's be fair if god loved you you wouldn't be awake in time for breakfast) you get a big piece of fish, or two pieces of fish. Three pieces of fish.

Or at least, this is the basic menu at a hotel or something. I think most people only eat breakfast if their wife or mother makes it for them.

So yeah, cup of coffee and a cigarette probably.

Eggs are somewhere between $1 and $3 per dozen, contain 90 calories per egg and cost 8 cents each. 

So a three egg omelette every morning worth 270 calories would cost 24 cents plus a nominal amount for fat to fry it in, or about half of what a poptart costs.

When I was living there, we'd have fresh simit (sesame-covered crusty hoop-shaped bread) hoisted up to our apartment brought to us by the kid from the bakery down the street, sour cherry and/or strawberry preserves, beyaz peynir (delicious salty white feta-ish cheese), kasar cheese (a less crumbly cheese - I think it's called Kashkaval elsewhere?), honey, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, spicy fried sausages, peppers, and lots of lovely tea. Last time I went to Istanbul I found a place that specializes in Anatolian-style breakfasts and went with a friend - I'm pretty sure their kaymak and honey (kind of like clotted cream but thicker and smoother at the same time) should be classified as a controlled substance. I've also had menemen for breakfast (kind of like an omelet, but less solid and a lot spicier - much like migas without the tortillas) and it's delicious, but I prefer it for lunch.

Every morning I'd down my body weight in delicious tea, have a couple of hard boiled eggs and all that standard breakfast fare you mentioned. I was particularly fond of the peynir and luckily found a store in Minneapolis that sells it! They sell  Tamek juice too, so I can have şeftali nektarı WHENEVER I WANT! It was my FAVORITE!

But honestly though. Let's talk about Turkish food in general AMIRITE?! Manti, lahmacun, bulgur, gooooooooooooooood I put on like ten pounds in eight weeks."
28641,"Koreans go all fucking out. You want scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast? Fuck that. And fuck you too, for good measure. You're getting seaweed soup, a bowl of rice, kimchi, an egg soufflé, and maybe some sort of meat in a mix of vegetables. Seriously heavy, heavy breakfasts. And my aunts go ape shit if I refuse. Sometimes all I want is a cup of coffee and a muffin man. Oh well, it's good food nonetheless."
28642,The muffin man? Who lives on Drury Lane?
28643,"I taught English in Korea two summers ago, and this sounds almost exactly like what we ate, but I never found it ""heavy"". I was actually really impressed with the balance the meals typically had. From things like the cold cucumber soup to the blazinghotdeath kimchi to the weird burnt rice water, Korean breakfast is one of my favorites."
28646,"Oh god yes. I want this. Put this in my mouth. Down my throat. Into my digestive system, so that I may be happy."
28647,You forgot the thick white toast with salted butter.
28649,"I don't like the taste of it, I think most will agree with you though, my only exception is if it's been soaked in egg beforehand..."
28651,Us Freedom Lovers call that French Toast
28652,no we call it freedom toast! dumbass!
28653,French lovers more like.
28654,"Got this at a cafe once (in NZ) when some friends and I got lost on a road trip. No one else was game to try black pudding. Their loss though, I found out that shit's delicious!"
28656,"Black pudding is amazing, I had it in a wild leaf salad with pigeon with a hot pepper sauce in a tradition British pub once and it's probably the best dish I've ever eaten."
28657,"What kind of poncey pub does a wild leaf salad with pigeon and a hot pepper sauce. Pubs are for pies, toasties, and very occasionally on a sunday a roast. Does sound bloody delicious though!"
28658,Forgot the fried/grilled tomato!
28659,And the mushrooms!
28660,"As an American, I gladly submit defeat. We can't be fat asses in *every* meal."
28662,"Not gonna lie, British breakfasts sound really fucking good."
28664,Oh man. I lived in Raleigh in the late 90's. Moved to Montana. No grits. No country ham. No sweet tea. No BOJANGLES! wah
28665,"Oh, god. Grits. So good. Especially when you crumble up bacon in them."
28666,"came here to say the same, the best thing about the south is the food (and people wonder why the south is so fat)

I could live on [biscuits and gravy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuits_and_gravy). Keep in mind biscuits have a different meaning in America, we aren't eating cookies.

I don't care for grits though. It's a porridge made from corn. You have to dump so much butter and salt on it you might as well just eat a stick of salted butter."
28667,"Before the 'murkan jokes start, not all of this at the same time."
28668,"Not ""my"" country, but where I live, it's pretty typical to have half a toasted baguette topped with olive oil (rather than butter/margarine) and a blended mix of tomatoes and garlic."
28669,"In Mexico, sweet bread or bean tortas."
28670,Mmmm... Conchas
28671,"My favourite local breakfast food is nasi lemak.

28674,Why aren't Britons fatter?
28675,"Two somewhat contradictory answers-

1. Really, I think very few people actually have that for breakfast on a regular basis.  Cereal or toast is more typical.  Full breakfasts are for weekends, hangovers, special occasions etc.

2. UK is the [3rd most obese](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_obe-health-obesity) nation.

Edit: quite a few people are quibbling with this stat.  It was just the first result off google tbh.  Maybe we're not 3rd, maybe we're 4th, or 7th, not really important tbh, the relevant part was Britons are pretty fat already, in the grand scheme of things."
28676,We're just better at hiding our fat people.

28682,"...I've always wanted to know about the beans  for brekkie thing. Are they sweet, or savory?"
28683,"Baked beans, I thinkthey are Haricot beans in a tomato sauce. Beans on Toast is probably the most popular dinner time meal in the UK. You could go even further with beans on cheese on toast, or egg on beans on cheese on toast...it can go on forever."

28686,"Trinidad & Tobago:

We vary based on race, money and day. 

We have street food that could be bought before heading to work called **doubles**. They are two fried channa (chickpeas) pieces of dough folded with chickpeas/curry/tamarind sauce/cucumber. People line up bright and early to buy some and it's also sold at night, only time you might not find it is betwn 1pm-7pm or so. 

**Sada Roti/Pholurie/Paratha** can be eaten in the morning with pumpkin (mashed), tomoto choka (ummm, grilled tomatoes seasoned) or bodi or with butter. Sada roti is served with condensed milk, but it's more of a treat sometimes and may not be eated before school. This is cooked in Indian households, people of African decent would have pholurie/paratha for lunch or dinner. 

**Fruits** of all sorts! I don't remember any house that I went to that didn't have a fruit tree of some sort in the yard. There is usually a basket of SOMETHING at my aunt's house. Oranges, pomerac, bananas, paw paw, cherries, mangoes. And then imported apples, plums, pears and things of that nature. 

**Fry Bake or Roast Bake** Fry bake is not baked, but fried and we say fry, not fried. It's essentially dough that is made into little balls, flattened and fried until they puff up and is soft and golden and delicious. It's eaten with eggs and sausage (hot dogs) or with saltfish (bacalao/codfish), smoked herring, butter/cheese. Roast bake is the same dough, it may have coconut flakes in the dough and it's put in a cast iron and placed in the oven or a gas stove with something covering it. Eaten with the same as the fry bake, but also with pumpkin (mashed). 

**Tea** is anything hot and may include, coffee-tea, coco-tea (hot cocoa), horlicks, ovaltine, nesquik or just plain ol tea. Something or anything is dunked in this. Also in ""cocoa tea"" crackers are mixed in. I never did it, but kids love it. 

**Crix**, the vital supply!!, simple circle cracker, a little heavier than a saltine that now comes in many different flavors and is eaten with cheese, butter, peanut butter, jam (pineapple, guava), eggs, sausage (hot dogs) or vienna sausages (fried with onions, ketcher and peppers). 

Then the usual cereal, milk, eggs, toast, bacon. Maybe yogurt now as it's been introduced to country on a cheaper scale."
28687,I always forget how much indian culture influenced british colonies not in india.
28688,"Yes, indentured labourers were introduced to Trinidad & Tobago over 200 centuries ago after slavery was abolished in 1834. Mostly low caste folks were taken and worked just as hard as slaves, but got their land, small money and had their freedom. 

Now in Trinidad, Indians are the majority at the last census count I believe. And we watch Bollywood films, celebrate Divali, perform poojas and created a twist to some of the indian cuisine, while still having traditional foods and snacks (barfi, kurma, jellaby). 

It's very interesting, though has also created race relation problems to those of African decent (aka former slaves). It doesn't go well with all the classism that occurs on the small island."
28689,Ireland: cereal. We are apparently the worlds biggest consumer of cereal per person.

[Vegemite on Weet-bix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDfALMCW3r4)"
28696,People actually like vegemite?! I thought it was a nation-wide trick to fuck with foreigners!
28697,Of course we do. Best way to eat it is to cake it on like nutella!
28699,"It's an accident. We buy our toast outright down here, but somewhere in the shipping process they are accidentally made into that shape. Something to do with the fact we're upside down and the magnetic poles being different than in China where they're manufactured... I don't even know, the science is ridiculously advanced. It's even been known to effect some humans who come into contact with the machines, and make their bodies into the same shape. Usually this kills them. A couple have survived, but are in intensive care facilities and won't survive long.
  
The equipment requires a certain calibration, but the Chinese are really reluctant to give it to us like that, and make the things so that we can't tamper with them to correct this issue. It's made people completely go off buying toast, and they actually resort to buying bread and toasters again (fucking disgusting, I know).  
  
There is some conspiracy about the toaster companies making a deal with the Chinese government to induce this dilemma, so that people would continue purchasing their toasters. I personally think it's bullshit, only because the amount of money they'd spend paying off the government would exceed toaster profits.  
  
Some people claim that toasters are being fitted with elaborate devices that spy on the owners, specifically for selling the information to advertising companies. This is just taking it a little bit too far in my opinion. The idea that they'd choose toasters is ridiculous when so many people use Weet-Bix instead of toast anyway.  
  
The only credible counter argument to this is that their technology actually hijacks your wifi, and the toaster is the only common household appliance (if the Australia-shaped toast continues to repulse people) that has the necessary hidden space to hide this device. It's also an appliance that you replace more readily than something like fridges, and the point before about low profits could be rendered void if the companies start releasing innovating (and expensive) toasters, that get many consumers to switch to them.  
  
It's a pretty dark time in Australia. To any Aussies reading this, please let your local MP know about this serious issue and help us fight the toaster companies who will **take away our freedom!**"

Hard boiled eggs


Peanut butter and banana sandwich"
28763,"I love putting hard boiled eggs on toast...but I just hate peeling the egg shells, its such a pain"
28764,Tips for easier peeling eggs.  Don't use fresh eggs- better to boil week old eggs.  Drop egg into cold water and bring to a boil (don't drop directly into hot water).  Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to the water.
28765,If you have a pressure cooker it's also much easier to peel eggs if you use it with a steam basket. You can prob steam eggs with a pot of water too and get same effect.
28766,Yeah I steam my eggs in ~1cm of water and they peel easily
28767,How long do you steam them for?
28768,"I put the water on high till it starts to bubble. Then I kick it down to med-high, add the eggs, and let them steam with the cover on for 11 minutes"
28769,"Great, thanks much! I love hard boiled eggs but I hate peeling them too, so I'll have to try this next time."
28770,Also rinse them in cool water after
28771,pressure cooker makes them the easiest to peel in my experience
28772,Huh...I will certainly try this next time. Thanks!
28773,I put my hard boiled eggs in a mason jar with the top on. Gently shake. The shells crack and then I rinse the shells off the egg. Boom. Very easy.
28774,"I cannot recommend this method enough.  

It sounds like one of those bogus life hacks that don't really work.  But the results are amazing."
28775,This may be a dumb question..but do you let the egg shells drop into the sink then? Or do you catch them and throw them in the trash
28776,"I have a garbage disposal so I don't have to worry about that part. If I didn't, I'd put the stopper in the drain, gather the shells, and toss in the trash."
28777,"Not speaking for u/tomtom_lover, but I pour the whole shebang back into the pan of water.  The shells settle to the bottom.  I pour off the water and dump the shells in the trash."
28778,I crack them lengthwise (same axis you would cut along for deviled eggs). don't have to peel much and once one half is off the egg just pops out.
28779,If you keep the hard boiled eggs stored in a container with water you can peel the shell off in two pieces. Literally just crack the egg and it slides off.   Changed your life today.
28780,"On top of this, crash the eggs after boiling time in ice water. The innards contract, and seperate much easier using the shell membrane."
28781,Peel them under running water
28782,Try this instead: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FRj1BdZYft8
28783,"i drop mine over and over about 5 inches above the marble counter, rotating until one half is pretty much just falling off"
28784,"Make a small hole on the small end. Make a larger hole on the large end. Blow hard through the small hole, the egg will come out intact out of the larger hole. You can peel hard boiled eggs like this in less than  10 seconds."
28785,"Take a container, put the boiled egg and some water in it, cover, and violently shake.

Breaks the shell but not the membrane below it so it comes off easily."
28786,Shake it in a Tupperware container. Saves loads of time
28787,"I buy the eggs already boiled and peeled. It’s not that much more (usually $3-4 for a dozen). Well worth it, in my opinion! Also makes great and easy deviled eggs!"
28788,Do you warm them up before eating them? If so how?
28789,Nah but I take them out of the fridge like 30 min before to take the chill off.
28790,make egg cups in a muffin tin. drop them in place wherever you would use hard boiled eggs.
28791,"My advice to use to get a pressure cooker.  

The entirety of the process still takes 15 minutes but the eggs come out perfect every time and very easily peelable.

My guess is the pressure itself pushes the meat of the egg away from the shell.

Edit: looks like others agree"
28792,"Put the eggs in icy water and wait -yes, have to wait - for them to cool down for you to peel the shells. (don't let them pass this point, though. Yes, I did it)."
28793,"I recommend investing in an egg cooker.  Makes cooking them to desired doneness very easy and they tend to peel easier as well.  Also, when peeling them put them under cold water and peel there.  All shells will float and they come off way easier.

28794,"It's so easy to cook eggs correctly, and why have a one use item in your kitchen? Put eggs in room temp water, bring to a boil, throw on a lid and pull it off the heat. Let them sit covered for 8 minutes and you'll have perfect hard boiled eggs."
28795,"This is how I cook my eggs if I need some on a day I'm not already using my Instantpot. If I've already got the IP out to cook a meal in, I'll do 6 eggs in it while gathering and prepping my ingredients but I won't pull it out just for eggs. Rest of the time, I place 5 eggs in my electric kettle, cover with tap water and set to boil. It has an auto shut off once it hits boil so I can just walk away and come back sometime in the next hour and pour off the water before stashing eggs in the fridge. Easiest thing ever and I usually add a good splash of vinegar into the water at the same time to help descale the kettle since I have very hard water.  This method of cooking eggs is seriously underated. Most people don't even know about it and are amazed that eggs boil so perfectly using it without needing a timer or anything."
28796,"Things like this annoy me. It's like the fable of the US and Soviets trying to write things in space: the US over engineered the problem and the Soviets just took a pencil. 

Just learn how to cook eggs, people! It'll take a while but ppl have been managing for generations!
