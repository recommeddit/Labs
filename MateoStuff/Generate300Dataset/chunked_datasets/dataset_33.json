10704,"I either do a TSA Lock or simply wire ties (like on bread). Its mostly to discourage quick pickpocket type thieves. TSA or the determined can get it open rather quick, sometimes with simply a ball point pen. 

Also, don't leave anything of value in a checked bag. Electronics, medications, jewelry you should carry on if you can."
10705,i was thinking about getting a tsa lock but i kept hearing horror stories about them not opening or the tsa throwing the lock away
10706,"Don't get a cheap crappy one. TSA should only throw away or break ones that aren't TSA Approved. But FYI, the reason why some are TSA Approved is because TSA has I think a dozen or so different key types, so technically TSA has a key to open it. However, a few years ago, a reporter talking about this new security measure was shown the keys, took a photo, and this photo was published. Then people reversed engineered and 3d printed the keys. So....not as secure as you'd think. So again mostly just to deter quick thieves."
10707,what locks would you recommend?
10708,"For a carry on? Doesn't really matter. Someone can pop the zipper with a pen and they're in. For checked? Depends, are you traveling domestically and want to travel with a firearm? Then you can use an actual hard sided case with an actual lock, otherwise, again it doesn't matter because you can only use a TSA lock."
10709,"I haven't locked my luggage for thirty years and nobody has ever stolen anything from it. I just use an old paperclip to hold the zipper handles together. When the TSA (or other similar authority) removes it on occasion, it's not terribly hard to replace."
10710,LPT: Don't put anything valuable in your checked luggage. If it's worth more than $50 or irreplaceable then you should put it in your carry-on bag(s).
10711,This is the real LPT here. I have had valuables taken twice by TSA that were not on any kind of restricted list.  They will steal your shit.
10712,[Truth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x00oGJb1KfI)
10713,"Love how the dude tries to blame his wife, fuck thats funny."
10714,His wife was also stolen from a TSA checkpoint.
10715,But was promptly returned. For obvious reasons.
10716,She should've had a tracking device. Her mistake
10718,Extra tip at the end you may not have seen; Starter pistols and flare guns count as firearms.  So you can get a cheap starter pistol without any need for a gun permit.
10719,"> The only real answer is to bring and declare a firearm in each of your checked bags.

That might work where you live, but most other countries would be like ""why the fuck is there a gun in your bag?"""
10720,"Which is why you should always ship wine if you need to transport it. Not hard to steal wine bottles out of checked baggage, and you can't take it in a carryon.  Packages can at least be tracked and insured."
10721,"If you declare you are carrying wine/liquor in your checked bags, and use the airlines shipping containers, it's very difficult for it to get stolen.  Again, nothing is impossible, but UPS and FedEx stuff has been stolen as well."
10722,UPS and FedEx wont ship wine and it's also illegal due to state laws wanting their tax monies.
10723,"They will ship wine, but not from consumer to consumer which is the point I think you're trying to make.  There are licensed retailers (wine.woot.com, etc) that do ship by UPS though."
10724,Best LPTs are always in the comments.
10725,LPT: read comments of LPTs for best LPTs.
10727,I put myself through college as a ramp rat. No one does this. There simply isn't time to rifle through bags mid-load.
10728,"I can't say that I've seen bags being broken into.  

However, I've arrested over a dozen baggage handlers over the years rifling through and stealing US mail.  In two separate occasions, the baggage handler inside the plane opened our Express mail bags and opened our test piece (which was wired to alarm upon opening).  Most just took the mail, pocketed it, and then were eventually caught as they were leaving for the day.

These employees that loaded the airplanes did not work for the airlines; they worked for contractors that paid barely over minimum wage.  Most of the ones we interviewed said they needed the extra money due to the low wages."
10729,"Curious.  Does your test piece silent alarm, or alarm and alert the thief as well? Couldn't the suspect claim they ""accidentally"" opened the mail\package, or the package was already open\loose, and got rustled?"
10730,It's a silent alarm.  We wire up the device inside of a mailpiece so that it will go from beacon mode into alarm mode (audible on our radios) upon opening.
10731,"So do the packages squawk ""Help! Help! I'm being abducted!""? Because if not, I bet you could reprogram them to!"
10732,TSA have their own little private screening room and time to go through the bags. We ramp agents touch your bag long enough to scan it as 100 more are on their way up the belt loader that you have to Tetris into a tiny ass bin.
10733,How do you guys make sure the weight is balanced if you're loading that fast?
10734,"You actually don't really need to take that into consideration most of the time. If a plane has only one bin, job done. If you have two or three you load whichever one needs more weight first. Some planes are front heavy, so you fill the back bin, and put extra or gate checked bags in the front. You only really run into weight issues if you have a flight with like 5 bags. We use 50lb sand bags to add the needed weight."
10735,My carryon costs $50 but your sand bags fly for free?
10736,Yep ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
10737,"Doesn't always apply. I've had to bring my swords on the plane with me for tournaments and there's no way on earth they're gonna let you take that through security. Gotta be checked, declared, and still the intermediary airport will tear a hole through your bag that requires a full roll of duct tape to close, only for them to find perfectly legal swords being transported in perfectly legal ways.

You can't always bring things with you and security still gives no shits about taking care of things."
10738,I don't know if this will work with your swords but firearms can be checked if in a hardcase with a non-tsa lock and inspected at the check-in desk so TSA doesn't fuck with it.
10739,"Had a tsa lock, opened it at security anyway to show them and clear it, closed it back up and given the ok. It wasn't the airport that cleared it that tore my bag open, it was the stop off before the final destination that did. Not sure what else we really could have done, it was cleared (and therefore should not have been tampered with in the first place) and yet they still chose to fuck with it."
10740,"It won't work with swords, but he's talking about throwing in a basic gun with your luggage. This forces security to actually check your bag with you present and requires that you use a hard case and non-tsa lock."
10741,"put a gun in with your sword, problem solved!"
10742,"You joke, but some folks pack blank-firing starter pistols (TSA treats them just like firearms) for this exact reason."
10744,I like how you shortened thousand to k and then spelled out dollar instead of $
10746,"Yes, they will.  The gun has to be in a locked, secure container, but that container doesn't have to be a gun-specific case.  It can be a large lockable suitcase with all your other luggage also secured.  It's a fairly common tactic among security-paranoid travelers to pack a gun in with your other stuff specifically to get the special treatment.

The TSA still opens the bag to confirm the contents, but they do so with you present.  It's then locked with a non-TSA lock and not opened again until you collect it at your destination."
10747,One of my favorite Reddit pastimes is checking useless LPTs for the real LPT.
10748,LPT: Use cable ties to guarantee TSA will open your bag to check it.
10749,THen get mad when there is no course of action you can take with TSA because its TSA.
10751,Next time ship your air guitar. There's nothing they can do about it.
10752,You make me want to send a hard to open box with locks outside and for bonus when they open it. It'll be full of locks
10753,Glitter bomb.
10754,I'm pretty sure it's a war crime to deploy glitter bombs.
10755,The TSA isn't a party to the Geneva Convention.
10756,"I found [something even better](https://www.amazon.com/18-000-Live-Ladybugs-Guaranteed/dp/B00YFE9KN0/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1467830595&sr=8-9&keywords=live+lady+bugs), they're not even that expensive"
10757,"War crimes are one thing, but going biblical on them and the surroundings might be a step too far.

Besides, I'd hate to kill so many for something they didn't do."
10758,"Does anyone sell 18,000 cockroaches?"
10759,"What if you had 3 suit cases inside of each other, but each had glitter filling the extra empty spaces? Then lastly you can have a dickbutt taped to a rock in the inner most case. 

Make sure that the outside case looks really expensive. You know that after they scan in the curiosity will indulge then to open it. In fact I would go one step further and write on the outside stating that there is only glitter and a rock inside in bold letters."
10760,"I just pictured this on /r/HighQualityGifs with a combined gif scenario going; involving Seven, The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction, etc. mixing the ""actual"" opening shots with ""imagining"" opening shots only to end [here](https://i.imgur.com/Xw22ahs.gif) with glitter dickbutts flying out."

10772,"I one time filled my checked luggage to the max weight of 50 lbs with individually bubble wrapped, and quite annoyingly taped, beer bottles. At my destination, every single bottle was unwrapped and rewrapped using ""inspected by tsa"" tape. Interestingly, the original tape was not cut, but there was tons of evidence of frustration by the way it was all stretched. 

I picture this pissed off tsa agent struggling with every bottle while a barrel of confiscated blades sits not too far away."
10773,"Nah.  Some guy opened it and said ""Sweet!  I get to sit on my ass and unwrap bottles for the next hour!"""
10774,"Honestly probably this. Who wouldn't be happy to hear they get to stop doing their routine job dealing with the public and get to have a nice sit down unwrapping bottles, and still get paid. 

Frustrated TSA? Probably made that attendant's day."
10775,Now that I've been reflecting on this: I really hope the agent wasn't some recovering alcoholic. That'd be brutal.
10777,Lol I think they'd fucking love that.
10778,"For work I use zip ties to seal Pelican cases of electronics.  I include extra zip ties in the case so TSA can possibly replace them after they cut them to search the case.  Believe it or not, TSA seems to replace them about half the time."

10786,"I'm at work where Youtube is blocked, but there is a video that shows just how easy this is. You insert a pen into the zip to separate the teeth, and when you're done, just slide the zipper handles around and they will reseal. If you did in fact lock it with cable ties in a way that restricts movement of the handles, it's up to the TSA agent to duct tape your bag back together or not. They would probably just cut the tie though."
10789,"Yeah, they just cut that

Personal experience"
10791,"Great, but then what?"
10792,I found this to be the most reasonable comment here.
10793,Ever try to talk into a gorge? It's gonna be like that.
60149,[redacted]
10795,"Ive had that for about 4 years, now what?"
10796,"Well I put these zip ties on my pelican case when I fly with firearms. The TSA has to have you present when they check firearms so if I see my case coming off the baggage belt and the zip ties are gone or damaged I'm taking it straight to TSA to open and inspect. It means they broke the law/rules. I usually do two different color zip ties on each latch with locks. Firearms cases can use non-TSA locks as well. However, I wouldn't put it passed some TSA people to not care or cut them without realizing the rules. 

It's kind of difficult to just open your firearms case up to make sure you have all your contents unaltered at an airport."
10798,"My gun case is the luggage. It does not fit in a soft case. You're right though, TSA can't make any identifying marks on the case indicating it's a firearm. However, seeing a pelican case (especially if it's a 1700 series) has a high probability or being a firearm. Secondly, pelican cases in general are seen as carrying important and often valuable stuff (cameras, guns, electronics/computers) so they are already a theft risk. 

Plus if you're smart and noticed non-TSA locks you would have again a high chance of some sort of firearm in that case or it would have to have TSA locks."
10799,"But the tsa leaves a card telling you they went through your bag, and I don't think I've ever once flown without them doing it."
10800,"I used to fly often enough with tripods that looked like pipe bombs and technical-looking bags full of wires. The TSA agents and I would write notes to each other on the large cards, and it got to be a running gag. I tried to start up a game of hangman with them, but couldn't get them interested."
10801,"LPT for those who might be tempted to play hangman with the TSA: don't make the hidden word ""EXPLOSIVE"" or anything like that.

In most other circumstances, ""EXPLOSIVE"" is a pretty good word for playing hangman."
10802,"So that's how you sneak 'EXPLOSIVES' through the TSA checkpoints...

Nah, nothing like that. I think it was CUPCAKE."
10803,"I bought a decent number of boxes of sculpting clay once and brought them back in my checked luggage. They're they kind that concept artists use to sculpt things for movies or action figures, they come in brick sized blocks and half my case was probably taken up by them.

I'm not surprised they fucked up my luggage that time, to be honest."
10804,That you know of. With TSA's theft problem I could see this being useful.
10805,Knowing that they've been in your bag does not come with an admission of what they stole.
10807,You know when they leave the paper that says they have been in there in there.
10808,So?  What does that achieve?
10809,"Feel smug that you know ""the man"" searched your bag.

... which you consented to when you checked it."
10810,"It also let's you know to check for stolen items. Rather than finding out a week later when you're going ""where the hell is that thing"""
10811,"Oh no, they stole his laser!"
10812,"[Many hard cases](https://www.amazon.com/Samsonite-Luggage-Winfield-Fashion-Charcoal/dp/B00EALLN56/ref=sr_1_2?) lock the handles in a specific place, preventing re-zipping after opening them with a pen."
10813,"I could see those ass holes opening it up anyway then being like, oh fuck it you fucked up by not letting me zip this back up... Then your shit goes everywhere or they like fucking plastic wrap it closed 

But that's awesome and I like it"
10814,The luggage comes up wrapped exactly as described in plastic.  Then you have to sit there and unwrap it without anything sharp to cut the plastic with and everyone staring at you like you're an idiot.
10815,"Of course, if the concern is that TSA is stealing from luggage, you've just made it easier for the agent to get into the bag without you knowing. That's a TSA approved lock which they have keys into."
10816,I think most people are concerned about the baggage handlers. Seeing as how they do most of the work behind scenes.

10818,"Airline ""lost"" my luggage on vacation once. They called me to pick it up and I left the luggage key at my grandma's house. They were gonna send me back and my cousin who works at the airport stepped in. She's like stop bullshitting and just check her bags. She took out a pen and opened it right in front of everyone. All other people picking up their lost luggage looked pretty shocked."
10819,I don't get it. Why did they need to open it for you to pick it up?
10820,Customs. International trip.
10821,LPT: Don't check anything valuable in an airport unless it is in a hard case.
10822,A hard case can still be opened by the TSA.
10823,"That's why you travel with a firearm. You declare it to your airline, they have you walk it over to TSA baggage screening. They screen it in front of you, then you lock your hard-sided case with a non-TSA lock.  They are not supposed to open it without you present.

Don't want to travel with an actual firearm, or can't because of state laws? Flare guns are legal in every state and considered firearms. (You just can't travel with flares.) [edit] also starter guns, which can only fire blanks.

[edit2] Obviously only works in the US, and obviously should only be in your checked luggage. Look up the TSA and airline regulations."
10824,"> That's why you travel with a firearm. 

Well that escalated quickly"
10825,I'd say that escalated immediately.
10826,"I fly a lot and started having my bags checked pretty frequently. I've had 2 cell phone chargers disappear, and a bottle of conditioner left open enough to spill all over my bag. I had packed it in a ziploc bag with the shampoo, but found it out of the bag next to a nice little note from the TSA saying they checked it. I started flying with a firearm and haven't had any issues since. It only takes a couple extra minutes and is totally worth it to me even if not traveling with ""valuables."""
10827,Doesn't that just take up more time and kind of an extreme just to ensure the safety of your baggage?
10828,"It's not exactly advice for the average joe, but it's handy for people like travelling photographers and musicians who might well be carrying upwards of thirty thousand dollars in equipment on and off planes every few weeks."
10829,Yup. Also you never know when you'll be stranded on a desert island and need a flare gun
10830,You can't travel with a flare though. Just the gun.
10831,"It's not a big deal and actually provides a lot more security.  For example if you arrive and your bag doesn't normally the hamster at the airport says ""we'll find it if we do"".  When you say ""hey my bag with a firearm in it is missing"" they give a lot more shits cause the TSA and ATF are next in line to give some shits."
10833,"If it's that valuable, I'm keeping it in my carry-on."
10834,Takes about 5 minutes. Not really that extreme if you are traveling with anything valuable.
10836,"Yeah, I do this as a matter of course, because once you get the hang of it, it's way easier than keeping all the correct cable ties and cutting them to the right length. Rather than cable ties and side cutters I just have to carry a small blade, which is all you need to open them reliably. Only very occasionally do I have to replace one."
10837,But if you carry a small blade you can't get in the plane
10838,It's not clear to me how this helps you.  So you know the bag has been opened.  AND?
10839,"I agree. TSA has the right to open your luggage it's pretty obvious when they do check as I've noticed my luggage packed slightly different on several occasions. 

Not sure what help this gives other than a confirmation that someone checked your luggage."
10840,"Not only that, they almost always leave one of [these](http://www.ugandamission.net/travel/air/image/tsainspect.jpg) in the bag. They're not trying to hide it."
10841,"ELI5 (Never been through an American airport).. Why do they open your luggage when you're not there? Any baggage you take on the plane have to go through that a scanner, along with your belt and such, and you have a luggage inspection when you arrive at your destination.. why would there be a need for TSA to go through your luggage in between these two inspections?

- A European"
10844,Last time I flew I found a little note in my bag that said the TSA had checked it.
10845,"You can file with TSA to get the value of what was stolen or damaged back. 

TSA dropped my motorcycle helmet and they cut me a cheque to replace it. I had to provide a letter from an expert on motorcycle safety saying how dropping a helmet compromises it's ability to protect me in a crash and that a helmet should be tested or replaced, the $500 replacement was cheaper and easier than international shipping and inspection fees plus the possibility of having to replace it anyways.

Plus it was cool having a $500 cheque from the USA government, especially since I'm Canadian! 

Also in my last few flights and border crossings to the USA I have never had any problems."
10846,"Zip ties can be released with a small screw driver. 

You can definitely take them off without compromising them."
10847,another thing that works is the end of the zip tie
10848,This is the real lpt right here.
10849,"Yep. Or a small pocket knife, or even the end of a small key. Done it before with zip tied liquor bought at port while on a cruise. Easy."

10854,"I did this when I used to travel a lot more.  I had some bright green zip ties that I would use.  (They also made my generic black luggage a bit easier to find on the carousel.)

I'd put spares, bright orange ones, on top of my stuff, in a baggie labeled ""TSA - Please use these to relock""

Just about every time, I'd get my bag back sealed with bright orange ones.

Never had anything disappear from my bags."
10855,It's like your TSA workers are from the 50s
10856,"Okay. So you use a zip tie to lock your luggage. You retrieve your luggage and notice the zip tie has been cut. ""Ah ha!"" You proclaim. ""Someone has been in my bag.""

10872,It's dangerous to airline revenues.

10875,"95% failure rate, yay!"
10876,"Lol silly, just put the knife in your checked bag."
10877,Make sure you take scissors or a knife instead.
10878,It's probably worth the risk. 95% of the time they won't find it on you anyway
10880,Every time my bag's been opened there's a love letter from the TSA notifying me.
10881,Yeah a love letter and my weed right underneath it (previously in the inner zipper pocket) . Good guy TSA agent
10882,Probably too much paperwork involved if they report it.
10883,"Nah, man. If you had checked closer you would have noticed there was enough for one bowl missing."
10884,"There's a talk by a guy who flys with firearms in his checked luggage for the simple fact that it is handled more securely.  You're pulled to the side from the checked luggage line, it has to be checked in front of you and then locked, and is not allowed to be unlocked until it's back in your possession at the destination terminal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGjddG5Owsc"
10885,This is the information I've seen in the past. You can check an unloaded starter pistol in your luggage and your luggage ends up more secure and likely to reach your destination. If you have expensive equipment in your luggage it prevents concerns that people are stealing/damaging stuff. And no one wants to be the guy who lost a suitcase with a gun in it.
10886,"Won't it make my bag look like it has something to hide?

Thus it will be more likely to be opened?"
10887,"Many folks overseas wrap their luggage in Saran Wrap (cling film).

One problem in 3rd world countries is that they will open your luggage and insert drugs, to later on be ""found"" at customs, so they can lock you up and then get you to pay them thousands of dollars in bribes to be released.

Zip ties have one problem - they can be replaced with new zip ties.

200 feet of cling film is a PITA for a cargo clerk to unwrap or cut away and dispose of discretely."
10888,"If you check a firearm, you can lock your luggage and nobody is allowed to open it outside of your possession. You do not have to use a TSA lock."
10889,"What's the point of this? The TSA is just going to cut it before anyone else even gets near your bag. Or is this to know whether or not the TSA went through your bag? In my experience the TSA always puts a card telling you they searched your bag, and even if they don't it's pretty safe to assume that yeah they did."
10890,"This is the worst.
Locking your luggage in a way that makes it ""impossible to open without it visibly showing"" is a sure fire way to get them inspected and basically"
10891,Basically what? WHAT??
10892,The TSA got him before he could
10893,Don't put valuables in your checked luggage.
10894,"This is a useless LPT. You can pretty much assume that someone is going to open your bag if you check it and it's got anything other than clothes and toiletries in it. The TSA will open it. They will cut your cable tie and if there's something missing, finding out before you leave the airport isn't going to do you a damn bit of good. If you do only have clothes and toiletries in there, then you have no reason to care if someone opened it. If you're going to take electrics, or optics, or medicines, or jewelry then you should put that in your carryon bag.

Preferably you shouldn't pack anything but your clothes for about a week (or two max) (even if you will be gone longer since you can wash them), a hand full of toiletries travel bottles of soap, shampoo, and toothpaste, medicine that you need to take, a camera, and a laptop if you need it. Toiletries for longer than a couple of days are unnecessary, the hotel will provide some to you, and you can always stop at the local 7-11 or whatever to get something if you need it.

If for some reason you need bring some large, bulky, fragile, valuable item (like a musical instrument) it's better to ship it via fedex or something. Just call the hotel where you will be and arrange for them to receive it. Get it insured for equal or greater than its replacement value and ship it. If something happens to it you can get it replaced. That's way easier than trying to get the TSA to pay you for crushing your acoustic guitar. (LPT: You will have better luck getting blood out of a stone than getting the TSA to pay for something they broke or stole.)

Take it from someone who likes to enjoy overseas vacations, if you can limit your luggage to a single carry on do that. If you are of a normal size, don't take more than a couple of days worth of clothes, because you can buy more when you arrive. (You don't even need to take them home if you don't want. It'll probably cost you less to buy clothes there and just leave them behind than to check an additional bag.) Take only a day or two of things like toothpaste, shampoo, etc... You'll probably end up in a situation where you will need to use them occasionally, but most of the time they will be provided by your hotel and you can always buy some from the store if you need to. Other than that, take whatever medicine you need (plus a little extra in case you get stuck somewhere) and limited electronics. Maybe a single laptop or tablet with wifi and a smart phone which will accept a SIM card from the country that you will be going to. (If you don't have one of those, then it's better to just buy a cheap burner when you get there.)

LD;DR: Don't put anything in a checked bag which you would care if someone took it, and preferably don't check a bag at all."
10895,Cable ties can be easily defeated and returned to their original position without any signs of tampering.
10896,"Actually, they can still get into your bag if your bag has a zipper. Shove a pen in the zipper and it peels open easy. Locks are a false sense of security"
10897,"What?

Am I missing something? 

The TSA can look in whatever bag they want, that's why we can't use padlocks anymore. 

What's the point of this?"
10898,"Better lpt: use only hard-sided luggage with no zippers, and don't use TSA padlocks. If you're going to be checking something valuable, put it in a hard-shell pelican case or similar and get good padlocks"
10899,And then ship the pelican case to your destination.
10900,I once tried to ship a pelican but it was just making too much noise. Just getting it into a suitcase was a real struggle.
10901,"If you're taking something valuable, you're probably better of shipping it.  When I travel, I usually take two laptops in my carry on, leaving all of the accessories in my suitcase with my clothes and tools.  If it's  something I can't carry on or is rather valuable, it goes to fed ex."
10902,"They can cut the locks when they screen the case.

Unless you travel with a firearm. Hint: flare guns are considered firearms.

They screen it in your presence, and you retain the key/combo to the non-TSA lock. Once it's screened, they are not supposed to open it without you present."
10903,"So that you can be like. You open my shit, and they can be like yes."
10905,"If I can offer 4/5, I really like Fjallraven's Kanken backpack. They're a little on the pricy side, but extremely durable and I personally find them really cute once customized (I can upload a picture of mine if you're at all curious). They were originally designed for comfort and fixing the back problems of Swedish elementary school kids, then eventually they did adult backpacks as well. They have a special strap design that helps spread the weight of the bag over your back so it helps discomfort. I have scoliosis so most backpacks hurt my back really badly, this one barely at all."
10906,I’d love to see your backpack :)
10907,"https://imgur.com/a/17tfTVQ

Here you go! Mine isn't super decorated but it's fun to have something I can customize."
10908,You’re really starting to sell me on Fjallraven...
10909,"Haha, I like them so much I'm considering buying one of the mini ones as a more day to day bag! I was really skeptical at first but I'm shocked at how much I ended up liking it. I think they deserve the hype they get here in California. They do sell them at ASOS if you're at all curious at looking at one in person. 

Edit: subtly realizes ASOS is an online store. brain fart"
10910,hey i was just wondering what size you would recommend for a school bag? i’ve been looking to get one and not sure if the regular one will be big enough for notebook/my small laptop or if the 15” laptop bag is the way to go
10911,"How big is your laptop? I have the regular sized one and an 11"" Chromebook and the Chromebook fits snugly, so if your laptop is any bigger I'd suggest the 15"" laptop one! There's a little laptop pocket in all of them (the ""laptop"" specific ones just have a padded pocket instead) and that's where I put mine. The rest of the backpack is super roomy, I normally carry both a food and water hydroflask, a notebook, and a book and still have room to spare."
10912,"hm ok, mine is 13” in think, it’s a surface. i will prob go with the bigger one then. thanks!"
10913,"No prob! Having the padded section for the Surface wouldn't hurt, either"
10914,Agreed. People ask me if they're actually good or just trendy. They are amazing. So comfortable and durable.
10915,"Yeees, the amount of relief they offer to my back is phenomenal. I always recommend the smaller ones to people with kids, gotta save those backs early."
10916,"I have the regular 15 inch laptop kanken, but I also have a 17 for days when I need the space and even the 17 inch is comfortable!"
10917,"while some people may disagree, i've had nothing but a good experience with my north face backpack. it's durable, has a built in laptop sleeve, not too heavy, and is spacious enough to carry multiple textbooks! my other favorite is LL Bean, i used those in middle/high school and still have them to this day!"
10918,"I don't know who would really disagree with this. TNF backpacks are really well rated and great city packs, Just not the best for actual outdoors weight/space ratio. I love my recon, so this is my recommendation as well. The padding is all super comfy. Has a ton of space. Looks good. Definitely my favorite of the function based pricier options 

If you want something cheaper I'd just get a jansport. I've been ripping the label off of them since middle school and they're a great minimal canvas backpack."
10919,"I can vouch for the Recon too. Really comfortable, spacious enough, stylish, and has an awesome laptop sleeve and an extra tablet sleeve to keep them safe. I've had mine for 4 years now and plan on using it for when I transfer to uni this fall."
10920,I carry swissgear bags
10921,"I agree...Swissgear, Jan's port or Oakley"
10922,"Can also vouch for Wenger. Found them cheaper than Swiss and have used mine for traveling and school, still looking great. 

Edit: English"
10923,my bag was only 40$ so it depends lol
10924,Can't really go wrong with Jansport. I've had mines since freshmen year of high school and it's still very sturdy.
10925,"I had one of those backpacks, they were unfortunately too small to fit all my things"
10926,"I just bought a North Face Recon backpack. It's spacious, comfortable, lightweight, and is pretty nice looking. It gives off a rugged look like you mean serious business with your gear. 

The only thing is that it's $99, but it lasts forever. If you a slightly cheaper backpack with the same quality and more color choices check out the borealis backpack."
10927,"I had a north face in high school for 4 years.  Liked it so much I got the updated model for college.  North face is the way to go, I still use the one from high school all the time and it's in great condition."
10928,Currently $60 !!
10929,I have a Jansport and it is super sturdy but rough on my back and causes a lot of backpain.
10930,"I’ve had a couple Vera Bradley backpacks and I love them! They last a while and are a good quality. I’ve tried jansport but they are always super droopy and it really bothers me, but my Vera Bradley’s have never done that. Although they do tend to be a bit girly"
10931,"LL Bean makes the best backpack, lifetime warranty they never break or tear. I’ve had one since first grade that I use for airport travel and one I’ve had since 7th I’ve been using ever since. Not sure about style when it comes to what your looking for but if you want your money’s  worth, this is your best bet"
11075,Herschel
10933,"I've carried [this](https://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Madrone-Cycling-Backpack-Full-Cycle/dp/B00E1O2DK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) Timbuk2 backpack for ~5 years now and it's still going strong. I especially like how waterproof it is - I've never had anything inside get wet, even walking around in pouring rain."
10934,Actually gorgeous. Not sure if it being “made for women” is necessarily gonna be uncomfortable for guys lol
10935,I don't think they sell that specific bag anymore unfortunately lol. They are having an [end of season sale](https://www.timbuk2.com/collections/sale?refine=product_type-Pack&page=1) rn though.
10936,Target has some good backpacks
10937,"I’m an incoming freshman and just recently got myself a Swiss gear backpack at Sam’s Club. I really like how durable it is so far and the large amount of pockets it has.

But throughout most of high school I used High Sierra backpacks which are relatively cheap and also great quality. I would suggest looking at warehouse clubs like Costco or Sam’s Club. Sometimes they have good deals for good brands of backpacks. My Swiss Gear was only $40."
10938,"Patagonia blackhole 26 liters. 

Best I've ever owned. Super lightweight, easy to carry around, fits a ton of things. Only issue is that there aren't many pockets, but that issue is solved with a nice pencil case/pouch."
10939,"I have a Lands End backpack and it’s pretty good! It holds a lot and it’s pretty comfortable. 

I used to have an Adidas backpack but my former roommate broke it. Before it broke, 10/10 nice backpack."
10940,"I can't comment on the durability because I just got it a month ago and haven't actually used it much yet, but for $30, I got this backpack that has every feature you'll ever need (including ones you didn't know you needed) and looks nice IMO.

10941,Really nice pack. Personally a little too bulky for school but might pick it up later for travel!
10942,"Another lover of LLBean. I got mine in 2007 as I started 7th grade and used it through college. I still have it and it still in great condition. Like it looks a little well-loved but hasn't lost any functionality. I have no reason to get rid of it so I use it for trips, the gym, etc. I bought a new backpack for grad school for appearancesake only"
10943,Targus ftw around 70 or less for some and great. Janspkrt of course for 50 and under on sale.make sure either is big enough for your laptop!
10944,"Ful backpacks. They're understated in appearance, many pockets, can hold a laptop, padded and completely waterproof in a torrential downpour"
10945,"I've got a Osprey Comet, and I really like it. Got it for about $60 on Amazon. Comes with a lifetime warranty, and definitely has enough space for everything you can need."
10946,I think jansports has a lifetime warranty
10947,"It absolutely does. Last I checked (a couple years ago), they will attempt to repair/clean rips, tears, and stains, but if they can't or it's too costly they will replace it with either the same model or the closest they have on stock. Pretty sure you just pay shipping."
10948,I still have my Jansport backpack from 2002. No tears or rips. Still going strong. Used as a high school bag and college and now just around the city or airport carry on. Great bag!
10949,Check out Osprey packs as well.  Moosejaw has a great black one that is perfect for what you are looking for. It’s called the Esteban.
10950,Check out this thread for a ton of options: https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8uaj1y/your_favorite_for_backpacks/
10951,"Ive had my northface Hot Shot since i was a sophomore in HS, now a grad student. Got me thru 2 laptops, travel, drops, and it can function as a daypack. I rec black so it dosent get dirty."
10952,"Had one in green, loved it to death. Swapped out for a vintage-styled one that had a rolltop and buckles and that shit was crazy annoying to get into/close up afterward. Stick with solid materials/construction and ease of entry + ideally a comfy fit & some water resistance and you’re gonna be good to go"
10953,Only thing steering me away from some Top Designs models and other small companies is roll tops.
10954,"I'm not a huge Northface fan, I think most of their stuff is overpriced for marketing, but I love my Recon pack. Hiked around Turkey with it and never had any problems with it, and it's definitely nice enough to carry around for college, and it comes in a lot of different colors to boot."
10955,"recently me neither. My hotshot is from 2010, now a days TNF has definitely lowered R&D budgets in favor of a large marketing one. The dad has a few vintage ones from the 80's and theyre still in great shape."
10956,I use a Timbuk2 pack and have been satisfied so far. Bought at REI.
10957,"Little bit pricey but I love my topo

https://topodesigns.com/collections/backpacks/products/daypack?variant=43210387271"
10958,Is it big? It looks pretty large maybe its just because its flat
10959,"I wouldn't say they are big, but just ideal. I'm 5'9 and it looks really slick and fits well on whatever I wear. They also have variety of other versions so you could check them out as well."
10960,"It's helpful to look at the sizing in liters to compare different bags. This one is 20L, which would generally be ""normal"" size for a bookbag."
10961,"I love my Kenneth Cole Reaction An Easy Pace. It has lots of space, is durable and comfortable and I like the leather accents"
10962,"Herschel backpacks are pretty sweet. I have one myself and even embroidered my name on it. I believe this is the backpack I have (in blue) but they have more than one style and different prices for your taste.

10963,Everlane everlane everlane.
10964,Nah the snap pack is not practical for college use
10965,Nah I think it is; had mine for two years and it’s been great
10966,"I have an everlane bag for 3 years, but the color on the bag is fading and it is torn on the bottom. I would say the nylon commuter bag is probably better for college. I still think it's a great bag though."
10967,"I'll politely disagree. Imo, it can't carry enough stuff to be a daily workhorse college backpack. It's great for bringing stuff to the office or gym, but there are way better options for campus"
10968,"Then look at one of the many other options, perhaps?"
10969,"I'd recommend maybe checking out Targus or Swiss Army for something more geared toward also housing a laptop.  My Targus bag is pushing 15+ years old.  It has made it through my college days, countless airport runs, and tons of general use.  It currently houses a 15.4"" laptop and the recording gear I haul around, plus the straps are still squishy and comfortable.  And if it matters, the above brands have a bit more mature/sophisticated styling."
10970,"I do like the simple look of them, but they seem a little big for my needs"
10971,"Yeah, not sure what the current models look like.  Mine isn't huge at all, but as mentioned, it is an old bag.  It's pretty ""normal"" backpack size.  17"" laptops weren't really a thing at that time though.  I know a lot of bags these days are made to accommodate 17"" laptops."
10972,"Big fan of the Booq Boa Squeeze that was gifted to me. You may enjoy it too if you're looking for something a little off from the traditional backpack shape. Very comfy straps too that have held up beyond my graduation 4 years ago. They have bigger and/or cheaper models as well. 

[https://www.booqbags.com/collections/fan-favorites/products/boa-squeeze-15-inch-laptop-backpack](https://www.booqbags.com/collections/fan-favorites/products/boa-squeeze-15-inch-laptop-backpack)"
10973,"I finished school ten years ago, so I don't know what the backpack situation is on campus these days, but I had good experiences with the two bags you currently have.  I used a black Jansport bag for the end of high school through college.  When I went to grad school I bought a black North Face Jester.  I subsequently bought a padded laptop sleeve to use with it.  It made it through four years of school.  I still have both and both are in good functioning shape. The Jansport is currently used to store my Nintendo Wii and PS2.  I use the North Face on day hikes occasionally or as an overnight bag."
10974,"I really really love my [Cotopaxi Tasra](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/tasra-16-l-pack?variant=45530908234). It [zips in half](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0281/7544/products/tasra_cargo_interior_1200x.progressive.jpg?v=1526508257) instead of just from the top so you can open it on the go like a messenger bag, and it has a lot of organization! It doesnt have a ton of room for anything thats not flat and rectangular though (its not a big pocket like a traditional backpack)"
10975,"I got this one on Black Friday. Original was $80 and I got it for $40! Very nice, good quality, lots of pockets and zippers. Only negative is it has 2 set of straps (one for chest, one for around waist area). The chest strap can be removed they’re just buttons but the others can’t.

There's other options too if you don't like the USB port thing (kinda detracts from the overall look IMO)."

10978,Hershel tbh
10979,"I've been using the North Face Jester ever since my Herschel broke. I'm a university student who commutes to school on a motorcycle and it's perfect for my needs.

I usually have a 13 inch laptop, a few A5 notebooks/binded notes/folder and a 1l Nalgene bottle in the main compartment. Small miscellaneous stuff in the small one. I love that the small pocket has mini compartments so I can organise my stuff. Been using the bag for a year or so and it hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear. The back is nicely cushioned too, and the black matched with everything. So I'd say go for it!"
10980,Topo Designs Klettersack. I've been using mine for nearly three years as a student. It's big enough to use for travel but compresses to small enough for nothing but a laptop and a notebook.
10981,I’ve been using [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV72AWK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3X7QBbCFBB0ZP) Carhartt bag for the past few years and it’s still in great shape.

10983,"At the various price points I would say:

Jansport,  fjallraven, topodesigns, goruck/missionworkshop

I'll throw TripleAughtDesign in there with Topo. Their ""scout"" pack has all the benifits of a small tactical pack while looking decidedly civilian and less like ""that guy that talks way too much about guns"".... I've been using their lightspeed for about 5 years. It's a bit more tacticool unfortunately (I have the molle-free tail on it so it's not so bad), but it was my school bag, and is now my dayhike bag, work bag, carryon, weighted ruck for working out, etc. still looks like new.... 10/10 would buy again."
10984,Aer
10985,"Mission Workshop. Pricey but if you can find one used they are sick, I got a Rambler (MSRP $295) for $80 and it's fantastic, though that model is not as good for campus use (I usually use an old burton skate pack but it has a broken zipper [best way to get zippers fixed?], so the rambler works but isn't ideal) they have smaller packs as well."
10986,"I have had my 5.11 rush 24 since 2012 and its still great. Yeah, college is taking longer than anticipated. 

Edit: just realized this was mfa and not r/college. The backpack I suggested is durable but not necessarily fashionable"
10987,My Rush 24 is holding up great since around 2012 too. Looks as good as the day I bought it. What color did you get?
10988,Black. You?
10989,"Nice, I think you made a good choice. I got Flat Dark Earth or whatever it's called. I sort of regret not getting black, it's kind of hard to pull off this color with more muted outfits haha"

10994,I've had my classic jansport for years
10995,"There was a story on reddit a while ago about a guy and his Jansport. He was sitting on a bench and a guy asked him what happened to the zipper. It got caught in a door or something and became disfigured. Turns out the guy was the CEO of Jansport and ordered him a replacement right away. They are well made and last, would recommend to a reddit friend."
10996,"Jansports quality has gone to shit. I returned 3 backpacks that all broke within a few years of use. Of the three new bags they sent as replacement, 2 of them are already broken again, the third is on its way."
10997,Yeah this ones probably 8 years old probably before the quality dropped
10998,"At least they replace them foe free, right?"
10999,"Even if they do, I'd be on my 7, 8, and 9th backpacks within 6-7 years of purchasing the first 3. That's poor quality."

11006,"I know they're not the most fashionable but honestly for use like that and a college kid, it is perfect. I have a Nordstrom bag I use for work/internships but once classes come around it is North Face time."
11007,i've had my North Face for going on 6 years now and I can't kill it. it's wonderful
11008,"Yeah, in medical school i used a swiss backpack, went through three of them by my second semester. A friend suggested i spent the extra money for a northface backpack and ive never regretted it. Have had it now for 4 years with no problems. Sometimes it really pays off to spend the extra money on things you rely on everyday."
11009,Do you mind telling me which style you own? I've been searching around for nice-looking backpacks as well.
11010,Not at all. Mine is the Surge II.
11011,"The most common one I see around my campus is the Jester, but I nabbed a Borealis on sale for $55 a couple years ago and I love it. Used nearly everyday and still feels and looks grand new."

11013,Students get a 25% discount at GORUCK. The GR1 will last a lifetime.
11014,Been considering buying a goruck for a while. Thanks for the heads up on student discounts. Do you know how to get it applied to an online order?
11015,"During checkout you'll see several ID buttons, and one will say Student. Clicking on that will ask you to create and account, and re-login to GORUCK."
11016,"So I just fell in love with this bag after looking at it's components and attempted to use the 25% as a Student but after signing up with ID.me (the third party used to verify you are one) it won't let me verify saying my information is restricted, just a heads up that you may encounter problems whilst also stealing this thread to ask for advice on the issue."
11017,"Yeah it was a pain when I did it. I think you have to make a GORUCK account, then an ID account, then sign out of GORUCK and sign back in. Something like that. A pain, but worth the discount for such a great bag."
11018,"Just to add on to my current issue this is the message I get when trying to verify my student status through ID.me

Keep you all updated on how that is handled."

That said, I would have never been able to afford it in college. .."
11022,"Really happy with [this Timbuk2](https://www.amazon.com/Timbuk2-Showdown-Laptop-Backpack-Heirloom/dp/B0199DREA2/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1486486102&sr=8-10&keywords=timbuk2) bag, but all of their bags are really nice."
11023,"Another vote for Timbuk2! I have their parkside backpack and it's been through hell and back with me and it's amazing. Suspended laptop/tablet pocket so it won't sit directly at the bottom of the bag, plenty of room to hold all of my textbooks, chargers, calculator, papers, etc and not fall apart."
11024,"I also have a Parkside. Really nice bag as well. Some guy in the Zurich airport tried buying it off of me. No thanks, not even Swiss Francs can persuade me!"
