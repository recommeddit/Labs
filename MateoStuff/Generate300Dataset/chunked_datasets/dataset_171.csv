55865,"I was about to mention National Treasure only to look it up and see that it came out fifteen years ago. Dang man, how did I get so old"
55866,"should've mentioned *National Treasure 2*. that came out twelve years ago

^^^hopefully ^^^nic ^^^^decides ^^^^to ^^^^do ^^^^^National ^^^^^Treasure ^^^^^3 ^^^^^^one ^^^^^^day"
55867,"You think Disney’s going to put money into another National Treasure when they have Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar?"
55868,They wouldn't want to suffocate under the extra cash pile.
55869,"I mean, Star Wars is trending down, and Marvel is about to hit their peak. Why not give it a shot?"
55870,"I watch national treasure 2 the other night and thought damn I miss movies like this, real action, car chases ect. I love superhero movies still but there is something to be said for a more realistic adventure  movie."
55871,That was one of my dad's favorite movies. He fucking loved it. Miss the old bugger
55872,"Mostly got replaced by super heroes movies, same target demographics for the most part"
55873,"Yeah, I think you’re right. Sadly I fall into the weird category of someone who loves adventure movies but really dislikes superhero movies."
55874,"Although I didn't think the movie itself was ultimately very good at all, Aquaman was pretty fun at times because of the Raiders/Romancing The Stone spirit of it all. I'd like to see more superhero movies take the form of globetrotting adventures."
55875,You are not alone in that.
55876,"I don't dislike superhero films, but I am beginning to get superhero fatigue."
55877,it’s good the MCU is starting to be more outer space oriented. I feel like earth based superhero stuff is getting old
55878,Aquaman felt like a pure adventure movie though at least.
55879,The Adventures of Tintin was only (checks watch) 8 years ago!
55880,"Ok, Adventures of Tintin was severely underrated. That was an amazing fucking movie and I do wish there was more movies like that"
55881,That long-take chase scene through Bagghar was awesome
55882,So true. An the animation for it really matched the comics. I thought a sequel was going to be made one day?
55883,"If you like The Princess Bride, watch Stardust. Its on Netflix at the moment."
55884,Stardust is so good! It’s a great adventure film with a cool story and fun characters. It’s like a grown-up fairytale. Highly recommend!
55885,Neil Gaiman literally wrote it as a grown-up fairy tale! If you're into audiobooks he narrates it and it is wonderful.
55886,Absolutely. Stardust is so slept on but it’s a classic in my eyes. Love showing it to people who have no idea about it.
55887,now what's a movie like Stardust??
55889,"the movie is good, you should read the book. they don't show the unicorn beheading in the movie."
55890,"Probably one of my favourite movies ever, I can honestly say i love it just as much, if not more than the book(and I am a slut for Gaiman)"
55891,And it's got Daredevil in
55892,And Superman
55893,*Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* was a recent and rather fun adventure film.
55894,"I had trouble thinking of recent ones, but I agree with that"
55895,you can argue that Aquaman was one as well. At least I really enjoyed the dessert scenes.
55896,"What did they have? Ice cream? Flan? Oooh, adventurous pudding??"
55897,Flowers.
55898,"> Flowers.

Roses."
55899,"The sequences from the beginning of the Sahara, through Sicily (excluding the fight scene) and then the boat ride out to the Abyss felt like an honest to god adventure movie. Think those were my favourite parts of the film."
55900,I had some friends whom were adamant about not seeing it so I never saw it in theaters. I saw it a few months ago finally and I freaking loved it. Everything from the videogamish setting to the characters interactions with each other was just enjoyable all around. I can't wait to see the sequel when that eventually come out.
55901,"I really didn’t want to like the movie; everything about it made me go “Why?!”, but then I was on a work trip and didn’t feel like spending the evening in my hotel so I went to the local theater and begrudgingly watched it.   Ended up really enjoying it. Was far better than it had any right to be."
55902,Exactly. I think that mainly has to do with the cast. That awkward kiss was one of the funniest things I have seen I a while.
55903,I loved how accurately it depicted life in a video game. Stuff like all the NPCs only being able to say generic pre-assigned lines. I never would’ve thought of that.
55904,"I was glad how well it did too. It made almost a billion dollars worldwide, so hopefully the industry takes that as a sign that there's a huge market for fun adventure movies."
55905,Surprise of 2017 for me honestly.
55906,I second that
55907,the characters were fun but the adventure was pretty rote and been there done that feeling
55908,Padington as well n
55909,Don't forget Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Mans Chest
55910,"Yes, some of my favorites actually. Meant to post something like this earlier in the week with those included"
55911,Great movies but they came out 15 years ago
55912,Damn way to make me feel old
55913,"I'll be honest, I enjoyed At World's End too. It was almost like a Game of Thrones style sequal. Lots of different characters, alliances, betrayals, death, plot twists, etc. Plus the music was some of my favorite in the series."
55914,"Agree. Romancing the Stone is one of my favorite movies. Lots of adventure, but enough comedy to where it doesn't take itself too seriously."
55916,"I went to see it without very high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main kid is a pretty good actor (he's Andy Serkis's son), and I hadn't realized that Patrick Stewart had a significant role in it because I don't think he shows up in any of the previews. 

It reminded me of an 80s kid adventure movie with lots of CGI. The main bad guy was genuinely creepy (I thought), but was really flat as a character so that was disappointing. The bad guys are visually intense enough that I can imagine a sensitive 6-year-old having bad dreams because of it. I liked the movie's message, though--it leaves you feeling hopeful.

I suspect that it won't do well at the box office though--it's too intense for really little kids, and comes off as too little-kiddy for the teenage and up crowd. Their target demographic, I'm guessing, is pretty narrow--8-12 years old maybe?"
55917,"> Too many movies forget about the fun aspect and take themselves too seriously. 

The curse of the whole action movie genre."
55918,"But at the same time, the action movie genre is oversaturated with bathos. It's a strange paradox, action movies seem to take themselves both too seriously and not seriously enough at the same time. We don't seem as able to strike a good balance anymore like action movies in the 80s and 90s did."
55919,Hunt for the Wilderpeople scratched that itch for me.
55920,Ricky Baker now you are 13 years old...
55921,"The National Treasure movies get a lot of flak but fuck that those movies are fun and awesome.  We need more fun, large scope adventures like that."
55922,"100%, I used to consider The Mummy a guilty pleasure movie. But now I'm like fuck it, what a fun movie. I just enjoy it"
55923,"Hell yeah, the Brendan Fraiser mummy movies rule."
55924,Kon-Tiki is pretty adventurous.
55925,I know some people rag on it but I really thought Solo was a fun adventure story. It's sci fi adventure but the spirit is still there.
55926,"Huge Star Wars fan since I was 6. Not a big fan of origin stories in general. Wasn’t thrilled they were doing one for Han.

Finally watched it a couple weeks ago. It was such a blast. The new guy was no Harrison Ford, and it wasn’t without it’s issues, but I just had nothing but fun watching that movie."
55927,"As someone already pointed it out Alden was 30% Harrison and atleast 80% Han.
I'd really like to see more of him as Han, young Lando and Qi'ra too"
55928,"Really liked Solo but couldn't ever buy Alden as being the same guy we see in A New Hope. It all comes down to the voice for me; Alden's is too high or nasally or something. Not that I wanted him to do a Harrison impression but Alden's voice was just too different. Also, he's so close in age to Harrison in A New Hope that it's hard to put it down to age difference.

Taken on its own merits though it's a really solid, fun movie."
55929,I hope that Disney veers away from doing anything with older characters. New characters with new stories please.
55930,I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Solo.
55931,It's the best of the Disney Star Wars movies
55932,"Probably Rogue One for me, but I enjoyed Solo a lot"
55933,"The battle above Scarif was so good. It felt like something from the original trilogy.

It was pretty great seeing remastered Red and Gold Leader footage. Looked so much better and not creepy like Leia and Tarkin."
55934,"The first half of Rogue One ranged from bad to average. Once the movie hit Scariff it was amazing.

I enjoyed Solo even with a couple of rough patches. I didn't have high hopes going in as I was worried it would screw over Han's development in the Original Trilogy."
55935,100%. The fact that so many people skipped it because of TLJ's reception or the pre-release concerns is a bummer.
55936,"Opinion of Solo seems to have skyrocketed now that it’s been out for a while. I thought it was painfully mediocre, and the over-explaining of Han’s backstory was so tedious."
55937,I liked the movie but couldn’t believe they put in that scene where he gets his name “Solo”. It was sooo lame.
55938,The beginning 15 minutes was cringe city but it found its footing after that. Han and Chewie felt natural.
55939,I hated that they really tried to explain everything in such quick succession.
55940,"Your name is Chewbacca, huh? I’m gonna need to think up a nickname for you, cause I am not saying that everytime!

*eyes roll out of head*"
55941,"It was mad okay. I saw it a few weeks ago and already forgot most of it, I liked the chase at the beginning though."
55942,"I like the stories better than the new episodes honestly. 

I think Solo would have done better if it was in the Mary Poppins spot. The Christmas release is always the pimp spot for Disney."
55943,"Let me add... I miss adventure movies with more practical effects than CGI. I don't mind good CGI, but I prefer they shoot on location, build more sets, and do more stunts. Especially for the adventure genre."
55944,"I thought about saying something about CGI, but I listed The Mummy which has a lot. So I didn't. In general, I agree with you though"
55945,I feel like now more than ever the world needs a National Treasure 3
55946,I pretend the Nicolas Cage movie Knowing is somehow a National Treasure sequel
55947,"Okay. I think that movies like Raiders or Back to The Future just don‘t get made anymore. That‘s why they are so special.

Try Thor Ragnarok, that‘s really fun and engaging"
55948,"Thor Ragnarok is a mid-80's sci-fi/fantasy B-movie disguised as a superhero film, I love it so much."
55949,"> Thor Ragnarok

The best marvel movie. Change my mind. 

Best sci fi adventure movie since the 5th element."
55950,"If I changed your mind, you'd be wrong."
55951,The jump in quality from the first 2 Thor movies to Ragnarok is unbelievable
55952,I have a soft spot for the first one because I like fish out of water humor a lot
55953,Best Marvel movie is The Winter Soldier. Hands down.
55954,Knight and day was pretty fun also man from uncle was pretty good action adventure
55955,Man from UNCLE was the better movie.
55956,I know...I wish the Indiana Jones series was treated like James Bond. Could have had like 20 awesome adventures by now :(
55957,Are you excited for the upcoming sequel or would you prefer a reboot with a new actor?
55958,"Personally I wouldn't mind a new actor, but they have to keep the time period. They don't all have to logically fit together, but any time between the mid 1920's to the 50's or so. Just random pulpy adventures set randomly in that period of time."
55959,Yup exactly!
55960,Aquaman is literally a Holy Grail movie with a comic book veneer.
55961,And that aspect of the movie is fucking glorious.
55962,"I don't usually use this language but a really fucking love the adventure aspect of Aquaman. I also really love that the whole superhero genre has taken this fantasy/sci fi adventure direction and I hope it sticks with it. Stuff like Guardians of the Galaxy, Wonder Woman, Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor Ragnarok and Doctor Strange."
55963,"Eh, I wouldn't classify it as an adventure though... it's like 95% epic battle sequences."
55964,"That’s really only the last quarter, after he gets the movie’s “Holy Grail”"
55965,Yea I actually came to this thread to say that too. The part I enjoyed most about Aquaman was that it felt like an adventure. The movie moved across the world and felt really fun.
55966,"I really loved that part of aquaman and had same thought as op, it truly is lacking adventure movies."
55967,"Came here to post this.

As much as the movie was overlong, it was genuinely refreshing to have a protagonist who was mostly enjoying himself and going from beautiful fantastic place to beautiful fantastic place."
55968,I wasn't a huge fan of the movie overall but I did love how much Momoa seemed to be having an absolute blast for every minute of it.
55969,Kong: Skull Island?
55970,"I really wanted to be THE epic adventure movie I wished but they took another route to set the ""monsterverse"" with Godzilla. If they rather went with the same uncharted, monster-filled skull island that appeared in King kong, the story could be a franchise on it's own. 

The giant insects pit -of doom- is still my favorite scene. Btw, the extended version of King Kong show several extra minutes of Skull island's wildlife."
55971,"*The Man Who Killed Don Quixote* is certainly an offbeat choice, and it'll be in the US this spring. Don't believe all those early reviews. It had a [7 minute standing ovation at Cannes](https://youtu.be/vV4SZcAS5Xc) and it recently won [Best Foreign Film at Magritte](https://twitter.com/Alacran_Group/status/1091933551346548736)\* in Belgium.

&#x200B;

\* Correction: Best foreign film in coproduction  (i.e. a film with a Belgian coproducer)."
55972,You could even say that Miguel De Cervantes literally wrote the book on these type of adventure stories.
55973,"He did, but Cervantes' work was based on earlier centuries' ""[courtly love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtly_love)"" stories and fables, especially Arthurian stories and lore by medieval authors like [Chrétien de Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr%C3%A9tien_de_Troyes). In *Don Quixote* (Gilliam film), the first line out of Quixote's mouth refers to him resurrecting ""the age of chivalry"". (Also see [here](http://www.casa-arts.org/cms/lib/PA01925203/Centricity/Domain/50/Chivalry%20and%20Courtly%20Love.pdf).)

Giants, for example, are particularly popular in traditional Welsh mythology. Both King Arthur and Gwalchmai fab Gwyar feature prominently as giant-slayers in Welsh tradition."
55974,"It’s not good... sorry.

Saw it a few weeks ago and I so wanted it to be good, but it’s just not. Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce do the best they can, but it’s a disappointingly muddled madness that completely lacks any sort of satisfying cohesion, charm or a decent supporting cast. There's some good stuff in there, but it's frustratingly fleeting. There's a random, episodic nature about it that falls terribly flat and the whole affair feels quite aged already, as though the script hasn't been updated in the intervening years of failed attempts (except the on-the-nose references to said failed productions). The idea just doesn't work very well and it doesn't really feel like Gilliam... feels like someone trying to do an early-Gilliam and not understanding what made those film special.

Hey, that’s my two cents... I hope you tell me to stick it, “you’re so wrong!” and you enjoy it when you see it!"
55975,"It may or may not be good, I haven't seen it, but the amount of clapping a film gets at Cannes isn't a reliable measure of its quality. The festival's audience is known to give long standing ovations, sometimes to pretty meh movies.  It's mostly because most of the film's creators are in the audience. Some good movies have been booed there too."
55976,"As I mentioned elsewhere, the applause may have been more for Gilliam, for finally finishing the picture."
55977,Films bragging about the length of standing ovation time is a new level of “I’ll never watch this move out of spite” hate
55978,If Uncharted movie ever happens they'll make a comeback.
55979,there's been so many writer and director changes
55980,"Frankly, Dan Trachtenberg is probably the first director that I actually am confident can pull it off. Neil Burger, David O. Russell, and Shawn Levy? Not so much."
55981,"I like Dan Trachtenberg, but I'm still going to remain *cautiously* optimistic. Trachtenberg has shown a aptitude for making suspenseful, claustrophobic films with twisted narratives. Setpiece-based adventure is a whole other genre, and until he pulls it off, I'm hesitating to assume he can.

&#x200B;

That being said, it's great that he's genuinely invested in the project and not just trying to make a buck."
55982,Watch the Librarian movies for goofy fun.
55983,The show also had its moments
55984,Lost City of Z?
55985,It was an adventure movie but it wasn’t exactly fun.
55986,"A good movie, but not an adventure movie ***at all***"
55987,"That was such a good movie! Just watched it on a lazy Sunday not expecting much but it was great.

Jungle, starting Daniel Radcliffe, and Green Inferno are other great movies that are somewhat similar."
55988,Green Inferno is not an adventure movie. Unless your idea of adventure is watching people being eaten by cannibals.
55989,"If you by adventure movie you literally just mean a movie depicting an adventure then this may apply.

But Lost City of Z is more of a slow burn. Not really what I think OP is after."
55990,"Ya but that wasn’t a fun adventure movie honestly I
Passed out in the middle and I was really excited for it haha"
55991,Same thing with gaming. Everything is cookie cutter bland bullshit. With multiplayer games at least.
55992,unfortunately all the money that would have been thrown on adventure projects in past decades is now going to Marvel/DC franchise flix. They're the cash cows and big studios & production finance houses aren't huge gamblers with far-reaching visions. They love predictability.
55993,"That's exactly why I really enjoyed last year's Tomb Raider. It was a pretty fun and exciting adventure movie with a likable lead character. I seem to be in the minority with that opinion, but if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend giving it a try."
55994,"The film itself was a little generic, but she was a great Lara. Hopefully she gets another one with a more interesting plot. It's still worth watching though."
55995,"Hmm I'll watch it now. Didn't particularly think it looked that good, but I usually like poorly reviewed adventure movies."
55996,Seemed like no one liked it but I thought it was great. I liked the Angeline ones somewhat but they were a little cartoonish even being based on a videogame. Saying that I still liked them.
55997,Even in that era it's not like big-budget adventure movies released every year. All the titles listed by OP were special event films that were regarded as unique. In recent years we've had The Mummy(Tom Cruise version) and Tomb Raider(the reboot) and now Uncharted is coming.
55998,"Tomb Raider was a decent adventure flick, but skip Cruise's Mummy *at all costs* and watch the Brendan Fraser ones instead."
55999,"> The Mummy(Tom Cruise version) 

That is not a fun adventure movie though, I wish they would've gone for a fun adventure movie instead of a action spectacle movie.

They had 2 ways to go about The Mummy that made sense to me, either a darker more horror focused film, maybe something like Alien or something else.

Or a more family focused adventure type of thing, like the Fraser Mummy-movies.

But, no, they went with spectacle action like Transformers and that segment is so over-saturated at the moment."
56000,“Turbo Kid” is what you’re looking for.  It’s currently streaming on Prime.
56001,"Whenever people ask me why exactly I like the National Treasure movies, I say it's precisely for this reason, people aren't making adventure movies anymore. The National Treasure movies have a lot of flaws (like a *lot* of flaws) but they have the charm of an adventure movie that you just don't see anymore. I want more of that."
56002,I think Paddinton 2 can be described as an adventure movie. A fantastic movie of a bear who goes on a big adventure full of ups and down while trying to get a gift for his step mom. Best movie of 2018 for me.
56003,Would Swiss Army Man be an adventure?
56004,"No.

But it's a good movie."
56005,A farty adventure!
56006,That should've been the tagline.
56007,“The first fart will make you laugh. The last fart will make you cry.”
56008,Tin tin
56009,"Yep. With a few exceptions, attempts at adventure movies in the past decade or so just come off gimmicky and at best uninspired. The sense of discovery and wonder seems to have been lost a fair bit."
56010,Indy 5 comes out in 2 years :)
56011,"You know that doesn't fill most of us with optimism, right?"
56012,"I mean Spielberg has a great track record. If anybody can make a great 5th installment..it’s him. 

Sure, Indy 4 is the weakest of the franchise. But it still has a 78% approval rating which is a lot higher than a lot of modern blockbusters. Plus, they can learn from it. Rocky 5 was terrible, but then we got Rocky Balboa and the Creed films for example."
56013,"I hate to bash on George Lucas, but it'll also be the first Indiana Jones film without him."
56014,Actually he's executive producer on the new one.
56015,"Also, no disrespect to the man, but I personally feel that all of Indy 4’s problems can be attributed to Lucas. Spielberg’s biggest mistake was not reeling back some of the more outlandish ideas as you can tell from some of the behind the scenes footage. I think Indy 5 has a real chance to be good."
56016,"I remember hearing that Spielberg and Ford never liked the plot ideas Lucas had for that movie, and didn't want to do it, which is why the movie took so long to finally get made. Lucas wouldn't budge though, and eventually the other two decided that if they didn't do what Lucas wanted then the movie would never get made, so they grudgingly agreed to it."
56017,I fully agree.
56018,Hmmmmmm...
56019,"Spielberg has made a lot of forgettable crap. I think people forget this sometimes. He can do really good movies sometimes (Jaws, Amistad, etc), but he can also fall on his face (AI, War of the World, etc)."
56020,"I might be in the minority, but I consider AI to be a masterpiece (if you can forget the sentimental ending)"
56021,"The ending to AI is actually enormously sad, but it's definitely hard to parse as that on an initial viewing. 

Put it simply, all of humanity is dead, David is trapped by his programming into 'loving' somebody who stopped existing long ago, and so the only merciful choice available to his distant descendants is to euthanize him. It's wrapped in sentimentality to trick David, but it's a dark ending by any fair standard.

(And it's probably one of Spielberg's best films.)"
56022,Even a poor Spielberg film seems to be good. His lowest rated film is Hook for crying out loud.
56023,"I dunno.. lately they’ve not been great. Ready Player One, The Post, The BFG, Bridge of Spies were all pretty mediocre"
56024,Ready Player One would certainly count as an adventure!
56025,"I could tell Spielberg directed this, there were lots of great adventure vibes in it. I really dug it."
56026,I think they're talking about good movies though
56027,"It's decent. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it with a hangover yesterday. It does make you suspend disbelief a lot, but if you can get past that, it's a fun flick, especially if you know a lot of the references in it."
56028,77% or 3.9/5 (RT) and a 7.5/10 on IMBD demonstrates that a decent number of people thought it was at least good.
56029,I really enjoyed Ready Player One.
56030,Stardust.
56031,"I loved The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  I don’t understand why it didn’t do better at the box office. It was clever, smart and fun."
56032,"I just watched Stargate (1994) again, does that count?"
56033,I thought Aquaman was a great adventure movie. Sure you have to be able to get past the script but if you can get lost in the spectacle and adventure it’s good goofy fun.
56034,Definitely has the feel of an adventure movie more than a superhero movie.
56035,"Just give it a few more years, I'm sure the movie industry will remake all of those movies with slightly altered storylines! Then about 65% of those remakes will go straight into the garbage bin and the survivors of the remake wars will go on to have 3+ movies made milking it for every dollar possible until everyone gets bored and moves onto something else."
56036,I really enjoyed John Carter for this very reason.
56037,Too add to the shaky cam rant....I hate how all fight scenes now thing they have to be a freaking eyeball convulsion instead of just having a properly choreographed fight that doesn’t make me nauseated after it’s done.
56038,John Wick and Mission Impossible Fallout give me hope of seeing better fight scenes in the future
56039,Tin Tin was really good! Also The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.
56040,i'd recommend the single season (8 episodes) of [*Hooten & the Lady*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5663062/) (2016)
56041,I really love Romancing the Stone.  That was a great adventure movie.
56042,"Isle of Dogs, Mowgli, House with a Clock in its Walls, Alpha, Early Man, A Wrinkle in Time

There are plenty of adventure movies being made.  They just don't fill the huge-event-tentpole anymore, being replaced by supers and more adult/action/sexy franchises like F&F."
56043,Go see The Kid Who Would be King. It's bombing while you're not seeing it.
56044,Anyone remember Willow?
56045,"Mine are the great WWII adventure stuff from the 60s and 70s.

The Guns of Navarone 

Where Eagles Dare 

Kelly's Heroes

The Great Escape 

The Dirty Dozen 

For my money it doesn't get any better than those."
56046,"I watched the Great Escape last night. Arguably the best ensemble cast in the history of film, I think."
56047,Where Eagles Dare is a fantastic film!
56048,I had a friend who was convinced that [their theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XKGhG0W0LQ&t=0m42s) was the same as that used in [Monty Python and the Holy Grail.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHDycUXzNs0&t=1m28s)  (They're not.)
56050,"Also, The Train."
56051,"POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl

The Great Mouse Detective if we're also counting animation"
56052,The first Pirates still hold up really well
56053,"I liked the characters we were introduced to and the ghost pirates. 

Honestly the sequels started to get confusing, with characters seemingly betraying each other. I liked how Davy Jones looked, but wasn't the biggest fan of the character itself.

The score for CotBP is great, the only one I think is better would be At World's End."
56054,"Off the top of my head, **Raiders of The Lost Ark.**"
56055,Last Crusade was cool too
56056,"True, true. But Raiders is better, imo. And as far as ""Jones Girls"" go, Marion is better than Elsa, imo.

EDIT: I was talking about character-wise. Elsa is pretty bland, when compared to Marion."
56057,Absolutely. Raiders is far and ahead the best of the series
56058,"I'm sure some will disagree but I prefer Temple of Doom over Last Crusade. A lot of people put Crusade above Doom but I feel that's mostly because they want the same thing out of an Indiana Jones film. Crusade is a little too much ""Raiders 2.0"" for me. I like how Doom changed things up.

Temple of Doom is so great, not quite as good as Raiders, but still a blast. It has some of the best set pieces (the opening, mine cart chase, rope bridge), I love the creepy cult vibe instead of recycling Nazi's, short round and Willie are really funny (she's supposed to be irritating, which makes it more amusing when Indy gets pissed at her), and a dude gets his heart pulled out through his chest! Shit is awesome. Last Crusade is a lot of fun and I love it as well but it feels like a sitcom version of Raiders."
56059,"I like Temple of Doom. It's honestly about even with Last Crusade for me. But Raiders is still the best, to me."
56060,"I liked Last Crusade > Temple of Doom > Raiders

in that order"
56061,Clearly.

56064,Big trouble is an all time fave of mine
56065,"Oh God, Romancing the Stone for sure."
56066,"Big Trouble in Little China is an example of a near-perfect movie IMO.

For pure adventure, Tintin outshines Spielberg's other work."
56067,Raiders of the Lost Ark has no equal.
56068,I thought John Carter was a lot of fun

56070,I do really enjoy the National Treasure films
56071,"Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans (not the CGI remake bullshit) are two of my favourites.

In Jason i have always loved that they make a big deal about Hercules and then halfway through he just up and leaves. Its unconventional storytelling and i love it."
56072,"The original [Clash of the Titans](http://manapop.com/film/clash-of-the-titans-1981-from-myth-to-movie/) does have a lot of charm, and certainly better that the [shit remake](http://manapop.com/film/clash-of-the-titans-2010-review/), but it did play pretty fast and loose with Greek mythology."
56073,"Some of these have probably been mentioned already, but I might as well add my list.  In my opinion Hollywood does not make nearly enough movies in this genre.

56088,"The Adventures of Robin Hood. I could watch it at any time and be elated. In fact I would dare someone to watch it and not crack a grin at least once. It would be damn near impossible. The film truly represents everything wonderful about cinema. Dashing heroes, swashbuckling, duels, and romance. It's no wonder this film was shown at the end of Cinema Paradiso. When someone says ""Film"" I think of The Adventures of Robin Hood."

56129,Hardcore Henry
56130,Well already beat me to it.
56131,Dredd 3D. Very very underrated.
56132,"That movie deserved better. I understand why people skipped it, though. The promotion and advertising repelled me back in the day, but when I finally put it on out of curiosity one day, I was blown away. It wasn't high art, but it was better than most other action flicks back then. At least it's getting some recognition, now."
56133,Free Fire

Gravity


see it in 3D if you can.  it's an experience.   it's the only ""3d""ing i do with my TV, but it's worth it.  others are a gimmick,  Gravity in 3D is like a ride."

But I’d also add

Live Free or Die Hard

The Way of the Gun

Man on Fire

Unstoppable 

Deepwater Horizon

Transformers Dark of the Moon 

Die Hard"
56147,Bourne movies!
56148,Not so much the first one or the one with Jeremy Renner but the middle 2 are absolutely action packed from start to finish
56149,I felt The Lighthouse was tense from start to finish dunno if that can be classed
56150,It certainly was tense but I’m more thinking of action movies with totally unrealistic set pieces where the main guy or girl just unlikely survives every blow and keeps on going.
56151,Aliens
56152,"A lot of these suggestions are great action movies, but still have some areas of “rest.” Crank and Crank 2 are really the only ones that don’t stop. Especially Crank 2. 

Honorable mention though: once the first murder happens, Green Room doesn’t really let up until the end credits."
56153,Not an action movie but definitely relentless. Uncut gems!
56154,"*King Kong* (2005). No other movie has the level of anxiety inducing tension and non-stop peril like this one. 

Jackson stacked four major action scenes one after the other. Each one more risky and treacherous than the one before it, a real chore to sit through."
56155,"Uncut Gems defo one of those for me

Edit: idk why people disagree but I really do think it doesn't let up. Maybe not an action movie as most other suggestions but still."

56162,"I just watched Underwater, and that would fit your bill."
56163,Apocalypto of course. I wish Mel Gibson made more action movies in this style.
56164,Not sure if this counts but I felt this way about 1917. The whole movie takes place over a couple of days and the whole time you are just IN IT. The fact that it's shot to all look like a single take lends to this. It feels like you are watching continuous motion with no interruption which makes it feel very real and in the moment if that makes any sense.
56165,Oh yeah that’s a good one actually. Thanks! 👍
56166,"Kiss of the Dragon, with Jet Li.
There are very few spots in the film where he's not kicking someones ass. And all those spots are Bridget Fonda sucking at acting.

Watch it for Jet Li."
56167,Terminator 2. Right from the get go it's non stop action. Basically a 2 and a half chase movie
