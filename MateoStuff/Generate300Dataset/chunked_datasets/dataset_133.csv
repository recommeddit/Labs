42683,"I also loved Broadchurch and The Bridge - I will definitely take a look at your list, thanks for the tips!

&#x200B;

Maybe you will enjoy these ones too (british and scandinavian productions):

River. Happy Valley. Bordertown. Bodyguard. Occupied."
42763,The mentalist
42685,Safe starring Michael C Hall is pretty good. It’s on Netflix.
42686,Numb3rs
42687,Dark
42688,"I thought I will get some nice ideas too but then I saw ""Altered Carbon"" at the top the best comments...
Now I am questioning all the suggestions"
42690,"Not on Netflix, but the Korean show [Signal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(South_Korean_TV_series))  might fit the bill."
42691,"Murder in the First on Hulu with Kathleen Robertson and Tyne Daly. I really liked it because a case wasn’t solved in one epi, but lasted the whole season. I’d never heard of it before I ran across it on Hulu, but I really enjoyed it."
42692,"Person Of interest. Honestly one of my favourite series ever, especially relevent these days with all that's come out about mass surveillance."
42693,"""If-Then-Else"" is one of my favorite episodes of TV, ever."
42694,"Dexter is kind of a detective series.  Not my favorite, but definitely worth a watch...atleast through season 4."
42695,Shetland is good. Happy Valley. Foyle’s  War. Currently I’m watching DCI Banks which is also good.
42696,Seven seconds
42697,Has nobody recommended line of duty?
42698,I love hinterlands.. so moody and scenic.
42699,"Southcliffe. Underrated UK drama. If you liked Broadchurch, definitely watch this."
42700,"Bosch is pretty solid on Amazon.

He and Rust Cohle would earn a spot on my Detective Dream Team roster."
42701,Mindhunter
42702,"Ripper Street. Great early 20th century crime drama.

There is a secondary game when watching of spot the Game of Thrones actor."
42703,Longmire?
42704,Bosch! On Amazon Prime. Love the main character. Love everything about it.
42705,Definitely the Wire.
42706,"Criminal minds. It’s more of an FBI investigation series and the format can be a little repetitive, but I still liked it"
42707,"Love international crime shows as well:

Hanna (series not movie).

Top of the Lake.

The Bodyguard (UK series).

The Guilty (great movie Denmark I think).

The Night Of.

Not crime per se but fantastic anyway:

Big Little Lies.

Westworld.

Handmaid’s Tale."
42708,Top of the Lake was fantastic.
42709,The Following
42710,I'm curious as to your list. Lots I haven't seen. Are these in order of your favorite? Because I loved manhunt and Mindhunters...I wanna use ur list as a guide
42711,">The sinner

The rest of the list is not in any kind of order, but I'd say that if you liked Manhunt as a proper detective, you definitely need to watch Broadchurch, The Killing (the original series is danish, but american version is amazing as well), Broen is a swedish/danish detective with amazing plot twists, and I'd also add Deadwind, it's a rather exotic one, because it's from Finland. Hope you like it. :)"
42712,Thank you...I have seen the killing..I loved season 1 of the sinner hated season 2 thought they shoulda just kept it a mini series.
42713,Where can you watch the original killing series in Danish? I was looking for it and all that I came up with was the American version. Thanks
42714,I finished season 1 of Broadchurch because a lot of people say it’s a good crime mystery show but what was that??? What exactly did he do?? He didn’t solve anything AT ALL
42715,"I felt Broadchurch was just too slow for me to really enjoy.

But seen recommended on Reddit in the past so maybe more unique to me."
42716,"If you're good with some humor/satire, American Vandal is surprisingly well done. It's got a lot of laughs, but a genuinely compelling mystery throughout. Also, a good amount of social commentary."
42717,"Some great suggestions here. My favourites: line of duty, bodyguard, the fall, the sinner, the missing

Edit: typo"
42718,"Not a detective series, but the best series I’ve ever seen is The Americans."
42719,"Watching the last episode right now, haha"
42720,"Nice! I was sad when I was done w/the series because it was so good! I really liked Goliath, the Fall was pretty good, the Night Of, Sinner season 1."
42721,One of my favorites.    Loved it.
42722,"The bridge (subtitled) 
River 
Department q."
42723,Criminal minds is the best crime/thriller show keeps you into it and it has 12 seasons on Netflix
42724,Fallet is weird but good. I'm halfway through Undercover and it has been enjoyable. Bordertown is another you may want to try. Bron/Bridge was the best.
42725,broadchurch
42726,"TAKEN

An Icelandic Broadchurch."
42727,You mean Ófærð?
42728,"Monk, it's on amazin prime"
42729,"Did not read thread, forgive me if this has been mentioned.

John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series.
You'll know them by the colors in the titles.

Super fun to read, it was a different time."
42730,Criminal Minds
42731,The Mysteries of Laura
42732,7 seconds kind of fits the bill. I'm about to watch it again.
42733,Silent Witness is a great British series. Worth checking out if you can get it.
42734,High Seas
42735,You will definitely like Unforgotten (on Prime Video)
42736,dexter!
42752,Line of Duty
42738,Broadchurch is sensational.
42739,"My mistake. TRAPPED. 

You are right.  

It's nice to see all those cute Islander cheeks like my wife's on screen."
42741,Babylon Berlin is pretty good if you don't mind that it's in German (with English subs of course)
42742,"Top of the Lake is excellent. But I think it's on Hulu right now, not Netflix.  (Only the first Top of the Lake, not the sequel series)."
42743,Hotel Beau Sejour and Tabula Rasa (this one is especially spectacular)
42744,"Based off what you listed, I’d suggest midsummer murders. And father brown. 

Can’t explain why exactly, but I’ve watched and enjoyed much of your list and I extremely enjoy both of those."
42745,The sniffer. Its a Russian tv show about a man with superhuman sense of smell who uses it to solve crimes. Really good. Also blue bloods
42746,I just watched Sandpaper and that was decent if you can get over the dubbing
42747,Currently enjoying the French/Belgian show [Black Spot](https://www.netflix.com/title/81079046) on Netflix.
42748,"Tucker and Dale vs Evil
Snowpiercer
Scott Pilgrim vs the world. 
Zombieland"
42749,Why haven’t you watched Dexter?
42750,Taboo
42977,Hannibal
42753,Blue bloods?
42754,"River is short but amazing... 
Its about a detective who tries to find the murderer of his partner (as in coworker). He has witnessed the murder and is traumatized and has a hard time coping with what happened.

Happy Valley has somewhat the same vibe as broadchurch even though the story is quite different.

If you like Sherlock, you may like Elementary. 

EDIT: Just noticed that you already watched the bridge and broadchurch, so removed those from my recommendations. Loved these series as well :)"
42755,The Killing (us version)
42756,Top of the Lake
42757,Ozark was great.
42758,"Totally different pace than the ones listed, but I love 24."
42759,"Lucifer.

With additional arcs to the crime solving."
42760,I liked Lucifer.
42761,That’s great! It’s always nice to know that people are cool !   I loved the series and the several twists.    It’s fun to have an unexpected ending.
42762,Case closed
42764,"Death in Paradise and MidSummer Murders. They are both on Netflix, and both pbs shows, but they are fun."
42765,BBC
42766,In the US they are on PBS.
42767,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned The Killing yet. My wife and I loved it.

&#x200B;

Edit: I see OP has already listed it. I'll keep it up anyway."
42768,Brooklyn Nine Nine
42769,The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher!
42770,I have a movie for you but you might've already seen it. Murder On The Orient Express. Sorry if you've seen it.
42771,Do you know if there will be another season?
42772,"PEAKY BLINDERS!!!! This TV show is fucking crazy, mate! Amazing show!!! I can't express how good it is. Watch it. Season 5 is coming this November I believe."
42773,"Yeap, mate, love it as well, but it isn't quite a detective :)"
42774,It's not detective but a crime/mob TV show.
42775,Death note
42776,Mindhunter and Ozark
42777,"As a Missouri native, I don't know how I forgot Ozark! Added it to the list"
42778,"Black Spot, The Break, Undercover, Unit 42, are some that come to mind. I also really liked Hotel Beau Sejour."
42779,"Never heard of any of these, I will have to check them out thanks!"
42780,Mindhunter is my favorite Netflix show
42781,Seen it! Added it to the list as well
42783,another British one! added to the list
42784,I really enjoyed River. And it’s a short series.
42785,"Seen it! Crazy twist at the end, I loved it."
42786,"... Breaking Bad seems like it should make the grade.

And is The Wire on Netflix?  (I think it's on Amazon Prime)"
42787,"Better Than Us should be on the list. Even though it's not English and kind of sci Fi, it does fit in as a crime drama as far as I'm concerned and I really enjoyed it."
42788,"Woow its Russian, that's interesting. I will add it to the list!"
42789,Money Heist (Ive only seen one or two episodes but all the reviews point to it warranting inclusion here)
42790,"I've heard a lot about this from my Spanish speaking friends, I'll add it to the list!"
42791,how did you forget breaking bad lol and also triplefrontier
42792,USA Network had some great ones back in the day: Monk and Psyche. Both were smart and funny detective shows with endearing characters. I still get excited when a new Psyche movie comes out.
42793,"Prodigal son fits this for most the episodes (although it also has a long arching story)
Criminal minds for a large majority of the episodes as well."
42794,Thanks prodigal son seems to be just what I was looking for. Criminal minds is way too long though
42795,"Just be aware it is a prematurely canceled series, there is a drive to get the next season airing on a new platform though!"
42796,I love prodigal son! You should go for it OP! :)
42797,"Not sure but maybe:

Numb3rs

Unforgettable

Body Of Proof

Lie To Me

Perception"
42798,"Murder she wrote

Edit: Scooby doo"
42799,"Columbo in that same vein
Matlock as well"
42800,"Elementary   
Izombie"
42801,"Columbo.  It's an older show, but it *absolutely* holds up.  Each episode is 90min and completely standalone - really more like a made-for-tv movie."
42802,Maybe Lucifer?
42803,Mentalist
42804,Second this
42805,"CSI, they are all pretty good and the long background story is pretty cool too.

It has a wide range of characters and their development thought-out the series is pretty unique. Gibbs, fucking Gibbs. He's just, well, it's Gibbs."
42806,Death in Paradise
42807,"Castle 

Mentalist 

White collar 

Black list"
42808,The OG Law & Order
42809,And Special victims unit
42810,"Jonathan creek , some cases may extend to 2 or 3 episodes"
42811,"Poirot  (Agatha Christie)

Also Bones and Castle if you like team crime procedurals."
42812,"""Poirot"" with David Suchet"
42813,THE MENTALIST
42814,"Monk and Psych both have strong comedic elements.

These are old school but easy to find:

Perry Mason (old B&W 1 hour episodes are amazingly well written and acted)

Columbo (90 minutes)

Matlock

Murder She Wrote"
42815,"If you are cool with teen dramas, I actually love CW's Nancy Drew. It's got a paranormal aspect to it.

Psych was awesome too. And iZombie too."

42824,Unnatural is an amazing show about forensic pathologists. No romance iirc.
42825,looks interesting. thanks!
42826,"Japan loves crime/mystery/cop dramas and there's usually several to choose from every season.  Here are just a few examples (that don't include romance).  

 - Keiji Yugami - excellent cop series but has some ""drama"" in the sense that the relationship between the two cops is important to the story.  No romance though.  
 - Shinzanmono - A slightly weird, loner cop arrives in a new neighborhood to uncover the ""truth"" behind certain crimes.  
 - SP (Security Police) - Lots of action/combat. Mystery drama about a policeman working security detail with an unusual sixth sense type of ability solving the mystery behind a terrorist like organization.  
 - Kurokochi - A serial drama telling a fictionalized story about solving the (real life) unsolved 1968, 300 Million Yen robbery.
 - Joker Yurusarezaru Sosakan  
 - Strawberry Night (the original with Takeuchi Yuko, not the remake with Nikaido Fumi)   
 - Sniffer - Man with super smelling abilities solves crimes.  
 - Lucky Seven - A not-as-serious in tone detective series.  High budget, all star cast though.  
 - Smoking Gun - Like Lucky Seven, not as serious in tone
 - Kagi no Kakatta Heya - A light, mystery of the week show about sealed room murders.   
 - Nazotoki wa Dinner no Ato de - a very light, comedy mystery so maybe not what you're looking for.  
 - Unfair - A loner female cop chasing a serial murderer.  

If you don't mind long running episodic dramas (eg: CSI, Law and Order etc) then Aibou is a long running (currently on season 18 or so) and very popular drama with no romance.  It's the best quality of this type and features several specials every season and has also spawned several movies.  

Keiji 7-nin is another one of the better long running (currently season 7) episodic cop dramas. 

There are also several similar dramas that aren't operating at the same budget level as Aibou but none the less do well in the ratings like Kasouken no Onna (currently on season 19)."
42827,woah. thank you very much for the long list you gave! my searches actually led me to aibou but i was overwhelmed by the number of episodes lol. i guess i'll start from the specials or the movies first and i'll go from there. thanks again!
42828,Ouroboros!
42829,a detective and a yakuza. what a weird combination lol. i'll check it out. thanks!
42830,The plot’s really interesting. I haven’t finished season 2 though but seems that interesting too.
42831,How are the Code Blue series and movie?
42832,"- Shinzanmono 
- Karamazov no kyodai 
- Kagi no kakatta Heya 
- Siren (there's some romance but the crime/mystery part was very interesting)
- Majo Saiban"
42833,Cold Case 😁
42834,I loved Miss Sherlock. Watched it via HBO here in the states.
42835,i watched miss sherlock already and I liked it as well! I like the different perspective it gave to the traditional sherlock.
42836,"Yami no Bansosha Season 1 & 2

Mozu Season 1 & 2

Maou"
42837,yami no bansosha intrigues me. thanks a lot!
42838,Another vote for Mindhunter.
42839,Mindhunter was really really good. That show stayed with me for a long time after it was over. I wish it wasn’t cancelled! I wanted to know what was going to happen with the detective’s adopted son.
42840,"From what I understand they were released from contract for other obligations until they were ready to re-up for season 3. It hasn’t been officially cancelled, but also hasn’t been officially slated. Idk if that makes any difference but it gives me a small amount of hope. That was one of the best series I’ve ever watched!"
42841,Same! Netflix goat series imo
42842,It's a shame they cancelled it yet there's still tons of shitty $5 Walmart movie bin productions getting put out.
42844,"Nope, last I heard, it's completely cancelled."
42845,Dang it really is sad girl summer
42846,I’m so bummed about that..

42849,I'm so on board with this list - agree 100%. The jinx was so insanely good I actually binge watched the whole series in one sitting on two separate occasions. The twists are unreal!
42850,"Yep this list plus a couple of addition from the shows I binged watched for the last 4 months, all documentaries tho.

(1)Abducted in plain site
(2)The keepers
(3)God knows where I am
(4)FYRE(the Netflix one) 
(5)Wild wild country
(6)Tickled
(7)Tell me who I am
(8)Dear Zachary
(9)The great Hack"
42851,Those are all EXCELLENT True Crime docs! Good choices! Especially The Jinx and the bathroom hot mic scene!
42852,"I must agree!!! You forgot the staircase, it’s amazing too!"
42853,I felt like I wasted my time watching making a Murder even though it was good. They twisted a lot of information to fit their story.
42854,That’s what cops and lawyers do. This story was told from the perspective of the lawyers/defenders of Avery fam.
42855,"Watched the “Cats” series and fortunately it moves slowly enough that one has time to ff through the worst parts, the parts you know you’ll never be able to remove from your brain once you’ve seen them. Query: did they actually show it? Or was it blurred out? Just knowing what was happening was bad enough."
42856,"No, they never really showed anything, thank god"
42857,Don’t Fuck With Cats is too long.
42858,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Spoilers:

They glanced over the fact that they drove the wrong guy to suicide and those wannabe Sherlock internet detectives still kept investigating. Then they try to shame the audience at the end for watching their documentary. One of the worst documentaries I've ever seen."
42859,"I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it, but had no idea about the suicide. It's fucked up that they left it out. Talk about bias!

That's the thing that has turned me off if documentaries. You have to tell the whole unbiased truth or it's just a propaganda piece. I started to watch the one about the former tight end for the NE Patriots, but I'm worried that it is more fan fiction than a serious documentary. it seems like everyone wants to play fast and loose with the truth these days. I'm not saying this particular show did anything wrong, I just don't trust them to tell the truth. I shouldn't have to fact check a show after I watch it."
42860,"Yeah I have the same issue with true crime docs, but I research everything after so I have a better idea of the true story.  That's why I like sports docs the most because even if they are seeped in bias, at the end of the day its just sports."
42861,"They didn't leave that out at all, I just watched it."
42862,"I personally thought the first episode was super interesting. The second episode was alright and the final episode would pretty generic like any other crime documentary I've ever seen. That being said, the ending is wack as fuck like you said. Bitch, I am not responsible for you accidentally getting the wrong guy and for some psycho being a psycho on the internet."
42863,Would highly suggest people to watch it and judge for yourself. It's not even close to being one of the worst documentaries on Netflix. It was super hyped when it first came out and was overall a very interesting series.
42864,I didnt think so
42865,"But you can stop if you don't want to watch it more, the problem is that probably you wouldn't want to stop watching"
42866,"Netflix:
The pharmacist
The sinner
Mind hunter
The killing

Showtime:
Outcry

HBO:
True detective"
42867,ugh. the killing was so good. love me some joel kinnaman
42868,"True Crime: Dirty John, Unbelievable. 
Fiction: Broadchurch.

And I agree with Mad Men. Watched it while it was still running, and rewatched the whole thing on Netflix. Jon Hamm deserved that long-overdue Emmy."
42869,"I checked Netflix and they’re not on there anymore, but available on other streaming services—-The Fall and The Killing are two of my top 5 fave crime shows. 

Broad church IS on Netflix, and seriously just about the best. Highly recommend."
42870,Perry Mason and I’ll be Gone in the Dark on HBO. Both are pretty great.
42871,Just finished season 1 of Bosch and really liked it! Amazon Prime.
42872,"Bosch seasons 1 - 5 are some of the best TV - EVER!! S6 is, unfortunately, surprisingly dull. Regardless, you can't lose with Bosch!"
42873,"Mindhunter

The Last Kingdom"
42874,Came here to say definitely Mindhunter.
42876,Upvoted for the BoJack mention. Anyone with a Netflix subscription *should* watch the show.
42877,"These are all phenomenal suggestions, thank you so much!! Bojack gets a bit dark for me at times, as I do struggle quite a bit with sobriety and addiction, but when I have the space to watch a few episodes, it's always worth it."
42878,"I FULLY UNDERSTAND the request here, and I normally would not suggest this given what you are asking but I fully recommend watching Dark. It may tell a sci-fi story, but god damn does it have some of the best acting and drama a Netflix show can have. 

I highly suggest giving it a shot despite the general story being based around time travel. Plenty of real world mystery and thrills to go along with the sci-fi nature of the show imo."
42879,"yes! i highly recommend DarK! even if it is a sci-fi series, it has the same thrill i get while watching true crime/drama shows, and it has the best plot twsts i've seen in any show. each episode left me mind-blown every time. 

i also love Ozark and Orphan Black (and Mindhunter, but everyone else said that too hahah)"
42880,one of my all-time favorites!!!
42881,The Americans and the sopranos are both great shows
42882,"Manhunt: UNABOMBER is a drama based on the real life hunt and capture of the UNABOMBER, Sam Worthington and Paul Bettany are fantastic"
42883,The Americans!
42884,Broadchurch is maybe the best show on US Netflix right now. It will ruin other tv for you for a bit but it’s well worth it.
42885,Broad church is really good. There is also another British crime show called Marcella that’s great and she deals with some of the “identity disorder” type storyline as well.
42886,Hyperbole much? Good lord. It's a good show but it won't ruin other TV.
42887,"Yeah. 

Also, it might just be me but no show has ever ruined another good show for me."
42888,Omg no it won't. Christ.
58050,Third!
42890,I second this.
42891,Watch The Leftovers. It's so damn complex. Pacing is medium. It's a psychological show meaning it deals with human nature. It's the most gripping show I've watched ever. Never yawned while watching it.
42892,I absolutely loved the Leftovers!!!! It’s a great series!
42893,"The series had a great start with a terrible ending imo. Totally let down. >!Going from a religious/science apocalyptic story to one that is convoluted with dream sequences based in an alter Universe was lame. Nora's alter afterlife story was told in only the last 10 minutes of the last episode - about traversing different worlds with a machine - when 50% of the entire series content was about Kevin, who ended up simply being delusional with a heart issue!< lame."
42894,Nora going to a different universe was her need for closure. She faked it but didn't fake it. Means she's lying to herself imo. It was so deep man. I loved it
42895,"Don't you think they should have spent some time with her in the other world where only the departed lived? To end it with just her very short story, and to conclude that it was all delusion, should have been explored more. The 3rd season could have eliminated some of the fluff to expand on her alter life is all I'm saying. Too much Kevin dreams."
42896,If they had shown the other universe it would've been a truth then. They left it for us to interpret. Nora needed closure just like you do. But none of you got it.
42897,"> none of you got it.

That right there alone should tell you that the script sucked. I'm all about shows that make you think long after you watch them... which every season and show did, except the final."
42898,Well it did make me think long after it was finsihed. I still think about it.
42899,"Giri/Hagi. Anglo-Japanese crime thriller that's got everything, great characters, tight plotting, and quite a lot of humor, actually. Unlike anything I've ever seen. Very highly recommended."
42900,"The Sopranos, hands down. One of the best shows ever made. Influenced Breaking bad and better call saul. if you like those shoes you will love the Sopranos. Tony Soprano is one of the most iconic tv characters ever"
42901,"got the LAST two episodes in the series left, so scared to finish it, but perhaps I'll just go ahead now"
42902,do you have hbo? hbo is the king of drama and true crime series
42903,"The Wire. It takes a few episodes to build the characters and plot, but once it’s rolling, one of my fav shows ever"
42904,I do! Didn't really care for Watchmen honestly but haven't watched much else besides GoT & Westworld on there
42905,watch season 1 of true detective
42906,Easily in my top 5 of any series. Can’t recommend it enough
42907,Season 3 was great too
42908,"Considering you liked House of Cards and Fargo, I’d recommend Succession, a comedy-drama about the concentration of power in the hands of a wealthy family. The show has some beautifully profane dialogue, hilarious and intense moments (sometimes in the same scene)."
42909,Ever seen Newsroom on HBO? First season is amazing!
42910,The Wire. Ignore everything else before you watch this. And Sopranos
42911,"Easy - ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark"""
42912,Yes. Can't recommend enough. I binged it this weekend.
42913,"I’m currently watching I’ll be gone in the dark.  Next is Perry Mason.  Another great HBO original is Six Feet Under, it is what motivated me to get into the death care industry."
42914,The Night Of on HBO
42915,Unbelievable is fantastic
42916,My wife really liked Unbelievable.
42917,That's a great show. I kept thinking about it after watching it...
42918,Yeah I didn’t actually watch it. But my wife was telling me about it and she had only good things to say.
42919,True detective and mindhunter
42920,True Detective Series 1
42921,"Series 1 is top notch amazing! But this is one of those shows that you only want to watch the first season. While there are others, they pale in comparison."
42922,Repeated a bunch but Mindhunter
42923,"The Bridge / The Tunnel,
Happy Valley,
Line of Duty"
42924,"To put two foreign shows into the mix:

Signal 

&

Chicago Typewriter"
42925,"How to Get Away With Murder is great! Six seasons, phenomenonal writing and acting"
42926,"Actually started this back in college and loved it, not sure why i fell off\~ thanks for reminding me :D"
42927,Because it got really stupid?
42928,yeah i agree it was good in the first 2 or 3 seasons then they really started dragging things out. This latest season seems like a CW show. its like dumb drama i couldnt get past the second episode. they should have ended it at 5 or something in my opinion.
42929,"‘The Keepers’ and ‘Wild, Wild County’ for true crime insanity.

Also, if you’re into podcasts, try ‘Bear Creek’"
42930,"TRUE DETECTIVE (1ST SEASON)

Trust me. I would say this is better than Breaking Bad and I've watched a lot of TV, but that's just my opinion."
42931,"Criminal minds (is kind of formulaic but this series is sooo good and some fo the episodes are actually based on true stories)

Brooklyn nine nine

Black sails

Prison break

Goliath

Breaking bad 

Schitts creek

Dexter

White collar

The mentalist
Others that don’t really fit with your taste but are still excellent:

Supernatural (if you need an investment , this is it)

This is us

The boys 

The umbrella academy"
42932,BLACK SAILS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
42933,I mean if true detective isn’t on this list ..
42934,"Definitely check out Evil Genius on Netflix and The Jinx on HBO. The latter was really crazy in that there was some follow-up craziness in real time as the show came out and as a result of what the show revealed, which was nuts to behold. Won't have the same impact now but the story itself is crazy.

Drama-wise, definitely check out Breaking Bad, The Sopranos and The Wire if you haven't already. All absolutely top notch TV. And by that I mean arguably the best of all time."
42935,"Seen all 3 of the latter suggestions--have two episodes of the Sopranos left; I'm scared to finish it and not ready to let go of Tony. That being said, I will likely finish it off this week, before I forget what's going on."
42937,Agree! It was so good!
42938,"I just started Endeavour, and have been enjoying it so far. It’s about a detective in Oxford, a prequel to Inspector Morse. Mindhunter is wonderful. Criminal Minds is great is you want a long series to watch. If you’re looking for some comedy, Brooklyn 99 and The Good Place are both fantastic and always makes my mood brighter."
42939,bro watch BBC sherlock. Its not true crime but nevertheless was a good watch
42940,I’m not sure if you’ve watched this yet but I really like broadchurch. It’s only 3 seasons but it’s super engaging and really good
42941,"Check out Wentworth, Australian prison drama series. Seven seasons, 8th out soon. Exciting with lots of twists and unexpected occurrences."
42942,"Had it bookmarked for years, but should really start on it soon, thanks for the reminder, I'll have to bump it up the queue. Didn't know it was 7 seasons deep, definitely an encouraging factor for me at the moment!!"
42943,Penny dreadful
42944,"You say you want True Crime but then you don't list any True Crime shows...

I Am A Killer is a great docuseries. It deals with the overarching question of the existence of the Death Penalty and whether death sentences are always justified, but unlike a lot of true crime out there, there's no narration or interviewer telling you what to think. Each episode is structured carefully so that information about each crime is revealed in a way that creates a compelling story and challenges your preconceived ideas about the crime.

In a lot of True Crime shows the murder remains unsolved, but in this show we know who the murderer is and we get to see interviews with them and understand where their head was at, as well as who they are as a person now, so it is a really interesting look at whether or not rehabilitation is possible."
42945,"Unbelievable, an incredible story of how two female detectives tracked down a serial rapist and vindicated  one of his victims who was pressured by police to say she made it all up."
42946,I finished good girls on Netflix. Amazing show.
42947,A great show for class struggle: 3%.
42948,"The Bridge (Bron) on Hulu is amazing, the original Swedish version. Character development, twists, social commentary, 3 long seasons. If you can find the original Danish version of The Killing as well, it is well worth it."
42949,Part way through Perry Mason it’s been wonderful so far
42950,Weeds!  (seriously one of my favourites).  I know it's on Amazon Prime
42951,"Black Spot, french show about a detective in a small town, very moody setting"
42952,Giri/haji - I’m only on episode 5 but it’s been great and definitely worth giving a shot! Japanese murder mystery/thriller taking place in japan and London
42953,If you have Amazon Prime you might really enjoy the show Unforgotten based on what you described. It focuses on a team that solves murders that happened decades ago based on recently discovered remains. Each season focuses on solving one case. It’s excellently acted and ends up being very personal/emotional due to the way the main characters treat each case. I’d say it’s similar to Broadchurch in tone and style. Probably my favorite crime show.
42954,"Not technically true crime but..... 

The Americans (FX Now) 

Breaking Bad (Netflix) 

***both of these compelling series will draw you in like Mad Men; THE BEST **** 

Also the Keepers (Netflix)  is the most enthralling true crime documentary I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched it twice. 

I think Babylon Berlin is one of the more under appreciated shows in Netflix. Loved it! 

I just started Dark thanks to this sub and I’ll have to add Broadchurch to the list next!"
42955,"Dark truly floored me and even while working 55 hours a week in Jan-March, I bingewatched it all in about two weeks, so glad you started it!!"
42956,Ok update it is so good that there is no resistance to binging !
42957,"Go with Criminal on Netflix. Few settings. England, Germany... intersting concept. 
Also Collateral on Netflix."
42958,"There's a documentary called The trial of Gabriel Fernandez. If you haven't seen it yet, you totally should
It's dark twisted haunting and lots of trigger warnings but def worth the watch"
42959,Such a sad story. I couldn't believe how so many people let that poor baby down...😥
42960,"I highly recommend:
The Missing and Happy Valley"
42961,Noticed Breaking bad wasn’t on your list but better call Saul is. If you haven’t seen BB I’d recommend it! It’s really good. If you have seen it then you already know how good it is
42962,"Fortitude. Not on Netflix but Amazon Prime. Filmed in Reyðarfjörður, **Iceland**. Besides being a great mystery with an interesting plot, it's rare to see how people in that far flung environment live."
42964,"This...sounds so incredible, thank you so much. Hunting this one down right now."
42965,"The Fall, Fortitude"
42966,I'll Be Gone In The Dark   --    is a recent miniseries on the Golden State Killer.  It's on HBO and it's scary as fuck.
42967,"u/Rain_OnWeekends There are a ton of good recommendations in the comments. A couple true crime docs that I didn't see in the comments that are very good and on Netflix; The Confession Tapes, The Confession Killer, The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, The Staircase, The Ted Bundy Tapes, The Innocent Man, Amanda Knox, Trial by Media, World's Most Wanted (Excellent and just came out on Netflix!), Unabomber In His Own Words, Fear City (about the Mob and just came out on Netflix), Long Shot, Tell Me Who I Am, How To Fix a Drug Scandal, WACO, Wormwood, and another one that just came out on Netflix and was extremely well made is TREAD. 

There are quite a few more I could say but I think I listed enough. These are all on Netflix currently as well! Enjoy!"
42968,"Luther, The Killing, Broadchurch - Netflix

The Unforgotten, The ABC Murders - Prime Video"
42969,The Fall is excellent. Have just binged it.
42970,"This might not be what you are looking for and depending on how you feel about subtitles but just in case- ""Caliphate"" (Kalifat original title) Drama/Thriller 8.2/10 on imbd. Still a new series but so far rottentomatoes says Fresh with an average rating of 4.63"
42971,"Watch Trapped on prime. Set in iceland, gradually unfolding mystery."
42972,Sounds incredible!!! Will have to put it on my list
42973,If you're able to find it streaming (it used to be on Netflix CAN at least) The Fall (2013)
42974,"Since you mentioned Black Mirror, I gotta throw out for Inside No. 9. I got it from a subreddit recommendation list myself. It's INCREDIBLE. Definitely more of a comedic twist than Black Mirror, but a great show that I binged really hard."
42975,"Some of these have already been mentioned, but here are few off the top of my head that I can watch over and over: Wallander, Broadchurch, Happy Valley, Six Feet Under, Luther, The Fall, The Killing, Top of the Lake"
42976,"It's not really the ""crime"" genre but try Chernobyl"
42978,"True Detective and Sharp Objects, crime/suspenseful dramas on HBO. They’re both incredible!"
42979,How To Get Away With Murder. period.
42980,Person of Interest is really good! On Netflix.
42981,"Occupied--a Norwegian series about Russian invasion, politics, crime
Lillyhammer-former mafia guy enters witness protection and goes to Norway. Shenanigans ensue"
42982,"Cold Case Files on Netflix. Also The Most Hated Woman in America. If you like podcasts, My Favorite Murder always has great recommendations for true crime and fictional crime documentaries and shows."
42983,Bosch on Amazon Prime! It’s amazing
42984,"Not on Netflix but I was so surprised how this thing ended. This guy duct taped his ex wife, stuffed her head first in a trash can and put her in their storage unit. Thank god for good cops. The 911 operator on the other hand should be publicly called out. https://youtu.be/XfwQlqXfKQg"
42985,"Hell on Wheels was much better than I expected.  Longmire starts off kinda cheesy, but picks up in later seasons after Netflix took over."
42986,mindhunter
42987,"Some suggetions:  
  

* Orphan Black
* Lucifer
* Killing Eve
* Rick & Morty
* Money Heist
* Bodyguard
* Daredevil
* The Boys
* Umbrella Academy"
42988,Definitely Fringe
42989,I'm watching west wing for the first time right now and it's really good
42990,"*I'm watching west wing*

*For the first time right now and*

*It's really good*
