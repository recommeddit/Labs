20141,"Personally, it's ""The Trooper"" by Iron Maiden. That pumps me up whenever I hear it."
20142,"Great choice. 

I like Aces High for the beginning of my workouts because it has a nice buildup."
20143,Any song by Iron Maiden can make you feel like a fucking Viking during a work out
20144,"Aces High was the first Maiden song I've heard, and the Trooper the first that I learned on guitar. They've been my favorite band ever since"

20159,[Salt in the Wounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phQW1fXmVfc) is my go-to. The tempo just keeps going up and up until I'm sprinting. The Island pt 2 is another good one.
20160,Pendulum Island Part I & II is my shiiiiiit
20161,"In response to this, just gotta say [Slam](https://youtu.be/gIOQfdn9L9c) for the video."
20162,"just pendulum music in general, really. Slam, Hold Your Colour, Showdown, The Tempest, Crush, etc."
20163,"Creating a [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/1yMpG4sJgr6GNjzQvegTwQ) as quick as I can

Edit: I'm also creating playlists for separate genres, here's one for [electronic](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/11s2gGCARi3X0fjCDoCt3f) and one for [hip-hop](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/3MIy8BfJhB1iIIdBIzyQSS), with rock, metal, and pop coming soon! If you believe I'm missing anything from a specific genre feel free to tell me!

Edit 2: I now have separate [metal](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/37eU3A2VdXn5YnPqfzXDaK), [punk](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/7zhmdssrIgx0dmBRrPDMFr), [pop](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/6qcGS3HaFC90xIYmIqIsmx), and [R&B/Soul/Funk](https://open.spotify.com/user/jaredcub/playlist/320hmxgW9uBpXDg7jmYs29) playlists."
20164,Oh no not this again.
20165,Wait what did I do
20166,"About a week ago a thread was on /r/music about listing good songs.

One guy made a Spotify playlist of them all.  He got gilded 7 times.  The next day he trolled everyone by changing the entire playlist to just loop the Friends theme 20 times.

Needless to say, there were many a pissed off redditor.

Funny as shit though."
20167,"This is fantastic

I'm gonna try my best to fight off the urge to do this"
20168,Everyone will see it coming if you do though.  Not much point in copying a joke like that.  But hey do what you gotta do.
20169,"Damn. I'm 7 hours late to this party. This will probably get buried, but this is my EDM playlist for my first marathon coming up! This is what I've been training and listening to for the past few months.

20170,Welcome Home - Coheed and Cambria
20171,"YES!

Pretty much any song but I think I would start with In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3."
20172,"I second this.  
  
Also: The Crowing, Delirium Trigger, Everything Evil, Gravemakers & Gunslingers, The Willing Well I - Fuel For the Feeding End, The Willing Well II - From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness, and Sentry The Defiant.  
  
Let's all just take a moment to reflect on Claudio's badass song-naming"
20173,ten speed of gods blood and burial
20174,"holy shit coheed and cambria. haven't thought about that band in forever until just now. 

*re-downloads albums onto iphone*"
20175,Killing in the name - rage against the machine
20176,"Doesn't work if you do fitness DVD's as I found out. 

*""Alright gang, let's get down to plank position and hold it for 30 secon-""*

#FUCKYOUIWON'TDOWHATYOUTELLME"
20177,"I always interpreted it as not doing what my body tells me, which is to cease all movement and sit down for a while. 

""hey buddy, this is calves and lungs, why not sit down and take a breather?""

""FUCK YOU I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!"""
20178,Rage Against the Lactic Acid
20179,"Can vouch for this. Jogged 5 miles yesterday to RATM. When the bridge hit for ""Killing In The Name"" around mile 4, I can tell you despite my side cramps and sore calves, I sprinted the entire duration of that bit. My body can eat a dick for being a pussy like that."
20180,"> My body can eat a dick for being a pussy like that.

Words to live by"
20181,"I used to run a 4-mile circuit every other day that included my own version of 'heartbreak hill.'  Struggled with it mightily until the day that song game on right before I hit the hill, and the good part kicked in halfway through.  Ended up sprinting up the hill and finishing the run super-strong.  

After that I carefully edited every playlist of mine to include that song at just the right time, and the days I screwed it up by going too fast or slow, I performed much worse on the hill.  Never thought the music I listened to would matter during a workout until then."
20182,I prefer calm like a bomb. That intro.
20183,Intro? Sleep now in the fire FTW
20184,Takes to long to get going. I like to put Bulls on Parade on when I need some extra motivation for a big set.
20185,"My go-to choices are [The Prodigy - Smack My Bitch Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoURQz1_c0U) NSFW, [Motorhead - The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JF8oSxXtM) and the montage theme by [Vince Dicola for Rocky IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuzZmWVNlkQ)."
20186,"King of kings is also a great song by Motörhead when you're looking to ""bury"" your sets ;)"
20187,Parkway Drive - Sleepwalker
20188,"Literally anything by Parkway Drive

Wild Eyes is pretty prime too"
20189,"Gods gonna cut you down - Johnny Cash

The beat of the song is perfect for running. I don't know why but something about that song really just gives me the chills and amps me the fuck up"
20190,Number 1: Roy Jones - Can't Be Touched ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoCOg8ZzUfg
20191,Use the boxing vid. http://youtu.be/KPU5qFJAJGg
20192,"Inanimate Sensation by Death Grips, I can't help but push myself really hard when I hear that song."
20193,"Honestly, their whole discog can be used as workout playlist"
20194,"And it is, by me."
20195,Same here.
20196,Pantera - Cowboys from Hell
20197,Anything by Pantera is perfect for working out IMO.
20198,"I don't know man, to me Floods is more of a ""let's shoot some heroine and see what happens"" kinda song."
20199,"**Final Edit** (Maybe)

After many requests, I did it. [Here's the 158 song playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKTm4sjQQBKz8erwS2_lvVxf5uEa9zpgc). I know there are some others from other users, which is awesome, but I kept adding more stuff. So this is it, I'm not adding anything else. It's been a blast everyone!

I ran out of space, so bonuses beyond 8 (acapella rap, kpop, motivation speeches, and two lists from /u/PretendstoKnowThings) can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3iqbpk/what_is_your_1_workout_song/cuj4rc9)

Just going to compile some of the listed songs with links, because nobody is doing that. A couple people have also been kind enough to make Youtube and Spotify playlists. Some are probably missing a few songs, since I'm updating every twenty minutes or so, but you should be able to get most of it if you dig through the comments!

[This is my favorite nightcore song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Fg7KSJDK8) but if you’re mainly into hip hop I doubt you’ll like this sub genre. It’s super fast paced sped-up music (so it also is generally accompanied by a high pitched voice)."
20349,"This sounds absolutely terrible and disgusting, but I’m willing to listen to it for one full workout"
20350,I slowly transitioned from rap to edm over the years. Sometimes I’ll play nightcore in the car without thinking and my friends are like “wtf bro this is the worst music I’ve heard in my entire life” 😂😂
20351,"relatable af

like when you're at a homeparty and plug your aux in, then 10 songs into your playlist the opening to naruto shipudden season 2 starts playing and you can't make it quick enough to your phone"
20352,"Was always wondering what this genre was called, it's what they used for DDR, right?"
20353,"I’ll check it out regardless, thanks!"
20354,Night core is my go to cardio music. So bouncy & upbeat & definitely pretty gay. Love it though
20355,"Lmao it’s so gay 😂😂

Recently started dating this girl and when I played it for the first time she’s thought I was joking. I had to play like 5 songs for her to believe I actually listen to it."
20356,"I have yet to meet another person in real life who listens to it. Or maybe everyone listens and we’re all to embarrassed to admit we do lmao. 

What was her reaction after listening?"
20357,She doesn’t like when I play it in the car. I couldn’t resist and played a few songs last week and she was like I still can’t believe you listen to this. I feel like this is some long running joke
20358,"Hahaha yeah I get that. The only person I can play nightcore around is my sister and that’s only because we like to have crazy car dance parties. Personally, I love blasting it in the car, especially on long car trips!"
20359,"yes I like to listen to robot fucking noises on max volume. I'm no expert on subgenres but hardstep maybe? just high energy beat heavy robot yelling, thats my jam."
20360,"Is hardstep the same as hardstyle? Hardstyle is great fistbumping music. Definitely gets you ready to fuck shit up in the gym. 

Or is hardstep a cross with dubstep? I’ve personally never been too into dubstep.. the robotic/grating drops just aren’t my favorite."
20361,Do you or u/theCrownedRoyal have any good spotify hardstyle playlists? I'm trying to get into hardstyle and I'm having trouble figuring out what tracks to look for
20362,"hold on whats mine, found it on here somewhere, ""Hardstep"" by Robert Kern on spotify. Also sorry if thats personal info just trying to make it searchable. I bounce aroun on that 165 song playlist on shuffle and find something I can get huge to often."
20363,I tend to prefer old school trance as I love that 'rolling' feeling. Only problem is it can be a little hypnotic and I get really thrown off if someone tries to talk to me.
20364,I guess that’s why I bust in my pants every time I don’t listen to EDM at the gym
20365,I cum every time I get a pump
20366,I’m usually into hip hop but I’m not opposed to it! Anyone specific? Excision would probably be good.
20367,"Excision's yearly mixes are the shit bro. Also any mix from the never say die label. Mixes are just the way to go in the gym for me, the constant drops keep the intensity up like a normal song can't."
20368,"EDM hype train 💪💪💪

20371,Podcasts. I can't listen to music while I train because I end up constantly skipping tracks trying to find one I wanna jam to.
20372,I was finding cardio mind numbingly boring and kept skipping it until I started listening to podcasts.  Now I actually look forward to them when I know I have good episodes in my playlist
20373,I listen to podcasts during cardio only. Need something more upbeat for weights
