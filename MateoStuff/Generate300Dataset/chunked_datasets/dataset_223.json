73687,"Thank you so much for a great advice. Btw, why did you switch from paperlike to iCarez? Any idea how long paperlike lasts :)"
73688,No I have never bought paperlike. Wayyyy too expensive for what the function is. I bought the 2 pack iCarez for half the price and I still have the original one I put on 4 months ago. Still looks brand new and I usually wipe it down lightly once a week for hand oils.
73689,"Hello, does the ICarez wear down the pencil head a lot? Because I was going to get the paperlike due but then a lot of ppl said that it wear down the pencil head quite a lot"
73690,I wanted to get that one but they don't sell it in the UK
73691,"Bellemond.   

https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07RPLXDXN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_HLhrFbFKEJHGF

I’ve compared it to the elecom, and I prefer it for the price and feel using the pencil. 

There was also another post a while back on a video comparing it to the paper like (don’t have it on hand...) which found that it was a lot better than the paper like too"
73692,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZOU6KsZRI&t=590s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZOU6KsZRI&t=590s) 

Here's a link to the video that made me choose Bellemond over Paperlike. Not sure if it is the same one you saw."
73693,Thank you guys a lot!
73694,What’s the best alternative to the Bellemond? It isn’t available in the US
73695,I love ESR like paper less and best for longlife tips
73697,How's it holding up?
73698,I really like the ones from Xiron on Amazon.  I've tried to get used to writing without a matte screen protector but can't get used to the feel.  I've used this on one as well as my families and they are all happy with the writing feel with them.
73700,ICarez is surprisingly good...I’m enjoying using my iPad Pro 2020 more than before...also for the price you get 2 screens...thats a decent offer.
73701,"I’m waiting for my Paperlike screen protector, can’t wait to try it for both writing school notes and digital drawing. I was recommended to buy Paperlike by a lot of ig and yt people who’s using it on a daily basis. I’ll let you know how it is when I get it!"
73702,Thank you for your answer. Looking forward to it \^\^
73703,"well Instagram influencers and youtubers get product sponsorship on their channels, so I wouldn't necessarily trust their opinion.  I have used PL version 2 since feb personally, mostly for procreate with a pencil gen 2, I have had a great experience with it over the normal glass ipad experience.  I haven't had to change my nib either, and I have 2 apple pencil's to compare. (people complain that paperlike wears down nibs like sandpaper...)"
73704,"I tried several matte screen protectors and decided that Elecom had the least grain. Even though it does have some grain, it was way, way less than PaperLike and some other matte screen protectors. Also the writing is stellar on it."
73705,Elecom is a bit too expensive for me. Have you tried Supershieldz or Techarmor? How’s the grain in those?
73706,No use in covering your $300 - $1300 iPad with a cheap screen protector. Elecom isn't even that expensive
73708,"so I don't know what ""Bond"" is, and I know the screen protector wasn't smooth, so it was probably ""bond."""
73709,I'm personally using the [Supershieldz](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Generation-Anti-Glare-Anti-Fingerprint-Replacement/dp/B07K1JR66F/ref=mp_s_a_1_12?keywords=supershieldz+ipad+pro+12.9&qid=1564635686&s=gateway&sprefix=super+shield+iPad+pro+12&sr=8-12) and it's the best bang for your buck. The Elecom has even less grain but cost 3 times more.
73710,"I think I might try Supershieldz. 

Have you used TechArmor’s before? If so, how does the grain compare?"
73711,I haven't. I used icarez matte screen before and supershieldz is definitely better.
73712,Okay thanks!
73713,"quick question: for supershieldz, does it come with installation kit or just a microfiber cloth ?"
73714,"Unfortunately, it doesn't have any installation kit, only the cloth. I suggest installing it in a hot shower. It really worked for me."
73715,Good luck. I don’t think you will find one. But I hope someone replies.
73716,Tradeoffs tradeoffs; amazing display or better writing. Why can’t we have it all? :(
73717,Zagg! They are the BEST! I use their glass elite for writing notes but here's the one they specifically made for writing on [https://www.zagg.com/en\_us/glassfusion-plus-canvas-ipad-12-9-pro](https://www.zagg.com/en_us/glassfusion-plus-canvas-ipad-12-9-pro)
73718,"I second this! I’ve been using one of these for about a month and it’s great. The first screen protector that doesn’t wear my pencil tip down after just a few hours of drawing. I’ve tried paperlike, multiple versions of Elecom and some other random brands."
73719,"There’s one made by a company called Mothca on Amazon. I really love these. They are glass, and are a great texture."
73720,Is it a matte (paper-feel) protector?
73721,Yes. I have one. It is great to write on. Solid customer service as well.
73722,"I like the Moshi iVisor AG, but it is pretty expensive."
73723,"I got mine from Whitestone on Amazon. $15, comes with 2 protectors, and so far it has been really good.  I love the way writing feels now, but more importantly, the tapping noise when using the pencil has been reduced a lot."
73724,"I got this Japanese one and love it. $23 for one. Feels just like paper, hides fingerprints pn the screen very well, and has minimal graininess and distortion. 

I hated the feeling of drawing on glass and this feels just like drawing on paper with a chunky pencil. Better than PaperLike in every possible way.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XH81MWY/"
73725,Not all matte screen protectors are the same. Clearview or Elecom from Japan at Amazon.com is the best among all. Very minimum distortion and lots of tooth when writing on it. I don’t think there is any better than that in the market place. I personally had tried so many of them.
73726,Nice. I don’t think I’ll buy one of that myself any time soon but the point of my post was to tell people that not all screen protectors are the same. I might consider it if I have more spare money.
73727,Thanks for posting. I’m going to give it a shot.
73728,"I’m the complete opposite, I thought I disliked writing on glass until I used a matte protector. The worse quality display wasn’t so bad but writing on it felt terrible. It sounded weird and felt unnatural. Went back to glass and I appreciate it so much more. Definitely not my cup of tea."
73729,Weird. Do you not draw on paper much?
73731,"Well that was the point of this post that I made anyway. I think it’s not really fair to generalise the experience of all matte screen protectors having tried only one, but I definitely agree that it’s a very personal thing. I’ve seen a lot of people saying that they love writing on glass because it feels like writing with a fountain pen."
73732,"Used both the paperlike ($33 USD for two), and the supershieldz ($7 for three). I didn't personally install the paperlike, as the ipad I used already had it on. While I put the supershieldz on my own 11"".     
Even if the paperlike was cheaper, I still preferred the shieldz. Felt better, looked better. I can't go back to glass, just like writing and drawing on matte. Also fingerprints, they're not a pain in the ass."
73733,"We’ll I personally love the Paperlike. Writing on it feels so good to me. There’s this ‘softness’ that I can’t describe, and it just makes my writing feel right.

How did you already have the Paperlike on though?"
73734,"I love my PaperLike, and their customer service is top quality.  I fucked up installing both of the ones they sent me, emailed them and they sent two more out for free.  They also sent me an email with different ways of installing them to make it easier/dust free."
73735,I recently got a set of matte screen protectors by iCarez for my 11 inch iPad Pro. I think it had some of the best reviews I saw on Amazon. The application process was pretty intuitive. There was a video you could follow online if you needed it. The quality seems good. It keeps the fingerprints away and writing on it feels good. There is some degradation in the screen quality but it does not seem too bad. I plan to keep it for now.
73737,I haven’t had any problems. Maybe a thick glass screen protector but the thin films shouldn’t effect the touch
73738,I have not had that issue with any of the matte screen protectors that I’ve tried.
73739,"Pressing A now, sir"
73740,Goddammit I just bought a KW mobile one a few days ago :( arrives in a few weeks
73741,"Well how’s your experience with it? Like someone else said in this thread, they prefer writing on glass, so I wouldn’t be surprised if someone actually prefers writing on the kwmobile one. I just personally didn’t.

Edit: I somehow missed the part where you said that it arrives in a few weeks. Sorry."
73742,All good will let you know when I get it :)
73743,"Cool of you to try some comparisons.

I had a chance to try out Paperlike since that's what my pal uses, but opted to get iCarez and just upgrade if the quality was worse for mine. iCarez is very smooth, easy to install, and the quality was very similar. I think the fineness the the matte finish makes the screen quality drop equally to the Paperlike but the trade off is worth it to me and you get used to it."
73744,"After rereading what I wrote, I kinda feel like I didn’t give the paperlike a high enough praise. I actually *really* like the feel of it, so much so that I don’t really care what it does to the way my screen looks.

Since you’ve tried both iCarez and the Paperlike, do you think that there is a difference in the way the pencil feels on them? I wanted to get iCarez at first because that’s what most people have been using, but I couldn’t easily get it here in the UK."
73745,"Very similar and same satisfying sounds, wouldn't be able to note a difference personally. 

Paperlike is a quality product, I don't think anyone who goes for them should feel they spent too much. I mean we are protecting an expensive item and Paperlike definitely gets the job done."
73746,"To be honest, I think that the way it sounds is the least important criteria when it comes to writing. I initially wanted to record how they all sound, but I realised that all three that I’ve tried produce the same scratchy sound. The major difference is in the feedback that you get as you write on it. The Paperlike has a very subtle grip that you won’t notice if you scribbled over it, but if you start writing finer sentences on it, you’ll notice that you have a lot more control over the pencil.

It’s also a bit ‘softer’ than the other two that I’ve tried in a way that I don’t know how to explain. You know the difference between writing on a single sheet of paper over a hard surface versus writing on a stack of paper? The paperlike made it feel a lot more like the latter (perhaps not a stack, but three sheets instead of one). 

Also, I’m kinda more in the ‘no-screen protectors’ gang usually and I got a matte screen protector solely to improve the writing, so this aspect is really important to me."
73747,"I wasn't trying to say the sound is important, just that I enjoy it really. I've doodled a lot on my friends before buying my own, I can't feel a difference same grip to the pencil same softness level. On past matte i've dealt with some do tend to have larger grain (not sure if that the right term for it) which leads to better picture quality but definitely makes it less soft. I've only experienced these two so I can speak on the quality of any other US based ones though. 

If my main use wasn't drawing I would have put a tempered on it personally but since I draw for hours every day I can agree with you there."
73748,"Is there a white haze/glaze from the anti-glare that appears when the screen is reflecting light from certain angles?

That I think affects the visual quality more than the graininess because you would have to view the tablet straight on to minimise that white haze"
73749,"Yeah. As I mentioned in the other comments, it’s mostly the anti-glare that affects the screen quality for the Paperlike. If I was in a dark room, it looks a lot better. 

It doesn’t really matter which angle I’m viewing it from, but it does matter where the light source is. It’s not as bad as I make it seem, but it’s definitely noticeable."
73750,I have a Paperlike order coming this week. I’m looking forward to it. I worry a bit about screen quality. I’ll try it and see how it goes.
73751,Good luck! (:
73752,"Hey man, just wanted to say thanks for your review, I bought the J&D protector and it looks great!"
73754,Thanks for the post and review. Finally got an iPad Pro and was contemplating on purchasing the PaperLike. I then remembered my past matte screen protectors on my phone and wondered if the same graininess would manifest itself on the PaperLike product. I’m glad I did a search and found this to confirm my concerns. 👍🏼
73755,Haha no problem. Congratulations on your iPad. Hope you’ll enjoy it!
73756,Great review! How difficult was it to remove each of  the screen protectors? And where they still usable after?
73757,"They’re not difficult to remove at all. You just use your fingernails and pick them up from the end.

You won’t be able to use them again though. Once you get a bit of dust sticking to it, you’ll never get them off. Maybe if you’re in a completely dust-free environment you might be able to keep them for later, but I highly doubt it."
73758,You should show pics of the screen with the protectors on to show how badly the quality is
73759,"That was my intention but it is difficult to show on camera. 

After coming back to the Paperlike for a day, I think that the issue with the paperlike is the way it absorbs and disperses light. If I’m sitting in a dark room like I’m doing right now, it doesn’t look that bad. In hindsight, I probably should have taken comparison shots of how it looks like with light behind me. It’s especially noticeable on darker backgrounds.

This is my last Paperlike so I don’t really want to remove it to make a comparison with the other one that I have, but here’s a picture when the lights are on and the brightness up on full:

édit: a bunch of typos"
73760,"OMFG I’M IN THE PIC, I’M FAMOUS !!"
73761,Yeay congrats! <3
73763,"Hm. I know if that was me because I don’t remember writing about it, but I do slide on the dock all the time. I’m glad it works for you anyway!"
73764,"This makes total sense.

Your writing quality negatively correlates with your screen quality.

Because anything that’s more matte is going to be worse for screen quality. It’s just physics."
73765,"If youre taking notes im pretty sure you wouldn’t be focused on the screen’s quality that much (or in my case I’m not really paying attention to it at all), you can start off with a matte and see how you like it and if you hate it then just take it off and go with glass. 

Notes on glass sucks but you end up getting used to it after a while; I’ve gone from matte to glass to matte just cause I hated writing on the glass. I could care less about how the screen looks cause my eyes do adjust and it’s barely noticeable.. 

My advice since you said mainly for notes: matte :)"
73766,"I have a friend have ipad with matte screen protector and is loving it. But the image quality looked terrible for watching videos etc. it was a dealbreaker for me as it has such an amazing speaker quality but by applying the matte it turned out not what someone would expect. 

So I got myself a normal screen protector and I’m pretty much in love with that. Sure it took 1-2 days to adjust but it was worth it plus it didn’t made much impact on my handwriting considering I usually write around 10-11 hrs a day."
73767,I would probably try out both and see if i can deal with writing on glass :)
73768,Do you have any recommendation for a good matte protector?
73769,"I’ve been happy with iCarez brand. No handholding guides or frames to use for installation, but if you can read the directions and use common sense, you can probably successfully install."
73770,"I’m currently using the Supershieldz one, but icarez and bellemond are also good. anything but paperlike, its overpriced for no reason and starts looking bad really fast"
73771,Bellemond
73772,"Hi. I'm a teacher and write on mine all day. I've had matte screen protectors on mine for years. If your primary goal is taking notes, then you will appreciate matte. I do watch a lot of media on my 12.9 also and it it is brighter without the matte protection on but not to the point that it's unusable. I wouldn't sacrifice the inferior writing experience of not using a matte protector to gain some improvements for Netflix etc. With the matte protector on, it's still an enjoyable experience watching media. Just my two cents"
73773,Thanks a lot for your insights!
73774,What screen protector do you use?
73775,I am happy without one. Well the iPad stays always at home and covered with the smart folio.
73776,I was like that too once… but someday you’ll be using your iPad in the sun and notice a shiny line that won’t erase.
73777,"Or you will be in the sun with a screen protector, the glare will be so bad it will blind you and you wont be able to use your iPad ever again 😂"
73778,"I am really really really considering just like, fuck it, you know, don't put a protector and just use the bare screen. But my brain is telling me: what if you scratch the screen:(. I take care of my stuff but sometimes they get scratch by random things laying around since I work in a lab."
73779,I got the cheapest icarez screen protector and I forget it’s on most of the time.
73780,If you don’t need the matte protector you can go with a tempered glass one (I really like them and they preserve screen clarity!)
73781,"I’ve used the iPad since Day Zero, all have served as EDC replacements for my laptop.   Despite regular Pencil use, I have never scratched, chipped or cracked any of the screens."
73782,"I’ve been using PaperLike on mine. It is nice if you draw or do a lot of work with the Apple Pencil. But if you are only taking notes, I don’t think you need one. The newer PaperLike ones don’t impact the color as much, but it is noticeable at times. Also keep in mind that they will wear out the nib faster. But if you really want that texture while writing, try it out."
73783,"Whatever you prefer. 

If you have an Apple Pencil and use it a lot, you may want a screen protector, otherwise, the screen itself is very durable from scratches, and you don't really need one. 

For me, I can't stand glare, so I have a matte screen protector to reduce glare. Great screen quality doesn't mean shit if there's a giant glare on your screen. 

Moreover, my two primary uses for my iPad are digital art and reading comics. 

It feels almost like I'm reading an actual paper comic with my matte screen protector. It doesn't reduce the quality of the image, but it does give it a slightly different quality. 

As for art, I use the apple pencil a lot. The Matte screen protector makes the friction feel better and more like drawing on paper. 

In conclusion, it's all preference. 

Do you like the look of matte or glossy displays better? 

If you like matte: get a matte screen protector. 

If you like glossy: Get a glossy, tempered glass screen protector if you use the apple pencil, and leave it bare if you don't."
73784,Thanks for your insights! I think matte is the way to go
73785,"I’ve had both, tested both, for movie watching or browsing the matte screen protector was just an eye sore… Everything has a textured look. 

The writing aspect felt like paper with matte screen protector, but it did not blow the “experience” out of the water for me to be OK with the loss of screen viewing quality."
73786,"It depends on how you are taking notes. I use a matte screen protector because i do a lot of writing for work with the Apple Pencil (meeting notes, planning, diagramming, etc). Glass is ""too fast"" of a feeling to write naturally. I used Paperlike and enjoyed it, currently using Bellemond and am liking it so far. Yes the image quality isn't as amazing as without it, but not a deal breaker, it's still really nice. 

Another option can be perhaps looking at nibs that give you a better feel for writing with the Pencil, however, i haven't seen any highly reviewed ones."
73787,I don't use one.
73788,"If you’ll be taking notes a lot, MATTE! I’ve been using matte screen protector since I got my iPad. At one point, I tried glass protector, but I went back to matte after a week because it was super slippery and I hated the glare."
73789,"Matte for practicality. Glass for looks. Tried the matte. Was nice, didn't like how it made videos look. Switched to gloss. Love how it looks, I prefer how the matte felt. I want to switch back to matte now. There's no right answer, ugh."
73790,"Makes sense, the only thing really holding me background getting a matte protector right now is the miniled :’("
73791,"I love my paper like dupe from Amazon!!
I recently got the actual paper like screen protector and it’s great and all but I kinda liked the dupe from Amazon better!"
73792,I always get glass for my phones and matte for my iPad. Matte on the iPad is perfect for the Apple Pencil and hides the fingerprints way better which is a necessity for a tablet in my mind.
73793,Sounds about right! Having a huge screen with lots of fingerprints can look terrible...
73794,Personally I think glass screen protectors are by far the best option. But a fold-over case makes them unnecessary on the iPad for me at least. Maybe if you wear jewelry or don’t want a case that folds to protect it it might be different for you.
73795,"I initially thought I won't use any screen protector at all, until I saw some hairline scratches on my screen. Not sure how it even got there, never dropped and always in a case.

Ended up getting an ESR tempered glass protector and I must say that the screen clarity is still amazing with it applied.  And works with MK as well."
73796,"I use matte, So I don't get glare and too much reflection."
73797,"Glare, reflection, and fingerprints are all mitigated a bit more by matte. It’s my choice, too!"
73798,glass is so loud with any variation of the pencil. matte is still clicky but not as much. it feels more natural too. my only real problem with the matte is that it gets gunky really quick if i dont keep my hands super clean when im using my fingers like normal
73799,Yea! But even the glass protector needs cleaning every so often!
73800,"If you’re writing on it a lot, I definitely vote matte. My favorite matte screen protector is the Bersem Paperfeel because it has a very rough texture. It feels great to write on in my opinion. However, other people may prefer a less gritty texture in which case try the iCarez (the knockoff equivalent of the Paperlike)"
73801,"I personally prefer matte for using the Apple Pencil to write or draw, but if you're just typing with the magic keyboard or something either should work. Personal preference regardless, maybe try both and see what you think"
73802,Yea i have the magic keyboard but most of the time i take notes with my hand.
73803,"If you enjoy having sex wearing a thick condom and blurry glasses I highly recommend any matte screen protectors. I’ve bought icarez twice and also that brand that every iPad YouTube host is sponsored by. 

As for me and my house we will party naked. I write on my iPad for 2-3 meeting hours a day. Then I type using magic keyboard for 3-4 hours and at night I photo edit or watch movies or play games. If I ONLY wrote on my iPad I’d 100% buy an older gen iPad pro and rock a screen muddier."
73804,"See, I bought the m1 ipad pro thinking it might last me longer than, say, a refurbished ipp 2018 from apple. With the student discount, I really paid around 850 for the ipad so not that big of a difference compared to the 2018 model."
73805,"I bought the PaperLike matte screen protector but I also bought the iPad to use for school (taking notes and etexts), Kindle, and digital drawing. I really like it and it made such a difference with the Apple Pencil. I haven’t really noticed any problems when watching Netflix or YouTube. Also, as a bonus, PaperLike actually sends you two screen protectors when you order one."
73806,I heard a lot of great things and terrible things about paperlike. There is so much controversy over this brand I am just super confused at this point haha
73807,I am too. I have one sitting on my desk and am torn about adhering it for fear it fills the screen noticeably
73808,"I use mine for drawing and matte just feels better than a glass protector. 

I do watch streamers on twitch a lot and I don’t see a real problem where i’d need to switch protectors to watch a video."
73809,i’ve had a lot of people compliment me on my matte screen
73810,my favorite thing about you is actually the matte screen protector on your ipad. just kidding. it will be hilarious if one day someone said that to me lol
73811,"I use a cheap matte screen protector on mine because I don't like the glare and smudges you get with glossy glass. I do think the overall image quality is slightly worsened by it, but I felt the same way with the Paperlike when I had one of those too. I think it just comes with the territory with screen protectors.

Here's the one I'm using rn. It's way cheaper than a paperlike, but close to it in quality imo: https://www.amazon.com/iCarez-Anti-Glare-Protector-12-9-inch-Compatible/dp/B07GZKL8WH/ref=sr\_1\_3?crid=1LCWKQ62YME30&dchild=1&keywords=icarez+ipad+pro+12.9+matte+screen+protector&qid=1628538852&sprefix=icare%2Caps%2C236&sr=8-3"
73812,Thanks for the suggestion!
73813,"IMO no screen protector. Matte distorts image and I don't like the feeling. TG protectors are pointless unless you care about small scratches, which I don't. Screen protectors do not prevent cracks"
73814,Can someone just invent a 2 in 1 matte-glass screen protector 😩😩😩 combining both’s strengths ahhh
73815,"You speak my mind, sir. But there is something called physics unfortunately. Surely one day we may get something close to that."
73816,They have these matte glass screen protecters where I live in Thailand.
73817,I’m surprised matte glass screen protectors aren’t brought up regularly.  gives you a slight texture for the Apple Pencil plus whatever protection the glass can offer.
73818,i know this is an old post but - are you using a matte glass screen protector? if so can you post the link to the one you got?
73819,You should try getting a magnetic screen protector. Put it on when you’re doing notes and take it off when you want to enjoy the mini led screen. So it’s a win win situation
73820,">r. Put it on when you’re doing notes and take it off when you want to enjoy the mini led screen. So it’s a win win situation

which one do you use?"
73821,I only use tempered glass. The matte protectors always leaves the screen frosted. What’s the point of losing all that detail.
73822,Especially with the new display on the 12.9 model. Why spend an extra $300 to get the better display when you're going to ruin the viewing experience with a frosted screen protector?
73823,Thanks for that.  I always used tempered glass with mine but had recently considered getting the paper like kind.  I think I’ll opt out I don’t mind drawing with the glass.
73824,The matte ones are great for glare and no fingerprints. Wouldn’t protect much in a drop but would fend off minor scratches.
73825,Some people also use it for the difference in texture when it comes to drawing. I'm torn between getting one or not for my new iPad Pro :(
73826,I’ve been using [this](https://www.amazon.com/Mothca-Protector-Anti-Glare-Anti-Fingerprint-Dazzling/dp/B07WLCNV9B) since October and can’t recommend enough. Matte and tempered glass
73827,Does it hurt the quality of watching videos ?
73828,I definitely see that point!  However the point of having some sort of paper like feel would be nice for writing notes.
73829,"For writing notes it feels pretty much the same IMO. I tried Paperlike and did not like it, took it off after a few months and will not be using the 2nd one in the pack. Scratches easily, reduces screen quality. When I took it off I did a half glass half Paperlike writing comparison and it felt the same. You’ll get used to it, just give it some time and practice."
73830,"Agreed, I definitely got used to writing with my current iPad, (which is just a normal ipad with a first generation pencil).  I might try and buy a cheap paper-like protector just to test out and get a feel for.  However I do wonder how my handwriting would improve on the protector since it's definitely sloppier on the glass."
73831,Get pencil tips for your Apple Pencil
73832,"Yes, that’s what I recommend. Using one of those silicone Apple Pencil tips."
73833,What kind do you recommend?
73834,No more fingerprints or glare. Although I did mean to order tempered glass and wasn’t paying attention and talking and ended up with these.
73835,I know the distorted screen might be annoying but fingerprints all over the screen would annoy me even more. It’s especially weird trying use your pencil over fingerprints. Matte doesn’t have that issue. There are matte “tempered glass” ones that I’m looking to get. The paper like one ruins the pencil tip too quickly and the screen protectors gets scuffed bug the pencil tip too based on the reviews I’ve seen.
73836,I didn't even think about the fingerprints and the writing experience on that.  And I don't think I would be buying the actual paperlike brand rather a knock off of it.
73837,"I honestly wouldn’t get anything. I’ve been an iPad only user since around 2016-ish and have never used any type of screen protector of any kind. The screen is meant to be used without one, along with using the pencil that way. The finger prints do suck but a super microfiber cloth is easy to carry around in your bag. Just my opinion. Good luck."
73838,"Nothing, just Apple care"
73839,"I was wondering about this. If you have apple care, can you just pay the $50 or whatever to get a new screen if it gets scratched up?"
73841,What do you mean by frosting the screen?
73842,"I say just get a silicon pencil cover.

I have a matte screen protector but based on my testing, the silicon pencil nib cover can be an alternative to a matte screen protector if writing feel is what you're after."
73843,Moshi screen protectors - on all my iPads - incredible but they are expensive
73844,"I’ve got a removable matte screen protector from Amazon I’ve been enjoying. It’s a thicker material that’s reusable, so you can easily take it on and off with no issues. Minimal image distortion as well!"
73853,Link pls
73846,"Here’s the one I got, looking at it now it’s got some mixed reviews: www.amazon.ca/dp/B08MCGCWXV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_FT34CWFS2DF4M27878NR?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
73847,Just don't go for paperlike. I liked it at the beginning but after like a month/ month and half of using it with pencil the iPad became unusable as the foil became super scratched by the pencil. I had to replace the foil and looking forward to buy this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07QMV3Z87/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8
73849,Do you feel like the benefits for note taking kinda outweigh the issue of having a tiny bit of distortion?
73850,"I’m going with tempered glass, but I’m a dropper so I value protection over writing comfort."
73851,What’s the best tempered glass one out there?
73852,"Yup! I always use the super shields one but ima try the bersom one this time. My fingers are a grease magnet. 

Side note: the supershields matte screen protector barely distorts my screen"
73854,"IMO depends.  
I have a matte screen protector on my 2018 11"" Pro and love it. That's because my priorities are notetaking and drawing/art. I do a little video/picture editing as well, and haven't noticed any color distortion, but then again I'm not a professional so even if there is, it's not a big deal to me. So like I said, it depends on what you intend to do with your ipad."
73855,"I just get Apple care. I am way more concerned with how thin and easy it is to bend. If anything,a case for back to keep that from ever happening. Mine definitely has bend at this point. Not enough to matter,but it’s bent a little. I usually have nothing on it,because keyboard folio is annoying if your not using it"
73856,"I've been drawing on my 9.7 iPad for two years and the screen isn't scratched at all. Thinking of buying the new iPad 12.9 too. I've asked this about a week too and lots of people suggest that you should be fine without the screen protector. But again, we haven't seen the new iPad display so I don't know if it will scratch or not"
73857,"I was very hesitant as well then i tried one and couldn't believe the difference it made. It dramatically improves the drawing experience. Now i cant stop drawing on my ipad. Plus, it makes fingerprints less apparent and easier to clean."
73858,"Any recommendations on good ones that don’t distort images and colors by much. I like everything about them, I’m just worried about the color quality"
73859,Elecom smooth is what i landed on and its great. I hardly notice the distortion and the texture is perfect in my opinion. Its a bitch to install but i found an easy work around if you are interested ill share it.
73860,Hey! I have an elecom smooth coming in the mail today. Mind sharing your install tip?
73861,"You need tape, an exacto blade or box cutter and a metal straight edge. Basically i recreated the hinge technique that a lot of other companies use. Make sure to clean the ipad well befor you begin. First you cut the film the screen protector sits on flush with edge of the screen protector on the side with the camera cut out. You only need to cut this side as it will be the side we use to align it. Next place four pieces of tape on the back of the ipad along the top edge where the camera  is. Make sure enough tape is left off the ipad so it can wrap around to the other side. You only need maybe a half an inch. Flip the ipad over, and align the screen protector. Hold it in place as you wrap the tape around top edge securing the protector in place creating a hinge. Now slowly remove the film from the back of the protector. Leting it fall naturally. Work out as many air bubbles as you can and remove dust if you need to. Dont worry about any air bubbles you can get to. They will go away over time. I didnt believe that but its true.

Ps. Sorry for the late response."
73862,"No matte screen protectors for me! I do only tempered glass screen protectors with oleophobic coating. I have switched to silicone tip covers to add a little texture, drag and quiet the tapping noise of the pencil on glass though. ;)

Why use a matte screen protector that dulls the gorgeous screen when you can just put a silicon tip on your Apple Pencil and accomplish the same thing without compromising screen clarity??"
73863,What brand of tip did you use?
73864,And which protector?
73865,"I spent way too much money trying different screen protectors when I bought my iPad Pro. Everything either decreased the sensitivity of the screen or decreased the crispness, or both."
73866,"Just be aware that they can eat up your apple pencil tips, so make sure to have a replacements (I removed my matte screen protector. That was one of the reasons among others.). IMO, it's best without protection :)"
73867,I use a matte but just put screen brightness on full. Works great and picture quality is still really high (2020 12.9 pro)
73868,"I highly recommend the Elecom Rough Matte screen protector. I used the Paperlike, iCarez and the TechArmor and the Elecom is absolutely fantastic. I draw and write on my ipad and it feels the closest to pencil to paper. I cant give it enough praise."
73869,+1 for ELECOM after trying Paperlike (1) and Moko.
73870,"A matte screen protector will wear down your apple pencil tip, how quickly will depend on how much you use it. The most common matte screen protector is the Paperlike brand screen protector. I've never used it myself but I've heard the new version of it is easily scratched and wears down the apple pencil tip quickly. Again, I've never tried it but if you consider it be sure to check out the reviews. A matte screen protector decreases glare, prevents fingerprints, and makes writing and drawing easier. I have this one from Amazon: [Xiron Paperlike Screen Protecor](https://www.amazon.com/Paperlike-Protector-XIRON-Sensitivity-Protector，Compatible/dp/B07NJZB555) They make a 11"" and 12.9"" version. I have not tried this one yet because I haven't gotten my iPad yet but I want a matte screen protector because I will be using my iPad for notes and drawing as well. I didn't want to drop a ton of money on the Paperlike brand matte screen protector since I was uncomfortable with the recent reviews on it. 

A glass screen protector shouldn't wear down your apple pencil tip since it's smooth like the iPad screen. If it does, it wouldn't be as quick as a matte screen protector. Of course glass has more glare and fingerprints. I don't have any to recommend because I haven't looked into those. Some people like the feeling of drawing/writing on a smooth screen. So you may want to try drawing on the iPad first before buying either one to see of you like the smooth feeling or not. 

Hopefully this helps!"
73871,"A matte one, it just feels so much better. 

I've used the matte screen protector from tech armor for years and it didn't require me to switch nibs in my pen. For the past few months, I've used paperlike, and I've had to switch nibs 3 times already. I don't find the difference noticeable, so I'll be sticking with the cheap option."

73873,"I can give you my experience from three I've tried:

- [**Moko:**](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KXD4LHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Very abrasive. So much that it actually abraded my fingertips and wore out a pencil tip in a matter of weeks. Very grainy picture. Best to avoid.
- **Paperlike (1st generation):** Very fine. Like drawing on a piece of fine cartridge paper laying over glass. Good for people who want to retain image quality and just want a little paper-likeness.
- [**Elecom:**](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KZ35N37/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) The sweet spot. Much closer to drawing on sketchbook paper, but similarly over glass. Minimal nib-wear and not too much compromise on screen quality.

The newer generation paperlikes would probably be a good idea if you just want a little bit of a paper feel. Otherwise I highly recommend Elecom."
73874,I love my elecom screen protector. I love the rough texture over the smoother one. It feels just like my sketchbook. I also like that they make removable screen protectors if you still want to avoid a grainy screen at all cost.
73875,Did the rough one lose roughness over time? I read that it gets a little less rough but in a good way for some people.
73876,"Yes over time it does smooth out in the most used areas. I personally prefer the texture when they’re new but even after months of being written on everyday, I still loved the screen protector."
73877,"Thanks! How did the quality of the Paperlike hold up over time? Did the picture sharpness/clarify worsen at all due to wear and scratches over time? Also, how was the picture quality with Elecom compared to Paperlike?

Edit: fixed wording of last question"
73878,"> How did the quality of the Paperlike hold up over time?

I don't think I used it for long enough TBH. Maybe only a few months before swapping to the Elecom.

>Also, how was the picture quality with Elecom? Was it the same as Paperlike?

As I said ""not too much compromise on screen quality"". A little bit less sharp than a naked screen, perhaps a little bit of chromatic aberration. 

After two years of daily use (drawing) my Elecom screen doesn't show any scratches, but it's losing its paper-feel around the center. I might replace it at some point but it doesn't seem like a big issue."
73879,"Thanks, I’ll probably try the Elecom first to see if the picture quality is good enough for me, and if not then I’ll try Paperlike"
73880,"I have the paperlike and like it so much I never bothered trying others. I can’t notice image deterioration, in fact it does such a good job of hiding glare and smudges that I think it looks better with it that without it. 

I have the 12.9 and mostly use the pencil for note taking or marking up documents and it’s fantastic for that. My kid is a decent creative and loves drawing on it with procreate so much that she got a similar protector for her iPad Air."
73881,"Just gonna chime in here since nobody else mentioned it, but I've been using the [MagGlass](https://www.amazon.com/MagGlass-Tempered-Glass-Screen-Protector/dp/B07QB4JJV6/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=magglass+ipad+11&qid=1619187726&sr=8-4) screen protector for the last 6 months or so and I find it to be the best matte option for my use case. It's a bit hard to explain but color contrast is almost boosted because of the lack of reflections, and the 'grain' of the matte coating is fairly minimal compared to what I've seen with other screen protectors unless you have your face right up against the display. 

&#x200B;

I suppose the primary standout feature is that it's made of tempered glass, which I obviously prefer because of the added layer of protection. However, since it's made of glass the drawing experience is still pretty mediocre; if the bare screen has a 1/10 resistance rating I'd rate the protector maybe 3/10. Which is to say it helps, but not that much. So far I also have little to no wear on my pen tip. Edges are a little sharp but it doesn't bother me much since it's pretty much a full-coverage screen protector.

&#x200B;

Figure I'd also mention that even though it picks up fingerprints easier than a regular glossy screen protector, I've had a much better experience with this one when compared to other plastic/ PET films, which tended to get gross pretty quickly. 6 months in and I don't even have a scratch on this thing, nor do I have any quality degradation; unless I break it, I can see it staying on for the rest of my iPad's life.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps!"
73882,This is what I've been using. I read weekly and haven't had a single bad thing to say about them. Super cheap too. [Supershieldz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1LLCBZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
73883,Thanks! Did you notice any picture clarity difference after putting it on? And how much friction would you say it produces compared to paper?
73884,"There is a slight difference in clarity, but I haven't minded it all. Every matte screen protector has this issue. I've had screen protectors that were much worse that added a lot of the digital noise. I don't mind this one at all. Words still look very crisp. I won't be taking it off any time soon. As far as friction goes, it's somewhat similar to a paper texture. I enjoy writing on it more than the glass surface for sure. After using this one for a while I wouldn't spend the money on any of the expensive screen protectors out there. This one gets the job done perfectly for me."
73885,Everyone's already mentioned the brands. I just want to add that you get a rainbow effect on the screen that is kind of grainy. So if you're reading with a white background it might be too distracting. Worth trying though as they aren't expensive and might solve your problem.
73886,How is Paperlike without using a pencil and just as a touch screen?  I see they are on pre-order as well which makes me care even less ha.
73887,It feels fine touch screen! Just as responsive as without it. Paperlike 2 doesn’t really impact image quality either
73888,Well I think image quality is the same and yet it’s still changed. There’s a weird grittiness to the image but only noticeable when looking at solid colours especially white
73889,I just ordered the elecom smooth.... should be here later this week. I’ll report back
73890,How is it? Thinking of this one too
73891,"How was it? I have only seen reviews for the rough one. Does it feel like paper? Is the grainyness too bad?

How long did it last?"
73892,"Everyone seems to be recommending PaperLike, but I don’t think anyone has mentioned the huge drawback of it and that is that you loose the sharpness, brightness and colors from the original iPad screen! Which is a huge bummer if you want to watch movie or videos aswell on your iPad! I actually think nearly all Matte protectors will do this, and the only way to avoid it is to use clear protectors or glass protectors."
73893,What do you recommend instead of matte but good for the pencil?
73894,"Unfortunately I haven’t come across any non matte protector that still gives paper like feel. Maybe it’s not possible. Clear and glass protectors are none matte and don’t give paper feel, more like a glass feel as the standard iPad screen and because of this they don’t reduce the screen quality like matte does."
73895,I think the ESR matte protectors with slight paper like feel are the best for me. I have tried them all including paper like v1 and 2's but currently switching between glass and ESR every couple of months. Paper like is like 35 bucks for 2 and the texture wears down over time so its up to you if you think its worth it.
73896,Paperlike screen protectors scratch easily if you use the pencil alot. The matte material also wears off quickly. Get the elecom screen protector instead
73897,They really do scratch sooooooo easily
73898,I use a PaperLike and absolutely love it.
73899,Paper like is what I put on my 12.9! Just got it. Feels amazing
73900,Has anyone tried magglass tempered glass matte screen protector. Wonder if this would be best of both.
73901,Another one for PaperLike. I’m not in love with it being matte but it’s amazing with the pencil. And you don’t mind it in the long run without the pencil.
73902,Is PaperLike a brand? Where do you get it? I just searched amazon and didn’t see what looked like a brand with that name.
