21493,"As far as sad comics go, that's among the very best I've read, and with a bit of guilt as someone who has enjoyed Milne's original works and even the Disney bastardizations. That was a punch in the gut."
21494,This is impossible to read on Alien Blue :( Time to whip out the ol' laptop...

21500,Sorry about that. I linked directly to the artist's page to credit him. Thanks for finding this.
21501,"yeah... it's the sites fault. If you click right and ""show image"" it's there in a decend quality."
21502,"It's a good comic, and true too, there was some bitterness between Christopher Robin and AA Milne.  When Christopher was in school, he was teased mercilessly by the other kids, they kept asking him if he was saying his prayers.  

There is a bio of CR Milne around somewhere, I read it several years ago.  

Edit - I really dislike the Disney Pooh, I have ever since someone gave one of those books to my son as a gift, it was a story where Rabbit doesn't like Tigger and he talks the others into abandoning him in the woods.  That would have never have happened in the AA Milne books.  Just thought it was a shitty version of Pooh."
21503,Check out the charming Soviet version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qam9JBk5Oig
21504,Utterly heartwrenching.
21505,"I don't have much meta knowledge on Winnie the Pooh, although this still made me cry. I assume this is his son, who I know he got the idea from. In the slide where he was arguing with someone, was that A.A Milne? Was the son this mad about Winnie the Pooh in real life?"
21506,Fuck.
21507,"I hate to be ignorant but I really couldn't understand this. Plus some parts were hard to read, could someone explain?"
21508,"It's the son of the author of Winnie the Pooh, aka Christopher Robin, remembering his time in the Hundred Acre Wood as a boy and how horrible his father treated him, eventually dying and reuniting with Pooh."
21509,"Awesome, thank you for explaining it to me."
21510,[Kinda ruined the mood for me](http://i.imgur.com/yWSrAhW.png)
21511,I found this oddly hopeful... a kind of happiness in the afterlife sort of deal
21512,"I agree. I think that if there is some sort of afterlife, spending it with Pooh and Piglet would be one of the best possible scenarios."
21513,"I love Winnie The Pooh, I always had an imaginary world and still do, as well as a hard family life.  
This was beautiful, I can only hope my friends well come back to me when I'm old and alone."
21514,Trying to suppress a sob in my office was the hardest thing I've done in a while.

21542,He didn't wanna go to it anyway.
21543,I literally didn't get invited to one of my birthday parties.  My friends made a cake and sang happy birthday and everything but neglected to invite me to the actual show.  It was a good year.
21544,I once found out my friends were throwing me a surprise birthday party. I got so anxious I didn't go. This was before everyone had mobiles so no-one could reach me during. It's the only party I've ever had thrown and I regret it massively 14 years later.

21560,I feel like I should be a part of this.
21561,Probably.
21562,"Doesn't really look edited. Can anyone confirme the validity of these?
I really want them to be original Disney comic-strips for some reaseon... Pooh is a real shit!"
21563,"I believe these are the real thing. There's some [here](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/58728.html), these are definitely the ones published as 'by Disney' ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh_(comic_strip)). Pooh isn't such an asshole in all of them though.

Edit: [Confirmed that the strips from the OP are part of the original series](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/57262.html). [Some are apparently edited though](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/51636.html)"
21564,"They seem genuine in that they would be humorous and benign through the lens of Winnie The Pooh, but taken out of context and in the cynical humor of the internet he sounds like a real fucker."
21565,"I think pooh is being genuine, but the audience can imagine a second meaning."
21566,Exactly - he only seems like a dick because that's what the title would have us think going into reading them.
21568,"That's a good point, but when I watched the new Winnie the Pooh movie last summer, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Pooh is kind of a dick"". He was being so mean to Piglet! And I had intended to watch that movie to relive all the cute childhood memories, but at the end I just wanted to hug Eeyore and put duct tape over Pooh's mouth."
21569,"Apparently it's legit, I've just been reading through them on this website, and he's a jerk a lot. http://www.creators.com/comics/32/58728_thumb.gif

21579,What an asshole
21580,I read that as *he jerks a lot*
21581,"I read it as two friends, one giving the other one shit."
21582,"They seem legit to me, I'm hoping they're real because of how funny it is to see Pooh as such a dick."
21583,"There's no way they are, and the look is very easy to fake. They would just have to either make the text fit the bubbles or change the bubble size, simple task sorry."
21584,"What is the actual story/punchline of the ""you took my spot"" one? 

Almost all of them have a punchline of pooh saying something -- there's hardly any visual gags there. If the punchline isn't pooh being a dick, what else could the punchlines be? Something really cute and endearing?"
21585,"There are many spots, and he wants to sit the only place someone else (piglet) is sitting"
21586,"They're actually legit, or at least most of them. I have a bunch of these saved on my hard drive from one of those official syndicated comics websites a few years ago."

""Yeah Oscar, you're a *grouch*!""

21589,He has undiagnosed depression
