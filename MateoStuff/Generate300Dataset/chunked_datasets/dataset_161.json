51950,Yeah Midnight x Graphite is the way to go. So slick
51951,"Same phone and case, I’ve found the same."
51952,"How clicky are the buttons on the case for you? I've got the leather case for my 13 Pro but the buttons (especially the power button) are very mushy and hard to press when compared to the leather case for the 11 Pro I had before.

Not sure if normal or a defective case."
51953,The buttons are nice and clicky for me on the iPhone 13 Pro Max leather case.
51954,Mine are  satisfyingly clicky.
51955,"I feel like I may have gotten a dud. Mine like doesn’t fit in the case. It’s like the camera bump is slightly too big. I have to keep pulling the case over the corner like once an hour. I feel like if I drop it, the phone is going to fly out of the case."

51957,"Whenever I put mine down, I stand it up like a domino."
51958,"Is the expectation that we hold our phones to use them and set them down on their faces rather than their backs?

ETA: iPhone 13 pro with clear mag safe case doesn’t work on my car’s wi charger because it won’t sit flat. Arg."
51959,"Considering they have no always on screen, I don’t see too much value in putting it face up anyway. Looks better face down and presumably preserves some battery when the screen doesn’t turn on for notifications."
51960,I leave it up to on my desk to tap it for time or if I got any notifications.
51961,"That makes sense. Now that you mention it, on my desk, I have a wooden phone stand from Ikea, so that I can do the same."
51962,I always put my phone down on its face when it’s got a case on
51963,Urban Armor Gear Civilian case allows it to sit completely flat. Got mine today. 13 Pro Max.
51964,I’m very happy with the PITAKA MagEZ Case 2 on my 13 Pro Max.
51965,I should have mine on Tuesday.  I had the MagEZ on my 12 Pro and loved it.
51966,How’s the protection? Will it survive an accidental drop from waist height?
51967,Not sure but I had the same case for my XS Max and it survived several drops.
51968,Are the magnets stronger?
51969,OtterBox Defender Pro is working well so far. Thick case.
51970,"Just wondering do you have a glass tempered screen protector, and how does it fit?"
51971,I have a spigen glass protector that fits well.
51972,Like the other guy I’m using a spigen glass on mine combod with a defender and it works just fine!!
51973,Does it add too much bulk with iphone 13 pro max ?
51974,"I don't know. I got the regular pro, not the max."
51975,Do you find that that case provides enough lip to protect the screen? How is the camera lens protection?
51976,Ringke Onyx
51977,This seems perfect. Thank you
51978,MagSafe compatible?
51979,Wondering the same
51980,Does it wirelessly charge in a Tesla wireless charging bay?  I need this.  :-)
51981,"I am still waiting for my Tesla, than i will test it for you, you gotta wait like 10-15 years :("
51982,Yeah. My Model S LR is still a couple months away!
51983,The case is $11.99 regular price but you get 20% off when you use the code RKSUBSCR at checkout which brings it down to $9.60!
51984,"Returning the apple silicone case not a fan, currently using Spigen clear until the mous limitless 4.0 arrives!"
51985,Is there any wobble when you press the corners on the Spigen clear? Particularly the top left corner when face up.
51986,there is :/
51987,"Dang. Thanks for the answer. Oh yeah, also btw when you say clear case, are you talking about the Ultra Hybrid or Liquid Crystal case?"
51988,I got the Ultra Hybrid!
51989,Why are you not a fan of the apple silicone case? I just bought one off Amazon:)
51990,"There’s just better value (and protection) for the money imo. i didn’t like the feel of it, nor did I feel like my device was protected, also in/out the pocket is a hassle. The mous case ultimately influenced my decision."
51991,You right. Not much protection for the money. How’s the fit of the mous case?
51992,I don’t have it in hand yet! It’s ordered should hopefully have it in the next few days.
51993,"Got it. Let me know after you get it, please."
51994,Found a spigen clear case and bought a black  silicone MagSafe. So far so good.
51995,Spigen Mag Armor MagSafe case
51996,Unicorn beetle sup case. Clear back with durable squared sides. Good price. I took out the screen protector plastic though. [Unicorn Beetle - ](https://www.supcase.com/collections/smartphone-cases/products/iphone-13-pro-max-6-7-inch-unicorn-beetle-edge-with-screen-protector-clear-case-blue)
51997,"I checked out an Amazon review and they said that even with the raised corners on the back, there is still a little wobble. Is it true with yours too? And if so, how much wobbling is there?"
51998,You can type sufficiently and use it flat but if you push hard on it it will wobble slightly.
52000,Anyone have a suggestion for a bumper case with no clear part? Ideally something that matches with the blue pro color
52001,Following. I want a bumper case as well
52002,I haven’t used this brand personally but Rhinoshield has a customizable bumper that gets pretty great reviews.
52003,How about a wallet case like [this?](https://www.mujjo.com/full-leather-wallet-case-for-iphone-13-pro-tan/) I just ordered one.
52004,I order an apple leather case but I’m returning for this one. I ordered on Thursday
52005,I have this case currently on my Xr. It’s a great case.
52006,Nice! For me it was the only one that I could find with a slot for business cards. I ordered the apple case and wallet but it was way to thick.
52007,I always use Spigen Thin Fit cases
52008,I’ll try that this time. My previous few cases were Spigen Ultra Hybrid S with built in kickstands. I removed the stands and will glue it to the new case.
52009,Spigen sells a case for the 13 with a kickstand. On Amazon.
52010,"I got that one, liking it a lot so far."
52011,Ordered a clear spigen case on amz day of preorder and my mous. Just waiting for it to be delivered.
52012,"I bought a Case-Mate Karat Marble Case for my new iPhone 13 Pro Max and it has little bumps to ensure the phone lies flat on its back - I’m obsessed! This detail wasn’t obvious in the product photos online, so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality when it rocked up and adore how the bottom half blends into clear to show the gorgeous gold iPhone colour. So so happy with my choice, DM me if you want me to send you a photo"

52014,Pelican
52015,"I use the Apple Silicone case. While there’s technically some wobble it’s barely noticeable. Not completely flat, but it definitely sits much more flat than not using a case at all."
52016,I’ve gone back and forth between leather and silicone. I prefer the silicone because it seems to work better with the magnets. And I just like the feel more.
52017,"I bought the ""Spigen Tough Armor Case"" for my Max and its completely flat when lying on the back."
52018,"No wobble at all when pressing the corners? If there’s only a little or none, this might be the case to get for me."
52019,"None, the case  has a flat back with some internal padding protection for the phone, it’s completely flat which is why I bought it."

Kickstand lines up with camera bump lip, sits flat."
52021,I second this it’s a great case and if you don’t like the clear case due to fingerprints and smudges get the marsclimber which is matte.
52022,"So, bought a torras without thinking about MagSafe. Ordered a SuperOne(?) with MagSafe and it’s a nice color, changes from blue to purple in light"
52023,"Mous, dbrand, & Nomad cases are my go-to."
52024,Ordered a [Case Mate Phone case](https://i.imgur.com/FGdh3xy.jpg) and was pleasantly surprised. to see it little studs to help it lie flat. :)
52025,No way are those two ridges make it comfortable to hold the phone
52026,it actually isn’t bad! don’t notice it.
52027,I don’t use a case
52028,waiting for the phone rebel gen 3 cases. Look super clean and aesthetic. Can hold flat on all 4 sifes
52029,"Poetic Revolution Series Case

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F2TFTT1

Cheap case that was available at launch to tide me over until I found a case I really liked, and I’ve used Poetic many times in the past so I’m familiar with them. I can lay my phone flat too!"
52030,Just lay it flat on the screen.
52031,"Try Velvet Caviar! I’ve been buying cases from there for years and have never been disappointed. Or Casetify, where you can also customize your phone case."

52034,I have a Mous Clarity on my 12 Pro Max. I think all of the Mous Cases don’t have a raised camera bump. Really good quality too!
52035,What’s the best kind of case to make it so that it is easily getting the phone in and out your jean pockets?
52036,Apple’s silicone or leather cases
52037,www.rokform.com
52038,"My Spigen Ultra Hybrid has a slight ridge on the opposite side of the camera, so there’s no wobble, but it’s not exactly horizontal on a table."
52039,"Otter box sold on Apples store. I bought the black Otterbox with mag safe and it sits on a flat surface and doesn’t rock. It also covers the edges nicely around the stainless steel frame. I really like it, fells good and it’s a huge case.

Edit: it does have a thick lip around the cameras"
52040,"Look for spigen ultra hybrid mag case.
Im using it right now on my iphone 13 pro max"
52041,You're supposed to lay it down on the display /s
52042,"https://i.imgur.com/a2ZwEWl.jpg
Do you like this one? It’s totally flat on the back, and I like this design very much!"
52043,I just need a case that is MagSafe puck compatible with a spigen car mount…
52044,I bought an otter box case. I’m a little worried though because it says it fits an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I bought the 13 pro max though I’m not sure if they’re the same sizes?
52045,Won’t fit. Camera is significantly larger. 13 pro max case will fit a 12 pro max but not vice versa.
52046,Wow…. Not sure why they would market it to fit both…..
52047,You sure they marketed it to fit both or you misunderstood the packaging?
52048,I purchased it off Amazon from the OtterBox section they have. It clearly said “OtterBox Symmetry Series Case for iPhone 13 Pro Max and IPhone 12 Pro Max”. Will definitely be returning it
52049,That's probably the new iPhone 13 Pro Max specific case that they also market as backwards compatible with the 12. Not the other way around. I'd wager it fits your phone.
52050,Did the case end up fitting the 13 pro max? Currently wondering the same thing for myself.
52051,It fit perfectly!
52052,"Great, thank you! Btw, did you get the Symmetry + Mag Safe case? Or was it just the regular Symmetry case?"
52053,Just the regular case. I don’t really have a need for wireless charging. The battery on this phone is pretty good 👍
52054,I usually use a Magbak (BEST magnet case if you are looking) or an apple leather. I’m having a hard time getting over the camera bump… apple leather case isn’t here yet but my mag case slides if I try and put the whole phone flat… it’s driving me crazy.
52055,"But dubious about the 5G claim, but has anyone tried this case and if it sits flat lying on its back? In the picture it looks like it’s got a counter bump on the bottom. 

https://myefm.com/case-armour/aspen/iphone-13-pro-slate-clear"
52056,That phone gonna be thick af with a flush case
52057,yeah my phone no longer charges on my wireless charger cause of the bump :(
52058,Did you ever find a case? I am now looking for something that allows my phone to sit completely flat as well. Was wondering what you went with. or any good runner ups?
52059,Bare cases. They have the thinnest most amazing cases
52060,Any cases that let you cover the cameras?
52061,"This guy reviews lots of cases. Might help you decide.

52062,Love that guy.
52063,"Spigen Ultra Hybrid. Hands down best case I've used. Had it on my 5c, 5s and 6. I'll probably never use another case. Cheap, comfortable to use and great

52066,"Just going against the majority here:

I just bought this case five days ago based on this recommendation. Arrived from amazon in two days, and now after 3 days the back has already scrunched up. When it came it also did not look new. Just a warning from a personal experience story

EDIT: since I now need a new one, was wondering if someone has a non-spigen case to recommend?"
52067,Did you remove the clear plastic sheets on both sides of the back? That's most likely your problem.
52068,"I did. I think I might be one of the few that got one that isn't new. Mine was shipped without any box or like wrapped or anything (the case was wrapped by bubble wrap. There was no plastic cover or anything of the sort.

Might just be a  mistake, and I'll be contacting them tomorrow :)"
52069,"Never received one packaged like that, but good luck."
52070,"I totally agree, those low profile volume and power buttons are sexual."
52071,"This is exactly what I have. Provides protections, doesn't make it too bulky, still shows off the gorgeous apple aspects, and cheap!"
52074,"Thirded. 

I've also been using the magpul cases since the iPhone 4. Nothing has protected my phone as well as their cases. Currently using the magpul bump case with my 5. 

I'd say the bump cases are more premium than the field cases and worth the upgrade."
52078,the fact that this doesn't come in black is a huge turnoff :(
52080,"oh, i just couldn't find that on amazon readily"
52081,"[Tech 21](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NXAL666/ref=cm_sw_r_udp_awd_eS73ub0BHXYSM)

Love this case.  I've dropped my phone multiple times.  And it's still perfectly fine.  That's being dropped on concrete, asphalt, rocks, dirt etc.  working in my field I need a case that's not too big and bulky but also protect wells.  This case is slim and stream line and feels like it's built like a tank.  When you put it on you can be worry free about drops because when it does drop it makes a completely different sound from any other case I've heard.  The sound of protection.

No cringing or winces when you see it falling to the floor in slow motion.

Edit: fixed link.  It comes in multiple colors."
52082,"I'm planning to get the Apple Leather case. I have one for my 5 and I like it a lot. Gotten a lot of compliments on the looks too.

Are you looking for something that protects it from drops too? Or just something for very basic protection like on a table or in a bag etc?"
52083,"Just returned my leather case. Had it for about a week and it was already falling apart. The leather was coming off the edges and it was bubbling on the back. No drops or anything, mostly in my pocket or sitting on my desk at work. Pretty disappointed as it's a great feeling and looking case."
52084,You could have taken it to an Apple Store and asked for a replacement. I did that with my first one and this one is like brand new since launch minus two weeks.
52085,"True but with how quickly is was falling apart on me, just had no faith in its long term reliability. It's totally possible it was a defective one but oh well. I'm going to try out the silicone one for a bit."
52086,"Like I said, my first one was similar to yours and my second one has been like new for as long as I had it. Which is basically a week or two since launch"
52087,"Bubbling? Wow... So far, for mine, the only part that has started to peel of is near the Lightning port which is kinda understandable.

I dropped the phone once and there's a very tiny chip on the left edge of the screen.

So you think the quality had dropped?"
52088,"It sounds like it might have actually been defective. I'm in seattle, where cases tend to get damp sometimes, and i know several people who have them(albeit the 5s version). Even people who have had them for pretty much a year at this point the leather itself might be worn/stained/""have a patina"" but the integrity of the case is fine. Maybe that one had a shitty glue job? that's just weird to me."
52089,"I've been using the Apple Silicon Case and so far it's been keeping my phone pretty well protected! In the past, I have also used Otterbox Defender cases, and I also really like them, especially if you're looking to make sure your phone stays in good shape."
52090,"For me Urban Armored Gear make the best cases, excellent quality and really strong.   
  
I had one on my iPhone5 and now have one on my iPhone6, dropped multiple times and not a scratch.   
  
http://www.urbanarmorgear.com/collections/all#iphone6"
52091,Be very happy with my Speck Candyshell. It's sturdy and has a nice raised lip to protect the screen when dropped.
52092,"I agree, have a Space Grey iPhone 6 with a white Speck Candyshell case. It's a great case and I think the colors go great together."
52093,Too funny. I have the white/silver iphone 6 with the black Candyshell case.

52095,"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spigen-Tough-Armor-Cover-iPhone-Gunmetal/dp/B00LL60JU8

Ive been using this for a month or so, pretty awesome so far."
52096,The reviews read really great but a case with a cutout for the Apple logo is the mark of the douche (IMHO). I loved the Spigen Neo Hybrid until the bumper broke after 3 months and Spigen support told me to pound sand.
52097,The cutout is exactly why I overlooked this case. It's too bad since it is otherwise perfect
52098,"> a cutout for the Apple logo is the mark of the douche 

yeah it's lame"
52099,"This is what I'm using. It looks amazing and fits beautifully but I don't think it would protect much in a ""phone meets concrete"" scenario. I've been fortunate not to drop it yet and it gets lots of compliments so I carry insurance in case that fateful day ever arrives."
52100,I had a Tough Armour on my 5S and it was great. Now I have an Otterbox Commuter on my iPhoen 6 though.
52101,"I have the tough armor on my 6+ after loving the one on my 5S. I always have put a skin on the back as well just because of the aforementioned logo cutout. 

Its a great case, I dropped my 5s a million times in the year I had it and it looked brand new when I sold it"
52102,"I love my [OtterBox Symmetry](http://www.otterbox.com/en-us/iphone-6/symmetry-series-case/apl28-amp600.html) case! It bears the OtterBox goodies and it is slim and protective! I've dropped it before and although it hit the back corner, it didn't hit my phone and my case bore a scar, but hey... Battle scars shows just how useful this case was! :)

EDIT: I love black/white combos and since my iPhone is silver/white, the black case was perfect. In addition, since I scratched my case due to a drop, I just had to remove some of the shaved parts that came off the case (not a lot), and since it's black you can't see the scratch.

EDIT 2: When I said ""goodies"" I meant their customer service is great. At least for that one time I dealt with them (and the only time I've done a warranty claim ever in my life). I got another case from them almost immediately in several e-mail exchanges (partly due to my mistake of accidentally sending two warranty claim e-mails)."
52103,"Yep, this is my case and it feels sturdy and manly."
52104,"I ended up ordering this case, but it feels very slippery in my hand."
52105,"It's slippery, but that's good for jean pockets, in my opinion. Although I don't feel it slipping out of my hands if that's what you meant. It's definitely not as slippery as the caseless iphone though."
52106,That is true.  I ordered the Spigen air cushion as well.  I'll see which one I like best.
52107,Okie :D I'm glad you're looking at variety though xP Good luck and return to us with a decision! :P
52108,Thule atmos x3. It's really study but still thin. I think it's the best trade off there
52109,"I use an Otterbox Defender, I love the way it looks, love the way it feels....BUT I can't really recommend it. The screen protector doesn't fit perfectly flush against the screen, it's really close but it's just not there, and as a result the touch screen can be finicky and feels like first gen touch screens. 

But the thing is, when I get my next phone I'll probably buy another Defender, my phone just feels a lot safer in one. I'm not scared to hand my phone to my 2 year old niece, I'm not worried about knocking my phone off my counter when cooking, I just feel safer with it than I do with any of the other cases I've used in the past."
52110,Mine in the same case has survived several drops and a few kicks across concrete floors and parking lots. I would recommend that you never trust the co-op to securely hold the phone though.
52111,"I also like the Defender, my 2 year old has thrown it from our second story onto wood and the phone survived without a scratch.  The case did break, but Otterbox sent a new one no charge.  As for the touchscreen, I heated up the front panel to loosen the glue and take the screen protector off... And replaced it with a glass one.  Its a little compromise with the protection, but worth it imo.  Definitely a big case and not recommended if you want something slim... But you can't beat the protection!"
52112,"I'm really liking this case http://www.pure-gear.com/shop-by-device/iphone/dualtek-extreme-shock-case-for-iphone-6.html I have it on my iphone 6+ . It's very ridged, and very protective without adding much bulk. It feels great in the hand and the sides are very grippy. 

Coupled it with a Glass Screen protector and I'm confident that it'll be safe in most instances."
52113,I love my Caudabe Veil for my 6 Plus. They make [this version](http://www.amazon.com/Caudabe-iPhone-Premium-Ultra-Black/dp/B00NH5ZXR0) as well for the 6. Great amazingly thin case. I normally go naked with my phones but decided to add something so I can set it down on hard surfaces without worrying about marking it up. Couldn't be happier with it!
52114,"I have a 6 Plus but I use this [case](http://www.incipio.com/cases/iphone-cases/iphone-6-plus-cases/dualpro-hard-shell-case-with-impact-absorbing-core-iphone-6-plus.html) I always felt the phone was a little thin and this case makes it feel perfect. Still slim but it feels sturdier. The only problem I encounter is the headphone hole is too small for a couple aux chords I have encountered, but everyone I own fits perfectly."
52115,"I too have this Incipio case for my 6 Plus and am very happy with it. It's sturdy but doesn't add too much heft or size. It's also unassuming, which I like. I found it based on a winning review from The Wirecutter: http://m.thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-iphone-6-case/"
52116,"I have tried a few but the best for me is the [clear Urban Armour Gear (UAG)](http://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-iPhone-Display/dp/B00LCAVRLS). For additional protection I also suggest the [Tech Armor Ballistic Screen Protector](http://www.amazon.com/Ballistic-Protector-Tech-Armor-Premium/dp/B00EL94RQE).

The UAG is stiff enough that I think it helps to reduce the chances of the iPhone getting bent. The UAG, especially the clear version, is not bulky but the lip is high enough to reduce the chances of damage to the screen when the phone is dropped accidentally. Word of caution though is you have to be careful when removing it as it is a tight fit."
52117,"I was looking for a more sturdy case than the Apple leather one, and the clerk at the store went deadpan, pulled his 6+ out of his pocket, and tossed it to the floor.

I gasped audibly, and he cracked up, then picked up his pristine phone off the ground in its [Tech21 ""impactology evo mesh"" case](http://www.amazon.com/Tech21-Impactology-Mesh-Iphone-Case/dp/B00P2JYHH6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1423946126&sr=8-2&keywords=tech21+evo+mesh). I bought one on the spot, and have used it ever since with great satisfaction (though I haven't had the guts to throw my phone to the ground yet). $30 on Amazon, though I think I paid a bit more at the Apple Store."
52118,[Corners 4.](http://www.corners4.com)
52119,This looks really interesting. Do these stay on pretty well?
52120,"The Lifeproof case is great, it's saved my phone from several 4 foot drops onto tile,concrete, asphalt....
It's much slimmer than the 5 version too.  It adds just enough thickness that the phone feels less flimsy!"
52121,Really wish they'd release the 6 nuud case already.
52122,I've got one of these on the way after my experience with the 4S Lifeproof case. I've heard that there is some muffling of the earpiece. Have you experienced that?
52123,No problems with that so far...
52124,"I can barely hear mine on speaker if there is any ambient noise. The earpiece is the same, if not worse. I use a Bluetooth headset 90% of the time, though, so it doesn't usually bother me. It tends to depend on the case, though."
52125,I've had really good luck with both the Spigen Tough Armor and Slim Armor.  I'd highly recommend them
52126,"i use the avawo folio case, and i like it a lot. for my last phone, i had a large protective case (like an otter box), but i could not fit it in my pocket. the avawo case is sleek, i'm able to prop up the phone with it, and with the wallet style of it, i have no problem putting it in my pocket."
52127,"I have an [Urban Armor Gear case.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/URBAN-ARMOR-iPhone-Display-White/dp/B00LCAVWBI/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1423942095&sr=1-7&keywords=urban+armor+gear+iphone+6) It doesn't add a lot of bulk, its pretty damn solid but the only real problems I have with it are:  
  
1. It has these two holes in the back which I do think let some dust in between the case and the phone. And...  
2. I actually have no idea how to get the phone out of the case without breaking a nail (I feel like I'll bend my phone if I try too hard), it snapped in so damn tight and I haven't even tried taking it out in fear of bending my iPhone.  
All in all though, definitely prevents your screen from flat out hitting the ground if you drop it and it has nice protection around the corners in case you do drop it."
52128,I think spigen is an exceptional case manufacturer and it's built quality is top-notch! I use a neo metal hybrid for my daily case needs! I couldn't ask for more! Perfect balance between bulkyness and protection and it has aluminum too!
52129,"I really like my roocase: http://www.amazon.com/roocase-iPhone-KAPSUL-Military-Protector/dp/B00LGXHH3S/ref=sr_1_3?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1423943345&sr=1-3&keywords=roocase

Already dropped my phone like 5 times, no damage. Not too bulky."

52131,Here is in my opinion the best case: [SCENG GUNDAMN](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S5EHW1I/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A17VZ59ISPUS0V)
52132,Really loving my simple [Incipio](http://www.amazon.com/Incipio-NGP%C2%AE-iPhone-6-Black/dp/B00MHWSNR6) - it's the top rated pick from The Wirecutter.  Had one for my 4S for almost three years and looked new and have been using one for my 6 for six months now with no complaints.
52133,"I too have the iIncipio but I'm in the market for a new case. For me, the case just adds too much bulk, I want something now with a lot less bulky but with some protection."
52134,"If you're about straight protection... I still think Otter Box is the gold standard.  My old 4 fell off a three story building and hit concrete, the Otter left not a scratch.

But if you like something with a bit more style, my 5 is in a [Grovemade](http://grovemade.com/collections/case) wooden case that I think is super slick.  Clearly not as solid as Otter, but it's a bit slimmer and I love the styling."
52135,"I'm pretty happy with my Otterbox Commuter. Gives good protection without feeling overly-bulky. Not a massive fan of the Apple logo cutout, though."
52136,"http://www.shopbugatti.com/en-us/product/detail/watch-brown-leather-case-iphone-6#prettyPhoto

I have a similar one for my iPhone 5.  It's super stylish and durable."
52137,"i bought [this](http://www.mytrendyphone.eu/shop/iphone-6-ballistic-138329p.html)(which in the US, is an [AT&T exclusive](http://www.att.com/cases/ballistic-glitter-jewel-iphone-case-for-iphone-6.html) it seems like. only linked that weird eu site because it was the only place with a good picture) kind of as a joke, and a temporary case while i found one i liked. I ended up loving it. It's really slim, except at the corners. It elevates the phone off of a surface quite a bit(like probably 5mm) if the screen is face down. Stays on good, doesn't stick to my pocket. 

Also it looks *hilarious*. Everyone has something to say about it, or at least does a double take. 

The 6 versions of cases i've liked in the past, like the candyshell just did nothing for me. I'm debating getting something like a grovemade, miniot, or iwooden... but this case is actually pretty nice. It's like one of those super thin TPU cases, but with corner, drop, and face down fall protection. And it only bulks up the phone at the corners. Also it's hilarious."
52138,Is everyone against Flip cases or something??
52139,"Tech 21 cases are what I've used exclusively for the past year, and I used to buy two or three cases every month. They provide great protection, I like the way that they look, and they don't ever get that dirty or look worn. Can't say enough good things about them, especially the Evo Mesh series for the 6."
52140,"I've been using an Incipio NGP for almost two months. Doesn't stick to pockets or gather lint, has a slightly grippy feel, and is relatively cheap. I'm actually considering getting another one in a different color to mix it up sometimes."
52141,"I love my wooden case.

I just think it's sexy and has protected my phone very well."
52142,"I almost always get Speck CandyShells, but I wish they'd get the FLIPs out so I can get the damn thing on and off without so much huffing and puffing."
52143,"I personally use lifeproof frē and love it. It gives me a better grip on the phone since it's flat on the sides and protects the phone from drops, water and snow. It's a bit pricey but better than buying a new phone if you drop it"
52144,Has anyone ever tried one of [these](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Dual-Hybrid-0-5mm-Metal-Aluminum-Bumper-Back-Cover-For-iphone-6-Moblie-Phone-Cases-For/32262330658.html)?
52145,"I just ordered the Shumuri Slim Extra for my 6, haven't received it yet. But excited. My go-to case right now is the Incipio NGP. Provides the perfect amount of protection, grip, and covers all sides. I love my Apple Silicone case too just hate that it doesn't protect the bottom of the phone. If it wrapped the whole phone that would be the only case I use."

52148,"I'll second the Apple leather case. I've had one in navy blue for a couple of months now, and it's the first time I've preferred an iPhone in a case rather than carrying it naked. Doesn't add much thickness and has a great feel. Like you said, only downside is the price."

52153,"I'm a huge fan of the Spigen Liquid Air cases, been using them since the iPhone 6+. 15 bucks and they last about 3 years. They give both screen and lens protection in that the edges around the front and around the camera are raised enough to protect both. The cases also don't add much bulk to the phone and the rear is textured for easy grip."
52154,"A lot of votes for Spigen, thanks"
52155,Been using a spigen case on my Xs for three years.
52156,"I agree the one says ""Spending $1000+ on a phone, don’t cheap out on the case.""  I need a case with strong protection for I drop the iphone 13 a lot, case with built in screen protector, shockproof at least 2 meters!  https://lvmous.com/collections/iphone-13-waterproof-case"

52971,"**Smif-N-Wessun - Dah Shinin**. My favourite 90s New York rap album, which is definitely my favourite location/time period. The production by the Beatminerz is flawless, pure hiphop essence, with some of the best and hardest basslines hiphop has ever seen, hard drums and often fantastic and beautiful samples. Tek & Steele aren't the most lyrical MCs but they compensate with an array of hard flows and great chemistry.

Favourite songs: Let's Git It On, Bucktown, Stand Strong, Sound Bwoy Bureill, Timz N Hood Chek

**Sean Price - Monkey Barz**. My favourite rappers best album imo. Varied production but good through-out, with appearances from 9th Wonder and Khrysis, but for the 16 songs there are 12 producers. This somehow works pretty well, with many great beats that all serve as a challange for Sean P to tackle. Sean is on his best shit here, his flow is still pretty fast compared to later years, but he has certainly already grown into more of a character than he was in Heltah Skeltah's early years. 1000 ways to murder you rap paired with being pretty drugged out (*""E-pills, mushrooms, and dust /
Got that nigga Sean Price in the mood to bust""*), it makes for every verse to be pretty entertaining. Every verse has you laughing like he's cracking jokes then worried he'll punch you the next second. Some dope features too, including Rockness on Slap Boxing.

Favourite songs: Onion Head, Boom Bye Yeah, Heartburn, Slapboxing, Fake Neptune


**Organized Konfusion - Stress: The Extinction Agenda**. Pharoahe Monch is insane as an MC, and Prince Po is still great- to the point that if he was rapping like this on almost any other album, he'd steal the show. This whole album is a manifesto of unconventional flows, switching every few bars without ever slipping up. Additionally, the concepts are interesting and carried out in a great way. 'Stray Bullet' for example is a song written entierly from the view of a bullet, a concept Nas flipped for the perspective of a Gun, some years later. The beats aren't groundbreaking, but they do serve as great, typical '93 east coast soundscapes for Prince Po and Pharoahe Monch to go crazy.

Favourite Songs: Bring It On, Stress, Stray Bullet, Why, The Extinction Agenda

**DJ Screw - Blue Over Grey**. Really just a symbollic record for my love for DJ Screws music. I don't think any tape is particulary high above another, or at least not to an extreme extent; there are many others I'd be happy to put as #1 too. But this tape is one of his more grimey and heavy ones, especially one of the earlier songs, *Love Ones* is stupidly hard, a mix of an Ice Cube track of the same name, stretched out for over 10 minute and it's dumb hard and loud. DJ Screw when you're stoned is where it's at. 

Favourite songs: LoveOnes. That's it, everything else melts together consistently, in a great way. 

**DJ Shadow - Endtroducing . . . .**  My favourite instrumental hiphop album period. So many amazing samples, so many perfect songs. The drums on *Midnight in a Perfect World* are flawless to me, probably my favourite drums in any hiphop track, much thanks to how good that snare sounds. Great scratces, very atmospheric sound that's great if you're travelling or self reflecting, or just chilling even. Lots of the songs feel pretty nostalgic. 

Favourite songs: Midnight in a Perfect World, Building Steam With a Grain of Salt, Organ Donor, Napalm / Scatter Brain, Mutual Slump"

52985,That cLOUDDEAD album is a classic. You fuck with Reaching Quiet or Hymie's Basement at all?
52986,"I like every tape that Odd has put out, but cLOUDDEAD will always be special for me the same way that College Dropout was. Moreso than any of their later projects I think that album had the most specific killer tone for that phase of my life. The dreamy, drunken flow from one thing to the next with the entire project feeling hopelessly lost with how much information they try to cover. 

Discovered that album when I was drifting between college classes feeling like a corpse/colossal fuckup. So much of the lyricism on that album stuck to me as somebody who had always been in love with hip hop flow/beats but didn't relate to the subject matter much at all due to my whiteness and disconnect from either coastal region culture. 

When I got older and more exposed to other people telling their stories I found more to relate to in traditional hip hop but for a long time cLOUDDEAD was my shit. 

There's something

To the fading of faith

My whole childhood

Was the broken guitar

And my sister's silly

Yellow blanket

Now I carry

Slender and sexy curved

Sledge hammers

To break the bricks

I bought

I should have never went to college

But took a trip to Costa Rica

To cut rainforests

To choke myself



Damn that shit brings back memories."

52997,"Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy

I was a fan of Ye since College Dripout but interest in him waned when 808 came out because I was in my ""real hip-hop"" phase. This album along with the the G.O.O.D Fridays tracks turned me into a stan. It's a masterpiece. The beats were epic and this was Kanye lyrically at his best. Easily my favorite album of all time.

Common - BE

Common's poetic lyricism, Kanye's soul sampling, John Legend lending his talents and a live performance on the Chappelle's show. What's not to love.

Ludacris - Chicken & Beer

Luda is an underrated lyricist and ""Hip Hop Quotables"" is a good example of that. Also , it's just a hood ass album. I know my mom got tired of me blasting Blow It Out. 

Danny Brown - XXX

I like it because we get the glorification of drug culture from someone who's also a victim of it and Pac Blood gives me chills whenever I hear that chorus. I love it because it gave us a pussy eating anthem and I never looked at Cool Ranch doritoes the same way ever again.

Jay Z - 444

This is a more mature Sean exercising his lyrical muscles while spitting out nuggets of wisdom. My favorite song off this changes every time I listen to it. We can talk about the social commentary and his personal life, but really, it's just great raps over dope beats."

Both of these artists I’ve been high on since they dropped singles for these albums. Very excited to see Paris Texas grab traction now touring with Brockhampton, but don’t really understand how Van Buren Records has been so overlooked. Their grungy vibe with trading off verses reminds me so much of HEAT or STAR from Brockhampton. I haven’t really seen anyone check them out and highly suggest people do, as their album is one of my favorites this year"
53010,"people really sleeping on that Van Buren Records project. If anyone is on the fence/not sure if they'd like it, here's what Passion of the Weiss wrote about it:

>One of the most talked-about Massachusetts hip-hop acts this year has been Van Buren Records, a collective based out of Brockton. They’ve received co-signs from the biggest names in MA rap and beyond, and for good reason. Some of the individual members have shown tremendous promise. Lord Felix, who dons a large mirrored visor when performing, put out several projects this year that showcase a knack for house-influenced rap. And Jiles projects as a no-frills spitter. His debut album Fuck Jiles has the ethos of a Jay Rock record.

>Others in Van Buren aren’t as far along in their careers. Saint Lyor has only two songs to his name, but he’s clearly onto something. The second one, “Gossip,” might be one of the best songs that anyone in the crew has recorded. It has the feel of a Baby Keem song, but it’s more believable than anything Keem has done. The whole crew pulled up to the video shoot at Brockton High School and clearly had fun with it. Check for Van Buren all 2020."
53011,"There's so many incredible rappers from MA, it's a crime the state so slept on. Van Buren, Oompa, Cliff Notez, Dutch Rebelle, Millyz, STL GLD, Red Shaydez, Cakeswagg, Brandie Blaze, SeeFour, Monavelli, Billy Dean Thomas. Literally any type of vibe you would want."

Her & Nappy Nina are pretty cool w/ each other & that’s how I got put on; maassai’s verse on “Modestly” is supreme.  Between that & “gold & smiles” I was sold & was like bet, let’s see. 

It took me 2 listens to really mesh w/ it & I’d suggest for anybody who checks it out.

*I haven’t peeped that 454 & it looks like I’m bound to cause weird & plugg in one is up my alley for sure."
53037,That 454 album is crazy good
53038,"Hah, perfect timing, I just finished listening to it & I def agree. The Middle 4 is the weakest section to me & still good, “Brazil” & “Heaven”being the good ones; it starts and end great tho.  

I can’t pick favs yet, but if I had to pick 3, be “Late Night”, “Brazil”, & “Sincerely”.

I think if people enjoy SahBabii & could take just a bit more weird & a higher voice, then they’ll vibe w/ this pretty well."
53039,"Damn I really like Andretti too tho. Caprice probably weakest song for me.

I gotta check out SahBabii if they sound like this cuz I really love this sound"
53040,"Yeh it’s not a bad song; there’s nothing I really dislike off this tape.  I’m just not really big on its hook & it takes up a good bitta space on that track.  

I think it also suffers by being next to Caprice after that strong 4 song run at the intro & then being right before one my favs, “Brazil”, which marks the return to quality again.  I’ma Spitta Andretti fan tho so it all works out.

& yeh SahBabii was the 1st closer to widely known artist I could think’f that’d provide some sort of similarity.  He’s very Thug influenced, but beat selection & overall sound, I think if people rocked w/ SahBabii then they’d rock w/ this too.

Here’s 1 from each his albums to checkout & see if you’ll dig his stuff,

[Cracks & Crevices ](https://youtu.be/1C2IQmc5rd0)

[Barnacles](https://youtu.be/7IIbM7Xlnyo)

[Anime World](https://youtu.be/Yov5Q-JEM8o)

If ya like those, then you’ll prolly dig their associated albums too.  Squidtastic as an album will be the weakest of the 3 tho imo."
