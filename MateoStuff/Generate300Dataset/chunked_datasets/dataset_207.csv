68349,"Surprised not to see Hyperion on the list.

Edit: Duh. it's there. MY BAD."
68350,"It's very fantasy-influenced compared to a lot of these other novels. It's set in the future but the science take a very big back seat to the fiction.

That being said Hyperion Cantos is one of my all time favorite series and Dan Simmons is an exquisite writer."
68351,The Shrike is the baddest baddie in sci Fi.  I really loved how obsessed and self absorbed martens Silenus was. So many great characters. I started with The fall of Hyperion. Endymion and the last book kind of lost steam though
68352,"Surely you read the first book; Hyperion? The way that the pilgrims' stories are told was very clever, and Sol's story alone makes the book one of my favorites."
68353,"The way the priests tale is told was absolutely perfect, especially as someone with a lot of experience from faith circles."
68354,"I've read those series so many times that I forget about some of the massive leaps he takes in the 'sci-fi' parts.

&#x200B;

Then again in Olympos/Illium"
68355,"Re-reading that right now. I love how it's bordering on the fantastically surreal in so many places, but always with just enough foundation to remain believable.

(Did I just say Foundation? Pure coincidence. Very different series, also great.)"
68356,It is on there as the Hyperion Cantos.
68357,"I *love* A Fire Upon the Deep and all of Vinge's stuff. The sort of sequel, A Deepness in the Sky, is great as well. He has such brilliant ideas. 

I'm surprised The Three-Body Problem isn't on that list!"
68358,"> I'm surprised The Three-Body Problem isn't on that list!

The list is several years old, so it pre-dates a few highly recommended reddit crazes like *The Three-Body Problem* and *The Martian*. I've read those and loved them, but haven't gotten to the rest of the Three-Body trilogy."
68359,"I truly enjoyed \*The Three-Body Problem\*.  I started \*The Dark Forest\* and honestly walked away from it just shy of halfway through.  Then a friend told me I had missed the best part, so I went back and finished it -- and was extremely glad that I did.

I got around to asking my public library to get the third book, \*Death's End,\* on cd (this is how I ""read"" the first two).  I'm very glad I did.  I'm about 1/4 way in (it's significantly longer than the first two), and it's *really* good.  While Liu's backstory storytelling can get a little dense at times, he keeps throwing out events and occurrences that I ""didn't see coming.""  There are a LOT of shoes left to drop in this story, from where I am in it now.  Highly recommended."
68360,"I liked that series a ton (you can tell by my user name, I bet). Death's End was my favorite, I think. Hard to rank them, but it got so damn interesting by the second half."
68361,I highly recommend finished the *Remembrance of Earth's Past* series (Three-Body Trilogy). The scope expands with each book and it gets so interesting. Highly recommend finishing it!
68362,Thank you! I bought ‘A Fire Upon the Deep’ straight away. You never know what you’ll discover this way. Looking forward to discovering a new author :-)
68363,That's awesome! I hope you enjoy it! I'm enjoying the fact that this thread has turned into a bit of a love fest for *A Fire Upon the Deep*.
68364,Vinge is a sleeper hit.
68365,"I'm a huge KSR fan - The Mars Trilogy is great.  Years of Rice and Salt is also amazing.  I can also suggest Galileo's Dream and his short stories which are collected.

I'm not into his more recent works as much and the Science in the Capitol series has some good ideas but is take it or leave it."
68366,*The Years of Rice and Salt* is my absolute favourite alternate history novel.
68367,It's been years since I read it but from what I recall The Mote in God's Eye has a great underlying concept and powers through largely based on that. It's an interesting read but Niven and Pournelle do really badly on (human) characterisation. Niven is pretty good on constructing believable aliens though – and I assume Niven was largely responsible for the portrayal of the Moties.
68368,"I have a shelf full of Niven, and the guy has always wrapped amazing sci-fi ideas around the crummiest pulp characters."
68369,"I've noticed that Niven is REALLY hard for me to read on his own - the original Ringworld series was such a slog for me.   When he has a coauthor, though, the books definitely flow a lot more smoothly."
68370,"Niven has interesting ideas, pulp execution and his biology sucks."
68371,"The Mote in God's Eye is set years after a cataclysmic event that nearly wiped out humanity, and the culture that survived has in some ways become very conservative, reflecting militaristic Victorian-era morals.  These morals are never really questioned throughout the book, which to modern readers makes it seem like the authors personally agree with it.  I'm not sure that's actually the case (although Pournelle apparently had strongly conservative political views, so who knows)."
68372,"> (although Pournelle apparently had strongly conservative political views, so who knows).

That's a bit of an understatement."
68373,"I'll defend Niven on The Mote in God's Eye since I recently re-read it.  

Sally is on the ship because she was touring planets as an anthropologist exploring the more primitive cultures left after humanity's first empire collapsed.  She is shown as extremely capable, is a political figure as a senator's niece and heir to several titles, and is a scientist.  The major setting of the novel is military, so it's something of a given that there will be few women.  This is flipped on its head though for the moties.  Without spoiling the plot of the book, the aliens and their sexual biology play a huge role in their society and it acts as something of a mirror to humanity showing how locked-in gender roles could be if our biology were different.

Far from being a damsel, Sally is critical in both the plot and the ship's mission of investigating the aliens.  And while the culture of the second empire is conservative in regards to women, Sally is very aware of this due to her academic profession and is adamant about not losing her position of power and autonomy by marrying just some noble.  Again, without spoiling the plot of the book, she does marry but voluntarily for love despite other political entanglements.  I wouldn't say the morals of the society aren't questioned so much as they are rationalized by what the society has survived, namely a huge drop in population and near collapse of civilization.


Edit: Forgot to include another point in Sally's favor.  While it is glossed over far too quickly, Sally was on a planet that revolted and was put in a concentration camp before the novel's start.  There she was THE leader of the camp prisoners and did her best to help them survive, often sacrificing her own well being.  So yeah, she's the only woman, but she's a hell of a woman."
68374,"> which to modern readers makes it seem like the authors personally agree with it.

They were both very conservative, and weren't shy about saying so on forums and so forth, so it's a pretty fair conclusion."
68375,Both of them are very conservative. You can also look at another book they wrote together (Lucifer's Hammer) that was released around the same time to get an understanding of their beliefs.
68376,"An interesting aspect of The Mote In God's Eye, which is easy to miss today, is how the humans use computers and manage information. They all have pocket computers, linked to a massive central network of facts, recordings, etc., and each room has a huge flat screen that they can use to look at shared information. It's basically how information technology works today.

But the book was published in 1974! Before Apple, before Microsoft, before the IBM PC. Niven and Pournelle once said that they considered all the computer stuff to be as fantastical as the idea of making contact with aliens."
68377,"Characters are definitely Niven's biggest weakness. He is a big idea guy. I loved Ringworld, but if you held a gun to my head I couldn't tell you what the characters wanted or how they developed. The individuals just left no impression on me. Ringworld is basically a glorified travel guide but it works."
68378,*Footfall* started me on Niven/Pournelle. I prefer it to the Mote universe.
68379,"Solaris by Stanislaw Lem is pretty great imo.

&#x200B;

That said, most of my favorite science-fi stories are in the form of short stories. Ray Bradbury's ""Martian Chronicles"" and ""The Illustrated Man"" are both classics. Harlan Ellison's ""Shatterday"" is another good one. Any collection of short stories by Asimov or Clarke are good choices too.

&#x200B;

I think the form of the short story allows writers to explore a theme or concept without having to build a 300 page long narrative around it, and this helps them focus on higher concepts without having to worry too much about fully realizing characters or subplots, or settings, or whatever."
68380,"Ted Chiang's ""Stories of Your Life and Others"" would be a good candidate for this list. His stories make me *think* in a way most science fiction doesn't — his ideas are so, so original and really stretch beyond the tired tropes you find in other sci-fi."
68381,How are there no Culture novels by Ian M. Banks on the top list?!
68382,"Perhaps he suffers from the fact that no-one can agree on his best book. There isn't a standout single book that everyone recommends. I remember a ""Britains favourite books"" TV show from 10-25 years ago, Terry Pratchett didn't get near the top 10, but did have about a dozen books in the top 200."
68383,Excession.
68384,"And I've also seen people suggest Player of Games, Consider Phlebas and Use of Weapons. And possibly one or two others."
68385,"Player of Games is usually cited as the best way to enter the series or a favorite, but I think more suggest Use of Weapons and Excession as his greatest works more often."
68386,"I liked matter more, as a stand-alone entry to the culture. It has stellar density, and it heats up nicely"
68387,">*The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass... when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you've just been discovered, you're all subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.*"
68389,That's really insightful.
68390,"I think Use of Weapons and Player of Games are the two that people usually pick as their favorite; I'm finishing up Hydrogen Sonata, and it's actually making me really sad that I'll never get to read a Culture novel for the first time again :("
68391,"Oh good, Im glad Im not alone with this thought, I just finished Excession and it was the last one I had left to read so naturally Im going through the mourning stage of finishing a book series by a dead author.

  
Excellent books and really a refreshing look at AI. I am so tired of the ""evil-AI is going to enslave/kill mankind"" tropes present in many other sci-fi."
68392,"The level of freedom the Drones and Minds had in the Culture series made me look much more critically at other media and how they present their AIs. Star Wars is a huge offender in that regard. In fact the droid L3 in Solo: A Star Wars story was a masterful, refreshing breeze compared to how they treat droids."
68393,Consider Meatfucker...
68395,"That's because his best book, The Algebraist, isn't a Culture novel."
68396,I just re--read Use of Weapons for the third time. Absolutely phenomenal book. Working through player of games at the moment. Some of the most amazing books I've ever read.
68397,And it has the best hat joke *ever*
68398,"Someone introduced me to this series last year, and I'm already about half way through. Enjoying it immensely."
68399,"I'm of the opinion that *Book of the New Sun* is the greatest work of science fiction ever written. I'm also of the opinion that it is not for everyone.  The enjoyment comes only when you're a fan of long, staring-out-the-window-on-a-rainy-day reflection between chapters (sometimes even between paragraphs).  You have to enjoy exegesis to truly find joy in the reading experience; the story is more staggering and emotional the more the reader is inclined to these kinds of habits. But people read for different reasons and people internalize stories different ways so it's just not for everyone.  Glad someone read it and found it interesting, though!"
68400,"I'm really all over the place with that one. On the one hand I was bored, on the other hand, it's the first time I used my kindle's highlight feature. ""A crowd is not the sum of the individuals who compose it. Rather it is a species of animal, without language or real consciousness, born when they gather, dying when they depart."" I mean, damn."
68401,"Kind of an interesting intersection with that and this quote I picked up from Dune, which I finally read recently: ""A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob."""
68402,">Kind of an interesting intersection with that and this quote I picked up from Dune, which I finally read recently: ""A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.""

I really like that quote. I feel like it's something everyone should try to remind themselves of, because when you are an individual, you *are* ***your*** leader."
68403,"Well, that's certainly food for thought..."
68404,"I'm surprised Delany's Dhalgren wasn't on the list. I just started it, it's pretty dense but I'm enjoying it. Anyone else finish it?"
68405,"I read it a while ago and I thought it was on the list, but I had gotten it from another one. I thought it was an interesting work of art and I never want to force myself through a book like that again."
68406,I loved reading books 1 and 2 as odd adventures and world building.  Book 3 felt the most aimless.  But book 4 is what ties everything together and reveals the wonderful intricacies of its puzzle.  It's  also a series that greatly rewards rereading.
68407,"This is spot on from my experience, as well. Book 4 really needs to be read to get the full experience.

I'd only read these for the first time a couple of years ago, but it's definitely on my short list for a re-read."
68408,"Book 3 is where the real change happens though. It's where his suffering and loss act as a crucible, where he loses his crutches, where he opens himself up to his potential. 

It's the hardest book of the 4 (or 5 depending on how you fit in the coda). But it's also the one is central to what went before and after for Severian.

My opinion of course. Just nice to discuss TBOTNS."
68409,"I would strongly recommend you read the 5th book, Urth of the New Sun. I think it's technically considered a sequel, but it's really more of an epilogue that revisits the events of the previous books and shines light on what really happened in key moments. It completely changed the way I saw the first four books and in my opinion, the story is not complete without it."
68410,"I liked the first four, but actually didn't enjoy the fifth book as much. I think I was missing a lot of the symbolism or something, but it just wasn't as enjoyable for me."
68411,"Gene Wolfe is an amazing author.  If you're a fan, and haven't read his recent(ish) short story anthology (The Best of Gene Wolfe), you really need to!"
68412,"I'm in agreement with u/VanyaKmzv.

Book of the New Sun is my favorite series of all time. I read the first two books in highschool and found it incredibly interesting but couldn't stick through to the end. I started it over again as an adult and just couldn't put it down. Once you lock in to Gene Wolfe's imagination, his writing becomes so incredibly clear and his characters all have a uniqueness to them that I don't see replicated often. I got busy with work and need to get back into the Sun books, but Long Sun is also amazing. Someday I'll finish it and read Short Sun."
68413,"So, another thing on BotNS:   By not finishing it you're not just missing what happens in the remaining books, but also stuff from the books you've already read that don't really get proper context until the later books.  It's for that reason that many have said that the series is more enjoyable on a re-read since then you're more in the know as to what's going on around Severian from the get-go and can even [minor spoiler](#s ""spot a some places where Severian fudges his own narrative to make himself look better to the reader"").  

Also, the next series in the cycle, Book of the Long Sun, is much more enjoyable to read from a plot perspective and the last, Book of the Short Sun, is where shit gets even more weird and eventually completes the full Solar Cycle."
68414,"It's my favourite sci-fi book, and possibly my favourite book of all genres."
68415,"Just like Terminus Est, the series is a double edged sword.  While I think it's the best sci-fi I've read, it also ruined other books for me.  The complex, layered story that doesn't outright tell you everything is so far from other author's works that they seem simple and less interesting.

It took a while after finishing that series before I could pick up other sci-fi books and truly enjoy them.  I just had to accept that they're a straight line, skin deep story before I could enjoy that story and those ideas.

If the narrator (Severian) says he has a perfect memory, but misremembers something, it's only up to the reader to figure that out.  The book doesn't outright beat you over the head with it.  And then you have to wonder what else might be false.

Other books will just tell you a character is lying or wrong before the sentence is even complete, because heaven forbid the reader not immediately know that."
68416,"Haha, yeah, it took me ages as well to get back into reading ""normal"" books, where the story/plot/narrative is all you've got. 

Wolfe is so multi-layered that most other fiction seems so very simple afterwards.

I've not really found anything else like it. David Mitchell is pretty good but in a different way. Hannu Rajaniemi is also excellent, and has that multi layered complexity. But neither are actually very similar, or repay in the same way the rereads Wolfe does. 

Vance though shows where Wolfe came from, and his language shaped Wolfe's for sure. Look for the word ""oubliette"" in Vance, then see the way other authors in this tradition use it as well. If oubliette is in a speculative fiction novel, the you're almost certainly reading a Vance and Wolfe fan."
68417,"I don't know that I can get behind ""greatest work of science fiction ever written"" but those four books definitely return to the forefront of my mind multiple times per year, probably multiple times per month - that's much more often than many of the accepted classics do (I almost never really return to thinking about *Foundation* for example).  


Sure, the intricate layers of the story and the way it reads as an entirely different sort of novel by the end are critical features, but I think people overlook  Wolfe's talents as a prose stylist - this is probably part of what the above Redditor was getting at with the highlight feature. Wolfe has a way of making the interplay of the words themselves captivating to me. Really I can only think of Mieville and Catling as his contemporaries there (hell, maybe McCarthy is a more apt comparison), but I'd love to find a few more writers in that vein."
68418,"I can't believe Kevin J. Anderson is on this list, and not Poul Anderson. :)"
68419,Fully agree. I think his books are dreadfully written. The Dune books he co-authored completely ignore the character motivations established by Frank Herbert and are ludicrous.
68420,"I had a similar experience with Cloud Atlas. Took me three times over the course of a year to get through Pt 1, but once I did, I was intrigued with the shifting style.

But once you hit the halfway point, it's non-stop roller coaster. The first half is just that slow climb.

One of my favorite books of the 21st century."
68421,"Reading downhill is how I'd describe the second half of Cloud Atlas. The way the ending of each section cascades into the next is absolutely beautiful.

Cloud Atlas is one of my all time favourites. I've read all of Mitchell's books. I'm assuming you've read Ghostwritten and The Bone Clocks. They're all tied together but those are the most similar. 

Also doesn't Cloud Atlas make you want to hear Frobisher's piece of music so badly? I hope one day some talented person will write it and it will be perfect."
68422,What did you think of *A Canticle for Leibowitz?*
68423,Not OP but that's one of my favorites. Very influential. I love the way you don't realize that it's a sci-fi book at first. I think it's one of those books that you have to read twice.
68424,"Nice, I haven't met a lot of people who have read it. Really loved it.

Any recommendations for similar books? Always a sucker for the post-apocalyptic."
68425,A somewhat similar book is Stephenson's *Anathem*. Cloistered academic monks. I really don't want to say anything else but it is one of my favorite books.
68426,"I haven’t read anything post apocalyptic that approaches Canticle—maybe because, like LOTR did with fantasy, it so defined the genre for a while that everything else seemed derivative. Really, only The Road seems to approach its feeling of spiritual precipice.  So much of the rest just iterates survival strategies, or cool postmodern steampunk sex."
68427,"World Made by Hand by American James Kunstler was pretty good. Station Eleven was fantastic; I stayed up all night reading that one. Oryx and Crake was entertaining but I don't think it was all that deep; Handmaid's Tale was the kind of book that I sometimes have creepy dreams about and wake up sweating. The Road is iconic -- I read that one in the woods at night and got so freaked out that I hid from the fireflies. A Boy and His Dog is also, I mean, Harlan Ellison, dang... his short fiction is so weird and so warped. You can't go wrong with short stories by Ray Bradbury or James Tiptree either. Plus Tiptree is so feminist, I can't believe nobody figured out he was a woman for so long. Akira is like the most epic manga ever, plus the art is amazing. It took me forever to read because I spent so much time looking at all the details in the pictures.

Hm, maybe I read too much apocalyptic stuff... I think that Liebowitz was what started it back when I was in high school, plus I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."
68428,"I am a long time sci-fi reader and this book is by far the least liked book I have ever read. I just hated it throughout. Slow, plodding, obvious, irritating, boring. I had to finish it but it was torture all the way. Fuck those stupid monks. Clearly it works for many others."
68429,Can I ask your opinion on Stranger in a Strange Land?
68430,"Not OP, but that was one of my favorite books for a very long time. That whole deconstruction of humanity by a human raised by non-humans, his discovery of laughter, so damn powerful.

After my 5th or 6th time reading it, a lot of the flaws started peaking through. It's more than a little sexist, which is a big problem in sci-fi, and the final act was a bit...*culty*."
68431,">a bit

That's really generous of you. It was so culty I was uncomfortable reading the end part of the book. 

&#x200B;"
68432,IKR? I can't believe L. Ron Hubbard came up with his own cult and Heinlein didn't.
68433,"What did you think about the dark tower series? You read all 7 (8) books, correct?"
68434,I only read the first one and I hated it so much I'll probably never pick up another King book in my life.
68435,"Read the first, its weirdness intrigued me. Kept going because I had heard so much bullshit about how great of a series it was.  Would have burned the books when I got to the end of the series if I had read paperbacks. I am still disappointed I put myself thtough that."
68436,"A Sci-Fi must read list with no Ballard.

...my god."
68438,It is head-and-shoulders above any of the other Halo books and handily beats the Warhammer 40k books as well (and those are generally a high bar for game adaptation novels). Nylund is a rare talent in that space.
68439,How did you like the Baroque Cycle?
68440,"I need to re-read A Fire Upon the Deep at some point...for some reason I don't remember that much of it...no doubt if I re-read it, all of it would come back to me."
68441,I gave \*Red Mars\* a try and it just didn't grab me.
68442,"Dude. I know. I finished it, got halfway through green mars and thought “I can’t do this. It’s too slow”. 

I’m sad because I am a Mars nut and I appreciate this work is the epitome of “what if we terraformed mars” but....urgh....too slow."
68443,I just realized that Cloud Atlas and Atlas Shrugged are not the same books. And only after being flabbergasted that you couldn't put Atlas Shrugged down. 😂
68444,"Ok, that's really funny."
68445,I made it through most of Galt's monologue and never went back.
68446,"I haven’t seen the list, but have you read “Use of Weapons” by Iain Banks?"
68447,"Banks has nothing on there, it's a travesty! I'd recommend ""Use of Weapons"" and ""Consider Phlebas"" very very strongly."
68448,Excession made me realise that i just wanted more stories about Minds
68449,"Player of Games, too!"
68450,You should read *The Expanse* series as well.  They're quite good.
68451,"I first read ""antarctica"" by Kim Stanley Robinson, after that I basically got sucked into months of reading the whole mars trilogy, then 2312 (doh, forgot the year), then Aurora. I haven't actually tried his historical fiction books, but I've heard great things.

Also in an interview I believe Robinson cited ""Book of the Long Sun"" as one of his favorite Sci-fi books, not sure if that's part of the same series or what with Gene Wolfe, but I may have to give that a read too. Thanks for this post!"
68452,I just read New York 2012 a couple weeks ago (Robinson’s newest). It’s worth checking out.
68453,"Aurora was my favorite of his. I also read 2312, and it was ok. I liked how egalitarian it was, but the central narrative wasn't very interesting. He is great at world building. I guess that's why I liked Aurora. The world was small, and so it became more character driven by force, and with the ship as a character, I thought was awesome. I like when the robots are good. Like TARS from Interstellar."
68454,"I enjoyed the Mars Trilogy a lot, but it certainly dragged a bit here and there. I absolutely LOVED Aurora, the concept was totally new to me and the character and world building was just great too. I really enjoyed the personification of the AI and yes, good robots are way less scary! 

I've worked as the facilities engineer in the Antarctic program and I feel like the problems with keeping a multi-generational interstellar spaceship running are shockingly relatable to keeping an antarctic station running through a winter. I think his Antarctica book captures life down there better than some documentaries I've seen. 

Edited my first post: Whoops, 2312!"
68455,"Check out The Hammer of God by Arthur C Clarke. I love Clarke but people always talk about his Rama series or 2001 series, The Hammer of God is actually my favorite work of his."
68456,The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin is good.
68457,"I’ll be interested to see how your opinion of Book of the New Sun changes if you read further.  Which isn’t to say that I’m sure you’ll grow to love it—many people don’t, and it’s not personally my favorite of Wolfe’s writing—but it’s definitely as much a literary puzzle as it is a surface-level narrative, and it’s a puzzle you only have half the pieces to now.  

That said, I can definitely understand that feeling of appreciating more than enjoying it."
68458,"Can't help but join in the chorus of ""what did you think of ...?"" questions, but what did you think of *The Stars My Destination?* It's one of my favourites, but I always wonder how others will receive it since it definitely feels older in style."
68459,"I would put Connie Willis on that list (*Doomsday Book*, or *To Say Nothing of the Dog*). Richard Matheson too. And, perhaps I am biased b/c PKD is my favorite Sci-fi author, maybe a little something other than *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*. I personally think *Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said* was perhaps his best."
68460,"When you read Heinlein's Stranger in a strange land, did you read the original published version, or the uncensored version that was published after his death?  Homosexuality was not a theme to deal with in the early 1960s, at least in Science Fiction, so Heinlein had to do a bit of trimming.

I've read several on that list, started some others, and, never even heard of many, but they do look interesting."
68462,"I can’t access the list..... it keeps redirecting me to a “Fiction” list with Dr Seuss.
Is that it? I’m on my phone so perhaps it’s a platform issue...."
68463,That's the right page. The Sci-Fi is further down the page.
68465,"It's definitely not a masterpiece - and I say this as someone who's bought every book in the series. It's the literary equivalent of a fast food burger - incredibly competent, but no depth or real addition to the genre. I'm happy to read it many times, but more as a pleasant distraction than something that shapes my thought and imagination."
68466,"I'd agree with that. 

Old Man's War fits in the same place Dresden Files does personally. There are some neat ideas, the world is cool, and the writing gets the point across and is occasionally witty/funny. 

They're the ""summer action movie"" in book form. And they're fun for that."
68467,"A good comparison. They are absolutely fun (though I don't find the post-Zoe's Tale books nearly as emotionally satisfying - Harry and Hart are fine, but they don't grow, and since like most of Scalzi's characters, they're fairly flat and immature, the lack of family relationships to promote self-sacrifice and more mature actions really keeps them stuck in a box. And I know they're supposed to be bros and love each other and stuff, but it doesn't work nearly as well as John, Jane, and Zoe.)"
68468,"Your ""fast food burger"" analogy was spot on. It was interesting and entertaining but not thought provoking like Dune or the Hyperion Cantos series.....at least in my opinion."
68469,I'd imagine because *The Forever War* is already on there...
68470,"It's creative for sure, but I don't know if I'd rank it as a masterpiece. I think you also have to be interested in a specific subset of scifi to really get the most enjoyment out of it. That doesn't make it bad at all, just not something that's likely to bubble up to the top of a general list."
68471,Was there any Peter F Hamilton on the list?
68472,"Excellent world-building, especially in Pandora's Star. But his brand of space opera is too cheesy to compare with heavy hitters like LeGuin and Ishiguro."
68473,"Books do lack a certain depth, but they're enjoyable, well paced, well structured, and as you said excellent world building.  I really enjoyed MLM chapters.  And it is impossible to have a more deus ex machina ending then the nights dawn trilogy, had me chuckling for days.  His short story w/ the undergound bitek fights is great.  Good lighthearted reading."
68474,Congratulations on your magnificent achievement. In this day and age of increasingly short attention spans what you have done is an example to us all. To take such a journey into the imagination of so many books must have been rewarding. It is certainly inspirational.  In the words of Ali G big yourself up.
68475,If youre looking for more scifi Read the Iluminatus! Trilogy by Robert anton wilson.  I promise that you wont regret it.
68476,"If you're open to more Sci Fi:

The Gap Sequence; first book is ""The Real Story: The Gap Into Conflict"" by Stephen R. Donaldson. This story is basically about how, despite superfast travel, space is just too damn big to police. What happens when law cannot prevail? The first of this series the hardest book to read; the author is fantastic at putting his characters into states of nigh-unbearable tension, and book one is all about building the tension for the three main characters who comprise the handle of this umbrella of a story. Get through it, read books two through five, heave a sigh of relief that it's over. Again, very good, but tough to bear. 

Otherland: City of Golden Shadow (book one of four) by Tad Williams. A good sci-fi that plays with the dangers of virtual reality.

Old Man's War by John Scalzi. What a wild ride through the universe (?). It begins thus; ""I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army. Visiting Kathy's grave was the less dramatic of the two."" Others here have suggested that it lacks some of the depth that many sci fi greats contain, and they're not wrong. I compare it to great sci-fi like I compare home-made gourmet food to high-quality restaurant food; both are good, but one you don't really have to work for it. Just get a copy of this book and read it, then keep going through the rest of the series.

The Expanse, by James S. A. Corey. This series-cum-TV show is wonderful. Co-written by two authors, it was impossible for me to tell how they separated their work. Did one build the universe, the other the dialog? Chapter by chapter taking turns? I could never tell, it was so seamlessly written. I've heard the show is lackluster, but the books - oh, wow, the books are gripping. Again, just do it.

Charles Stross. Anything by Charles Stross. Who cares where you start (just, pick book one if it's a series). ""The Family Trade"" is a pseudo-fantasy, so if you're looking for strict sci-fi, stay away. I love Glasshouse, Iron Sunrise, Singularity Sky, and Accelerando, in particular, but it's all good.

If you enjoyed Ender's Game and the rest of the Speaker series, but were yearning for something aimed a bit more toward the Earth story, and politically thrilling, read the sister series Ender's Shadow. It follows Bean as he grows from an over-intelligent child into a truly influential figure.

Anathem, by Neal Stephenson. This sci-fi goes all philosophical on your ass, but it disguises it very well for a long time. It's hard to get into, but once this story bites you, it will NOT let go.

The Commonwealth Saga, by Peter F. Hamilton. It begins with a paired set of novels, Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained (read in that order). Hamilton takes a seemingly disparate group of characters and so elegantly braids them into a powerful yarn. Two secondary series - the Void Trilogy and a pair of books about the Abyss - take many of the same characters out and play with them after they've had time (lots of it) to grow and mature. 

Seveneves by Neal Stephenson. I'm not going to tell you a damn thing about any part of this book, at all. I'm just going to tell you to read it. If you should choose to read it, don't get the sparknotes, don't get a quick synopsis, don't read the sleeve. Allow this story to light you afire with its creativity. It is one of the most emotionally powerful sci-fi books I've read in a very long time."
68478,"I use this list. It’s user-generated and hits all of the most important sci fi.

68479,">dune is #1

Excellent. No need to bring out my pitchfork"
68480,But I need to break mine out!  *Hyperion* only #15?!?  Blasphemy!!!!
68481,Am I the only one who hated Hyperion?
68482,It was all right but not nearly as good as people on reddit make it out to be
68483,I have the exact same review for Dune.
68484,I loved Hyperion :(
68485,"Agreed. i recommended it to my cousin, and I think he's actually kinda pissed at me for doing so! I think it painted a vivid picture of a future world, but WTF is up with those last two novels?! I read them, enjoyed them, but was not blown away by anything. Even felt a little cheated by some of the outcomes ..."
68486,First book seemed to be the best.  You can stop there IIRC
68487,"But its definitely SOMETHING.  It's unique and stimulating.  It has an interesting twist.  And it's in interesting prose.  So maybe it didn't give you what you wanted, but it definitely is going to hit someone hard."
68488,"Nope. Some sections were intriguing, but overall I did not like it. I should have quit half way through, but I got caught in the literary equivalent of the sunk cost fallacy and forced myself to finish it. I thought that even though it's one book in a series, it would end with some closure and I would just stop there. Boy was I wrong. The ending had no closure and I felt like I was being jerked around to pick up the next book. If not for that, I would have felt neutral about the book instead of scammed and disgusted."
68489,"That’s why I hated it. That ending is like a slap in the face, and it’s corny as hell. The Wizard of Oz? Really? It felt like he was trying to infuriate me personally."
68490,Not at all
68491,I really liked Hyperion and HATED Fall of Hyperion. I really liked Endymion and HATED Rise of Endymion.
68493,I hated Hyperion. It was bloated and emotionless.
68494,You are not.
68495,"Nah I did too. I was enjoying the first few stories, found it intriguing, but then it all goes nowhere and has that rage inducing cliffhanger ending so you’re compelled to read the next book. Which I hated but read for the sake of completion.

By the end I felt like I’d just wasted a lot do time and got nothing out of it."
68496,It moved soooo slow.
68497,"Nah. I found it interesting, but not anywhere near my favorite sci-fi novel."
68498,"Hated?!?  

Yes, you are the only one I've ever heard express that sentiment.

Seriously.  You must be very hard to please."
68500,"See that's what makes lists bad to some extent. Sometimes a ranking has more to do with the qualities of other elements than itself. 

Personally I'd like a format similar to what r/skyrimmods does for mods. They basically have a mod ask for mods of some type or function, and then they list all these threads. You end up with list of mods of some type, genre, function with some feedback or commentary in the threads about differences or key points, but they arent really ranked"
68501,"Recently just finished the audiobook for Hyperion and it was absolutely fantastic, can't wait for more."
68502,I’m currently on Endymion and wanted to advocate for not stopping after Fall of Hyperion. Different characters but very much a continuation of the same larger storyline.
68503,The de Soya character arc is one of my favorites in all scifi
68504,"Some of the characters are really cool! Ah, but the protagonist, I don't like how things played out. Just my opinion"
68505,"Check out the audio book for Dune. It's pretty good I think.

Edit: I'm being downvoted. Well, just wow. Dune is awesome and it has various actors, I think it's pretty darn good."
68506,I agree with you.   How do you feel about Endymion?  Most Dan Simmons I've read outside of Hyperion has had some kind of element that let me down.   Hyperion was perfection.
68507,"I actually preferred *Fall of Hyperion* the best, but it's really a continuation of *Hyperion*, so I treat the two books as essentially one.

The two *Endymion* books were fine--not as good as their predecessors, but fine books in and of themselves.  I've read many other books by Simmons--*Illium* and *Olympos*, *Drood*, *The Hollow Man*, etc....  Most were interesting/good.  I how no issues with Simmons' writing, other than perhaps the tendency to overreach his plotlines, which can lead to somewhat disappointing ending--I'm thinking specifically of the ""battle of the Gods"" implied at the end of *Olympos*.  But perhaps I was expecting too much--how can a mere human write a convincing battle of Gods."
68508,The ending of Hyperion is perfection?
68509,I'm referring to both books...Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion together.  The first book on its own would just be confusing.
68510,Wow back to back comments I agree with 100%. Now if only we can get a Heinlein hate train going...
68511,Wait. Did I miss something? Do we have Heinlein now?
68512,"I found Stranger in a Strange land initially
Interesting but then it seemed to descend into some sort of weird sex cult fantasy and I hated it by the time I was done. It’s like it forgot what it was talking about and just started wanking itself off mid chapter."
68513,thats a bold move cotton.
68514,ha i always go into these threads to make sure the rightful ruler is in place
68515,Recently started this series. I'm on God Emperor of Dune right now. Quickly becoming one of my favorite series
68516,Glory to the God Emperor! Enjoy :)
68517,I thought the Foundation trilogy was awful only because the resolution was anti-climatic
68518,"Don't put it away yet.  I've tried several times to get into it and have never made it more than 200 or so pages.  To be fair, I listen to nothing but sci fi audiobooks at work and Dune requires more concentration than most books, so it's probably something I'll have to actually read.  Next time I binge a book on vacation I'll reassess my views because in theory it's right up my alley and I liked the movie
even as a kid."
68519,"My absolute favorite book is God Emperor of Dune, the 4th book in the Dune series. It is one of those books that you either love or hate because its so different stylistically from other books. Its a lot more monologue than action, but what that means is you NEED to pay attention. I felt like if I stopped listening for a few minutes I would be completely lost. Dune is similar in that regard. Everything matters.  I have books I like that are less cerebral, but sometimes I just wanna immerse myself in the awesome and cruel world of Arrakis. To me, Dune is so exceptional because its not just a book but a full on experience."
68520,"Yea, once I get started I'm sure I'll binge the entire series. I can read 4-6x faster than listening to audio books and my attention isn't consistent listening to it, so I miss to much. I haven't been reading much fiction lately so I'll definitely make that a priority. Getting through the series in audio-books would take way to long."
68521,"I’m in the hate camp. Read the first three and liked then all but incrementally less and less each time. But God Emperor is the one that made me stop reading entirely. Didn’t finish it, didn’t care to read anything after it. I just hated it so much!"
68522,"I think it over-emphasizes classics a little too much, which is expected for user-voted list but may not really be accurate for ""100 best books"" type of lists."
68524,"I tend to like those rankings better, although I still disagree with several of them."
68525,"I completely agree, but I prefer classics so I love that list."
68526,"Yep that Top 5 is so dead on for me.

Actually the only one in the top 15 that I don't think belongs is Starship Troopers. The movie is fantastic, I didn't enjoy the book at all. I'd probably replace it with Liu Cixin's The Dark Forest or Iain Bank's Use of Weapons. Atleast Use of Weapons is on there though, that book is a masterpiece."
68527,"I agree. r/fantasy has an all-time and ""top books read in 2018"" list. I'm looking for the latter but for sci-fi."
68528,"Looking at the list, it feels so incredible at how old most of the entries are. I think the highest ranked one is *The Forever War* at #17. 

Compare that to fantasy, where I feel like there are so many excellent books still coming out. Hard to draw the conclusion that SF is not in a rut."
68529,"So many great books have appeared recently. The Expanse, bobbiverse, culture series, the martian, ready player one, wool omnibus, just to name a few of the more popular ones."
68530,If I was to name a great scifi from recently I'd say Ancilliary Justice.
68531,"Yes, Wool! Fantastic books"
68532,"The Expanse is fun and the show is fantastic but ""great"" for a list like that? What next, The Hunger Ga... oh wait that one is in the list. Ok then The Expanse belongs. :)"
68533,"Dude,  i read the Hunger Games.  I assure you that, if nothing more,  they're *addictive*."
68534,"I don't understand that sentiment. I loved the first book, but I had to force myself through book 3 after a very mediocre book 2. Katniss spends a large part of the books either in a medical or psychological hallucination while the action happens 'off-screen' and the motivations of the characters often appear tacked-on(but the whole premise is so artificial it's hard to emphasize anyway). I vastly prefer the movies, they are at least over quicker."
68535,"I never read them but I saw the first film and my issue with it is the entire premise. How does forcing the districts to murder their own children ‘keep them compliant’?

Or did I misunderstand? I watched that movie on a plane, but it seemed like this battle Royale happened regardless of their actions."
68536,Personally I consider The Expanse one of the future classics of the genre and some of the best books I've ever read.
68537,"I don't think the writing is strong enough for it to qualify for something like that (but then again, people handed The Wheel of Time awards for no real reason). 

I *do* think the show will wind up somewhere between BSG and Farscape, however. The acting in the show at times is a little like the writing, but it's strengthened by some strong moments (spinning the drum, the riot on Eros, the full turn in the first episode, some others in season 3 I wouldn't want to spoil here)."
68538,">don't think the writing is strong enough for it to qualify for something like that (but then again, people handed The Wheel of Time awards

Foundation has shitty writing and it makes this kind of lists often. It's an awesome story and sets a lot of modern sci-fi tropes but it's not known for its prose."
68539,"The reason Foundation makes those lists is because it offered something really *new* and to an extent created an entire subgenre. In the 40s and 50s when it was written, there really wasn't anything like it, at least in terms of dealing with a long-term drawn-out conflict within a galactic empire. 

The Expanse doesn't offer anything particularly new in that sense (that's not to say the book series/show doesn't entertain). Localized space conquest and exploration isn't all that uncommon. Conflicts between a colonized solar system (Earth/Mars) show up all over the place in works as well knows as KSR's Mars Trilogy. A conflict that starts somewhat similar to the Expanse- in the sense of Earth/Mars followed by (admittedly different) large scale exploration can also be seen in works far more obscure, like Hegemonia (a fun older videogame) or Freelancer. 

That's pretty much why Foundation and a few other classic novels hit the list. You probably couldn't have the newer novels without their influence."
68540,"I'd like to put forward that The Expanse is the first book that provides a look at the long term effects of living in space without FTL and artificial gravity. It's hard science fiction(aside from the obvious impossibility of the drive they use) in a sense no book of that scale has been before. 

And I'm sorry but I have to disagree about the writing. It's written better than Dune(especially the later books), Neuromancer or any of the other classics that most people would never read because they couldn't get into the books for more than a few pages because the subject matter is hidden behind a need to complicate everything. The writing is one of it's absolute strong points, I don't understand why you disparage it."
68541,The acting in the show is down right awful haha come on....
68542,"Right, which is why I compared it to the book's writing and said the show is propped up by other things."
68543,"I didn't read the book, so I did not know the writing was awful. Your comment reads that the acting is strengthened by other elements. From your reply I see that what you meant to say is that the show is strengthened by other elements."
68544,I agree completely! The list above was probably compiled 10 years ago (the newest book is from 2008).
68545,"I'm not sure how I feel about this list. Half of the series you mentioned aren't on the list, include The Expanse and Bobbiverse which are pretty well known."
68546,there is a ton of fantastic sci fi coming out. Really great stuff.
68547,"It just takes time for the best books to be shared around and find their place on the list. There is another list on that site of the next 100 best books and there are more modern ones there. 

Really hard to say we are in a rut of some kind. Personally I doubt it, but I’ll tell you for sure in about 40 years when the dust settles."
68548,"The problem with user voted lists is that you get huge biases. People vote for what they've read, and what they've read are the classics."
68549,"I am not sure if it is a rut, or if the genre splintered so much that tastes and fandoms have split up as well.  For example there are a bunch of books for singularity, cyborgs, space travel, far future, time travel, etc.  People have split up in those areas.

There is also the fact that sci-fi TV shows and movies have sucked up a lot of that fandom as well.  After you've seen Stargate, any book about a similar plot will get compared to it as well.  Considering the number of Stargate episodes and the richness being added to them by the actors themselves, it is entirely too easy to compare the book to your favorite episodes, resulting in a lower score.  That's excluding the books written in the world of that TV show, potentially resulting in a somewhat derivative work.

Not to mention that people have a limited amount of free time and attention span.  If you spend so much of it on the sci-fi on TV, Netflix, Amazon, and movies, then less attention and time is spent on equivalent books.

These things are not so when talking about the fantasy genre - compared to sci-fi, there is very little live-action fantasy.  Besides GoT I can't think of any high production fantasy show on right now."
68550,"I think you’ve just inadvertently given me the reason why I don’t think I like sci fi as much as fantasy. 

I have trouble reading books that are older. Of the language is ever slightly dated I just find it hard to engage. Whenever I try to read many of the books on this list inevitably put them down. I have realised that I just don’t hear that much about newer books. I recently read Adrian Tchaikovsky’s children of time and I fucking loved it."
68551,"Huh, weird.  I did not like most of the ones at the top.  My first pick for ""best book"" is at #30.  Maybe #17.  Tastes vary."
68552,"I read nearly all of the top 200, except the stupid ones like ready player one (I refuse to read that). I have many disagreements with the order, but popularity and accessibility factor into statistical lists quite a bit. It really can’t be helped."
68553,I haven't seen a Geocities site since 1997
68554,"I wish lists like this were broken down by era - classics, modern, new - to allow for more movement in the upper slots (getting away from Asimov, Bradbury, etc.)."
68555,No Iain M Banks? Not a sci fi list.
68556,Number 63 and 71.
68557,"Few quibbles with this list. 

But I would say, that ""Ringworld"" as #1 in a series is misleading. Several short stories and a few Known Space novels preceeded it. When I read ""Ringworld"" after reading those, it was a culmination of the stories, and completely blew me away."
68558,"Interesting to see Julian-May on there. I enjoyed reading TMCL but it never really felt bestof material, felt pretty self-indulgent and a bit pulpy to me. Unless of course it's a historically important novel, but it's from 1989 so I can't see any of the ideas in it being new at that time..."
68559,"A lot more Heinlen there than I expected.  

Also seems to be a fair concentration on Golden Age works.  Little love for newer notable novels like Ancillary Justice or Clockwork Girl."
68560,"I just don't understand what everyone loves about Stranger in a Strange Land. It was fine, not the 5th best at all though."
68561,"Its top 100 for me, but i liked several of his more. heinlein was an amazing writer."
68562,"I didn’t like that book very much either. But it did give us the word grok, so that’s something."
68563,"Hell, I wouldn't even put it in Heinlein's top five, much less the overall top five."
68564,"It's a pretty terrible list looking over it..

""The Road"" sticks out especially.."
68565,"I mean they have Battlefield Earth on there at #53, that should set of some warning bells."
68566,"It won a Pulitzer Prize. I thought it was well written, albeit very sad."
68567,"It's a great book, just not one I would put on a list of science fiction reads.."
68568,"Yeah lots of people wouldn’t call it sci fi, but I would. It takes place in a near-future dystopia, which gets it in the club. 

I enjoyed guessing what the event was that caused all that destruction."
68569,It's one the greatest books of the 21st century.
68570,"That is a garbage list. Those novels are old, boring, and super outdated in today's world. 

And seriously, who younger than 50 years old actually reads books that old?"
68571,"How can you say they’re boring or speak to the relevancy of their content if you haven’t even read them? 

I’ve read all of them and I’m nowhere near 50. If you told me a few books you’ve enjoyed I could probably pick one off that list that would blow you away."
68572,"I've attempted to read every one of them. Forever War was the one I read the most pages of. It was interesting at first then got boring.

Basically any book pre-1990 I don't like the style of."
68573,"Wow, talk about being proud of being ignorant."
68574,you bring shame upon us all scifi_jon.  You know what [you must do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku).  Be swift.
68575,"I do and most of them I've read are awesome.... not always from the style of writing, but those ideas people had back in those days are great. Sure some could be seen as silly nowadays, but others are normal modern day technology today. But thats a thing with classics, you might need some time and they are hardly an easy read."
68576,And yet the Bible is still amazingly popular.
68577,">...and super outdated in today's world. 

lol, yeah books that were written about *the far future* are ""outdated"".

Sure."
68578,"Seconding this question. I'd love to see an ""essentials"" infographic with categories like space opera, cyberpunk, military sci-fi, shit like that.

4chan is a god awful place, but the ""essentials"" charts on /mu/ have pointed me toward a lot of great music."
68579,Got a link to those music charts?
68580,"Why is sci-fi obsessed with ""essentials""? Why can't you just read books in the sci-fi genre without having someone try to force a bunch of old books down your throat?"
68581,"It's not always old books; that's your prejudice shining through. 

Me, personally, I would immediately recommend *Blindsight* by Peter Watts, which was published in 2006. Neal Stephenson would be up there. Nancy Kress. I'm a little pissed off by your attitude or I could think of others. Good SciFi transcends the ages, but the best SciFi, the essential stuff, isn't always old."
68582,"I think the issue is that there are those books that break your mind _right now_ (like Blindsight), and there are those that broke some older people's, and now their toolkit/theme is part of the genre, and widely known. Asimov is a great example of SF that was revolutionary at his time, some amount of scientific approach to problems was unheard of. But these days it's not a new thing anymore. Some books are only valuable for their historic context."
68583,"Blindsight is amazing. My favorite sci-fi book, the one I think is better than any I've read, is Dark Intelligence. But there is no ""essential"" sci-fi. There's just books you like reading. 

Like, I think Dune is absolute garbage. I really do believe it's a poorly written book with a stupid story. But for some reason, by stating that, I have now pissed off a ridiculous number of sci-fi lovers who claim I must read and enjoy certain essentials or there is no point in reading sci-fi. 

There are no essential books to read. Shit, classics or so-called ""essentials"" are classics/essentials because of lack of competition at the time. Not because they have better stories or are better written than books published recently"
68584,"I only read Echopraxia and thought it was utter garbage and liked Dune very much... Scifi is all about taste. First which genre, next which setting.... but in those categories there are some essentials imho (those who helped define or bring the subgenre forward) and you will somewhen stumble on to them and most likely read them. Who cares if someone else thinks bad about it, that doesn't matter, but some will be classics/essentials.

They are also not classic/essentials because of lack of competition, but because of going new ways (or old ways in a new fashion). It would mean, that there are only about 200 great scifi books, since they are the only ones in those lists. No... the others were not good enough or have been long forgotten. Scifi always had the cliche of being a trash genre and at the core this is not so wrong... there is a lot of shit printed and titled Scifi out there and has been in the past.

&#x200B;"
68585,"It's fine mate, we can tell you have very incredibly poor taste. 

To each their own. 

Stick with YA Fiction you’ll find it easier.

> Shit, classics or so-called ""essentials"" are classics/essentials because of lack of competition at the time

Ever heard of the Golden age of Sci-fi? When *every* literary magazine in the US was publishing sci-fi because it was so popular? 

Dune was published at a time when competition in the field *was extremely high* just like many other seminal sci-fi novels."

68595,The bobiverse is what got me hooked onto scifi. Loved the idea and attention to detail. Great as an audio book as well.
68596,"I don't see ""The Mote in God's Eye"" called out - excellent world-building and story telling."
68597,I couldn't finish this one though. The prejudicial nature of the book (and I've heard of the author himself as well) towards the end was just way too thick. It started VERY well though.
68598,"Anything Warhammer 40k by by Dan Abnet. The books are master pieces.

Start with the Eisenhorn omnibus if you are not familiar with the universe."
68599,"Years ago I stumbled upon a pack of ""100 greatest sci-fi novels"" audiobooks. While I don't think the ranking itself means much, nevertheless they are some fantastic books that have profoundly changed my worldview. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Here are some of my favorites in no particular order:

1. Hyperion - Dan Simmons 
This book is way underrated. Told in frame structure about a group of pilgrims travelling to a mysterious planet called Hyperion to meet a creature called the Shrike, the story of each pilgrim is unique and beautiful and impacts me to this day. Cannot recommend enough.
2. I, robot - Isaac Asimov
A history of robotics told through charming short stories. Many really challenge your morals and values as it asks very critical questions - for instance, should a robot hold political power, if they are programmed to do the best for humanity? Amazing, thought provoking book. Nothing like the movie.
3. The Martian Chronicles-Ray Bradbury
This one I also don't see talked about too much, but it's one of my favorites. Again, a series of short stories detailing humanity's discovery of mars and martians. Very unique thoughts behind this one - for instance, what if we finally meet martians, but they don't believe we are aliens? Fascinating read.
4. Rendezvous with Rama - Arthur C Clarke
Classic Clarke hard fiction, a crew investigates a mysterious object flying towards earth. Good old adventure, unraveling the world bit by bit. Definitely takes you to another world and is hard to put down.
5. Enders Game
This was the first book in the pack and started me off on this whole sci fi adventure. This is fairly well known so I won't talk about it too much, but God its an amazing story with amazing characters. The sequal, Speaker for the dead, is very different but amazing as well. Both would recommend."
68601,"its probably been 15 years since I read them, I should go back and see if its like new again."
68602,"Some more love for Hyperion here. That story is very engaging and very well put, and it's such an awesome exploration of many of the Sci-Fi genres as well! I especially recommend it to anyone looking to discover what Sci-Fi is about. 

One day, I'll forget enough about it. One day..."
68603,"I've read a few series by Arthur C Clarke and in retrospect I disliked all of them. Just to be clear, I loved the concepts that he came up with. Really fascinating stuff. It's just that *it takes so friggin long for anything to happen*. The books feel like they're great concepts that have been stretched to the breaking point and then stuffed with filler material."
68604,His short stories are pretty good though.
68605,"I've only read rendezvous, childhoods end and 2001, and really enjoyed all of them. While they may be a bit slow I never find them boring, and rendezvous is probably one of the faster paced ones, jumping into action pretty quickly!"
68606,"All the awards http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books.asp
 
A lot of lists from around the web - https://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists.asp"
68607,This is a much easier way to find the Hugo (etc) winners each year...
68608,I wish people would see that Scifi exist in other language too... As far as I can see there is no non english award there.
68609,I know those guys were looking for such awards or lists. Unfortunately looks like language barrier didn’t allow it. They have a bunch of translated non-english SF books on the site though - https://www.worldswithoutend.com/rollyourown.asp?ryo_id=293. If you know of a consistently updated non-english list you should reach out to them - https://www.worldswithoutend.com/mbbs22/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=1724&posts=525&start=1.
68610,"My personal top 8 (not ranked in order of preference):

* Hyperion/The Fall of Hyperion - Dan Simmons
* Dune - Frank Herbert
* 2001: A Space Odyssey - Arthur C. Clarke
* A Canticle for Leibowitz - Walter M. Miller
* The City and the Stars - Arthur C. Clarke
* Roadside Picnic - Arkady and Boris Strugatsky
* The Cyberiad - Stanislaw Lem
* Contact - Carl Sagan"
68611,"Finally! Someone mentioned Lem!
I can recommend The Futurological Congress by him. My favourite sci-fi book."
68612,"That book is an amazing little gem! However, it had weird effects in my psyche and at least one other friend back when we read it in our teens.  I don't know what it does and how it does it, but we both had very vivid dreams and a constant sense of dread for days after reading it."
68613,"Yup, I can relate. It just make you rethink everything you experience. And every word has its own sense. This book requires all of your attention. No disturbance.
I had the pleasure of talking to Lem personally and this is something I will never forget. He made me think differently about every aspect of my existence. It seems cliché when I say it but I truly believe in it."
68614,"I am lucky enough to be able to read Lem in his native language so I have read a lot of his books. I would put several more of his on the above list, but I am not sure if they've been translated into English or the quality of the translations."
68615,"Same here, I've read them in Polish. Translations are not that bad, but as you probably know, Polish is more expressive than English. It loses much of its original diversity after translating."
68616,">A Canticle for Leibowitz - Walter M. Miller

My man"
68617,"Considering that I like the list, what would be 4 best books publised since 1990?"
68618,"You could try:

The Stars are Legion - Kameron Hurley

Ilium - Dan Simmons

Old Man's War - John Scalzi

The Road - Cormac McCarthy

It's not easy to find good new Sci-Fi...

&#x200B;"
68619,"Good list.  Very similar to my own,  if i were to make one.   I'd put The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch somewhere on there but add that it's not for everybody...but if you like *weird* it's critical that you read it."
68620,"Coyote by Allen Steele is AMAZING and hands-down my favorite sci-fi novel. Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1984, Brave New World are all essentials. And if you can stand some gore/psycho thriller aspects, The Sparrow by Mary Doris Russell."
68621,S.N.U.F.F. by Viktor Pelevin. It's like a combination of '1984' and maybe Elysium but with a Russian twist and a seriously poignant social critique. Awesome book
68622,SF Signal made a [flowchart](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/flowchart_for_navigating_nprs_top_100_sff_books/) of NPR’s top 100 sci-fi and fantasy books. Just be aware some of them are strictly fantasy.
68623,Can we start a list? I nominate peter Hamilton’s commonwealth sage
68624,"Same,  always my go to on these threads,  it's enough to last you a few years unless you never stop reading lol."
68625,"I'm reading Pandora's star. I'm about a third way into it.  I simply don't care about what is going on. I'm thinking about stopping.  If I didn't like the first third, do you think the remaining of the book would change my mind?"
68626,"Oh heck. I dunno man lol I hate to tell you to keep going and you don’t dig it. Of course I wanna tell you to keep going but if you’re not interested by now I don’t if it’ll jump
Out and pinch you. I got hooked when they had the mars landing at the beginning. I’m scared to say much more cause I don’t wanna give anything away. Good luck lol. I understand though, if I story doesn’t grab me before I get too deep I’ll drop it."
68627,Huh. I got through the first two volumes of The Reality Dysfunction series and lost interest due to fragmented plot and an onslaught of woo-woo. I take it this one follows through?
68628,"Pandoras star and Judas unchained were the ones I was thinking of but I could have the name wrong on the series, I thought it was the commonwealth saga. I guess two
Books aren’t really a saga though lol"
68629,"The Commonwealth Saga is either the two you mentioned or the set of about 10 books in the same universe. They're all pretty good, with Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained probably being the best two"
68630,"Coolio, I enjoyed the shit out of PS and JU, read them
Both a few times. I haven’t touched the others though. I may be missing out."
68631,"Actually, this question comes up pretty often so it's quite easy to find a lot of aggregated suggestions. A few months ago I picked up 4-5 of those threads and wrote down the titles that came up more often. Just search for ""suggestions"" or something like that.

It might take longer and be less practical than the r/fantasy list, but it could give you a bit more insight about what people like about those books."
68632,"Orbit has a masterworks of SF and fantasy series. You might find their list enjoyable. The Hugo, nebula and Clarke annual awards are also available as a list, I recommend all of them. If that isn't enough - Gardner dozois produces the years best series which is produced as a monster book of short stories - these are often the first chapter of the authors upcoming book. A great way to discover new SF authors. I sure miss Amazon's user picks, can't even remember what it was called"
68633,/r/printsf has one
68634,Player of Games by Iain M Banks is a must.
68635,I think it’s The Player of Games*. But yes love this book
68636,I think it's time to create one.
68637,"Might be on the linked lists... but I love Neal Stephenson.

Some of his books are on the longer side, but worth the payoff. 

I’ve read anathem and snowcrash so far."
68638,"If you pretend the third act doesn’t exist, Seveneyes is great book"
68639,"Alas, exactly right."
68640,Completely agree. Seveneves was two-thirds of a great book.
68641,"One of my favorite authors. It’s not Sci-Fi, but the Baroque Cycle was a work of art. The sort of sequel Cryptonomicon is also great. Could call that one “Cyber-science” fiction."
68642,"Snow Crash and The Diamond Age are my favorites of his.

I haven't enjoyed his more recent stuff as much.  I've still read it though!"
68643,"Anathem was tough through the first hundred pages but I loved it after that. Planning on reading his other stuff, hoping I haven’t already read his best entries."
68644,man i know several people who gave up. I tried to tell them about the second half of the book and no one believes me!
68645,"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/11/139085843/your-picks-top-100-science-fiction-fantasy-books

This is the list I refer to when I looking for new books to read for both SciFi and fantasy, a bit old so it won't have those published in the last 8 years."
68646,Solaris #34? :/
68647,"Sad to see the Black Ocean: Mobius series by J. S. Morin isn't anywhere on these lists! (not that I've seen yet anyways). Awesome firefly-esk feel, with wizards, and an amazingly deep universe. There's 2 spinoff series (Mercy for hire; Astral prime) based off the original that really delve into the universe and its characters. Highly recommend it to anyone"
68648,This is my go-to site.  http://scifilists.sffjazz.com/
68649,Dune is always the answer
68650,"Anything by Arthur C Clarke, specifically Childhoods End and the Rama books."
68651,"My personal favorites, for whatever that's worth: 

Isaac Asimon - The Foundation Trilogy, the Robot Novels

Frank Herbert - Dune series

Douglas Adams - Hitchhikers Guide

Larry Niven - Ringworld series

James S A Corey - The Expanse"
68652,the best of the best...  http://www.thehugoawards.org/
68653,"That's cool how they are doing retroactive rewards for 1944 at the same time as 2019. I was just thinking Hugo awards are great only for newer books, but I was wrong."
68654,"yeah, they are retro as fuck"
68655,"Try [this.](https://i.imgur.com/6S38gEd.jpg)

It's more of an intro to SciFi, if you like X theme, try Y.  And sure it's missing a few of my favorites like Neuromancer and Hyperion... but it's a pretty solid little guide."

68657,"Altered Carbon, Snow Crash, Expanse Series, The Martian and Old Man's War cover a few different areas of the genre, which will help you figure out which (if any) sub genre you prefer.  Those were a couple that stood out in my mind and are generally well received.  Looking at top 100 lists can be kinda overwhelming, so I kept it simple.  Snow Crash is probably the most hit or miss and The Expanse books probably the easiest to enjoy (think action movie in space."
68658,"If you’re looking for space or alien based movies then 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien series, Contact, Arrival, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind"
