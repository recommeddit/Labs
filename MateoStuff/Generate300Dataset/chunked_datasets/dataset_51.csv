16347,Rayban aviators. But the shape of your face determines what glasses suit you best!
16348,Oakley TwoFaced prescription polarized sunglasses. My fourth year now. Lot cheaper without prescription.
16349,And for when I have contact lens I have Oakley inmate. It's metal and I originally had the inmates. It was really refreshing to have a plastic lightweight twoface.
16350,Persol 714
16352,Honestly it's ironic half the stuff getting upvoted around here is owned by Luxottica brands anyways.
16353,"I'm a reasonably serious sunglass/eyeglass collector, so I'd say I know something about sunglasses. 

There is nothing wrong with most Luxottica brands, and quality and finishing ranges tremendously within the conglomerate. I wouldn't hesitate to buy Persols, Pradas or Oakleys as everyday sunglass if they suit your style. People like to join in the anti-Luxottica circlejerk and group these brands together because they are uninformed and think that quality sunglasses would suddenly become available at gas station prices if Luxottica didn't exist. They wouldn't, and the numerous independent sunglass manufacturers out there that charge similar or greater prices for their sunglasses is evidence of that."
16354,"The problem is that, with Ray Ban for example, they *literally were gas station sunglasses* before Luxottica bought them. Then Luxottica both raised the price and dropped the quality when they acquired the brand (changing the 5-barrel hinge for 3 barrel, for example). Similar deal with Oakley, the quality dropped significantly following acquisition by Luxoticca. 

Independent sunglass manufacturers that charge similar or greater prices are generally much better quality in terms of construction and materials than Luxoticca.

I find it much more silly when people think they're rebelling against Luxoticca by going to Warby Parker/Spec Savers etc. which tend to be even worse."
16356,Why is Warby Parker just as bad as Luxottica?
16357,"Because Prada, Ray Ban, Tiffany, etc they are all owned by a monopolistic firm that pushes prices up 500%. Your sunglasses are probably worth about $40."
16358,Same as with any brand stuff. I think most of the hate for luxottica comes from them not being an american company.
16359,"Like with most stuff

But Ice owned two pairs of Ray Bans in my life/still own them

I dropped them countless times on any surface and sat on them once or twice and they always came out unscathed 

It could be pure luck but I got my moneys worth"
16360,"Pushed up 500% from what? Wholesale to retail? Vs comparable brands? Vs the cost materials and labor? 

I pay $100 for wayfarers, I'd love to see the comparable $20 sunglasses you're talking about 

I buy knockarounds brand for about $20 but the clarity of the lens sucks and they scratch easily, unlike luxotica brands"
16361,"I love my clubmasters but holy God does every man and his dog wear them now. 

I swear I started wearing them before they became cool."
16362,Spoken like a true hipster
16363,Oh you know it pal ;)
16364,Zenni Optical is my go to since the beginning of the year.
16365,That's like two months.
16366,Ray-Ban Polarized Aviators are great. Tom Fords are even better but pricier.
16367,My favourite are my Dior Homme Composit 1.0s
16368,Love [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJQG13O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) cheap and easy glasses from Amazon.
16369,Pricey but cutler and gross.
16370,"I stick to my Natives for everyday use. A cheap pair of Nectars goes a long way too, for doing things or going places I think I might lose my nicer sunglasses."
16371,BluBlockers!
16372,"Person 649's in Havana or black. Any color way really. They have crystal lenses and it really is a different visual experience. 

https://bonocle.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/smq2.jpg?w=509&h=729


BluBlocker Havana aviators. I grew up on blue blocker commercials and I would get them in dollar stores for $19.99. Cue to a movie called the Hangover and now they are a luxury eyewear brand. Either way the blue spectrum blocking makes these great glasses to wear outside or even indoors.

16373,Ray Ban new style Wayfarers
16374,"Whatever you get, make sure to get polarized lenses."
16375,"http://www.zennioptical.com/

I would recommend checking out this website. You can get some pretty good looking prescription glasses/sunglasses customizable to your needs for VERY CHEAP. If you want to invest $200 into raybands, go ahead, this isnt the site for you. But if you want to spend $20-$40 on a pair, try it"
16376,[Oliver People NDG-1](http://i47.tinypic.com/2wh33ti.jpg) are my go to sunglasses.
16377,I recently got Ray Ban CATS 5000 Classic and I love them.
16378,i.c. berlin
16379,"The air force museum sells the actual aviator sunglasses for a reasonable price(~$80). If you are gonna get aviators, why not go with the real deal. 

http://store.airforcemuseum.com/apparel/sunglasses/ao-eyewear-original-pilot-sunglasses-silver-30120.html"
16380,I have the rayban New wayfarers for everyday and the club masters for a slightly more formal/upscale look
16381,"For fashion, I'm not sure why anyone needs more than aviators, wayfarers, or club masters. I think these 3 will stand the test of time and between the 3, you can fit with any outfit and/or occasion. Whichever brand you get it from, it doesn't really matter. I have gone through various brands through out the years, and while this may generate 50/50 support/hate, I 100% believe Ray Bans be superior to everything else. I have gotten stuff from others like RE, but at the same price points, I just still believe RBs to be much better quality. I've flat out stepped on mine by accident and could never tell. They also seemed to be much more scratch resistant. For some cheaper alternatives, I've gotten Sunclouds which were ok for the price. I wouldn't have bought them with my own money though as I bought them with LL bean gift cards (the LL bean warranty at the time made them too hard to resist, though that may now be questionable)."
16382,"Pepper's Sunglasses. One of the few glasses that aren't owned by Luxotica. They are from Pennsylvania. Only $45 each and can be replaced in any condition for $20

I  like the Sunset Boulevard style, with the blue lenses. I am mad they discontinued the blue frames, but had to settle for the grey frames with blue lenses. I am a big fan of the brand, the only problem is this style doesn't float, but other styles do.

Seriously, don't give you money to luxotica.

That includes Rayban"
16383,I'm a fan of the Ray-Ban 3386 modified aviators. They look great with everything in my opinion.
16384,Rayban Clubmasters are my only pair and I love them
16385,[Ray Ban **Squared** Clubmasters](http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/RB4190%20MALE%20010-clubmaster%20square-tortoise/713132586471)
16386,I just bought another pair of [Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses/sunglasses-keyhole.html) sunglasses in Tortoiseshell. I owned a pair of them last summer and they were my most favorite pair of sunglasses but unfortunately I lost them in a river.
16387,Shocked nobody else has mentioned these. I love mine.
16388,"Selima Optique - Chad.

Lasted me 5 years almost now, look great."
16389,"[Ray-Ban Navigator.](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/ray-ban-59mm-navigator-sunglasses/3298703) It's a squared-off aviator similar to American Optical or Randolph Engineering, but the fit works way better for me. (I previously owned a pair of AOs and they were constantly sliding down my face. These stay put.)"
16390,"None, waste of money. Sun never shines here."

16392,These [Camo sunglasses](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-camo-oakleys-for-cheap.html) are favorite. I am happy with these amazing sunglasses and I am also a big fan of [sports](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-oakley-sport-sunglasses.html) and [polarized](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-oakleys-polarized-sunglasses.html) sunglasses.

16394,Aint nothing wrong with the cheapie knock offs. Great for work!
16395,"Have you considered Persols? They're high quality with great designs, but slightly under the radar compared to RayBan.

16396,Chinese knock off ken block things. Avoid the white frames and blue tint and you wont be that wanker tradie.
16397,"I have a pair of Oakley frogskins I really like. The plastic they use is really nice. It's light, and incredibly solid (you can bend the wings back 180 degrees without them breaking). That plus the hinge design makes them pretty much unbreakable. I know that Oakley is a contentious brand, but I think that model at least manages to to avoid the typical chunky Oakley style."
16398,"These are only $10 off Amazon and I get lots of people asking where I got them

16401,"1) Maui Jim 
2) Ray Ban
3) Randolph Engineering 

Honorable Mention: American Optical"
16402,You don't think Ray Ban is a little overrated?  I think Randolph has much better build quality
16403,"They get way too much shit just because they're owned by Luxottica. At the end of the day all the og styles originated with them (Aviators, Wayfarers, and Clubmasters). That said I would never pay full retail price for them. The pairs I do own have all held up way better than the pairs of Randolphs I own despite their supposed better build quality."
16404,"It’s not so much the quality decrease as the market position. They already had the history. In the old days, there weren’t many options and there were literally what you could get at the store. Probably a big reason their styles are so accepted. Now Lux has taken that historical grounding and boosted it exponentially with sheer marketing prowess. So for 90% of people, it is a comfortable choice, and just what they think of when they’re sunglass shopping. I’ve seen it happen at the shops. Nearly every casual user walks straight to the Ray Bans, not even stopping to check the Maui Jim’s or Vuarnets or more obscure options."
16405,"Haha, that‘s an understatement. Not bad but certainly not better (usually worse) than about 10 similarly priced brands I can think of. I can respect the vintage collectors, but the people who‘s answer to every question is “Ray Ban” are drunk on Luxottica Cool Aid."
16406,I think Oakley has taken biggest fall under luxotica umbrella. Although I do not think RB is up to their game considering how much those cost

16480,"I've worked for an eye doctor for almost seven years and sunglasses are my jam! Maui Jim is known for having amazing lens clarity. Stylistically, there's not a huge difference between Ray-Ban and Maui Jim frames. You really can't go wrong with a classic wayfarer or aviator. The trend is definitely moving toward rounder styles, I would imagine that will be in for a while. I wouldn't recommend Oakley in this case, they tend to be very sporty/trendy and look dated sooner than other brands. No matter what you go with, I would suggest trying them on and buying them in a brick and mortar store so you get a great fitting pair and can go back for adjustments. Hold onto your receipts because they usually come with a warranty!"
16481,"Seconding this rec for maui jims. Their lenses are awesome, with amazing clarity. I don't think I can go back to regular lenses after using polarized lenses for driving , etc. They are pricey, but it's worth every penny! I haven't worn any of my other sunglasses since. 

I also had a fantastic experience with their warranty, which is 2 years according to their policy. After owning my pair of maverick (aviator style) for bout 1.5 years, I noticed the coating on the inside of the lens coming off. This is the part that rubs against my cheek...And I have oily skin...so who knows. Anyway, I call their warranty and repair centre and they said no problem, just send it in. No proof of purchase, no receipts required. I had to pay shipping, which was fine. 

(Btw, for Canadians, their repair centre is located in Mississauga!)

About 2 weeks later, a new pair of the exact sunglasses showed up at my door! Their note said they didn't have the parts on hand to repair my defective pair, so they just sent me a new pair. :D Minor issue of having to go back to my optician to adjust the glasses to my face..but I still got a new pair in the end. My optician said companies like Ray ban wouldn't cover coating issues, let alone have a 2 year warranty. 

I've noticed their styles are getting more with the times - more stylish, more female targeted choices. Their older pairs are sportier than my preference. I have my eye on a pair of keanae and that's my next pair of mj's."
16482,"> I don't think I can go back to regular lenses after using polarized lenses for driving

What is the color of the lens that you wear for driving (grey, bronze, rose, or green)? Have you tried wearing the glasses in rain or even at night? Just curious because many of the newer LED headlights sort of blind me and I'm not trying to look that hard at them."
16484,"Thanks! I think part of the problem is that I ride/drive a car and most of the vehicles where I live (in Texas) are these super big trucks and SUVs. Most of the people legit have their brights (or high beams) on when driving around town and because I am in a car, the headlights are all at eye level. So thanks for sharing. I had never heard of some of these lens coatings."
16485,"My pair is the grey lenses. It only turned out that way because I liked that specific frame colour and grey lenses was what it came with :p I think it's meant for sunnier conditions so it's too dark if I wear them in the evening or when it's rainy. Although I can still wear them when it's overcast but still ""bright""... If you know what I mean..."
16486,"I was just browsing the Maui Jim website and wondered if you had a preference for the lens color (grey, bronze, rose, or green)?"
16487,"From a style perspective, I like the grey lenses (unless you went with a brown frame in which case the bronze looks better IMO). There's also a new blue mirror lens that's pretty cool looking! If you're looking to wear them in cloudy conditions you might be better off with the green, though. I'm not sure if you generally wear clear prescription glasses, but I would definitely suggest a good anti-glare to help with the headlight glare at night!"
16488,"Ok, thanks! My last vision check was 3 years ago and I had 20/20 vision. I don't know if it is just because I have blue eyes, but I always feel like I am blinded by the sun and the headlights. I just have some cheap polarized Foster Grant glasses from Walgreens, but wondered if there was a better option."
16489,"I've had official Maui Jim training in the past, and the lens color boils down to what your primary use for them will be.  Each color is for different conditions. I also think for this brand in particular the lens material and the gradient you choose is pretty important as well."
16490,"Ok, thanks! It's amazing the different technology they have. I have some $20 cheap polarized glasses from Walgreens. My husband has some yellow polarized sunglasses he bought from Academy. I can tell a difference with his lenses and with mine, but I didn't know about the rose or green colored lenses. I only wish I could test lenses outside of the store (such as riding in a car outside) since that would be more accurate for me than testing them inside of a store indoors. However, I will definitely think more about this brand. I think this is the 3rd time I've read of an eye professional praise this brand (on Reddit) and I'm trying to minimize how much I have to squint when outside (to avoid wrinkles), so I really appreciate this advice!"
16491,"For general everyday use, their bronze lens is actually most recommended.  The rose one is neat in the sense that it's made to be more relaxing...literally looking through rose-colored glass.  However, I didn't like it since it was annoying for me to wait for my eyes to adjust to the color.  I bought the Kolohe, which I'm not seeing, so maybe they discontinued them?  They're by far the best pair I've ever had! Just avoid their superthin glass lens if you're clumsy or planning on doing anything adventurous in them :)

Editing this post to your wrinkle comment... fun fact: Maui Jim is the only brand whose lenses are proven to prevent skin cancer around the eyes!"

16494,"I've recently gotten more into sunglasses, but I'm no where near as knowledgeable as some of the other posters in the thread. Anyways, I still wanted to share my experience in case it might be helpful! At the moment, I have three pairs of sunglasses that I wear in heavy rotation:

1. A polarized pair I mainly use for driving. Seriously, polarized sunglasses will change your life. This is the pair that I spent the most on ($100+), and they are a classic wayfarer shape. Some brands I like are Smith (I have these), Maui Jim, and Cole Haan. Ray-Bans are ok, but not worth it for the price if IMO. Polaroid and SunCloud also have some really affordable polarized options.

2. A ""fashion"" pair, that I spent the second most on (~$70). I uses these for walking around, hanging out with friends, traveling, etc. Essentially situations where I need sunglasses but will not be driving, and will have little opportunity to lose them. I get a ""fashion"" style with these. My current pair is a jet-black over-sized cat eye silhouette from Le Spec, my personal favorite sunglasses brand. Quay is also a fun brand. 

3. Cheap pair. Spent no more than $10 on them, mainly get them from fast fashion stores. I use these for when I'm doing a high-action activity (hiking, boating, theme parks) and have a high potential of losing them. I get these in a classic silhouette (current pair is a wayfarer), and I found my pair at Forever 21 for $6.


For the more expensive pairs, I would recommend either getting them directly from the brand if you can, in order to qualify for the warranty, or a retailer with an awesome return policy (in the US), like Nordstrom or Zappos. I get my fast fashion ones from places like ASOS. Discount department stores like Nordstrom Rack and Off 5th also have great quality options at good prices. I've seen polarized Cole Haan sunglasses for $35 at the rack, and $75 Ray-Bans at Off 5th."
16495,"> Off 5th also have great quality options at good prices.

Yes! I've seen some amazing deals on designer sunglasses at Off 5th. Granted, I love crazy styles, so some of it is kinda niche. That said, they have a lot of great classics too."
16496,"Thank you!  This is really helpful.  I'll have to look for polarized lenses (especially since I do a lot of driving...)  Appreciate the store recommendations, too!"
16497,"I am a lover of nice sunglasses.  I've had two pairs of Oakleys, two pairs of Ray-Bans, and one pair of Revo sunglasses over the years.

As far as shapes that will be fashionable for awhile, I think that you'll always be able to find people wearing aviators.  I have the [Ray-Ban Cockpit Aviators] (http://www.amazon.com/Ray-Ban-Cockpit-RB3362-003-32/dp/B001GNBK1S), and I love them.  I have a small-ish face, and the lenses are a little smaller than standard Ray-Ban aviators.  I bought them online after I tried on one of my friend's standard aviator sunglasses.  I knew that the standard ones weren't for me, so I figured I'd give the Cockpits a try.

I've read that people think that Ray-Bans are crappy for the price, but I've had two pairs of Ray-Bans, and I really like them both.  They've held up well over time, I like the styles, and they've protected my eyes from the sun.  Not really sure what people think makes them ""crappy.""  [Revo sunglasses] (http://www.revo.com/) are supposed to be good sunglasses, but a year after I bought mine I couldn't wear them anymore because the ear-pieces had stretched out a ton and I couldn't keep them on my face anymore.  One pair of my Ray-Bans is 10 years old now, and I still wear them.

As far as I can tell, the only place that you'll be able to get them ""on sale"" will probably be Amazon.  I was trying to get a good deal on my Cockpit sunglasses and ended up giving up and paying full price.  I wanted polarized lenses (they're so worth it), though, so that may have been why they never went on sale.

Edit - grammar"
16498,"> I've read that people think that Ray-Bans are crappy for the price, but I've had two pairs of Ray-Bans, and I really like them both. They've held up well over time, I like the styles, and they've protected my eyes from the sun. Not really sure what people think makes them ""crappy.""

Ditto. I have a pair of the clubmasters and I love them. Just recently I scored a pair of the New Wayfarers from a thrift shop and they're great.* I think a lot of people hating on them don't often shop at that price point. I've had a couple roommates complain, saying, ""*Why would anyone spend that much on sunglasses? I have the same style and mine were 5/10/15 dollars.*"" 

Ray Bans get knocked off a lot and are probably one of the few household brands known primarily for sunglasses and frames. No one is surprised that Prada sunnies are super expensive; and not many people recognize when they're buying knock off Prada styles. But Ray Bans are ubiquitous and *seem* more obtainable. The reality is that they're still not cheap, and that frustrates a lot of people. 


^*I've ^become ^quite ^good ^at ^deciphering ^serial ^codes ^and ^evaluating ^quality ^level ^to ^determine ^how ^likely ^an ^item ^is ^to ^be ^authentic. ^I'm ^certain ^these ^are ^a ^genuine ^pair ^of ^Ray ^Bans."
16499,Ray Bans are great.  I'm not sure what people mean when they say they're not worth it--my mom has had a pair since 1974 and they're still in great condition.  I've had a pair of aviators since 2009 that I wear basically everyday and I love them.
16501,"Interesting, didn't know about this.  I'll get back to you in 35 years and let you know if my post-Luxottica glasses have held up."
16502,"I think MFA had a great feature on sunglasses but I can't look it up easily from mobile. With that said:

1) Extreme shapes will go out of style fast. Best thing to do is walk into nordstroms/any mall and just try on pairs that fit your face well. 

2) Ray Bans - honestly i bought mine for $80 from amazon and they were amazing. I've had them over 5+ years with DAILY wear (San Diego weather, yay!). The one thing I have to say is splurge for the polarized lens - so worth it. I've had to change my out because my vision dipped so badly I had to start getting prescription lenses. Maui Jims are great from what i hear I just never found a frame that fit as well as the RBs do. Another place to consider is Warby Parker. They mostly do regular glasses but I've seen sunglasses in their UTC store. Now for something extremely nice (>$1000) my one rec is Leisure Society. They are sooooo frigging sweet but alas a bit outside of most people's price range. 

3) Ive never found glasses on first try. Look for a place wtih a good return policy or try on in store first. 

4) As far as nice glasses on sale - you betcha! May not be the newest styles but there are plenty of online ""high fashion"" websites (gilt, amazon's MyHabit, etc..) I've snatched my friend a nice pair of Celine's for 1/2 price before. I would recommend know which websites accept returns and never deal with fake glasses (As well as being able to tell fakes apart from real ones). 
With that being said - most ""fashion"" glasses are made by Luxottica (think of them as SWATCH group of glasses) if you want better quality for a better price look for a brand that isn't owned by them."
16503,"I think it will be easier to narrow the range based on your needs/habits.  If you're rough on your glasses, you'll want to make sure you've got a sturdy pair.  If you're athletic and want these to be functional in that scenario, make sure you get a pair that will stay on, even if they're not specifically sport glasses.  I love aviators but couldn't stand them when I had long hair because I would always slide them up to rest on top of my head when I didn't need them, and the nose pieces would get stuck in my hair; with a pixie cut, now I love them!

I do love me some polarized lens, and I highly recommend them.  That does rule out some options, though.  Many of the fashion brands, even pricier ones, don't have a lot of polarized options.  Can't for the life of me figure out why.  As /u/bossyfosy said, you may want to have more than one pair for different purposes.  

Personally, I'm cheap with eyewear because I lose things like that so much.  I found a pair of rayban aviators buried in the sand on the beach one day, and within a couple months I had crushed them.  Free lesson for me: expensive sunglasses would not be a good investment!  YMMV, but I've been pretty happy with the $20 pair of no-brand polarized aviators I picked up at Target last summer."
16504,"Not a lot new to contribute as far as styles go (seconding a lot of the advice here!) but make sure you give your cell phone screen a look with the glasses on before you buy -- sometimes the polarized coating on the lenses can make some screens really touch to see. I have Polaroid sunglasses I occasionally wear, and my Samsung phone's screen is hard to see.

Edit: missed two useful words >_<"
16505,"Ahhh! This is a really really great point, and something I never would have considered.  Thanks!!"
16506,Optometry offices will also often let you put in sunglass lenses into whatever frame you want!
16507,"Two things I learned last time I tried on sunglasses:

1. You want the glasses to stay in place when you smile. If the bottom of the lenses are too low, they'll move up. They may look fine if they're too low, but it can get uncomfortable (pressure on your cheek after a while). 

2. Don't put them on the top of your head like a headband -- it warps the hinges."
16508,"Might get buried, but I have to speak up for ray band. I went to sunglass hut, figured out which Ray Ban I liked (the round pink ones) and bought it for almost half the price on Amazon. No joke. About every two months, Amazon has a sale on raybans. In terms of how well they stand up to time, I treat mine like crap, my boyfriend treats his great, and they both still look amazing. I'm all about RayBan."
16509,"I have ray bans and I actually really like them. Going on a year or two of hard use/lots of travelling with them, and they still look great. I have tortoise shell coloured wayfarers, and love them, though want to get another pair in black because sometimes brown doesn't always fit my outfit."
16510,"Ray Bans aren't worth it. Mines were too beat up after a year to keep using them. (Mines were prescription regular glasses, may be different for sunglasses) $300 for frames I couldn't even reuse /:"

16513,"I am a huge sunglasses lover, have a wide sunglasses collection and aviators do look weird on me as well. I love the cat-eye shape, it's a bit retro but also very modern and you can find many sunglasses on sale with that shape. I usually buy from big online website and try to find my favorite shape among the sales section. Good luck !"
16514,Thanks! :)
16515,I have a pair of polarized Ray Ban wayfarers that I would replace in a second if I broke them. They are phenomenal for driving.
16516,"If you like the Wayfarer look (which has been around since the 50s, so no worries about going out of style), then consider these:

http://www.jmartasand.com/shop/nehi-space-black handemade in the USA, constructed in the traditional manner to yield a much stronger, durable frame.

Free shipping + Lifetime warranty + replacement program (if lost or stolen)"
16517,"Everyone has said what I would have said about brands (the comment about having 3 ""types"" of sunnies is solid gold advice) so Imma just speak to the importance of trying them on. 

When it comes to the more expensive purchases ($200.00+) I think having a chance to feel the quality of the frame and seeing how they look on your face is important. Sometimes little details like the width of the arms or like the angle of the nose peice totally change how the glasses feel/look.

Once you've figured out your fave brand/frame ordering online to change up the lense or frame combo is less stressful."
16518,"I would buy expensive sunglasses at a brick and mortar store. That way you can try loads on and they can be adjusted to your face. 

I know you didn't specifically ask this. But I like to put glasses on my head and so I have learnt to avoid any glasses with nose pads that my hair can get tangled in."
16519,"I've had this [pair] (http://www.atozeyewear.com/PERSOL-Po2931s_p_11277.html?gclid=CJC9qM2Jj8sCFQFkhgodYLAMRw) of Persols in the Tobacco - Polar Brown color combo for almost two years now and I love them. They're pricey, but well made and of sturdy construction. While sleek, they don't feel like they're going to break. I also think that they're a pretty classic style that I'll be able to wear for a long time. I definitely recommend them."
16520,"I am obsessed with sunglasses and spend way more than I should. I live in AZ so I suppose I can justify it that way. Oliver Peoples makes good shades if you want more of a casual/fashionable. I don't understand the comments on the Ray Bans as I had my pair a couple of years without issues. Polarized is the way to go! If you are concerned about quality, get them from a retailer that has a good return policy (ie Nordstrom or Costco). Yes, Costco has a decent selection of shades including Ray Bans and Maui Jims. My fav brand is Salt Optics. On pricier end but awesome quality. Also, I bought my husband a pair of Ray Bans recently on jet.com using a 15% discount code"
16521,"Most dog owners are gone from 8-5, for the record. My pets are alone for 10+ hours a day, but they have each other (and are incredibly bonded) so they do fine. I don't love doing this, but we don't have much of an option. We both have to work and my commute is 50+ minutes a day.

This is normal, very few people that have dogs and full-time jobs can get around this. It's about the time you have in the mornings/evenings/weekends to spend time with them that makes the difference. Also the age of the animal is crucial, getting a puppy is NOT advisable. 

My wife and I even foster dogs for a local rescue and those dogs very quickly adjust to the 8-5 schedule, but we play hard in the evenings and avoid puppies.

If you don't want to get a dog, I would recommend a cat, but not a kitten. A young rescue who isn't timid would do well with a toddler."
16522,Ours are alone most of the day. A quick walk around the block and they are happy to sleep on the couch all day.
16523,"Same here. 

Ours are smallish (8lbs and 25lbs) and basically have the run of a 1500sqft house, so they exercise themselves indoors all day. Then, once let outside, run the permiter to chase away all the vermin. By the time they come back in, they're passing out.

Dogs > Puppies"
16524,"At that age I'd stick with a pet rock or one of those ZUMI robot-things. Nothing alive, not unless *you* are willing to take care of it."
16525,"So my husband and I just adopted a cat. We were hesitant on an older cat because we have big dogs and didn't want the cat to hide for the rest of her life. Long story short, this cat is AMAZING! Now there is no guarantee that a cat will be a good fit. But for us, this cat is the perfect piece to our zaney family puzzle. My kids also love our fish tank. http://i.imgur.com/bgTQAWd.jpg"
16526,I wouldn't get any small pets for a younger child. It's too easy for a child to injure or kill them. A dog would be ideal but I agree that you can't leave them from 8-5. Maybe you could get her an adult cat from a foster rescue? Kittens are too small and high maintenance but an adult cat can avoid an overly physical kid and you can choose one based on personality. A good rescue should be able to identify a cat that is playful and likes kids and be willing to do a test run in case things don't work out. We have a 20 month old and a young cat (predates daughter). Our cat is just beginning to enjoy her company and we encourage our daughter to help take care of him (kitty treats) and play with him under our supervision.
16527,What kind of pet do YOU want because you will be the one taking care of it?  A pet is a big investment of time and money.
16528,I wouldn't get a pet either.  What about taking her more places that have kids around or enrolling her in a play group or something like that?
16529,"You could get a older dog that is a calm breed that would likely be okay alone 8-5, as long as you invest some good play and active time when you are around. Puppies obviously won't work... look for a dog who is 1 1/2 to 3 years old. Also this won't be a pet for the toddler, this will be your pet. The child is not going to do anything for this pet but possibly annoy it, and play with a bit, but most kids get bored of that fairly quickly.  Also remember that a dog can be a 15 year investment, it isn't something that is a small commitment. Perhaps a older cat?"
16530,"Don't.

Wait until she's 5 or 6 before getting a pet.

Otherwise, you're just setting yourself up for a ton of extra work."
16531,"My 2 year old LOVES his betta fish, Marvin. He turns his light on in the morning and off at night, and helps with feeding. He will go up and pat the side of the tank gently and say ""good night Marvin"".

But he also loses interest and forgets to feed him, so technically I look after the fish and he sometimes helps, which is exactly why we got something so low-maintenance. We also travel quite a bit, and it's much easier to ask a neighbour to pop in and drop a new pellet of food in after 7 days than to find someone to take care of a dog."
16532,If you do go the aquatic route make sure you learn about tank cycling and proper tank size. It would have saved me a lot of tears and dead fish if my parents had done any sort of research and cycled the tank before plopping a betta or guppies in there. :)
16533,"We 've decided to get two goldfish the weekend , we 'll start small and work out way up in a few years"
16534,"Just FYI, feeder goldfish get huge (up to 18 inches long), live 30+ years, and two require a minimum of 55 gallons. Please check out r/goldfish for more advice...they're far from the easy starter pets everyone thinks."
16535,"Yep, was just about to say this...I hope she doesn't put them in bowls. :("
16536,"Not a midget, that's for sure!"
16537,"Do you plan on having more kids? If the answer is yes I would definitely NOT get another pet. I personally don't think it's wise to get a 2 year old their own pet. Little kids can easily hurt or injure small pets and it's not fair for the child or the pet. With 2 cats and a toddler it sounds like you have your hands full. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

If you insist, thoroughly research this. I know for a fact that rabbits are especially bad for little kids but I'd be really surprised if any reputable sources recommended that 2 year olds handle small animals."
16538,"Rats are really great pets.  They do better in same sex pairs than alone.  They are extremely social creatures and prone to depression and neuroticism when kept alone.  One of the best and worst things about them is their short life span.  They live for 2-5 years, and then they die, usually from tumors.  Great for an early lesson in life and death.  Sad for any child who has to lose their companion.  If you want to ensure your pet will live for more than two years, find a reputable breeder and don't just take the ones deemed too pretty to be snake food.  The feeders pretty reliably drop after two years.  Oh and another thing, they don't really have control over their bladders.  You can poop train them, but males especially leave a small (really tiny) trail of urine everywhere they go.  It's scent marking.  Make sure you're cool with that.


The females are smaller than males.  Girls are hyper, boys are mellow.  If you want playful rats that will learn tricks, go for girls.  If you want a rat that will sit still, go for a boy.  One thing to watch out for, sometimes boys produce a smelly oily substance that, from what I hear, reeks.  I've had rats and never run into a smelly boy, but it's worth mentioning.

Hairless and tailless rats are available.  Hairless require extra work, they don't do well on aspen bedding (pretty much requiring cloth bedding that is changed daily)  If urine builds up on their bedding they get horrible rashes.  They can't control their body temperature very well.  They have very thin, delicate skin that rips and tears easily.  Can be cool, but I think they're more work than they are worth.  Tailless is (in my opinion) cruel.  Rats need their tails, for balance and for self temperature regulation.

Leopard geckos are all the rage these days, geckos in general are pretty great (make sure you don't get geckos prone to parthenogenesis like mourning geckos.  You don't want them spitting out babies every few weeks) .  

Bearded dragons are fairly docile, but require some work with their food.  

Roaches are a much nicer food source to work with than crickets.  They don't smell bad, they don't make noise, they don't bite as much.  Some people don't like roaches though.  

I do not recommend iguanas, tegus, savannah monitors or any other very large lizards.  They are not really beginner reptiles.  Be aware that many reptiles have very long lifespans.  

Snake wise, Ball pythons and corn snakes are docile and readily available.  Incredible beginner snakes.  Corns live in the US so they don't need specialized humidity the way that ball pythons do.  Also, corn snakes are reliable eaters and don't go off feed for months at a time the way ball pythons do.  

Don't buy your ball pythons from petsmart or other major chains (I don't recommend their corns either, but especially stay away from the pythons).  If you look on craigslist you should be able to find a breeder selling normal males for 20-30 dollars.  Make sure they are eating frozen thawed rats (not mice and not live).  Corn snakes can often be found on craigslist for 10-20. 

Most people either underfeed or overfeed their snakes.  Ball python babies should be on rat pups.  Corn snakes should be on mouse pinkies.  Once they don't have a lump in their tummy after a feed, go up to the next size. Feed them in their enclosures.  Some people used to think that you had to feed them in a separate container, but these days, we know better.  It doesn't make them aggressive and is one of the many things that would make your ball python stop eating.    

I don't recommend large snakes like burmese python, reticulated python, boa constrictor, or carpet python.  I also don't recommend bull snake, pine snake, or king snake.  They just don't have that ultra mellow attitude that you find with balls and corns.

Other snakes I recommend: african house snake, kenyan sand boa, and western hognose snake.

Have you considered Tarantulas, giant cockroaches, or an ant farm.  If you're looking for something that lives in a tank and doesn't require much care, bugs are easy as it gets.  They aren't great for kids to hold, though.  and there's also the fact that they are bugs and some people don't like that.

Any animal you choose is going to be much easier to deal with if you get an adult.  With adults you can check for temperament and overall health.  You don't have to deal with them when they are their most delicate.  

Sorry for the wall."
16539,"I would happily do snakes but my SO isn't really a fan. I had a ball python when I was younger that I had for close to 10yrs. I also had a burmese python who I had for about 7yrs (and about 6ft long) when  I had to get rid of her. I loved my burmese. She was pretty mellow and would always just hang out on me. I had to move to a small apartment and now longer had the space for her so I wound up giving her to a friend that was able to build a large custom enclosure for her. Growing up we also had garter snakes and a bullsnake. We always bought frozen or pre-killed feeders. 

I've had iguanas but I'm not a fan of the smell and no matter how much attention they got, ours were fairly aggressive (not sure why). 

I've always really wanted a Chameleon but I haven't spent much time looking into the upkeep for them.

Maybe we'll look into rats. I've had other friends suggest them as well and say they're fairly good companion pets."
16540,"Chameleons are expensive and don't live all that long.

Rats are great, but, honestly, your two year old would probably be just as well off with a plant.  And with two cats it will end up being less work for you."
16541,I did buy him two terrariums of carnivorous plants. They were seeds so I'm still waiting to see if they sprout.
16542,"I think you're likely to have your hands full trying to keep carnivores alive.  Those terrariums are pretty rough.  If they are the ones from dunecraft they guarantee their seeds will grow.  If they dont sprout, send an email to customer service."
16543,I don't know how well a bunny would do with a small child... from what I have heard it is surprisingly easy to overstress or mishandle a rabbit and cause its death.
16544,I didn't know that but we have been considering adopting a bunny from a rescue. Looks like we will wait awhile to get one.
16545,"We just got my son's first pet, actually: Hermit crabs! They're low on maintenance and super interesting to watch. He can grab them (with reminders to be gentle) and have them walk around the floor. 

We love them!"
16546,I completely forgot about hermit crabs. My brother and I had one as kids. I feel like it didn't live very long though.
16547,"They actually have a life-span of 10 years! If they didn't live long, it sounds like something went wrong."
16548,"I think in the wild they have lifespans of well beyond that... 20-30+ years, depending on the species."
16549,It could just be remembering incorrectly. I was pretty young when we had him. You dont always have the greatest concept of time when you are little.
16550,Of course.
16551,"Hermit crabs are definitely super low maintenance and pretty tolerant of...mild neglect, let's say. Read up on them and do them right (proper aquarium/bedding material, foods, etc.) and they are a good option."
16552,An ant farm?
16553,"> two cats

> a rabbit (or small mammal), some sort of reptile

> I remember we had one that was a dick and would pick on/kill the other 

Given the above, I can't possibly imagine what could go wrong with the animals in your house. You are quite literally setting up the circle of life with the cats and the small mammals (or the snake and small mammals!). When the two year old lets the small mammal or small reptile loose, the cats might pounce.

I know in some cases there can be inter-species socialization but you could be teaching your son quite a lesson.

I'd stand pat with the cats before adding any more to the mix, unless you want them for you and only for you."
16554,"Growing up we had 3 cats, a dog, 2 iguanas, a hedgehog, 2 parakeets, 2 snakes, a hamster, a 50 gallon tank and a 20 gallon tank of fish. Everything lived without one killing the other. Although, the cats did try quite often to take out the birds."
16555,"We had a never ending supply of ""presents"" from our cats. Mice, squirrels, birds, lizards and the occasional snake. It's highly dependent on the setting."
16556,My male cat used to do this when he was younger and lived mainly outside. The older he's gotten the less interest he's seemed to having in catching things. My female is scared of her own shadow and wont even kill bugs.
16557,"I know a few people who have loved pet rats. The apparently are better than hamsters (they are sociable, and easy to train)"
16558,"If you aren't in the US, I would suggest a Giant African land snail. (they are legal in the UK) They make awesome pets. 

You could get a pet rat. I used to have them, they are great. Sturdy enough to handle both the kid and the cats. 

I am terrible with fish, mine *always* die, and those are the only 2 small animals i have really enjoyed having. Hopefully you will get more suggestions!"
16559,I second the rat suggestion. They're smart and clean and very social.
16560,"Sadly, I am in the US. I would never have thought of a snail for a pet though. That would be kinda neat."
16561,"When I was little, I caught a snail for the first time and was allowed to keep it as a pet. Just a regular garden snail. They're fun to hold and let crawl around your hand and arms. And they fit in larger toy cars and doll houses! As long as you can get your child to be gentle with it, it would be a cute first pet."
16562,I can picture my son putting it on his truck and driving it around. He already uses the dead junebugs he finds as passengers.
16563,"I would like to put in a third recommendations for rats! Buy a bonded pair, preferably male. They are really loving, and incredibly patient creatures."
16564,I've had rats for 3 years. They are incredibly expensive when you factor in appropriate housing and vet bills and they absolutely must be kept in pairs.  Good exotics vets are also few and far between.
16565,We have mostly large animal vets where we live (farming community) so that's a good thing to factor in.
16566,"If you don't have access to, or can't afford vet care for exotics.  Do not get one. 

Or if you don't have access to ethical breeders or rescues for your exotics.  Don't get one.  Big box pet stores are not good places to get pets."
16567,"Do you have a small (or large) garden? Guinea pigs are fairly low-maintenance, can be petted and if you have two will keep each other company. If you have a secure yard, you don't even have to stress too much if one gets out of their enclosure. 
On the other hand, at two, I would suggest you involve your son with cat care first. Not litter handling, but he is old enough to fill up the cat food bowl and the water bowl (my son does this). Also gentle hands when petting and so on."
16568,"I had guinea pigs when I was 10. Hated them. Shit everywhere, including in their food and water bowls. Peed on me when I out them in my lap. Boring as heck after the first few months. They basically just waddle around and aren't smart enough to do anything interesting. And squeak really really loud when they want something. Plus all that shit stinks so you're constantly cleaning out the cage. Worst pets ever."
16569,I've never heard good recommendations for guinea pigs.
16570,"He's good with the cats. He is best friends with my male cat. My cat has been very loving toward him since birth and he is very gentle. He has a lot of contact with different animals (dogs, cats, chickens, horses, goats and cows) so I've always taught himbthe to gently touch animals. He's always looking for the cats and wanting to give them affection.

Our entire property is wide open. 6 acres and no fences at all."
16571,"One thing to consider is that lots of small animals have short lifespans.  So, if you're going to get a small animal there is a good chance it will die before your son is old enough to form long term  memories of having a first pet 

Also, small birds and mammals are not generally a good match for cat safe homes. 

I'd honestly stick with a dog for now, if possible.  An adult or senior dog will be a way better companion for your son than any exotic.  Less fragile and will be able to hold its own against the cats. 

However if you do decide for an exotic, I'd get a lock for the cage, so you have control when the animal is let out.  Otherwise your son will , at some point, open the cage just to play with it for a second, and then put it back and get distracted before closing it properly and then it escapes."
16572,"I’d vote no on hamsters personally. 

They’re just a mess. They can escape (neighbor just cut through her drywall because somehow hamster got in there and then couldn’t get back out), they don’t always do well in pairs (had 2 growing up. Well 1, who always killed her partner so a rotating second hamster), and they get the shits and die pretty easily (niece upgraded her hamster to a dog when it died a week after they brought it home). One of my friends got one and her therapist was like ‘wtf were you thinking? Never get a hamster!’ Lol. 

I know you said space is tight, but a small dog might be a good fit. Particularly if you can find an older one that is good with kids. We had our Pomeranian in 2 NYC apartments that were like ~800 sq feet and he was fine with it. He got walks twice a day and mostly wanted to sit near the window and sunbathe."
16573,"Really for a 3.5 year old a grown dog/cat are likely the only common pets that are going to sturdy enough to hold their own if a preschooler plays too rough with it.

Assuming all interaction with the pet will be well supervised then a large rat would be a good choice. They are less delicate than hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, reptiles and most other small animals; although a tight squeeze or child falling on top of them would still be potentially horrific events. Plus most tend to love to get up close to people and get lots of pets & attention. They are smart and can quickly learn little tricks. They are also pretty clean and will usually avoid going to the bathroom unless they are in the corner of their cage that they have designated for that.

Biggest downside is the all chewing. Rats (and all other rodents) are going to spend half their day gnawing on things. However being in a playroom rather than a bedroom at least means they hopefully aren't going to keep anyone up all night listening to them chewing up everything and anything in their cage."
16574,I second a rat! They're like tiny dogs with ugly tails :D I loved having rats as a kid.
16575,"Don’t get a guinea pig.  They require a shit-ton of work, they have to be housed in pairs, they need a lot of feed which gets expensive, and if something goes wrong with their health you are looking at huge vet bills (worse than dogs or cats).

In fact all small and exotic pets have lots of little idiosyncracies and needs that make them high cost and maintenance.  I’d probably wait for the move and get a dog."
16576,Bearded dragons are pretty cool.
16577,"I don't have any experience with reptiles, but any interest in rodents? I wouldn't recommend hamsters (I had a couple when I was a kid and I remember them biting and not being receptive to pets), but guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats may be worth considering. I had friends with these types of pets when I was a kid and they all seemed pretty happy with them. Guinea pigs and rabbits are also featured in my local SPCA's animal education classroom and are handled by kids frequently, so they could be good options for a gentle toddler's first pet. 

Also, I wouldn't completely rule out a dog if that's your preferred pet. Some dogs are perfectly happy to be apartment couch potatoes with little space. A dog rescue organization with a foster program or one that is able to thoroughly evaluate a dog's history and behavior (e.g., my local SPCA evaluates the dogs at the facility and handpicks a few to interact with the kids during animal education) should be able to help match you with a dog that fits your needs."
16578,"I just want to point out that rats have a life span of 2-3 years, guinea pigs tend to live 5-8 years and house rabbits are more like 10-12.  So bear that in mind when you're thinking about pets, because it's a commitment longer than many people think."
16579,"Rats are great pets. They’re sweet and easy to train. You need at least two though, since they’re social animals. I had several a few years ago and I miss them desperately."
16580,"That's a tough one, because honestly I think cats and dogs are the best pets for youngish kids who want a pet you can ""pet"". When you say you don't have the space for a dog, can you clarify what you mean? I ask because many breeds of lower-energy dogs-- which is what matters, not the dog's size-- do fine in small spaces including apartments."
16581,"So, I'm in the same boat (except I already have 2 dogs).

I picked up a 55 gal tank with a load of reptile stuff on the cheap.  Picked up a few other things, got the tank temps stable for a Bearded Dragon, and was ready to bring my 3.5 year old to pick out her new pet.  She's been asking about her dragon for about 2 weeks at this point, and honestly, I've always wanted a beardy too.

At the store with my wife, 3.5 year old and 9 month old.  Wife stumbles across a sign that says reptiles are NOT recommended for households with kids under 5 due to salmonella risks.  Instantly shut the whole thing down, understandably.  I didn't even think about salmonella risks, mostly because I know about proper hygein and cleaning for reptile pets (had turtles once upon a time).  So, now I have this 55 gal tank and stand.  Lights, accessories, whole nine yards.  Nothing to put in it.  Rodents are a no go, reptiles are a no go, and fish are a no go.  I've been thinking about what to put in this tank.

I stumbled across the idea of Hermit Crabs.  They carry no human-communicable diseases.  Extremely social and do well in groups.  Colorful shells.  Like to climb.  Fairly easy upkeep from what I've read.

Might be a good idea?  Not really something you pet, but you can hold em in your hand I suppose.  Anybody of experience with these lil guys?"
16582,I'd recommend rats or guinea pigs.
16583,"Bunny? Ferret, other small pet? Or just a small dog?"
16584,Bunnies require a lot more work then people assume and aren't always cool with being handled so it might not be a good choice. My girlfriend's six year old wanted nothing more then to pet and play with my bunny when he was alive and he hated everybody and never participated willingly
16585,"This is all true, but there are lots of adult bunnies put up for adoption so one could assess whether they enjoy being handled by a kid."
16586,I had bunnies as a kid. Reason for my suggestion
16587,"Ferret owner here! I love my four little noodles so much, but they are not an ideal pet for inexperienced pet owners or young children. They require a lot of time, attention, and cleaning. They can and will nip/bite. They also have a lot of health issues which can be costly to treat.

Out of my four current ferrets there is only one that we can trust with our daughter. And even then we would never allow him to be around her unsupervised."
16589,"As I replied to another answer, I had bunnies growing up. That was the reason for my suggestion. 

Ferrets may not be the best, but my friend has one and is completely gaga over him, he doesn't  bite."
16591,"I was considering rats, supposedly they are a little more comfortable being handled than hamsters(?)."
16592,"Yep!!! I never had rats as a pet. I did work with them when I worked at a pet store.  There’s some rats that are amazingly gentle and awesome.  

Look for Rat rescues and you’ll get to see various rats (instead of pet store rats as 90% are used as snake food vs pets), and the rescuers will pick out the ones that are more hardly for kids.   Let your son choose and decide.  

Mice are nice, but too small and can be a little too quick.  

Guinea pigs are awesome, but you need to have two since they’re social animals.  They do make a lot of noise though. 

Small mammals, birds, sugar gliders, chinchillas are a no IMO as they all are more delicate.  

I wouldn’t really rule out rabbits, but look for larger ones. They’re more hardy than smaller bunnies."
16593,"I like this idea. One of my friends rescues rats and they make great pets. They might be hesitant to send a rat home with a young child but it really depends on your kid. Will he understand that he really can't be rough with the rat or rough house around the rat? If he is gentle and calm and understands that if he steps on or rolls on to the rat he will kill it, I think it would be a good fit. They are lovely affectionate animals and if you get one from a rescue you can make sure you get a well socialized rat, they can explain how to avoid any nipping issues, and if it doesn't work out, you can send the rat back to a good home. Just be aware that they don't live a long time."
16594,"Honestly, you really might want to hold out.  There's plenty you can do with animals in the meantime, without making a commitment.

Smaller dogs (apt sized) are really not the best kid dogs.  (I'm not saying all, just in general!)  If a dog is what you ideally want, wait until you find that house and work with a reputable rescue to find a breed/dog that fits your family best.

Rodents aren't really ""toddler pettable"".  Sounds like your child wants something he can cuddle and pet and hold on to.  

Why not get him involved with outside places that involve animals?  Reading with dogs at libraries/rescues.  Find a cat rescue where he can pet them and help take care of them.  

Now would be a great time to teach him that different animals have different needs and qualities and it's best to find a pet that fits everybody.  

My son (age 6) has been begging for an orange and white kitten since he could talk.  He's obsessed with them!  To the point he would tell people we had one and then he started pretending to be one- he has a name and everything.  It became a huge problem, I'd actually have to have the ""we don't lick people"" talk every day.  His teacher gave me the ""here's a crazy mom"" look when I attempted to explain it to her but she quickly learned, lol.  I don't know where this comes from, we've never had any cats!  

But... We can't get a cat.  We have a dog (my husband's PTSD dog) who'd most likely rip it apart.  I explain it the best I can (and how trading our dog for the kitten won't work, and no, the dog can't live outside) and help him understand that our house isn't a good home right now."
16596,"Disagree -- I have a turtle. They get big, poop a lot, and need HUGE fish tanks, and don't particularly like being handled."
16597,"Corn snakes can be good family pets with heavy adult supervision. At that age your biggest concern would be hygiene...little kids tend to put their fingers in their mouths, which is a big no-no when handling reptiles. Otherwise they're extremely low-maintenance (a single betta is more work than a corn), cheap, docile, hypoallergenic, and fairly long-lived...20 years isn't uncommon. Check out r/cornsnakes."
16598,We have corn snakes. They are pretty cool
16599,"Has your husband tried allergy meds? A kitten would be great- low maintenance but fun, cute and high energy. Otherwise I’d say get a small dog, they basically like cats and dont need tons of space."
16600,Cats are also a 15 year commitment.
16601,"My cat is 20 and still oddly healthy. They can live a very, very long time."
16602,I inherited my grandmother's old lady and she's sixteen and going to live forever.
16603,Or longer. My husband's cat lived to be at least 21 years old.
16604,So is a dog? Im failing to see the point of bringing that up.
16605,Because eyou made it seem like cats are no big deal. They might be low maintenance but it’s still 15plus years of maintenance.
16606,"Lifespan wasnt a concern of OP’s. So I didnt mention it, and in comparison to all of the other suggestions, the cat idea is still probably the lowest maintenance that is also cuddly. Sorry for the confusion."
16607,">They might be low maintenance...

Cats are low maintenance? Am I doing  this wrong? Are my cats doing this wrong?"
16608,"I have had: rabbits, geckos, birds, turtles, frogs, hamsters... and after that, the reward:care ratio makes me say CAT is the ""easiest"" pet. 

One needs to budget for vetting, food, and litter. They are aware you are alive, enjoy human affection, will play with a kid, but don't require too much care. Scooping a litter box is less time consuming and easier than ANY of the care for any of the above animals."
16609,Exactly- I grew up in a zoo and we had everything under the sun (still do) so I totally agree!
16610,"You say you don't have room for dogs, but I'm still going to suggest an English Mastiff. They're quite big, yes, but require very little grooming and a daily half-hour to hour walk at most, and are stupidly gentle. Also, they're couch potatoes and typically love children. They require very little space.

The real hard part with them is helping them understand their size, but getting then to be gentle is easier to train for when they're puppies."
16611,"Rabbits! Get a breed like a rec or a Holland lop, that are good with kids. They can be litter box trained just like a cat, but don't have to deal with the allergies! Plus, they can be cuddled and have personality!"
16612,"Rabbits are good and while it’s nice to have two, their social needs can be served by lots of playtime with people!"
16613,"Exactly! And if you get them young they are actually fairly easy to litter train. Like a cat or dog it all depends on if you actually put the effort in while they are young and trainable! 

As far as space goes, if you put the effort in and train them then they are great as house pets (like a cat but without allergies for most people). 

As far as them being delicate/easily hurt, if you get minis yes, but get regular size and they are great, get them young and hold them ALL the time they learn to love people! My parents have two bunnies and they are AMAZING with my 2 year old because we hold them all the time since they got them!"
16614,Fish. No big deal when they lose interest.
16615,No big deal except the OP said no fish.
16616,Rats can be fun pets and are pretty tough. But any pet that shouldn't end up outside sounds like a bad fit for your home. Maybe wait until the kids are old enough to watch the door as they come and go.
16617,"I was going to suggest this too - I used to have rats and they are actually a lot like little dogs! (I also have dogs, and grew up with them so this is not some weird comment from someone who's never lived with a dog). They have definitely little personalities, can be very affectionate and cuddly, and are totally trainable."
16618,"Rats are awesome. I kept them for years. They are a TERRIBLE pet for a toddler. They can bite hard. A toddler isn't going to understand not to pick them up by their tail. They require a lot of attention on your part and they are social animals. You have to have at least two at all times. I'd say age 8 and up for any small mammal. 

If your cat doesn't return just go without a pet for a few years."
16619,"Came here to NOT recommend rats (or other small animals) until the kid is at least 5-- and then, definitely a rat! :) 

Though we've had both, my husband is allergic to both dogs and cats. We're all huge animal lovers, though, so we decided when my dD was 4, we'd get a pet. She proved herself pretty good with the class guinea pig over winter break, so we got a pair of rats (my husband and I had also had rats before DD was born-- they're amazing!) Not only had DD done well with the GP, but she's more gentle with animals than easily 90% of her friends.

She loves them. We love them. I wouldn't give them back. However.

Knowing what I know now, I'd have waited until 5. They're small and active (especially being females) and they won't stay still for cuddles. Being less than a pound, they're somewhat fragile (not so much as hamsters, of course)-- my DD does REALLY well with them, and we still have to get on her case not to squeeze them too hard, etc. Nothinh Bad has happened, but it's just stressful (lessening a bit now, but still), and we generally try not to introduce stressful elements into our lives, because why punish and scold (or reward, or restrict) when you can just wait for a more developmentally appropriate window for certain activities? 

It's ""okay,"" in the end, and the rats are no worse for wear, but like I said-- knowing what I know now, I would have waited."
16620,"Seconding (or thirding or whatever) rats...I don't have any right now but I have had them in the past and they are AWESOME pets.

Plus, they're not as bitey (or at least mine weren't) as the hamsters I had as a kid. Hamsters can't see too well in bright light (they're nocturnal) and it makes them kinda bitey."
16621,Seconding the rats. We have two and they're great intro pets. Our 4yo can do basically all the daily maintenance by herself.
16622,"Glad I'm not the only one who wanted to suggest this :) They are also the least likely rodents to bite in my opinion. If you decide to do this, get her to watch Ratatouille to get excited about getting a rat, lol."
16623,"I would not suggest a hamster. They are not particularly cuddly and take more work than you might think. 

Also you seem very nonchalant about the prospect of your cat dying. I'm not sure ""our cat just died let's immediately get a new pet"" is the right attitude to have. 

I think a fish would be appropriate."
16624,"Fish are work. A lot of work. All of them need a cycled tank. None are suitable for bowls. Goldfish need a friend and at least 40 gallons of water. Bettas need at least 2.5 gallons of water and a heater. Fish aren't easy and it's so tempting for little ones to put their hand in the tank. If they leave the lid off, the fish can jump out and kill themselves.

10/10 do not recommend fish.

Source: own 5+ tanks of varying sizes"
16625,">Also you seem very nonchalant about the prospect of your cat dying. I'm not sure ""our cat just died let's immediately get a new pet"" is the right attitude to have. 

Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed it came off that way. I do believe my cat will come back. I'm 99% sure she's alive. I don't *know* she's alive, but I'm sure she is. My daughter just associated that street with danger and made her own conclusion. It just made me wonder what would happen if I'm wrong. We wouldn't get another pet right off the bat. We would take time to research recommended pets and try to get one that gets along with my daughter. My inquiry was just general curiosity should it actually happen.

>I think a fish would be appropriate.  

She's very affectionate and would want something to hold and cuddle."
16626,"Oh don't worry I understand, it just seemed that you thought of a pet as more of just a play thing for your daughter but good to hear that's not the case. 

I really can't think of any pet that would be appropriate for a child that young that is also cuddly. Maybe you should just look into ways to prevent your cat getting out. Is she microchipped?"
16627,"Yeah, she's microchipped."
16628,"Yeah, fish are going to get boring very quickly for a young child, and like hamsters, they require a lot more specialized care than people realize."
16629,"I love hamsters (But my partner doesn't :( ), amd yes; they aren't pets for kids.

They sleep when kids want to play, they play when kids want to sleep, and if you try and interrupt that cycle you get bitten. They're small and need to be treated with care, not as rough as little kids can be; if they're mistreated, they'll bite or run off and hide. They need to be regularly cleaned out and played with (During which time they may bite). They only live for a short time (After which they stop biting).

And, oh yeah, they bite."
16630,I don't think it's fair for you to say how another person should react about a death in their lives.
16631,"Your cat needs more enrichment, otherwise it wouldn't be interested in escaping. The way you describe the poor thing running out describes a trapped animal under stress attempting to escape. If she does come back, try creating a more engaging environment for her. Lots of ledges, places to climb and play on, places to hide, different kinds of toys, and create a schedule for her,  consisting of feeding, playing, affection, and training. And make sure her litter box is clean, otherwise she'll escape to find a better place to do her business. If you can train her to walk on a harness, take her for walks. 


If she doesn't come back, I would suggest waiting a few years before getting another pet. At least until your daughter can more actively care for it and you can create a more positive environment for an animal. Cats and dogs were never meant to live in an apartment and even though we may live in them, we leave them every day. It's very challenging to create a good environment for animals when you keep them inside.


I suggest starting a window or balcony garden or getting a fish, but make sure to get an appropriate sized tank.  If she wants something cuddly, get her a furby or robo pet. She might like it better once she realizes she can take it anywhere and it won't run away."
16632,"She has a climbing tree that she has never used voluntarily. My husband put her on the second and third tier and she jumped off. We have a squeaky mouse with a rope and rod that she likes to play with and I was able to lure her up to the upper tiers by using that but she just won't climb it. We don't know what her problem is with it.

My kids have tents that she likes to be in. She also has a fleece box with holes that have balls with bells attached that she can swipe. She also has other balls (one resembles a mouse or hamster in a ball) that squeaks we have feather toys. I feel like she has a lot of toys but would rather be outside."
16633,"I don't think the solution is just more toys. The whole environment has to be good for her. She has to feel safe and have her needs fulfilled. The fact that she's running, means she feels trapped. No amount of toys is going to change that. Also, I'll bet she climbs on the tree when you're not home. Cats are like that. If you make a big deal about wanting them to do something, they will resist."
43653,I agree.
16635,"> Your cat needs more enrichment, otherwise it wouldn't be interested in escaping

I think that's probably one of the reasons we got two (aside from the fact that it was a BOGO adoption sale on the kittens at the shelter)...they can play with each other."
16636,"If the reason why you want a pet is for your daughter to cuddle I wouldn't get any at all, she is too young. And if a fish is too boring it's obvious that you don't want to teach her the responsibility part of pet ownership, because it does require work. 

I wouldn't get her any pet at this age"
16637,"Initially we got the cat for my oldest daughter who has autism. We heard about companion animals for people with autism and we decided to get a cat. My landlord has outdoor cat and my daughter would always go pet her. We can't have dogs our apartment but we can have cats, so thought she enjoy having her own. Besides, my daughter was afraid of dogs.

We went to the shelter and we found a cat that we wanted. When we got inside their little shelter room, he didn't want to be held or anything, which was fine for me, but it didn't seem like he would be a good *companion* for my daughter. In that same room was Nessa. My oldest daughter who we were getting the cat for didn't seem to feel anything towards any of the cats. Nessa was (and is) very affectionate and was all over my husband. My youngest daughter's eyes lit up with her and we decided she was the cat for our family. My youngest daughter treated her as her baby. She's the the one who gave her the most attention and fed her. She's a good pet owner and responsible."
16638,How about a [plush](https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Plush-First-Carrier-Sound/dp/B002CU1DCA) pet? There are also kitten variations that make sounds that your toddler can carry around without worrying about one harming the other.
16639,"I have a cuddly toy sabretooth tiger, and my daughter is regularly rough with and mean to him. We've told her we're watching how she handles him, and that while she might want a pet, she's clearly not capable of coping with one yet.

(In practice, we know it would be our pet, not hers. But we still need her to be nicer and not so rough.)"
16640,That's a really cute idea. I've never seen those before. Thank you.
16641,"A hermit crab... they are so cool. You need to get them different sized shells so they can switch out homes as they grow, some food and to clean the tank out every now and again. Super simple and, again, very cool."
16642,That's a great idea. At the mall we passed a kiosk that sells hermit crabs and my kids seemed interested. I know they would love setting up a terrarium and watching the crabs even if the crabs aren't affectionate.
16643,"No no no. 


Hermit crabs are animals that require extreme care and are not fun at all to own. They pinch hard, they require heat and precise humidity to be able to breathe properly, they cannibalize themselves, and many don't like to be held. They can live for decades. These are TERRIBLE pets not only for toddlers, but for most people. 


Not only that, but to accurately care for hermit crabs, you're going to need at least a 20 gallon tank for two of them (and you should have much more, they're social animals), at least six inches of eco earth for them to bury themselves in, you'll have to mist the cage multiple times a day so they can breathe. They need two different types of water -- fresh and salt. You can't use tap water, it will kill them, and you need specific salt to make the salt water. They need to be fed a varied diet. They also mostly burrow -- you're child will rarely see them. They also molt at least once a year...you'll need to have separate enclosures for when it happens, or they eat each other.
 If you don't do these things, you'll have miserable crabs that are slowly suffocating to death (they have gills...they breathe in the moisture). 


My mom got hermit crabs for me when I was younger. They were no fun and seemed sad. When I started googling how to care for them, I felt absolutely guilty and horrible. These animals were sad and suffering, all because the amount of care they needed was too much. I now own them as adults, but they're very boring animals honestly. Your child will probably lose interest within a few days. 


Please do not get hermit crabs."
16644,"Also, it's very rare to find captive bred hermit crabs. Most are caught wild."
16645,"They can also live 20+ years and when they bury themselves to only they can go down for days, weeks, months, or even a year. There will be long periods where you have pet substrate.

Furthermore, they should never be handled. They need the humidity in the tank to breath. Holding stresses them out and gives no benefit to the crab."
16646,"I don't mean to be a jerk, but for future reference in case you're considering buying some, hermit crabs are much more difficult to care for than that. ):"
16647,"Depending on your views on certain pets, you might not like this.

Get a pair of rats. 

They are the hands down best pet for kids. They are jello slinkies in fur, and they love love LOVE attention. They snuggle and give kisses and love being carried around. Kids and rats can share snacks, rats can learn how to fetch and love to chase feather wands. Rats love snuggles on the sofa while you watch a movie. They are *the* best pet for children.

Care wise, rats are fairly easy. They need to be kept in pairs, that is not optional. They can and will die of depression, or become unhealthily attached to objects or people, or become agressive. A cage that gives 2 sq feet per rat is needed. They need a fully funished cage; hammocks, toys, hides, scraps of fabric or paper, baskets, multiple levels. They can be litter trained but they also do well with a full cage of litter. They need either paper pellets or aspen shavings, cedar or pine will make them sick. Cedar can lead to organ failure. Pine will give them a respiratory infection. Do not give your rats a wheel unless you have one that is HUGE. It has to be big enough for a full grown rat to run on with a straight back. Rats can get up to a foot not including their tail so wheels are mostly a no go. They need special rat food, but they can eat almost everything off your table. The only bad foods are: spicy, onions, caffiene, carbonation, citrus, and avacafo pits and skins. Everything else is edible for them.

Honestly they are a good fit for children that won't crush them. Get rats from a breeder, not the pet store. It costs more but your rats will be friendly off the bat instead of having to work with them for months. Rats do not need time to settle into the cage before you interact with them either, you can play on the first day. Rats do not bite, I have owned and bred rats for going on 7 years and have been bitten twice; once by a rescue who had issues from his previous home, and once by a rat that had to be grabbed *hard* because a dog was chasing it. Neither broke the skin, so I don't really count them as bites. Never feed your rats through the bars, or they will get overly excited at fingers through the bars and try to drag you in. 

Man I could talk about rats forever, but I'm going to cut it short. Get rats!"
16648,"Thank you for such a detailed response. Someone else suggested going to a breeder. I'll look into it and if it we can give it the proper amount of attention and if we can figure out where to place its home, then that seems like a cool choice. I literally know nothing -- not even about how much attention it needs -- so I have a lot of research to do. And of course we will hold them and play with them to make sure they're friendly and not aggressive."
16649,"We had the same situation with our cat and our kids, ages 1 to 4. Cat escaped at every opportunity, and the kids didn't know how to be gentle with him either. We ended up giving him away - we were lucky enough to actually find someone who wanted our adult cat. 

Now we've just decided to hold off on pets until the kids are a little older and we can trust them not to chase or throw things at an animal."

16652,It's very hard if they were not indoor cats since being kittens. I like how you threw the ia there on this subreddit haha
16653,"We try to make her an indoor cat but it's virtually impossible. We live in an apartment complex with 25 units. It's very small and it's gated, so my kids come and go as they please. My cat is very fast. She will go from one end of the living room to the other once she realizes either one of my kids is going to open the screen door. The fault isn't entirely on them though. Sometimes when I'm coming inside, she positions herself near the door hinge and gets out through a narrow opening. I stick my leg in like I'm gonna kick her (I would never actually kick or hurt my cat, I just kick my leg around to scare her away from the door) and I have thunder thighs, so I need a biggish opening to get my leg in. Sometimes my kids think the door is latched when it's not. 

A long time ago I Googled how to prevent cats from escaping and all the forums were understandably against negative reinforcement, so I would feel bad about squirting with water when she gets near the door. I also read a suggestion that was to greet them in a specific spot in the house when you get home so they would rather go to that spot for attention than leave, but my cat never greets us when we get home. Sometimes she hangs out in the bedroom or bathroom. I'm at a loss with how to make her want to stay inside. Forcing her to stay is seemingly impossible."
16654,"Have you tried putting a ledge near your door that your cat can hop up onto instead of darting out? Jackson Galaxy has some great tips about these situations.

Also, here's a helpful link. http://pawesomecats.com/2016/10/07/stop-door-darting-behaviour-in-cats/"
16655,Jackson Galaxy is my spirit animal. >^._.^<
16656,She sits on the windowsill but I'll look into getting something like that. Thank you.
16657,"You could also do what I did with a former cat of mine and fill an empty coke can with gravel or other smallish rocks and then tape the opening shut with duct tape. Whenever she'd do something I didn't like, I'd shake that thing and it would scare the pants off her. It probably wouldn't be too hard to keep one stashed near the front door or other place where the cat tries to escape and just give it a shake when she tries to get near the door."
16659,"Thanks. :)

My former cat haaaaaaaated that thing and if I just picked it up (even if I didn't shake it), she run."
16660,"I'd get a goldfish, or a cricket."
