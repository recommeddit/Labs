59110,"Dior Hypnotic Poison has been my go-to for 15 years, it has always attracted positive attention. It has such an exotic, warm scent. Very sexy."
59111,"Mine, too. It's just gorgeous."
59112,dahlia and vines by nest gets me the most compliments from other women—men don't typically compliment me.
59113,"Indigo from Nest has gotten me tons of compliments! It's such a complex and intoxicating scent. Fuck it, I'd recommend anything by Nest."
59114,Midnight Fleur by Nest is my favorite perfume! I really want to smell their new Black Tulip fragrance as the notes sound like something I would enjoy.
59116,"Here, fragrance net has 1 oz bottle for only $19. The deal is only until the end of today, so hop on it!

http://www.fragrancenet.com/perfume/coach/coach-poppy-blossom/eau-de-parfum#253737"
59117,Yes the D&G Light Blue. I put it on my my husband immediately starts burying his head in my neck to smell me. He bought me a huge bottle of it so I could use it frequently.
59118,I've never worn perfume but I'm interested. Is this something one wears every day? Or is perfume a special occasion type of deal?
59120,My piano teacher would get strong migraines from perfumes and body sprays - always good to check if the people around you can handle it :)
59121,"Mine is definitely Light Blue, by Dolce and Gabanna. Hands down my favourite perfume."
59122,The men's cologne version of this is hnnnnngggghhhhhhh.
59123,I swear that cologne is my weakness. SO GOOD.
59124,"Mine is Moschino, ""I love love,"" which is soooo similar to Light Blue."
59125,Came here to say this!!
59126,"I love this one so much, and to my delight, it also gets copious compliments."
59127,Tom Ford Black Orchid and (surprisingly) Noir Tease from Victoria's Secret!
59128,"Yes!  I love Black Orchid!  So far it's the only perfume I've found that doesn't smell soapy on me, not that I've done a ton of looking.  I've been stopped on the street multiple times because of it.  Smells amazing.  Sometimes I also just wear jasmine oil (cut with a carrier oil, of course!) and I get tons of compliments on that too."
59129,"I feel silly saying so... But Fantasy by Britney Spears. No joke. I never stopped wearing it when I got past my teenage years, and I get compliments from strangers on it. I'm embarrassed to tell anyone what it is, but hey, whatever works."
59130,"By far, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle!"
59131,"Yas! Never met anyone else who wears it, but I love it."
59132,"Marc Jacobs by Marc Jacobs. It's not as commonly known compared to Lola or Daisy, but I love the light jasmine nectar smell. It's my daily wear scent. For evenings, I go with J'adore Dior."
59134,Nirvana white is my favorite!
59135,"Ugh, I used to get TONS of compliments when I would wear old formula of Miss Dior Cherie. They changed the formula and it smells ordinary and lame now. So I save my last bottle for every now and then so I can savor it.

But I found an acceptable replacement, which I also get compliments on (though not as many) - Coco Mademoiselle. It's not too heavy, not too sweet. It's a perfect every day perfume."
59137,I have no clue because the new formula is clearly inferior. I'm just glad someone else thinks so too!
59138,Bombshell by Victoria Secret. It's killer!!
59139,"Burberry Brit. 

Everyone loves it. It came out in 2003 so it's not super expensive anymore. 

My best friend sprayed some of mine on before we went out, and her boyfriend liked it so much he bought it for her for Christmas."
59140,That was my favorite in high school! It was the first perfume I ever loved:)
59141,"I don't wear it anymore, but a lot of people *flip* over Juicy Couture's Viva la Juicy. I used to carry a rollerball when I was in college in case I felt gross after walking across campus, and people would always comment on it when I walked into a classroom."
59142,Flowerbomb by Viktor & Rolf
59143,"Tori Burch ""Eau de Parfum"", it's sold at Sephora. That or my Marc Jacobs ""Oh! Lola""."
59144,">That or my Marc Jacobs ""Oh! Lola"".

Hah, I'm wearing that right now. The solid version. It's ok, but feels so... mature."
59145,"Nectarine and Honey by Jo Malone! It's floral, smells like sunshine to me (??) and it's kind of a ""soft"" scent since they were designed to be layered."
59146,"My partner is obsessed with the way I smell in Britney Spears Curious, lol. It's what I wore regularly when I was 20 and we started dating so he associates it with good memories I guess, lol."
59147,Ralph Lauren Blue
59148,"In my experience from working with perfumes - certain bases sit better on certain skins! We had this book at the chemist I worked at that told you what kind of base (like floral or musk or fruity - I can't remember now but there were SO MANY) a perfume was and what other perfumes had a similar base. I LOVED Angel by Thierry Mugler and also used to wear (and get a lot of compliments on) Lolita by Lolilta Lempricka - turns out according to this book they were the same type of perfume! Also stayed on my skin the longest. 

I recommend going to a place that has heaps of sample bottles out, smelling some on cards, picking one and spraying it then wearing it for the day! I used to love a Dior one, tried it on my skin and got the worst headaches. Try this for your favourites and then pick the one that lastest the best/smelt the best on your skin because they really can change in scent once they mix with the oils on your skin :)"
59149,Yep your chemical makeup definitely plays a part!
59150,"Honey by Marc Jacobs! 
It draws compliments every time I wear it. It's the perfect day perfume. I've gone through two bottles of it so far. It's so good!"
59151,Ralph Lauren's Romance
59152,Dot by Marc Jacobs. Plus the bottle is adorable.
59153,Pink sugar!
59154,This one is sooooo good if you want to smell sweet :>
59155,"Tom ford jasmine rouge and cafe rose
Thierry Mugler alien
YSL black opium"
59156,Alien by Thierry Mugler! I have had guys stop me just to tell me how good it smells and they ask about it.
59157,I second Thierry Mugler Alien! I will always get asked about my perfume when I wear it.
59159,Yes! I love Gwen Stefani's scents. I got so many compliments on Love. I really liked her L.A.M.B. one as well. Haven't bought anything from her in a long time though.
59160,"Killer Queen by Katy Perry. I was skeptical at first.. but it smells amazing and my husband loves it. I used it as my daily fragrance.

However! Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture will always be my all time favorite. Honorable mention: Very Sexy by Victoria Secret makes me want to take my own clothes off."
59161,"Everyday: Tease - the Victoria's Secret fragrance

Going out/want to feel a little nicer: Sage and Sea Salt by Jo Malone"
59162,"Not A Perfume by Juliette Has A Gun. All their scents get compliments (I have a sampler), but people go nuts over that one."
59164,All their names are pretty great. Lady Vengeance and Mad Madame are my favorites.
59165,[clean warm cotton](http://www.sephora.com/warm-cotton-P179007) gets compliments literally every single day I swear it. from strangers and shit.
59166,"My go to light scent is Incanto Shine by Salvatore Ferragamo. I've gotten some compliments on that. 

My date night perfume is Lady Gaga Fame. I originally bought it because the bottle is pretty."
59167,"Fancy by Jessica Simpson

Euphoria by Calvin Klein

Jasmine Nor by Bvlgari

Eternity Moment by Calvin Klein

Currently wearing Eternity Now by Calvin Klein - its so fresh and pretty!"
59168,I always say something when I smell someone wearing Drakkar Noir.
59169,"I'm poor so I can't afford the real stuff, but my go to daily perfume was a knock off of 'happy' by god knows who I can't remember >< but my all time favorite and most surprising to people is diors poison! My mom gave me a knocked off bottle she got (she stole her moms in the 80s, and I stole hers in the early '10s) and I recently found an almost exact replica, in an oil base compared to the normal bases. It's so deep and sexy!!"
59170,Stella from the Tocca line. It is sublime! You can find it at Sephora for a sample.
59171,Molecule 01 by Escentrics Molecules. It's a bit of a cult buy and I can never smell it on myself but it's the sort of thing where strangers passing by stop me to ask what it is!
59172,"Lolita Lempicka. This is what I imagine Maleficent would smell like. Forest-y (lol not sure that's a good thing), mysterious, feminine."
59174,Tell me about it. I still have my empty bottle with me because it's too precious to throw out!
59175,I get a ton of compliments when I wear rose oil from this lovely little hole-in-the-wall shop.
59176,"Yay, another essential oil wearer! I wear a lavender/rose mix on dates and bergamot for fancy occasions. I love smelling like tea."
59177,Chloé Love
59178,"I wear a knock off ""bombshell"" that I buy at Walgreens for like 16 bucks. I get so many compliments on it it's the only thing I wear anymore!"
59180,I *love* my Gucci Guilty (for women)! I'm buying Gucci Bamboo next.
59181,Gucci Bamboo is my go-to for everyday. I love it!
59182,"I looked Lovely up on ebay and amazon, it seems like you can get some for a little over $20, free shipping from both. Might be worth looking into!"
59183,I'm pretty sure Narciso Rodriguez' perfume is a dead-ringer for SJP's Lovely. The one in the pink bottle.
59184,"I loved ""lovely"" as well!!!!!! I also have her ""covet"" which is a very mossy, beautiful scent."
59185,Kenzo's Flower since I can't get my usual Vera Wang abroad.
59186,Are you talking about Kenzo Fleur? In the squareish bottle with pink floral designs on it?
59187,Elizabeth & James rose and Derek Lam 10 Crosby ellipses both get me a ton of complements!
59188,"D&G light blue, but for some reason I get way more compliments from men when I wear the lotion and not the spray."
59189,Origins Ginger Essence
59190,I love HER by Narciso Rodriguez.
59191,"Tibetan Mountain Temple from Pacifica. It's really nice, kind of an incense smell but not too strong."
59192,"Paradise by Nest. I bought it because someone at a resturant was wearing it and I had to ask what it was. It's amazing, but not too ""sexy"". Like a mix of sexy, fresh and floral."
59193,"Love, by Auric Blends. It's a roll on.  It gets on everything, seeps into my clothes/hair/bed. I get compliments from everyone! It smells amazing. Also the best part is that guys go crazy for it.. Haha!"
59194,Angel by Thierry Mugler
59195,"Most compliments, probably Hermes d'Orange Verte.

Most comments (intrigued but complimentary), Demeter's Grass + Salt Air. My boss says I smell like winters in Montauk."
59196,"I'm still bummed that Clinique stopped making Happy to Be, but my go-to is the classic Happy. When I have it on, no one ever identifies it correctly; something in my body chemistry alters the scent. It ends up being unrecognizable, but soo summery and fun.

If you do go sampling a variety of fragrances, remember to bring a cup of black coffee or a small packet of coffee beans. Smell one, then smell the coffee. It helps cleanse your nose-palate (I'm sure there's a real word for it but oh well) so you can smell the next one more clearly."
59197,"Hermes 'Eau des Merveilles', Lancome 'Miracle' and Chanel 'Coromandel'."
59198,I wear Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers 'Love' and every dude I've dated goes nuts over it.
59199,"Eau Flirt by Harvey Prince...discontinued and had to get my hands on a bottle through ebay but I get so many compliments and I think it's made to be an attractant (hence the name). 

Also have tried different perfumes with pheromones to see if there is a difference in people's reaction. I noticed one by Raw Chemistry that tends to get people's attention :)"
59200,"They just renamed it Temptress, it's still available! It's just not green anymore."
59201,This is so weird but the first Justin Bieber perfume. The one in the obnoxious flower bottle. I guess it works well on me.
59202,"I've never found a perfume I could wear. Everything turns gross on my skin. I've never tried any of these, though, so maybe I just need a higher quality of perfume! Lots of great suggestions to try."
59203,Spray in your hair!
59204,"this is a great tip, and something I've never considered! thanks!"
59205,Meow (I think) by katy perry
59206,"Miami glow by jlo is my summer perfume, I like white musk from body fantasies ($5 at Walgreens) and Burberry body for winter"
59207,Geurlain Idylle---people have followed me down the supermarket aisle to ask what I'm wearing.
59208,Live colorfully by kate spade :3
59209,"I do Gucci Rush and J'Adore and definitely get compliments on both of those. I also wear Outremer Rose as an everyday thing, because it's pretty inexpensive, and I've gotten a few compliments on that as well. My favorite ever was Estee Lauder Dazzling Silver, but it was discontinued. I've been hanging on to the empty bottle for years so I can smell it every now and then."
59210,Santal 33! I always get compliments when I wear it.
59211,I used to wear the orange Chance parfum by Chanel and got a few compliments but for the past year or so I have been wearing Giorgio Armani Si parfum and now sometimes I get stopped in shops getting oh my god ypu smell amazing whats that?! And all my friends always say how nice I smelt.
59212,"I've been wearing Mackie for 17 years. I haven't smelt it in almost as long, except for the first mist.

I can't wear anything else. My 15 year old daughter refuses to hug me and says I don't smell like mom anymore if I do. 

My husband always says I smell good after I put it on, but he's a serial complimenter sooo....I'm stuck with it for now. Or until my supply runs out, because it's a bitch to find!"
59213,"Wonderstruck Enchanted by Taylor Swift. My SO said that when a girl/women walks by with this scent it makes him miss me because its my scent xD. Also noticed that every time I wear this perfume, my man gets more aroused and I get lots of complements from people :)"
59214,My embarrassing one is With Love by Hilary Duff. I got so many compliments from strangers when wearing it!
59216,"Oh no! I'm sorry to lead you astray, I got mine at Marshalls originally so that makes sense. It's a good scent but not worth paying that much for it!"
59217,"DKNY apple perfumes, the green is my favorite. I think it's called 'Be delicious'"
59218,"Jo Malone, earl grey and grapefruit. They come as two separate fragrances and the idea is you mix them or use independently. Whenever I wear them I get complimented."
59219,Virgin Island Water by Creed is a light scented instant trip to the tropics. It's light and airy with a top note of lime and a coconut undertone. I always get compliments on it during the summer.
59220,I like to blend essential oils. I get way more compliments on those scents than when I wear perfume.
59221,coconut oil...
59222,juicy couture!!!
59223,"Someone just gave this to me for Christmas. I'm in my 30s and was worried it would smell too ""young"" on me. People are surprised when I tell them what it is. It smells really good."
59224,"Well, I'm in my early thirties but signorina by Salvatore ferragamo and mademoiselle by Chanel are my two go-tos."
59225,"Twirl by Kate Spade, unfortunately, it's discontinued :("
59227,Beautiful by Estée Lauder!
59228,"Oddly enough, Red from Bath & Bodyworks"
59229,"Euphoria by Calvin Klein! 
I love it because it smells slightly different on each person but it always smells great!"
59230,"I once spilled a french vanilla coffee on myself, and got more compliments about how good I smelled than any perfume I’ve ever worn...does that count?"
59231,"When I started dating my girlfriend, I was suddenly attracted to everything vanilla. My drinks from coffee bean always had to have vanilla and even my car scents were vanilla scented. Thing is I didn't really realize I was doing this. Then my girlfriend mentions how her perfume is vanilla based and it all made sense! I kept wanting to be reminded of her even when she wasn't around. Anyways, I love the smell of vanilla now"
59232,That's cute as fuck dude
59233,I was thinking the same thing. No homo though.
59234,This is adorable
59235,I once heard that vanilla tends to be more appealing to men than any other perfume scent.
59236,Get yourself a guy who loves the smell of your vanilla perfume and then becomes attracted to said vanilla.
59237,I'd say that it counts
59238,So now I spill coffee daily on myself or what
59239,It's the most sensible answer I can think of
59240,My most complimented scent is...my hair gel. 🤷🏼‍♀️
59241,"Same. The sandalwoody vanilla-y fragrance of Kevin Murphy products is now a critical part of my own “signature” scent. It ties in really nicely with my favorite perfume, which is Le Labo‘s Patchouli 24, and every time I use KM curl cream, I get loads of compliments on it."
59242,Clearly the common denominator is vanilla
59243,"When I was in my 20's, my friend told me that a woman should have a signature scent. I liked that idea and chose Dune, by Christian Dior. At age 63, I still wear it. I still love it, I get lots of compliments.  

I'll have to tell my kids to have the undertaker spritz it on me at my viewing. My friends will know it's me."
59244,My mother wears the same one! I now associate that smell with her
59246,This is hilarious.
59248,Just a joke. Don't worry. We just feel our age sometimes.😊
59249,This is the sweetest comment thread 😅
59250,"I have a friend who is 92 who only now stopped driving and another friend at age 89 still plays golf twice a week.  Your mom has lots of good years ahead of her. (Fingers crossed for us all!)

(A neurologist just told the 92 year old to take 1000 IU of vitamin E twice daily so I’m signing up for that!)"
59803,Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue
59252,"I love this so much and have been wearing it for about 16-17 years or so. 

Back in the day my friends would say they would smell it and think of me."
59253,"Same! I remember wearing it in Grade 10 (am 31 now) and I walked into my class and the girls were like ""Oh my god who is wearing Light Blue"". They loved it."
59254,I've been wearing it for almost 10 now. It's so light and refreshing! I just can't even look at anything else lol
59255,my favorite!!!! also many of my friends'
59256,I wear this perfume all the time. My boyfriend goes CRAZY for it!
59257,I've tried but I hate the way this smells on me.
59258,This shit is insane. Does great things to me.
59259,"Its a nice scent but I dont know why would anyone want to make it their signature scent since literally everyone wears it. I smell it everywhere all the time,  on the subway, in stores etc. 2 women in my office wear it too."
59260,Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream 💙
59261,Seconded. I get comments on it all the time.
59262,"I never tried daisy dream, is there much of a difference from daisy do you know?"
59263,"I have them both and I’m really bad at describing fragrance and nodes, but they’re very different to me! I really do love them both!"
59264,"So am I! I was just going to restock on daisy but maybe I’ll try daisy dream instead, thanks!"
59265,Thirded.  Other women absolutely love it.
59266,"I've never actually bought perfume, too indecisive and unsure of how to find a scent I'll like. But I happen to use a sample of this one lately. maybe I'll just take this as a sign and buy it."
59267,"Sephora offers perfume sample packs! There are a few different options and they come with a coupon for a roller ball or bottle of the perfume if your choice from the samples. This helped me determine that I really strongly prefer light florals on me, no matter how much I want to smell like an amber-scented femme fatale. The samples are enough to wear a few times each, so you can get a sense of the scent when you're in different moods or situations."
59268,Daisy is to die for 💙💙💙
59269,Yes!  One of my 3 staples!
59270,Reading this thread just made me wish we had  the option to smell things through the internet
59271,Be careful what you wish for.
59272,Black opium
59273,I recently purchased the rollerball before committing to the bottle. But I feel so damn expensive and luxurious when I wear it. It also helps that I match the scent to my YSL wallet and feel so great haha
59274,I have both the black opium and the mon Paris couture scents from YSL. I really like the couture. You should try that roller ball also if you are a fan of ysl scents.
59275,The first time I smelled this I had to beg my friend to talk me out of spending over a hundred dollars on some smelly water.  Fuck me it's some good smelling water though
59276,+1 to this. Every. single. time. I wear this perfume I get complimented! Without fail!
59277,I own a lot of high end perfumes but ironically enough I always get tons of compliments from men of all ages when I wear Victoria Secret “Tease” body spray lol
59278,I have a similar response - I don’t wear it anymore but the most compliments I ever received from men was when I wore VS’s “Very Sexy” spray or perfume. They must have figured pheromones out!
59279,My all time favorite
59280,"Oh yes. This is my ""we are going to have sex"" perfume, LOL"
59281,This!!
59282,Either Flowerbomb by Viktor and Rolf or Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford.
59283,Love flowerbomb!
59284,I always get compliments on Flowerbomb.. it’s such a lovely scent :)
59285,Ooh I just got Flowerbomb and have yet to try it.  Tomorrow’s the day. :)
59286,"Ooh need the TF fragrance! I decided on Flowerbomb, but you reminded me to splurge!"
59287,Chloe by Chloe or daisy dream by Marc Jacobs
59288,Chloe for sure! I’m 30F and I also love that my mom used to wear this one when she was my age :)
59289,I love chloe too! And love story too
59291,My mom wore Chloe when I was a kid and it always reminds me of her. :-)
59293,100% every time I wear it I get a compliment
59294,"It has great longevity too, I can put a couple of squirts on at 6.30am and still smell it in the evening"
59295,My all time favourite!
59296,Same here! Lovely floral scent.
59298,"I'm a 27-year-old woman who knows absolutely nothing about scented perfumes (or ""parfum"", as the French bottles say), as my mother never bothered to teach me, and I used to work at Macy's. I get perfumes as gifts sometimes, but I have no idea what to do with perfume in general, or how to use it. This thread is helping a lot!"
59299,"Apply a tiny amount of Vaseline on your throat and wrists and spray your perfume rather than rubbing your wrists, it will make the scent last long."
59300,"I constantly get compliments on Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle. I have a friend who wears Dior Addict though, and on her it is absolutely to die for"
59301,"Yep - I remember the exact moment I became obsessed with this perfume! I would’ve been maybe 15 or 16, and my brother was dating this girl who was somewhat of a celebrity in Australia, so naturally everything she had and wore was expensive. Anyway, the first time I met her she was wearing it but I was far too embarrassed and dorky to ask her. So when they went out, I snuck into my brothers room and found it. That Christmas my family bought it for me as a gift and now it becomes a repeat when I start to run out, it’s my number one staple!!"
59302,Who was the Australian celeb? I gotta know!
59303,Her name is Caitlin Stasey! Most famous for her role in Neighbours but went on to do a few movies which I don’t think were that popular
59304,I LOVE Mademoiselle - but it smells terrible on me.   So I keep a bottle in my car and sprits the upholstery every few days.  And my wife has learned to wear it when she wants my attention - though to be honest I love the stank of her sweat too... so perhaps I’m just a strange woman.
59305,"Same here. I used to wear it allll the time. Also, this guy once smelled it on me and said he name to me. It was so random, but cute, and he’s like “my daughter makes me buy her that perfume every Christmas"
59306,Jadore Dior
59307,"I’m probably biased because I wore this to my wedding, but I love that one."
59308,Tainted Love by TokyoMilk. I think it smells luxurious and musky and it's my favorite perfume; it definitely gets the most compliments and questions because it's not popular enough to be easily recognizable. I usually don't wear it much in the summer though since I go for something light and herbal in the hot weather. I'm excited to start wearing it again!
59309,Tainted Love and Bulletproof are my go-tos. The whole Dark line is just perfect!
59310,I have Dead Sexy and love it!   Good for all seasons and it lasts all day long.
59311,"Such an amazing fragrance, I am obsessed with it and I need to buy 12 more. Thanks for reminder!

What do you pick for summer weather?"
59312,Britney spears fantasy
59313,I've lost count of the number of times someone has complimented it on me. Even a male lecturer who walked past me during class recognised it. He said it's so distinct he thinks there's a tiny part of her in each bottle lol.
59314,I still get so many compliments on this one too!
59315,"I feel like a 14 year old girl wearing it because it's so overwhelmingly sweet but I love it so much 

All my sprays and perfumes are embarrassingly sweet-smelling"
59316,"Most of the Britney Spears' perfumes smell great, and it amazes me that I can buy high end perfumes, but inevitably the one that gets a compliment is a Britney fragrance. The Midnight and Circus version of Fantasy are especially great. I wear Midnight a lot in the colder weather and switch to Circus when it gets warmer."
59317,this is all i’ve ever worn and all i’ll ever wear.
59318,I wear this too! People compliment on it too and honestly it surprised me at first on how well it smelled because I didn’t expect to smell so nice
59319,"Yes! 

I first smelled it on a waitress I was working with over 10 years ago and was so surprised when she said what it was. Its been my go-to ever since! 

I get compliments every time I wear it!"
59320,"im not a fan of ariana grande, but her cloud perfume smells like sweet heaven to me. most times when i go out, someone will ask me what im wearing and i always get a little embarrassed to tell them its from ariana grande"
59321,"Yes! I just bought this because it’s so nice and it wears for a while on me too. If you ever want to find other perfumes that are similar, look up what her favorite perfumes are. Most of the perfumes in her collection are definitely inspired by higher end products with similar notes."
59322,"Mine is Sweet like candy from her, at 27 I feel too old to wear it but it smells like paradise."
59323,La vie est belle by Lancome is incredible and lasts all day!
59324,Gucci bamboo & Chanel chance
59325,Yes I love Chanel Chance!
59326,"Me too! It’s the only perfume I own, I tried it in Harrods on a vacation with my husband and he later bought it for me for that Christmas. It’s so lovely!"
59327,Read through the comments just to look for Gucci Bamboo. I think it’s lesser known than some other perfumes but always highly complimented!
59328,"my husband loves when i wear juliette has a gun midnight aud, but i can't get any more here in nz. even though the new sephora in auckland has heaps of their other scents :("
59329,I’m happy to buy it here in the US and ship it to you if you wanted.
59330,"that's an incredibly generous offer, thank you! we're just walking in to IT2, so I'll dm you tomorrow! ta!"
59331,"Check adore beauty online. They stock Juliet has a gun and might ship to NZ. If they don't, I'm in Australia and willing to ship on to you!"
59332,Victoria's Secret Bombshell
59333,Yes! Everyone knew I’d been in the bathroom in high school because of this perfume. Lol
59335,Clinique Happy!
59336,My first girlfriend in high school wore it. Going on 20 years later if I smell it I turn completely dumb. Spray it on a dead raccoon and ill ask it out.
59337,Ahaha. Thank you for the early morning laugh!
59338,Mon Paris YSL
59339,When I used to wear Lust from Lush people commented on it constantly
59340,I wear Rose Jam from Lush and it's amazing. Their body spray products are gorgeous and stay on you for the whole day after a few sprays.
59341,I wear Vanillary and people seem to like it a lot!
59342,I don’t think I’ve ever really been complimented by men for perfume but women always love Alien by Thierry Mugluer. It is by far THE longest lasting perfume I’ve ever worn and gets better as time goes on. Definitely not office appropriate as it is really strong but it’s so good!
59343,"I used to work at a fragrance counter where we would refill Star and Alien bottles.  We used to do anything to get out of having to do it.  When you do the refil you invariably spill a bit and the smell goes everywhere.  That stuff is so strong and lasts forever!  

I know folks love it - but if I never smell it again I will not feel like I have missed anything."
59344,"Viva la juicy by juicy couture, 
Tresor in Love by Lancôme, 
Sweet like candy by Ariana grande, 
and Tease Rebel by Victoria’s Secret"
59345,I get comments on Viva La Juicy too! At first I worried it was too sweet when I smelled it right out of the bottle but it must just work well on my skin
59346,i don’t wear perfume but my most-complimented lotion/scent is a thousand wishes from bath and body works
59347,you by glossier
59348,Narciso Rodriguez in the black bottle or Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle
59349,Nomade by Chloe. It was the perfume I wore on my wedding day and whenever I wear it my husband says it makes him really happy
59350,"Elizabeth and James Nirvana Amethyst. I only wear it for sexier times or when I’m looking to flirt. People always tell me it smells like sex. It pulls really... I don’t even know. It smells musky and smoky and like jasmine to me. But with a sweet undertone. 


Day to day I don’t wear perfume (healthcare job) but on days off I really like to wear Lancôme La Vie Est Belle. I always get comments on that one too."
59351,A discontinued one called poppy blossom by coach. So sad I can’t get it anymore
59352,I’m with you. I absolutely loved it.
59353,Omg yes.  The poppy varieties were better than the original!
59354,"Avon Far Away. I literally get it for like ten bucks but every time I wear it people stop me to ask em what I’m wearing. I’ve worn more expensive ones and more well known ones, but something about this and my body chemistry just works."
59355,I wore Surreal by Avon on my first date with my husband and to this day I wear it on our anniversary and he says he always gets vivid memories of the night. Thanks Avon!
59356,"Si by Giorgio Armani 

I was told by my mom that i should have a signature scent and after using this one, I never looked back. My roommates and friends all steal a spritz every so often and my boyfriend absolutely loves the smell"
59358,This stuff smells like sex in a bottle and I love it.
59359,Lust from Lush
59360,Alien by Thierry Mugler. Men especially seem to love it!
59361,Versace Bright Crystal Absolu
59362,"Vera Wang Princess.

I used to wear it all the time in high school. Took it out of retirement lately as I had a fresh bottle in my drawer and once again, lots of compliments.

Which makes me sad bc my expensive ones don’t get noticed often 😂"
59363,"Dolce Gabanna Light Blue 🤩  

It smells like citrus and the sea"
59364,"Maybe not complimented, but most commented on - Jean Nate:

""Why do you smell like my grandmother?"""
59365,Ralph by Ralph Lauren
59366,"Jo Malone Velvet Rose & Oud. I actually smelled it on a colleague, and it’s been my go to ever since. Fortunately she’s more of a Black Opium girl, so we’re not overpowering the office."
59367,Elizabeth and James Nirvana Bourbon
59368,Karma by Lush! Such a great scent!
59369,"It's called Fantasy and I am 100% sure it's like 40 years old and you can barely read the label anymore. I have been asked ""can I sniff you"" and then been told, ""smells like unicorn to me"". However, I have also been told that I smell like rancid waffles which I didn't even know was a thing. So, in conclusion, it's a 50/50 success rate."
59370,Definitely Chanel’s Chance Eau Tendre or Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle hands down. I’ve had women follow me to ask me what I’m wearing lol
59371,"Issey Miyake and Velvet Rope. 

I think Velvet Rope is a nice fall perfume."
59372,"L'eau de Issey

Coco mademoiselle"
59373,"Day: Jo Malone - Peony and Blush Suede.  
Night: YSL - Black Opium.

I've also had a lot of compliments years ago with a cologne Salvador Dali by Salvador Dali. It... is very commanding and mysterious."
59374,"I can’t stand the scent on me, but received the most compliments whenever I wear this perfume - Olympea Legend by Paco Rabbane."
59375,That Bath and Body Works Sweet Pea never failed me in middle school.
59376,Chanel no. 5 :)

- Daisy by Marc Jacobs

- Not A Perfume by Juliette Has a Gun

- Chloe by Chloe

59378,"Kinda irrelevant but Flower by Kenzo is the perfume I will forever associate with high class working women who GET SHIT DONE

My aunt used to wear this and she was a mum who juggled two jobs, and I still think her the peak of femininity. 
I wear it too, and it just makes me feel successful and powerful- thanks Kenzo!"
59379,J’adore by Dior. Still my favorite perfume of all time
59380,Wonderstruck by Taylor Swift
59381,"This thread gave me hella deja by and tripped me the fuck out.  Most complimented perfume was Victoria secrets bronzed coconut. I think it was cuz I use coconut shampoo and lotion and all that too so it was a combined scent. 
Warm sugar vanilla from bath and body works is my personal fav"
59382,Si by Armani! I actually don’t like it that much (it’s very sweet) but I have to finish the bottle. I always get complimented and it lasts all day!
59383,"Hypnotic Poison by Dior.

It's been my signature since high school and I have always gotten a ton of compliments on it. One of my coworkers said she can tell when I'm in the building because there's ""just a hint of deliciousness"". I'm definitely not opposed to being known for smelling nice!"
59384,It's a body mist. Bath and Body Works pumpkin one
59385,"Eau My by George Takei or Invictus by Paco Rabanne.

59391,Not technically perfume but I always get compliments whenever I use batiste dry shampoo.
59392,Lancome - La vie est belle
59393,Clinique Happy
59394,"straight up lemongrass essential oil! like 6 bucks for a pretty big thing of it from whole foods, and people lose their minds!"
59395,My husband absolutely loves Bombshell in Bloom from Victoria Secret on me. I can't find it anywhere and the bottle he gifted my was stolen with my purse after my car was broken into during a 12 hour shift. I'd give anything to see the smile he would get when he'd smell it on me.
59396,"Victoria's Secret Bombshells In Bloom By Victorias Secret for Women - 3.4 Oz Edp Spray, 3.4 Oz https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LPGW2RM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_xRzKDb1NEHD0J"
