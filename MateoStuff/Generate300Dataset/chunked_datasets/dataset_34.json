11026,"I used mine for the last two years of college and it was great. Comfortable straps, nice padded felt-lined laptop slot, durable and stylish."
11027,"I got one since I also didn't like the common sport style bags like op. Now I use it for everything, day trips, even groceries and it's pretty durable."
11028,Why aren't you using the marpat bag from DLI? Or did only graduates receive that?
11029,Wouldn't recommend because of one thing: the back material is crazy rough and mine ruined a lot of my shirts last summer by making the lower back area pill like crazy.
11031,"The shirts that the backpack destroyed were from APC, cdg play, Marimekko and cos. I guess it just depends on how sweaty your back is."
11032,Chrome bags are great and have a lifetime warranty
11033,Yeah I have a Chrome Rostov bag and I love it. No issues and I've been using it heavily lately.
11034,I definitely second this brand a lot. Chrome bags are amazing. Also I have had mine for almost 12 years now and still going strong.
11035,"Dakine. I've been using mine for over 5 years with ZERO problems.

That's is, if you can find one that fits the style youre looking for."
11036,"I've had mine since 2008, these bags are near indestructible.

Plus if it breaks, there's a lifetime warranty."
11037,"Their warranty service is really good.  After breaking a zipper, they just made me send them photos of the damage and then take a photo after cutting a hole in the bottom of the bag.  Replacement came a few days later in the mail."
11038,I got my LL Bean messenger bag in college and it's still going strong 10 years later
11039,"TL;DR - Buy the eBags Professional Slim

My friend, have I got a recommendation for you. I've actually been wanting desperately to find someone looking for a backpack recommendation since I got it and your post just triggered me so I apologize for being overzealous.

The backpack I currently own and swear-by is the eBags Professional Slim. It runs for about $100 which is by far the most I've ever paid for a backpack but I don't regret it at all. It has a padded compartment which I use to carry my laptop. I study Computer Science so I often need to take my laptop with me places so having a dedicated pocket for it makes my life a lot easier. I take notes on my ipad so the lined tablet sleeve is also a major key for me. The quality of the material is superb and the zippers don't look like they'll ever give me trouble.

Sorry I rambled a bit there. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxw6JdUeFX4) a link to a youtube video that really goes through all the features of the bag and please feel free to ask me any real-world-use questions."
11040,I use an Everlane Snap Backpack. Has held up very well.
11041,Mine is starting to show serious signs of wear only a year in. Don't listen OP. It's like the H&M of backpacks
11042,I was also looking to buy one but was turned off by negative reviews on their construction (all their bags seemed to fall apart around the end of the first year for the most part).
11043,"Weird, I've used mine heavily for 1.5 years, now, and it's still going strong."
11044,I've had the same experience. Mine's going on 2.5 years of frequent use and still looks and feels great.
11045,"Everlane or Jansport? I have a 2 year everlane and I think I'm going to replace it since it's showing so much signs of wear. However I think it's still going fine.

Do you have other suggestions?"
11046,"My fjalraven large rucksack has kept me good for 4 years. Been with me all through college.
It's also my daypack when I go backpacking or camping. It's my backpack for all short hikes too. 
It's my climbing, commuting, and grocery shopping backpack.

Held up well and aged beautifully. $200 is cheap for such durability.
Only thing is when I got hit by a car biking I landed partially on my backpack and it got one small hole and the schlep of the right side came apart a bit. Despite that being a year ago it still holds up fine and stays strong even with lots of weight in it. When I go grocery shopping I might be lugging close to 25lbs home after along day of classes too."
11048,"I live in Oregon.
Lots of people have the small one that's a little square with the logo in red and white. That's pretty much everywhere from Asia to Europe to America.

I have the big one. In my campus I've never seen someone with the same color, though I've seen two others with the same backpack. So I don't think mines basic or that common or over rated. Like I said, I've put it through the ringer. And it keeps my stuff dry even though it pours all the time here."
11049,"Sandqvist back packs. It's a Swedish brand with nice looking bags, similar to Herschel in the design but with a higher quality."
11050,Herschel.
11051,"Herschel Pop Quiz does me well. Except there are three people in one of my classes who have the exact same color and style as me, so keep it in mind I suppose."
11052,"I've had a north face since 2004, still in great shape.  Was like a hundred bucks or so."
11053,"I'm really happy with my Arc'teryx Arro 22, it's a really versatile and tough bag. Honestly it might be a bit overbuilt for your use (it kind of is for me - I don't need a hip belt or for it to be able to fit a hydration system), but I travel a lot for work and it's amazing for that. 

My only complaint is that I wish it had an actual sleeve for a laptop."
11054,Fjallraven Raven is working pretty well for me.
11055,"I've used a Mountain Hardwear 28L Agama backpack (also a great pack) for 7 years and it recently kicked the bucket on me midway through law school. I used it for school as well as camping, hiking, and traveling. I just got a Gregory pack and I love it even more than my Mountain Hardwear one. I'll attach a link to it. It's a top loader, which is great because I can stack things in it easier than a zip pack. It's also super water resistant, which is awesome (and what sold me) because it rains a ton where I live and I walk to school. In fact, I carried all my books, notebooks, and laptop in a torrential downpour this morning and everything stayed totally dry. The pack just sheds off water. Check it out man. Backpacks are something that can make your life way easier or they can just carry stuff. Knowing what you're looking for is the key to getting 5+ years of useful life out of one.

11057,Not a college student but I did a ton of research and picked up a Patagonia backpack. It's a great brand worthy of a mention here.
11058,"Didn't see these recommended yet, so:

Booq:  Their stuff is incredibly high quality.  I have a giant laptop (thick Alienware M17x) and it wouldn't fit in the Booq without forcing it so I returned the bag.  Can confirm that the materials and construction are top notch and they have some unique designs. 

Everki:  This is what I ended up with (the Beacon).  It's a lot softer than the Booq, but it's built like a tank.  I've taken that thing on countless flights, hikes, walks in the rain, etc. and not a single split seam, broken zipper/pull, torn material.  

I preferred the look and function of the Booq, but they're both built incredibly well."
11059,"Can recommend Fjallräven Kånken. If you have to carry laptop, they have a version for that as well, with a great separate compartment for it. I've had it for 4 years and have zero complaints."
11060,"I have the Hatchet Backpack from Jansport, it looks good and has a lot of space and its not that expensive its 60 dollars. I've found it to be a great backpack, I use it for school and travel"
11061,"I use the Jansport Wanderer. It's like the Right Pack with the suede bottom, but it has a nice cloth water bottle pocket on the side. It also does pretty well in rainy weather as I've noticed."
11062,Mission Workshops Rambler
11063,"Ive had my northface recon backpack for almost 10 years now. Had it all through high school, college, and multiple hikes, its still in as good of shape as the day i bought it. The newer NF backpack designs dont look as cool in my opinion, but theyre built to amazing quality and durability. Couldnt recommend it enough."
11064,"I enjoy [Tumi](http://www.tumi.com/s/backpack) backpacks if you dont have a budget. 

Spacious, many pockets, fashionable, durable. My friend and I have Alpha Bravo type backpacks"
11065,I have a Patagonia plqvk chupacabra (not actually that but close) and it is really nice and looks good in black.
11066,I bought an awesome backpack from Eddie Bauer when I started high school. 3rd year of college and it's still going strong.
11067,I've been using an Everlane Modern Zip (small) and it's great if you have a minimal aesthetic. Not recommended for computers though unless you have a nice laptop sleeve in addition.
11068,Ogio makes really nice backpacks with so much hidden storage and they are really nice quality.
11070,"I used to use an Everlane snap backpack, but I recently picked up two bags. One is a Tumi Luke Roll Top Bag, and the other was the Aer duffel pack. The Aer one is a combo gym and school bag and has compartments for everything (like I can fit a pair of shoes, gym clothes, laptop, notebooks, waterbottles, etc. at the same time), and the Tumi one is my everyday school bag. Tumi also has a great warranty policy for their bag, if you're concerned about wearing it out. Personally, I recommend the Aer bag. It's fucking dope, and has insane storage space."
11071,"I've been using a Topo Designs Klettersack for around a year, I absolutely adore it."

Looks nice, cheap (like 30 bucks), TONS of hidden compartments and space, fit a 15.6 inches laptop, and unbelievably durable, especially considering that I travel practically everywhere with it and abuse it terribly. Honestly I would recommend this."

11083,"What do you wear? Do you use your bag for anything other than laptop/books? How much do you usually carry? How much do you want to spend? So on. Without more info the suggestions are all over the place. That being said, here's my two cents:

Super cheap: look around a few thrift stores and see what you can pick up. I've found a great duffle and a great backpack this way, both for less than $10. Also maybe check out Army/Navy surplus stores if you have any in your area. If you put in the time you can find a great, sturdy bag from a thrift or army surplus store that wil outlast any similiarly priced item from walmart or target.

Mid range: L.L. Bean and Jansport both have some basic, versatile backpacks in the $30-$60 range, and they both have a pretty broad lifetime warranty. Herschel Supply Co also has some good looking bags, but they're warranty is a little more limited."
11084,"osprey is fiyah right now in the REI circles.

If you don't want the REI look then just go with something canvas like Everlane. But I think the point of a backpack is to carry stuff so it's worth to get more technical brands."
11085,"I've had my Patagonia Paxat for almost a year now and it's still going strong after biking to work everyday over the summer and 2 weeks in Israel carrying my shit while we hiked countless mountains and went to numerous beaches. 

I'm a student in college so I also use it for school and it's awesome! This is also one of the bigger backpacks you can buy so there's room for all your shit. It's also water resistant which is an incredibly nice feature. I had a jansport and whenever it poured some of my notebooks would get wet."
11086,dude any back pack works.  its just to carry your books around. stop clowning.
11087,"Jansport has a lifetime warrenty, as long as you pay shipping."
11088,"I recently happened across a pendleton land of the buffalo pack and am positively in love with it, if you want the opposite of sporty looking, pendleton might be worth a look."
11089,"Backpacks aren't something I'd worry about the fashion over, I think messenger bags work well for the typical college student. I got one from Serbags for like $70 awhile back and it's been a great little thing to have, I never realized how nice it is to be able to access it without taking it off. 

Just travel light, wears on the shoulders more."

11091,Louis Vuitton
11092,"Buy It For *Life?*

How many classes do you expect to fail?"
11093,"I'm still using my Jansport pack after 15 years. Got it in middle school, and after giving up on college it became my outdoors pack. I tore off the logo a long time ago and picked up a stain from somewhere, but the rest of the pack is pretty much perfect. It's become my every day carry bag for the last year.

You can use 'em for more than just school, ya know."
11094,"I've had my Jansport for 15 years or so as well.  The zippers died several times, and I'd just mail it back and they repaired it.  Eventually the seams started unraveling, and I sent it back and they mailed me a brand new one."
11095,"That's excellent.

A bag with a warrantee on zippers and seams is definitely worth looking for."
11096,My Jansport finally died of old age a few weeks ago.  I bought it in high school...in the 1990s.
11097,"You can send it to the company with a nice note; they'll probably either repair or replace it. It will cost you the cost of shipping it to them (in the US.)

Mine had some rips, one area it had worn through the fabric, and was generally a (still beloved) mess. They replaced the straps, patched the worn area, replaced the long-since torn mesh with a more durable cloth, and cleaned it. It's beautiful again!"
11098,I'd have to say jansport as well...I'm pretty sure they have a lifetime warranty too.
11099,I've gone through 3 or 4 of them. I think it just depends on how much you ask of them.
11100,"What are you doing with them? I thought I was pretty hard on mine in High School. I used to walk about 1/4 mile down the road where the bus dropped me off and sometimes I'd just kick the bag most of the way. Sometimes I'd throw it into the air just for the satisfying way it hit the ground. These days it mostly just gets overstuffed and tossed into my car or dropped onto rocks from a couple feet up, nothing serious. Now I'm curious as to what else I can get away with."
11101,"Mostly I'd pack it to bursting with textbooks. The zippers would give before the fabric did, but the fabric was on its way, too. 

I never knew that I could return them for a free replacement, but I probably would still have bought new ones because I couldn't afford to wait around for a new backpack while still needing to go to class. 

I bought a Red Oxx C-Ruck last year and don't see myself ever buying a new backpack ever again. It even fits my 17"" laptop with ease and the only way I've ever heard anyone's managed to damage one is dragging it behind a car for a mile, resulting in a bit of fraying that was still replaced for free."
11102,Gotta second this. Mine's still holding up after 13 years.
11103,"I also went with Jansports in middle school and high school (about 10-12 years ago) and the first one was great for a long time but then it was stolen.  

Going on my good experience and the company's good reputation I bought another one.  It broke in less than a year.  ""It must have been a fluke,"" I thought.  My first bag was so good.  I had two more flukes after that until I finally realized that my first good experience must have been the fluke.  

Their main problem was the zippers getting caught on unraveled threads.  

tl;dr- Had four Jansports 10-12 years ago.  First one was great until it was stolen.  The rest were lemons."
11104,"But, they fix them for free, for ever!  Plus, I have had mine since 5 th grade.  I'm 30 now."
11105,"4-5 years for undergrad then a few more for a masters, tack on your PhD and poof, you're in your mid 30's."
11106,"I've used a North Face Recon for about 8 or 9 years now, never had a problem with it. If you ever do, they'll fix it or replace it. Great bag, I highly recommend it."
11107,"Seconded. I've got a [North Face Surge](http://www.amazon.com/The-North-Face-Surge/dp/B000NAYDTG) that's going on 4 years now of undergrad and grad school. It's got plenty of life left in it, too. Well built, useful pockets, comfortable straps, water resistant, and carries a lot of weight in books."
11108,"Everybody is suggesting way to expensive options for a backpack which will sit on a piece of tile. Get a Jansport. Cheap, durable, lifetime warranty. Of course if you want to throw money on a style. Go ahead"
11109,"I hate to plug LL Bean, but it's the only book bag that's actually held up for me. My brother, sister and I all had multiple Eddie Bauer backpacks, but they didn't make it past a couple of years each. My messenger bags and other backpacks (Adidas, Swiss, and a couple others) all tore up in less than a year... I seriously went through 5 bags in two years before caving in and getting the LL Bean.

My sister and I now both have LL Bean backpacks that have been going strong for 7 or 8 years of VERY heavy use throughout high school, college, and grad school. For me, 5 of those years were spent carrying my MacBook, and there are no real signs of wear. My sister now carries her MBP in hers and it's holding up well, too. [This is the closest one to mine I could find](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/64781?feat=506219-GN2), but mine has a sturdier handle at the top."
11110,[L.L. Bean Guarantee is nice too.](http://www.llbean.com/customerService/aboutLLBean/guaranteed_popup.html)
11111,Why do you hate to plug LL Bean?
11112,"For silly reasons: they were a status symbol at my high school (specifically the monogrammed sort) and I became prejudiced against people that wore them.

More seriously: At the time I bought mine (high school student), I thought it was terribly expensive. Of course now $70 doesn't seem that bad, but I'm quite miserly."
11113,"Heh, my parents had the credit card, so mine was bought with reward-points (free shipping and monogramming too)."
11114,"Hmm, my Eddie Bauer experience was quite the opposite.  I bought it my Freshman year of college, used it throughout 5 year undergrad, traveled with it, used it for part of grad school until a shoulder injury put me in a messenger bag.  15 years later, the backpack's fine.  No split zippers, no tears, no problems.  Judging by your experience, maybe Eddie Bauer's quality has slipped."
11116,Maybe.  Mine *was* from one of their mall stores.
11117,"I agree, I've had my blue ll bean backpack for 7 years, and its held together. Mine is very similar the the picture you linked. Yes, it was also kind of a status symbol when kids got theirs monogrammed"
11118,"My EB experience is very different. In fact, I bought it after my cousin, a geologist/paleontologist recommended it after seeing it perform well for him over a few years at dig sites."
11119,"Hm, I have a Swiss one that's held up through a good number of camping trips in addition to normal use. I love it. It's a backpack + laptop case, and is great for college."
11120,Jansport backpacks are durable and have a lifetime warranty.
11121,"They have a lifetime warranty? I got mine in middle school about 15 years ago and I'm still waiting for the first rip. After school, I started using it for travel and outdoors adventures. Hell, I used to throw it up into the air just to watch it plop back down on the road after school."
11122,"You put a backpack through that abuse, you find it's still good and you are surprised they offer a lifetime warranty?"
11123,"I got it in middle school, before the economy did that thing. I didn't care about warranties back then. I never really thought about it until this thread; it was just some bag I had. 

Your comment got me thinking, ""what else do I own with a lifetime warranty?"""
11124,Bought mine at the beginning of college. 5 years later it is still in perfect condition and I travel with it constantly.
11125,"I highly recommend [Chrome Bags](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/).

They make super durable 1000D Cordura (the toughest nylon woven) and has a heavy truck tarp liner suspended independently from the outer shell for additional durability and waterproofing. You can get caught in a heavy downpour and everything inside will stay bone dry in a Chrome bag. All the serious wear points like the straps, etc, are double-stitched so you don't have to worry about anything tearing out.

I've been carrying [mine](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/messenger-bags/metropolis-buckle-bag---large.html) for three years now and it still looks and works great with no sign of wear. There are messengers riding around the city here with bags that are 10+ years old in excellent condition. For your needs, I might suggest considering a pack like the [Pawn](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs/pawn-rolltop-pack---medium.html), which is big, but not too big, has convenient external pockets, and is made in the USA.

E: I'd also recommend picking up a simple neoprene sleeve to add some padding protection to your MacBook.

For around $150 you get top-shelf design, high durability, heavy weather resistance, and a fantastic warranty. 

These are serious bags made to last."
11126,"This.  My Chrome messenger bag is practically indestructible.  $165, but I got the huge one (when I travel for less than about a week, it's the only bag I need), and I've definitely put it through some shit since I've had it.  As barry said, you'll need a sleeve for your laptop, but you're gonna be happy with it.  Plus the styling just looks great.  I've had mine for 3 years, and someone asked me last week if it was new - I'd definitely classify it as BIFL."
11127,"Going to go ahead and 3rd this recommendation. I bought mine 6 years ago and it still looks nearly like it did the day I got it, and I take it everywhere... It's an over the shoulder bike messenger bag, but they have plenty of [backpack](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs.html) models like barry_baltimore linked to.

I have never owned a better built, better looking, or more functionally complete bag for school in the 9 years I spent in Universities"
11128,"Or Mission Workshop, which was started by the Chrome founders after they sold the company.

It's like Chrome, but even better.

Goruck makes some very nice packs as well."
11129,"Could you take a minute to point out specifics what makes Mission Workshop better than Chrome? I've heard this sentiment a lot, but I haven't had the opportunity to see MW in person to compare."
11130,"I'm not sure, but how could you not want one after seeing this picture? http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/197486_10150112664699983_3585644_n.jpg"

11132,I thought that was Bill Hader in the backpack.
11133,"from their videos, you can switch the strap orientation so you can switch shoulders, and it takes well under 2 minutes.  that's a feature i'd like to have."
11134,"Better workmanship, better materials, improved designs."
11135,"Thanks for the heads up, I'll check them out. I didn't know they had sold the company"
11136,Yep.   Chromes website has a popup as soon as it loads up.  This alone peeved me out so bad I refuse to look at their site.
11137,Any idea if these Chrome or MW bags would be small enough for a fairly short girl? I love the way they look!
11138,"definitely a swiss gear backpack like the one suggested by Aorian, I dont have the same one he's suggesting but I've had the same swiss gear backpack for over three years now, and it's still in really good condition and there's plenty of room for everything you'll need to carry."
11139,"My boyfriend has a swiss gear that I have used.  They don't seem to have any with waist straps which is a disadvantage.  Also, all of their backpacks are too big for me- they don't do packs for smaller-framed people.

Other than that, they are sturdy, dependable packs.  A zipper did break in our pack, but it took a couple of years."
11140,"Weird.  I have [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Maxxum-Swiss-Wenger-Notebook-Backpack/dp/B000BYVA8Q/ref=sr_1_13?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1342647538&sr=1-13&keywords=SwissGear+backpack) from college, and I was going to say, ""This one has waist straps,"" but it doesn't look like it does in the picture.  Mine definitely does.  They must have changed them.

It's a good backpack overall, but kind of annoying that it's so thick.  It doesn't do well on planes (lots of cramming under the seat), and I'm always smacking people with it if I turn around in any sort of crowd while wearing it.  It's really comfortable, though, and it hasn't fallen apart over the past 7 years."
11141,"I would advice against buying a backpack made specifically for a laptop. I have found out over the years, that pretty much every backpack nowadays has a separate pocket for something laptop sized anyways. Generally I would say ""non laptop"" backpacks look better and last longer. You can always fit in a sleeve or something if you want to protect your macbook. I don't have too much experience with any backpack that is currently in sale, but I have great experience with Boll, Mammut, Salomon and very good with Deuter.

Anyway, go to a local outdoor outlet and take a look. I'd say most of the time, it's pretty apparent what would make a great backpack. Ideally look for something easily repairable, sturdy, waterproof where it matters..."
11142,"[these sleeves](http://sfbags.com/) are pricey, but i bought mine for my last macbook, and it's currently in its 4th year and protecting a 3 year old mbp 13"".  incredible quality."
11143,"Oh, don't get me wrong, sleeves and bags for laptops are good, but op asked about backpacks. I have a Crumpler sleeve (Which is great) and some other brand laptop bag (Which I found to be way to heavy). Anyway, I actually prefer backpacks. You see, I work night shifts mostly in area that is pretty much Prague's center of criminality and night life. Now I am a pretty big guy and there are easier targets out there, but I still feel a little more comfortable having a backpack that doesn't scream I have a expensive as fu.. laptop in it. + I usually have to fit either massive amounts of books for college or a lot of other stuff whenever I go anywhere.

That said, sleeves you linked look great. Will look into it when I need one."

I've had it six years now and carry about 20 lbs in it on my daily commute.  It totally rocks, and comes with a lifetime guarantee."
11146,"A lifetime guarantee doesn't make something BIFL but it sweetens the pot! I too would agree with Timbuk2... I have 2 of their bags 1 Messenger bag (had it for 4 years and a stitch has not even thought about fraying). The other is a copilot roller bag for traveling... it has been through month in Europe, a week long US west coast trip and multiple weekend trips.. Long story short. THEY MAKE THE BEST BAGS IN THE WORLD!"
11147,"I like hiking-quality daypacks for college.  I am in engineering, so I have heavy books and walk all the way across campus.  Having an internal frame and waist straps is *immensely* beneficial in saving your back and making your load feel lighter.  

I know they are expensive, but I got mine at REI.  The benefit?  They have twice done major repair on it, for *free*.  It cost twice a normal backpack, but has lasted 5x as long and is more comfortable.  I used to kill a backpack or two a year- this one I had thru half undergraduate and all graduate school.

Now they have models that have laptop pouches.  In addition, the hydration packs are useful in that the water pouch can be filled with a laptop instead.  

Go to REI with a couple of text books and a laptop and see what works out.  I had a Gregory pack myself, but my particular model is not made now.  Get a backpack with at the minimum waist straps and prefereably in internal frame- your spine will thank you.  


I have heard the [chrome](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs.html) bags are really good workmanship/quality (albeit expensive) but I havent found a place I would try one on.  Fit is pretty important for me, and most male packs have chest straps that go right over the tits (not comfortable at all)."
11148,"Dell.  Buy a Dell laptop.  Get the free backpack.  Throw away the laptop.

I've had my Dell backpack since about 2001.  Last year I finally gave it to my dad who uses it every day to haul around his big-ass Sony laptop.

Now I use a backpack from whatever company has the Swiss Army logo.  I've been abusing it for about 3 years, with my work-issued Dell laptop when I'm at work.  And when I'm not, I take it hiking and biking (It holds maps, water, etc, really well).  On an average day it holds my 15bazillion pound laptop, accessories, and a bunch of extra stuff (small tools, paracord, etc) that I keep with me.  I throw it in the Jeep for the morning and evening commutes (no sides, no doors, so it gets a LOT of wind abuse).  No problems so far - not even a loose stitch."

Will it outlast you? No idea. Will it outlast you at least two laptops? Easy.  

Edit: maybe I've had it three years."
11150,"I concur. I've had this backpack since I think 2005. I've had it so long I can't remember when I bought it. It has held up through the last few years of undergrad and law school, as well as being my go to overnight bag. It still looks almost brand new."
11151,I was going to post this same bag.  I've had mine for going on 5 years now.  Still great.  That steel cable running through the handle is terrific.
11152,"I also concur. Had mine 3 years now, no real issues at all. It's got one loose thread on it, and it has survived a pretty bad bicycle accident where I slid on my side/back all the way across a street."

11156,"Jansport make the greatest small rucksack I have ever owned: the [Trinity](http://www.jansport.com/js_product_detail.php?cid=100&pid=TUJ0). It lasted through my last three years of secondary school, hauling serious book tonnage.  Then it got another three years of college, being scuffed off bus floors, getting filthy and going through the washing machine repeatedly. After six years of almost-daily use, the bag is still as solid as ever.  No structural failures; just a small hole in the back pocket where the pressure of keys caused some abrasion. That's practically cosmetic.  

Now, I'm not a person who is kind to my bags.  In the same time, after only occasional use, the internal frame on my 80l Vango rucksack has worn through the fabric.  After only one year of occasional use, my Deuter day bag has lost a zip and the buckle on the chest strap.  I'll probably replace them with Jansport stuff when I can afford to.

11157,"L.L. Bean. I've had mine for going on 9 years, barely any visible wear. And this after wearing out an EAS hiking daypack Freshman year. I've taken this backpack to three countries (soon to be 4), three colleges, and many many many hours of slogging around campuses and airports. With 9 years of hindsight I might not have picked orange or that style of monogram, but it has room for my 15"" macbook pro, is comfortable for long walks to various libraries, and can hold at least 4 days of clothes if I pack right for short trips.

Edit: [This one](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/64778?feat=816-CL1) is the closest to what mine looks like, although mine has more light-reflective bits on it."

11167,"This is what I've used for 3 years with a MBP on my back daily on the bike/mass transit to work.  The pack itself is meh, but it's kept my laptop well-protected.

Definitely not a BIFL, unless you count replacements from REI (or similar).  I had a zipper break about a year ago, so I'm on my second pack.  It doesn't feel any sturdier than the first, so I'd give it a couple years, tops.  If you're just looking to pay once, great, but if you're looking for craftsmanship you're probably not looking at anything North Face anyway.

Also, as a personal preference, the outside front pocket is shockingly useless.  Nothing stays in the loose compartments, and the zippers opening it cause all the small things you tend to keep there to shoot out in all directions."
11168,"My recommendation is a [Northface Vault](http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/ca_ecom/engear/vault-backpack_2.html)

I bought mine freshman year of college.  So far it has survived 4 years of college and 2 years of law school.  Especially in the last two years, I have put that poor backpack through more than it should be expected to handle, and it's holding up perfectly.

I wouldn't particularly recommend the roll-top design for just classes, but I use it as my beach bag and an overnight duffel at times.Back to the point, Timbuk2 has lifetime guarantees on all their gear. Their stuff is truly top-notch. Tough materials with serious stitching and practical design with tons of interior room. They seem to like to give you open space instead of a billion pockets that restrict where you can put stuff in your bag. A lot of their bags also have a 'stash pocket' or whatever they call it on the back for your well...stash, if you're into that sort of thing. Personally, I keep a couple emergency bucks in mine. Simply put, though, the quality is incredible.If you're interested, DON'T buy from their site. If you do, you're looking at well over $100 a bag. I bought my bag at Sierra Trading Post for about $50 thanks to the 20% coupons that are almost always available for them. They're sometimes previous-year styles, but hell, I've heard of people who are still using their 20 year old Timbuk2 bags so I figure one year should make no difference."

11230,"Textbooks you will basically never take to class. Either a laptop or notebook. Unless you plan to go back to your place between every class, you'll want some kind of bag so you don't have to hold it all the time.

Maybe for some reason I need a pencil instead of the pen I always use. Maybe there's an interesting bird and I want to take a picture. I've got my camera. Maybe my phone is running low and there are no seats near outlets - I've got my power-pack. Left my wallet on my desk? There's a spare $10 in there for lunch. Long break between classes? I've got a book. Power goes out? Flashlight. 

But the marginal value of all that is low, so... whatever floats your boat."

I forget the name of them, but surely some handy outdoors(wo)man can expand on my drunk thoughts."
11252,Sweet jesus.
11253,or just go to /r/HammockDistrict
11254,Maybe you can find them in the hammock district on third.
11255,"I call shenanigans on this.  you ABSOLUTELY NEED A PAD IN YOUR HAMMOCK UNDER YOUR BAG or you will FREEZE YOUR ASS OFF.  Even in a sleeping bag, you will crush all of the insulation beneath you and all that's left between you and the cold breeze is 3 tiny layers of nylon.  If its super warm and you dont really need a bag, ok, but if its even a little bit chilly, you WILL wake up in the middle of the night shivering.  First hand knowledge, spent 7 months on the road primarily sleeping in my Hennesy Hammock and Big Agnes bag with the integrated sleeping pad slot."
11256,"I don't know what to tell you. I was fine. I didn't know the cords and hooks were at an additional cost. I didn't ask my sister how much it cost when I borrowed it. I asked at the store at a later date. They apparently left them out. 

This happened  though. Trust me, I have better things to do than make up hammock stories. Maybe the temp on my phone was way off. Who knows."
11257,Oh god yes. I would love a hammock.
11258,"I asked my dad earlier, what do you want for fathers day, and he said, anything but a hammock. So no."
11260,Can never have enough socks....
11261,Every year...
11262,"“One can never have enough socks,"" said ~~Dumbledore~~ dads everywhere. ""Another ~~Christmas~~ Father's Day has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. ~~People~~ My kids will insist on ~~giving me books~~ giving me the same stuff they give to their mom with a different color.”"
11263,"As a father and a human, new socks are the best thing ever.  For every holiday and birthday, I ask for socks.  You cannot replace the feeling of putting on a pair of socks for the first time."
11264,It's like warm apple pie.
11265,"My grandpa always used to ask for socks.

When he died, it was a few months before Father's Day. I put a package of socks on his tombstone when Father's Day came."
11266,What about ties and underwear?
11267,My dad would ask for socks and underwear. His reasoning was that they were useful and he always forgot to buy them for himself. My dad was a pragmatic man.
11268,"""Just get me a card"""
11269,For the past 8 years my mother and I have been regifting the same card to my dad. *He's never noticed.*
11270,"my dad, every year ever."
11271,It even gets worse the older they get. Once the kids are grown up and supporting themselves they can just buy whatever the hell they want whenever they want. Stuff they don't even need.
11272,Not this dad. I am the easiest person to get a gift for. Mainly because I have several hobbies I'm quite adamant about.
11273,"biggest problem really is that most dads can buy the shit they want, especially anything that's in the price range of a child/college student.

Handmade is something that he can't buy, so always shows some real thought/effort made"
11275,Now that's just adorable.
11277,"This is how I try to do it. Daughter says ""daddy come look at this!"", I think about how tired I am and who fucking cares, then I think there is only one shot. The kids are growing up and need their daddy to look at something. I'll look at it. If only because Chris Rock said the goal is to keep your daughter off the pole. That is my main motivation."
11279,"You know what, this has just made me realise why I'm closer to my mum. My dad's great but he was never interested in the little things growing up. He'll forget my friends' names or if I tell him I have a party on the weekend etc. Mum always listens and remembers. When I get married, I'm going to ensure that my husband doesn't make the same mistake my dad made."
11280,"I keep a folder on my computer to the links that I want to re-read when I finally become a father.  This part of the thread has made me add this link.  

Thanks /u/gmrdd and the top repliers...."
11281,"This made me think of my dad. I would draw pictures for him and even if they looked like dog shit, he would say, ""that's great baby! Keep it up!""

Aaaaand now I'm crying tears of joy."
11282,Oh god.  My father had one of those dog shit drawings I made in school *framed and hanging in his bedroom* because I made it for him.  He won't take it down.
11283,"Can I give you one piece of unsolicited advice? Share your stories. Share them early and often. My whole life growing up my dad would tell me stories and I'd love them, but I would always say ""Dad, you've told me this one!""

He died when I was 16. I half remember some of his growing up stories. I wish I knew those stories better. I wish he had told the stories more often. I wish he had shut me up and repeated the stories.

Also, keep a journal if you can. You never know what might happen.

Dad used to hint at stories for ""When in was older"". I'm 30 now and I wish I knew stories about my father's drug use and his wild drinking tales. When I was a kid he didn't think they were age appropriate, and my mom wasn't around for most of them. I get why he didn't tell me those stories when I was twelve, but now I'm so curious. He had a big falling out with his brother and never kept in contact with his ""pre-marriage"" friends enough for me to contact them."
11284,You're a good father.
11285,Wait until each boy reaches puberty. That plaster cast from that year is going to be the real keeper.
11286,"Condoms, drug paraphernalia, acne medication bottles... Or maybe just CDs and stuff like that"
11287,">CDs

We're in 2013, man."
11288,"Dad, buy me a new iPod, I stuck mine on this stupid plaster mold and now it's stuck."
11289,"Every year, I make my dad a huge sandwich that he never finishes. Last year, it was a Mongolian beef party sub."
11290,How big is the sandwich? o.o
11291,"Thiiiiiiiiiiiis


|___________________________|


Big"
11292,> ^Not ^to ^scale
11293,"I dunno, I zoomed in really close. It was pretty big."
11294,It is to scale. He is a borrower.
11295,μm?
11296,"It's usually a party sub. This year I""m just going for tall."
11297,Dagwood sandwich!
11298,"A couple of years ago, my daughter got me a Kindle.  It was the best gift ever.

Of course, she was two, and didn't have any money, but if she'd known how much I wanted it she would have gladly bought it with my money.  Instead, I had to buy it myself and then give it to myself from her.  Come to think of it, she may not have ever seen the box.  Kindles rock."
11299,"Not sure if corporate shill or just satisfied customer. Hard to tell, but I'm leaning happy user since you didn't post any Amazon affiliate links."
11300,"I created the account over a year ago in a genius plan to shill for Amazon.  They paid me to reddit for a year just to build up my creds, not gonna lie."
11301,I could tell from your username you're an avid reader and possibly even dabbled in writing.
11302,"Heh, yep.  Have written a couple of novels in the last year, and more short stories than I can count."
11303,That's awesome. I've written one short story. (That has gotten to a final copy)Its terrible and was put online by some start up website. I've tried to get back into it but i just haven't had the drive lately. Life is a serious punch in the sack sometimes..
11304,"Kindles just make you that happy.

Source: Kindle owner."
11305,"This year, Father's Day falls on a weekend that I'm not scheduled to have my kids. I just want her to agree to let me have them on Father's Day, even if it's only for the morning. That's all I want."
11306,"I'm letting my daughter stay with her dad. I grew up without having my dad in my household so I know how important it is for a father to be in their child's life. My daughter wasn't just my blessing, she was his blessing as well. And who am I to take that away from him? Plus he is a great dad!"
11307,"That's exactly how I would hope a divorced parent would feel about their former partner when there are kids involved. 

Kudos to you for being a decent human being."
11308,I like that you're so decent. It's really refreshing to see amongst divorced people.
11309,My divorced parents are actually fairly good friends. They just... Don't get along for extended periods.
11310,"As a child of divorce, thank you. Your daughter may not appreciate your efforts yet, but she will someday."
11311,"As a child of divorce, whenever I hear these sorts of things, my instinct is to ask why the parents separated?"
11312,"I'm not divorced but I know several divorcees, and sometimes two people just can't mesh, no matter which way you try. Two people can be civil with each other, even friendly, but put them in the same living space and shit gets volatile. It's better for the kids to end the marriage and raise the kids as friends than try to ""stick it out"" for the kids' sake and let them watch a disastrous relationship evolve over the years, setting them up for the same pattern in their own adult lives. 

Incidentally, you can see this happen quite commonly among young college students. They make friends, decide to rent an apartment together, and in one year you have two (or more) people who can't stand to live with each other any more."
11313,I agree with your sentiment entirely. Especially about divorcing for the kids' sake.
11314,"Because being a good father, and a good husband, are two different things."
11315,"Also, being a good husband to one person doesn't mean you're going to be a good husband to everyone."
11316,"Perhaps the two of you can make a deal so she always gets the kids on Mother's Day--even if it's not her weekend--and you always get them on Father's Day, even if it's not your weekend."
11317,"It was my weekend for Mother's Day this year and I made sure the kids were with her. They should be with her. I shouldn't be. On *any* day. But they should, so they were. I definitely didn't do it for her, I'll be honest. I'm just hoping she sees that they should be with me on Father's Day."
11318,"Thats rough man, hopefully she decides to be a decent human being and let you see them."
11319,"Thanks, man. I really hope so."
11320,"The first Father's Day after I left my ex, she kept my son because it was the weekend of her birthday. She felt it was more appropriate to take a 3 year old to party in Miami, than for him to see his dad on Father's Day. I sat in church, crying as I listened to all the other children sing about how much they loved their daddies. So yeah, I feel you. Just remember you don't need a holiday to know how much your kids love you. Still, I hope you get to see them. Hug the shit out of them if you do."
11321,"Fuck. Fuck, man, I'm sorry. I hope you've seen him every year since them. That's making me tear up reading that."
11322,":( I didn't realize you were divorced. 

What are your kids like?"
11323,They're awesome. They're silly and funny and loud and curious and humbling and awesome.
11324,Signed in so I could upvote. It took 17 years but my son finally moved in with me. Keep the faith.
11325,My aunt and her daughter's father alternate custody on weekends but she gets her mother's day no matter what and he gets her father's day no matter what. Decency goes a long way.
11326,"Seriously, for me that's a given he gets the kids. Apparently I'm not all crazy."
11327,"A couple years ago I received a rock from my sons with letters glued on. It said ""Our Dad Rocks.""

It sits right under my computer screen and if I'm having a rough day, I just look down and I feel good again."
11328,"This is just my view on gifts in general:

Get me something I will USE. It doesn't have to be expensive. I have in my pocket a Winchester pocket knife that has ""Dad"" etched on the blade it cost maybe ten bucks. But damn if I don't think aboht how it got to be in my possession every time I pick it up.

Get an item for a hobby, or for work. You know him better than us."
11329,"In East of Eden, Charles gives his father an expensive pocket knife for his birthday. Adam gives him a puppy. The puppy is met with greater favor from the boys' father, prompting Charles to go berserk and beat the shit out of Adam. Charles's love for his father is forever unrequited. OP would probably be fine giving his dad a knife if he was certain that none of his siblings has a better gift lined up."
11330,I got this confused with Exit to Eden and had a very weird sidetrack featuring Rosie O'Donnel and Dan Akroyd in fetish gear shopping for Father's Day gifts.
11331,"My husband asked for a wallet for Father's Day. I'm going to let my 3 year old pick it out. It's going to be hilarious, I suspect. 

...I'll save the receipt."
11332,Dad wants a Dora the Explorer wallet.
11333,"Those are the best, 'cause if someone tribes to take it, you just say ""Swiper, no swiping"" three times and they have to leave you alone, after replying ""Awww maaaaannnn""."
11334,"Every man wants a pink wallet, maybe a dumb elephant will be on it?  
Endless opportunities, I say."
11335,"That is so awesome. If my 3yr old would get me a Dinosaur or Spongebob or whatever wallet, I would proudly use the shit out of it until he/she is old enough to be  properly embarrassed of it."
11336,"Time.  All I want is my daughter's time.  Right now, she's only 3 years old, so it's pretty easy.  We can spend the day together.  That's the tradition I hope to start.  I know it'll be harder for her as she get's older and goes her own way, so I'll make as many memories as I can while we can.  Physical stuff doesn't matter to me, memories do."
11337,"I want a round of golf paid for and a little spending cash. Then, after 18 holes, I'd come home, grill some steaks, and play a little wii bowling with the family while I sip a few craft beers. Damn, I'm excited now."
11338,"TIL dads really do like ""dad stuff""."
11339,Take out the papers and trash or you won't get NO spending cash.
11340,"Don't talk back, TreyviusAurelius."
