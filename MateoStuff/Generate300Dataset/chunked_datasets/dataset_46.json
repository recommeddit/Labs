14785,"I really enjoy novels written by Devney Perry, Melanie Harlow, Vi Keeland, or RS Grey.  I find them to all be really solid writers and it‚Äôs not often that I read one of their novels and get distracted by crappy dialogue, unbelievable plot, errors, etc.  I really can‚Äôt pick a particular novel by any of them because I think they‚Äôre all great!  They also publish pretty frequently; Perry and Harlow write novels in series mainly.

If I had to pick one novel that was really well written it would be Beach Read by Emily Henry."
14786,Emily Henry's new novel is even better than Beach Read!
14787,Are you referring to People We Meet on Vacation?
14788,Yes! It is magnificent.
14789,"I cannot wait!  I‚Äôm assuming you received an ARC, and I couldn‚Äôt be more envious.  Beach Read was truly one of my favorite books in the last decade, and Emily Henry is just a DELIGHT on Instagram."
14790,"I enjoyed Beach Read but did understand why it missed people's expectations, but PWMOV is like...just a really solid romance & so well-written. You will adore it."
14791,Omg yes RS Grey! The way she writes just makes me never want to put the book down. Her writing style is so addicting.
14792,She has a new one coming out next week!  I think the title is To Have and to Hate.
14793,"Oh, I love this question! I like Clair Kingsley, Lucy Score, Melanie Moreland, Ruth Cardello, Melanie Harlow (not as great as the rest imo, but I have enjoyed some of her books), and Katie Ruggle and Pamela Clare. The last two are romantic suspense, and the remainder are  contemporary (for the most part). I'm sure there are more, I had a list on my old phone, but it didn't transfer over to the new one."
14794,Pansies by Alexis Hall
14795,Seize the Fire by Laura Kinsale And Black Silk by Judith Ivory
14796,What is this Black Silk book you speak of and why haven‚Äôt I heard of it before?? I can‚Äôt find it under her Goodreads page. üò±
14797,"Sorry, Black Silk was Judith Ivory!"
14798,"Ahaha no problem! I got all excited because I thought there was another LK book out there that I didn‚Äôt know about. 

I will definitely still check it out though since it sounds interesting! üëç"
14799,I just finished Seize the Fire this morning. Loved it. Have you read other books of hers?
14800,Yes! Flowers in the storm is a favorite of a lot of people. Also her medieval series is excellent.
14801,"Oh my god Black Silk! I once saw a goodreads review that describes Ivory's writing having ""a sort of literary 'fat'"" and it was such an accurate description. Her writing is just **rich**. I still vividly remember scenes, characters, I feel like I was actually there? And I read this book three years ago. The scene where they're sitting in the grass, and her black dress and the top of her head are hot from the summer sun - it's like I can smell it, it's crazy."
14802,It's soooo good.
14803,"The Dream Hunter is my favorite Kinsale book. It‚Äôs rarely mentioned when ppl talk about her works but it‚Äôs in my top 5. The world she built, the H‚Äôs innermost thoughts and vulnerability, the  ability to describe love and the falling into it btwn the h/H simply beautiful.

Ivory has the same magical touch with words and while I admired the beauty of Black Silk it‚Äôs not one I want to reread over and over. She wrote Bliss and Dance under her pseudonym Judy Cuevas, both are high quality and lush."
14804,"I keep putting off Dream Hunter because then there won't be anymore after! üò≠

I still have quite a few Judith Ivory to get to as well, so thank you for the rec!"
14805,I‚Äôm obsessed with the writing style of Casey McQuiston. Someone said her writing reads like poetry and I couldn‚Äôt agree more... Red White and Royal Blue was an absolute masterpiece imo. She‚Äôs a fantastic writer
14806,I'm so hopeful that One Last Stop proves to be another hit!
14807,"Yes, there were moments in Red, White and Royal Blue when I just had to stop and admire the way she used words. I love romance but honestly, that rarely happens, even with my favorite writers. It happened multiple times in that book."
14808,"Some of my favorites are:

{The Hating Game by Sally Thorne}

{Happiness for Beginners by Katherine Center}

{The Friend Zone by Abby Jimenez}

{Archer‚Äôs Voice by Mia Sheridan}"
14809,Archer‚Äôs Voice ü•∞ I love that book!
14810,Can‚Äôt wait to see The Hating Game movie! Hope it‚Äôs good!

14812,Lover eternal by J R ward. Something about Rhage and Mary's love was so raw and emotional!! It was beautiful.
14813,"{The bird and the sword by Amy Harmon} is BEAUTIFUUUULLLLL. It‚Äôs one of those books that I appreciate its prose either as much or more than the story itself. Like you, sometimes I get on a spate of amateur novels and this was an excellent palate cleanser.

14817,Homebound was so good!!! Loved Simon and can‚Äôt wait to see what the author writes next! Definitely one of my personal favorites as well.
14818,Sugar Daddy by Lisa Kleypas.  I just adore this story.
14819,"Sigh, yes. I still think about it and it‚Äôs been 3 months since I‚Äôve read it. The way she develops Liberty‚Äôs story... I felt like I knew her. Like really knew her. Her childhood scenes were so real."
14820,"Happy cake day!!

I first read it... 10, 12 years ago, and I reread every year or so.  It‚Äôs one of the few hardbacks I‚Äôve kept over the years!!

Edit - her whole childhood and taking care of her sister... I just really FELT that."

14822,Oh man I loved Silver Linings by Maggie Osborne! She has some great solid romances.
14823,"{{The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons}}

The first paragraph introducing the female MC has this beautiful imagery of white Leningrad nights and jasmine June and the intoxication from life that belongs to the young. 

I haven‚Äôt read the book in a few years, but this first image and many others (I won‚Äôt share them because spoilers) will forever be seared into my mind because of how achingly beautiful they are. 

It‚Äôs a trilogy, and all three books are huge, so you should have many days of indulgence ahead. Eventual HEA in book 3

Now, I‚Äôve seen some people write very long complaints about how the relationship (more importantly the mmc) is problematic, and tbh, by modern standards, maybe they are. 

But this is a historical novel, and very very realistic in terms of character development, so moral relativism is very important to keep in mind. (Consent, for example, is defined differently.) It‚Äôs definitely not a book written with modern sensibilities. 

I personally never found anything that borders on the abusive behaviour people seem to complain about. Maybe the mmc is not the type of boyfriend/husband who would suit me, but I am also nothing like the fmc. 

Anyway, definitely not like your regular historical romance novel. It‚Äôs got one foot in the literary fiction genre imo, but was a thoroughly cathartic and immersive experience"
14824,"TBH is the one trilogy I desperately wish I could read for the first time again. I've re-read it multiple times and it never ever fails to take my breath away.

Edit: a word"

14826,"{Cherry beats by vicki james} or probably the only book I had read previously(and reread multiple times since) that would fit the title of well written. It's funny, it's heartfelt, the characters are human and make human mistake, they then grow from them into being better. Also Presley is Sooooo swoon worthy.


However I recently read {a bridge between us by k.k. Allen} , and i was completely invested in the story. A sweet, well written, slightly romeo and juliet'esque story.  So I definitely had to mention that one as well. Definitely going on my to buy list(I'm one of those weirdos who only buys a book after they've read it, so kindle unlimited is one of the best things ever for me. To be fair though I just hate spending money on a book that i could get halfway through and hate it. It's happened too many times)."

14828,"The Memory House by Jenetta James. I narrate the audiobook version (Audible), and didn't expect to enjoy it as a reader; was blown away by the quality of the writing and deftness with which the author switches between and interweaves these two love stories that both concern the same house in London. Will probably appeal most to British readers, or readers with 'British tastes'; the heroine of the modern day story is very English, and the whole feel is sweet, a bit wryly funny, and understated but all the more moving for that. In this case I don't benefit from sales (I was paid a lump sum to narrate the book upfront), this is a genuine recommendation, I don't personally know the author."

Like I think these books are literally as good as LOTR or The Wheel of Time, but they are so underrated because they cater to the feminine gaze and feature a lot of sex, romance, and very long detailed descriptions of gowns and baths."

14848,Not sure.  It‚Äôs definitely enjoyable and well-liked (I liked it!) but I figured it would fall toward the middle.

14878,Clan of The Cave Bear series by Jean Auel! The erotica starts in the second book. They're big books that have lots of details about survival and caveman life. I adore them.
14879,I was wondering if that was the one you had... nice!!
14880,"Honestly I still think about the first Clan of the Cave Bear all the damn time. It's the first and best, though Valley of the Horses is outrageously steamy and I love it for that. It also has the ""hookup with a person who doesn't speak your language"" trope which is...well, I love that stupid trope. 

The Mammoth Hunters turns into a damn soap opera but it's still fun. My mileage decreased drastically from there on in, and I DNF'd the last in the series, which apparently becomes a murder mystery at some point (!!!) but even so, I could not make myself continue."
14881,I pretend that the ending of the last book doesn't exist. Otherwise it's all great üôÇ
14882,I am really sad that there is only one F/F. I love reading F/F and read a lot of M/M but I get the impression that it's harder to publish F/F? I read The Lady's Guide to Celestial Mechanics bc of this sub and loved it!
14883,"Agreed. Not to disparage this list - these are incredible books. However, the industry as a whole really needs to pay more attention to F/F romances."

14887,I just finished A Court of Mist and Fury and was so delighted to see it placed first in the fantasy romance category. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND PICK UP THIS SERIES! It‚Äôll leave you obsessing and swooning over a particular character
14888,I‚Äôve read the first one and really enjoyed it. I just need to pick this one up. Cause I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm going to love it!
14889,You‚Äôre in for a treat! The second book is better than the first
14890,"This is not a slam on the series, as I've heard really good things, but I can't wait for someone to do a parody of these titles called A \[Place\] of \[Noun\] and \[Adjective\]"
14891,Thank you. thank you. THANK YOU!
14892,Sure thing!!
14893,"Amazing! You put so much work into this, thank you! This is going to be a great resource moving forward, especially for newbies starting from scratch who might not know their preferences yet."
14894,Hopefully it can be helpful to people.  But now I‚Äôm worried we‚Äôre giving people the best of the best and then they‚Äôll be let down after they read some of these! üòÜ
14895,Haha you might be onto something! At least there's a lot to choose from
14896,"This is really cool, thanks for creating it! 

That being said, I really don't understand why people like The Hating Game. I read it after seeing it recommended so many places, and it was so bad I'm not even adding it to my Goodreads. 

Courtney Milan's Cyclone series on the other hand... Books usually end with me just sitting on my couch clutching a tea and bawling. They're just so human. Can't believe they didn't make the list!"
14897,"That‚Äôs the great/bad thing about books and these lists, they are so very subjective. I know there is definitely a contingent of people the Hating Game didn‚Äôt work for; it takes all kinds. 

I happen to be one of the people who loved it, but I can understand how people can not enjoy it, too. If you do like the enemies-to-lovers trope, is there a book that you think would have been a good addition to the list? (Im always looking for recs!) 

I think with the Milan books, not as many people associate her with the contemporary books she has written. I know I personally constantly forget she has written them because her historical are so prevalent in my mind. I really should read the Cyclone series, though..."
14898,"Enemies to lovers + Courtney Milan = Hold Me, the 2nd book in the cyclone series! It's a great independent read, no need to start w book 1. 

The elevator scene in the Hating Game was everything, I will give it that. 

I'm not usually a fan of historical so I've been hesitant to try Milan's non-cyclone books, but if she writes them with the same awareness and development as cyclone then I really should give them a try."
14899,I‚Äôll try to get to the one you rec‚Äôd and report back!! üòâ
14900,Enjoy! Looking forward to hearing what you think :)
14901,Insta-saving this! I have read a lot of them but glad to have a few more to complete!
14902,There‚Äôs the full nomination list that might help fill out your TBR. üôÉ
14903,Dangerous... but I‚Äôll probably look at them anyway ü§≠
14904,"Thank you so so so much expatb for doing this ü•∞

I really do feel like all these books truly reflect our sub. This is awesome. 

You‚Äôre a rockstar

And I‚Äôm really gonna miss you asking me to take things on and off of competition mode and lock buddy  ü•∫ (hugs)"

I‚Äôm sure I can figure out some random reason to pester you! üòâ"
14906,"New to this subreddit so I‚Äôm sad I missed the voting but yay to new to me titles. 

Glad to see some of my favorites on this list too."
14907,Bummer!! Sorry you missed out!!
14908,Hopefully there's some new books for you on there as well!
14910,üòò it‚Äôs been really interesting seeing what people think!
14911,"So much work has gone into this! Thank you!

Really bad that I've read about 90% of the list. That still leaves 10% to enjoy!"
14912,You could have a look at all the nominated ones to see if you‚Äôve read all those?
14913,"Thank you, I‚Äôm so so so excited üòÑüíñ"
14914,Happy reading!
14915,"I am definitely going to be adding some of these to my TBR! 

Right after I read Love in the Afternoon for the 5th time... :)"
14916,I may have done that during the polling process. üòâ
14917,What does the open door/closed door thing stand for?
14918,"Open = sex is on page. Described and could be at different levels of explicit-ness. 

Closed = fade to black or mentioned that sex has happened, but it happens off the page. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any ones where sex doesn‚Äôt occur at all and I typically would label those as chaste, but chaste books could fall under a ‚Äúclosed door‚Äù book."
14919,"Thanks. That's what I thought but wasn't positive. 

But now I feel like a creeper, watching through all those open doors. Heh"
14920,You are amazing!! Thank you for this!! üòç
14921,You‚Äôre welcome. Happy reading!!
14922,This looks like a huge labor of love! So many threads fyul of good recommendations! Thanks for putting in the work for this!
14923,Hope you find some new reads you love from it!
14924,I DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR THIS LIST TO COME OUT RIGHT NOW. Even with KU and Libby!!
14925,üòÇ oh man. Sorry!
14926,The Song of Achilles killed me! Such a great read. And it's wild how long Nora Roberts has been writing and still manages to stay relevant. Love her.
14927,Could someone please help me? What does open door/closed door mean in this context?
14928,"Sure thing. 

Open door is sex on the page, described to some level of explicit-ness. 

Close door is when sex happens off the page in some capacity. Could be fade to black, or mentioned as a fact that happens but we get no description of the act.

Edit: Happy cake day!"
14929,"Ohhh that makes so much sense.  Thank you! 

I didn't even know it was my cakeday! Holy fuck 10 years goes fast..."
14930,"WOW, this is awesome!!! Thank you for this post. I knew it was good when one of the #1 books is one of my favorites. Can't wait to check out the others!!!"
14931,"Wow, what a great list! Put a bunch on my tbr and grateful for all of the work the mods did on this."

14935,Was this the post you meant to comment on? Just wanted to double check. üòâ
14936,Oops. It was not. Thanks for catching that!
14937,"I'm so glad this list list was compiled, thank you for the hard work!! Unfortunately it looks like I have tastes a little different than most. There are a few books I totally agree it being there but many just not my cup of tea, even in the genres I typically read.

I'm happy to see Courtney Milan and Sherry Thomas and Elle Kennedy. Evie Dunmore and Sally Thorne too. I don't get the love for Tessa Dare or Helen Hoang. Not judging of course just find it interesting to observe what's popular and how tastes can differ so much."
14938,"I liked a lot of the books on this list and I know the nature of these lists means that they can never be truly comprehensive, but I feel like this list is just a compendium of a bunch of traditionally published romances that got really big marketing campaigns, which makes the overall collection of titles slightly underwhelming. Or maybe this is just coming from someone who is in the romance fandom quite a bit and therefore the online conversations I'm in about the best books are often about indie and smaller titles."
14939,"Yeah I really don‚Äôt need ‚Äúpeople we meet on vacation‚Äù recommended to me again üòÇ impressed with Emily Henry‚Äôs publicist though, they‚Äôre clearly doing something right"
14940,"I feel the same way. What‚Äôs the integrity of the publication? Did the journalist actually read all these books? Because it feels like it was paid, and yeah it pretty much ignores anything selfpub or indie"
14941,"I agree with you about whether the journalist actually read any of these books. I‚Äôve read Neon Gods and found is largely underwhelming with multiple plot holes. It had a promising premise but didn‚Äôt meet the expectations of it. 

I would have loved to see books like One Last Stop and Just Last Night on the list because they‚Äôre couple of the best books I‚Äôve read this year."
14942,Ooo Just Last Night is coming from the library soon!  Glad to hear you enjoyed it because I‚Äôve DNFed a few of her books and am about to give up.
14943,I hated that Hades and Persephone weren‚Äôt actually the original couple but their descendants who are in their 20s/30s. I lost interest fast early on because of it.
14944,"One Last Stop is a huge missing piece from the list, honestly!"
14945,"Vulture is a solid pub and I also have followed the author on Twitter for a while and know she reads a pretty big variety of titles, and is a big fan of the genre too, which is why I'm so surprised this list is so ... boring, haha."
14946,"I have to admit, I‚Äôve only read three in this list, currently reading Honey Girl for book club. Two were five stars, one was a two star. 

Interestingly, a few of these authors were self pub before going trad pub."
14947,this is like when you look for bookshelf inspiration in the tags on instagram and alllllll of the books end up being the same üòí
14948,Yes!! Haha
14949,"This is a solid list but I would definitely not classify Honey Girl as a Romance but instead a contemporary fiction with romance elements because the romance isn‚Äôt the central plot. But it‚Äôs an amazing book by a diverse author, so glad to see it get noticed."
14950,"*cracks knuckles*

Ok, Courtney Milan is amazing. The Duchess War, especially, but I also LOVE Unclaimed.

Bec MacMaster writes big stakes, epic fantasy (and sci-fi) and some of the best sex scenes I've ever read. Highly recommend her London steampunk series.

Sarah MacLean's Rules of scoundrels is also fantastic and I love the little universe she's built with that and her Love by numbers-series.

Lucy Parker writes great contemporary, albeit a bit clean for my taste."
14952,"My pleasure. Romance is a jungle, and without guidence, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff."
14953,Prompty adds to Kindle. Thanks!!
14954,Just downloaded The Duchess War. Thx!
14955,"Dude, Courtney Milan! Love her. I read all of the Brothers Sinister series in like a month because I was hooked. A little cliche, but the writing was very well done and her characters felt real, cliches and all. Definitely worth a read!"
14956,"I love The Outlander series. I‚Äôm also a fan of basically anything by Jude Deveraux, she‚Äôs just so readable, and I‚Äôm a sucker for historical romances."
14957,"Totally agree with you about Outlander. It's not just romance, it's like relationship porn."
14958,"YES! When I am on a roll re-reading it, I find my relationship with my husband actually improves, my warm-fuzzy feelings about Claire and Jamie kind of leak into real life... LOL"
14959,"I just can't classify Outlander as a romance in my head. Don't get me wrong, I *love* the romance in the series, but IMO, it is too much of a mix of genres to recommend it as romance. Not saying you are wrong or that it shouldn't be on this list!!"
14960,Your comment inspired me! I just checked out the first Outlander book from Overdrive! It‚Äôs good so far!!
14961,I like to tell people Outlander is an adventure series with really great romance and sex scenes thrown in.
14962,I feel like I am the only person in the world who can‚Äôt get into the Outlander series.  What am I doing wrong??
14963,"Nothing, I hope - I hated that book.  It falls into that so-common pattern where the female protagonist is supposed to be smart and tough, but she does weak and bloody stupid stuff over and over again.

We're in the minority on this one, though.  Most of my friends loved it, so I have wincingly recommended it to others."
14964,Yes!!! I got fed up with the series since she KEPT doing stupid things and putting everyone in danger....just sit the fuck down woman and take some time to assess the situation for once rather than just rushing in once again.
14965,"[Alyssa Cole](https://alyssacole.com/) has some really good books both historical and contemporary. Her protagonists tend to be women of color and her historicals aren't all set in England (which tends to happen in romances). 

I'm also going to second [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com) as a resource for finding well written reviews of romance novels and their daily sales posts are really nice. 

For contemporaries I also like Shannon Stacey, Linda Howard, Julie James, and Nora Roberts (has a huge back catalog with some paranormals in there). For more erotic writing I've enjoyed the Beyond series from Kit Rocha but it's pretty BDSM heavy."
14966,"Anything by Jennifer Crusie if you like contemporary romances. They're funny and sweet, and the heroines are amazing!"
14967,I love Jennifer Cruisie! More her older stuff than the new stuff but I rarely see her mentioned on these lists. I also recommend Jill Mansell. British author with British humor. I can never put her books down and one of the few authors I read multiple times.
14969,"Just for another opinion, I didn't like Crazy for You (to me, the ex-boyfriend was stalker crazy not funny crazy) or Bet Me (I don't like books where the hero only interacts with the heroine because of a bet - though I will concede that Crusie had the heroine find out about the bet pretty early on). My favorite Crusie books (and she used to be an autobuy author for me) are Faking It, Agnes and the Hitman (which she wrote with Bob Mayer) and Maybe this Time. I would still buy her books if she was at all interested in writing romance these days."
14970,"The ones I re-read the most often are Crazy for You, Anyone but You (Fred is the best book dog EVER), and Fast Women. But most people I know love Bet Me, and usually begin with that one."
14971,"""Anyone But You"" is one of my favorite books of all time because of Fred. I want a Fred dog!"
14972,Chiming in on this . . . I love her!  I probably re-read Manhunting at least twice a year!  That book entertains me every single time.
14973,"Romances generally drive me nuts, but I love Jennifer Crusie!  I keep looking for similar authors but haven't found anyone comparable.  Suzanne Brockmann is probably the closest one so far.  Do you have a second favorite?"
14974,"I am on a perennial search for something that hits the same spot as Cruisie! If you like Regency, Georgette Heyer's heroines are smart and capable. Historical, I'd have to go with Laura Kinsale. For contemporary, I've had luck with Jill Mansell and Catherine Alliott, who are both British writers. Alliott's Rosie Meadows Regrets is one of my favorites! Katie Fforde is another British writer who I've liked. And ooh Meg Cabot! Her books aren't very... deep, and lean YA, but she has a bunch of non-YA standalones too."
14975,"It really depends on what you enjoy in your books.  I prefer romance books with some other plot other than the romance driving it forward.


* Suzanne Brockmann - Navy SEALs heroes


* Nalini Singh - Psy/Changing or Archangel series.  Her style can be a little purple prosey or florid, but the stories are good so I can ignore it.


* Ilona Andrews - considered more urban fantasy but strong romantic elements in all of the books (Hidden Legacy, The Edge, Kate Daniels, Innkeeper Chronicles)


* Linnea Sinclair for scifi romance


* Shelly Laurenston - funny were/shifter romances


* Ann Aguirre - Sirantha Jax sf, Corinne Solomon UF?, Bronze God/Silver Mirror Fantasy


* Lara Adrian and JR Ward - vampire (if you can get over the fact that 200+ year old vampires talk like hardcore gangsters and the names are seriously ridiculous)


I've stopped reading historicals for the most part, but my favorites were:
Julie Garwood, Lisa Kleypas, Julia Quinn, Judith McNaught, Eloisa James, Sherry Thomas


I like Courtney Milan for her modern books and didn't really get into her historicals -but she's really highly rated by readers, especially since her heroes tend to not of the aristocracy.


A good website if you want recommendations is [Dear Author](http://dearauthor.com/) or [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](http://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/)"
14976,"Urgh I love the JR ward novels. I haven't read the latest ones though, just the main brothers (so first 6 I think) Are the later ones still good?"
14977,"JR Ward is probably the only author where I don't want other plots.  I end up skipping entire chapters about the Lessers because I find it so boring.  The later Brotherhood books aren't as good as the first 6 and looking back aren't really worth reading beyond 6.  The Brotherhood Legacy books are okay, not great.  The most recent book, Blood Fury, I found myself way more invested and interested in the second romance involving Saxton than the recruits Peyton and Novo."
14978,I think I stopped after the 10th book and I totally agree. I did love Zsadist's chapters though. Any suggestions based on him and Bella?
14979,"I feel like every long romance series has a book like Zsadist and Bella.  In the Psy/Changling books it's book #3 Caressed by Ice.  The basic premise is seriously damaged hero who the heroine falls in love with and she has to work her ass off to win him over because he feels like he's too damaged.  Though with the Psy/Changling books you do need to read book 2 because it leads into book 3.  However, several of the books in the series might be a good match like Heart of Obsidian or Kiss of Snow.  


If you're really into tortured heroes then The League series by Sherrilyn Kenyon is perfect.  Every hero goes through a horrific childhood and is unloved and betrayed by those closest to him.  Also, there's always a scene where someone/many people who don't like the hero get their comeuppance or find out that they acted crappily."
14981,"I love Julia Quinn‚Äôs The Bridgerton Series! My favorite is Romancing Mister Bridgerton. Also (not part of the series), The Secret Diary of Miss Miranda Cheever.

If you like angst/romance (that heart-clenching feeling!!!!), I recommend Again the Magic by Lisa Kleypas. :)"
14982,"That's the one with Colin, right?"
14983,YES!!!!!!!!!!
14984,"Yeah, that's my favorite Bridgerton too."
14985,Pride and Prejudice.
14986,"Ok, there are lots of good suggestions here (Courtney Milan especially!). I've been reading romances since I was 16 or so, so I'm pretty jaded. I need real conflict, not just plots that could be resolved by two people actually talking to each other, to keep me interested.  There are two series that I just keep coming back to to: 

Joanna Bourne's historical spy romances will ruin you for other series. She has deeply complex (and sometimes quite flawed) characters who have to really earn their happy endings. There's action, romance, and real suspense in each one. Every time I read them I think what a fantastic movie/miniseries they'd make. Her website tells you what order to read them in. Her writing is on a whole different level than your average romance series. 

Her website is here: http://www.joannabourne.com/books.html


Second, I also deeply enjoyed MelJean Brook's Steampunk romance series, and I'm not really into Steampunk. Not going to lie, there are parts that are challenging, but I loved each and every one of these. The world building is astounding and you really really feel the pull for each of the couples. Start with The Iron Duke. 

Update: I don't know how I managed to forget my favorite author ever, Connie Brockway. As You Desire, So Enchanting, The Other Guy's Bride, and My Dearest Enemy are the best of the best. You can read them over and over."
14987,"I'm a total sucker for Lisa Kleypas's Wallflower and Hathaway series. 

Anything by Ilona Andrews (Kate Daniels is my addiction) & Shelly Laurenston (Pride Series and her new Call of Crows) are absolute winners. Humorous, charming, well written and smoking hot. 

Kelly Bowen, particularly Between the Devil and the Duke. 

Lauren Blakely, just finished Most Likely to Score, and I burned through it."
14988,Upvote upon upvote for the Wallflowers series. So good.
14989,"If you're a fan of fantasy, then the Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey is hands down the best. Amazing world building and an epic romance. I give these a read every few years. First book is Kushiel's Dart."
14990,"Yes!! Reading the second trilogy now AGAIN. I second the amazing world building, and if you‚Äôre a history, geography, mythology fan, these books are for you! I love them all dearly. She also has the Santa Olivia series. Futuristic sci fi romance (kinda?) and very different from the Kushiel series. Off the top of my head I can think of six people that I‚Äôve shared Carey with and they all love her work."
14991,"Lauren Blakely - Big Rock serie and Most Valuable Playboy serie : fun contemporary romances

Mariana Zapata - Dear Aaron, The Wall of Winnipeg and Me, Wait for It : great contemporary romances

Katie Kacvinsky - First Comes Love - Young Adult / New Adult / Contemporary Romance"
14992,"I love the classics, though a bit depressing- Gone with the Wind and Wuthering Heights"
14993,"There was a pretty decent (in my opinion) ""sequel"" to Gone With the Wind, written by a different author.  It's called ""Scarlet"" and I really liked it.  The same author has another book, ""Rhett Butler's People"", too, which is on my list to read."
14994,"Just FYI ‚ÄúRhett Butlers People‚Äù was not written by the same author as ‚ÄúScarlett‚Äù. I preferred Scarlett and my mom preferred RBP.

Technically Scarlett was not an ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù sequel and RBP is. So RBP completely leaves Scarlett out of the story telling."
14995,"Ah, thanks for the correction.  And yes, not an authorized sequel hence the ""sequel"" in quotations."
14996,Outlander! It also has a pretty good (and accurate) show on Starz.
14997,"I just finished the show, I can't get enough so will be starting the books soon!"
14998,"And if you like Regency romances, Georgette Heyer is brilliant! I discovered a copy of Friday's Child in my boarding school library many, many years ago, and it was one of those 'life before this book and life after this book' moments for me. I'd start with Frederica or Regency Buck."
14999,"I was wondering if people still read Georgette. She was my gateway drug as well - also via Friday's Child.  Still the best for quality romance, IMHO."
15000,"Laurel K. Hamilton's books about Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter.  If you like vampires and werewolves, or you're not against them but you like murder mysteries, and you like a bit of smut...  you will enjoy these.

Yes, it can get a bit formulaic eventually.  But overall, these books are a fun, sexy read with really interesting plot lines and a strong female lead.  There's a whole ton of them, too.  Enjoy!"
15001,"I enjoyed the first ones when she just kicked ass and did stuff other than sex, but lost all interest when they became pure orgy/furry porn :( Such a waste of a good series."
15002,"Agreed.  Once it devolved into her just using sex as a super power, I was out.  But the earlier books were tons of fun!"
15003,Gone with the Wind!
15004,"If you're into comics, I love the romance between the lead characters of *Saga*."
15005,The Bronze Horseman. Phenomenal series that takes place in Russia during ww2.
15006,One of my all time favorite books
15007,"Nobody mentioned it, so I'll say The Hating Game by Sally Thorne. Up until today, it's one of the best romance novels I've read, and I've read plenty."
15008,"u/CrazyCatLadysCat, THANK YOU! I bought The Hating Game yesterday and chewed through it in like 4 bingey hours. Awesome read. Thank you! Any other great suggestions?"
15009,"Oh, I'm so happy you liked it!! Hmm let me think about it... Okay, anything by Ilona Andrews is golden, their Kate Daniels and Hidden Legacy series are amazing, then Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare if you're into historicals, Penny Reid and her Knitting in the City and Winston Brothers series are pretty good too, and I really like Caitie Quinn's Brew Ha Ha series (they're chaste, as in the most action that happens is a kiss here and there but still really sweet). 

I read a lot of romance as you can tell lol but yeah, I hope you enjoy at least something from this list."
15010,"I loved it. The only thing that threw me off was that I kept picturing Lucy and Josh as Amy and Dan from the TV show Veep, because my god, do those two dislike each other. And yet, they don't. I'll check out some of the others!"
15011,"I don't watch Veep so I had to google them a bit, they seem cute! That enemies-to-lovers trope is my favorite. Generally though, GoodReads is really a great way of finding interesting books, try signing up if you already don't have an account and browse away."
15012,"I hated this book right up until I loved it. I had seen so many people squeeing about it online and I just wasn't impressed. At some point though I realized I was enjoying it. I think if you liked the movie Butter (with Jennifer Garner, was I the only one who saw that?) or Election with Reese Witherspoon, you'd probably like this book as well. It had the same vibe, imo."
15013,"Glad to hear it worked out for you in the end. I've never heard of either of those movies, but yay cuz now I have something to watch. It's been a while since I've seen a good rom-com."
15014,"If you like romantic suspense, read the LOST Series by [Cynthia Eden](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/author/ref=dbs_P_W_auth?_encoding=UTF8&author=Cynthia%20Eden&searchAlias=digital-text&asin=B001IU0Q46)  (really anything by Cynthia Eden). 

If you like vampires, Black Dagger Brotherhood by [J.R. Ward](https://www.amazon.com/J.-R.-Ward/e/B001H6OGQA). 

Contemporary two of my favorites were [The Boy I Hate](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-I-Hate-Taylor-Sullivan-ebook/dp/B0745JT2M5)  and [Hooked On You](https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-You-Brittany-Anne-ebook/dp/B07B3ZRXH4/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) . 

I‚Äôm not much of a paranormal romance person, but the Bad Things Series is AMAZING, by Cynthia Eden. Sooooo good. 

Historical Romance, I adore Julie Garwood‚Äôs [The Bride](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004XFYWNY/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524498104&sr=1-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=the+bride+julie+garwood) . 

And if you want something drama-filled and totally chaotic but still somehow satisfying (eventually), checkout [Lovers and Gamblers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B018HM9OLI/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524498250&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=lovers+and+gamblers+by+jackie+collins)  by Jackie Collins. This book made me very mad but it ended up worth it, lol."
15015,"Okay, I know everyone thinks Nicholas Sparks is trash, but I really liked *The Guardian*."
15016,"For historicals no one beats Mary Balogh!

I also really like Karen Marie Moning and then if you want it super steamy and paranormal Emma Holly is your girl. 

Kresley Cole‚Äôs Professional series is excellent contemporary bdsm romance."
15017,"Punk 57 by Penelope Douglas and the edge of Never by J.A redmerski. 

I also really liked the Preston Brothers series by Jay Mclean and the Off Campus series‚Äôs by Elle Kennedy back in the day during my early college days"
15018,"A Little Life!

You will cry. And then you will cry some more. But it's a great book."
15019,"Sarah Morgan!!!!

I highly recommend the ""From Manhattan With Love"" series. There's three full books in it, and a couple of mini books. Each book is about a focussed on a different girl in a group of friends. 

When you're done with them there's two more series' and the characters between all three series' are kinda connected which is quite nice."
15020,"Anything by J. Daniels!!! I love the Sweet Addiction series and Dirty Deeds, simple premises but sooooo addicting and good!!"
15021,"Her Name In The Sky made me cry like a baby.

Tipping The Velvet is absolutely fucking evil.

Both 10/10, you'll like the pain."
15022,I really loved Sea of Tranquillity by Katja Millay
15023,"[Sherrilyn Kenyon](https://www.sherrilynkenyon.com/) is my go to romance author. Do you like Gods, vampires, werewolves, and soulmates? You'll love her Dark Hunter's Series. Do you like aliens and space? You'll love her *League* series. Do you want something short? She has several short-story anthologies published with other authors that are quite good."
15024,"Anything DH Lawrence.  Women in Love, Sons and Lovers, Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover."
15025,"And The Rainbow, which is my favourite. Ursula in The Rainbow is probably my favourite character in all fiction."
15026,"For historical romance, I keep on rereading ‚ÄúDevil in Winter‚Äù by Lisa Kleypas and ‚ÄúThe Duchess Deal: Girl Meets Duke‚Äù by Tessa Dare."
15027,"Okay, it's horribly cheesy... but I'm such a sucker for ""Capture A Shadow"" by Leigh Michaels."
15028,"Castles by Tracie Peterson...series of 4 stories, first two go together, third and fourth stand alone."
15029,"Old fashioned, but I like Melissa Nathan, especially 'Persuading Annie'. I really dig Ilona Andrews (read every book)  and recently discovered Racheline Maltese and read her 'A Queen from the North', an alternate history take on Royal romance.

Beverly Jenkins writes historical romance with woc. I love her strong heroines."
15030,"Forever Amber, if you like historical romances. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_Amber"
15031,"I recently read 'The Hourglass' by Tracy Rees. I'm not one for a romance but thought I'd give it a go as it's set in Tenby and I know the place well. I absolutely loved it, it made me laugh and cry. Been on the lookout for something similar ever since."
15032,"I really like British author Jojo Moyes.  Me Before You is her most popular book, but she is fairly prolific.  A lot of her stories are told through flashback mingled with present day events and several of them are based on historical events.  I‚Äôve read almost all of her books and have yet to be disappointed."
15033,Memoirs of a Geisha and perhaps South of the Border West of the Sun
15034,"The Last Unicorn. It's a really nice heartbreaking romance and fantasy.

And idk if it's read worthy, because I haven't read it yet, but I took one of my mom's romance novels. It has Icelandic vocab in it for some reason and learning foreign languages is my hobby."
15035,The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson. Not your typical love story especially when you first start  reading it you will think wtf! But seriously worth a read!
15036,The Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. And anything by Linda Gillard.
15037,"i like fantasy romance, which is very hard to find. recent ones i have found and would recommend are The Winter King and Lord of the Fading Lands by CL Wilson, and Master of Crows by Grace Draven. also another one whose name and title i just cannot for the life of me remember, a retelling of Persephone and Hades only Hades is a female and its a lesbian romance. super good."
15038,Surprised no ones mentioned Kristen Ashley yet. Her Rock Chick series is a great place to start but the rest of her books are excellent as well! I‚Äôve reread them over and over!
15039,"Robyn Carr - Any Day Now

Sherryl Woods - A Slice of Heaven

Nora Roberts - The Search"
15040,"Not a romance reader, but Wuthering Heights was seriously good."
15041,Mr. Perfect by Linda Howard
15042,"Carian Cole for dark contemporary romance . 

JT Geissinger‚Äôs ‚Äúbad habit‚Äù series is probably my favorite of all time

Also LOVE elisabeth naughton"
15043,On my last romance novel kick I enjoyed Hazard by Jo Beverley (Regency setting).
15044,"No one has said this yet so I‚Äôm nervous I‚Äôm a major dork.

I liked Annette Marie‚Äôs Shadow Weave series and her other Steel series."
15045,"To add some non\-traditional authors to the mix \(self\-published\):

Sweet\-contemporary: Bria Quinlan

Sweet\-paranormal: Kristen Painter

Historical: Vivienne Westlake

Erotic Romance \- Contemporary & Paranormal: KB Alan

And a couple fave traditional that I haven't seen mentioned yet:

Historical: Eva Leigh/Zoe Archer

Erotic Romance: Tiffany Reisz"
15046,"Anthony Hope, *Sophy of Kravonia* (1906)."
15047,"Linda Howard is my favorite, hers are thrillers and mysteries and honestly fucking amazing reads."
15048,My all time favorite is Dust Devil by Rebecca Brandewyne
15049,"‚ÄúWill you be there?‚Äù by Guillaume Musso. 

Tragedy, time travel, tough decisions, the chance to redo something again. It‚Äôs not only about romantic love between a couple, but also friendships and parenthood.

Edit: Added details"
15050,"The Bad Girl by Mario Vargas Llosa

Not a romance book per se, that‚Äôs just not my genre, but a fantastic story about a great love."
15051,"Written in around the 4th century CE, Kalidasa‚Äôs [Shakuntala] (http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/shakuntala_ryder.pdf) is beautiful."
15052,Could anyone recommend a clean/non-sexual or religious contemporary or futuristic romance that's on their To-Read list?
15053,Outlander by Diana Gabaldon!
15054,Pride & Prejudice!! Mr. Darcy sets an impossibly high standard. Anything by Jane Austen is great in general
15055,"Susan Mallery does somewhat fluffy contemporary romance with a sense of humor and light on the sex. Catherine Anderson is also fairly good. 
Lora Leigh writes a mix of things but is a lot heavier on the sex."
15056,"I love a rom com. Some of my favourite authors are: Sarra Manning, Lindsey Kelk, Sarah Morgan, Paige Toone, Vicky Pattinson, Sarah Dessen (young adult fiction but I love them at age 27). Where Rainbows End by Ceceila Ahern is my favourite book ever. I also discovered an author through reddit - Louise Burness whose books I just read and enjoyed lots."
15057,"A walk to remember.

It's actually amazing."
15059,"If Princess Bride counts, Princess Bride. People shit on the book but its hella good and funny."
15060,"My favorite romances: Julia Quinn's Bridgerton and Smythe Smith books

Lynn Kurland's De Piaget time travel romance series

Sarah Morgan's From Manhattan with Love series

Jennifer Robson's Great War trilogy

I'm also enjoying North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell which isn't a romance per se but its like a refined version of Pride and Prejudice."
15061,"I love North and South. If you have Netflix, BBC adapted it into a four part mini series and it is exceptional in my opinion"
15062,"I love all kinds of romance books, Nora Roberts is a great writer, I was addicted to paranormal romances for the longest so I read all the vampire diaries,vampire academy, blue bloods series,twilight, one of my favorite series is called fallen by Lauren Kate very good love story dealing with angels and demons. I also loved the city of bones series! Just recently I finished called carry on! I loved it , it wasn‚Äôt mainly about the romantic relationship but I still loved it for the characterization of the couple!"
15063,"I got into romance in the last few months so I haven't read that much but I love everything Tessa Dare, The Hating Game and The Kiss Quotient. Knit One Girl Two is a novella but it's so so cute."
15064,I'm really into anything by Tessa Dare right now. She creates intriguing characters and wonderfully silly situations that some how fit perfectly into the story.
15065,"Well if you want to combine literature with romance, Pride and Prejudice is one of the earliest romance novels, and it's considered great literature.  It's got all the classic tropes...the high spirited female heroine with a bit of a temper, the initially stand-offish hero who can't help falling for her, lots of misunderstandings and interfering outsiders, etc.   You've probably already read it, but if not, it's a very enjoyable book!"
15066,"In my experience, the people who proudly and snobbishly look down on romance novels have never read a good romance novel. They're often the only places to find good queer rep. I don't read a tonne of it but I do love what I've read. 


I'm a big fan of Sarah Waters' books and I've been listening to The Magpie Lord by KJ Charles on audiobook (the whole series is fantastic). There is also this short story called The Cybernetic Tea Shop by Meredith Katz which I recommend constantly, I absolutely adore it and everyone needs it in their lives. It's short and there is no erotic element because they're both ace lesbians. 


Sidenote: I can't stand Call Me By Your Name, the age gap/paedophilia thing makes me super uncomfortable. There's too much of that in queer romances, those unhealthy power dynamics."
15067,"I agree so much with the romance book comment. I think people who don‚Äôt particularly like it assume it‚Äôs all just cheesy teenage garbage. And I respectfully disagree with your comment on CMBYN. I personally don‚Äôt view it as pedophilia because he was the age of consent, about to be done school, and Oliver was technically a second year college student. But to each their own. The movie definitely did not help this case by casting Armie Hammer though, it made it look way worse. I think the writing in the book itself is much better than the movie however, and is truly a work of art. I totally understand the power dynamics bit, it‚Äôs disappointing that we don‚Äôt have that much good healthy LGBT content to consume."
15068,"At the risk of being 'that person' and making your opinion flip, a lot of it follows the idea that things women like are inherently not as good/worth people's time; More women are into romance novels than men so they hold less value. Star Trek was seen as childish drivel when the fanbase was all women, but when men started watching it became a sci fi classic overnight. Same with video games. Same with a lot of fiction that we have dubbed chick lit: If we brushed off all military fiction and action novels as dick lit people would be up in arms. Fan fiction isn't 'real writing' because most of the writers are women, even if a lot of them are published authors in their 50s. A lot of decent musicians, namely the Beatles, were derided for years because the fans were women, meaning they were just a silly boyband, but now most people consider them one of the most important bands in our history. It's especially bad when it's *teenage* girls. It's a whole thing. 


Sorry, had to get that out since it's an important factor in the... Delegitimising? of certain subsections of literature, art, film, TV, music, general culture etc. 


See also: cooking as a housewife is unskilled, basic labour with no value but being a chef can make you very rich and famous. Things like knitting, embroidery and crocheting aren't art no matter how much skill is needed, they're just boring crafts. 


Regarding CMBYN I guess it's just a matter of what you're personally comfortable with, you know? My boyfriend and I both think it's icky but you can argue that's because we're both queer and were assaulted/abused by people in similar positions. I absolutely respect your difference of opinion, it's just a case of something not being for me. In a way it's similar to my teenaged self really enjoying Forbidden, which is a book about incest (though I absolutely don't agree with it and what went down in general it's still an interesting love story), or all the people who adore Loving Annabelle, which is about a student seducing a teacher."
15069,Don‚Äôt have much to say except I agree completely with everything you‚Äôve said! It‚Äôs so sad the way a women‚Äôs view is treated in society.
15070,"Okay thank you, I was genuinely worried I'd accidentally start a fight. It's hard to tell on Reddit and I'm autistic so I usually realise when it's too late. 


I just realised I miscalculated the age of the fanfic writers. Since fan fiction as we know it started primarily with underground star trek slash fiction networks (it's actually a fascinating history, they had to find ways to connect and share in the 60s and 70s when sharing those stories and the explicitly gay erotic art wasn't legal and they had to hand copy their stories multiple times because there were no computers and printers) around the first series and the women in question were usually starting around their 20s, the fan fic writers/authors I'm thinking of would actually be around 70-80 now. They're still often active in the fan fic communities, though they aren't super visible because we all make assumptions."
15072,"I mean, I've talked to quite a few women who were involved and there was without a doubt a tonne of underground slash fiction trading. At that point there really weren't that many male Trekkies in comparison and not many, if any, were involved like they were. I'm also going to point out that dude, it was underground. They were hiding it. If you weren't on the mailing list you weren't going to find out about it because a lot of it wasnt legal to share around."
15073,Also a huge fan of the Magpie Lord series.
15074,Have you read anything else by her? I've been looking at An Unseen Attraction but I'm unsure and audible credits cost ¬£8.
15075,"I don't understand the criteria on this sub for giving downvotes.

How could your post here (and underneath) possibly qualify for a downvote?

Bizarre."
15076,"I'm guessing someone either saw and disliked what I said in another comment and is going through my other ones or has a personal vendetta against KJ Charles? Who knows, my dude."
15077,"I think I've read everything she's written except for her MF romance. Did you already read the short stories in the Charm of Magpies series? ""Interlude with Tattoos"" is absolutely amazing. ""Jackdaw"" is set in the same world and allows you to see Stephen Day from another perspective. I don't listen to audiobooks very often so I have no idea how Audible credit work. While I love all of her work, the Charm of Magpies series is by far my absolute favourite. ""Band Sinister"", a stand-alone, is also highly recommended."
15078,"Yeah, the short stories are included in the audiobooks. I recommend them, he reads them so so well. I'll absolutely check that out, thank you!"
15079,"I used to read romance when I was younger and liked the YA genre. My favorite one is the series Vampire Academy and Dimitri and Rose from there... Cheasy, I know :D

I don't read romance anymore tho, I'm not saying it's bad but I feel that if I read other genres I can learn more from them."
15080,I loved that series as a teen! Dmitri and Rose were just perfect!
15081,"Yes, he was also totally my type :D. Wanted to be her so badly :D"
15082,You and me both!! I remember waiting for the last book to be released and the wait was pure torture!
15083,I can probably say my bf has more or less the same description üòé
15084,That‚Äôs awesome dude üòé Mine is the complete opposite in looks but he‚Äôs a sweetie!
15085,Damn girl üòé
15086,"I mostly read historical romance and I really love Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, Sarah MacLean and Tessa Dare. Alyssa Cole's Reluctant Royals series is a very cute contemporary. Sarah Maclean's website and the website Smart Bitches Trashy Books are great places to get recommendations."
15087,"Alyssa Cole is great! She does historical romance, too, if you haven't read them."
15088,"I've heard great things about them, but haven't gotten to them yet. I believe there's one set in the Civil War that I've been meaning to pick up!"
15089,"Romance novels are my guilty pleasure. I actually hide two Tupperware totes in an extra linen closet. I enjoy historical romances.

My favorite author is Judith McNaught. Her Westmoreland series is my favorite. I know there is some controversy about ‚ÄúWhitney, My Love‚Äù promoting DV, but the books are really good."
