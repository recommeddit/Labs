1248,"S'mores - local place by me in NJ does a graham cracker ice cream, with chocolate chips and marshmallow mixed in.  It's fucking intense."
1249,Oreo. Because oreo is the answer to life
1251,Coffee Ice Cream all the way. I have always said its like eating the smell of coffee.
1252,Strawberry Swirl. Two amazing flavors at the same time.
1253,rocky road is fucking delicious
1254,Neapolitan - favourite three all in one :)
1255,"So i used to work at cold stone and you guys need to try this creation of mine . I call it the CBCRC.

CB - Cake Batter Ice Cream
C- Caramel
R- Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
C- Cake. Legit cake mixed in.

Fuse these 4 items together to enjoy the ice cream of the gods."
1256,Mint chocolate chip. It's refreshing and delicious. Plus I crave it every month and it helps me feel less crappy.
1257,MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM IS THE ONE THAT I THINK TASTES THE BEST BECAUSE I THINK IT TASTES THE BEST.
1258,"Bi-rite in SF makes some of my favorite commercial ice cream.

Also Blue Bunny in Texas (which is exported to other places) has the best commercial strawberry ice cream I've ever had.

But I like my own best, preferably made with LN2.  Although a friend's goat cheese with fig jam was good. (Better after I added balsamic vinegar to it.)

Bananas Foster yogurt, with burnt sugar and quite rummy boozy thanks to the LN2 hit...

Blueberry lemon yogurt.

Coconut milk with palm sugar.

Sweet cream with blackberries and macadamias (a favorite at ColdStone when they have the components)

Rose petal jam in plain yogurt.

Honey with white sesame brittle.

Forbidden rice and banana."
1259,Popsicle.
1260,Anchovy
1261,Not as good as pickle flavor.
1262,I love many ice creams but when in doubt cookies n cream
1263,Amen if the Ben and Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie isn’t there and u can’t even find a cookies n cream somewhere head to the nearest sonic/McDonald’s/DQ and get a Oreo whatever at those places problem solved
1264,"Ben and Jerry's ""half baked"". It's chocolate-vanilla with cookie dough and brownie... hard to scoop with a spoon but so worth it."
1265,"""Half baked"" is also the state in which it's best consumed."
1266,You're only half right.
1267,"The Tonight Dough is best - caramel and chocolate ice cream with Oreo, chocolate chip cookie dough AND peanut butter cookie dough."
1268,"As an employee of my college’s Ben and Jerry’s location who has an opinion on every flavor we have available, I’m gonna have to agree with you on this. Tonight Dough is by far my favorite."
1269,"I haven't tried it yet, but I bought some the other day because I had a coupon. Now I'm excited! Yay!"
1270,"So hard to find most of the time!  Also thumbs up for Cherry Garcia.  I’ve had a craving for about a week, but too scared to venture out in COVID-land."
1271,Incorrect. Phish Food is the best.
1272,Agreed! Half baked is second best.
1273,"oh god i have a large family of 8 siblings so putting my ice cream in the freezer was a big no-no as one of them would easily take it, so... I hid it under my bed and just went on about my day until i was like “oh ye i have ice cream”, by the time i got to it, it was a melted mess of warm ice cream, chocolate and marshmallow. If diabetes was an ice cream, it would be the melted mess i saw that day, and ye i still ate it and it was sickly sweet, never again Phish Food, never again"
1274,There is a pb half baked that is leagues above the original
1275,"You’re so wrong. It’s not even the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor. It looks amazing on paper, and in the store. The flavors really are pretty bland though, not a strong vanilla or chocolate flavor - mostly just sweet. Also, eating it becomes a process of trying to just get that one last chunk, eating the whole thing, and feeling ill.   
  
It’s not a bad flavor, at all. But certainly not the best. Cherry Garcia stomps Half Baked."
1276,I disagree with you but I respect your passion. Half baked all the way
1277,"You're both either incorrect or spelling ""Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch"" wrong."
1278,"Vanilla. Real vanilla.

I can’t believe only one person has said this yet."
1279,Idk. I feel like I need either vanilla bean or French vanilla.
1280,Oh these are the BEST!
1281,"Yes, with the little bits of bean in it."
1282,YES!  Vanilla bean in a good quality ice cream <3
1283,Some real vanilla is the fucking best no question
1284,People always get angry with me when I say that vanilla is my favorite
1285,"They hate you for your confidence in saying it because secretly they like it too. REAL vanilla ice cream, as in you can see the specks of ground vanilla bean in it, tastes amazing. The cheap shit they can't legally call ice cream and is the color of glue, not so much."
1286,"Which quality, authentic vanilla ice cream would you recommend? It’s my fave but I don’t think I’ve ever had the “good” stuff. I’m in the UK if it makes a difference."
1287,The best vanilla ice cream I’ve ever had is “Homemade Vanilla” from Blue Bell. It is only sold in the southern US as far as I know but if you ever come on down here you should give it a try!
1288,Tillamook.
1289,Ye am a vanilla guy too when you ask somebody about their favorite flavor most of people will say chocolate I really hate the chocolate flavor it ruins my day
1290,I fucking love chocolate but chocolate ice cream is just... Weird
1291,"YES! It's chalky, and I hate it."
1292,YAY! I found people who don't think I'm weird for not liking chocolate ice cream!
1293,One of my wife and my's biggest dessert-based arguments.
1294,"It's the cocoa powder, it's like you can taste the alkaline substance they process it with."
1295,Yes!!! I'll take literally chocolate anything EXCEPT ice cream. It just doesn't taste right.
1296,Vanilla is made for ice cream. Chocolate tastes like you're trying to down some tar.
1297,It's the finest of the flavors.
1298,"Gotta see the show cause then you know the Vertigo is gonna grow, it gets so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver."
1299,Fu*king vanilla. Yyyyyeeeeesssss!!!!!!!!!
1300,Here for this answer.
1301,Nothing better than the classic.
1302,Definitely vanilla!
1304,Have you tried Blue Bell Cookie Two-Step? Cookie dough in cookies and cream ice cream. It will change your life.
1305,"And blue bell has *damn* good cookies and cream ice cream. 

Cookies Two Step is a national treasure and we always have it in our freezer. When my husband and I first started dating (before this flavor came out) I preferred Cookies and Cream, he preferred Cookie Dough. We always bought one of each. When two-step released I knew it was a fateful sign of our inevitable union from the dairy gods"
1306,I just discovered this two weeks ago and it changed my life
1307,"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, to be precise."
1308,"The chocolate chip part is the worst part, I just want to eat the cookie dough"
1309,"So true, I don’t like those chips coming down on my teeth and settling in there."
1310,"Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, to be meticulously precise-er."
1311,Thanks u/dick-nipples
1312,Cookies n creme
1313,In my state we have blue bell ice cream. And a couple years ago they came out with cooki two step. It was cookies n cream with chocolate chip cookie dough. It’s literal heaven in a tub.
1314,Have you tried Blue Bell cookie dough overload? It's 3 different types of cookie dough and is my new favorite blue bell flavor
1315,I need to now
1316,"> In my state we have blue bell ice cream. 

Wait...some states don't have Blue Bell?! Oh you poor, poor innocents who've never lived."
47704,Texas
1318,The best! I even use my whey protein in cookies n creme flavor.
1319,The absolute best
1320,It's up there with strawberry icecream with actual strawberry chunks
1321,"u know how sometimes they'll have strawberry as a flavor, but also strawberry short cake?

I wanna try cookies n creme pie ice cream"
1322,"Coffee. 

I know, I know, apparently I’m a monster. This has already been explained to me, but thank you for your concern."
1323,Haagen Das coffee ice cream fmu
1324,This a thousand times!!
1325,Starbucks used to make this java chip......
1326,"My local ice cream place makes an espresso Oreo ice cream. It's coffee ice cream with chunks of Oreo in it. I don't even like coffee, but that ice cream is to die for.

...Now I really want some. But I'm sure they're closed. Damn virus!"
1327,Coffee Heath Bar Homie.
1328,It actually is now coffee toffee... they got into it with the heath people apparently.
1329,Ben & Jerry’s coffee Heath Bar. Love it
1330,Very very underrated flavour but god damn it is THE BEST
1331,"You would like my grandma. She didn’t stockpile any toilet paper, she bought coffee ice cream. She literally had to store some at my moms house because she bought too much for her freezer."
1332,Coffee is the best flavor.
1333,Mint chocolate chip!!
1334,Finally!! :D
1335,Exactly what I was thinking! :)
1336,The best answer
1337,But only Baskin Robbins!  It’s the best.
1338,"while the baskin robbins mint chocolate chip is certainly king, I'd argue bluebell's is still good!"
1339,I would give you award if I could. baskin robbins mint chocolate chip is the greatest.
1340,Literally in my freezer right now. My all time favourite
1341,Chocolate peanut butter cup
1342,Yup peanut butter in ice cream is amazing
1343,Moose tracks gang
1344,Blue bell - Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough. Red container
1345,"salted caramel 

Fight me."
1346,Have you tried the Talenti version? It's amazing
1347,Talenti makes the best salted caramel in my opinion. They also make a damn good raspberry cheesecake. Carb and calorie heaven right to your mouth and gut.
1348,Only sane motherfucker in this thread
1349,"Chocolate. 
But everyone has their preferences. My taste buds hate vanilla and strawberry and pretty much everything else. But chocolate is the best god damn thing ever"
1350,"Hmmmm.... username does not check out.....

But i do agree chocolate is the best! :)"
1351,I will eat pretty much any kind of ice cream that includes chocolate
1352,Chunky Monkey!
1353,i second this
1354,"Thirded. You're dealing with chocolate chunks, walnuts, and freaking banana flavored ice cream. It's an amazing combination."
1355,Chocolate Fudge Brownie
1356,"Very close to my favorite, which the camp I went to named Up Dog (salted caramel IC and brownie batter IC)"
1357,Hazelnut!
1359,pistacchio with stracciatella is always my go-to combination
1360,This ^. Nothing beats this.
1361,"Try pistachio with cardamom, I've had it at an Afghan restaurant and it instantly changed my favourite flavour of icecream from just pistachio to pistachio and cardamom because of the added richness and depth of flavour."
1362,Vanilla is literally the most versed flavor of ice cream. A true stepping stone for all other flavors. Goes with any toppings.
1363,"It’s the second most expensive spice behind saffron. It is so ubiquitous it is considered the “standard” flavor. You can go to any shop and you KNOW they’ll have it. 

Vanilla is the king, nay, the God of ice cream."
1364,I always thought that vanilla was boring and plain . . . but that's because I had only ever known cheap ice cream. Even spending the extra little bit and getting Haagen Dazs over the bulk stuff is a fair step up in terms of quality.
1365,Haagen Daas vanilla bean is undeniably amazing
1366,French vanilla is where it's at.
1367,"Either strawberry or black raspberry.

Can't go wrong with a high-quality vanilla soft serve, though."
1368,Chocolate Moose Tracks
1369,Rocky Road!
1370,"That Cake Batter at Cold Stone deeeewd. Or Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked. 

Either of those^"
1371,Good strawberry is absolutely delicious.
1372,"Butter Pecan, or Maple Walnut.

Otherwise, Moose Tracks. I know that MT isn't just one flavor, but it's still delicious."
1373,Moose tracks is crack.
1375,Here here!!!
1376,"MCC, Bitches!!"
1377,rocky road!
1378,Bonus if it's Rite Aid Rocky Road ... 1990s LA college student me considered Rite Aid Rocky Road the apex of good living.
1379,Thrifty's for life!
1380,You and Weird Al!!!
1382,"Ben and Jerry's used to make a flavor called Holy Cannoli, and it was fantastic. I haven't seen it in a long time, though, so it might be retired."
1383,"They actually just relaunched a Cannoli flavor, but I believe it's different from Holy Cannoli."
1384,Butter Pecan
1385,Yes that's my goto flavor of reasonably common ice cream. Used to be my favorite but now Cinnamon Dulce de Leche and Salted Caramel have edged it out. But Butter Pecan on warm apple cobbler is crazy good.
1386,I love butter pecan ... except when you get a bad pecan that has that awful bitter flavor.  No amount of ice cream can cover up that nastiness.
1387,"Pistachio slaps, banana does too

Blue moon is quite lovely.  What flavor is blue?

For topping with fruit I'd say vanilla bean.

Mint chocolate's delicious but only when green

&#x200B;

Chocolate explosion is great in small servings

Though three scoops of that can be rather unnerving

But flavor's not all, for the butterfat mix

Makes creamy consistency licks upon licks"
1388,Love blue moon. I also like Superman.
1389,Coconut (w/ a scoop of chocolate)
1390,There used to be a Thai restaurant in my hometown that made these amazing ice cream sundaes. It was coconut ice cream with chunks of coconut covered in chocolate along with fruit and whipped cream. They were so good. Unfortunately the restaurant was in the cursed restaurant slot of the strip mall; there's been about a dozen different restaurants there in my lifetime. The thai place did last longer than most though.
1391,Lavender honey.
1392,I've always wanted to try that but I've never seen it here :(
1393,"Mint chocolate

edit: OKAY mint chocolate CHIP"
1394,Mint chocolate CHIP bruh.  Put some respect on its name.
1395,Better be green though.  I've seen someone try to sell it looking all white.  GTFO!
1396,MINT CHOCOLATE BEST ICE CREAM FLAVOR
1397,"Mint, but you can keep the chips tbh. They're always low quality chocolate, and in a milkshake they just clog the straw."
1398,Idk I just like chocolate. And I never drank a milkshake
1399,"I love me some chocolate, I just don't appreciate low quality chocolate, especially when it's in otherwise quality foods.

I understand that I am in the minority."
1400,"No, you're right. I never liked how you have to either chew on those dumpster tier chocolate chips or just swish them around in your mouth until they melt, it ruins the flow of eating the ice cream"
1401,"I like it when they're flakes instead of chips, like in Baskin Robbins' version. Alden's is even better but harder to find."
1402,It's so hard to find just mint ice cream though
1403,I feel people are polarized on mint chocolate. I love mint chocolate but no one i know likes it.
1404,You've found a mind chocolate club
1405,The one true religion.
1406,"All of them. \*mic drop\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: It's sad that this is my most upvoted comment lol (I don't even have 1k karma)

EDIT 2: ok it is not sad anymore this has over 50"
1407,We stand for unity
1408,"Hard to pick just one, but homemade rhubarb ice cream is high up on the top. And to ad some luxury, put some homemade rhubarb jam to it. That is amazing."
1409,Mint chocolate chip/cookies and cream. Or mint cookies and cream.
1410,"A local dairy near me does Amaretto and Black Cherry. It is literally heaven. 

Another local one (local to my Mum) does Cola Cube flavour. Weirdly amazing. Up there with the Irn Bru ice cream I had in Lanarkshire."
1411,Lemon
1412,Haagen Daz lemon sorbet tastes like summer and it's wonderful.
1413,Or even lemon curd.
1414,"Crystallized ginger. I've only seen it in a few stores, but it's sweet, it's spicy, it has a little bit of crunch, and leaves you with a warm feeling."
1415,I’ve never heard of this flavor before and yet I’m suddenly craving it.
1416,Some Thai restaurants serve ginger ice cream.
1417,Stracciatella
1418,The fuck is that
1419,"Looks like /u/Zuendl11 was right. Wikipedia says, ""[Stracciatella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stracciatella_(ice_cream) ) is a variety of gelato, consisting of milk-based ice cream filled with fine, irregular shavings of chocolate."""
1420,"Oh, fuck yeah. We get that in those kinda shitty blocks, which is but a whisper of the glory of proper stracciatella... but oh, what a whisper it is"
1422,Especially when it has pieces of strawberry in it
1423,"I'm the opposite, I hate when there are strawberries in it.  The texture of a frozen, but thawing strawberry, isn't appealing to me.

I can never find strawberry ice cream without strawberries in the store though."
1424,Like frozen boogers! So gross.
1425,Tiramisu
1426,"I LOVE ROCKY ROAD!!! If anyone gets that reference, we're homies for life. 

And if anyone gets THAT second reference, I worship you as my new god."
1427,Weird Al is my daddy!
1428,"Either Superman or blue moon. And I don’t mean that dyed vanilla Superman, I mean the Midwest Superman that has blue moon as the blue flavor. (Also not blue moon as in the beer)"
1429,Haagen-Dazs chocolate peanut butter.
1430,"My 3 favorites are Cherry Garcia, Phish Food & Moose tracks"
1431,"First mention of cherry garcia is way too far down, insanity!"

1440,Sweet cream from cold stone. Don’t you dare add anything to it.
1441,Mint choc chip. I like to add smarties to my ice cream too.
1442,"Matcha! 
And Whiskey Hazelnut"
1443,MFin' pralines and cream.
1444,"Ben and Jerry's used to do a flavour called ""Chubby Hubby"" if memory serves me correctly it was a malt ice cream with peanut butter filled chocolate covered salted pretzels.
It was the bomb, sadly gone to the graveyard of flavours now...."
1445,"The one you get from mixing Strawberry & Vanilla, I personally like to call it Valentine flavor xD"
1446,I’m gonna have to try that. That sounds really good.
1448,Cotton candy

1450,Strawberry or pistachio
1451,Turkey Hill fudge ripple specifically! It was the brand Angel Food when I was a kid in the 80s - 90s. Turkey Hill bought out.
1452,Moose tracks tho 😏😋
1453,Vanilla. Sounds lame. But.... you can make it whatever you want with any toppings. Unlimited possibilities.
1454,"Cotton candy, no doubts."
1455,elderflower sorbet *chefs kiss*
1456,Anything from Blue Bell
1457,Birthday cake.
1458,"Top 3: licorice, banana pudding, vanilla w/ maraschino cherries mixed in

Flavor I thought I wouldn't like: Pistachio. I'd never even eaten a pistachio and didn't know what to expect from it. I absolutely love it though.

Strangest flavor: Black sesame was a very new flavor to me, though I realize it's not unusual. So was lavender rose when I first made it."
1459,"Lavender rose ? Tell me more about it. 

Never had banana pudding, did you make it? Is it literally pudding in the ice cream? 

Is the licorne from your top 3 the black licorice?"
1460,"The lavender rose just sounded pretty, and I'd never had floral flavors before. I used [this](https://www.sugarhero.com/lavender-rose-ice-cream/) recipe and tweaked it here and there. It's not bad at all, though my family wasn't as fond of the floral flavor (more for me at least). 

The banana pudding is usually made w/ an egg/custard-y vanilla base, some bananas, and Nilla wafers (and topped w/ whipped cream, of course). Dessert puddings are also cream-based and just isn't frozen (and maybe has a few different ingredients/proportions), so in a sense, it is kind of like making the pudding and just putting it into ice cream. Though I think technically, my recipe would've made it banana custard...but whatever. I think most banana pudding recipes I know use eggs in the pudding anyway, though I haven't made it myself. 

The licorice one is mainly because black licorice is my favorite candy. Even if it weren't, the flavor of it seems to do well in cold desserts like ice cream. But it's definitely more unusual. I've only had it a couple times since it's very hard to find. I hope to try and make it soon though."
1461,"Black licorice hard to find? 
I hate this flavour with passion. Can’t stand it. Hate its smell too. My mother loves it tho. 
I think it’s pretty easy to find in Canada/ Quebec. 

Banana pudding must be good, I love bananas! I am definitely getting a list of ice cream to try with this post. I will try your lavender recipe for sure!"
1462,"Yeah, it's definitely not popular in the US, unfortunately. Seems to be more of a Canada/Northern Europe type of thing because I havent heard of it being widely enjoyed elsewhere. 

Hope you enjoy trying some of them out!"
1463,Thanks! I sure will do!
1464,Chai-Gingersnap was amaaazing
1465,Whats that?
1466,That sounds so good!  Recipe? :-)
1467,"full disclosure: i’ve eaten these but i’ve never made them, i’m just a fan who likes to appreciate all y’all’s creativity

1-  goat cheese, fig, and honey- creamy, slightly salty, but sweet. like if cheesecake were part of the base but not actually mixed in as chunks, plus fig jam and honey swirled in. had this in seville spain

2-  creme caramel almond crunch - if you’ve seen the movie “up”, it features an ice cream shop based in the suburbs of san francisco and it’s real and has delicious ice cream.  swirls of buttery creme caramel and crunchy almond toffee in a vanilla base. 

3- pistachio. i had  the most delicious, rich, flavorful pistachio gelato in sienna italy. the pistachio flavor was so pronounced and yet the gelato was only slightly green. i can imagine it had to have pistachio butter as part of the base, aside from maybe oils? 

these are the flavors i want all the other flavors to taste like."
1468,"Goat cheese honey and fig I can figure out what it taste like, and must be amazing. Crème caramel should taste very great too. Thanks for your answer!"
1469,"Top 3 in order: Mint Chocolate Chip, Coffee, Vanilla Bean

Flavor I thought I'd hate but loved: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I thought that the cookie dough would be too much but it works super well.

Strangest flavor: [We have BBQ ice cream in Kansas City](https://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article160536829.html). Not for me personally, too much going on."
1470,"Wo! Bbq ice cream? And I thought steak chips were strange. At least your tried it. 

I can get behind coffee and vanilla beans. I really like these two too. 

To make chocolate chip cookie dough, the dough has to be pasteurized?"
1471,There are recipes for cookie dough that are eggless.  David Lebovitz has a recipe in his ice cream book.
1472,"Oh man! Not another ice cream book I have to buy 
(🙄 joke, I love cooking recipe book)

Is his book good? Do you recommend it ??"
1473,"Oh my gosh!  His book is AMAZING!  Totally worth the purchase.  I got a used copy on Amazon that didn’t cost too much.  There are a lot of illustrated guides that really help out, especially if you’re new to making ice cream like me. Also, he has really funny anecdotes at the beginning of each recipe that I love.  It’s probably one of my top 5 favorite cookbooks.  

Edit to add:  He has whole chapters with recipes for add ins, toppings, cones, etc.  Some of his topping and mix in recipes are the bomb.  He’s a pastry chef so there’s a lot of really unique stuff."
1474,"Cool! Thanks. Kinda looks like Dana Cree book. I’ve added to my wish list tho. Best book I buy, it’s that’s one!!"
1475,"Top 3: Anything chocolate based with chocolate flakes, Swiss Orange Chip which is a chocolate orange base, and Vanilla bean. 

Most interesting which I really liked: Ube

Strangest flavor: Green Tea, which I hated, tasted like the cream was steeped with grass clippings."
1476,"Haha! Never tried green tea, but I can figure out what it tasted like with your description! 

I don’t know Swiss orange, but orange and chocolate together is good, so that must be good aswell.

We had a orange ice cream here in Canada when I was younger. It was very good. Tried once to do an orange ice cream. Didn’t taste enough to my taste"
1477,"Favorites as an adult: Pistachio, Black Cherry, Mint Chip  
Favorites a kid: Tutti Fruiti, Daiquiri Ice, Rainbow Sherbet  

The strangest flavor was Tamarind. This was ice cream not a sorbet. I really thought it wouldn't work."
1478,"Were you pleased with the tamarind flavour? 
I don’t even know what is it, I’ll have to google it. 

Never had black cherry. Should have some some."
1479,"My top 3: Vanilla, Toffee / Butter Crunch, Cake Batter

Most surprising flavor: Matcha

Strangest flavor: Ben and Jerry’s ‘Late Night Snack’, which had potato chips in it"
1480,"Oh! Damn! Now your talking! 
That’s my kind of ice cream! Will look for it! 

Matcha must be good! 

Cake batter? How?"
1481,"Cake batter ice cream can be prepared in a variety of ways. Some variations of it have actual cake pieces in it as part of the ice cream, though a lot of the time, it’s vanilla ice cream with vanilla cake flavoring."
1482,Mmmm that must be good!  Will have to try this one too!
1483,"Chocolate-licorice, almond-caramel, fresh strawberry."
1484,"Almond caramel, with piece of almond? Or extract ?"
1485,Pieces of roasted almond.
1486,Miam!  Thanks!
1487,"Top 3:

- Coolhaus balsamic fig mascarpone

- Haagen Dazs creme brulee (discontinued; dulche de leche is close but not the same)

- In the 90s Godiva had an amazing white chocolate raspberry ice cream. I’ve tried others but none compare.

Flavor I didn’t think I would like but did: Creamistry has an incredible Capn Crunch flavor. I don’t like Capn Crunch and would have never tried it if they weren’t handing out samples one day. It’s very good.

Weirdest flavor: I thought I would love black sesame but I didn’t like it at all."
1488,"I’ve seen crème brûlé flavour once, can’t remember where it was. Didn’t taste it tho. Will have to try that too, and maybe make it too, crème brûle is my girlfriend favorite dessert. 

Capn crunch is interesting too. Not a huge fan of those  too. More a fan of frosted flake"
1489,"**Top 3**: Realistically my top flavors are all acutely associated with a specific memory. So with that caveat 1) Gelato Messina's pomegranate raspberry brownie - I make my own now (of that exact flavor) and it's my favorite ... but dang nab it nothing compares to that memory. 2) Brandy butter, not because it's the most amazing thing ever, but because it is the perfect encapsulation of childhood Christmas memories, at home with my grandmother, when I now live far far away (in another country). Blueberry citrus - from my friendly semi-local ice cream parlor (and so much better than my attempts), and which we had at our wedding!

**Surprisingly good flavor**: I still remember my first lemon ice cream (not sorbet) as a teenager - it was perfect! (I was never really a fan of 'sour' flavors). Separately, red bean paste (so long as it's smooth not crunch). 

**Weirdest**: Taro (nope!), and durian (ALL THE NOPE!) - they were entirely appropriate for where I was living at the time, but not really my thing :)"
1490,"I have an extract of brandy butter I think. That would be a good thing to try in. Never had this flavour. 
Pomegranate gelato brownies must be a hell of a recipe to make ! And blueberry citrus must be refreshing! 

We had orange ice cream here when I was younger, than is was not “trendy” anymore and companies stopped making them.
Tried once, didn’t taste like the childhood memory! 

Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible"
1491,"> I have an extract of brandy butter I think

I just half a jar of it in my normal custard base :) 

> Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible 

I find durian to be not quite so bad as it's reputation, especially because there are different 'types' of durian, which smell to varying degrees. In ice cream the smell was pretty neutral. But the texture had transferred over too, and that was what really got me. I've had awful luck adapting to the texture of a number of southeast asian desserts (ais kacang ... *shudders*)."
1492,"Half a jar, at least I know what I should aim for :p"
1494,Dark chocolate with peanut butter is very good. I made one the other day!
1495,cookie milk (vanilla base)
1496,Cookie milk? Like milk soaked with cookie ?
1497,yep the milk used in the mix has cookies soaking in it
1498,Mmmmm I definitely will keep that in mind
1499,Do you need to reduce sugar amount since the milk will contain more sugar?
1500,"Favorites: cherry garcia without the chocolate chips (I hate chocolate chips and will pick them out! ), yogurt gelato, mint cookie

I can't really think of anything I thought I would hate but loved, I don't really try anything I think will taste bad.

Strangest would definitely be durian. I had a taster out of curiosity but I couldn't get over the gasoline smell/taste. I haven't had actual durian though so it might have just been the ice cream at that shop."
1501,"Oh god! Durian?? 😱 I would even think about trying it. Never smelled one, never tasted one."
1502,"green tea ice cream is very easy to make, you can get matcha powder at an oriental market and just add it to vanilla"
1503,Asian market... Orientals are rugs.
1504,THANK YOU. I'm sick of people saying oriental and thinking they're being cultural. Phonies
1505,I love green tea ice cream.
1506,They have similarly powdered black tea that makes another variation of typical ice cream flavor quite nicely.
1507,Oh gawd that stuff is so delicious!
1508,Damn. That sounds really good.
1509,Cinnamon ice cream is amazing.
1510,Cinnamon ice cream and chocolate foam is great.
1511,"I haven't made it myself, but a gelato shop near where I used to live made lavender. It was heavenly. It had a delicate flavor, so you would want to serve it as the main dessert and not mix it with brownies or pie or sauce, but I definitely want to recreate it at home."
1512,"We have an ice cream place that makes wild berry lavender and it is yummy. In the summer they make sweet corn and it's also tasty.  
http://www.jenis.com/categories/Flavors/"
1513,"Hmm...those look tasty. None of their scoop shops near us, but it does say some near by grocery stores carry them :)"
1514,"She has a very good book. Her recipes just take a lot of time. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1579654363"
1515,I wish I lived on the west coast where lavender grows rampant. That sounds divine.
1516,I live in chicago and have a very healthy lavender plant growing in front of my house.  Yields a lot of flowers from which I make a lot of lavender simple syrup every year.  It can be done!
1517,"Made this in France with flowers that are just opening, steeped in milk/cream at a fairly low heat for what seemed to me to be a very short time. Then they squeezed the flowers into the batch and I think this is what really makes the difference."
1518,I live in south Florida... it's typically too hot for lavender. I've seen some people do it but items takes a lot of work and doesn't last very long.  I always come back from Portland with a huge Ziploc of it though.
1519,Lavender grows like crazy in my garden... I think this is going to have to go pretty high up on my list of flavors to try making!
1520,"We also have an ice cream place, [Salt & Straw](http://saltandstraw.com/home.php), that makes a honey lavender ice cream, as well as many other unusual yet delicious flavors. Some of my favorites are pear with blue cheese, honey balsamic and cracked-pepper strawberry, and sea salt with caramel ribbons. They also had one this summer that was chevre with marionberry and habanero jam. Mmmmmm."
1521,Brown Bread. I go to a place call Scoops in Los Angeles. They're always making unique flavors which change fairly regularly.
1522,"...like Pumpernickel ice cream? I'd eat that. Might be nice with sweet, caramelized onions on top, too.  

Don't judge, you know I'm right. ;)"
1523,"Purple yam.

My fillipino mother in law introduced me to it. It is fucking delicious... AND PURPLE."
1524,"Taro? I LOVE taro. To me, it tastes the way chocolate chip cookies smell fresh out of the oven."
1525,"Oh Taro is good, my favorite frozen yogurt flavor *by far*."
1526,"I don't know if it's generally called Taro, but in Filipino we call the purple yam ""ube"" (pron. oo-bee)."
1527,I wonder where I can get a purple yam....
1528,i bet it's taro... asian groceries should have them
1529,Red Bean Ice cream is quite good
1530,...like kidney beans?
1531,like azuki beans.
1532,"What's that like? Are the softened, or mashed a bit? Is the ice cream chunky? What other flavors?"
1533,"In the red bean ice cream I've had, they're soft beans mashed up a bit- not chunky at all, though. Azuki beans are sweet, so they make a great tasting ice-cream flavor. There are actually a couple Japanese treats that put azuki beans in pastries, sometimes shaped like fish (not sure why, though)."
1534,I'm not sure actually. I had it once in a Japanese restaurant and it was delicious. The aftertaste was similar to that of coffee ice cream.
1535,Oh yum; I'll see if I can hunt that down.
1536,"Ya, I definitely recommend it!"
1537,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of a tasso ham ice cream I tried.

Personally, I've had textural difficulties with avocado ice cream due to the high fat content, but it works well if you've got a CryoJet.

As for carrot, I haven't had it, but I see no reason it wouldn't work. You could either go in a carrot cake direction or a maple- or honey-glazed direction. Personally, I think I'd either roast them for a more complex flavor, or juice them and make a sorbet."
1538,"Quick google search for CryoJet didn't help me at all. Is this something I need in my life?

The carrot ice cream was one of the first recipes I searched for. It's already sweet, and to roast it or pan fry it before adding it to an ice cream mixture is something that appeals to me. Honey/maple would be nice - but so would caramel. I would eat that. 

How did the tasso ham taste?"
1539,"Sorry, I meant PacoJet. It's a commercial ice cream machine that takes canisters of frozen solid base and makes perfectly smooth ice cream. Saves a lot of the fiddling home ice cream makers have to do to get the right balance of water, sugar, ice, fat and air. On the minus side, it'll set you back $4,000."
1540,"Lol that makes way more sense for me, thanks. 

Yea, most certainly am not at the professional level. Got my ice cream maker for free. It's pretty old and didn't have a manual. Doesn't matter because ice cream.

So, the tasso ham?"
1541,"The tasso ice cream had a lovely balance of savory and sweet with a touch of smoke and a spicy finish. I don't know you'd recognize it as ham flavor if you weren't told, though. It was served with a hot crawfish pie and the contrasting temperatures and texures worked very well."
1542,"Sounds great, actually. My mom has been asking me to make the ""stranger"" flavors, even though they're not really that strange. It's good to know that one worked so well."
1543,"Garlic - courtesy of the Gilroy garlic festival. Had this when I was a kid. The start of my passion for Garlic in general.

http://americanfood.about.com/od/extremeamericancuisine/r/garlicic.htm"
1544,"I had this several years ago-not a strong garlic taste, but it gave you breath that is toxic to small animals.
There are better ways to make ice cream."
1545,I wouldn't have ever imagined.... looks mighty fine. Garlic is beautiful.
1546,I LOVE my recipe for buttered popcorn ice cream. It's delicious when topped with a salted caramel sauce. Mmm.
1547,Recipe yessss???
1548,"It's insanely involved. You have to have ages because you make your own popcorn, butter it, make basically a custard and seep the popcorn in the heated milk, and then make the ice cream. 

It's basically [this](http://almostbourdain.blogspot.com/2010/06/popcorn-ice-cream-with-salted-butter.html) though :)"
1549,Oh my god it sounds heavenly. I'm a sucker for salty sweet anything.
1550,It's really yummy :)
1551,Pisco Sour Ice cream. It's a traditional drink from peru or chile. It's actually xtemly delicius
1552,"Most of the stuff that might be ""weird"" that I've made has been posted, except Pok Pok in Portland has a bourbon coke float, with bourbon ice cream.  I ripped off the recipe.  I make a gelato base with a tsp of vanilla extract.  Once it's cooled I mix in 4 tbsps of bourbon.  I usually use Makers b/c it's sweeter.  And then mix it up.  It's got a nice vanilla/brown sugar/oaky flavor and the coke floats are delicious."
1553,"Ok, number 1, Portland, OR is completely badass so that's that.

2, Do you have the recipe? I know that alcohol doesn't freeze so a lot of the recipes just say to add it in towards the end - is that what yours says?"
1554,"Yeah, I do 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup of sugar and a pinch of salt.
I mix that together in a sauce pan until the milk starts to simmer.
I whip 5 large egg yolks together. When the egg yolks are sufficiently whipped I take the milk mixture off the heat and slowly whip in the egg yolk.  Once the eggs are in I add a tsp to 2 tsps of vanilla extract, I add less usually but if I have a cheaper bourbon I'll add more. 
Then I reheat it until I get a custard. I take it off the heat and stir in a 1/4 cup of bourbon and then I chill it. Once it's chilled I throw it in my ice cream maker.
I never have a problem with it freezing b/c there's not a lot of alcohol in it."
1555,Wasabi... I think it was Sorbet however. Still pretty darn good.
