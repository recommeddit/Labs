53073,It‚Äôs alternative hip-hop. Some songs are definitely heavy on the hip-hop influence
53074,very much so
53076,"Fuck it, this place sucks off death grips and that shit sounds like amplified static and random noises thrown together."
53077,"you are out of your fucking mind if Waitin On Ya, Don't Need You, Gold Chains, Smiling with No Teeth... well, fuck it, 90 percent of the album, sounds like the stuff death grips goes for. your taste must just be basic as hell"
53078,"He's not saying Genesis Owusu is like Death Grips.

He's saying that this subreddit considers DG to be alternative hip hop, and thus Genesis Owusu may as well too."
53079,"I like some death grips but we‚Äôre really
Going to pretend their style/sound isn‚Äôt experimental to the point of being a turnoff for the average person? I‚Äôm just saying this sub praises tons of weird experimental mashups of genres. Where you been?"
53080,Dude literally nothing on that album sounds like death grips other than maybe the first song
53081,"Wasn‚Äôt saying that, just saying that death grips is way more experimental or out there than SWNT and they get praised quite often."
53082,"Absolutely, I keep coming back to it. Might be my favorite of the year"
53083,Man I'm having a hard time keeping up with these new artists. I've been able to do for a long time but I'm losing motivation. I'm 31 btw
53084,Same @ 29. My underground knowledge is about a foot deep.
53085,"It's really hard to keep up. I'm 39 old hip hop head. I feel like I am up on all the new shit every week when it drops, then I read a threadole this, never heard of 90% of the stuff here"
53086,"Man I'm right here with all you guys

Turning 30 this year.

I haven't heard of Any of these rappers.


Went through and made some new wpotify playlist though.

I expect to be disappointed, but we'll see"
53087,PARIS TEXAS
53088,"Man I tried to get into this last week, definitely has some bangers but doesn't quite feel like a cohesive album for me.
I will for sure be keeping an eye on the progress of these boys though, they doin some next level stuff on some tracks."
53089,"Yeah completely agree, I really love Heavy Metal but didn‚Äôt think any of their other songs came close to it. Hope they can match that level on their next project"
53090,HEAVY METAL is a banger
53091,Song of the year for me so far
53092,without a fucking doubt!
53093,That's the joint right there
53094,Bruiser Wolf - Dope Game Stupid
53095,"Nobody sound like this, sound like this..."
53096,They literally don't lmao
53097,Dude sounds like Bryant Gumbel.
53098,"Selling bowls was fine and dandy, but I prefer the white girl like the royal family"
53099,So goddamn good
53100,What is this dr suess delivery bro
53101,He‚Äôs signed to Danny Brown so it‚Äôs not exactly unexpected
53102,Suga Free/E-40 type of shit
53103,With a little Sadat X
53104,"It takes a moment to click, but when it does.."
53105,Imagine playing that on the aux bro..
53106,I feel like this is the type of music that doesn‚Äôt leave your headphones lol
53107,My crowd expects some left field shit every so often.
53108,i can give it a try at 3am when everyone's suitably drunk
53109,I hate this attitude.
53110,nigga asked for good debuts but clearly wanted shit from dudes that are already making music he listens to lmao
53111,Pretty sure it was just a joke
53112,He sounds like a middle aged white dad rapping what he thinks rap sounds like
53113,"Absolutely, man is from the future and the 70s at the same time. Detroit's really carving out a new sound with Bruiser Brigade and their producers. Fat Ray and J.U.S's tapes great too"
53114,Damn there‚Äôs something so captivating about his delivery. It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs trying to sound bad on purpose but he‚Äôs so damn confident. I‚Äôm loving this album. It‚Äôs like mixing E-40 with Dr. Seuss for real lol. Detroit has a unique rap scene for sure.
53115,I mean it‚Äôs dope... don‚Äôt sound bad.. I can see why people find it appealing.. but we gonna act like we don‚Äôt picture Mickey Mouse on the mic? Real talk it ain‚Äôt that bad.
53116,We hearing the same rapper?
53117,You got me listening to Scooby Doo?
53118,How does this album sound so ***classic***?

I ranked them in from best-worst so if you‚Äôre gunna check any out, start from the top. 

Some of these aren‚Äôt official studio debut albums. Some are mixtapes but can be considered breakout projects so I included them anyway."
53121,"it was supposed to drop last month

i think it's coming in 3rd of sepetember now"
53122,Apple music says August 20
53123,Cench‚Äôs album bangs
53124,Love the 24Kgoldn name drop. His album was great and a fun summer vibe.
53125,"I love My Struggle. Temperature is a banger of an opener, My Pain got added to my ‚Äúam I sad or just vibin?‚Äù playlist"
53126,These are certainly debut albums anyway
53127,pooh shiesty blew tf up off his debut album and that shit smacks
53128,Big brrrrrr
53129,Master P is one of my favourite tracks this year
53130,"Unfoonk -  My Struggle 

Debut album from YSL member. Fire front to back, short and sweet and great features"
53131,Unfoonk is dope. That‚Äôs actually Thuggers real brother who was in jail for many years
53132,It‚Äôs Remble for me
53133,"Fuck yeah I never see anyone talk about Remble on here, Ive been bumping his album for the last two weeks.  I just wish watch how you talk to me had another verse."
53134,"my fav was probably [Shiloh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mvb_L6bXUw&list=PLchHt-c_G2EZfvBJYup8WgwfUgbIeDxtz) by John Glacier (female MC, exec produced by Vegyn). honestly surprised i'm the first to mention it (afaict)

gorgeous beats from one of the main producers on Blonde, strong lyrics/vibes/whatever, kinda reminds me of a certain era of Earl Sweatshirt

[Trelawney Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKrCEBdEiMU&list=PLchHt-c_G2EZfvBJYup8WgwfUgbIeDxtz&index=4) is a good song to get a sense of it from"
53188,Cochise - Benbow Crescent
53136,"Mustafa - When Smoke Rises is r&b-ish but pretty incredible. amazing sampha feature and production from frank dukes/jamie xx/james blake/etc         
     
[Capo](https://youtu.be/YMAUJStzrX0) (feat. Sampha)    
     
Nascent - Minus The Bullshit Life‚Äôs Great is an excellent producer album and can‚Äôt recommend it enough. also has one of the dopest art covers in a minute

[Lock It Up](https://youtu.be/DzN0_Kbl5dk) (feat. Saba & Duckwrth)"

53138,"haha for sure, glad to put more people on to him       
     
his [whole production credits list](https://genius.com/artists/Nascent) is pretty crazy tbh, dude produced some of the best brent faiyaz shit and even produced Hurricane by kanye"

Okay, it's a mixtape, but you should check it out!"
53141,"Oh damn, I don't know how I completely missed this coming out. Thanks!

She's gonna be at the 88rising festival and I'm so hyped."
53142,"[Paloma Mami - Sue√±os De Dali](https://youtu.be/PYi2Ef7b3Gk), also my AOTY overall"
53143,"I‚Äôm always down to hear your cool Spanish/Portuguese stuff cause that Monsieur Perin√© was phenomenal.  Paloma smooth as glass off this one song, & I‚Äôm on Goteo rn & Jesus this beat is it, dig.

I always forget how massive the Latin music world is & just it‚Äôs entire own thing."
53144,She‚Äôs got a promising career ahead of her. I was pleasantly surprised at her album- but then she came thru with that Ricky Martin feature? Damn this girls got a dope trajectory
53145,"I really enjoyed ‚ÄúFor Ya‚Äù, ‚ÄùGoteo‚Äù, & ‚ÄúI Love Her‚Äù off her album.  I could definitely see her doing really well w/ the standouts on here.  

For me personally if I could pick, I‚Äôd really wanna hear a lowkey more off-kilter EP from her cause I like a lotta the elements she got.  Those can end up way better than whole albums for me w/ some artists like Ravyn Lenae, who I love & she‚Äôs only released EPs, no debut album yet."
53146,"Damn this was pretty good so far, I needed this vibe rn, gonna listen to the full thing tomorrow but what i heard is amazing"

Part of the same music collective as Jorja Smith. He raps, sings, produces, and directs the music videos for this project. His beat switches are crazy. Quickly becoming one of my favorite rap albums."
53148,Yessss Ultramarine is amazing
53149,"Yoo , cheers. I fucking loved this project and posted it here when it dropped but it got no love. Looks like he‚Äôs been putting in serious studio time with Loyle Carner who is one of my favourite hip hop artists at the moment (check out his two albums if you haven‚Äôt, they‚Äôre fantastic) REALLY excited for whatever they‚Äôve been working on."

It's a dumb comparison but it's quite a bit better than the other Paris-related album I've seen recommended a few times in this thread.
53153,Listened to the first 2 tracks and shit this is fuckin hard. PDA is amazing. Imma check the rest of it out tomorrow. Checked out Paris Texas too and they were also good. Good year to be named Paris ig lmao

53162,"I guess I don't really love hip hop, because I couldn't name a debut album from this year, and the only person I know on the list that got posted is Pooh Shiesty. Yikes."
53163,That‚Äôs exactly why you should just use threads like this to your advantage.
53164,Facts. I‚Äôma catch up.
53165,Man I'm a big hiphop head as you can see from my nickname and other that bruiser Brigade dudes it's my first time hearing these names no üß¢

Annoying ass album. Listen to it again u will get what im saying, i didnt hear it the first 10 times"

53205,Donda
53206,"Have you actually listened to The Score? I mean there are some R&B and Soul songs on it, but that album is very Hip-Hop. I'd say Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a crossover album, but The Score is straight up Hip-Hop with a little bit of other stuff."
53207,"Agreed. Outside of Killin Me Softly, it's straight up hip-hop."
53208,"I've only listened to it a couple times, admittedly, but I definitely got more of a R&B vibe from it."
53209,"Listen again. I mean, it's a lot more soulful than other albums from the 90's, but it's got some of the best rhymes ever. Like listen to Lauryn's verse on [family Business] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZULHO8Z57Y)"

53225,"I am locking this because of the amount of probably well meaning but harmful recommendation based on the highly scientific ""I plugged it in and it worked"" and ""I have plugged it in _dozens_ of times and still nothing is on fire"" tests. We already have enough good and more than enough bad recomendations, I left comments.

There are brands that are very good at the marketing game and because of that many people buy them and then recommend them based on the tests mentioned above. It's much cheaper to play search engines than certify cables. I actively unrecommend ugreen and startech because of this.

In the future as well, unless you have the (very expensive) equipment and knowledge to properly test cables, stick to recommending USB IF certified cables, you can search for them on https://www.usb.org/products"
53227,^ _This_ is the right answer. https://www.usb.org/products
53228,Anker makes quality cables.
53229,Anker for the first spot. Ugreen for second.
53230,See top post https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/ia11ao/is_there_a_better_quality_of_usb_c_cable/g1mq76t/
53231,"Nomad makes theirs with Kevlar.  I have their universal cable and usb-c v Cable with Kevlar, it‚Äôs crazy robust."
53232,I might be giving this one a pass despite it's not USB-IF not certified. There is an Apple MFI certification and five years warranty and it's obvious they care about quality.
53233,Schoshe (I‚Äôm probably spelling that wrong) and Spigen
53234,"Agreed on Schoshe, they are selling certified cables."
53235,"I can attest that UGREEN and CHOETECH are superior brands. These are Chinese brands. Not only for USB-C cables, but also for other items. Here in the Philippines, especially in the Macbook community, when a computer accessory is needed... UGREEN is the go-to shop in Lazada and Shopee."
53236,"I second this. They are comparable to Anker in regards to quality, they most likely won't offer the same support as Anker and Amazon. They are all chinese, and just like every other company they have good and not so good products. So far I've only had good experiences with them."
53237,"> They are comparable to Anker in regards to quality,

Anker powerline is USB IF certified, ugreen is not."
53238,"I have some UGREEN products - very good quality.   I have their lightning to audio jack dongle - way better quality than the Apple product, and is MFi certified too.  Saying that - Anker has not let me down either."
53239,See the top post. https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/ia11ao/is_there_a_better_quality_of_usb_c_cable/g1mq76t/

53241,See the top post instead https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/ia11ao/is_there_a_better_quality_of_usb_c_cable/g1mq76t/
53242,"As for Choetech, they were one of the first brands to bring out a wireless Qi charger with a USB-C port, and soon followed up with a USB-C-to-C version. And brilliantly cheap too. I don't have any other products from them, but that showed me that they keep an eye on the market."
53243,"I have the USB-C to C cable (100w), USB PD 100w charger, USB-C to HDMI dongle, and USB-C to DisplayPort cable and they all work flawlessly!"

53245,AINOPE makes very good cables as well. Been using their braided ones and have yet to fail on me. Design wise they have rubber grommets near the end of the cable so well engineered. Good colors.
53246,"Anker PowerLine II USB-C to C 2.0 Cable (6ft) Probably The World's Most Durable Cable, USB-IF Certified for Galaxy S8, S8+, Google Pixel, Nexus 6P, Huawei Matebook, Nintendo Switch, MacBook and More https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WNXY1R/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_HDLBAbB5KRPY7

Try these."
53247,If you have a pixel DO NOT use these with the USB -C PD charger. They do not charge properly or safely with it according to tests from google devs. Do not. However their USB A to USB C powerline plus are excellent.
53249,It's in the PIXEL subreddit. The pixel devs did a spread sheet rating cables.
53250,I buy the ankers that have a lifetime warranty and just have them replace them when they eventually break. Power line +
53251,"The Google USB-C cables are the best I have by a huge margin. Expensive, but I've been using the ones that came with my Pixel for over a year and they've outlasted several others."
53252,"I have multiple USB-cables from Anker and till now only one of them broke after 4 years of daily use.
Can't imagine it's different with their USB-C cables of which I use 3 on almost a daily basis since a year ago."
53253,"I recently purchased a (less than) $10 Anker microUSB cable, and in glad to see I made the right choice!"
53254,"You could have fluff in the charger port, new cables sometimes fix the issue for abit for some reason, my local phone shop has a tiny and I mean tiny spoon to get it out with."
53255,"This. Turn your phone off and use a needle or safety pin in there, get that pocket lint out."
53256,Just did this to mine with one of those plastic floss/toothpick things amazing how much gunk came out of there. I have had a Nexus 5X since release and the cord still works fine.
53257,Weird is usb-c is pretty solid
53258,"I've honestly had more problem on two phones in the last two years (flagship phones from Google, too) with USBC than I've ever had with microusb. I have a suspicion that the female port needs to be made of harder material now than previously, since a bit of stress will expand it and make it harder for the plug to stay in, which the asymmetric old cables don't suffer from. That, combined with the myriad of different standards that all fit within the same cable had definitely made this generation of cables the most troublesome and confusing"

53260,"my dad got some from a company called cobra cables i think? they seem really solid, pretty expensive for some wire though"
53261,"Apple‚Äôs third-generation 2m USB-C charge cable (rectangular box, not square) is the best in terms of electrical and protocol compliance, but Apple cables have inadequate strain relief because that dilettante Jony Ive prefers pretty to functional."
53263,"TL:DR: if you are rough on your cables, avoid Apple. If you keep having compatibility problems with your cables, use Apple cables."
53264,"I've found this particular cable to be exceptional relative to Apple's other cables.  I haven't been really happy with any of the other USB-C charging cables I've tried, but the Apple cable has been bombproof.

It's worth noting that a laptop power cable isn't typically subject to nearly the same abuse as a phone cable as laptops aren't really moved around that much while charging, and with the detachable cable, wrapping it around the charging brick is no longer a source of strain.  The cable itself is also a bit thicker which helps with strain relief.  

I don't know why you got downvoted so hard here."
53265,"Apple haters, most likely, or Ive-worshippers, not sure which are more annoying.

The assessment on the quality of the cable is not mine, it comes from googlers in Benson Leung's team of volunteer USB-C cable validators:
https://plus.google.com/102612254593917101378/posts/dcLuKzGeeuH

If it took a company with the resources and attention to detail of Apple three tries to get it right, what chance do the others have?"
53266,"Just saying, cables are just little wires wrapped in plastic and sometimes fabric. Just be more careful, imagine playing with a safety pin, bending it back and forth, how many times would you have to bend it for it to break?

If you want an extremely durable cable, you may have to diy. Otherwise, you can just focus on treating your cables like they're fragile wires with little plugs soldered to each end. I haven't had a bad cable in years, and I too once thought I was just dealing with cheaply made cables. 

Again, diy might be an avenue you could explore. Then you could adjust length and thickness to your every desire, and a C to C cable is fairly simple to put together."
53267,"Same with the other comment, if it's user error, do you have an idea for what I should be doing differently? For the most part I use my phone a lot while it's on the charger, but I don't see how that messes up the connecter."
53268,"With pretty limited info on how you use your cables, it's hard to say what to do differently exactly. But, what I do differently from my past is I basically don't use my phone while it's charging. If I need to do something, I'll just unplug it and plug it back in when I'm done. Also, if I do use it while charging, I just do my best to be careful around the end of the cable, no bending of the cable unless it like 4 or so inches away from the end. If the cable is long enough, I'll hold the the cable against the back of the phone in my hand so the bend is like 4-6 inches up the cable, and the end coming out of my phone is straight for at least an inch and a half or so.

There are a bunch of tiny string like wires soldered to individual pins on the plug, if it gets bent next to the plug, eventually the tiny copper just breaks off the pin and the cable is trash unless you resolder. That's the main point you need to be careful of, on both ends of the cable.

Also: I always plug and unplug cables holding the head, never pulling the cable out of my phone by pulling the actual cord, only while holding the end piece."
53269,After some time now I have realized I made some mistakes with how I handled the chargers but the main issue is actually with my charging port. For whatever reason a charger won't make a good connection with my phone where it might for others.
53270,"Do you wrap up cables to ""tidy"" them between uses?"
53271,"Nah, I don't see why I wouldn't just leave it like it is"
53272,"Apple cables really suck, but I never had problems with USB-C cables

If OP wants one, I‚Äôve been using a Phillips one for months and it works super well while being super cheap"
53273,"Are these the first cords you broke so fast, or is this your common experience?"
53274,Common experience

The Powerline II+/III+ are very rugged."
53276,Sounds like user error to me.
53277,So what's the suggestion? What might I be doing that I should stop doing?
53278,Don't bend them and only grab the plug when you pull them out of a socket. Don't press the plug against your body when you lie on the couch with the phone plugged in.
53279,"Hmm?

The two usbc cables I use *most frequently* are still kicking after 6+ months.

As others said, it sounds like user error if the cables die in a month. Also, talk to Anker customer service, they'll take care of it."

53359,"> I am quite torn whether OP is spam

With all due respect, I think my post history speaks adequately to the matter, unless you and I happened to have different definitions of the word ""spam"".

I wouldn't have thought that a post with five different brands listed with target prices, and a nice clean layout, would have been eyed with suspicion. I see now that there are Amazon links on it, which I wouldn't have noticed before but wouldn't have cared about if I had. I also haven't seen this domain before now, linked or otherwise, so I thought there wouldn't be any perception of repeated content being posted from it. I guess I was wrong on two counts?

Going in, I had good opinions about two of the units (Plugable and IOGear), moderately positive about two of them (Cable Matters and Necktek), and no opinion or slight reservations about one of them (Veckle), but those aren't based on personal testing. I was rather hoping the subreddit would have some good feedback. I think I'm moderately more likely to buy one of the Cable Matters cables than I was before reading the list.

I've bought from Monoprice over the last ten years and they're fine, but I'm not particularly attached to the ""Monoprice"" brand (nor the ""Amazon Basics"" branding) and the price spread from ordering directly from East Asia has gone down steadily over the years. If I can get cables that I like better in construction, aesthetics, or brand, for equal or slightly more than Monoprice, I'm currently going to get the others -- assuming they're all compliant with standards and otherwise equal. Speaking of equal, I think the Plugable might have a lower wire gauge, even though I'm overall partial toward the brand."

Seems to use the same number of wires, just differently.

53372,"> Monoprice is a reliable brand

At least they label the bandwidth of the cable, but why do they omit the amperage? 3A/5A would be helpful to have on the connector too.

They mention the AWG size of the data wires I take it? Not the power wires? 30AWG wouldn't be suitable for 3A or 5A afaik, so if they're reliable then the power wires in the cable would be a smaller AWG size(barely any manufacturer seems to bother mentioning them though).

> needs to be mentioned because while hideously expensive, they certainly fill a market niche.

And what is that? They don't even seem to label the cables, just their logo like many others. What's the premium for?

> *Right Angle, Side Angle Connector, Standard Dual and Single Screw Locking connector available*

For those? You can get connectors for such(though probably pointless for the screw locking type). There's also another vendor with magnetic connectors to swap out the connector plugs, allows you to switch the cable from USB-C on one end to micro USB or USB-A."
53373,"> You can get connectors for such

>  There's also another vendor with magnetic connectors to swap out the connector plugs,

Not sure how magnetic connectors got into this, but yes, those exist, mostly non-standard but let's hope the Thundermag works. I haven't seen any other magnetic connector which attempts full USB C compatibility."
53374,"> Maybe you can get the connectors but gen 2 C-C cables ?

What do you mean here? gen2 C-C cable would just plug into the connector for the angled connector for example. I assume that it's pass-through for negotiation on the cables e-marker chip, haven't tried one myself personally, just seen them for sale.

> Not sure how magnetic connectors got into this

For the same reason those expensive cables are being cited as worthwhile for their niche, providing alternative connector styles?

Yeah, anything not providing usb-c connectors is going to be non-standard/non-compliant afaik."

However props to OP for posting, though!"
53376,"In retrospect, the wire gauge or better, the voltage drop as you say, would be excellent to know. And the weight would change based on wire gauge. But modern and higher-speed rated cables are so short today that you might be hard-pressed to see a gram of difference."

53381,"The best way to evaluate voltage drop is not by weighing the cable (as the cable manufacturer could pad the cable with more insulation or stiffer material to make it ""feel"" more premium, while keeping the same crappy thin wires) but to actually measure it.

This is my tool of choice: [https://www.totalphase.com/products/advanced-cable-tester-l2/](https://www.totalphase.com/products/advanced-cable-tester-l2/) 

Unfortunately, it's pricey like a piece of lab equipment. Folks doing this sort of list should probably invest in a lab that does have one though."
53382,"I wasn't intending to suggest estimating the construction through the weight, I was intending to suggest that reviews might measure the weight because travelers might want to know. It's just that the unknown wire gauge also suggested the weight difference."
