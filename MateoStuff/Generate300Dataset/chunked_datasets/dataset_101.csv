32249,"My uncle took his life at the falls last summer. We all thought for months that he had abandoned his car and jumped ( note left in car said only to call police when towed)  Turns out he climbed down to near the base of the falls, made himself comfortable and downed a bottle of benzodiazepines. Parks crew found him when doing a cleanup."
32250,"Worked at the high end restaurant at a ski resort that hosts a famous film festival. 

Lots of sex in the walk in coolers, but never the people you'd want to walk in on"
32251,"I never caught anyone in the walkins, but I always thought the dry storage upstairs would have been a good spot. Now I'm curious who the hell was having sex in the walk ins."
32252,"I had a surgeon come in and complain the microwave in his room wasn‚Äôt working.

Went up to check on it and he showed me how it wouldn‚Äôt turn on.

He opened the door
Put his coffee in
Set the time and hit go

Nothing... he didn‚Äôt shut the door.

They obviously work long days but damn."
32253,"Never trust glass in rooms. GRAs are so stretched thin on time that they will clean the glasses with the same rags they clean the bathroom, after all their goal is to make the room look clean.

I worked as a GRA in a five diamond for years and there was over a year period that went by where we didn‚Äôt get a clean glass delivery. We didn‚Äôt have dishwashers in the room, so management was complicit. This was in a five diamond, one of the top resorts in the world. Never trust glass in hotel rooms."
32254,Suddenly the sealed plastic cups at Holiday Inn seem 5 star to me.
32255,It was your comment that made me realize my dumb ass was thinking windows
32256,"There is a reason we use sealed cups, and it's literally this reason"
32257,That is vile. I guess I'm glad I know.
32258,Gra?
32259,This one got to me the most
32260,"Didn‚Äôt work at one, but delivered newspapers to one. 

The prostitution thing was something the desk saw a lot. The best one was when the gentlemen got robbed by two young ladies and immediately demanded the front desk call the cops. When the desk asked if he wanted to call the cops and tell them he hired two hookers (illegal)... he suddenly just grunted and marched up to his room."
32261,"i worked night audit for awhile, and had one dude call a hooker, enjoy her services, and then refuse to pay her.

she came to me, said she‚Äôd been raped, so i call the cops. dude gets rousted from bed at 3 am to talk to the cops in the lobby.

the whole time she‚Äôs yelling, ‚Äúif you need a dna sample i‚Äôve got some in my mouth,‚Äù the cops are trying to explain to the guy that his options are paying her or going to jail for rape and solicitation, and i‚Äôm trying to use my best customer service skills to keep everyone quiet and gently hint to the dude where the ATM is.

the best part was, this was night 1 of a week-long stay, so i got to see him every day after that."
32262,"So it's basically, ""Pay the hooker, motherfucker"""
32263,">the cops are trying to explain to the guy that his options are paying her or going to jail for rape and solicitation

Lol, even the cops don't care about prostitution."
32264,Paperwork for a rape arrest vs leaving after the guy pays her? You do the math.
32265,"Watching for signs of sex trafficking, lots of cheating spouses there under fake names (and you can‚Äôt confirm if they‚Äôre there when the spouse calls pissed), jacuzzi and swimming pool deaths (usually from alcohol), guests expose themselves to female staff frequently especially housekeepers and room service, people will legit give you keys to their rooms, sometimes dealing with really shitty organizations for their banquets income, etc. 
One cool thing is that you can buy pillows, mattresses, etc from many hotel brands if you really enjoyed your sleep at a hotel.

Edit re: fake names:
You can use an alias at a hotel. You check in with all your correct legal information, so the hotel has all your info. Then you let them know you‚Äôd like to use an alias during your stay and if you‚Äôd like to block external calls. So if a civilian calls looking for you, the desk says you‚Äôre not there per instructions. IF there is an issue of medical/legal/law enforcement then the desk will provide the correct legal info per local laws. This is something also used by people hiding from abusers too, it‚Äôs not always someone being shitty.

32266,"I used to work at a hotel when I was maybe 20 where this man came in with two young women (definitely teens) and never let them speak, they'd come back somewhat bruised. Then he started coming in with other men (and the girls) everything paid in cash.

My manager said ""it happens. Leave it""

A woman told me the next morning she thinks she was raped by the same men. She woke up naked in her room beat up and with pain in her genitals after having drinks with them.
Management again, ""leave it. She's crazy and was drunk""

So I called the police and corporate and left that day.

Detective called me a couple days later for a report and to come in and ID the man (as well as some 'customers' of the man. Turns out the girls were underage and ""not from here"" is all I was told.
Manager was investigated as a participant and fired.

32268,Good on you for not listening to that arsehole manager!. You helped a lot of people that day. You should be proud of yourself. üòÄ
32269,"I stayed at a Marriott one night and it was the best sleep I ever had.  The mattress was fantastic.  Went home and called Marriott to ask what kind of mattress it was and got ‚Äú one moment let me transfer you to our mattress sales department.‚Äù  One surprised frankentriple, 1300 dollars and two weeks later Marriott delivered a king size to my door.   I‚Äôm sure my ex is still sleeping in complete comfort 15 years later."
32270,My parents bought me an $800 mattress and it is so comfortable that I now hate sleeping anywhere else. I can only imagine what $1300 gets you.
32271,"Mattresses can range from the couple hundred dollars to 10k for the most part. And the higher cost doesnt mean better quality. 

I work in furniture repair and go out and do mattress inspections for warranty defects. The average price range would be somewhere around 3k. And that is pretty much middle of the road in the matt world. 

It's a hit and miss world. You would think Tempur-Pedic would be the end all be all of Matt's. It's a love it or absolutely hate it product. No middle ground and its 50/50 whether people like it long term or not. People fall in love with purple in the show room, drop 3k for one and then want it out of their house within a month. 

And I always get the well we spent 5k we thought we wouldn't have any problems and I am like cost doesnt matter its luck of the draw for the most part. You can get the same matt 10 times and 5 out of those 10 times it turns into a shitty matt the other 5 it works out and remains comfortable. 

Just use and remember your warranty."
32272,"There is one Aloft I stay at that has those long tube pillows, one is firm the other is soft. I frickin love those pillows. Each Aloft is different as sometimes the pillows suck"
32273,"When we see 'instagram influencer' on your booking, we roll our eyes."
32274,i think this is pretty universal reaction. i know a person who runs a vegan restaurant and he's often hit by requests to get free food from 'reviewers' and 'social media influencers'. most of them also turn pretty vile when denied and react with threats of smear-campaigning the place etc.
32275,Work at a pizzeria. Had this happen. Free food for his acknowledgement of our pizzeria.  When we said No thank you the threats started coming. POS.
32276,it seems best course of action is to just ignore them completely and hope they continue their mass mailing campaign and forget about you.
32278,"Yeah... as in, the influencer will usually tell us at the time of booking (obviously hoping for free shit) and that note will be added to the booking.
If they are big enough, they'll end up dealing with our sales and marketing team, and probably get complimentary shit. But the staff still couldn't give a shit.
We get genuinely rich and famous people come in, who are the best in their field and, as other people have mentioned, they are usually quiet and the least trouble. Influencers are generally the worst."
32279,Gotta give them the South Park Yelp treatment
32280,"At a certain Beverly Hills hotel, where I valet‚Äôd for a short amount of time, many stars cars are just left there. They come and get them whenever. There was also a code name for Justin Bieber who visited often (I can‚Äôt remember it). He picked it himself. His G-Wagon and a Bentley were just kept down there free of charge. Usher also left his bike there a few years back and has just never collected it."
32281,Lmao I don't know why I find it so funny that Usher just left a bike
32282,go tell him on Twitter he forgot his bike lol
32283,I hope it's an actual bicycle and not a motorcycle. It just seems a lot funnier.
32285,"This was it!! And yes usually the stars were nice as hell. It was always the rich people that I had no idea who they were, that were assholes.

Judge Judy was easily the nicest woman ever. Was also shocked by how tiny of a human being she is lmao."
32286,"Dead people. In some places there's a reasonable chance somebody has died in your bed. Obviously it varies with the type of hotel and its clientele, but some places you get deaths weekly (not that the hotel is unsafe but unfit old people over exerting themselves). One place I worked maybe 40% of the beds had been died in.

Bedbugs. They happen in every hotel. You might be paying $5k a night but your luggage was in the hold with everyone else's. If there's only one or two bugs and none in the adjacent rooms (diamond style, so above, below, and both sides) then you brought them in. 


You know what I never saw happen? Maids stealing. Everyone always points at the maids when they lose stuff but we always found it. No way the maids are risking their jobs over your used iPad or mall jewelry. With tips they make pretty decent money."
32287,"Tip about bedbugs: when you arrive NEVER put your luggage on the bed.  When you arrive, keep lights off, put luggage in bathroom, and then at the head of the mattress peel back the sheets and mattress pad.   Bedbugs tend to congregate there, but scatter when there is light.  If you find bedbugs, you can request another room."
32288,">...you can request another room.

Or another hotel."
32289,coke. lots of coke.
32290,"If it wasn't so bad for me, I'd drink it every day."
32291,"I went and had a drink with a couple buddies for the first time in a long time a couple weeks ago.

My friend looking at his phone ""Other dude we know says he just got here and it's snowing out front if anyone's interested.""

Me ""So what? It just snowed like last week.""

I don't get out much even before covid..."
32292,"First week of university we had a mixer for our dorm for everyone to get to know each other, I ended up talking to a guy and he asked me if I liked to ride the white pony, in all seriousness I responded, ""I mean, I've ridden horses before but I don't remember if they were white or not."" Sketchy dude got freaked out and walked away. Thankfully a buddy I grew up with was there to explain that he was trying to sell me coke."
32293,"lol. I‚Äôve learned that if some one asks me if I want something weird, to say no. I‚Äôve been asked if I wanted fire, smack, loud, some good stuff. I eventually worked out what all of them were except fire, so if someone could explain that one, I would appreciate it."
32294,Sounds like that dude was trying to sell you his mixed tape.
32295,I‚Äôm still glad I said no.
32296,"Lmao I have so many stories and honestly I want to write a memoir about it.

We legit had someone once break into the archive room and steal everyone‚Äôs credit card details. Nobody noticed until like a month later. Was a shit show.

I‚Äôve had to deal with people throwing the furniture off balconies and throw on to other guests cars.

Sadly a lot of DV incidents. Hospitalisations. People killing themselves. Undercover cops looking at CCTV for high end criminals?

And don‚Äôt even get me started on how ‚Äòclean‚Äô those rooms are. Your $1000/night does not reflect those standards. They still wash them tea cups in the bathroom sink or the bath tub.

Lastly, I‚Äôm an Australian and was working in the US for a while in this fancy 5 star resort (front line position working holiday) and what management really didn‚Äôt want you to know is how little they paid us. 
At home I could survive on our Australian minimum wage - but had no chance in the US of surviving on theirs (we weren‚Äôt allowed to accept tips at this particular company üôÑ)

There‚Äôs a reason for high turnover in hospitality I guess"
32297,"I worked at a 5 star hotel in England as a bartender. Hosted events and stuff. One thing that was common was my manager would just spam extra drinks onto the bill at events to make more money. Or for example if a big wedding ordered 50 bottles of champagne, they‚Äôd only give them 30 and would keep 20 back and if they ran out, they‚Äôd have to buy more. I reported this to Senior management and they just laughed saying it‚Äôs normal. I actually got told off for not taking part in this."
32298,"Did maintenance at some hotels as pure grunt labor.

People will flush anything down a toilet.

Towels, sheets, giant shits that no human could have possibly downloaded, pillows, paper, food, bottles, and just abkut everything else.

Best one ever, got a call to snake a toilet in a room.  Twitchy Latin guy tells me it is *super* important I be careful to not damage said flushed item.  Gotcha.  I managed to fish out his bags of various powders and pills out without breaking a single bag open.  He offered me some product as a tip, and when I declined, just handed me a stack of $20s and ushered me out the door.  It was an $1,800 tip.

Oh, and ladies, tampons and pads do *NOT* get flushed down the toilet.

And for everyone else, flushable wipes, aren't."
32299,What goes on the room next to you.   This week we to evict and have arrested a couple for causing over $15K in damages to a room.  This was done quietly late at night and the nearby rooms never found out.
32300,"I can't think of a way I could casually cause $15K in damages in a night without being noisy.

Were they doing it maliciously just to cause damage?"
32301,They touched the mini fridge
32302,That's like four Toblerones and a bottle of Evian!
32303,If you're sneaky you could quietly pull up the carpet and then just paint the entire room with diarrhea.
32304,Seems odd to protect the carpet from paint splatter in this situation.
32305,"This wasn't a 5 star by any stretch, but while in training to install kitchen cabinets for this one company they put the majority of people up in a hotel. This one day we got all our tools to use on the job, chop saw, drills, table saw, etc, etc, etc. This hotel gave one  free beer per person, and these guys from training were getting a LOT more than one beer. That night they decide to take apart all the furniture in the room, and install it on the roof.

The company was hit with that bill of course. They were not amused. They also changed how/when they gave out tools as well."
32306,That's how you prevent later groups from getting the free beer.
32307,"The scale.

Management wants things to be automatic for you. A person there when you need them and every item you could need, before you need it. But the *scale* of that is purposefully hidden.

For example, You see your housekeeper. 

You might see that there are 5 other Housekeepers on that floor, a Houseman per floor and a Special Request Delivery person, if you look closely.

You don't see the 4-6 desk workers manning the radios so that we know when to enter certain rooms, who wants special pillows, how we manage the 3 rooms that all want service at 1PM or replacing rooms that asked for no service.

You don't see the 6 supervisors spot checking check out rooms for cleanliness. Nor do you see the laundry teams, plural. (Sheets and Guest Laundry are separate, and Guest is split into Dry Cleaning and Non Dry Clean) You might see the public Parlor attendants, but you probably won't see the team cleaning the pool or deep cleaning the gym sauna.

At 7:30AM every morning, the service area just *explodes* with activity, like you kicked two ant nests at once. 60 housekeepers on a single shift? Guess it's a slow day.

***And that's just housekeeping.*** 

We have three industrial scale kitchens for various purposes! Four if you count pastries! Security teams! Contact companies for large events! Teams of engineers in every specialty. *I don't even know where the IT office is, but we do have one!* I'm one of the more knowledgeable on where to find items for special requests and I still find new storage rooms every other week. We found a 1930's printing press nobody knew we had!

Its fucking *wild* how many moving parts there are. Flipping 500 rooms in a day while setting up for 2 $1,000,000 wedding simultaneously. Fulfilling 100 Room Service Orders while catering those weddings while running our restaraunt. Fixing a leaky shower head in the pool while ensuring a Guest had an extra couch in their room for the kid that just loves couch beds. All of this together is called ""An average Tuesday in Summer."""
32308,You work in the fucking Grand Budapest Hotel or something?
32310,"This reads like a hotel-management montage early in an *Ocean‚Äôs* movie‚Äîcomplete with Brad Pitt voiceover.

EDIT: Thanks for the unexpected rewards on my late-night/early-morning nonsense, lol. The reason I said this specifically is because Brad Pitt‚Äôs character manages a hotel in at least the first one of those movies‚Äîand that franchise loves its narrated montage."
32311,"I worked in a Major Vegas Hotel as the Senior Hotel Manager. I‚Äôve seen it all. A few things you wouldn‚Äôt know:

-	Every hotel has bed bugs at some point. It‚Äôs not the hotels fault, we noticed international travelers tend to bring them. Probably because they‚Äôre staying at multiple hotels per trip. You can even get them from the airplane. To check for bedbugs just inspect each layer of the sheets, under the pillows and mattress. They look like tiny roaches. If you see blood spots on the sheets the next morning that‚Äôs usually a sign you have been bitten, but the bites can sometimes take a few days to show or get noticed. 
-	Checking in late at night sometimes means free upgrades or discounted upgrade rates. We would try to sell every last suite at night for almost 80% off. We just wanted something, so they don‚Äôt go unoccupied. Sometime if we were over sold on rooms, the late late arrivals (midnight) would get a free suite upgrade because we had no choice. Of course this could also backfire if the hotel is sold out. You may get downgraded for being a late late arrival. 
-	When you complain, the nicest, more understanding guest gets the better compensation, the rude guest gets bare minimum. Always treat the staff with respect and be friendly, you‚Äôd be surprised the number of people who are rude. Even for the smallest of issues."
32312,"That those balls of butter come premade, frozen in a plastic tub"
32313,I hand scooped those delicate looking little bastards at my hotel. Actually it was an enjoyable task. Much better than polishing silver!
32314,"""What's my job?""

""You scoop butter.""

""Oh my g- It's not that bad actually."""
32315,"DUDE.

I was at a hawaiian hotel luau where they served rolls with those butter balls. I'm first in line looking at the food labels first, then the food. Then I see some puffed up name for rolls like ""Hawaiian Super Rolls"" or something. Next to the label were the little butter balls. I'm thinking ""OH SWEET! Some sorta tiny, fancy, shiny rolls. All about it."" And I grab like 10.

Then one of the hosts sees and exclaims, ""Ohhh, BUTTER MAN!!"" and then I look up and see some basic rolls in a basket just next to me. Fuck. I'm already 10 butters in and only want 1 real roll. I can't put them back, I can't let him know I'm am idiot. Gotta let him believe I'm eating just as much butter as bread my whole life."
32316,"At my cousins wedding they had the butter balls with rolls and one of my aunts thought it was ice cream so she took a HUGE bite out of one of them without realizing it was butter. She was so embarrassed when she realized it and just said ""Oh I just really love butter!"""
32317,"Lol. A friend of mine did the same thing at a fundraiser buffet dinner. He saw a bowl of what he thought was potato salad. He scooped up a bunch onto his plate... because he LOOOOVES potato salad. By the time he get back to his seat, half of it had melted onto his steak and vegetables. He could barely eat any."
32318,"Was at a bubba gumps somewhere with a whole lot of drunken bastards.  I was on DD duty so was the sober interpreter for the evening.  

Bubba Gumps has these signs on the table that say run Forrest run.  And stop Forrest stop or something similar.  If you have run the wait staff leave you alone.  If you have stop the check what you need.  There were a lot of very attractive waitresses and the drunk bastards decided when they saw each to flip the sign to stop.  

One comes by.  And stop sign goes up.  ‚ÄúWhat would you like.‚Äù   ‚ÄúButter please ‚Äú.  She brings back butter.  

Another comes by.  Stop sign.  ‚ÄúWhat you need‚Äù.  ‚ÄúButter please ‚Äú.  

And again, and again.  

I am laughing my ass off each time as none of these guys realizes that they keep asking for the same thing.  

Eventually one comes to the stop sign and asks ‚Äúwhat do you need?‚Äù   ‚ÄúButter please‚Äù. 

She looks at me.  Looks at the table.  Looks at them.  And back at me.  I shake my head in apology. 

She proceeds to count little containers of butter already sitting on the table.  Slowly and loudly.  ‚ÄúOne, two, three, four, ‚Ä¶., all the way to seventeen.‚Äù   All completely full and untouched.  

‚ÄúAnd you need more butter?‚Äù   

Drunkest guy mutters ‚Äúyes please!‚Äù   

She shakes her head and walks off.   

And that is how I witnessed a table full of drunks being cut off of butter but not booze."

32320,"We don‚Äôt bat an eye at prostitution or whatever goes on in the rooms as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect other guests. Half the women that come to the bar are working girls looking for a sale. The only thing that the hotel industry ever really reports is human trafficking. There are tell tale signs and if something doesn‚Äôt add up we do report it to local authorities. 

I don‚Äôt know about all 5* hotels but I‚Äôm sure this happens at most of them. Front desk/reservation staff will basically stalk you online if you‚Äôre a notable VIP and your picture will be shared internally to ensure everyone recognizes you so you feel special when you arrive and everyone already knows who you are."
32322,"I didn‚Äôt work at a 5-star hotel, but it was a mid-range hotel that catered mostly to businesspeople.

the worst, though, was the couple that wanted a home birth but not, you know, at home (because gross). we had to deal with that hazmat situation. fucked them as hard as we could with penalties and fees, though."

32327,"A place I worked at roughly 20 years ago, had that popcorn texture shit on the roof. We were notionally a 5 star hotel - but that always felt like a fucking stretch.

I remember some guy killed himself with a shotgun under his chin in one of out bigger suites, and painted the popcorn. A couple of people from housekeeping straight up quit rather than deal with it when management tried to bully them into cleaning blood and brain matter off a popcorn ceiling.

One guy from maintenance said he'd do it, but he wanted a promotion and a 5 year contract with a payout in the event of early dismissal. There was an argument about it and it was like 3 days of calling around getting quotes and arguing with lawyers about if they could give him that contract before they gave in. The smell was getting complaints from the entire floor. 

Dude did the whole cleanup with a pair of drywall ceiling stilts. Got the promotion and the contract. That shit can't have been legal, even then. But management didn't want the fuss of a hazmat crew or crime scene cleanup going through the hotel.

I left a few months after that, but I heard a few years later from a former coworker that they had an incident and fired all of housekeeping and maintenance. Except for that guy. He was the only person to survive the purge."

Shit is so sad, their moms would call later in the week asking if they were alright... My grandpa would have to call my uncles in to help clean the aftermath, which was mainly bodily fluids sprayed all over the walls. They never said whether they changed the mattresses or not, but with all the maggots and decomposing flesh they would find I‚Äôm sure they had to.

32334,"I follow a crime scene cleaning company on YouTube (it‚Äôs very gross but super fascinating) and I think it depends how long the person(s) have been dead for. The more dead/decomposed you are, the more you‚Äôre going to leak (sorry) through the surface you‚Äôve died on. Often they have to dismantle mattresses, box springs, take up carpet, etc. They destroy anything with biohazardous material on it, essentially. But it‚Äôs hard to say what hotels would do lol.

The gate was being replaced, and I almost got run over with how many people refused to stop so I could check their sticker.

Many times I got the ""Don't you know who I am"", but I never knew who they were."
32338,I never was but had friends who did valet in college and this sounds very familiar.
32339,I don't understand the bright idea of being an asshole to a guy your about to hand your expensive car over to.  Not something a windrunner would do.
32340,"Not a 5 star hotel, but I worked at a Hilton in Seattle and we had a furry convention

One of the cats pooped in the elevator"
32341,"I use to work events at hotels and one time we had a guest break their wine glass inside a water refill barrel ... I left work for two weeks to go on vacation and when I came back, all the glass was still piled inside the water refill barrel. People must have been drinking out of it because there were events booked while I was gone"
32342,What is a water refill barrel and how would someone break a glass inside it?
32343,"I'm honestly shocked at this story. I used to work as a bartender for the shrewdest asshole I've ever met. He would bring in international kids as servers and charge them $50 a day to live on premises; you never got time and a half, he'd just switch to paying you under the table instead. The assistant manager uh... estimated our taxes. Point is, he wasn't afraid of breaking the law in the slightest.

One day I broke a glass in the general vicinity of the ice machine and he _immediately_ whipped around and started questioning me, ""How close was it? Are you sure the lid was closed? Are you _absolutely sure_ nothing got in the ice?"" The lid was closed, but we were ready to close the entire bar just to clean out the ice machine, all from someone who wanted the cooks to charge themselves if they made food to eat after their shift. You do _not_ fuck with glass in people's food, just one incident can shut down an entire restaurant"
32344,To be fair if I was doing all of that I'd also do my best to avoid any legal attention.
32345,"I'm recalling the scene where Walter White is busting balls about getting the RV  fixed, and everything up to code so they don't end up in prison over a bad tail-light."
32346,"I worked in security for one and housekeeping called us all the time for drugs they‚Äôd find in a room. The first thing we‚Äôd ask for is the room number and we‚Äôd look up the name of the guest. If it was a VIP or someone important to us we‚Äôd tell them to leave it there and ‚Äúwe‚Äôd take care of it.‚Äù 

If the guest was someone we didn‚Äôt know and not important to us we‚Äôd go up there and take it out of the room, then threaten to evict them from their stay if they did it again.

The clues/hints we would use:
-what‚Äôs their status tier? Diamond members almost always got a pass 
-how did they book the room? If it was a 3rd party like Expedia‚Ä¶no pass
-how many times had they stayed at our specific property? 5 or more‚Ä¶pass
-how much had they charged up? If they were spending money on property outside of the room rate‚Ä¶pass

Basically you could have cocaine in your room if you spent enough money."
32347,"Just reading this thread it seems that everyone universally looks down upon third party reservations. Every single time I've tried to book direct on a hotel's website, it's always way more expensive, sometimes unbelievably so. All the third party websites give me cheaper rates basically 100% of the time. Any idea why this is? I've heard that booking direct is better but never done it because of how much more expensive it is."
32348,"Key is to sign up for a (free) membership account with that chain.  Even if you don't have a fancy ""status"", just handing over your personal details unlocks the magical ""members booking direct"" rates, with other perks like free cancellation, no deposit required, etc."
32349,"I wrote travel guides to places in the Middle East (Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, etc) and have stayed in lots of five star hotels around the world for work. 

THe whole five-star system is murky from the start.

The manager at a top-class London hotel told me that the hotel grading system in general is ‚Äúutter nonsense‚Äù. The problem, he said, is that the list of criteria to reach each of the star ratings is little more than a tick sheet, albeit with around 500 factors to consider. For example, one criterion for being considered five-star is fresh flowers being present in guest rooms, but there‚Äôs a huge difference between a big ornate display of orchids and a bunch of daffodils. The presence of either would technically tick the box and in theory you could fulfill all the required five-star criteria yet be hugely inferior to the hotel next door that offers all the same things but at a much higher quality and standard.

The Forbes Travel Guide gave just six London hotels a five-star rating (including the one my insider works at) but that means that fantastic hotels like The Ritz, The Langham, The Berkeley, and Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park are ‚Äúonly‚Äù four star. Are they really 20 percent inferior to the five-star-rated Al Bustan Rotana in Garhoud in Dubai which is basically a business hotel near the airport?

It‚Äôs also difficult to maintain a consistent roll-call of criteria, as modern demands change. For example, Wi-Fi in the room is a relatively recent expectation and what we expect as standard has changed over the years, so what constitutes luxury now has altered accordingly. When Savoy Hotel in London opened 1889 it was boasting about features such as electric lifts, ‚Äúspeaking tubes‚Äù to link each floor, and fully plumbed bathrooms.

Now though, in the era of Internet, crowd sourcing is often the most reliable way to judge somewhere. When hundreds of people on sites like TripAdvisor say a place is overpriced and terrible then it doesn‚Äôt matter what the official book says. And if a one-star hotel gets nothing but praise from 90 percent of the people commenting? There‚Äôs your consensus of rating right there."
32350,Very interesting!

This, absolutely. Now it's the five star reviews that actually count."
32352,"LOTS of prostitution and all the drama/legal trouble that goes along with it. Corporate functions like conventions, parties, etc where there's an open bar almost always leads to something fucked up happening. One hotel I worked at hosted a Christmas party for an investment firm and two guys started jockeying for the affections of a female coworker. They all wound up on an elevator together and the guys started fighting, the elevator went in to safety lock down, we had to call the PD and the FD. One guy went in a squad car, one guy went in an ambulance, we had to give the woman some clothes from lost & found because he dress was covered in blood and the elevator was out of service for six hours to clean it up.
There's always a ton of back of house drama, too. Especially among the execs and the junior managers. Affairs, backstabbing, a little light fraud. You know, the usual."
32353,Yeah i‚Äôd like two packs of ‚ÄúLight fraud‚Äù please...
32354,"Yeah can I get a bottle of Fraud Light, i'm trying to cut back."
32355,Two men enter... One man leaves.
32356,I really thought the elevator story was going to go a different route.
32357,"Was in room service. If someone buys a bottle of booze and doesn‚Äôt open it (e.g. they leave it out for us to take), policy is to bring it back to the kitchen to put into inventory to be resold. A coworker shared that the record, as far as they knew, was one bottle of champagne that was re-sold 7 times"
32358,"I don't work in one anymore, but used to. This isn't really shenanigans, but: the staff is not nearly so impressed by famous or rich people as some of them seemed to think we should be. It was a fancy hotel. We had rich and famous guests all the time. And it was usually the ones nowhere near the top of the ladder who tried to be the most imperious and expected the most deference. If you have to try to convince us you're high status, you aren't. We'd provide polite, professional service for all our guests and try to be helpful and accommodating, but being a C-list actor or whatever isn't going to get you a table in a full restaurant or an upgrade to the already-occupied fancier suites. And if there's a severe blizzard and the airport is closed, we can't open it for you because you're too special to have to wait to fly out. Even if you're a Very Important Businessman."
32359,"Can confirm this. The truly rich and famous are in fact rarely ever the ones who make a fuss of their status and can be some of the most polite and sensible ones. It's the influencers who are clawing for deference. This was a few years back but of the many stars who have stayed at one of my hotels,, the most memorable was Lady Gaga. 

When fans found out where she was staying they flocked over to the hotel hoping for a glimpse of her or to get her autograph, but as you can imagine when the crowd gets too big it can cause operational headaches. Gaga was very aware of this and took initiative to manage her little monsters, as she calls them. She tweeted and asked her fans to be good and kept them under control. Even ordered pizza from the hotel kitchen for all of them waiting outside in the driveway. We couldn't have asked for a more considerate guest of her stature. In the words of my GM (general manager) she is ""incredibly switched on""."
32360,"I can also confirm. I used to work at restaurant inside a hotel that's had a lot of famous people stay in (Tony Hawk, Adam Sandler, Jonas Brother, Justin Bieber, various olympic athletes, etc.) They all went went out of their way to keep a low profile. Channing Tatum was particularly chill.  

I never came across any influencers but the upper middle class families were always the worst to deal with."
32361,Are you sure it wasn't a guy that just looked like Tony Hawk?
32362,Maybe he had a similar surname to that guy who made that skating video game?
32363,"I found while working in one of the higher end hotels in my city that the really famous people don't want attention. At all. They don't want room service, or staff hanging around. Even the welcoming group of the GM and friends is a bit much, just go away and let them be alone. 9/10 times you would just hear video games or a movie from the room. They just want their alone time.

It's the D list celebs who know damn well they're not all that, that demand the attention. Likely to prove to themselves that see, they are important.

And dont even start on people whose biggest claim to fame involves ""twitter"", ""Instagram"" or ""influencer"". God damn parasites who expect to be treated like billionaires but not cough up a single cent."
32364,"There‚Äôs a sign at a relatively hip burger shop near me that says something like ‚Äúinfluencers don‚Äôt get free food and if you mention your social media status during an order we add a 10% surcharge‚Äù.

Didn't matter, I still didn't recognize him and after a while it seemed like this really disappointed him"
32367,Rogelio de la Vega!!
32368,"God I love that man. And the actor, too, I guess."
32369,I totally heard that in his dramatic voice too.
32370,"I once sat next to this nice, older guy on an airplane, we chatted about all sorts of mundane things for the whole 4 hour flight. After we got off the plane, my friend who had been sitting across the aisle asked me what we had talked about, since apparently the guy was a somewhat famous actor, although I still don't remember his name or what we talked about. A nice dude, and I got the feeling he probably preferred sitting next to me instead of my friend, who probably would have had all sorts of questions about his films. :)"
32371,I can relate. Last century I was sitting in a hospital waiting room in London waiting to get my travel shots. They were running behind so I started talking the old guy next to me. I was headed to Egypt. He drew a map and started telling me all the best places to check out over there. We spoke for half an hour before he was called in for his shots. When he left the nurse came over and said do you realise you've been talking to Richard Harris? I had seen most of his movies but had no idea. He was a really nice friendly guy.
32372,The original Dumbledore!
32373,He would have nailed that Goblet of Fire scene.
32375,"One of my college professors gamely told us his I'm-a-doofus airplane seatmate story. This seatmate was having a little mobility trouble and asked for a hand putting away his carry-on, a black hard-sided case. Chit-chat ensued: ""Oh, is that a musical instrument?"" ""Yes."" ""Music's so great. I play a little piano myself. What do you play?"" ""Fiddle.""

Guy didn't seem too chatty, so he kind of let it drop. Kind of had that ""wait a minute, my seatmate looks kind of familiar"" sense but it wasn't until he'd seen him walk off the plane on crutches that he recognized Itzhak Perlman."
32376,"I worked for a very wealthy man. and he didn't get any attention because the entourage of staff made sure everything was all ready to go, everywhere he went, before he even stepped of his Falcon7X.  To the outside looking in he's just some older grey haired shuffling through."
32377,"I worked with a lot of wrestlers over the years and it was funny how the legit mainstream famous ones like Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan, Sting, Undertaker, Macho Man and Rock were the most kind, patient, humble and genuinely nice people.

The middle of the card guys and the flash in the pan wrestlers were always the most arrogant, obnoxious and rude.

Must be a theme in life."
32378,"I was on a Southwest Airplane late at night coming out of ABQ to LAX. This big guy ignored the entire empty plane, sat next to me (F, blond) and started chatting away. I figured he was a contractor or something of the kind. We had a grand time until people started to come to our row asking for his autograph. Confused I asked him who he was and what he did? He said his name was Steve. Said he was a wrestler. I said, ""Alligators""? And then I made a bad joke about speedos. He seemed embarrassed.

I had no idea who he was or why he might have people wanting his autograph. I have never followed wrestling. When we landed he walked me to the carousel, teased the heck out of me and wanted to drop me at my home in his limo. I declined.

We were walking to the curb together when my ride called. I, still joking around told her what was going on with my new best pal and she suddenly blurted out: STONE COLD STEVE AUSTiN?!! I turned around, cocked my head, squinted at him and asked him if the words ""Stone Cold"" meant anything to him? He started  making excuses about ""entertainment...yadda yadda yadda"". Yeah. Nicest guy ever. I had to look him up when I got home. Gave me a good laugh. My friend who picked me up from the plane never let me hear the end of it."
32379,"I'm sure he was enjoying you not knowing who he was, probably wanted to see how long it would last"
32380,Lol amazing. Stone Cold always seemed like the talkative type.
32381,"Used to work in one as well

Would often get famous guests trying to break the rules because it was convenient for them or because their children wanted it 

I don‚Äôt care who you are, rules are rules, if we say no open flames in an area, we fucking mean it"
32382,"Had this happen before, the restaurant was booked for a private event and this guy felt he can do anything he wants. The chef was working on some stuff food projects and this guy went into the back opened it up and ate it. when i confronted the guy, he  kept on throwing out that he's the nephew of a famous actor, and i kept on asking him and who are you? but i don't think he got it that he's a nobody not his uncle."
32383,"I am a subcontractor that works in the It business and the W hotel in Miami beach has seen some shit. 
One day I come in to work and there is a big scramble at the upper floors( that is were the penthouse are)
Seems this kinda known millionaire, had a little too much coke and god knows what else and was destroying the room. 
He was actually throwing furniture out the balcony, ripped everything out of the fridge, might of even thrown a mattress out the balcony.
It was a big deal at the time but they keep it hush with no police involved, a guy that‚Äôs paying 9k-13k a night is not going to be arrested. When the team finally got into the room, there was cocaine all over the tables, bottles everywhere, and a couple of high class call girls that were in true fear.
Next day they book the same room to Jennifer Lopez."
32384,Might this millionaire be a professional athlete?
32385,"Quite possibly, the Obamas stay there, Serena Williams has her own suite next to the tenis courts when she comes. It is an amazing hotel, but you def get to see the other side of the rich and famous."
32386,"As part of our training as bellman we are to ask open ended questions to the children to make sure they aren't being used for sex trafficking when bringing in luggage to ""Dad and daughter"" types. My dad works in security in the same hotel so he often gives me a heads up if the guest with the child is already under suspicion regarding their behavior at the front desk for check in. 
It rarely happens but hotels are the breeding grounds for sex traffickers.

This blew up! Thank you for the rewards to those that found my insight helpful. 

The questions vary depending amount of information security and the front desk tells the crew. 

Has this guest ever stayed with us or any other of our different umbrella hotels? 

What events are currently going on in the hotel? 
Was the child uncomfortable upon entry? (Looking down, crying, silent, dirty clothing). 

Lines of questions try to get the child to speak in general, as many traffickers take in children that don't speak English. 
Otherwise questions about their stay get directed at the child instead of the guardian. 
""What adventures are you guys up to here in Chicago?""
""Is your DAD here on business?""
We crouch and say if they would like to help the bellman work. Most kids love the experience. We usually crouch down and try to make eye contact. 
If I can't definitively tell security that the child is 100% comfortable in their surrounding, or if the guardian tries to lead the child away from me deliberately security gets an internal investigation going.

My dad has given me confirmations of arrests made of guests that I had attended to. Summer is a hectic season, and it happens more than you would like."
32387,"That‚Äôs so sad to hear,  but I‚Äôm glad to hear hotel staff at your place have training to look for signs of sex trafficking."
32388,"airline employee's too.

back when I worked at the airport prior to covid; it was a thing that we had to be on the look out for.

Edit.

Holy crap, I did not expect this to blow up the way that it did."
32389,Us hairdressers in my state couldn‚Äôt renew their license without taking a sex trafficking course.
32390,What kind of open ended questions? I don‚Äôt really understand what you mean.
32391,"Probably things like, ""What are you guys in town for?"" instead of yes-or-no questions like, ""You two in town for the gymnastics competition up the road?""

The latter just provides an easy cover story FOR a bad guy. The first has answers that can beg more questions and thus stress a cover story."
32392,"I'm mixed race and significantly lighter-skinned than my father. I once went with him to a really fancy hotel and the bellman on the way up was asking me a shitload of questions... but like about pokemon (this would've been at the height of ""pokemania"" in the mid-late 90's). I wonder if he was trying to suss out if I was being trafficked or if he was just a Gen X dude who was unusually into pokemon."
32393,My family friend (white) adopted a girl from China with his wife years ago and shes now in her mid-teens & he says it's so exhausting being side eyed constantly for taking his daughter to hotels during hockey tournaments.
32394,"I went with my stepfather to Singapore when I was 12. We look absolutely nothing alike and have different surnames, but he was there for work reasons and I was invited to come along instead of my mother because I was really interested in East Asian history at the time and had never been further away from my home country of the UK than Italy.

Even through the relevantly innocent eyes of a 12 year old girl it was clear that they thought this foreign musician had brought along some little girl to have sex with, to the extent that the hotel staff smiled knowlingingly and arranged us a very nice double bed rather than the twin beds he'd asked for.

Everywhere we went staff would ask about our relationship, and then nod in a your-secret-is-safe-with-me manner when he explained that I was his stepdaughter. And we were, literally, doing nothing more unusual than going to known tourist hotspots or him dropping me off at the local mall so I could buy pirated computer games (ahhhh... 1992).

It drew my attention so asked him about it when we got home. Apparently he'd been repeatedly asked to prove that he knew me and for details regarding my passport when I wasn't there. On a couple of occasions really nice ladies who worked at the hotel would ask if I needed anything or to use a phone and I, oblivious, as I was, was just like ""oh, no thanks!"" 

It's nice to know that people were looking out for me in case the OTHER thing was happening.

I can imagine those people have seen some bad shit going on in their hotel."
32395,This made me re-analyze the trip I took to Vegas  with my dad when I was 14. Hotel employee asked me a bunch of questions too...whoops lmao
32396,this thread makes me want to invest in an RV
32397,"Aah, I have a few from my 20s. 

There was a natural disaster which required staff to stay on site with a floor to themselves. Bathtubs were filled with ice and booze and managers were found wandering backhalls in their undies. 

Michelin chef and F&B manager caught on camera cheating on their partners in a stairwell. 

Leaders of [redacted] in town for global governmental meetings, eating chicken in the lobby and throwing the bones on the floor. 

My friend was the GM of one of one of the most famous high-end hotels in America, and shared a story about a resident of their penthouses having a mental breakdown, destroying everything, ripping the sink off the wall, and sprinting down the hallway naked and getting tackled by security. His neighbors include CEOs of Fortune 50s. 

The reasons the prices are so high isn't the rent, we owned the building. Bought it from a failed casino owner turned political leader for pennies. The prices were influenced first by extremely high payroll, then quality, then profit.

Edit:
Also, people die in hotels all the time. Age, stress, whatever. It's not uncommon to get calls from concerned spouses, do a wellness check, and oof. They're rolled out the back during quiet hours. 

There's a decent amount of theft internally, but the workers all protect and cover for each other, and turn on managers that catch them.

These major established properties, the staff is pretty akin to the Mafia. They make things happen. 

Not as much drug use as others mentioned at ours. A lot of the f&b staff was past their 20s."
32398,I think Sandals is mostly geared towards couples and might not be the best fit for a girls trip depending on the vibe you're going for.
32399,Good point! A lot of their marketing seems very romantic.
32400,How many people are on your group? When are you thinking of going?
32401,"Likely 6 women October 2021. I want a beach resort to relax on the beach, swim in the ocean, and have access to things like snorkeling and jet skis etc."
32402,My guess is that somewhere along the Riviera Maya would be your best bet. I was going to send you a sales pitch but we definitely don't cater to the jet ski crowd :)
32404,Keep in mind that‚Äôs peak hurricane season.
32405,"Yes, I‚Äôve considered this a lot. I‚Äôm also searching Hawaii and West Coast Mexico etc. thanks for looking out!"
32406,"We're on the west coast of Mexico and I think the danger of booking during hurricane season is overstated. Unless you're poor and are saving for a decade to make your trip happen, it's highly unlikely you'll be hit with a hurricane.

Coming to Mexico during the rainy season certainly means you might see some rain but the odds of having a hurricane land are pretty slim.

For anyone who can afford an international trip every year or two, it's not that big of a deal to go to Mexico during hurricane season."
32407,How does your socioeconomic status change the likeliness of a hurricane?
32408,"It doesn't. 

It changes how upset you'll be if it happens and fucks up your vacation. 

I'm just saying that if it's a once in a lifetime trip and you may never take another one like it then you should hold off and wait to go during the winter. 

But if you could afford a do over in 1-2 years then the risk is pretty low."
32409,Hilton Playa Del Carmen was a great time!
32410,"Agree with comments on avoiding Sandals....Not just for a girls trip, but any trip. 

We‚Äôve been around the Caribbean, and most of the all-inclusive deals have been underwhelming with the exception of Cocobay in Antigua, but it‚Äôs geared towards couples also.

Went to East Bay Resort on South Caicos last August and it was fabulous. Basically like being on a private island and beach. Accommodations are condo style and the price was really good. They have an all-inclusive option, but we ended up saving money not doing it.

The staff is great and the place is pretty new. Check it out on social media."
32411,It‚Äôs beautiful! Thanks for the recommendation (:
32412,"I work in travel and from the resorts and areas I have been to, I would say the Barcelo complex in the Mayan Riviera would be a good bet for you. There is so much to do there, it's massive. Close to any sort of excursion you would want to do as well. They just built there own excursion park that has zip-lining and all that jazz too. Its pretty amazing what they were able to build. The gym there is outstanding too, if that's something you look for."
32413,Thank you that all sounds fantastic! I will check it out
32414,I love Barcelo but really despise that there is a dolphin enclosure on site. :(

We stayed in the adults only section, which was close to the beach. It is a big resort, which some people don‚Äôt like, but it is very easy to get a golf cart to take you anywhere on the grounds. There are a lot of different restaurant and bar options. Right down the beach, off the resort  is the Jellyfish, with freakin amazing food."
32417,"We have had wonderful experiences in Cozumel, Aruba, and Puerto Rico. Would recommend any of them. For sheer relaxation on the beach and some water activities, I would jump at the chance to go to Aruba. Absolutely beautiful water, soft beaches, a constant light breeze, and a very relaxed atmosphere. Have fun wherever you go!"
32418,Yay thank you! I will look into these places especially Aruba (:
32419,"I'm a huge fan of Amanyara in Turks and Caicos. In general, the resorts in the Caribbean that do a lot of advertising and have 'deals', I avoid. They're geared for the average Canadian or American couple, looking for a warm escape on a honeymoon that tend to be easily impressed (often couples with limited travel experience who think being brought a cocktail on the beach is an impressive luxury rather than a basic expectation for a luxury hotel). The lesser-known resorts (Amanyara, Amanera, Jade Mountain, Cotton House, MO Canouan, Rosewood Mayakoba, Petit St. Vincent, etc.) are much more luxurious, and I can recommend them all. The *only* one I would steer away from for this trip is Jade Mountain, as it is more couples-focused.

The other option is AirBnB Luxe. You can get a large house on the beach, sometimes with a private chef, and you'll have more space than at a resort (but sacrificing soft product luxury)."
32420,Still in Fiji?
32421,"Yes, I'm just eating breakfast. Fortunately I didn't have to wake up at an ungodly hour today to deal with bullshit at work, but I have my first conference call of the day in a few minutes. Markets are up today so hopefully the meeting isn't all that stressful.

I think this is the least paradise-like a 'vacation' in paradise can be..."
32422,"All inclusive resorts are like germ buffets (I thought this before the coronavirus).  They are basically cruises on land and are essentially expensive forgettable moments in time.

For an unforgettable birthday celebration I highly recommend experiences your guests will enjoy and appreciate.   Think food and wine tour of Tuscany or Sonoma.  Rent a houseboat on Lake Cumberland or in Amsterdam.  There are many many many more unforgettable experiences that are a thousand times better than everything an all inclusive resort can offer."
32423,"It depends what you're looking for. I personally like more adventurous and unique experiences that cruises, but many people love them. A decent portion of people enjoy relaxing vacations like a resort."
32424,"Which is why resorts and cruises exist.  I just think people use them as a fall back so they don't have to plan anything.   Personally, if my friend asked me to spend money on an all inclusive resort, I'd politely decline.  They are too generic and boring for me."
32425,"I agree, I was just commenting that because OP seems like one of the people who likes them and specifically asked for recommendations about them."
32426,I suggested alternatives because I chose option C - ugly.   :)
32427,"I did an official wine tasting tour for the first time this summer in France and I definitely prefer to just buy wine at the store and drink it somewhere else. Most of the tour about the town and the processing was interesting but the actual tasting was probably the most pretentious thing I have ever done in my life. 

All the wine was delicious but none of it tasted like lasers, barbecued duck, aluminum, Snickers or whatever other notes they claimed were present."
32428,"I chuckled at your ""notes"" descriptions. 

I have done a few tastings in France.  I would say their sommeliers or tasting technicians or whatever they are called are more pretentious than elsewhere. The wine tasting pourers on the wine trail in Michigan are hands down the most fun and least pretentious I have experienced anywhere in the world."
32429,"If the protests are successful, the Michigan wine trail might be open soon, too!"
32430,A perfect way to get wine and Corona in one stop. . .
32431,"Unfortunately, I no longer live in the US, so I'll still need to wait for international travel restrictions to be lifted.

I think I could ""legally"" come and go as I'm a US citizen and a legal resident of Mexico but I'd prefer to just wait until the smart people have decided we're OK to roll."
32432,"Barcelo maya palace deluxe. Loved it every time I‚Äôve been. Lots of excursion options, good restaurants and drink options, plenty of space, and lots of pools. There‚Äôs even a nightclub on the property if you want I be out late but the crowd there is younger than I‚Äôd prefer. 

https://www.barcelo.com/en-us/barcelo-hotels/hotels/mexico/riviera-maya/barcelo-maya-palace/"
32433,"Thanks! I will check it out. Is it truly all inclusive? Am looking for alcohol, food, and stuff to do lol."
32434,"Depends on resorts and hotels but all inclusives in the Riviera Maya should have a bar, pools and restaurants at the very least."
32435,"Oh yeah. There are five resorts in the property and whichever one you choose gives you access to that one and all of the ones that are cheaper. The palace deluxe is the most expensive. We pay for the top shelf liquor package, then take $100 in cash. Most or all of the staff live in a dormitory in the property so you see a lot of them almost every day.  I give a $20 bill to a waitress every day and can barely drunk fast enough to keep up with the refills. But that is just to buy top shelf service. You don‚Äôt have to spend a penny at the resort if you don‚Äôt want to. 

I think the excursions are extra, FYI. But when I go, I don‚Äôt do anything but lay around or play golf. So I‚Äôm not certain about all of the excursions. 

We went to a sandals resort in St. Lucia for our honeymoon and it was underwhelming. We paid for butler service, which was nice, but not worth it. And the rest of the resort was just okay. Younger crowd in Mexico for sure."
32436,Thank you! This is exactly the type of info I‚Äôm looking for (:
32437,Yep. Happy to help. Hope you have a great birthday trip!
32439,"Thanks! I am trying to keep it around $5000 usd. I live in Seattle so I have easy access to an international airport. I literally want to lay on a beach with a drink in my hand one day, snorkel/jet ski/charter cruise etc. another day, have a pool with a swim up bar, decent rooms (looking like we will need 2 rooms which kinda sucks but I‚Äôm not finding much in budget that can sleep 6) and maybe some sort of night life club, casino, shows etc. if Vegas was on the beach, I‚Äôd be staying at Caesar‚Äôs, Bellagio, Wynn, or Palazzo if that helps with my taste preferences lol. My dates are in middle of October which I‚Äôm nervous about booking anything in the Caribbean during that time frame so I‚Äôm looking at west coast Mexico or Hawaii too. One cousin will be coming in from Japan, but the rest of my party will come from Texas so Hawaii or Mexico are easy locations for all of us to meet up."
32441,That‚Äôs just my portion. I‚Äôll PM you.
32442,"Depends on what you are looking for. If you are not going to leave the resort to sightsee/explore then it doesnt matter what country you go to, look for the resort that gives you the most of what you want. IF you are a foodie look for lots of restaurants, if you are a beach person get a great , long, seaweed free beach with enough loungers so you dont have to wake up at 5am to save them, if you like to party get a resort that has sister resorts closeby that all use the same disco so there is always nightlife.

Some of my favourites. Majestic Mirage/Elegance or Colonial in Punta Cana, Sandos Playacar in Playa Del Carmen, Barcelo Maya Colonial Riviera Maya, Hard Rock Riviera Maya."
32443,"Atlantis in the Bahamas is amazing. Great location , amazing hotel and grounds and awesome water park"
32444,"I have been to many kinds of all inclusives and otherwise. The best have a variety of activities, a variety of restaurants and available excursions. And are close enough to the action. This means the ""best"" as far as potential enjoyment. However, I have had just as much fun at 2 star places as 5 star. The difference is in how much you care about variety and ""level"" of food, the breadth of bar choices, and how active you expect to be. Also, the cheapest places tend to draw the kind of folks who may only care about unlimited booze and so you may deal with drunks and puke and drunken drama. And you have to put yourself in the equation too. If you expect to sit back and have happy times come to you and want perfection at every turn, there is not a single resort that won't disappoint you. If you show up, put your outgoing personna on and search out and join in to activities, talk to people - you will have fun. 

There are many very good resorts all over the Caribbean."
32445,"That‚Äôs why I asked people‚Äôs opinions I don‚Äôt want to hear a review of places I want to hear where people had good experiences. Ratings and reviews never meant anything to me I‚Äôd rather hear first hand experience. And I‚Äôm not high maintenance. I just want nice views, nice weather unlimited food and drinks maybe some activities not too much in just trying to relax. Thank you for your feedback!"
32446,"Reviews are good if you ignore the really negative as these people tend to be outrageously demanding and put no effort in. Like people complaining about arriving with a plane load and whining at the time it took to check in then immediately demanding 5 extra towels when they get in the room and waiting for them for 3 hours. Why would you do that? I am not surprised your grumpy demanding ass had a bad time.

Look for people praising the stuff you like and their interactions with entertainment crew. Some try harder than others. The ones that make an effort to involve people, we found, were better, regardless of the number of stars. 

If you are a beach person, look for photos of a wide beach. Some are narrow and small. Some have a steep incline in the water so not so much wading. If you like pools, some have various angles on these. A beach/pool restaurant and bar are nice so you don't have to dress to indulge. Also, if it matters to you, the distance from the airport or points of interest to you might matter. The Mayan Riviera is kinda great for this. There are ruins and eco-parks not so very far. You don't even need to purchase hotel excursions. We were able to jump on local transport for a couple dollars and pay into the sights. We went to Tulum on our own and at least one park, probably more. We have driven up and down that highway from Cancun to Belize many many times. The buses are modern. There are places like Jamaica where they don't even advise leaving the resort so keep that in mind if you are adventurous. If you want a less touristy place and can deal with paying for your meals etc. Bacalar at the other end of the Yucatan from Cancun is gorgeous. Lots of backpacker types. You can wander the town. Good meals are pretty cheap off the beach. We had a nice hotel including an amazing breakfast for $50/night just a nip back from the water. Highly recommend the boat tour around the lagoon. Pack a cooler."
32447,in egypt tui magic life kalauwi. its is beautiful. chocolate pizzas. kinder smoothies. pineapple juic. films(in german but if you are fluent like me its fine). snorkeling canoeing paddleboarding. camel riding. lovely rooms. workout areas. diving. pools. saunas. shows with people who hold fire. its the best all inclusive resort ever
32448,Kimpton on Grand Cayman is not one of those all inclusive places but worth a visit. I don't see the appeal of all inclusive anyway.
32449,Nice I‚Äôll deff look into that
32450,"Sandals Ochos Rios in Jamaica. It's the only all-inclusive I've ever been to, so I'm bias. We went there for our honeymoon, it was amazing. Weather was beautiful, food and drinks were great. The room was great. several day activities included, or you could go off the resort for a few excursions. Best massage I've ever had in my life, we talk about Jamaica at least once a month and it's been over a year now. Plus from our house the flight was super short.

Edit: It was the perfect spot for lounging in a pool drinking and eating, and activities if you choose. The resort always had evening things going on, but there was no pressure to go to them. It was also very private too. Almost every night we'd go swimming in hot tubing and there was no one else around. Also all sandals resorts are kid-free, so you don't have to worry about that either."
32451,I was there too..loved most of it..the beach sucked though..would go back for the rest
32452,"not sure why it's so hard for people to post where they've been and why they liked it.   
gO tO TrIpAdViSoR...geesh.  


with that being said, we enjoyed Secrets Wild Orchid in Jamaica. Good vibe (lower capacity thanks to COVID), some food was just okay and some was fantastic. nice mix of people. good dj's at the pool, never had to wait for a drink."
32453,Seriously I stopped going on Reddit because 90% of the groups I‚Äôm in or just bigots but thank you for your opinion
32454,haha gotcha. I'm literally looking for all inclusives as well. reading the comments on your post were annoying af. hope you found something worthwhile tho!
32455,So far I‚Äôm thinking Atlantis Bahamas it‚Äôs like super inclusive for two is only like $4000 and for real literally every post lately has been the same kind of answers
32456,The public beach because they even let you in without paying.
32457,That‚Äôs not all inclusive ü•¥ü•¥
32458,"Just look it up on Trip advisor

They have rankings for the top all inclusive resorts"
32459,I want to hear people‚Äôs opinions all of them have good ratings and reviews and I can‚Äôt decide lololol
32460,"You‚Äôre aware trip advisor is literally peoples opinions of them...

Fml"
32461,"And I literally said I looked and couldnt decide based off the reviews. And reviews are WAY DIFFERENT 

Smfh"
32462,"A review is someone‚Äôs opinion

Jesus you‚Äôre thick as shit"
32463,Nah you are a moron because I LITERALLY said I checked then already lolololol learn to READ
32464,You're mean everywhere
32465,"What did you check? 

You checked the trip advisor top all inclusive rankings and read every review did you? So much so you‚Äôd prefer a handful of Reddit opinions over thousands of verified reviews on TA?"
32466,Mexico sounds like it would satisfy most of your requirements. Cabo maybe?
32467,"We were looking into Mexico, and from what we've been seeing so far it seems to fit our needs the best (so far of course).  Any resorts in particular?"
32468,"Nightlife ending at 2AM... well Northern and central Europe are out of the question for you haha, thats when it really picks up!"
32469,"Haha, well that's why I made a note of it ending at 2am or after :P"
32470,"Ah I misread that as ending at 2am and missed the ""or after"" part."
32471,"Was speaking to a girl from Uruguay the other night, they don't even start drinking till 12am and don't even go out until 2!"
32472,"When I was in Denmark and Faroe we would pre drink at an apartment starting around 10 and take a bus downtown around 2-3 am, stay downtown until 7 or 8 and then go to a morning party where most people end up finding a couch or bed somewhere to sleep on most of the day, a bit crazy haha"
32473,"That sounds amazing hahaha! I've heard about those morning bars. 

What's the price of a pint when you're out like that?"
32474,"In Scandinavia and island countries up North it's very expensive, a bottle of decent beer (were talking like domestic, nothing fancy) would be around $8-10USD at the cheaper places. I didn't even bother going to the nice places. They often had ""uni specials"" where you would get 5 shots for 100kroner (about 3.5USD each), which was the cheapest way I found any sort of drink at a bar. Thats why so much pre-drinking, and drinking on way since they don't care if you drink on the streets and such."
32475,"For something a little different (and unforgetable), try Montreal and Quebec City. Quebec girls are the hottest in North America and Montreal nightlife is awesome."
32476,"yes, quebec girls really are gorgeous!"
32477,Where is your departure point? Does the $1300 budget include airfare?
32478,Departure point would be NYC and the budget does include airfare.
32479,I'm in the same situation looking for the same exact answer. Let me know where you choose and how it was
32480,"Well I chose Grand Oasis Cancun, in Cancun.  I didn't go yet but the reason why I chose that place over others were these reasons:

* It is attached to Oasis Cancun, which apparently is known as a ""young people"" resort due to the cheaper rooms.  It is basically an all-inclusive 3 star resort which attracts the young college/professionals crowd.  Yet the Grand Oasis is considered 3.5-4 stars so I get to sleep in the good spot and walk over to the party.
* Because it is the Grand Oasis Cancun I will have access to everything on Oasis Cancun and Grand Oasis Cancun.  According to reviews if you can pay the extra money (for me it was about $130+ more) then it is worth it since you avoid the long lines for food and drinks at Oasis Cancun since Grand Oasis has it's own private bars and restaurants.  Less lines = more drinks :P
* The only other resorts that came close to advertising a ""party atmosphere"" were Temptations and Hard Rock.  If you want to shell out the money then Hard Rock sounds great, but it's quite a bit more expensive (I would've had to pay $200+ and I would've lost 3 nights).  And Temptations sounds interesting for another time, but it seemed to have the reputation of being a ""swingers resort"" which me and my friends were not really interested in."
32481,Thanks man! I'll totally look into it.
32482,"I just got back from Moon Palace in Cancun. We went for my 26th birthday and it was amazing. The resort has EVERYTHING.. A nice club..great food and also amazing spa to relax. It had a nice arcade as well. If that wasnt enough, we went to the city for a club hopping package with got which was nice. We also went to Xplor park for zip lining. I highly recommend it for anyone in there 20s"
32483,"I like to read the one star reviews and tend to ignore the best ones as they all either love it and repeat themselves, or are complete shills.

The negative review (1 and 2 stars) tend to be a little more specific. Many of them are such minor inconveniences that even if they were by a corporate shills, it would be hard to believe that it might ever really deter anyone from staying there.

But on the other hand, if you repeatedly read one complaint that is crucial and stated again and again, it is worth taking note of, and possibly avoiding that location all together.

Also, this sucks to say, but honestly, the more money you spend, the better chance you're going to get exactly what you wanted. These expensive resorts and hotels don't stay in business if high paying clientele hate it and refuse to come back. They keep their high rating and prices high because there is a demand for that type or location and they deliver on a consistent basis. 

TL;DR: be rich"
32484,"I find reading 3 star, or the average reviews, most helpful. They aren't too extreme about either and give a balanced view of pros and cons."
32485,"This is how I've found my most accurate information on hotels, restaurants, and products I buy on Amazon. 3 star reviews are  pragmatic and often the most honest, because rather than being excited or hateful, the people are typically just normal"
32486,I agree with this one the most.
32487,"Exactly; pay attention to the negative reviews, that's what you notice more when you're there.

Also, take note of what the negative reviews are complaining about, and see if there's any patterns. If a place has 5 negative reviews, 1 complaining about the poor hot water system and 4 complaining about the cleanliness of the rooms, it's pretty safe to say that the hot water system was a one off issue, while the room cleaning is likely to be a reoccurring issue."
32488,"bingo, even if they are fake, if they all repeat one glaring issue, that could be a huge blessing in disguise."
32489,"There are fake negative reviews too. The shilling industry is not new. Repeated, fake, negative reviews also exist and are often used to sink new businesses before they can take customers from somewhere else. 

There is no magic solution for sorting out real and fake reviews, but looking for places with more reviews lessens the impact of shilling. So does comparing reviews from different places."
32490,"Basically, this. Look at the places with the best ratings on TripAdvisor, and then read all of the negative reviews. If one review has a specific complaint, it can be ignored. But if the same thing keeps coming up, then you might have an issue."
32491,"The best recommendations come from friends that have actually been somewhere good, and can tell you honestly that you'll have a great time.  

Tell us where you want to go and what your budget is, and perhaps your Reddit friends will help you out!"
32492,Looking at Cabo San Lucas now. Looks like the safest weather-wise.
32493,"I'm here in Cabo right now at the Riu Palace. wifi is good in the rooms and lobby. spotty elsewhere. it's located just outside of town. the beach looks nice but it's too strong of a current to go into. also the sand is coarse and hard to walk barefoot. 

the resort is all inclusive so all you can eat food and drinks. the buffet is good for buffet quality. first night we had hand carved Serrano ham and prime rib. The San Jose restaurant onsite had an amazing balcony for lunch or early dinner. I've been eating lots of ceviche and paella. my drawback is... I want authentic street tacos!

the resort seems pretty chill at night so to look for more of an uptempo scene you'll have to venture into town. PM your questions and I can try to answer you"
32494,"Wow, that resort is at the top of my list right now. That's a crazy coincidence."
32495,"The only thing I didn't like about the RIU palace was that I tipped every bartender and pool side server $10+ a round and I still got shitty service. I know it's all inclusive but I work in the service industry and always tip. I'm not sure what the problem was but it rubbed me the wrong way. 

The food was okay but the buffet gets old after 3 days. If you head into town there are a lot of good restaurants by the marina but expect to pay at least $15 a plate. Taqueria el paisa had the best tacos al pastor I've ever had in my life and they were super cheap. 

All in all the RIU palace is the way to go. Steer clear from the RIU Santa fe. The palace is much nicer and you'll enjoy having a nice room and a fully stocked fridge fill of beer and your own liquor cabinet."
32496,That's how it is at a lot of RIU resorts. Service is not the greatest but they will gladly accept tips and then disappear.
32497,"I have stayed at the RIU Ocho Rios in Jamaica twice, both times I tipped the bartenders at the bar closest to my suite when I arrived and the service was literally impeccable, they would pick my friends and I out of a crowd and serve us right away, I would be walking by and they would call me over just to shoot the shit if they weren't busy, no complaints."
32498,That's weird to hear. I was just talking about all inclusive Mexican resorts with guys who go there a lot. They told me if you tip a dollar each drink that's more then enough and will be treated great.
32499,"Yeah, we did the same in Jamaica ($1-2/drink) and always got great service."
32500,"That's how it's been for us every time. We always joke about how my Mr makes a bartender boyfriend at every area of the resort. They'll learn how you like your drinks and everything. This last trip was a double babymoon (my bff was due a couple weeks after me!) and the bartenders learned what the men liked to drink and would even offer it at our meals (""the usual, sirs?""). And they learned what flavors the ladies liked and would make up fun mocktails for us not to feel left out."
32501,That's awesome. I also love the idea of a babymoon
32502,"Did you tip in cash, or on a card? Do they *get* all their tip on a CC? I also have spent a while in wait service, and I know cash is always better, and I also have heard that some all inclusive places take a significant portion or all of a servers tip if it isn't in cash."
32503,"I stayed at the Riu Santa Fe and we had a fridge stocked with beer and soda and the liquor dispenser thing.  It wasn't at fancy as the palace true, but it was totally fine.  Plus we got good service.  And the deal we got couldn't be beat, 625 for airfare and 5 days 4 nights at the resort.  The only issue I had was a maid broke an expensive bottle of foundation and had to argue a bit that it wasn't already broken and that they should reimburse me, which they did"
32504,"I've stayed at both riu cancun, and riu palace las Americas. Liked them both very much. I found that a $20 tip in the morning got you whole group treated like kings at the pool bar. I did it every day. No matter how packed they were, I barely waited. Everything was very clean. Food is pretty bland, IMO. Breakfast was best. The specialty restaurants were good for a better service experience, but still bland. 

I'm a big RIU fan. 

I drank Miami Vices all day."
32505,What did you do? Did you just swing by after breakfast with a $20?
32506,I also would like to know how this works.
32507,There is nothing better on a Mexican beach than a Miami Vice.
32508,I have yet to find a beach anywhere that wasn't upgraded by a Miami Vice. A float of 151 really starts my day out right too.
32509,"If there's an Intercontinental in Cabo, I recommend it. I've stayed in the one in Puerto Rico and it was AMAZING! Wifi everywhere, the beach was wonderful, lots of little restaurants near by. Old San Juan was just a bus ride away and was absolutely beautiful! I've only heard good things from friends and family staying at Intercontinental Hotel/Resorts in many different countries. When I plan my honeymoon with my fiance, I'm going to try my hardest to stay at one again."
32510,"We stayed at the Rio Palace in Cancun, and it was super nice."
32511,"I know you said all inclusive, but...
There are tons of lovely German-run bed and breakfasts all over Mexico. They often operate by word of mouth and website/email, so expect to look a bit harder, but they're inexpensive, generally excellently maintained, full of interesting European guests, and very plugged in to the local scene. No food poisoning in the buffet (a buffet? Oh god how does that possibly work in a sub tropical climate with minimal knowledge of food service hygiene?) Good wifi and lots of hot water. I've always had much better experiences outside of the big hotels. As someone mentioned before, the staff do not give a fuck about individual guests, even if you tip well. Granted I've never been to Cabo, but in Huatulco and Veracruz this held true."
32512,"I love B&Bs, and that sounds amazing, but I'm pretty sure most of these places being discussed have more than a minimal knowledge of food service hygiene, I wouldn't worry THAT much about the buffet..."
32513,I've stayed there before too. We loved it!!
32514,Coincidence? Or fate. Dun dun dun.
32515,"Can Confirm. The swim up bar is dangerous to gingers (who spend 6 hours in it drinking...in the sun). Housekeeping was more than happy to replace every towel in the room, which was used to clean up the mess. A large tip was left.

Oh, and liquor dispensers in the room! 

The nightly shows are also a lot of fun. There was a vendor there that made these beautiful fingerpaintings on tile of the signature Cabo rock formation. I bought 2 of them, and they're hanging up in my office.

The Steakhouse there has one of the best pieces of cooked meat I've ever had."
32516,"I'm just thinking, is wifi *really* important on a honeymoon?"
32517,Sure if you don't know the area well and want to use google maps or to look up reviews on restaurants.
32519,"If a couple decides they will use the wifi to post what they are doing to facebook, that's their decision and not really my place to judge."
32520,"Wow, I wish more people on reddit were like you."
32521,http://xkcd.com/1314/
32522,"If you didn't update your Facebook status at least once on vacation, did you really go?"
32523,"Oop! You've got me there, completely slipped my mind!"
32524,"I was thinking the same thing. It's not just that they mentioned it, it's the fact that it was the first thing on the list of amenities.  How about the comfortable bed where you will be having great honeymoon sex, or jacuzzis in the room, or a nice shower...then 10 items down the list mention the wifi."
32525,"Riu Moon Palace in Cancun was very similar. My only beef with these big mega resorts is that they are very insulated from the area they are in. This could be exactly what you're looking for, but if you want to get the local flavor you need to make an effort to get off property."
32526,"Taqueria el paisa is where it's at. It's on the main road on the right hand side as you are heading towards cabo wabo. If you can, check it out!! Best street tacos I've ever had."
32527,"If you are from the US, be careful that when you drink too much alcohol you tend to ask for water. DO NOT drink those water with ice. Ask for bottled water. We made the mistake of drinking the local tab water with ice when we got drunk, and everyone who drank the local water end up either threw up or pee out of the asshole for a day or two."
32528,Happened to me while I was down there. Except it struck me while walking around the marina on a hot summer day with no bathroom in sight. Scariest 20 minute butt squeeze shuffle I've ever had. Almost shat myself.
32529,"Go to Los Claros. At the main square with all the bars in Cabo keep walking into ""real mexico"" past Harbard for like 5 blocks. Make sure to load up on toppings at the toppings bar. It's open until ~5pm. You'll be the only gringo there. Lunch will be ~$5.

If you are feeling less adventurous, the taco stand across from the Wyndham is okay also.

For late night chorizo (and only chorizo rest of menu is questionable) walk two blocks past Baja Junky away from the main strip to El tacazo.

Tamale truck in the main square at night is good, but probably a gamble."
32530,...what are you doing on Reddit while in Cabo?
32531,Probably his poop time. Lol
32532,No shit
32533,I want to go to RIU!
32534,Wifi is always my top concern when going to a beach resort
32535,Check out pueblo bonito sunset beach in cabo. It's on the other  side if the arch and away from the touristy area. It was very nice and romantic built into the side of a cliff with big rooms and great views. There is also another attached resort that is adults only and another that has 3 bedroom houses for rent for 300/night. We got it as a mystery hotel for 200/night all inclusive for 2
32536,"Lived in Cabo for 6 months. Not too sure about resorts, but have a bunch of people I could ask if you PM me, I like to wander/don't do the all inclusive thing. Weather wise, most of the year is fine, other than July-Early October is too hot for anything imo, and October-September is hot/rain/bugs. 

If you end up going:

-Make reservations at Salvatore's one night. (It's right downtown) Kick ass american chef retired there and runs it iirc. Super affordable and is probably the best food in cabo. 

-Take a day trip/water taxi to the semi secluded beach by the arch. Keep walking towards the arch after the tourist-y section (maybe a small amount of climbing depending on tide) Almost never anyone there, and it's incredible. Bring a camera...and a couple joints if you're into that type of thing and watch the tour boats go by. As long as you get back to the tourist spot before dark there is lots of water taxi's back.

-If you're both in to fishing/scuba diving etc, definitely do it. Make sure to haggle, w/e they quote you first is probably nonsense. 

-Pick a nice day, go bar hopping along the marina. Upgrade to decent tequila in your margaritas. :D

-Sunday brunch at mango deck is awesome. I desperately miss chilaquiles, and am tempted to fly back to Mex right now just thinking about them. Gets a bit wild if you stay past ~2 so keep that in mind."
32537,"If you are willing to splurge: One and Only Palmilla. 

Amazing! And we've traveled around the world, yet this had service quite like no other."
32538,"My parents have stayed at a lot of all inclusives and  lot rius. They said the Cabo San Lucas was actually there least favorite (of the rius) and their favorite was the riu Palace in cancun .  I haven't been to them though,  so I can't verify"
32539,"I like to look at hotels TripAdvisor sites as they usually have user photos. Not the elaborately staged bedroom photos. It's a good way to get your mind around the location from the every day eye.

Also talk to a rep with a holiday firm. Most have travelled more than the average Joe. And will have good recommendations. 
Local word of mouth is my favourite.  Best food and nights out I have had is following a locals advice. .. goodles luck"
32540,"I went with a friend a couple years ago to cabo and stayed at the villa del palmar, we thought we had booked all inclusive and when we got there discovered we hadn't. So we paid more than expected on the room and were worried. Day 1 we took the city bus to walmart which picked up right outside. Bought all of our margarita supplies and breakfast foods. It was super cheap! Then we ate out pretty much every lunch and dinner. Spent waayyyy less money than the price of all inclusive and didn't feel weird about going into town and eating. Definitely the way to go. We ate at the office which was fun, it's right on the beach, and at an Argentinian restaurant. Still had plenty of margaritas pool side that we ordered, but they also don't care if you make your own and bring them down to the pool, as long as you don't have glass containers. The villa was not filled with 21 year olds partying and I think the Riu usually is. Good luck!"
32541,This is very true. Our best experiences have been had in places recommended by friends and co-workers.
32542,"I know it's unlikely that you would happen to want to go to Bali, but if you did, [Desa Atas Awan](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608490-d3607758-Reviews-Village_Above_the_Clouds-Munduk_Bali.html) is where my wife and I honeymooned, and it was *amazing*. Genuinely good owners, beautiful location, and very much a 'getaway' resort."
32543,Wow. That looks amazing.
32544,"Bali is an amazing island. My SO and I went there 3 years ago now and had the time of our lives. We lived like royalty for 10 days, and we didn't step foot inside an all-inclusive resort.  
  
The street vendors and local restaurants are all great for eating. The food is safe to eat, and it's ridiculously cheap. For about $5 we both ate lunch and had drinks. For about $20 for dinner, we got two appetizers, two dinners, two alcoholic drinks, and two smoothies.  
  
When we went we spent a few days in Kuta and enjoyed the hustle and bustle, went to Uluwatu temple (I think it's known as the ""monkey temple""), went to lembogen island just off the coast, and got a nice relaxing day in a spa. Lembogen island was awesome because we went snorkeling but more because we toured the local village and learned about their seaweed farming and silk weaving. I bought a very large, 100% silk hand made sarong for $5. In America that same quality would be around $50 I assume.  
  
We also toured some villages on our way to Ubud. We visited a wood carving village, a jewel crafting village, where my SO picked up a pure silver ring with an emerald for $50, and we visited a plantation type place where they grow spices, coffee, and cocoa trees. I tried Kopi Lubak, which most people know as monkey poop coffee. The Lubak is more like a weasel to be honest, but I digress.  
  
Ubud was awesome as well. We didn't have any plans when we got there, it's a quieter area, not as touristy. We rented a scooter for $6 per day and tooled around the island on that.  
  
I would definitely recommend you take more time than we did, at least 2 weeks. You can't drink the water cause it's much like montezumas revenge, locally called ""Bali belly,"" but after you get used to it you're fine. The water is hard to avoid, because it's used to wash all of your food and brush your teeth, and obviously ice. I bet the resorts probably have filtered and treated water, but the. You never leave the resort.  
  
Have fun on your honeymoon!"
32545,"When we were in Bali, we spent most of our time in guesthouses that were about $20/day. However, we did two days here and it was very nice and still only $80.  Not really a resort feel, but Ubud is a fun small town to explore, if you are into that kind of thing vs. your more standard tourist fare (getting drunk at a pool bar, etc.)

32546,"Bali... We went there a couple of years ago. Had a fabulous time. We spent a lot of time with locals, and there were all to friendly/nice."
32547,"My wife and I have done a TON of all inclusives leaving from Toronto. For our honeymoon we chose to stay at the Excellence Playa Mujares  http://www.excellence-resorts.com/caribbean-and-mexico-destinations/excellence-playa-mujeres

Hands down, the best trip we've taken for the following reasons. 

1. There are 11 restaurant and you can eat at any of the just by walking up, no reservations. Italian, French, Indian, Tapas ect

2. They offer TOURS of their kitchen daily to show how they service all these restaurants and how clean it is. 

3. Swim up rooms and rooms with private pools

4. Alcohol is all top shelf stuff and a health juice bar

5. Soft serve ice cream machine about 1 min walk from our room hah

I could go on, if you want my tripadvisor ID you can read all my reviews, I can be fairly harsh on some resorts but this one really blew me away."
32549,"A swim up room? That is a thing? 
I haven't lived..."
32550,It's more of a lazy river that goes right past your room but yes you can swim to within a few feet of your patio from all over the resort
32551,Who comes up with this crap? That sounds awesome!
32552,"Have been there twice, and agree that it's definitely worth a good look if you're going all inclusive.  Loved the place, and it's a great location to rejuvenate and enjoy a great time in a beautiful location."
32553,"All I can tell you is that seven years ago tomorrow- ha, wow- my husband and I took our honeymoon vacation to Sandals Whitehouse resort in Jamaica. 

All-inclusive, couples only, great food, beach fun, everything you could hope for.

10/10 would honeymoon there again!"
32554,Did you see Michael and Jan?
32555,My brother in law got married in Jamaica and we had an excellent stay at the Sandals in Ocho Rios (http://www.sandals.com/main/plantation/rp-home/). We stayed at the inland property and it was adults only. VERY VERY nice!!
32556,"We also went to Whitehouse. Everything was great, my only complaint is that the free snorkeling isn't very exciting and there were too few of the free sailboats, I always felt bad taking one out for too long...

Best advice on the food - you're in the Caribbean, they know how to make good Caribbean food. The American or attempts at exotic cuisine fell short of my expectations. The lamb chops were possibly the best I'd had, the goat curry was amazing, the jerk shack was awesome.

It's not the sandals I'd go to if I were into nightlife like clubs, etc. They have entertainment every night, and it's good but a bit hokey, but not like a real club or anything. Some odd the other resorts are better at this if you care. We liked how quiet and uncrowded this one was, though. We had a good 50 yards of beach to ourselves most every day. At the sandals we visited in montego bay, there were people packed into the small beach, and they sell day passes to anyone who wants in, lots of ""shell"" vendors. (The shells are usually stuffed with a gram or so of weed, which is illegal in Jamaica)."
32557,"Also had my honeymoon at Sandals Whitehouse. Bars, pools, restaurants, staff, everything was a dream ! Singing at the Piano bar in the evening, campfire near the beach. 

You can hire a car to go to Treasure Beach or see this part of Jamaica, just try to avoid the potholes !"
32558,10/10 getting divorced to do this.
32559,I had a fantastic honeymoon at a Sandals as well. It was the best service and adults only. It was quiet at night though. Not too much entertainment. But we didn't mind as it was our honeymoon. We stayed at the Sandals La Toc in Saint Lucia.
