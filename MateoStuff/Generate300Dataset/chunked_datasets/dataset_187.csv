61298,"Finall Fantasy X is my favourite RPG on any console since it's my favourite game of all time.

But also Final Fantasy Type 0 - seriously, more people need to play this game. It has a cast of diverse characters an amazing soundtrack and a very different feel to any FF game - the closest would be VIII I think with the military schools.

I really enjoyed Tales of Berseria too. I thought the characters were all incredibly likeable and the combat was super fun. The main character is unfortunately supremely overpowered, rendering most fights a walk over if you play as her but it was still fun.

The story was extremely generic but the combat and characters easily make up for it. Magilou alone makes up for it.

If you're the kind of person that counts the SoulsBorne series as RPG's then all of those too. Personally I see them as action adventure games with RPG elements but a lot of people would say they're RPG's - especially since you can design and spec your character however you like."
61299,"I freaking LOVED Type 0. I wish the combat wouldn't be as clunky and shallow, but the rest is perfection in my opinion. It's the most extremely graphical Final Fantasy I've ever played, the story is tragic and mindblow, the characters are all diverse with different nice playstyles... and the music, holy jesus of RPGs."
61300,"YES! I was surprised by the epic scale of it given it was originally a handheld title.
I actually didn't finish my second playthrough, I need to pick up where I was, at some point. I just need to remember to make the different choices."
61301,"I know what u mean about the souls borne games and I'd agree to some extent but the only reason I had multiple playthroughs on them were the rpg elements, cosplaying as one of the bosses was very fun for me. Bloodborne being called fashionborn shows a lot too."
61302,"Oh I definitely agree on the replay value. I've never got into cosplaying the bosses but I love to come up with themed characters and limit them to only abilities and gear that would make sense for them.

Which in essence, is playing a role... I just can't list them as RPG's personally. I totally understand why people do though!"
61303,"Final Fantasy IX and X, Disgaea 1 and 5, and Dragon Quest XI."
61304,Dragon Age
61305,"Good response, thank you u/SquirtGirl69"
61306,Digimon Cyber Slueth. They are turn based with depth.  Lots of talking but a very addicting jrpg
61307,Whats a Digimon?
61308,"When you say RPG, are you talking more JRPG types? Resonance of Fate got a rerelease on PS4 and it's super underappreciated."
61309,"Ys VIII is a pretty solid rpg for me. The others like p5, FF, nier are a given."
61310,Odin sphere leifthrasir
61311,KINGDOM FUCKING COME DELIVERANCE MY DUDES
61312,Dude Skyrim for PSVR. This stuff is amazing in VR.
61313,"In no particular order...

* **Battle Chasers: Nightwar**
* **Persona 5**
* **South Park: TFBW**"
62500,Dragon Quest XI
61315,"Didn't see it mentioned:

**Grand Kingdom**

Solid turn-based RPG with interesting combat system and lots of customization down to setting up battlefield to your advantage with traps, barrels to block, flags to rally your troops or tunnel enemies and so on. Has semi-active online battles, too."
61316,"Secret of Mana remaster.   
One of the best Super Nintendo RPGs, second only to Chrono Trigger."
61317,Ni No Kuni 2 has been amazing
61318,"Dark souls 3. As my first souls game, I was pleasantly surprised how good the character progression mechanics were in terms of stats and items."
61319,"The Witcher 3, Skyrim VR, Fallout 4 (yes I actually like it), Nier Automata, Final Fantasy XV and Mass Effect Andromeda (again, I actually like it. Embrace the jank)"
61320,"Is Skyrim really one of the best RPGs? I am currently thinking about it, I loved Oblivion but I have also heard skyrim is kinda meh.."
61321,"Yeah it's definitely worth a look, I had it on Ps3 years ago and bought the remastered version for PS4 last week, added a few graphic mods and its great. It does feel somewhat dated in most areas but it's just the exploring and making your own story what makes it great. If you enjoyed Oblivion you should give it a go it's fairly cheap these days."
61322,"Probably you won't read this but... Oblivion was the the Elder Scrolls that I enjoyed the less. Probably because Cyrodill is the classic set up for high fantasy. It has good things like the Oblivion gates and such, but the faction quests ... can't talk good about them.   
Skyrim is definitely an improvement.   
But.... in regards of magic system and set up, Morrowind kicks their buts."
61323,Persona 5. It’s absolutely fantastic. The intro is a bit slow but after that you just wish that the game lasts forever. Best 110 hours I’ve ever spent in a game.
61324,FFXV and Shadow of War/Mordor.
61325,Shadow of War/Mordor are not rpgs
61326,Fallout 4 isn't the best but it's one of the few AAA RPGs this gen.
61327,"Dragon's Dogma

Nier: Automata

Final Fantasy XII

Persona 5

Horizon Zero Dawn


If you can pay for a sub, FFXIV may also be up your alley."
61328,FF XII I've actually been thinking about downloading all day since FF X was my all time favorite but i think that is partly due to nostalgia since I don't love a lot of the other FFs that I've played
61329,"FF XII is so good, oh boy, my fav FF alongside IX.  


Are there psx games on ps4? if so you could try Vagrant Story, that game is HARD and a little difficult to get into but it's awesome."
61330,"It’s not exactly open world, but everyone needs to play Nier Automata. Get on it OP."
61331,Agreed. One of the very best. Also i didn't see god of war on your list. Definitely check that one out if you haven't.
61332,Horizon zero dawn is genuinely one of the best and RPGs imo and is a unique setting. Would highly recommend.
61333,Divinity Original Sin 2 is a must play RPG
61334,"Maybe but I get the impression you could play that on a toaster, and I feel like the interface would be better w mac / PC than PS4"
61335,I disagree. My mouse broke when i was on my first playthough. I had no choice other than to use controller. And i never felt crippled playing it with a controller. It actually felt smoother
61336,"Really? I would think with all of the different abilities and accurate positioning, controller would feel gimped."
61337,Well it’s turn based so you aren’t gonna be needing to rapidly hit a bunch of mapped keys like an mmo or something. I never played it on controller just pc but I think the fact that it is turn based means it would work well even if a controller has less buttons than a keyboard.
61338,"I'm on my 3rd ps4 playthrough right now (and beat the first one twice) and I can say with certainty that it plays very well on controller.

The only thing that's a moderate pain in the ass is inventory management towards the end of the game"
61339,It works surprisingly well with a controller.
61340,"The game is actually really well made for controller and splitscreen play, I was surprised. I beat the game solo on PC but wanted to play with a buddy later on. We split screen co op and both used controllers. The dev's clearly took the time to make it smooth."
61341,Maybe check out the Yakuza series. There’s no character creation though
61342,Ill watch some videos on it right after I finish this ghost of tsushima video.
61343,Dogma's Dragon
61344,"Divinity Original Sin 2, it’s a turn based table top game which I usually don’t care for but this game is basically the pinnacle it’s phenomenal.

Multiple characters with their own story, your decisions have good or bad consequences.

The combat is phenomenal with the strategy elements
Ex: if there’s water on the ground and fire hits it, you get mist to blind your enemies or if you hit water with electricity any enemies standing in the water get zapped.

The story is phenomenal, it’s not one massive open world there’s about 3 big maps, they may look deceivingly small at first glance but they are massive with caves, dungeons, inter connecting areas.  It’s phenomenal"
61345,"I agree with this recommended, as a long time fan of the genre, it’s the best RPG game I’ve played in years. It scratched a big itch too, because there haven’t been any true RPGs released in a long time, we’ve been getting a lot of action RPGs instead and those just aren’t the same for me."
61346,Welp. It's time to replay BG2 again
61347,BG3 early access just released!
61348,I'll pass. I'd rather wait for the full release for the definitive experience
61349,"Normally I’m not into playing early access versions, but I think I might do this just so that I can get a good feel for the classes and combat in the first section of the game, before committing to a character for a full play through. 

In D:OS2, for example, I definitely made some sub-optimal choices for my character build before I had gotten the hang of everything, but I didn’t want to go back and redo Fort Joy when I still had the whole game ahead of me."
61350,">Divinity Original Sin 2, it’s a turn based table top game which I  usually don’t care for but this game is basically the pinnacle it’s  phenomenal.

I disagree with every fiber of my being. Larian is incapable of making a good game."
61351,"Please, elaborate. I like dos 1 and 2, but certaintly didnt love them as much as some, specifically the writing and story just failed to interest me most of the time, and there is a LOT of dialogue (too much needless fluff imo)."
61353,"Dude who would read that, it sounds like you guys don’t enjoy gaming at all.  Maybe you should focus on building a career making money in something your interested into than bashing a masterpiece game because you don’t like it."
61354,">Maybe you should focus on building a career making money in something your interested into

Already did that. Gaming is one of my hobbies. If you read the review, you would understand that it isn't simply bashing the game because the reviewer ""doesn't like it"". The reviewer brings up some great and valid criticisms regarding several of the core mechanics of the game."
61355,"I actually dont agree with the vast majority of that review funny enough. I liked dos 1 ee a lot, dos2 not as much but that may have been because i played it only a few months after dos1. Theyre good games but in the second, I was relying on cheese tactics wayyyyy too often just to pull through a fight, and would probably enjoy it a lot more on the lower difficulty options where you dont have to do 15 hours of sidequests for every hour of mainquests just to be properly levelled/geared. Optional side content should be just that, optional, and i hate when games force you into them by level gating the main quests."
61356,Dragon Age Inquisition? It’s very detailed and the process while leveling up is tedious but enjoyable at the same time.
61357,"Came here to say this. The characters are well written and storyline is rich, but it isn’t overwhelming if you haven’t played the prior two games."
61358,"Final Fantasy IX is arguably the best one, you can't miss it 

DARK SOULS 1 and 3 --- just do it. It's difficulty is overhyped, its tough but fair and you DO adapt. There is a reason these games are so highly regarded, there is nothing quite like it

Dragon Age is absolutely brilliant, one of the best games you can play 

To that end, so is Mass Effect trilogy ( play all three, don't skip any) 

Horizon Zero Dawn is impressive more than you'd expect"
61359,"Why is there barely any love for dark souls 2? I get why,but if you take a step back and think about it,its a really good game"
61360,"Its a good game in it's own right, but it is (in my opinion) significantly overshadowed by the other two which are much, much stronger."
61361,Dragons dogma!
61362,"Some of old remastered

Rogue galaxy

Star ocean series

Dragon quest xi

Kingdoms of amalur

Dark souls series

Bloodborne

Theres more but those would eat up months"
61363,Persona 5 Royal. Easily one of the best games overall on the PS4. great if you enjoy JRPGs.
61364,"I do love som JRPG, but I find the ""high school"" theme offputting. Is that game good for adults too?"
61365,Absolutely. I'd rank it in my top 3 RPGs of all time
61366,"Shin Megami Tensei is basically Persona without the Highschool theme (if I remember correctly, Persona is technically a spinoff of SMT but overshadows the mainline games by now). 

SMT3 (Nocturne) is getting a HD remaster and SMT5 is supposed to be released sometime in 2021. Both are exclusive to the Switch though, much like SMT4 and Strange Journey were exclusive to the DS.

Still, Persona games are really great, even if you don't like the High school stuff. It's not quite as trope-ish as other takes on it and P5 especially puts less focus on the school setting than P3 or P4."
61367,"Only SMT V is Switch exclusive.

Nocturne HD will also be on PS4."
61368,"Thanks for the correction, I wasn't aware of that!"
61369,"I would go as far as saying Persona 5 is more adult/mature than most games, despite the main characters being in high school. It deals with some dark, heavy themes such as mental and physical abuse, abuse of power, family problems, suicide, free will vs. determinism, and rebellion. It's not a game for kids, to be sure. A late teenager would probably be in a good place to get into the story (I kind of wish this game was out when I was a teenager, actually) but it's relatable to adults as well. I mean, we all went to school once. It gives the story a sense of familiarity. The characters are in that age of life change and finding themselves and their place in the world, which is the perfect perspective to view the game's themes."
61370,Was put off by the high school setting of the series for years as well.  Now I consider it one of my all time favorite franchises of any genre.
61371,Amazing game. Best of the generation in my opinion.
61372,Kingdom Come Deliverance
61373,If you liked Skyrim and Witcher 3 then you’ll probs like kingdom come as it’s similar setting flow complexity etc minus the fantasy it’s so good I’m loving it
61374,"Kingdoms of Amalur was rereleased for ps4, its the same thing as was before, but if you havent played it then and dont mind older graphics and quest design, go for it, its old school rpg, with its own charm."
61375,Assassins Creed Odyssey. Gorgeous open world game. Lots of fun.
61376,Copy paste missions with a progression you can pay to skip. Ubisoft shlock.
61377,"Just grabbed Ghost of Tsushima on sale and imo it’s worth the hype. Open world feels good, quests are engaging, and though there’s no character creation the characters and protagonist are compelling and well written. As a disclaimer though I’m only bout 5-10 hours in."
61378,"Ghost of Tsushima is really good, but there’s no character creation. 
- Dragon Age
- Greedfall 
- Code Vein
- Dragons Dogma"
61379,"Played Dark Souls or Bloodborne? Not open world, but they have great level design and damn rewarding gameplay once you get the hang of things."
61380,I have played Dark Souls 3 and my brother is playing Bloodborne right now and is sending me the disk after he finishes but thank you!
61381,Maybe try Nioh? Its a great masive game.
61382,"Vampyre is free this month on ps+ don't know how good it is not played it yet. I think most of the older final fantasy games are on the store if you want nostalgia, possibly dragon quest 11 I loved every minute of that game.
Seen it mentioned already but divinity original sin 2 is deffo worth checking out.
Kingdom hearts, Kingdom of amular remake is out.
I personally feel detroit become human is a fantastic game, no combat but hell of a story and choices matter."
61383,"Vampyr is an amazing game, but its not a big world and its a lot of ""detective"" work.

Definetely worth buying."
61384,"Dragon Age

Dragon Quest

 Kingdoms of Amalur 

the Tales of series

Persona 5 (my favorite game on the platform)

Horizon Zero Dawn

Less pure RPG with small hubs rather than large open worlds, but God of War and the current Tomb Raider trilogy"
61385,"You owe it to yourself to give Divinity Original Sin 2 a try. It doesn’t fit into what you’ve played before, but it has all of the elements you are looking for."
61386,Yakuza
61387,Not got character creation but since you seem to have the same tastes as I do I highly recommend Ys VIII. I didn't really know much about it when I picked it up but I thought it was an amazing game.
61388,"One thing that really surpirsed me about ys viii lod was how much I actually cared about the story and characters. A lot of jrpg fans talk about how well crafted the stories are and how great the characters are but 9 times outta 10 I end up finding jrpg stories naive at best and rarely surprise me or ever feel remotely close to having believable characters that feel ""real"". Everyone talked about how great the combat feels in ys, and they werent wrong, but the story wraps up on an amazingly bold and surprising way that was so refreshing (assuming you get the true ending)."
61389,"Pathfinder: Kingmaker

Divinity Original Sin 2

Mass Effect 1 - 3"
61391,I'm on tales of vesperia right now.
61392,"Divinity Original Sin 2 has the best roleplaying in a video game and a fantastic story. Pillars of Eternity is also worth trying out; not as good as Divinity, but still great"
61393,"Are you okay with JRPGs? If so, Trails of Cold Steel 1, 2, and 3 might be up your alley as they are semi open world."
61394,HORIZON ZERO DAWN!
61395,All the Fallouts means Fallout 3 through Fallout 4 I'm guessing
61396,"FF XIV
Persona 5
Dragon Quest 11
(Last two don't have character customization but are fantastic games)
Ghost of tsushima is also amazing if your into it
FF7 remake"
61397,BLOODBORNE?
61398,"I’d recommend Dragon Quest XI. If you like Final Fantasy, you’ll LOVE Dragon Quest."
61399,"Dragon's dogma , dark souls remaster , bloodborne,  final fantasy XV , kingdom of amalur reckoning remaster"
61400,"Dragon dogma,  final fantasy xv,  bloodborne,  dark souls remaster , kingdoms of amalur reckoning remaster,  ghost of tsushima,  ac odyssey / origins"
61401,Persona 5 (Royal) and Nier Automata are my two favourite games on the PS4
61402,"Conan exiles
Dark souls 1 and 2 ( not open world but very non linear and alot or replayability )
Citadel
Dragon age inquisition
Elder scrolls online 

Tera mmo but free
Black desert mmo but free
Neverwinter mmo but free"
61403,Trails of cold steel
61404,"Fishing for the new cult followers, are we? The Trails series is emphatically NOT what the OP is after."
61405,"Fishing for upvotes? 😁Let OP decide what they want to play. I just made a simple suggestion, fuk boi"
61406,Killer bean
62409,"Full on RPGs:

- Divinity Original Sin 1/2 (great DnD style RPG)

- The Witcher 3

- Dragon's Dogma (The game feels a little outdated to me but you might like it)

Action RPGs:

- Borderlands 3

- Dark Souls 1/2/3

- Nioh (Soulslike game in feudal Japan)

- Bloodborne

- The Surge (pretty good soulslike game with mech exosuits)

- Shadow Warrior 2 (Borderlands meets Doom)

Games with some RPG elements:

- Nier Automata

- God of War

- Monster Hunter World


If I had to choose 1 of each category I'd say Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3 and God of War are pretty safe bets but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of these"
62410,"Genuinely curious as to why you have listed Nioh as an Action RPG, whereas Nier as a ""game with RPG elements""?

Aside from visual appearance of armor, I can't see any world where Nioh has more RPG traits than Nier... again, just curious as to your thought process, not trying to start a feud. 

Having that all been said, I'd absolutely list Horizon Zero Dawn under your games with RPG elements category!

EDIT: Ask an honest quest, get downvoted. k."
62411,"I don't think you should be downvoted, the RPG genre is very broad and what defines an RPG varies from person to person. 

To me, Nioh classifies more as an RPG because borrows from other ARPGs, It has a soulslike combat and is a loot-based game but going beyond that the game has ways to customize your character, from distributing your stats to different gear types, from battle skills to guardian spirits. Beyond that its endgame is all about min-maxing your gear, doing runs to get better quality gear or materials to forge and reroll stats on your armor, weapons and even change their appearance. You can build a character that suits your playstyle which is I think what an RPG is all about.

On the other hand, Nier has ways to customize your character but they get pushed to the background in favor of other aspects of the game. Sure you can put chips on you and complete quests but you're still playing as 2B and your playstyle is still being dictated by the moveset of a couple of weapon types. At the end of the day, I think Nier is more a story-driven hack and slash game first and an RPG second"
62412,"Completely solid train of thought, thank you for explaining. 

I agree, it definitely depends on the definition of ""RPG"" that you go with. For me, the exploration and multitude of sidequests, while still allowing for intensive character customization (I think the chip-setting allows for far greater customization than most RPGs, just not aesthetically), plus having a huge selection of weapon options, feels very RPG to me, which I why I initially questioned. You make completely fair points though."
62413,I believe Witcher 3 is $15 at the moment which will most likely be the most common answer you'll get as well
62414,Witcher 3 is still the one for me. I just started Horizon Zero Dawn and as much as I like it I wish the world had more to discover for myself like the Witcher does.
62415,"Horizon is hardly an RPG, though."
62416,I feel like it is a perfect example for a modern action RPG. Not saying it is what an RPG should be like but I think it is the general direction the industry is moving to
62417,I would say Soulsborne is a better example of a modern action RPG. The rpg elements in games like Horizon and AC Odyssey are pretty basic and barebones. While in games like Dark Souls the RPG mechanics are far more prominent and core to the gameplay. Soulsborne is far more reliant on stat building and management.
62418,I agree that they use overly simplified basic RPG mechanics. I feel like this is just to make sure that the games stay as accecable and maintstreamy as possible. Dark Souls or in general From games are an entirely different beast to conquer.
62419,">  I feel like this is just to make sure that the games stay as accecable and maintstreamy as possible

Which is funny since games like Assassin's Creed were already pretty fucking mainstream, lol."
62420,"I almost felt the opposite.  I loved the Witcher 3, but I think I enjoyed the World created by Horizon more.  The seemless transition from one half of the game to the other in Horizon felt really good.  In the Witcher 3, everything seemed open at first, but then you realize how it is all cut up into zones.  Then you see how much of the world that is there is just window dressings (buildings you can't enter, NPCs you can't talk to, etc.)  I felt more engaged in the smaller world of Horizon than the larger one of the Witcher."
62422,"It's fantastic indeed! And with each companion having a rich, long story (that may conflict with other companions's stories), you definitely want to play it more than once!"
62423,Is it any more 'guided' than number one? I tried number one and enjoyed the world and combat but found the quests difficult to understand what I was meant to doing and where to go early on.
62424,"I'd say so - I stopped playing in the middle of 1, but with 2 I started a second playthrough right after finishing the 1st one. Never felt lost story-wise either."
62425,"The amount of random things that can happen do in D:OS 2 is nuts. Pretty early in the game I killed a character which I found out much later actually plays an important part. So I reloaded a save from before I killed that character expecting it to go roughly the same, but literally everything went completely different the second time, dialogs were different, it was great."
62426,I just wish you could move faster than a slug in this game.
62427,I actually got this game on PS4 and then again on PC just so that I could download the faster movement mod. 100% would do it again.
62428,I am currently playing this right now and I love it. I am about 40 hours in and havent gotten on the boat yet...Its so good and really deep in its RPG mechanics
62429,Dragons Dogma.
62430,The One True God!
62431,I don’t get why it isn’t mentioned more often. It’s a great game
62432,"The empty world, the busted story, the bizarre mythology, the travel options - don’t get me wrong, I love the game - but there are plenty of reasons to dislike it."
62433,And some very weird difficulty spikes.
62434,"It's extremely underrated.  The story, the gameplay, the rpg elements, this game deserves way more attention."
62435,Look Arisen! Wolves!
62436,They ill like fire!
62437,Dtagon quest xi. I've sunk about 75 hours so far into it.
62438,"Persona 5 for sure. The length of the game alone is worth it, it took me 70 hours to complete and i went through the game pretty fast. Great story, great characters, killer soundtrack and easily one of the most polished games of this generation."
62439,I just wish there was more music.  I’m probably around 80 hours in and going crazy with how much certain songs get repeated.
62440,"I didn't partake in anywhere near the full amount you can do and I finished it in 169 hours. Very stylish game, and it's great to play something so character focused and have those characters be so good."
62442,"Youre probably around 3/4ths of the way through. Granted, its maybe another 30ish hours before you might complete the game"
62443,70h? You mustve really rushed it. Im like halfway through the game and im at 75h. Im taking the time to max out all my confidants and level up
62444,Do you have to play the other ones to know what’s going on?
62446,"Witcher 3 if you haven't played that yet

Fallout 4 was decent in my opinion

Diablo 3

Final Fantasy XV"
62447,"I have played The Witcher 3 actually, got about 30% in and got really really stuck. But could pick it up where I left off.

I have Fallout 4 also. :)

Not tried Diablo games.

Can you just jump on the band wagon so far into FF? Haha"
62448,"You should give Witcher 3 another shot, great game

Diablo 3 is a must play dude. Get it. NOW!

Each final fantasy game is its own story. They are not connected at all. So yes you can just buy FF15 and play it. Highly recommended."
62449,"I’ve just looked at Diablo 3, and I’m not too keen on them types of RPG, prefer the Witcher style. 

Would you say FF15 is closer to the Witcher style, or Diablo style? 

Also, people say ‘pre FF13’ - why? Is there a change"
62450,"The FF games from PS1-2 (FF7, 8, 9, 10, 12) were all turn-based. 11 and 14 are MMO's. 

15 has more of an active, action-rpg style combat, which some old-school FF fans didn't enjoy as much. I thought it was really good though. Take a look at both - you may enjoy the old-school style ones though; PS4 has a bunch of them remastered."
62451,"FF15 is more like The Witcher than Diablo 3

Just look at some gameplay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGdPVsTliT8"
62452,"Yes Witcher 3 is the best RPG right now (for me), i got stuck at my first playtrough at 30 % too. But you have to continue the game, unfortunately its a bit boring at some parts around 30% but it will get better"
62453,"Each FF is it's own thing.  FFXV is okay.  There are parts I really liked (surprisingly the characters and setting).  There are parts I didn't like (the last half of the game was very rushed feeling, and a lot of the story is behind DLC paywalls).  Some of the previous FF games are on PS4 and I would recommend them over XV (FFVII, FFIX, FFX, and eventually FFVIII).  FFVI is also one of the best in the series, but isn't on PS4 as far as I know."
62454,"If you got stuck playing the Witcher games, just ignore all the question marks on the map. Most of them are pointless, repetitive slogs.

You can play the game through doing only the main storyline quests with absolutely no issue. Personally I would also do the monster bounties because they are fun and provide some varied gameplay.

I'd also suggest choosing one of the Witcher armor sets ([bear, cat, griffin, and wolf](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_3_witcher_gear)) and doing the quests to get and upgrade that."
62455,Nice one thanks.. think I’m going to pick it up again on way home.. second hand hopefully
62456,"Diablo 3 is shit. It's not an rpg, it's a hack and slash. If you want character, story, immersion then Witcher, Skyrim, fallout etc do a great job. D3 is just wave after wave of bad guys with weak plot points to send you somewhere else. 

The first Diablo was great, it's been downhill since for the franchise."
62457,The first game was good.  The 2nd was great.  The 3rd was just okay.  I really hated what they did to the skill trees.  I also felt like the story/environments just weren't as good as the first two.
62458,"Diablo 3 is the result of blizzard having MMO-mania and forgetting what made 1 & 2 so good. They failed, had to basically relaunch the game, and figured out how to make it fun."
62459,It bills itself as an action rpg but they forgot about the rp bit.
62460,It is not shit and it is a type of rpg. The genre is pretty diverse actually. A game does not have to be like W3 or Skyrim to be an rpg.
62461,"I just dl’ed Persona 5; I admit I haven’t played it yet, but given the amount of extremely good reviews, the fact it has a ton of gameplay hours involved, and it’s around $15 for a couple more days, I couldn’t pass it up."
62463,"Even more stoked to play it.  I bought it and haven’t been able to start it yet, and I’m out of town for a few days - so it’ll be waiting for me when I get back!"
62464,I just bought. It is absolutely amazing. Im 75h in and still loving it
62465,played it for around 150 hours and still enjoy it lol. have fun bro
62466,"I got it on sale last year, and was about 80% sure I would hate it and quit playing. Turn based combat has never really been my thing and I generally don't go for japanese-style games. I was wrong. I don't even know why I loved that game, but I'm so glad i gave it a shot."
62467,"It is a really great game.  It takes a bit to really grab some players, so don't give up on it too early.  I was hooked in the first hour, but others say it takes a while."
62468,This is the best JRPG answer hands down
62469,"No particular order but these are the best ones imo

* Divinity Original sin 1/2 

* Persona 5

* God of war

* Horizon zero dawn

* The Witcher 3 

* Any Final fantasy game 

* Nier automata 

* Skyrim/fallout 

* Assassins creed Origins/Odyssey"
62470,If you're recommending action RPGs I feel like ~~yee-haw simulator 2018~~ Red Dead 2 deserves a mention as well
62471,"God of war...an RPG? It's a great game for sure, but not an RPG"
62472,"It certainly leans more action than RPG, but it does have a ton of equipment/skills to craft/collect/upgrade."
62473,"That doesn't make it an RPG. Just ""RPG elements"" which sadly is all that's required these days :( RPGs need branching paths, dialogue trees, persuasion, multiple ways to solve problems. God of War and Horizon aren't RPGs at all imo."
62474,"Neither is AC: Odyssey, but that was the game OP was referencing so that is why so many recommendations are lax on the ""RPG"" requirement."
62475,"I would argue that AC Odyssey is more of an RPG than AC Origins though. Odyssey has different dialog options, lots of upgradable loot, skill trees, optional side quests and you can totally finish missions in different ways. I agree it's all very light, but in that way it's not that different from the Witcher which Ubisoft clearly tries to mimic with the new AC games."
62476,">  RPGs need branching paths, dialogue trees, persuasion, multiple ways to solve problems

I'll have to disagree with that. What about the RPGs that don't have these things? Like all the Final Fantasy games, Dragon Quest, Soulsborne, etc...? What do you consider those games?"
62477,"Action adventure with RPG elements.

The main thing you do in From Software games is explore and fight. They have a lot of RPG elements but I don't consider them full on RPG."
62478,"I'd say more like action-RPG. The RPG elements are rather important and core to the gameplay. It's like the main factor. It is heavy stat-oriented and you can customize your character in many ways. 

I'd consider games like Horizon Zero Dawn and AC Odyssey Action-Adventures with RPG mechanics since they have some RPG mechanics but it's pretty barebones. While Dark Souls's RPG mechanic is much more heavy and prominent.

What are games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest?"
62479,I agree. Monster Hunter World won best RPG last though so I don’t think RPG really means anything anymore to most people.
62480,"Progression has a lot of RPG in it where you get to build your skills and loadouts, including emphasizing different things like speed or strength or boy. 

The story is not choice-driven though, though there are side quests and things that are optional. 

That being said, it's a fantastic game that everyone should play."
62481,GoW is an rpg as much as witcher 3 is lol
62482,God of War isn't an RPG. Horizon barely is either.
62483,The Witcher 3. Imo the best story. The world is also gorgeous. The controls might feel a little wonky for some but I didn't think they were bad at all.
62484,"I got to say I bought the Witcher 3 as soon as I got my ps4 and I was lost AF.  My first console since 2005ish.  I got bored a few weeks ago and went looking through my library instead of spending more money found Witcher and fired it up.  I've been having a blast ever since and I'm 50 hours in.

Might want to give it a nod."
62485,"If you like ac Odyssey and the Witcher you'll like horizon zero dawn.

It's an amazingly beautiful game, and well thought out.

Also where are you stuck in the Witcher?"
62486,I liked AC Odyssey and The Witcher 3 but thought Horizon was a bit shit.
62488,"Lots of running across a world that felt dead and I didn't enjoy the combat.

The robots were cool to look at though and the story was ok despite the robotic camerawork/animations during the cutscenes with dialogue options, shame that the dialogue options were completely pointless too."
62489,It was a while back now but vaguely remember some witches and a cave possibly. I’ll buy it second hand and it should pick up where I left off
62490,"You definitely should! If you're stuck there try doing some other stuff first around the area, collect the right potions to put on your sword! That really does the trick most of the times!"
62491,"I think I snookered myself, ended up in a place where I needed some oil for my sword, didn’t have it, or the money to get it. Have you ever found yourself in a position like that on it?"
62492,"Yes! It's very annoying, I think I just ran for it, and came back at a later time. It was the werewolf quest for me"
62493,"RPG is a broad definition these days, is it third person open world games that you're looking for or any type of RPG?

I'd recommend all the Final Fantasy games pre-13 that you can buy on PS4. (FF8 coming soon)"
62494,"Well I’ve just looked at Diablo 3 on YouTube, I don’t like them types of RPG, prefer the Witcher type"
62495,"What left-ball-sack said. Skyrim, I don't know. I liked it when it was relatively new and I hadn't played many other games, but it's not that amazing. RPG is a broad spectrum of games, though. If you ejoy the process of looting and leveling, give Dark Souls a go. I thought I wouldn't like it, and I think most dark souls players thought the same thing, but it's a masterpiece. If not that, then Horizon Zero Dawn for sure."
62496,Which dark souls? Or any of them?
62497,"That's a bit tough. DS 2 gets a bad rap by hardcore fans, but it's still a worthy entry if you fall in love with the other two. DS3 is really great, and the most polished. DS1 is a masterpiece in it's own right with plenty of brilliant ambition, but you can tell it's a bit older and made by a team still figuring some things out a bit. I go back and forth between recommending 3 first and recommending 1 first. If you enjoy it, Bloodborne is also fantastic (some say the single greatest PS4 game in existence), and there's a whole subgenre that's grown out of Dark souls (the souls-like genre) that also would include nioh and a few other titles. I liked the surge, lords of the fallen is a total souls clone, but somehow fails completely. Surge 2 is coming out in september along with code vein, which is also souls-like. I personally consider sekiro to be souls-like, although it's definitely a brand new path for From Software as well."
62498,If you've not played it then Skyrim or Dark Souls
62499,Witcher 3 and Divinity Original Sin (1&2). Persona 5 if you are into Japanese RPGs
62501,Kingdom Hearts I haven’t seen mentioned
62502,"It gets a lot of flak, but I really like Dragon Age Inquisition."
62503,Ys Lacrimosa of Dana
62504,Persona 5.
62505,Final Fantasy 10 remaster
62506,Shadows: Awakening. It was a fun rpg. The gameplay mechanics were pretty unique.
62507,For the King is a fun little (co-op) RPG that is suprisingly deep.
62508,"First, I wouldn't call Assassin's Creed an RPG, unless you really twist the genre.

That said, here are the titles I recommend:

* MMO:
   * Final Fantasy XIV
* Offline, GCD-based:
   * Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age
   * The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Complete Edition
* Offline, turn-based:
   * Child of Light
   * Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age
   * Final Fantasy X
   * I Am Setsuna
   * The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel I & II (don't play or even buy II until after you've finished I)
   * Persona 5"
62509,"AC Odyssey is a joke. For RPG, try

* Skyrim SE
* Witcher 3
* Persona 5
* Fallout 4
* Divinity Original Sin 2
* Kingdom Come Deliverance
* Greedfall (out in Sept)
* Outer Worlds (out in Oct)"
62510,You’re definitely the first person to say anything bad about Odyssey
62511,"Now this is just my opinion. I was fairly excited to play it when I got it about 2 months ago. Played all the ACs up until unity, and none after. I heard they were like RPGs now and what not. 

Turns out Odyssey was just an unnecessarily large world with some of the worst copy/paste content I've ever seen. Great graphics and combat, but that's about it. Missions are just as bad, story is just as bad, now there's a tiered loot system, mtxs, on and on. 

Again, the world looks beautiful and the combat is nice. But good lord is that game way too repetitive. I'm about 60 hours in and I've given up."
62512,No he's not. It's watered down typical Ubisoft shit where all the quests are the exact same.
62513,"I would say Odyssey is a pretty good game, but I wouldn't classify it as a full on RPG. It's more of an action game, with some light RPG elements (dialogue choices that don't change much, some gear/weapons to swap, skill tree, etc.)

People have all kinds of different definitions of what an RPG is; I think the previous guy was saying he didn't consider it an RPG. Good game, just not a traditional RPG like some others."
62514,How dare you leave out Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3.
62515,"As others have said, Witcher 3 is a great game at a good price right now with the DLC"
62538,Witcher 3
62517,"- The Witcher 3 (Full fledged, huge open world, high fantasy RPG)
- Nier Automata (Action-JRPG, with some of the most unique characters and writing you could hope for. Also, amazing music) 
- Horizon Zero Dawn (Great world and combat, light on the RPG elements) 
- Dragon Quest XI (Tradition style JRPG that feels like it was plucked out of an NES and rebuilt to be beautiful on the PS4)
- Final Fantasy XV (Action-JRPG with a cool road trip vibe that's unique in gaming. Not the best story of the franchise but absolutely worth a playthrough)
- Persona 5 (A fairly unique highschool Sim/Dungeon exploring JRPG that oozes style and plays a bit like a mature Pokémon)
- Dragons Dogma (Some of the best combat in the history of gaming, high fantasy and fun. A bit dated, but a lot to love)
- Bloodborne (It might not scratch your RPG-itch if you're looking for a big extravagant world, but this was my biggest surprise. I expected to despise this game and fell absolutely in love it, so I have to recommend it)"
62518,Divinity original sin 2 !!!!
62519,Bard's Tale IV is coming soon?
62520,Yeah i might have underestimated the amount of hours i sunk into the game seeing as i played it so long ago. Still just an incredible game with some of the most incredible characters
62521,bloodborne
62522,"Divinity 2 is a killer RPG.   


You also have greats like The Witcher, Persona 5, the Tales Of games, and Dragon Quest."
62523,"If you’re into first person games with RPG elements, try Dying Light with the Following. A lot of game, a lot of player customization, and probably the best zombie game that I have played (I was too sick of Uncharted to get into the Last of Us). The only caution is a weak story."
62524,"The Yakuza series. Yeah, its a brawler/beat-em-up, but its also chock full of RPG mechanics like random encounters, leveling skills, equipment, and shit tons of dialogue and various activities. Easily can get 50-100 hours out of each title."
62525,"Persona 5

Dark Souls 3

Bloodborne"
62526,The Witcher 3 and bloodborne. Persona 5 is also amazing but very story focused.
62527,The Witcher 3: Game of the Year Edition is £10.49 on offer on PlayStation store
62528,The Witcher 3.
62529,if you're not familiar with Ni no Kuni then its a must have
62530,Monster Hunter World
62531,"Been playing Skyrim vr, if you don’t own psvr I recommend the remastered version."
62532,Both of the South Park games.
62533,I fell in love with Elder Scrolls Online when I found out you could play it in first person.
62534,I think you mean open world adventure games
62535,"Hype aside the Witcher 3 was a hell of a ride, start to end."
62536,"The Witcher for Western-RPG, Persona 5 for JRPG"
62537,Persona 5 is probably the best modern age jrpg. Dragon quest xi is excellent to. If you aren’t into jrpgs then I would recommend the Witcher 3.
62539,"I just got Kingdom Come Deliverance for 20 bucks last week and I'm really enjoying it. It doesn't always perform that great on my OG ps4 but other than performance, I think it's really great. It's really deep and has a pretty big learning curve, but it's pretty rewarding once you start getting the hang of things"
62541,P5 obviously.
62542,"Regular RPG - The Witcher 3

JRPG - Persona 5"
62543,"Persona 5

&#x200B;

Dragon Quest XI"
62544,Absolutely The Witcher 3
62545,I mean. Hands down its witcher 3 there is no contest.
62546,There is contest.
62547,"TIL that the term RPG is used very loosely.

I actually searched for a definition and I found this:

""A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting, that can interact within the game's imaginary world.""

So pretty much any video game is an RPG according to that.  

""Play Pac-Man, an RPG where you assume the eponymous role of Pac-Man in the games imaginary world.""

No wonder there's so much confusion. 😁"
62548,"I was thinking the same thing this weekend after going through another sub (I think PS3 something something) where people were hair-splitting RPGs, ARPGS, and JRPGs."
62549,"Personally, I think an RPG is a game that has clear roots in table top RPGs like D&D, etc. Not just a fantasy setting, but some form of character attributes, stats and leveling up systems.

IMO."
62550,Dark Cloud 2
62551,"All the information on this thread is incredible and extremely useful, so up to date. Please feel free to vote up this thread to make it more searchable on Google :)"
62552,Nier Automata or Persona 5
62553,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game that had the disservice of coming out the same year as Breath of the Wild and doesn't get enough credit because of it.

It's a great game and a great RPG. Definitely worth getting it."
62554,"Persona 5, and I don't even like JRPG's that much. It's such a fun game - likable characters, interesting story and is stylish as hell with some cool visuals and amazing soundtrack."
62555,"Witcher 3, Bloodborne and DS3"
62556,witcher 3 and it's not close
61555,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

61556,">Persona 5

I second this!"
61557,"> Bloodborne

this is the first time i'm seeing somebody call Bloodbourne an RPG"
61558,BB and DS are all technically RPGs
61559,i guess i feel thats really stretching the term RPG but alright
61560,"It doesn't seem like a stretch. Leveling up, choosing different stats to build based on what weapon or armor you want. That brings up the variety of apparal and weapons to be found. A lot of factors make it an RPG."
61561,so with that logic God of War is an RPG
61563,huh. ok.
61564,"From wikipedia: ""Bloodborne[a] is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4."""
61565,"huh, well i don’t know much i agree with that but alright then"
61567,"an action game. it’s not really comparable to an RPG like, say, The Witcher 3. 🤷🏻‍♂️."
61569,I guess leveling up = rpg nowadays? Not like you can role play in bloodborne so idk
61570,As opposed to something like TW3 where you're a predefined character. Where's the role playing in that?
61571,"What a bad argument lmao, at least you actually are a character in the Witcher 3. As opposed to blood borne’ nondescript entity whose sole purpose is to swing weapon."
61572,What you just described makes bb sound more like an rpg than the witcher lmao
61573,Then you have no idea what role playing is
61574,"Your predefined sure but you can choose to act however you want. Ruthless or be the ""good"" guy or in between, you know role playing. You dont get those choices in bb you always kill everything in your way except for a few npcs"
61575,You can do that in Bloodborne too
61576,No you dont. You cant even sympathize with a few bosses and keep them alive instead youre always forced to kill them when you meet them
61577,There’s plenty of characters you can choose to kill or not. Not talking about bosses.
61578,I don't think decisione are the defining factor of an RPG

Others I'd recommend: Sekiro, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Fallout 4, Diablo III

I'd also strongly recommend Gravity Rush 2 to fill your free time."
61592,"Stardew Valley as RPG is certainly a weird flex (at least, I don't consider it a RPG...) but I'll be damned if that game isn't worth recommending."
61593,"You are literally creating a custom character to play the role of a farmer in a small town. You level up, dungeon crawl, and select classes (trapper, farmer, artisan, etc.), you form NPC relationships, complete quests, and the overarching story is a hero quest to defeat a megacorporation from ruining your familial land inheritance.

Of course Stardew is an RPG."
61594,i'd argue Stardew is a bonafide RPG while Bloodbourne.....isn't really an RPG.
61595,Bloodborne absolutely is an action RPG
61596,ha well to be pedantic i suppose that means God of War could be an answer to this thread because that has a lot of the same elements
61597,Pretty sure an RPG is just any game with a player progression system. Its very loosely defined.
61598,"i consider that loosely defined to its detriment for sure. when somebody asks me what their favorite RPG is it would be weird to see somebody say ""God of War"". i mean hey, whatever, but it's just weird to me."
61599,Yeah the term is definitely being stretched by some people. It's like trying to call pop music rock because there's a guitar somewhere in it.
61600,"There's been a definite trend towards RPGification of many different game genres ever since 1996, when RPGs suddenly became popular outside of Asia. I agree that they could use more strict definitions."
