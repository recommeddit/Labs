33814,"worst: any Kanto game

best:cant decide between ultra sun/moon or oras"
33815,"Best Story: Black and White

Best Overall: HGSS or Gold and Silver (for my purists out there!) 

Worst Story:  Sword and Shield

Worst Overall: X&Y"
33817,"Best: Pokémon Heartgold, hands down

Why: Fking two regions, a great rival that has developement, awesome music in nearly every screen, an enormous Pokédex where you can link up with 3-4 other games to get the Pokémon you need and enough ""pushes"" too keep your interest in the game.

Worst: Pokémon X/Y and partially Pokémon Sun/Moon

Pokémon X/Y (from what I remember, I borrowed the game); shitty story with forced tear-jerk ending, a weird ""power"" system that made no sense, fucking starter Pokémon thrown your way with no effort and characters where I don't think I even remember the main one.

Pokémon Sun/Moon: Not terrible, but extremly watered down by a mile. It's so bloody easy  to fill the Pokédex (without trading even you get 70%), the liga/competitions are a joke if you are already used to the franchises ins & outs and if I hear Lilly complain ONE GOD DAMN MORE TIME that she wants to become a Pokémon trainer without ever becoming one (which would have been an interesting developement) I'll scream.

However, it has it's peaks though: the islands were new, even though very simple, I loved the variety of the islands competitions (not just; beat trainer up), the crazy characters (Bromley/Guzma & Yasu/Nanu are best <3) and...as dumb as it sounds...I really loved the dress-up feature. Idk why, but I just adore that feaure."
33818,My favorite Pokémon game is emerald because of the great new Pokémons. My least favorite is X&Y because It’s not that fun and I never really liked mega evolution.
33819,"Easily b2w2, I can't seem to figure out how I had so much more fun in unova than any other region, there is something about this region that I can't express even if i try"
33820,W
33821,"The **Best** Pokemon Game for me is Heart Gold/Soul Silver.  
I personally feel they encapsulate all of the best aspects of the Pokemon series.  
\- Great spritework.  
\- Retelling of the Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal story, which was great.  
\- A wide variety of Pokemon available to you to use (Gen I - IV), where plenty of them are just straight up available ingame, requiring fairly minimal transferring to complete the National Dex.  
\- Following Pokemon.  
\- Excellent endgame (the entire Kanto region).  
\- Gym Leader rematches.  
\- Uses the Gen IV improved Physical/Special Split, which really makes Pokemon battles make sense.  
Really the only letdown in Heart Gold/Soul Silver is that the games still suffer from the Johto difficulty curve. It has been improved for the later game, where a lot of the Kanto Gym Leaders have been improved, but it still could be a little more balanced away from the Players favor.

The **Worst** Pokemon game is easily Sun and Moon.  
They are redundant games that were clearly rushed.  
\- The Totem Pokemon are dumb and boring.  
\- Z-Moves are nothing special, and are a significant step down from Mega Evolution.  
\- The games are *SO* easy.  
\- There is *way* to much handholding in every area, though it is particularly bad on the first island.  
\- The linearity throughout the islands is ridiculous.  
\- The story is retold, and retold better in the Ultra games, making the originals looks like a big waste of time and effort.

I'll honorable mention Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire for best games, since;   
\- they basically perfect Hoenn's adventure.   
\- they handle Mega Evolution relatively well.  
\- they look great.  
\- the PSS was a solid feature that was perfected by them.  
\- the Delta Episode was cool af.  
I just can't put them at the top since I still feel Heart Gold/Soul Silver just do everything (except maybe the PvP) just a *little bit* better."
33822,"Best sun and moon or Gen 5. There the only pokemon games with actually good story. Handles child abuse well. Sun and moon is challeing if you remove the exp share and I love the trails and totem pokemon because it does something different than the gym thing we had for so long. Unnova has best villans Ghestis and N. Alder the champion has pretty good chacther development and Iris is some of the hardest champion.  

Worst Gen 6 

&#x200B;

In gen 6 I played without the exp share the gym leader have bad movsets and most only have 3 pokemon despite there being plenty of pokemon. By time you have mega Lucario fully evolved your starter and mega kanto starter gym leader still use wepinbell emoga magneton Mewostic and other weak pokemon. Mega is a interesting idea only 4 people use it kora is tutorial and you only need 2 hits to beat her. Serna does have mega until post game and her absol only can use slash and quick attack just get a ghost type teach it toxic curse or will wisp and you win. The champion is barely there and when she is it's more focused on lysandre than her and she is easy rivals are boring etc. I probably would not hate this game so much if it did not come after platinum and Unnova."
33823,"In my opinion pokemon White/Black and White2/Black2 are the best pokemon game. If you want something new I would suggest pokemon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon for Nintendo 3ds, you don't have challenge mode but they are pretty good.

Pokemon X/Y are onestly too easy, and Sword and Shield are pretty easy and ""unrefined"", but I don't have the espansion pass so I don't play the complete experience."
33824,"ORAS is nice too. And for the sword n shield dlc, part 1 is trash part 2 is awesome"
33825,Are there many differences between the omega version and the old one?
33826,"Mmh there is a new chapter after the league. The sky tower is no more a challenge, and there is no Battle Frontier. But is not a bad game, still a remake and if you want to try something new..."
33827,"I just need to choose if i am going to play the old one or the remake, i think i m going for the remake, thanks"
33828,"To be fair, I don't think there was a battle frontier in ruby and sapphire either."
33829,"Plus, let’s not forget how the Black/White games singlehandedly have one of, if not the very best soundtracks of the entire franchise"
33830,"kanto and johto you should play the remakes instead. for hoenn they are different enough so you might want to play both. personally i go by release order:

firered/leafgreen -> emerald -> platinum -> heartgold/soulsilver -> black/white -> black2/white2 -> xy -> omega ruby/alpha sapphire -> (sun/moon optional) -> ultra sun/ultra moon -> sword/shield

ultra sun ultra moon are enhanced versions to sun moon similar to emerald and platinum. their story are 75% similar, but most agree sun moon has the better story but ultra sun ultra moon are better in every other way. if you really want to play sun moon for the ""different"" story, at least pick the opposite version so you can get the exclusive pokemon (sun then ultra moon or moon then ultra sun). if not just stick to ultra sun ultra moon."
33831,Wow that's exactly what i was looking for thank you a lot!
33832,"I’m going to suggest emerald and platinum.
Emerald has some would say too much content which I find great and platinum is in my opinion the best, gem four is really good and I hope they get remakes"
33833,"I agree out of what i've played platinum is the best, thanks"
33834,I really like the sinnoh games and you should try out platinum
33835,Platinum is my favorite too
33836,All of em
33837,"Ideally you at least play all of gen 3-5. These games are expensive and riddled with fake copies though. Still it’s worth playing if you can get real copies.

Emerald and platinum are the best of their trio, and then get one of every other duo.


Heartgold/soulsilver of gen 4 is imo the greatest Pokémon and very much worth a play.



Regarding remakes, I’d say fire red/leaf green and Heartgold/soulsilver perfectly replace the originals.


Omega ruby and alpha sapphire unfortunately cut content from the excellent emerald version. 


They also have a different style and some changes to the story. It’s like a bit of a reimagining of the originals, and not as direct a remake as the other remakes. So it’s worth playing emerald and omega ruby/alpha sapphire."
33838,Thanks a lot
33839,Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire. They were high quality and have a Rayquaza post game story. Mega evolution was at it’s height during these games.
33840,"Never played with mega evolutions, hope i like it, thanks"
33841,"Many people consider different games as the best Pokemon game, which usually include HGSS, BW + their sequels, Emerald, Platinum, and others. You could probably pick one that sounds the most interesting, though older games tend to lack quality of life changes that the newer games have introduced (such as not having unlimited use TMs before BW)"
33842,Which ones do you think is best? BC that's still alot of games to choose from. Want to see if I can narrow it down a little more. Might play all of them at some point I just don't know where to start.
33843,I think you should go with Platinum for now.
33844,"Yeah, the Sinnoh games are excellent. They have a sort of sharpness or cleanness to them that I feel HGSS lacks. It could be nostalgia, though; Pearl was my first video game."
33845,"You could try Black or White. An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn't have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you're new to the franchise, that's not really a big deal. After that, assuming you enjoyed either game, you could move on to Black 2 or White 2 (sticking with the same color for story reasons) which *do* feature older Pokemon throughout the main story."
33847,You could go Black 2 and White 2 immediately if you want to see some Pokemon from the earlier generations.
33848,"What makes this difficult is that you're looking at it though a lens that nobody else is. Each of us got into the series in different games and like the things that are present in the game that made us fall in love with the series.

You seem to like moon, which is story heavy, I would point you towards the latest games for that, from black on.

I like the gameplay and freedom of the originals, to me Crystal and SoulSilver represent the pinnacle of the series (the original formula refined), and I dislike the newer entries.

It all depends on what you like about pokemon."
33849,I beat Pokemon Red like 3-4 times back in the day. Definitely my favorite. Not sure how it would hold up to a new player though.
33850,"The remakes (Fire Red / Leaf Green) hold up a lot better than the originals, IMO (and I played the originals the first time around!)"
33851,I might give Fire Red a try then
33852,"BW2, Platinum, and HGSS all represent the peaks of the series for me."
33853,"People generally categorize the Pokemon games into their favorites. Here’s what I think are the best games per region, and you can choose from there:

Kanto: The Gen 1 remakes (FireRed and LeafGreen) are very friendly to newer players, with an on-demand help menu and the Teachy TV as an accessible tutorial. It could be a little weird to go back, since these are the only games on the list before the physical-special split, but I recommend it for the best Kanto experience.

Johto: Definitely go with HeartGold and SoulSilver for this one. The remakes add so much more functionality (an automatic run button on the bottom screen!) and refine Johto’s wonky late-game. There’s also the most stuff to do after you beat the game. If you’re dead set on transferring everything up to Moon, it might be easier to buy the virtual console of Crystal, since it works with the Poke Transporter out of the box and gives everything you transfer up its Hidden Ability, including legendaries like Ho-Oh, Celebi, and Suicune.

Hoenn: My personal favorite Pokemon game is Emerald. I love all the Pokemon in this region, a lot of the routes, and the music is very good. The remakes (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire) have a better selection of Pokemon, remasters of all the music for better or worse, and some of the best features like sneaking, analog movement, and the DexNav. Both of them are good.

Sinnoh: Platinum is your best pick outta these three. Most people’s complaint about Gen 4 (aside from not having many fire types besides Chimchar) is that battles take a while. Platinum’s refinements makes the game faster overall. Oh, yeah, and the better selection that comes with every remake. It’s worth noting that this generation introduced the physical-special split, which you’d only have to worry about otherwise if you play through any of the Virtual Console games or the Kanto remakes.

Unova: Well, Unova is a doozy. Black and White 2 are direct sequels to Black and White (Johto is the same type of deal with Kanto, but the stories of B2W2 require knowledge of the games before them). I think that with the increased selection and increased amount of things to do, the sequels stand better than the prequels as games, but both may be to your liking. The prequels made big improvements to the system as well, such as TMs becoming unlimited-use and Hidden Abilities. If you like story, play through Black or White, and if you liked that get the sequel to the color you chose. Oh, and also: if you want to move up your Pokemon from Sinnoh or the Johto remakes, you’ll need to beat a Unova game and go to the Poké Transfer Lab to do that. Once in generation 5, you can use the Pokemon Bank to zip zop zoobity boop ‘em into there.

Kalos: Well, there isn’t really much of an option here. I’d say X and Y have a comparable amount of story, and that the focus is on the gameplay more than anything else. To me, the story makes more sense if you get Y, for reasons that become clear at its climax. This generation has some of the best quality-of-life features, like the PSS (which is also in the Hoenn remakes) and a GTS that still works. And moving your Pokemon from XY to Sun and Moon is as simple as depositing them in from one and dropping them into the other! 

Alola: You already know this one. I would recommend playing through Sun or Moon for its story, and then playing through Ultra Sun and Moon for its gameplay improvements. The standard increased selection and “more to do” applies to USUM, and to me it feels like a more complete game."
33854,"Personally it has to be Emerald, currently imo it has the best rival gang fight that makes sense. Magma wants Groudon aqua wants kyogre.
Both gangs achieve their desired achievements, something other generation gangs can’t say.
And unlike a some what mediocre plot to stop the bad guy ( platinum was just garitina coming out of no where) (6 was basically hey u broke in take this legendary) , u has to go all the way to sky pillar wake rayquaza and stop the madness that took place in hoen.
Not only that there was a refreshing after game. And I mean extremely, the fact that safari zone expanded to include gen 2 Pokémon and the fact you can do the battle frontier , and the grand Mac daddy fight of  stone the elite champion. 
Other generations can’t compare gen 2 Crystal is the closet imo with the fact that you can go both lanzo johto and follow suicine.
My rank 
Gen 3 
Gen 2 
Gen 6 
Gen 4
Gen 5 
Gen 1 ( says a lot since I was 5 during red/blue)  
Gen 7 ( extremely bad imo)"
33855,"Honestly there are way too many issues with gen one for me, nostalgia goggles came off with the virtual console release, however the remakes solved a lot of these problems and made the storyline much more enjoyable imo"
33856,"You know that’s exactly what I said, at the time I’m sure it’s great, but a few years ago I found my red and yellow game and I tried playing it I couldn’t like it was just terrible, animation was piss poor, color is terrible, psychic type off balance etc. I think it’s amazing how gen 2 foxes all of that and went above and beyond with beautiful scenery and increases depth and plot. And I agree as well lead green is the only game where I caught all 150 Pokémon."
33857,"My personal favourite is Crystal. But as a new player, the graphics may be a bit of a turn off so I would suggest Heart Gold/Soul Silver which are just remakes of the Gold/Silver/Crystal (Gen II) games. 

My next choice would be Emerald (Gen III)."
33858,"I agree, crystal is the best game in the series.  
It perfected the original formula but also introduced some of the more engaging story features that the later games hinge on.  
Plus a end game that no other game in the series has yet to match short of HG or SS which are still missing the aspects that made Crystal great."
33859,"Okay,so generally it's considered that HeartGold/SoulSilver are one of the contenders of the best Pokémon title,although you probably should play Red/Blue/Green/Yellow or their remakes FireRed/LeafGreen before them.


So another one that is generally considered one of the best Pokémon games is Platinum,which is what I recommend you play next.



Black 2/White2 are also some of the best games in the series,but you need to play Black/White before them,which are also highly praised.But they only contain Unova Pokémon till the post-game,so maybe you should get Platinum first to first learn more about the previous Pokémon?Or maybe not.




There is also Emerald,the third version of Ruby/Sapphire,and there are also their remakes OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire.Some say Emerald is better and others think ORAS is better.I personally recommend playing ORAS instead of Emerald,and you can go play that one later.




I think that's about it for now.You should go play Platinum.:)"
33860,"I'm a big fan of Crystal Version. It just re-released a couple of days ago on the Virtual Console. I also love yellow version, it's from the first generation of games and has taken a lot of inspiration from the anime(you start with Pikachu instead of picking a starter, you get the other starters throughout your journey, Jessie and James from the anime show up). It, along with Crystal and the other Gen 1 games (Red and Blue) and Gen 2 (Gold and Silver) can be played on the 3DS and the Pokemon you catch can be sent to your Moon version. 

I like those games for nostalgia purposes, but if you were to ask me which games have the objectively best stories I would say Black and White and their sequels Black 2 and White 2. These games have a much more mature story than the other games and touches pretty heavily on the ethics of the Pokemon World."
33861,"> Which other pokemon games are worth playing?

All of them. Thanks to nostalgia most people's recommendations will be whichever game they played first, but if you've only played Moon I'd recommend either XY or ORAS next. Going back several generations at once can throw you for a loop with old mechanics. It's harder to judge a game fairly when you're diving straight into it after being spoiled with the QoL of newer games.

> Which one has the best story?

From what I've seen, BW is considered one of the series's strongest stories, and I'd agree with that. (In terms of story, it's best to play BW before B2W2; other than that all the games can be played in any order.)"
33862,"First game as best game isn’t necessarily true. I started with Yellow, but my favorites are Black and White."
33863,"Okay this is to everyone who mentioned Emerald. 

So if I understand correctly Emerald is a better version of Ruby and Sapphire or something alone the line? Then what about Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are they better than Emerald?"
33864,"Yes, Emerald in general, is the better version of Ruby and Sapphire. ORAS are the Nintendo DS remakes of Ruby and Sapphire. There’s a lot of new and modern features is the remakes that would make it more appealing, also mega evolution (if you’re into that). But choosing which one is *best* would differ person to person."
33865,"Emerald is still better than Omega and Alpha. If you have no objection to emulating games, you could download a GBA emulator and a base ROM of Sigma Emerald (downloading the base ROM, or pre-patched version, is easier than patching it yourself IMO). Sigma Emerald has many quality of life features (phys/spec split, auto-renew Repels, etc.) from the newer generations, as well as Mega Evolution, Fairy-types, etc. while still retaining the base gameplay and charm of the original Emerald. I'm not allowed to link you a base ROM of Sigma Emerald *on this sub*."
33866,Definitely a toss up between Platinum or B2W2.
33867,C O L O S S E U M B O Y S
33868,"Emerald was one of my favorites for sure, so I enjoyed the ORAS remakes, a lot of good features (and dexnav!)."
33869,"Honestly if you're looking for a good starting point I'd just go with the Gen 1 remakes (Fire Red and Leaf Green). Every subsequent set of games builds on the previous set in various ways, so Gen 1 is the most straight forward experience. The remakes add a lot of quality of life changes, so *definitely* play those over the actual original games. 

If you just want to cut to the chase and play the best, then Black and White 2 or Heart Gold and Soul Silver is probably what you should go with."
33870,"In my opinion Gen 5 (BW and BW2) are the best games, but it's up to preference. If you're new to the franchise, I'd suggest you play Emerald, then Platinum, then Gen 5. 

Emerald is an oldschool game but still a lovely region and interesting lore and story, plus if you're into that sort of thing it has a great postgame with the battle frontier. ORAS remakes were nice but I think the old graphics etc add to Emeralds charm a lot, I had no problems replaying it recently.

Many people think HGSS are the best games ever but I'm rather critical of them, and if you never played a kanto or johto game before the nostalgia factor for you is 0 which plays a large part in why HGSS are so well liked.

Don't listen to me on this but in my own biased opinion you can basically neglect anything after Gen 5 except maybe ORAS if you liked Emerald. Kalos has been a huge disappointment because the story is lackluster and the regions feels unfinished and empty."
33871,"HG/SS and BW2 for single player, USUM if you care about online play at all."
33872,"Hard to say which is best but I’d probably say platinum due to its challenge, pacing, and story being some of the best it’s been in the whole series. HG/SS, BW2, and Emerald are also great as well"
33873,"I recommend the following: 
Fire/red/leafgreen (can be played on DS lite), followed by heartgold/soulsilver, platinum, emerald (original), followed by the other pokemon games in order of release (Black/white, black/white2)

If you don't want to jump between graphics of newer/older games move emerald (original) to immediately after firered/leafgreen 

Honestly, I absolutely adore Gen 1-4 and I would STRONGLY recommend for any pokemon fan to experience Gen 1-4 
A lot of people say Gen 5 has the best story but Gen 5 is my probably least fav. gen and I really hated the pokemon designs of this gen. It was the only gen where I hated the starter pokemon (but I will admit the story is interesting and the game has a good difficulty level)

Gen 6 (X/Y) felt weak to me and story was too short, the game was too easy, the evil team lacked any charm to make them memorable. Honestly, you could completely skip this gen and it would make zero difference but if your a hardcore fan, you'll probably still come back to play X/Y...actually, looking at everything as a whole, I would rank Gen 6 as the lowest, and Gen 5 slightly above it for having an engaging story and large amount of post-game content 

Final note: it would probably be really difficult to get your hands on a legit copy of firered/leafgreen and emerald now so BEWARE OF FAKE GAMES 

EDIT: If you can't get your hands on firered/leafgreen/emerald immediately, start with platnium. You can also play heartgold/soulsilver BUT won't understand all the references without playing Gen 1 (firered/leafgreen)"
33874,"While I've enjoyed the main series I felt Sun and Moon were the weakest I played and I spent the most time on Dimond, Pearl, and Platinum (600+ hours alone on Dimond). My absolute favorites though are Pokemon Snap on the N64 and Pokemon Coliseum and XD Gale of Darkness on the GameCube"
33875,"you see the monster meme ? well...

the monster : me 
the weapon : nostalgia 
the tip of the weapon : pokemon black and white 1 
the adventurer : this post 

nothg else to say."
33876,"The monster: Me

The weapon: Nostalgia

The tip of the weapon: Pokemon black and white 1

The adventurer: This post"
33877,"Black & White and their sequels for story, Heart Gold and Soul Silver for gameplay. Since you already have a 3DS for Moon you can play those without having to buy another system, as you would for Emerald."
33878,"They are all really fun games in my opinion. It’s hard to pick just one. You should watch some gameplay videos on YouTube to decide which one you think is the most interesting. But, no matter what you pick, you can’t really go wrong."
33879,"All, or at least one per release are worth playing. As for the best, that's gen 5(the sequels have more content but the full experience is better)."
33880,"Start with either diamond or heartgold. Diamond is good because there aren’t many Pokémon and also it is fairly easy imo. Heartgold has a lot more Pokémon because it has the gen2 Pokédex and I think also the gen3. So yeah, try both of them"
33881,"Its obviously Pokemon Channel, since its the only Pokemon game where you run a TV network."
33882,"Personally, my favorites are G/S/C/HG/SS

Red was my first game and I played it to death but by the time G/S/C came out I was a little bit older (maybe 11 or 12) and they were the only pokemon games I had until I was 18 or 19 so I spent many, many hours playing through them, and I appreciated them a bit more than Red as I was a bit older.

So when HGSS came out they were just remakes of my favorite games growing up.

So really, it's completely subjective and everyone will have different reasons for liking what they like.

Personally I also love FRLG, and RSE (I actually like these more than the remakes)

That said, I don't think I've played a Pokémon game that I didn't like, but yeah. My top 3 would be those ones."
33883,"When Pokemon Crystal came out, I considered it to be the perfect Pokemon game. Since then, more modern games have introduced great new features, but have always taken a step back in some aspects. Crystal is dated now, but only in terms of graphics. The core mechanics of Pokemon are all there. The only generation that actually improved on the formula for me was Generation 4 with the physical/special split and online capabilities."
33884,"My personal favorite is probably emerald, but ultra moon is coming pretty close to dethroning it."
33885,"In BW and onward the games are slightly more story focused \(meaning slightly more linear\), so they are easier to get into and complete. I recommend going back a gen and play either XY or ORAS. \(of course if your ok with basically the same game \[except the postgame\] your could play Ultra Moon/Ultra Sun"
33886,"For me, the best games overall (in terms of mechanics, design, music ecc..) are HG and SS, but Platinum and Crystal are not that far behind. FR/LG and Emerald are great too but maybe they're a bit old for you.
The new games are a little too linear for my taste but X and Y are not bad. BW and the sequels may have a great story and but i found the pokemon designs to be the worst of all gens. The real question here is: do you like retro graphics? If yes, than play all the games from starting from Gen1 so that you can have a clear picture if the evolution of the games. If not, well...it's a shame, really, but i suppose you could start from HG/SS, than Platinum and BW ecc...
If after playing the main games you became passionate about the pokemon world, try Mistery Dungeon Explorers of the Sky, one of the best pokemon games ever, and Pokemon ranger (to experience a different and enjoyable take on the standard formula).
Last thing: the classics are called like that for a reason, do not forget it, they are the essence of the serie, so give them a try when you feel ready and if like old graphics."
33887,"Not the best, but I do have recommendations on where to start.

Gen 1 Remakes \(Fire Red/Leaf Green\)

Emerald \(Gen 3\)

Black/White"
33888,"Mystery dungeon explorers of the sky is my all time absolute favorite pokemon game, it had great gameplay, a deep engaging storyline and  brilliant characters. It is absolutely a Must Play in my opinion"
33889,"In my opinion the best pokemon game of all time was pokemon colosseum, it is fully 3d and came out for the nintendo game cube, has a great dark story and very fun battles, all in the form of 2v2."
33890,"The best Game by far in my opinion is Emerald. Emerald has an amazing story line and great characters (all though May/Brendan are a little undeveloped) the Pokemon are amazing and Hoenn is the most diverse and exciting region and Ruby and Sapphire are almost as good (if you don't have an old GBA or emulator handy I'd recommend getting the remakes even though they are not as good, 

Black 2 White 2 is the worst games by far don't tell me there not because they are.

[emulatoronline.com](https://emulatoronline.com) this is a good virus free emulator where you can play emerald fire red and also platinum"
33891,"IMHO, the best game is PMD: Explorers of Sky, though that's not a main series game. As far as main series games go, they're all fairly good. As others have said, Bw->B2W2 had some of the best story. I did not like Hoenn at all, personally, so I'd recommend staying away from RSE or ORAS."
33892,"Omg I love that game! I always play as my 2 favourite a (Riolu and Shinx). But man, trying to get a specific starter sucks. 

I actually brought that game home from my parents over the holidays because I wanted to play it and it's fairly hard to find nowadays."
33893,"Pokémon HeartGold/SoulSilver 

That’s generation 2 remade and it’s the best remake of all time."
33894,Yeah I love heart gold but it's still expensive
33895,Most of them are.
33896,Honestly unless someone's a collector a bootleg or flashcart is better until Nintendo gives us a way to buy it again. No reason to promote those insane prices imo
33897,"I know.. if anyone wanted it used, it’s over $45 for the cartridge alone.. that’s so crazy!"
33898,"If you really want to get heartgold or soulsilver, you can probably homebrew a nintendo 3ds to get it, but I am not entirely sure whether that is illegal or not though."
33899,Sadly Nintendo games almost never drop in price
33900,"It's only expensive because it is an excellent game, and once it comes into someone's possession it is highly unlikely for them to sell it unless they are making a large profit off of it."
33901,"Gen 2 had the monster design space of 1 but had a much more interesting world that never completely grinds to a halt of ""fight Elite 4, buy items, repeat"" like Gen 1. So logically the remake HG/SS builds on that even further and it's just great.

Diamond/Pearl and Black/White are fun too. Probably have the most hours in LeafGreen"
33902,"I agree, Heartgold is my favourite pokemon game of all time, everything about it is excellent: the story, the battles, and the music. I really like the style of graphics and gameplay from everything from generations 1-5, and then generation 6 onward just isn't the right style."
33903,Gen 4 as a whole is the best imo but im biased
33904,I put so many hours into that Underground! So much fun! I would support a remake of Diamond and Pearl! : )
33905,"I hope that they remake diamond and pearl too (and hopefully platinum as well), but I will always be reminiscent of the graphics from before generation 6."
33906,"The best ones in the series imo is HeartGold/SoulSilver, OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire, FireRed/LeafGreen, and Black2/White2.

Which version you play of each gen doesn't matter, the only thing thats different is that some Pokemon can be exclusively caught in a certain version, which is only a problem if you plan to 100% the game."
33907,I'll say anything from Gen 3 (So Ruby-Sapphire-Emerald or FireRed-GreenLeaf). Most bull was already ironed out at that point and it doesn't have much unnecessary fluff added yet.
33908,"Pokemon Black/White

Very fast paced, interesting story (certainly not award winning, but still decent), lots of QoL things not in previous games, etc. It still feels great to play to this day. 

A lot of people say HeartGold/Soulsilver, but I personally think they're not that great. They are much more open ended than other games in the series; if that's something you like, maybe you'll like them more than i did."
33909,"I second black/white. I kind of consider them the pinnacle of the series given how much they're able to accomplish and how well-rounded they are. Great story, music, region, etc. It's also pretty technologically impressive for a DS game, especially after the rather basic 4th gen games (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, HeartGold/SoulSilver). All the pokemon sprites are fully animated which blew me away at the time.

Another thing is that these games (and their sequels) were the last Pokemon games with the ""old"" design philosophy where Game Freak added in a ton of extra stuff so that there was something for everyone. This amounts to everything from little minigame-based distractions to larger and more detailed areas with plenty of places to explore. Recently they have decided to just focus on taking the things that the majority of players will be doing, and just polishing them to an extreme. Sun and Moon suffer greatly from this as they feel lacking in depth even if the basic systems are very smooth.

So yeah, Black and White are great. The sequels, Black 2 and White 2 are awesome as well since they add a couple new cities and areas, and unlike most other pokemon ""sequel"" games, they actually continue the story from the previous ones so it's an entirely different experience."
33910,"Great everything but the fucking region you mean? Yes. 

Gen5 overhauled battling so much, the games had so much content. Just a really shitty story, with a shitty antagonist, shitty Pokemon actually tbh. Genesects story is fantastic though."
33911,"I didn't find generation 4 to be too basic, I found that it was good because it was relatively basic."
33912,"I was more referring to them on a technical level, with non-animated pokemon sprites and rudimentary 3d models. They're still pretty solid games overall, I was just very impressed with the technological leap between gens 4 and 5 considering they were on the same console."
33913,"I have a lot of Nostalgia since that was the first time I could afford a new game (had played tf out of Gold and Emerald while my friends had Gen IV), but I def agree Black & White was one of the best. I think simplifying it by starting over with 150 Pokemon was a genius idea. They were able to look at everything they've done and put the best parts of the previous generations into it without making it overcomplicated. The story was really unique too and so much better than previous ones. It's insane all the stuff they packed in a 6 year old platform, too. I loooved going on my computer to put the Pokemon in the dream world and even had freaking video chat!! Plus the entire design language for the game was so good with it's hexagons and perfect balance of monochrome with color touches."
33914,"Black and white were awful, second version is way better. Despite being the worst region and story.

First games are hell in all honesty."
33915,"Not sure who downvoted you, but I respectfully disagree. I didn't play B/W until about two years ago, and as someone that considered Gen 1 and 2 my favorites, with everything after being somewhat downhill, I think Black and White and the sequels have the most competent stories of the entire series. It did something different and exciting, I felt, with the evil team formula, and wove it more cohesively into your gym challenge than any other Pokemon game has before, or since, especially the climactic set piece during the Elite Four. If I remember correctly, you don't even beat the Elite Four until after you see the credits for the first time? My gripes with a lot, if not all of the Pokemon games, is that the world-ending crisis your child avatar is thrown into, somehow felt like a sidebar to you completing the gym/Elite Four Challenge, with the credits rolling after. B/W meshed them together in a way that I was pleasantly surprised by.  
  
To other complaints about the generation, I had only seen Pokemon designs like Klink and Vanilluxe lambasted, but I've found Gen 5 also introduced some of my favorite Poke designs like Galvantula and Chandelure, and while I'm not sure how I would rate the region overall, I felt like the geography was a departure from previous games, but also had half the world map locked until you beat the E4, meaning more post-game content.  
  
All that to say, I feel like B/W/2 have actually aged fairly well, and served as a great 'soft reboot' to the series, but probably not what I would recommend playing first."
33916,"the first one you play is the best one.

sapphire is my favourite, followed closely by diamond"
33917,"I prefer the second generation to the first, despite playing the first generation originally."
33918,Yeah i think first gen is the exception to that rule due to how broken the first gen was mechanically.
33919,Why? I think the first gen was the best.
33920,If you picked Charmander you had to grind to get past the first gym and psychic is objectively the best type.
33921,The only time Brock really required grinding was in Yellow. I always got me a Butterfree to beat him and then quickly abandoned him for a Nidoking or something.
33922,"That's the reason I would pick Charmander, really. It sucks that later games didn't use the starters as a kind of in-world easy/medium/hard mode selection."
33923,"The starters in Gen 1 were your difficulty selection.  It's kind of ingenious, actually.

* Bulbasaur was ""Easy"" because you have type advantage in gyms 1 and 2, and neutral until gym 5 (Sabrina)
* Squirtle was ""Medium"" because you still had type advantage in gym 1, but were neutral in 2 and weak in 3
* Charmander was ""Hard"" because you had disadvantage in gym 1 and 2, and got your first advantage in gym 4 (Erica)

Since then, however, they decided to keep with Fire/Grass/Water as the ""tutorial"" on type weaknesses instead of focusing on the best types to modify difficulty level.  It's still there just by nature of how many type advantages and disadvantages there were, but it was never tuned quite like Gen 1"
33924,"Wel for starters if your opponent has a psychic type in gen 1 how do you counter it? It's supposed to be weak to ghost types but due to a bug ghost types are ineffective against it. And anyway every ghost type in gen 1 has poision as a secondary and is thus vulnerable, similarly for bug, (with the exception of caterpie and metapod...) not that there are any strong bug moves.

Further making psychic overpowered is that there is only one special stat making psychic strong at attacking with and resisting such attacks.

Away from the op psychic type critical hits were based off of the speed stat meaning that any high crit chance moves on any moderately fast pokemon crit 99.6% of the time. It would be 100% but for another bug in the game, this same bug causes guranteed hit moves to miss on rare occasions.

That's what i can remember off the top of my head, but the op psychic type along with combined special were the main problems."
33925,Competitvely sure. Is there still a gen 1 competitive scene? Otherwise just beat the few psychic types in the game with whatever you like. I rarely had issues with Sabrina.
33926,"It’s really subjective because they’re all extremely similar games. When you strip away the graphics and the proper nouns, they all play basically the same. Whatever OP plays first will probably be a fine experience. I’d maybe recommend Fire Red or Leaf Green, but that’s probably just my nostalgia for Red/Blue talking. White and Black are excellent choices as well, and aren’t so new that they’ll break the bank."
33927,Let me guess. You are ... 22? Just basing that on my age and my friend's ages
33928,"24 on monday :P

first game i played was sapphire, first one i owned was diamond."
33929,Fire Red
33931,"Fire Red/leaf green is a remake of red/blue. They added some Pokemon and areas that are from silver/gold and changed some of the stats and what not. The game is a blast. I actually just finished a full run of fire red that I started out of the blue and can't stop playing. 

I also recommend PokeMMO. You can install it in Android and play online with people. You can choose what region you start in and can customize your characters appearance."
33932,"I cant find PokeMMO in the android store, any descriptions or ways to find it?"
33933,"Just Google it and go their webpage. You have to download the client from their site (Android only) and upload the required ROMs (fire red, emerald, black/white and heart gold/soul silver.)"
33934,"IMO, the creativity and fun spirit of Pokemon was gone after Gen 3. Pokemon became just another corporate moneymaker with orders to churn out content and make cash. Monster designs and anything resembling 'heart' or 'charm' was gone when they just started scribbling random lines, adding an eyeball to it and calling it a new monster. 

This is, of course, highly subjective. I was among the first wave of U.S. Pokemon players for the original Red / Blue version release, so am probably looking at it with some level of nostalgia. I played Fire Red as an adult, and found that it managed to hold my attention, even after years of my tastes in video games maturing."
33935,"> just started scribbling random lines, adding an eyeball to it and calling it a new monster.
> 
> This is, of course, highly subjective


Most definitely.  Gen 5 has an ice cream cone pokemon, Gen 6 has a key ring, but Gen 1 had pokeballs, pile of sludge, and magnets.  It's always been silly stuff with eyes on them, but nostalgia is a hell of a drug.  I'm afflicted with it, too."
33936,"For what it's worth, I started with red/blue way back in the day, and tend to be of the opinion that a game play stance, every generation is better than the previous. 

Somethings have definitely worn thin, like generic bird types, trubbish, etc. But mechanically they're very sound."
33937,"I'd say Pokemon Platinum, might be hard to find but it flows really well and has quite a lot of content."
33939,"I beat Omega Ruby a few months ago and grabbed both Ultra Sun and Y when they were recently on sale. Ultra Sun improves on some things (like TM's) but yeah, way too many cut scenes. I heard positive things about X/Y so I'm looking forward to that one."
33940,Any of the remakes. Go with something modern.
33941,"Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. 
I haven't played White 2 (the story is the same in both, only changes are the post story content) but I enjoyed Black 2 immensely, and I played it around 5 times"
33942,"Though for the best experience, you'll want to play the original Black and White first."
33943,"Agreed, though the story is inferior to Black 2 imo"
33944,"Wait, how are you supposed to pronounce it?!?"
33945,poh-kay-mon
33946,"Technically ultra sun and moon are the best games. The story is terrible, but none of the games have good story anyways, its all about gameplay. They are not sequels, so it really sucks for whoever bought the originals, they are improvements to the originals. But they make great games.

Heartgold and soul silver are still my favorites, but thats almost certainly nostalgia and the battle tower (post game challenge content)."
33947,"It's tough to say from a purely objective standpoint without adding a bunch of personal preference. I personally say yellow,(best of the first gen, doesn't matter what anyone else says) but that's because I played it when I was a kid. It's still fun to play, but the nostalgia factor is what really puts it over the moon for me. But for anyone who's never played pokemon its gonna feel pretty outdated. I've played some of the newer games too (if you want to think of pokemon black from 8 years ago as new) and I could just never get into it the same way. Felt kind of...clunky, for lack of a better term. Just didnt feel like a pokemon game to me for some reason. Might just be because I'm an old fuddy fuddy these days though. Honestly I'd say your best bet is to start with gen 3 (or whatever gen Ruby/Saphire/Emerald is) and go from there.  For me personally these games still retain whatever it is that  makes a pokemon game a pokemon game, but with some relatively modern features that make it feel not quite so outdated. Honestly whatever you decide any pokemon is pretty fun. Not Go though. Dont do that.
Also get an n64 emulator and get pokemon stadium  and snap. Two of the best mon games ever created."
33948,"I do agree with what you said, I think 3rd generation is fantastic, but I think op should got their respective remakes and not the original version."
33949,"I'll go against the wind and advise the first two generations. With the new graphics I felt like a lot of the magic was gone.

But it may be because I had aged, and I don't like the new Pokemon after 250+ anyway. They look like they have a lot less ""personnality"" and look a lot like each other.  
Also I listen to the music from the first two games regularly, but most of the music from the recent ones is unappealing to me."
33950,"Honestly if you want to play them in order, then go:

FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SS, depending on whether you want the OG battle frontier Emerald but ORAS are great, Platinum, B2/W2, Y and lastly Ultra Sun/Moon.

Avoid Ruby and sapphire, diamond and pearl, black and white 1 and the first sun and moon, please. I've played 1 from each and trust me, they're not worth it."
33951,Play PokeOne. Trust me.
33952,"Depends on the generation. Within each generation, the versions ar epretty much the exact same game, but each version has its own Pokémon that can only be obtained in that game and not the others without resorting to trading with other people."
33953,"you should try to start with either omega ruby/alpha sapphire or a game from generation 4 or 5. Most of the games in generation 4-5 are harder to find and quite expensive, but they are worth it."
33954,"https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9dcytd/looking_to_get_into_a_pokemon_game_and_was/

33955,"I'd suggest either Ultrasun/Ultramoon OR Heartgold/Soulsilver.

I'll be honest that I'd learn towards the last two I mentioned though. They generally encompass everything good about the games. Sun/Moon and the Ultra versions are good and the most polished ones, but it's story-heavy (lots of cutscenes, even though in Ultra the beginning is much faster) and the story is not even that good. Although, in that case, I'd definitely suggest to go for the Ultra versions. More content, more Pokemon, in general it's better. You don't need to play the original Sun and Moon to play it.

And for the last question: no, there's no reason to play the other version. Unless you want to complete the Pokedex, but in case of the latest games, there's always the online trades for that (online play is not available anymore in Heartgold and Soulsilver).

Another good one is Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. That ones had loads of legendaries you can catch in the post-game, but that could be my nostalgia blinding me since Sapphire was my first game, so naturally I loved the remake :p"
33956,"Personally I really enjoyed all of them but black/white and sun/moon, can't really tell why, I just didn't feel it. I'd recommend Heartgold/soulsilver or the sapphire and ruby remakes."
33957,"Yellow, Emerald and Gold/Silver. 

Yellow has Ash + Pikachu as player. Don’t think any other game has that. 

Emerald was just amazing. I think Hoenn was the last “good” region of Pokémon. 

Gold/Silver lets you play Jhoto and Kanto. Blew my mind when I was younger."
33958,"Hoenn had May, all you need to know.

She's hot af, especially in that Dewford episode.

Last good region was Sinnoh, trust me. Hoenn and Sinnoh just went together so well in the anime and games.

We didn't lose Brock, Brandon, Battle Frontier, or May. 


Sinnoh needs a fucking remake holy shit. Hoenn and Sinnoh for life."
33959,"LeafGreen and/or FireRed

It's a remake of the original Pokemon but in more palatable GameBoy Advance (SNES-style) graphics (using the Ruby/Sapphire engine).

That one is good to be introduced, or reintroduced, into the series. Gameplay-wise my favorite is Black/White. I like it more so than the later ones (Sun/Moon, etc)."
33960,Dragón Quest Va os the BEST and the ONLY Pokémon game. For other Pokémon game you can play Persona.
33961,Black and white is an excellent start. It was something like a soft reset of the series and is widely considered one of the best in the franchise
33962,Thanks for your advice :)
33963,"Honestly I'd invest in the remakes fire red or leaf green and then heart gold or soul silver cause they were great remakes. Just do one or the other in both.  Then Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire, then just go in order"
33964,I wanted to do this but firered/leafgreen are gameboy color titles and are not compatible with the 3ds.
33965,You honestly can find roms for them just to do that
33966,"Ah damn, the one game I suggest you start with you exclude."
33967,Which one is it?
33968,"HeartGold and SoulSilver, the remakes of Gold and Silver. They're honestly peak pokemon in terms of playable content."
33969,"I would recommend Diamond/Pearl, X/Y, or Usun/Umoon. I've heard Black/White is also pretty good but ive never played them."
33970,Isn’t it a little bit weird to start later in the series? Or does that not mater that much?
33971,Pokemon is a series that can be picked up at any point in the series. I started with Pokemon X and can still find enjoyment from any game in the series.
33972,"Anything from Gen 5 and Gen 6 are both good starting points due to their polish and just abundance of content (in Gen 6 that’s mainly in regards to ORAS). My personal pick for a newcomer would be X and Y, even though I much prefer Black and White"
33973,"Don't get Sun and Moon, UsUm is the same game with added dlc. Also, try going after the Mystery Dungeon games, my suggestion is the DS games because the 3ds games suck"
33974,"I’d say in any order really. 

HGSS BW2 ORAS USUM and you’ll be caught up with every generation."
33975,If you want a game that is also ridiculously easy for a beginner then I recommend Let's Go Pikachu And Eevee. But if you want something more challenging then it is Black And White as many have recommended here.
33976,"My recommended playing order

1- fire red and leaf green. No need to bother with the originals when the remakes are just better. FRLG are a great place to start. 

2- Black and White. Great game overall and is considered one of the best pokemon games. Has a great story and makes good use of the side characters. Its here at beginning because of whats later on the list


3- Pokemon platinum. Very solid game and has what is considered the most difficult champion. Just a better version of diamond and pearl. No need to get those.

4- omega ruby and alpha sapphire. The best of the 3DS era of pokemon and a very under rated pokemon game. Very fun and has great characters.

5- heart gold and soul silver. Probably the very best of pokemon, and has probably the most content. Is a semi sequel to FRLG which is why I put them on opposite side of the list seeing as how you will be exploring kanto again

6- black and white 2. Direct sequels to BW and ex0lorrs the same region which is why they are separated. Figures people could use a small break from exploring 1 region. Has the same quality as BW which is to say, it's a great game. If you can unlock the hard mode for it even better.

7&8-xy and ultra sun and moon. Whatever you dox dont get sun and moon. Ultra SM is just an upgraded version with the same story. There is literally no reason to get original SM. XY and USUM are what I consider the weakest entries in the series. Play them after you fall in love with pokemon cause they simply aren't as good as the rest of the list"
33977,First games.
33978,"Pokémon Let’s Go will probably be easier than Pokémon Sword or Shield, but Sword and Shield will be closest to the usual main game experience."
33979,"Both are easy, doesn’t matter"
33980,"My recommendation is either Sword or Shield (differences are minimal) or wait for Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl in November. They’re your typical Pokémon games with the formula that more or less have been in place since Gen 1, but upgraded/enhanced after 25 years. 

If you liked Pokémon GO and the catching system then I heard Let’s Go Eevee/Pikachu are good (plus I’m bias towards Kanto) but the experience won’t be traditional"
33981,A lot of people have said the let’s go games. I scrolled through a let’s play if Pikachu and figured it looked different enough from go to give it a try. I’ll use it to get a feeling for the games then graduate to sword and shield or diamond and pearl
33982,"It uses the same system to catch Pokémon from go, it’s the only game in the whole series to change how catching Pokémon works so it’s not really considered mainline.
Has cool features tho

Sword and shield is good for beginners too I feel (low difficulty and explains everything as if you’re new or young) i think it even shows you when moves are super effective during battle.

Not much else choice until diamond and pearl in novemember.

Someone correct me if I’m wrong but you can’t take Pokémon out of let’s go?
That’s also something to consider, if you get attached to a Pokémon in sword and shield you’ll be able to bring it with you to other games."
33983,I never played Let’s Go but I hope you have fun with it
33984,"The “Let’s Go” games are designed for beginners to the series. They aren’t the most exciting games and don’t pose much of a challenge, but they’ll teach you what you need to know and they’re highly interactive. 

The “Sword and Shield” games are basically the modern take on the main Pokémon games. They’re good if you’re looking to see the latest and greatest Pokémon currently has out there. They’re more difficult than “Let’s Go”, but that isn’t saying much since “Let’s Go” is mostly very easy.

The “Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl” games are coming out in November, and they’re the most traditional Pokémon experience on the Switch. They stick most closely to the original Pokémon formula, which some people prefer for various reasons, whether it’s nostalgia or simply because the traditional games were much more mysterious. This will probably be the most challenging of the 3 listed here, but it’s definitely not “too difficult” by any means."
33985,"Welcome to the series. 

The Let’s Go games are a great place to start to learn type advantage and basic battle strategies. They are a bit on the unique side with their catching mechanics, and only offer up the original 151. It is a little on the easy side, but it’s a very casual experience. 

If your looking to dive into the core series, then sword and shield would be a good fit. It offers the usual battling experience with lots of options in terms of team building. Online scene is still pretty strong, and the DLC adds in two new areas to explore. You don’t need the DLC to receive the Pokémon that were added in; they can be traded and transferred into your game. 

Hope this helps and have fun."
33986,Sword shield
33987,I'd say Lets Go Evee/Pikachu and if you really enjoy the games then I'd play either Pokemon Shield or Sword. Or if you want to wait to play an older generation game wait for Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl which comes out in a few months! :)
33988,"for your first game try Let's go Eevee or Let's go Pikachu. They're easier to navigate, takes place in Kanto which is the original region, and has some similarities to Pokémon Go"
33989,"Probably Sword or Shield.  The old games from gameboy are really solid though and I think you can get them from E-store.  Pokemon Silver was my first and favorite, probably my favorite just from all the nostalgia and how special it was to me when I was younger though.  Old games hold up well though if you get into it enough that you want to try a lot of the games.  The original Red and Blue are good but I feel like in Silver and Gold they worked out a lot of the kinks and the game is longer."
33990,Pokemon Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu
33992,Aye thank you!
33993,"Get the Let’s Go Games. You won’t be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of Pokémon. Plus, a second player can join which is nice if you have a child or a partner who wants to instantly join and leave. Just do not expect too much. I still hope for a Let‘s Go Johto game."
33994,Pokémon sword / shield once you’ve played those play sun / moon then x / y and so on
33995,"Depends on your comfortably with games like Pokemon.

Never even touched a turn based RPG or are planning to play with young kids? Let's Go 

Familiar enough with the concept? Sword and Shield 

Want something more old school with a modern twist? Wait for November and get Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl"
33996,"It's easily either B2W2 or USUM IMO.

34015,Black 2/White 2. There’s so much content and detail put into them. I recommend playing Black/White first if you want to understand the story better and get some extra content in B2/W2 for completing it.

34023,id say platinum for sure
34024,There is no best Pokemon game as it is up to opinion. My personal favorite would be Black and White
34025,"Black and white 2, for sure"
34026,Pokémon Platinum.
34027,"PMD Explorers of sky give it a shot one of the best games I ever played,"
34028,"I personally like HeartGold/Soulsilver the most, 2 regions and Pokémon following you is just awesome"
34029,"Am I correct in saying heart gold is a remake/remaster of the original gold? Gold was always my favourite when I started years back, would be amazing to play a remake!"
34030,"Yup, they're remakes of Gold/Silver and from what I remember they're pretty faithful to the originals"
34031,"Crystal is my favorite but damn it's bad lol

Second one is of course, Pokemon TCG 2 on game boy"
34032,Y
34033,Well that's a loaded question or a divisive sub.
34034,"My votes if you want a 3ds game and not a ds game would be either one from omega ruby/alpha saphire, or ultra sun/ultra moon. If you want a DS game either black 2/white 2."
34035,what would you say are the big differences between OR/AS and US/UM? I'm a complete noob so I really don't know haha. I assume just different pokemon and slightly different story?
34036,"Those are the big 2 differences, pokemon and story. My reasoning for USUM is because it's the most current game, it has the best ""support"" due to more active players. So if you continue to play their games post USUM you will be most up to date with game mechanics. The reason I say ORAS is even though it's a ""new game"" it is still a remake and besides the graphics update what they added core mechanics wise and post game makes it a blast. Plus both offer a TON of legendary pokemon to catch post game which is my favorite part lol."
34037,"haha fair enough, legendaries are always great to catch! i think I'll go with Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun. thanks for your input!"
34038,"That's the combination I always recommend to people that want to catch em' all.

You get a lot of coverage with that combination."
34039,"You can play DS games on the 3DS, so generations 4-7 are available to you. Skip Diamond/Pearl and Sun/Moon as Platinum & Ultra Sun/Moon improve on them in every way. Here's my ranking:

1. HeartGold/SoulSilver
2. Platinum
3. Black 2/White 2
4. Black/White
5. Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire (3DS)
6. XY (3DS)
7. Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon (3DS)"
34040,Also note BW2 is a psuedo-sequel to BW so if you want to play it chronologically for the story play BW first.
34041,I agree if you swap usum and xy.
34042,"Pokemon Rumble.

Serious, this has the best replay value of them all.   Plus you can play it in 3D."
34043,"There's also the Virtual Console option, you could try Yellow or Crystal. Only if you're feeling retro. 

X/Y are a good jumping on point into modern pokeman games for the classic formula.

Ultra S/M are more unique with their formula, not classic pokemon."
34044,"ORAS, Ultra sun/moon, xy, sun/moon"
34062,"I think I'll go with Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun, thanks for your input!"
34046,"Fair warning, few people like either version of sun or moon and I might be biased against x and y"
34047,X/Y are my favorite of the 3ds line! S/M and US/UM are good games too but you need to be very prepared for long dialogue. X/Y are beautiful first take into the 3ds Pokemon worlds.
34048,"Trick question but Ill try my best.

To add to this, I have a different list for which regions I loved the most. Though this is more aesthetic of the world based and less mechanically inclined.

&#x200B;

1. Jhoto (admittingly, this is mostly nostalgia goggles here)
2. Unova
3. Hoenn
4. Kalos
5. Alola
6. Sinnoh
7. Kanto

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know its controversial but to be honest I never liked shinnoh as much.

I decided this year to play every game in order of release (yes every main title ever) just to put things in perspective for myself and give DPPL a solid second chance. While I can appreciate it more now that people aren't hammering it as the best pokemon game anymore I don't feel the need to fight against its positives, freeing myself from some of the bias I had. Ill probably make a post in the future about this. Anyway even though I like sinnoh more than I had in the past I still like it less than X & Y. 

&#x200B;

X & Y were when the games got easier but I think some of the best improvements of the series were made during its implementation. They eliminated a lot of the grind that made an entry barrier for those who would often be too busy to make a competitive team. Destiny Knot became a godsend for breeders and I really hope super training returns because it made the most boring part of training Pokemon fun. Not to mention the jump to 3d. X&Y did A LOT right and I think its too often its not given the credit it deserves. This is more of an aesthetic thing but I think X and Y have some definite charm to it as well.

34052,"3DS games, not good ones"

34056,oras
34057,oras oras oras oras
34058,"ORAS would be my pick.  Gen 7 is alright, but a bit slow."
34059,Oras
34060,Moon is my fave but I haven't played Ultra Sun/Moon at all yet
34061,I would recommend either sun and moon or ultra sun and moon. They are the newest entries and are easy to jump into.
34071,Jerry rice.  He holds so many records and not by just a little.  But I am biased.
34072,"Not even the best receiver. Time to bone up on your NFL history, guys, because [Don Hutson](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HutsDo00.htm) was better than Rice.

In 1942 Hutson led the league in receptions with 74. Pop Ivy was second with 27. Hutson's 1211 receiving yards also led the league. Ray McLean was second with 571. Did I mention that he led in receiving touchdowns (17-8)? Points scored (138-54)? Yards from scrimmage (1215-758)?

And surely we haven't forgotten that his seven interceptions were only one fewer than the league lead. 

EDIT: Wow. I didn't realize I would strike such a nerve. I thought my dissent was reasonable, at least."
34073,"I always feel dirty comparing the two. While Don Hutson was definitely the more dominant player during his time, it was a completely different era. Both were excellent, but they really played a different game so I can't really see how anyone can say that one was better than the other."
34074,"I would tend to agree with you, but it seems to me that Hutson's name is rarely even brought up in these discussions. He deserves at least that."
34075,no he doesn't. the two aren't even comparable. they played in what are essentially two different leagues entirely due to the contrast of the eras they played in. jerry would've destroyed in Hutson's era. you know that. I know that. hutson would get owned in modern day football. it's like comparing a great high school player to a great pro.
34076,">hutson would get owned in modern day football.

Sure, if you magically transported him to the present day and disallowed him any benefits of using modern training techniques, nutritional science, and equipment. And how would Rice have played without all those things listed above? With a leather helmet and fewer pads. Without the West Coast Offense? With a quarterback completing 40% of his passes?

Since we can't know exactly how that would affect him or his game, it seems a silly hypothetical to me. We can really only evaluate players relative to their peers, and no player was more dominant relative to his contemporaries than was Hutson. That alone puts him in the conversation.

Do you think Babe Ruth shouldn't be considered the greatest baseball player of all-time?"
34077,That tends to happen when you play 20 years. Look at Favre
34078,"Favre was a great, great quarterback. People forget just how dominant he was back in the late 90s. 3 straight MVPs and a Super Bowl. None of those records were a fluke."
34079,I don't recall ever saying he was bad or that those were a fluke(although one of his MVPs probably should have gone solely to Barry).
34080,You don't stay in the league for 20 years by being shitty at what you do.
34081,"Vinny Testaverde played 21, didn't he? Also, who said anything about being shitty?"
34082,you don't start at a position like quarterback for 20 straight years being shitty at what you do... or anything less than elite for that matter.
34083,"Again, who said anything about being shitty?

Also, plenty of people played for 20 years while not always being elite. Even Jerry Rice was little more than a number 3 receiver in the twilight of his career."
34084,Steve Deberg played football for 20 years and who even is that?
34085,A journeyman QB who couldn't hold down a starting job? Is that really the same thing as Rice or Favre? Also didn't he set the record for lowest interception percentage in a season?
34086,No you were saying that by implying that playing for a long time means that you will shatter numerous significant records. And Deberg may have broken the interception percentage record I'm not sure. Anyway my point was Jerry Rice broke those records because he was great. Not only because he played for a long time.
34087,"I was glib, but he was great while in SF then was average-good the rest of his career.

So he broke most of those records due to being consistently good enough to be a starter for so long."
34088,"[He was dominant for 15 of the seasons he played.](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiceJe00.htm) Including a 12 game season in which he broke the touchdown record, and in the process doubled the touchdowns of the runner up that year. He was amazing. Incredible. Go watch any game with him in it from his prime(any of the 15 years he was a top 10 receiver) and tell me he didn't take it over."
34089,"Don Hutson dominated to a far greater degree, sometimes having more receptions/TDs than entire teams, and often more than the next 3 top receivers, AND he played defensive back, average 5 interceptions a season, which were 11-12 games."
34090,"Okay, I see your point. But longevity and the fact that the game was far different in that time has to play some part in the decision. I am not questioning that there are players out there possibly better than Rice was, but you made it seem as though he isn't, without question, which I believe is completely false. He was an incredible player and will always be regarded as one of, if not the, best player(s) of all time."
34091,"I didn't mean to imply Rice wasn't great because well, he was. I just disagree that he was the greatest player or even the greatest receiver to play. He certainly was among the greatest of either to ever play."
34092,Barry Sanders. Damn shame he never reached his full potential.
34094,"He absolutely did not reach his potential. He played with a God awful offense. If he had been with a team that actually could have blocked for him, or made it so he wasn't their only option, he would have demolished defenses."
34095,"Barry Sanders... the most elusive player in NFL history. I go back and watch his highlights occasionally just to blow my mind all over again... and every time I re-realize that there simply isn't anyone like him in the NFL right now. 

Just to show how dominant he was at the position, some career YPC averages for a few notable players:

- Marcus Allen - 4.1
- LaDanian Tomlinson - 4.3
- Tiki Barber - 4.7 
- Jerome Bettis - 3.9
- Emmitt Smith - 4.2
- Walter Payton - 4.4
- Barry Sanders - 5.0 - did I mention he was playing for the 1990's Lions?

Jim Brown and Jerry Rice come close, but [nobody's had moves like Barry.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsFhZy9oxuk&feature=related)"
34096,"Totally agree with noting he was playing with the 90's Lions, but the late 70s/early 80s Bears weren't that amazing either."
34097,"And then he just walked away. Like it was not even a big deal how good he was, such a boss."
34098,"Sometimes I think Ray Rice, on his absolute best runs, can come close to sort of appearing Barry-esque, but obviously Barry was the real deal."

34103,your joke makes no fucking sense up there.
34104,"well lemme break it down for ya sally. 
 You see, the part where it is the ""greatest of all time"" kind of plays into the greatest rappers of all time, in the part where the phrase ""greatest of all time"" is used.   
  I then take this similarity and place it into a situation.... and BOOM upvotes from people who get simple popular reference humor. For not picking up a play on words you sure do have the wrong username."
34105,Why wouldnt you just say 5? that would have made sense. and would have been funny.

34118,Nopenopenope
34119,"Wholeheartedly agree. I swear if he had the niners 80's offense, there would be more than two rings on his hand."
34120,"If Montana and Rice had the Giants defense, my god they would be unstoppable"
34121,80's Niners offense+80's Giants defense =/= losing
34122,"I agree 100%. Violence and fury concentrated into a single being so densely, there's nothing you can do about it."
34123,"No one quite changed the game of football like LT. Yeah, Rice has the records, Montana has the championships, Favre has the wins. Rice needed Montana, and vice versa. But none of them single-handedly changed the nature of the game quite like Lawrence Taylor."
34124,"Hopefully it won't be buried this time, but Don Hutson."
34125,I agree about Lawrence Taylor. He really made left tackles an important aspect of the game.
34126,Hadn't you heard? Tebow.
34127,"I have to say Tebow as well, and I'm not joking either. If you look at his entire body of work, all the games he's played (except the ones he lost) and all the passes he threw (except the incompletions and interceptions), then you can clearly see Tebow has never lost a game and has 100% accuracy. He rejuvenated a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl from 2010 to 2011 and brought them to the playoffs where they beat the defending Super Bowl champions (had they beat Green Bay last year.) Greatest of all time."
34128,You are basing that off of 2yrs. Lets see if he is consistent and if he can keep it up for at least another two years. He needs to win because of his QB skills not because of his defense for me to even consider him in that category.
