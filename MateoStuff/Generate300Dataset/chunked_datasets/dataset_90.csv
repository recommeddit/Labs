28797,Dude just poach them.
28799,"Yeah that’s fair, they’re not for everyone. I have this special made Tupperware thing that poaches them in a microwave in 45 secs, fits the description."
28800,"Does it leave the yolk runny? If so, I need one pronto!"
28801,Powdered peanut butter is also amazing in oatmeal and super easy to add.
28802,"Hard boiled eggs are basically the best food things ever, IMO."
28803,You don't have to cook the oatmeal. I eat it raw with almond milk and some brown sugar. Super quick.
28804,For clarity: http://www.outofstress.com/eating-raw-oats/
28805,Boil extra eggs and use them for several days.
28806,"***Baked Oatmeal!***

I make this on the weekend, and I've got a delicious hot breakfast ready in minutes. Add a little milk, or if you're feeling luxurious, add *cream*!

Once it's baked, I portion it out into muffin tins (sprayed with a tiny spritz of oil), and freeze them into meal-sized blocks that are microwave-ready.

https://www.budgetbytes.com/2012/08/blueberry-banana-baked-oatmeal/

**INGREDIENTS**

1½ cups (3 med) mashed bananas  
2 large eggs  
¼ cup white sugar  
¾ tsp vanilla extract  
½ tsp salt  
¾ tsp baking powder  
2 cups milk  
2½ cups old fashioned oats  
8 ounces frozen blueberries   
 
**INSTRUCTIONS**

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. 

Mash the bananas in a measuring cup, starting with two or three and adding more until you have 1.5 cups of banana mash.

Combine the banana mash in the large bowl with the eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine. Add the milk and whisk again until smooth.Stir in the dry old-fashioned oats. Lastly, stir in the frozen blueberries (keeping them frozen and stirring them in last helps prevent the entire mix from turning purple). 

Spray an 8×8 inch baking dish with non-stick spray and then pour in the oat mixture.

Bake in the preheated 375 degree oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the center is no longer wet to the touch."
28807,">stir in the frozen blueberries (keeping them frozen and stirring them in last helps prevent the entire mix from turning purple).

Where's the fun in that?!

Thank you for this: I'm actually feeling a bit motivated to do the shop & meal prep this week!"
28808,If you slice the bananas instead of mashing you get some excellent sugary roasted banana chunks! I love using frozen raspberries to add a little bit of tartness. And sliced almonds for a little texture!
28809,Thanks for this. Just looked up and had all of the ingredients in my pantry - used apples instead of blueberries. Took about 5 mins to prep and its in the oven!
28810,"Oooh, let me know how the apples turn out, I hadn't considered that. Did you add cinnamon?"
28811,It turned out great. Almost like an apple cobbler but not as sweet. I forgot to add cinnamon but that or honey would be an awesome addition. It was a good dessert replacement.
28812,"Have you considered baking directly in the muffin tin, instead of in a cake pan then transferring it into the muffin tin when it's cooked?"
28813,"I've thought about it, but haven't tried... The uncooked mix is very wet, and when I transfer it to the muffin tin I like to fill it a bit above the edges. Plus, it tends to expand a little when cooked, and I don't want an overflow disaster. (I may be overthinking this)"
28814,This sounded perfect to me until I got to the milk (I need wheat and dairy free breakfast).  Do you know if I can use an alternative to milk? Would water work?
28815,"Soy milk or similar works, too. Water would, too, but would make it taste somewhat less rich and satisfying."
28816,You can use any type of milk substitute that you prefer for baked oatmeal.  I pretty much exclusively use almond milk in my baked oatmeal recipes.
28817,"Many alternative milks made from soy, almond, coconut, hazelnut, oat, hemp.  Also creamers if you like something thicker--soy, almond, coconut being the most available.  I have a friend who swears oatmilk is like drinking a milkshake.  Personally I like almond."
28818,"I make a pan of egg casserole on Sundays and eat it all week. It's just 12 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tbsp olive oil, cheese, and whatever veggies you want to throw in. 375F for like 35 minutes (sorry for all the non-metric units). The whole thing costs less than $10 in the states. If you want it to be handheld you can get a storebought crust and make them into little quiche type dishes. It's very cheap and very easy to make.

Edit: for best results, throw the eggs in a food processor for about a minute. It makes the casserole crazy-awesome-fluffy. Also, I think eggs are one of those items that you really improve your experience by buying top shelf product. You can get a dozen for $1.50, or you can get one for $6 (direct from a farmer if you have the option). The $6 dozen is  significantly tastier, and it's still a great deal for the amount of protein you're getting.

Double edit: don't put tomatoes in unless you squeeze out their moisture first. It will make the whole thing runny."
28819,"Muffin pans make for smaller, individual servings."
28820,"Sounds good at first, but I personally prefer making one big casserole and just cutting into squares.  Muffin tins just add more complication and oven space for little benefit in my opinion."
28821,"Same here.  Eggs can be cut with a butter knife.  Plus, the size of one muffin would not be enough for me for breakfast 😉"
28822,"More pours = complicated? Also you get portions in a muffin tin, where you have to carefully cut and portion an entire pie: *thats* complicated."
28823,">you have to carefully cut and portion an entire pie: thats complicated.

Not really.  Eyeballing it is just fine.  If portions are off a bit, it’ll still average out in the end.

And if you’re *really* anal about counting calories/macros you’d weigh the portions, which you’d have to do with muffins as well.

Anyway, just offering an alternative opinion.  By all means go for the muffins if that’s what you like."
28824,"Eyeballing and cutting vs. just lifting it out the pan. Also, if pies of any sort that have less than solid interiors easily fall apart. Also, nothing to do with counting calories."
28825,"cutting... fine, i’ll give you that if you just really hate cutting.  falling apart isn’t an issue at all, eggs hold together really well."
28826,This. That's what I was trying to get at when talking about the storebought crusts. Thanks.
28827,"Ah, I thought you were talking about a larger pie version, which sounds good too."
28828,"I do a hash brown crust - get the dehydrated kind, hydrate them and spread in the bottom of the baking dish, bake for 10-15 minutes to get crispy, then pour the egg mixture in and finish baking."
28829,I've never heard of dehydrated hash browns. Picture or link? Sounds interesting.
28830,[I get mine at Costco](https://m.costcobusinessdelivery.com/Golden-Grill-Russet-Premium-Hashbrown-Potatoes%2C-4.2-oz%2C-8-ct.product.100106594.html)
28831,I've never seen hash browns package like that before. Cool! Thanks.
28832,"My in-laws take them camping, I was really sceptical when I saw dessicated hashbrowns in a milk carton, but they're surprisingly good.  Makes me think I've probably eaten them unknowingly at many diners because they taste like standard issue restaurant browns."
28833,What’s the shelf life? Do you just keep it in the fridge?
28834,Yup. It lasts at least the entire week.
28836,"You might not have had a good egg to milk ratio, or cooked them too long."
28838,"You may also want to consider a water bath, maybe the eggs are losing moisture in the oven."
28839,"I'd say just use high end ingredients. Whole fat milk from pasture raised cows, high end free range eggs, olive oil, all blended together in a food processor. That's really all I do. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful."
28840,"I'm pretty sure most other countries dont have as much disparity in egg quality as the US does. I cant speak for australia, but european eggs are generally much tastier than ours even if it isnt the top shelf stuff."
28841,"Yeah, I remember Japan having terrific eggs. Remove the factory farmed bullshit and you're left with terrific food."
28842,"Overnight oats work really well for me. I prepare it the night before and stick it in the fridge and grab it the next morning.

2 cups of oats


1 cup of frozen berries


2.5 cups of milk (I like to add a liiiiittle bit of water too)


1 tbsp of chia seeds


Honey to taste


Plus any other fruits (I like ripe bananas)"
28843,"I second over night oats! I hate most hot oatmeals, but love overnight oats and I spend about 10 dollars on ingredients every three weeks or so!

My recipe is a little different, because I don't like it too runny!

1/3 cup oats
1/3 cup vanilla greek yogurt (I use Dannon light and fit)
1/3 unsweetened vanilla almond milk
A sprinkle of cinnamon
And a sprinkle of whatever dried fruit sounds good (apples or blueberries are what I like best)

Then I mix it all together, let it sit over night and top it with 1/4 cup of granola. 

It's around 300 calories and keeps me full until lunch!"
28844,"Sorry to jump on your comment but I make 5 portions of overnight oats on a Sunday night to do me through the week. My recipe
50g oats
100g Greek yogurt
100ml milk (almond milk also works for taste)
25g nut butter
20ml maple syrup
That comes to around 550kcals, I'm work in recruitment so do long hours and I'm a competitive powerlifter so numbers may need to be adjusted"
28845,What kind of oats do you use?
28846,I usually use Robin Hood Quick Oats. They get pretty soft and mushy the next day.
28847,"Read up on OMAD (one meal a day) and IF. It can be very healthy to skip eating for a significant portion of the day. Don't eat if you're not hungry. Eating one large meal likely isn't as bad for you as you think, it can allow you to eat less in total but keep up your metabolism."
28848,/r/intermittentfasting and /r/omad
28849,"Egg ""muffins"" (mini frittatas) are handy,  you can make them and freeze for a quick reheat and go.  Making different flavor combinations means you get variety.     
Overnight refrigerator oats with chia and fruit. Yogurt.   
SMOOTHIES! Peel and freeze a bag of bananas, buy a big bag of prewashed mixed greens and freeze as-is (you just grab a handful,  they stay loose frozen), frozen fruit like berries.  Blend water or milk,  a frozen banana, handful greens, half cup other frozen fruit, a couple tbsp nut butter, or raw cashews or chia or hemp seeds, a few ice cubes.  Always good and filling.    
Egg sandwiches.
     
Big fan of leftovers for breakfast, you can put an over-medium egg on anything."
28850,this guys breakfasts
28851,"Someone a while back posted a protein pancake recipe made from oats, half a banana, and 4 egg whites. I've made it twice, adding in some of my own stuff, and it's worked wonders for me. If you want, I can link you the original recipe and my own modified version.

Also, oatmeal in general."
28853,"Just the og recipe? Here ya are:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/7ph5x3/easy_egg_white_pancakes/?st=JCNN3FG5&sh=ffbcdcc1

Add cinnamon, honey, and milk to your liking"
28854,"Do you work in an office, school, or somewhere with a microwave? *Make breakfast at work.* My very first job was in the office of a hunger relief organization and everyone there had a desk drawer that was a mini-pantry, complete with spoons, cups, bowls, etc. They taught me the magic of making breakfast at work to avoid getting up early or having to eat in the car. I’ve had two other jobs since then and my coworkers definitely thought it was weird at first but they all came around to building their own mini pantries. My current obsession is oatmeal (which many others have mentioned), so my pantry is full of nut butters, nuts (hazelnuts and pecans are my fave), apples, bananas, honey, dried fruits, maple syrup, cinnamon, chocolate chips (it only takes a few!), bacon bits, dried herbs, and SALT. ALWAYS ADD SALT TO YOUR OATMEAL NO MATTER WHAT THIS IS RULE #1. The oatmeal is super cheap and customizable so you’ll have something different every day. It takes exactly 3 minutes to cook in the microwave with water (or milk if you’re fancy like that). And if some of your ingredients are about to go bad before you can use them just share with your coworkers and hope they’ll eventually return the favor. Dang now I kinda wish I was at work so I could have some oatmeal....."
28855,"I make a cold oatmeal mush.  I take quick oats and grind them in the blender then add honey, milk and cocoa.  You can add whatever you like. - jam, cinnamon, etc.   I let it chill overnight till about yogurt consistently then put it in individual containers - about 1 cup.   It’s about 200 calories and really filling.  Less than $2 to make 5 servings.  I supplement this with a hard boiled egg and some fruit for a full meal."
28856,"Oatmeal is great! So are smoothies. 

Hot oatmeal tip: add a spoonful of peanut butter to your oatmeal. It adds extra protein and elevates the taste and texture 🤗"
28857,"Smoothies are generally very high in sugar due to the fruit juice, fruit and added sugar in yogurt - I’d be wary of that."
28858,"True. But I make mine with frozen spinach. Blitz w some water then add a banana and handful of frozen mango. That’s it. Very energizing and affordable. Ps, I’m a dietitian"
28859,Works! Just didn’t want that poor man making Jamba Juice style smoothies and thinking the internet led him astray. :)
28860,"I feel like this sub's demographic isn't using fruit juice or yogurt besides greek/strained yogurt to begin with, my usual smoothie base consists of dairy, fruit, and protein powder"
28861,"Hah no. Use fruit, not fruit juice."
28862,"[Here's](http://tipnut.com/hard-boiled-eggs/) how to make a large batch of ""hard-boiled"" eggs at once.  It's really easy, and you can put them back in the carton for easy storage."
28863,"I make a breakfast hash on Sunday’s that could go for three or four meals. Matty Mattheson’s Breakfast Hash recipe is about the closest thing to what I make. It’s as easy as sautéing a few things and baking for 15 mins. Takes about an hour in total to prep/cook.

I don’t use jalapeños or radishes, but add sausage (cooking before the potatoes) and any other seasonal veg I like!"
28864,"Oatmeal, spoonful of peanut butter and add boiling water. Taa daa! Easy, cheap, filling and yummy"
28865,"Nothing wrong with one meal a day: https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/
What you eat/drink for that meal or otherwise is probably more resultant on this belly of yours."
28866,nothing wrong with one meal a day? I am pretty sure metabolism largely disagrees.
28867,"There is nothing wrong with omad, but it isn't a good fit for everybody."
28868,"It's just a different routine and people don't like change... takes some getting used to. The liver stores enough glycogen for about 12 hours before shifting to fat-burning. Coffee with sugar or a glass of milk is all that's really necessary in the morning to replenish glycogen stores and keep metabolism from going wonky until dinner.
 
Edit: Wow, people really didn't like this comment. That's really weird. I mean if I'm wrong on how the liver's glycogen storage mechanism works, nobody's taken the time to correct me. My understanding is the a one-meal-a-day routine is perfectly healthy in the absence of conditions like diabetes or kidney failure. That's generally how I do things just out of habit... I usually just eat dinner and have maybe a muffin or a smoothie during the day, if anything. Keeps me from feeling like I need a nap after lunch if I just don't have lunch."
28869,"I have low blood pressure, if I go several hours without eating I start to feel faint and my hands tremble. It is not for everyone, you do you, but I can't work on my feet all day when all I have had after sleeping is coffee."
28870,"Hey everyone does things differently! I'm a mechanic and general contractor and just kinda naturally moved to eating light (if at all) during the day because, for me, it's tougher to squeeze under cars and into tight spots for plumbing and electrical with a full stomach. I also tend to get sluggish right after I eat and it slows me down. Even way back in high school, I skipped lunch a lot. If I have a big lunch, there's an hour or two I just don't get anything done haha. If I REALLY start feeling hungry, a smoothie will usually do the trick. I'm also on Wellbutrin to cut back on smoking, so that kinda kills my appetite even more.
 
It's a routine that works for me. I didn't mean to imply that it's what EVERYONE should do, just that it's what works for me. Different strokes."
28871,"That makes sense for your lifestyle. I run tours by foot through the city I live in, if I don't eat at least something small every few hours it makes my job hard as I feel weak and can't focus on what I am saying, big problem when you have 30 strangers listening to you. If I'm at home a glass of milk can sometimes do the job between meals, but it's been annoying convincing people that I am not just greedy but it'll make me light-headed, shaky and grumpy (I'm not overweight, people still start by asking why I need to eat when we ate a few hours ago)."
28872,"Oh absolutely. For you, kinda grazing throughout the day is probably best to keep your energy up. There are some days I'll do that, too, when I'm running around with my daughter because that's how toddlers like to eat haha... little snacks all day long. My younger brother has always eaten that way, too.
 
Eating patterns can be pretty flexible. If I've got a lot of work to do on a given day, I usually just won't eat until dinner. If I'm doing some running around (usually on weekends), I'll get some lunch with my daughter or a few snacks here and there."
28873,"If the meal experience isn't important to you and you just want balanced, quick, cheap calories I suggest soylent powder. I don't use it everyday but when I'm super busy it is a life saver."
28874,"And as an added bonus, you get to pretend you’re not eating people!"
28875,"I eat chopped vegetables and fruit for breakfast.  Seriously.  I cut or peel celery, carrots, apples, oranges, pears, bell peppers, etc, on the weekend, and package them in Tupperware by flavor profile.  Tupperware sits on my passenger seat during my hour commute, and I eat.  Sometimes I supplement with a hard boiled eat and string cheese.  Simple, fast, healthy.

Note:  precut bell pepper, and orange wedges, only last 2-3 days in Tupperware, so plan accordingly."
28876,"Bircher muesli in a mason jar.
Make it the night before."
28877,"You've gotta remember that any food can be a breakfast food. 

Some sort of brekkie burrito sounds doable here though. Or maybe prep a hearty smoothie"
28878,"3 eggs, two slices of toast, half an avocado, 2 slices of cheese, some tomatoes, and cucumber slices. ~€1,50. Alternatively, if I have to get quite early, then it is peanut butter, and banana on toast ~€0,30:)"
28879,"I started making oatmeal on Sundays and putting individual portions in 1-pint jars. I cook steel-cut oats for about 3 minutes and then mix them with whatever I have on hand - vanilla extract, chia seeds, walnuts, honey, almond/peanut butter etc. Top each one with fruits like apple, pineapple, banana, etc. Every morning I just put the jar in the microwave for about a minute and maybe add some maple syrup. It's quick and delicious."
28880,"Edit: Guess I should've read the post more before I replied. Hard-boiled eggs are easy to make, cheap, and can be eaten easily while driving. Even a Thomas's English muffin is easy to eat while driving. The store I go to always has BOGO deals and I keep them frozen to make them last longer. I don't eat while driving so I always have a serving of frozen veggies but you could eat fruit like an apple or banana easy while driving. Other than boiling the eggs once a week, and then taking the shell off, there's very little prep involved. If you're looking for something that you can add in to 'spice' it up some, you could get the precooked sausage links and microwave them real quick before you leave if get the precooked bacon which I'm not sure about you but I love cold bacon almost as much as hot bacon."
28881,"Breakfast burritos. Just scramble and cook a dozen eggs and portion it out into tortillas. If you want you can dice some green pepper up and add that. And if you want neat a small amount of sausage is easy. Tasty, simple, and easy to eat on the go."
28882,"The chobani greek yogurt cups are pretty easy except when the cat won't get out of my face when i eat one sitting down, but also you can buy bulk cereal from one of those dispenser things in your local supermarket that is pretty good."
28883,"Put butter in skillet.  Melt butter.  Keep adding butter here and there throughout the cooking process.  Put in baked potatoes with the skin off that you've cooked in micro or oven (micro cooked tastes better for this).  Use fork and kinda cube up the potatoes to your liking. Fry up potatoes.  When you start seeing your potatoes turning golden brown, add eggs and whatever seasoning you prefer (applewood is delicious!)  When eggs are fully cooked and potatoes are golden brown then it's ready to eat.  I call this egg and potato.  You can also add bacon if you like it, or substitute hash browns for the baked potatoes.

I also make a version like this without the egg and just add cubed chicken.  I call it chicken and potato."
28884,Have you thought about trying beef instead of chicken? Not sure what you'd call it though.
28885,"I guess beef could be substituted.  I haven't tried it, my family loves chicken a lot.  You could call it Beef and Potatoes. 😊❤"
28886,"Eggs. Best value of any food imo.

2-3 Eggs, toast, and an apple is legit $1 to $1.5 and has ~25g protein and carbs for energy with next to no fat to slow you down."
28887,"I get these Kirkland nut bars from Costco. Pretty good in terms of fiber and protein vs sugar, also no preparation, no clean-up, and portable."
28888,Honestly oatmeal. The big container can be had for $2-4 depending on brand and it will last a long time (a month?) even having it everyday.
28889,"If you can find spelt bread (i.e. Ezekiel brand in freezer section), this is a healthy breakfast option and very filling for me. I toast it then add some peanut or almond butter and half a banana sliced. Smashed avocado with hard boiled egg is a great option as well."
28890,Scrambled eggs + cheese + whatever else sounds good + corn tortilla.
28891,"Echoing what others have said... You could make oatmeal.  If you don't have 5 minutes to spare, then try instant oatmeal or make it in bulk.

You could make a large batch of beans and bacon, and microwave it while you make some toast.


Protein shakes are quicka and easy, and you can drink them on the go.

I'm not trying to be negative, but 50 hours a week isn't so much that you wouldn't have 5 minutes to make breakfast in the morning."
28892,"Meal prep. 

I suggest a breakfast burrito. 
I do a tortilla, egg whites, low fat cheese, salsa, and spinach one. Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something. 
Cook and prepare, put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave. 

I also suggest oatmeal. Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to. Pour hot water in it, go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it's done. Sometimes I add a little peanut butter. 

If you have more time than that on your hands you can't go wrong with eggs. Scrambled eggs, add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor. 5 minutes."
28893,"Mason jar time:

parfait containing oats, chia, fruit and a nut butter."
28894,"A Banana. Seriously. An Orange. An apple. It doesn't take much. 

My fav is bacon, eggs, English muffin and a fruit. But during the week, I try to do a fruit and a cup of cottage cheese. That's all. Keeps me good til noon, and I'm a tub - 270 pounds of massive, manly, testosterone oozing man. 

Seriously, I think we over think breakfast."
28895,Avocado toast. You can throw a fried egg on top if you want too
28896,"Depending on where you live, Avocados are not cheap."
28897,Can't buy a house then
28898,"Eggs if you have the time.

Portable breakfast: 2 bananas and a yougurt single cup"
28899,Oatmeal mixed with protein powder.
28900,"I've just been eating toast with butter and sugar-free jelly for breakfast. If I have the energy I'll make some eggs in the microwave using this microwave egg cooker I got from the store, or if I'm craving salt I'll microwave breakfast sausage.

This is the fastest meal I could come up with, inspired by a hotel breakfast I got in Florida. Each item takes a minute or two to prepare. It's also pretty affordable and makes few dishes. You do need a toaster and microwave though."
28901,"Smoothies. Get some frozen fruit and veggies, throw in with milk, make a big batch and use over the course of your week."
28902,Poach an egg in your oatmeal.  Put some Franks Red Hot on top.  Yum.
28903,"What kind of oatmeal? Just a plain one? 
I'm curious about this."
28904,"Plain oatmeal.  I use quick oats.  Mix the oats and water and a little salt.  Stir.  Break an egg on top, but don't stir.  Nuke for a minute and a half.  Check, stir around the edges.  Nuke for about 30 seconds more.  Your microwave will vary."
28905,"My preferred go to healthy and cheap breakfast is an English muffin with Canadian bacon or turkey bacon, egg whites, choice of cheese and spinach. I meal prep them and either eat them in the car on the way to work or at my desk. Also I eat some almonds afterwards because it leaves you feeling full."
28906,"Oatmeal is in a class of its own in terms of healthy, inexpensive, fast, and easy. 

If i wanted to be extreme about minimizing prep time/eating in the car, I would leave all the oatmeal ingredients in my car.

The per serving containers, oatmeal packets or a large container of instant oatmeal + raisins, nuts, whatever you like. Plus 5 tupperware containers and spoons. Leave it all in the car in a lunchbox or something. 

Then use an electric kettle and a thermos. 

First thing in the morning press the start button on the kettle. Takes 2-3 minutes to boil. Then get ready for work. On the way out the door  pour the hot water in the thermos. In the car, pour hot water into a tupperware with the oatmeal and let it steep while you're driving. 

Voila. Super healthy breakfast, minimum time commitment."
28907,"I mix sauteed onion, green pepper, and garlic with tricolor beans and veggies, which have been steamed together until tender:

* 375 g shredded collard greens

* 500 g chopped Swiss chard

* 4 cups spinach

* Season to taste


Usually yields 14 cups, which is gets me through 2 weeks. Every morning I'll pop a portion into the microwave while I make eggs and sauteed mushrooms to go on top."
28908,"I've been making banana oat pancakes lately, they only take about 5-10 minutes.  All you really need is a banana, 1/3C of oats and an egg, but I like to add pecans or walnuts, some cinnamon, pinch of salt, baking powder for a little leavening, and some vanilla extract.  Only takes a minute longer, but you can add or pare down to your taste and convenience.  Just blend up the oats to a powder, add banana, egg, whatever else you want, blend to a batter consistency and fry up like any other pancake.

It's best if you let the batter rest for five minutes, I use that time to make tea and empty the drain rack, but it's not a big deal if you cook them right away if you have no time.  If you preheat your pan while you're making batter, you can have a hot, balanced breakfast in 5 minutes."
28909,"Scramble a bunch of eggs and cook them in a muffin tin with liners, when they are done bag them and tag them, (ziplock, label, fridge), you can add cheese, meat(cooked), or veggies to your eggies before cooking if you like."
28910,"Egg cups. I make a dozen at a time (2 per serving). Mix up 12 eggs and throw in spices (a little seasoning salt, Italian Seasoning, onion powder for me). Spray a muffin tin. Put in spinach or whatever veggies you have on hand. Pour in the egg mixture on top. Sprinkle with cheese (I use feta). Cook @ 350 for 25 minutes. Keep in the fridge and microwave before you hit the road each day. Enjoy!"
28911,It's not hard to learn to make a good tofu scramble. Such an energy burst and goes well on a breakfast sandwich or burrito.
28912,"I make a protein shake with a banana, a handful of frozen blueberries, milk and the powder and it keeps me full until lunch time! Protein powder isn’t super cheap but it’s not awful. Worth it for the convenience factor."
28913,I go with instant oatmeal with some peanut butter and a coffee.  Maybe have an apple or a banana amount with it too
28914,"Make ahead frozen burritos! 

Just buy tortillas, eggs, and whatever else you want to add in there. I like spinach, cheese, and peppers. Cook the eggs and sauté peppers and roll it up on a tortilla. Wrap them up and freeze them. Reheat in the morning for about 1:30 in the microwave."
28915,Oh thanks for sharing!
28916,Shoot the freezing part ... I didn't think of that
28917,"Let the mix cool before you make them so the steam does not result in ice, turning it into a water-dripping burrito when you reheat it."
28918,Definitely
28919,"Yes! Forgot to say that. The first time I made them, they became so soggy when I reheated lol"
28920,"Veggie pancakes/fritters.

https://www.veganosity.com/vegan-oil-free-zucchini-carrot-fritters/

Last time I made them, I left out the onions and sage, added in half a pound of cooked ground turkey and frozen corn, meant to add in cheese but forgot, used 2 real eggs instead of flax eggs, added in a half cup of yogurt, and accidently bought limes at the store instead of lemons--and maybe all of that is why my fritters weren't at all crispy (but oh well, they're still good). 

One batch fit on a cookie pan, so if you've got multiple cookie pans, it would be worth it to make more batches at once! Then just freeze them and pop one or two in the microwave on your way out the door.

If you have a juicer, you could also juice the veggies, drink the juice, and use the pulp--that's basically what the process in the recipe about to anyway."
28921,"So I tried the technique of juicing and using the pulp for the first time, and it was super successful! I also juiced some apple and cucumber separately and made a batch of fritters with those--they're basically cookies minus sugar, and are also awesome."
28922,"I eat yogurt/cottage cheese with fresh fruit (blueberries, strawberries, bananas) topped with granola and honey almost everyday at work. You can also add some cinnamon for some extra flavor."
28923,"My bf has been making amazing bacon-wrapped egg muffins for breakfast each week. Set oven to 375 degrees. Wrap bacon around the edge of each muffin cup. Crack an egg in the middle and whisk. Top it off with cheddar, chives and/or bacon bits if you wish. Then pop in the oven for 25 minutes. If you make them on Sunday, it's enough for the rest of the work week. Easy, delicious and healthy!"
28924,I want to try that recipe in the morning! Question. I’m a new cook so bear with me. Does he cook the bacon first before he wraps it around the edge of the muffin cup? And how many egg muffins does he cook? Just trying to figure out how many servings the recipe is.
28925,"No he doesn't cook it first. It cooks in the oven, along with the eggs. Our pan only has six spaces, but the recipe could easily increase to make more servings if you have a larger muffin pan :)"
28926,"Fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, bake eggs in muffin tins and store in the refrigerator, etc. But if you are not much of a meal prep person or don't like to cook I would recommend healthy oat bars from the grocery store. I keep them in my purse in case I'm ever running late or forget breakfast. I enjoy the Belvita brand and they have many flavor and texture options."
28927,"Someone may have already said this, but overnight oats!
I bought a bunch of mason jars and I put in some oats, some yogurts/milk and some fruit in them, then just grab on my way out of the house."
28928,"If you like up and go's you gotta make smoothies.

I use:

- skim milk
- scoop of protein powder (usually strawberry or banana)
- a few slices of frozen banana (peel and slice them before you freeze)
- sometimes other frozen berries

If you have a bullet style blender these take 20 seconds to make and are better than any up and go. The frozen banana is almost like ice cream and turns it into an awesome thickshake

If you want to make it more like an Up and Go try adding a spoon of crushed oats too."
28929,"Instant oatmeal with a spoonful of peanut butter, hot water. A little more hearty than just the oatmeal"
28930,"Nothing.  It is very easy to prepare.  It costs exactly nothing.  And it gives your cells time to engage autophagy, and regular autophagy will heal all kinds of problems.  It is the very simplest and easiest form of [intermittent fasting](/r/intermittentfasting)."
28931,I just do some oatmeal with some sweatener and cinnamon .  50 hours isn't too bad unless you are underselling so you should have time
28932,Soylent
28933,"Do you have a slow cooker or a rice maker? I make steel-cut oats in my rice cooker, and portion out servings with peanut butter and/or fruit into jars to take with me on the go. I don't mind eating it cold, but it's also really good to microwave and then add a bit of  (almond) milk and brown sugar. 

My partner and I pre-make a ton of breakfast burritos to put in the freezer. Tortillas, cooked rice or roasted potatoes, black beans, spinach or arugula, scrambled eggs, salsa/hot sauce, sour cream. We make a little assembly line and put together a couple dozen. We wrap individually in plastic wrap, then store 6 each into freezer ziplock bags. If we need a quick and hearty breakfast on the go, we'll just throw one into the microwave while we're getting ready in the morning and grab it on our way out the door. These are so good, were both guilty of eating them while we're at home and not in a rush :)

Edit: oh man, I just saw that you don't like oatmeal. In that case, I'd just say anything that you can freeze is your friend. Whenever I make waffles, ill lake a double batch and freeze the extras. Pop them in the toaster, spread with nut butter and bananas, and there's another quick and easy breakfast. 

Our next experiment is to make breakfast sandwiches (English muffins, eggs, deli meat, cheese) and freeze. I've done it before and didn't love how it warmed up in the microwave, but it might be good after reheating in the oven or toaster oven."
28934,"I make an egg quiche and it lasts all week. No crust just eggs and veggies and some sort of cheese like feta or goat or whatever really
- glass pie baking plate
- add whatever veggies you have , spinach, kale, sautéed onions, mushrooms, tomato, bell peppers (you can use all or none) 
Add those to the baking plate
- mix 4 eggs pour it over the veggies
- grab cheese and throw it in too
- bake 350 for 45 min
It's fairly easy and you can cut a slice out for breakfast every day 
- if you make it thin you can prob eat it in the car. Last week I literally just had 3 eggs worth and kale so it ended like a thin crust pizza. Usually it's thicker so that might be a sloppy mess"
28935,"This is super simple and cheap and has worked well for me:

I boil about 20 eggs at a time and bring one to work each day for breakfast. Importantly, I noticed that *when* I eat the egg makes a difference. If I eat it at 8, it seems to kick start my metabolism and I'm hungrier by lunch. If I wait a couple hours and eat at 10, it holds me over perfectly until lunch."
28936,Bagel or yogurt is my go-to breakfast! Not a big morning eater but it definitely helps tide me over.
28937,"Blocks of cheese. Papperjack, cheddar, or Swiss or Colby"
28938,"If you don't mind meal prep, breakfast burritos have saved my life.  I prep a dozen on one weekend, freeze, then eat one a day for two weeks. I use eggs, potato, salsa and cheese... 

My tips: cook the salsa with the eggs (I use 12), let cool COMPLETELY! I chop my potatoes, sprinkle with season salt, bake until kind of crispy,  let cool COMPLETELY! Put egg mixture, potatoes, and cheese on a tortilla, freeze, and I'm two minutes from breakfast for two weeks. And I can/do eat in car, unlike oatmeal or casseroles for me. Wrap in a paper towel, nuke for two minutes, remember to grab from micro on way out (hardest part for me), and have a filling, convenient, not awful for you, cheap breakfast. 

I get the ingredients at Sam's... I think it's about $5/batch. ($1.40 for eggs, $1.50 for tortillas, $1.30 for cheese, some trivial cost for salsa). You have to spend more for up front costs, though, since you can only get two dozen tortillas, three dozen eggs, a bag of cheese the size of Manhattan, etc, so you'll spend like $20 to get the starter set."
28939,"Actually was coming here to post a similar question, but it wasn't exactly answered in here. 
Are there any decently healthy breakfast cereals? It seems like everything has the second ingredient as sugar, and even the brands that pretend to be healthy have almost as must sugar as fruit loops"
28940,"You might try pulling a /r/mealprepsunday and making a bunch of breakfast burritos to freeze and microwave later.

And you can choose what goes into them."
28941,"I do a breakfast smoothie when I have to stay full for a long time AND it on the go.
Just drop about 2 tablespoons of steel cut oats,a teaspoon of (low sugar and natural)peanut butter,half a teaspoon of linseeds, 2 tablespoons of soy or natural yoghurt plus a handful of frozen berries + a splash of water into a blender and go at it."
28942,"Breakfast burritos.

I cook up a bunch of egg/sausage mix on Sunday and either wrap em up right then, or just store it in the fridge and do 1 or 2 quick wraps each morning. Usually add a dollop of salsa too.

I haven't eaten cereal in the morning since school, but sometimes if I'm up early I'll eat a quick bowl."
28943,"eggs, toast, oatmeal, pancakes, any breakfast food."
28944,"Peanut butter banana sandwiches. 
Oatmeal. 
Sometimes i go with a banana and a granola bar. 
Cereal ain't that expensive."
28945,"If up-n-go works for too, couple of weetbix, a banana and a decent slug of low fat milk in a blender, quick whizz then put the whole lot in a keep cup  (or similar) and you're done.

3/4 fill the blender with water and run for 10 seconds to rinse. Empty it and clean it up when you get home."
28946,"Overnight oats. If you use steel cut oats, they aren't as soggy as rolled oats and still retain the textured chewiness.

Basic idea of most recipes:
1/4 cup steel cut oats
1/2 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon chia seeds
Put in your container in the fridge for 12 hours

In the morning, top with whatever. Banana, cocoa powder, and natural peanut butter are delicious. Stir and eat.

So much variety. Can eat them hot or cold. No added sugar and healthy for you."
28947,"At Walmart you can get a set of 50 eggs (large) for cheap
My best suggestion is to look at r/mealprepsunday and look at what people have made for breakfast and some people show recepies and shopping list, if not you can always pm them."
28949,"Whatever you do make sure to add a blender ball or something to the vessel you store it in, this sort of smoothie will separate in a very unappetizing fashion if you wait longer than an hour to drink it."
28950,Bulletproof coffee
28951,None of these sound tasty lol I really don’t like oatmeal but I can do eggs
28952,"Little late to the party it seems.

Biscuits and Gravy is a **must** in my family, it's easy and cliché but everyone loves it."
28953,"How do *you* make the gravy? Hell, how do you make the biscuits!"
28954,"Gravy:
Brown 2 lbs of pork gravy, I like one hot,  one regular, GF likes one regular, one maple, that part it up to you. If you have some bacon grease in your fridge add some to the meat while browning. I don't know that it does anything..... but.... bacon. Drain the meat and set aside. In a fairly large pot combine milk and flour until you have a good ratio of gravy to sausage, (sorry I don't have any exact measurements, I always just eyeball it). Slowly bring to a boil! This part is crucial, you don't want to scorch the milk, however if you don't boil it it will taste ""floury"". Once it comes to a boil reduce heat and add the meat. Add salt and pepper to taste. My secret ingredient is a heavy spoonful or two of smoked paprika, that stuff is made by the gods I swear. 

Biscuits:
You can make homemade ones if you want, I've used Bisquick before. It's just too much of a hassle for me. I use Pillsbury homestyle or southern style cause fuck flakey biscuits. 

And that's that."
28955,"Have you had Pillsbury frozen biscuits? If not, you should."
28956,"I was just recently introduced to them a week or two ago. Also somewhere my mom found premade, fresh biscuits at a place called cash and carry (don't know if they are national).

Definitely a good option. Especially if you have a lot of people."
28957,"Don't have a cash & carry near me, good to know though"
28958,"I've been told they are available at Costco as well. I'd imagine any bulk food store, Sam's Club, Costco, hell even Walmart might have them."
28959,"Sounds great! I make the gravy the way I was taught (southerner here), but your technique looks sound...will have to try :) thanks! 

Oh and sometimes I add in green chile to cook with the sausage for a southwestern flair ;)"
28960,"He really likes biscuits and gravy, but I'm not great at baking. Do you have a recipe you would recommend?"
28961,http://www.chow.com/recipes/30499-buttermilk-biscuits-sausage-cream-gravy
28962,"I just gave u/wmurray003 my recipe in the comments. 

It's really easy, especially if you go the Pillsbury route instead of homemade biscuits. I've had both and not noticed a difference. It's all in the gravy."
28963,"Biscuits and gravy! Make drop biscuits (so easy), brown breakfast sausage (I use Jimmie dean), salt and pepper sausage, when the sausage is fully cooked sprinkle with flour until all the grease is soaked up and sausage looks clumpy, pour milk over sausage until it floats, stir constantly over med-low heat until mixture thickens to gravy...salt and pepper to taste, spoon over biscuits, enjoy!"
28964,I have a slightly different method (see below). I'm am interested in trying your method though. Looks like I know what I'm cooking this weekend.
28965,"[Shakshuka](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/04/shakshuka/) rocks. It's eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce.

Gruel is yummy. You add several handfuls of oatmeal to last night's stew, and end up with thick, hearty, deliciousness.

On the lighter side, miso made with broth and thickened with egg is quite nice."
28966,"Ok so I know generally what gruel is from books. It's a type of porridge, but I've never tasted it. Is it like cream of wheat? Like Chinese rice porridge or like watery oatmeal?

Shakshuka looks awesome. It's bookmarked!

Edit: I'm a moron and read that wrong. Gruel is oatmeal mixed with leftover stew. We don't live together so I basically have to start from scratch, but I might try that at my place. I love making stew in the fall."
28967,"> I love making stew in the fall. 

Yup, me too. If you're not starting with a fairly spicy stew, you'll probably need to adjust the seasonings a bit. Oatmeal's bland."
28968,"What's great about Shashuka is how easy it is to make and also how easy it is to change stuff around too. I always make sure to add cheese to mine and occasionally meats too. Also, you have to be sure to have lots of flatbread when eating it."
28969,"Yusss, shakshuka is one of my go-to brunch dishes when I need to feed a crowd. 

Or just me. 

I pair it with some toasted bread that I grill up on a griddle with a touch of olive oil. I hate wasting food and usually recycle the leftover sauce (if there *is* any left) for an easy pasta dish for dinner that night."
28970,"SoCal style eggs benedict. Instead of Canadian bacon use a crab cake (lightly fried is the key) and add avocado, I've seen it with tomato added as well but I can do without. Pile on the hollandaise with your poached egg and your good to go. Seriously so damn good."
28971,"Still with an English muffin? 

I know what I want to make on my next cooking day."
28972,Yep. Everything's the same just switching out meat for crab and adding avocado. You really can't go wrong.
28973,Sounds good. Thanks
28974,croissant french toast. Just make normal french toast batter but dip buttery and delicious croissants in it and cook them up. So good
28975,yessssss this is my favorite. been on a hunt for the best croissant FT in San Diego
28976,As someone who also lives in San Diego I would love a heads up when you find it.
28977,"I have never seen it on a menu at a breakfast place here in SD, but to be honest I do not go out for breakfast much minus the occasional breakfast burrito"
28978,Good luck on your search and let us know if you find a good place!
28979,I do this and stuff the croissants with nutella and bananas.
28980,"I looooooove a simple french omelet, a la Jacque Pepin. It's gorgeous, silky, and delicate, and you can show off your mad cooking skills with it. I love to grate Gruyere with a microplane onto the inside of the omelet right before rolling it off the pan. Sooooooo good."
28981,"Sweet potato hash! Fry up a sweet potato along with a handful of any veggies you've got - I usually like mushrooms, peppers, a bit of onion, but anything works. Scramble an egg and throw it in, maybe some crumbled bacon, and always minced garlic. Usually season with cumin, a little cayenne pepper."
28982,"Huevos rancheros, New Mexico style. Or a [green chile breakfast burrito](http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/200257/new-mexico-green-chile-breakfast-burritos). Or carne adovada with eggs. Ingredients may be hard to get but well worth it!"
28983,"Corned beef hash, poached eggs and hollandaise."
28984,Do you have a good recipe? My husband loves corn beef hash. Thank you!
28985,"Corned beef hash lover here.

I order corned beef hash basically whenever I see it on a menu, and I've had a lot of gourmet, made in house corned beef hashes. While many of them are fantastic, my favorites are always found in greasy spoon diners that use canned corned beef."
28986,My corned beef has always comes from a can because I only have corned beef handy on St. Patricks Day. I was also raised eating the canned stuff so that's just how it's supposed to taste to me.
28987,"Pork roll, egg, and cheese on a toasted hard roll with ketchup. Make sure the egg is a little runny."
28988,You live or grew up near Philly didn't you? ;)
28989,"Buy fresh ciabatta bread, soft and nice. Slice it up in pieces just about 3 cm thick and put them in a hot frying pan with lots of olive oil. When one side is a bit brownish, throw in some more olive oil and turn the fuckers around. When also the other side is goldie brownie, put them on a plate and cut in just a little bit of mozzarella cheese if you want to. 

Then cut some garlic, tomato and basil and put them on a hot pan with lots of olive oil. Let the mix warm up but put the heat off before they start to get some color. Take a spoon and stack the tomato mix thing on top of the bread slices and you're done. Put on some pepper and enjoy it with whatever the fuck you like.

Tip: when using tomato, sprinkle just a nip of sugar on the tomato when it's cut. It takes away the bitterness and gives the taste a little more.. something.

Edit: sorry, this isn't something you live with the entire day, but I usually team this up with any Italian dish or salad/seafood. A creamy pasta with salmon and prawns is one of my favourites."
28990,That sounds really good. Any pasta/ seafood salad recommendations that avoid creamy dressing?
28991,"Salad with 
raw salmon (or cooked of course depending on the quality and if you can serve it raw), 
rucola (=rocket salad?), 
tomatoes, 
parma or prosciutto ham, 
cantaloupe melon, 
the kind of salad with a little bit of red color on the leaves.
and cheese if you like.
Use a lot of olive oil as it gives the food a fruity taste and contains lots of energy for the day. 

Tip: cut your salmon in max. 2x4cm thick bites and put them on the pan with oil and sprinkle some salt on top. Start with the ""bottom"" part down (aka. what has been on the skin of the fish and has a gray color) and turn it around when the colour turns more into pink than red. This part may look more grilled, but be careful when you've turned it around. Don't let the fish get too cooked and always take a big bite of one piece to try the consistency! You should now have delicious pieces of fish that you can throw into the salad."
28992,"OooOo, that sounds really good. Thanks!"
28993,"You can't go wrong with some roasted potatoes, eggs over easy, mushrooms, some good plum or vine tomatoes. I can usually get away with roasting the potatoes in a cast iron skillet, taking it out before they're completely done, and add in the mushrooms and tomatoes, and let it all finish off at the same time on the stove top, while I finish up the eggs in a different skillet."
28994,Eggs Benny or Chicken & Waffles
28995,Corned beef hash with hash browns and rye toast. Heaven.
28996,"I live in Arizona, down in the low desert near Mexico.

Breakfast burritos are a *must* down here.

My favorite place in town is a little hole-in-the-wall called Stan's.  It's a convenience store with a kitchen and tables in the back.  Everyone knows about it and they serve a few hundred burritos every day.  They work their asses off.

I always get the supreme.  That has eggs, cheddar cheese, refried beans, potatoes, and chunks of bacon.  It's not broken up pieces of thin bacon, it's more like chunks of ham.  They're big and one in the morning will keep you feeling full all day long.  Cooking is pretty straightforward - the eggs are scrambled and the potatoes are fried in a skillet.

What you could do is make up the basic ingredients and knock off five or six burritos on a Sunday, then refrigerate or freeze them so you only have to cook once a week."
28997,"New mexican here...2nd this suggestion...we make breakfast burritos for Saturday/sunday brunch....shred potatoes with mandolin, fry in thin layer of oil, scramble eggs, bake thick-cut bacon, flour tortillas, cheese, green chile, layer and fold! Even the pickiest member of my family eats these!"
28998,Eggs been a dick!
28999,Eggs can be so rude like that
29000,"So hearty is a good thing. Try this out.

1 onion of choice
1 can of hominy
1 package of bacon or a log of sausage

Brown meat, then throw in coarsely chopped onion. Salt and pepper to taste. Drain hominy, then add to Tue mix. Let hominy brown slightly. Spend the next couple hours completely stuffed. :)"
29001,"Big fan of hash using whatever was left ever from the night before.

Also, whenever I get the motivation to make pulled pork for dinner, it goes great on pancakes the next day..."
29002,"Breakfast poutine.

French fries, gravy, cheese curds, an over-easy egg, and some Canadian bacon."
29003,"I don't like eggs, so I have hash browns, bacon, and sliced avocado with sprinkled with salt, pepper, and hot sauce (Pepper Plant duh)."
29004,"Breakfast tacos, a tamale, a lime, salsa, black and kidney beans, black tea, shot of whiskey"
29005,"Home fries; cheesey, buttery grits; sunny-side-up eggs with huge, goopy yolks; and white toast with strawberry jam. Orange juice and a coffee to drink."
29006,"I seem to order Joe's Special/Scramble at every breakfast/brunch spot I go to so it's probably my favorite breakfast item. It has eggs (egg whites for me), spinach, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, basil and oregano in it. It goes great with crispy hashbrowns and and an English muffin with strawberry jam. Oh yeah, and a mimosa! Chef John has a great [recipe](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2014/04/joes-special-true-original.html) for Joe's Special."
29007,Smoked poached haddock with a poached egg.  I can't eat a single thing again until evening and it's so delicious (and healthy).
29008,"I don't have use of a smoker, would just poached still be good or is smoked key?"
29009,"You can usually buy it smoked. But yeh, it's fine unsmoked. Still really delicious."
29010,"I use Google calendar.  I like having multiple calendars so I can make them different colors and share them with different people (my husband, my son, etc.).  I have about a dozen calendars."
29011,"I second google calendar, and have a similar use case as emtaylor. My boyfriend and I each have our own calendars and we put all our stuff on there and have each other's calendars shared so its super easy. Also nowadays it'll auto add things like Dr.'s appointments and we can build in reminders and what not with all our smart devices, it's a great ecosystem."
29012,I have to agree with the Google Calendar folks.  Easy to use and  versatile
29013,Google Calendar by far
29014,Google calendar.
29015,"I personally recommend [any.do](https://www.any.do/). Even though it is primarily a to do app, it has really good calendar features and is able to sync your tasks accross many different devices. It has a premium version but its free version is pretty complete already."
29016,I just use the stock iOS calendar app. What can google calendar do that this can’t do? I’m wondering if it’s worth the change
29017,"It’s worth it! I made the switch months ago & won’t ever go back. You can make different calendars and share them with different people. You can color code them. Instead of just showing a dot where there’s an event like the iOS calendar, it says the name. It’s easy to add things to google calendar from your email. I also like that it has reminders & tasks."
29124,Google Calendar
29019,Fantastical 2 with a google calendar set up
29020,Fantastical if you are in the Apple ecosystem
29021,They all have the same features pretty much. I use Google calendar
29022,"Depends what you care about!

I need all-day events at the top of the widget, and iCloud calendar is the only program that works how I want."
29023,I like Informant as it’s calendar as well as todo list in one package.
29024,"I dunno if this helps but I searched for ages so that I could schedule things, and schedule tasks.

So I can schedule a dentist appointment 12-1pm Wednesday but that day I want in non time slots ""Chemistry chaper 1.2"" ""Post tax letter"" ""phone for doctor appointment"", and that these stick out until ""ticked"".

You have this on google calendar you have a list at the side. However this functionality is a bit cooky on the app and there isn't really a way to fill in the gap. So if this specific thing appeals to you and you will only look on desktop then google calendar as it's free.

If you want this in an app ticktick is the only one that does this. It's more of a ""productivity/task"" app but it functions a lot better than most of the non-google calendars, and obviously better in this one aspect. It is a paid thing tho."
29025,"i was using google calendar on android.
but lately started paying for ticktick's premium plan and their calendar option is really nice and the app is very customizable"
29026,Time tree for sure
29027,"I use Business calendar app, I am pleased with the free version and I have it as a widget on my Android phone. It keeps me organized."
29028,"Pocket Informant

Unfortunately you can only get version 5 now.

I refuse to go onto V5, as V4 is absolutely perfect IMHO."
29029,"1.	Google Calendar is the baseline if my calendar because it works with my email. 
2.	iCal is the app I use to synchronise my various calendars (GCal, Outlook for school email, a few subscribed Google calendars that I toggle on and off as needed, Facebook events, etc) across my phone, iPad, and laptop. 
3.	Edo Agenda displays my list of daily events and functions as my day-to-day task planner."
29030,"I’ve used a few, but google calendar is the best."
29031,The free one on your phone.
29032,Calendar
29033,"I’ve used Fantastical, Timepage and stock iOS and I still keep coming back to the stock. Having an iPad, Apple Watch and iPhone makes it much more productive to use native apps."
29034,"Fantastical just uses Calendar though, so if you use that one use can use either one on different devices."
29035,It’s a competition between calendars and fantastical is see. What are the big cons of both?
29036,Fantastical. Hands down.
29037,Been my go-to ever since it released. Amazing piece of software.
29038,"Help me understand why something as mundane as a calendar can be worth 80 or so of my dollars (between desktop and phone)? My calendar runs my life, but I can't understand what I'm missing that would be worth this extortionate price?"
29039,"If your calendar runs your life then 22 cents a day ain’t that bad. Less actually, because your upgrade cycle is usually every couple of years, so 12 cents. I have no problem paying for quality software. Fantastical has a way better UI, excellent natural language support, great x-callback-url support, a great widget, great keyboard shortcuts on the Mac. Think of it as iCal Pro (yes, I know it’s not called iCal anymore)."
29040,"Fantastical, it's almost no competition. I use both Fantastical and Things3 for Calendar/Time Management."
29041,Why is it so much better?
29043,I wish I were as organized as you tbh. I just throw whatever in my calendar. 😵
29044,start being organized and it will change your life. you become much more productive and it's satisfying as hell
29045,"The ability to manage and see your reminders in Fantastical is really handy.
Furthermore it has a great monthly view without missing the Agenda function.

But there are some downsides too. I don't like their maps integration and search and depending on how many appointments you have daily, it might feel a little bit overwhelmed.

It is for sure one of the best calendar clients but like another user mentioned, I would never pay for the desktop version because it is too expensive. After all it is a calendar app.

If you are looking for a great alternative Google calendar is really solid and it is working with iCloud calendars too."
29046,It's the little things.
29049,Calendars 5
29048,I use Googles calendar exclusively. Great app and integrates with GMail perfectly.
29050,I really like Timepage.
29051,"I gotta say that Timepage may be the one with the best design, but I just can't get around the idea of subscribing to a calendar app. Do you use Timepage constantly throughout the day? What would you say are its key features?

Edit: BTW Fantastical user here"
29052,"I've never used Fantastical, I wasn't a fan of its design. $12 for an app I use all the time I think it's worth it. I subscribe to stuff I like. Like Bear, 1Password, and Timepage. Key features? Nothing insanely notable. I really like the design. I do really like the weather notifications. Honestly. Nothing special now that I think about it. I decided to try it a few months back and I've enjoyed it so far."
29053,I really like a new one called Pod
29054,"I personally use Google because of the month view.  If the stock app or Fantastical offered that type of view, I’d use one of them instead."
29055,Pod calendar is new and awesome
29057,Dawn Calendar
29058,"I use Google Calendar for all of mine. I think the manually moving things around if your schedule/plans change is something you'd have to do in any app. And for my money, Google Calendar fits the bill. 

a) free

b) easily accessible on multitude of devices anywhere with internet

c) color-coding

d) shareable

e) view multiple calendars at once

f) instant syncs

There are probably more, but that's what I could think of quickly.

I have a main ""work"" calendar, that's where I put in who I'm booked with - I share this with my wife so she knows where I am on whatever day.

Then I have individual calendars for each client that I work with - so clientA gets their own calendar. clientB and so on - these are just for me to track what I've done or what I plan to do.

On the client calendars I put an entry in for ""projectX - rough cut"" and then estimate out how long that might take. I reassess it each day or as things move/change and adjust as necessary. It doesn't really take that long to do. 

But, you might also want to consider a project management system (something like Trello) where you can create a board with ""cards"" and tasks and then move the tasks from ""To Be Done"", ""Doing"" and ""Done"". It may be more useful to you if you're more interested in tracking the movement/completion of each task vs tracking the time devoted to each task.  


Full disclosure, I have tried incorporating Trello into my work, but I just can't keep on top of it the way I should when the project starts going."
29059,"Back in 2012, I worked at a facility that did tagging for network promos. I don't know if anyone has done that stuff before but it can be lots of variables and deliverables incorporating one spot. When you have 40 or so deliverables to many networks and platforms, I integrated Trello into our workflow and they ended up buying the pro subscription to add other people to board. It works well more on an AE or organizational level, but for anything creative - or even laying down story ideas, it doesn't really help as much as a flow chart would."
29060,There’s an enormous amount of project management tools out there that will work for you. Many are freemium. I personally use ClickUp. You can use templates to get you most of the way set up the way you want it.
29061,"Believe me, you're entering a world of pain with this question. There are so many terrible apps out there it's hard to find one you really like. I personally use google calendar + google tasks because to me it's the best calendar + to do list combination. 

I've used Asana and it's quite good, it really gives you a lot of functions that are great for a professional workflow. You can do things project-based, there's a calendar and it's especially useful if you work in a team. It's dirt cheap too, something like ten bucks a month (per team member as far as I remember)"
29062,You might like Asana. It's free if you are just using it for yourself. www.asana.com
29063,"I use Asana (and trello to an extent) on the big picture of a project but for me, there is nothing better than post it notes on the wall. 

I also have been known to use the Emergent Task Planner (also analog) over at https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/ to help the day to day tasks.

Is this method electronic, no. Have I played with various project management pieces, yes, but to no avail.

Note: I think if I were in a team, I would gravitate 
 to an online platform. The last 48h film project we did, the Google suite of online tools was of key importance for a remote editor like myself."
29064,"TickTick has calendar with possibility to arrange tasks, hide completed tasks, hide future repeat cycles and hide subtasks. You can also filter the view, so you can create custom list (filter) called ""Only today tasks"" set the logic ""Show today tasks"" and in your calendar click on ""View"" - ""Only today tasks"" list.  It will be still ""weekly view"" but only ""today"" tasks will be showing, so it's a nice workaround.

Edo Agenda has feature called Journal that consists of left panel -simple calendar, central panel - journal and right panel - to do. I am not sure of the dragging feature tho.

This is all I can think of."
29065,"Thanks for reminding me of ticktick, I have used it in the past, but I forgot that it had a calendar too. I will try it again and see if it works."
29066,"Try GoogleCalendar! You can set up events to repeat on a schedule, as well as employ daily, weekly, and monthly views for all your events.

For the to-do list, I’d suggest Wunderlist. It is awesome!"
29067,"I have already tried Google Galendar, but I don't want to schedule, because my tasks don't come on regular basis. I just want to save time inputing tasks because 99% are recurring."
29068,"Oh, okay. I’m not really sure what app would allow for that, but if you find out, make sure to share!"
29069,I don’t think is going to hit the mark exactly for what you want but I really like timepage and actions by moleskine. The apps are really nice looking and I really like the repeating tasks option for actions and how the info for each shows up in the other apps.
29070,Amazing Marvin will be able to do this with the new calendar feature that is on the roadmap. Should be ready in 4-8 weeks.
29071,"Try [Lanes](https://lanes.io). It has a calendar view but you can drill down to weekly or daily view too

> Drag and drop tasks from a todo list, especially recurrent ones

Yep, possible.

Although it doesn't go deeper than daily, so may not fit your requirement for 5 or 10 minute slots."
29072,Business calendar 2.  You might need 30 to 60 minutes to go through all the different options to make it look  exactly how you want it.
29073,"Since you're already invested in the Google ecosystem, why not use Google Calendar? You should be able to share your MS calendar to your Google calendar."
29074,For sure an option. Just seeing if there something out there I wasn't aware of that would keep all the calendars in their own world's and pull everything into one place.
29075,"There are services such as CalendarBridge that will allow you to sync your Google and Microsoft calendars if that's useful for you?

  


https://calendarbridge.com/"
29076,Agree Business Calendar 2 is very good.  Also Digi cal is a good option.
29077,"a I'll add a third rec for Business Calendar 2.  It works well, has lots of options, , and is still updated regularly."
29078,"I been trying to find a calendar that will work across Linux and Android so i can get an alert on each to take the garbage out to the road the night before garbage day at least a few different times spaced out an hour or so apart in case i dismiss it the first couple of times because i am busy. Our garbage man picks up the garbage very early in the morning when it is still dark and i am still sleeping.

When my grandpa was alive he would remind me a few times before i went out  to take the garbage to the road sometime late at night. Now of days i literally forget every other week and miss the garbage man.

My grandpa would say take the garbage out, Then i would say I am doing something right now in a little bit. After a few more times then i got the garbage to the road and the rest of the inside garbage too. After the 3rd or 4th time he reminded me."
29079,"Hmm, maybe look into Home Assistant. Sure you could setup a device to ask you if you took the trash. If no response then trigger alarm to go off and ask you again."
29080,"I really don't want to invite a way for bad actors and bad hackers including government hackers into my home to spy on me in my home.

Pervert pedophiles already found a way to hack into smart tv's that have webcams and microphones that parents put in there children's bedrooms or there own bedrooms and living rooms. When the TV got hacked into the person started talking to the child or he could of kept silent for a long time watching before he started talking to her. You can cover up a camera but not a microphone or speaker. A microphone is just a speaker as you can use a small speaker as a microphone. That is what my uncle used to talk on voice chat with back in the late 90's early 2000s when he didn't have a regular microphone.

That is a big enough red flag not to have anything like that in a bedroom or even in any room of the house including all those assistance devices like Alexa and google home.

Anything that happens in those rooms or earshot of those rooms they can listen to and or watch if in range of the camera or microphone. The same thing happens with those so called smart security devices people use. Thieves were watching those people through their security devices. Are you naked at all in front of your TV or device? Well someone may be watching you through the camera and listening. Are you having sex with your girlfriend or wife? Well someone may be watching that too. People don't realize how unsafe these devices really are and that is the price people pay because they want convenience and luxury.

There is nothing secure that is a digital electronic device that connects to the internet. At least not forever. Eventually someone finds an exploit or cracks your password even if you didn't use the default password and settings. They may not brute force your password if you use a strong password but as soon as one person finds an exploit they are in and thousands among thousands of hackers including paid government employees like the NSA, FBI and other law enforcement, including other governments from other countries like North Korea, Iran, Russia and China to list a small few that are enemies or frenemies of our nation and are constantly looking for exploits."
29081,"I really like aCalendar which has lots of great calendar views and a sleek reminder. Also, it's done by a small German company which I find worth supporting. Works great with Google Calendar or other calendars by just hooking up with the Android calendar.

I use Outlook and the Outlook App to sync the calendar but find it too simple."
29082,Just get dawn and you’ll be set
29083,iOS + Things 3
29084,"After trying a lot of calendar apps (Dawn, Timepage, Outlook, iOS default app), still I come back to fantastical. It's the best for me because this provides very nice looking, synthetic view on both my pro and personal schedules. 

Additionally to this, the event input feature is very convenient to use as this supports the natural language.

Last but not least, fantastical's editor just releases a bunch of widgets that are, too, nice looking and effective."
29085,"I use [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), but now that it has become a subscription app, I would probably choose [Calendars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendars-planner-reminders/id608834326) instead since it's still a low one time payment (for now).

For the default calendar app, you probably see the month calendar on top with a list of that day's events underneath. The top menu should show < Oct 2020 with the icon next to it selected (rectangle with lines under it). If that's what it looks like for you, all you need to do is tap ""Today"" at the bottom left of the screen. You should now see a scrollable list view.  If you didn't already have today's date selected, you'll have to tap Today once to go to today, then tap it again for the list. It's only 1 tap if you were already on today.

You'll notice the top has changed from < Oct 2020 to just < October, and the icon next to it is now just lines (events) without the rectangle (calendar) above it.  Tapping the lines brings you to day view with an hourly breakdown. Tapping < October brings you back to the previous screen with the calendar month and single day's events under it."
29086,Calendars 5 by Readdle. Is the only one can properly manage google calendar notification
29087,Awesome Calendar
29088,"I also kept looking for that perfect app. (Fantastical. Timepage. Calendar 5. Stock)

Till someone said, find the one that fits most and adjust to the app.
For me month view is crucial aswell and Google calendar is the best in this imo."
29089,Are you looking for one that works with Google Calendar or standalone?
29090,Google calendar
29091,Today Calendar
29092,Why not Google Calendar then?
29094,I've tried it and it's pretty decent overall but again  it's not very esthetically pleasing :(
29095,"Try Edo Agenda! It's aesthetic and structured like a physical planner. I have tried everything, but nothing has this nice mix of note - tasks - calendar in one."
29096,"Etar:

https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ws.xsoh.etar/

pretty much just like the LineageOS calendar but has black theme"
29097,"I recommend ""aCalendar+""

Nice material design, reliable. Google calendar and Google tasks to sync with.

Dev is working on new version, now available as beta version. Already very good."
29098,"Month
It's a widget though. But sync with Google calendar perfectly"
