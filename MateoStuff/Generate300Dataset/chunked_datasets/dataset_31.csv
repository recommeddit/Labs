https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/I7jJU1y"
73500,"Whoa, thats a 10k listed at 117. I thought my Anker 10k was about 30-40g lighter than ""average"", but this Xiaomi is even 35% lighter? AND has type-c? Almost seems too good to be true :)"
73501,This battery is really good.  I use it for about a year.  You can find reviews on it: https://youtu.be/Did2ZZVT5_k
73502,"You're right, that's most likely a typo. On the 6th slide it says ""6.24oz (177g)"".
Still 14g lighter than my Anker Powercore II."
73504,Hey come on. If we could google it all the sub literally would not exist.
73506,you'll have to use the search function to find that stuff
73552,"If I remember correctly, the Iphone X uses Power Delivery (not qualcomm's quick charge or other technologies) for quick charging, so you'll want a powerbank that supports ""Power Delivery"" (PD) and a USB-C to lightning cable for the fastest charging. Of Anker's 10k banks, the below support it. I'd go with the lightest if you have no other criteria. Someone more familiar with charging tech may want to double check this.

73553,Apparently there is little difference in charging time between the PD (30 w) charging time and the other 18w charging times for the new iphones.  Sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM2Ih7xLkCo
73554,"I'm an Android user and not familiar, but I'm assuming all of those Apple chargers are PD enabled? I believe PD is less concerned with wattage (though important as shown in the vid) and more a dynamic regulation of charging. So a PD vs non-PD bank like in Anker selection could make a difference in charge time."
73555,"Is fast charging important in a camping scenario? Slow charging is more efficient so would mean a lighter powerbank for the same benefit, so long as you don't mind leaving it plugged in a bit longer. Not really an issue for me when hiking. Charging the powerbank itself might be better faster, if you're stopping off places, however."
73556,True. I figure the fast charging benefit comes from (less) time spent in towns. For the Anker 10ks at least it looks like PD vs non-PD is about 0.65oz.
73557,"I have the middle one ($23.99) and I love it. It's fast via both outputs and charges pretty fast. When I travel, I pretty much charge with that since it moves around so easily. If I even need to recharge it, it charges fast."
73558,"Anker power banks sold on Amazon are (sometimes intentionally) confusing. This site explains the differences.  
 [https://www.powerbankguide.com/anker-power-banks-things-to-know/](https://www.powerbankguide.com/anker-power-banks-things-to-know/) 

After doing my research I decided the RAVPOWER 6700 was the battery for me. You'll notice that this list of the best powerbanks doesn't even include Anker. RAVPOWER 10,000 might be good for you, but you should read through it yourself.   
[https://www.powerbankguide.com/best-10000-mah-powerbanks/](https://www.powerbankguide.com/best-10000-mah-powerbanks/)"
73559,"Thanks! I think I‚Äôll go with the RavPower as I‚Äôve found it on Amazon UK for a good deal.

I live in the UK and will be using the charger in Europe, so now trying to work our what different adapters and cables I need for my iPhone X and EU plugs."
73561,That's the power bank I use.l for my Android. I think it's ideal for regular USB phone as it has quick charge input and output. But OP has an iPhone X which uses USB-c so this won't work..
73562,"It works, but just slower compared to a power bank that supports USB PD."
73563,"It‚Äôll still work with all of his old lightening cables and any off the shelf ‚ÄúiPhone charging cord‚Äù  
I have 6 chargers, only one is the USB-C that came with my phone."
73564,"i have basically the same setup, and it works great for my use. 

used to charge pixel 4 xl, nitecore nu25 and garmin inreach mini. on very conservative power settings on all devices, with moderate to heavy use of phone and inreach, i expect to be able to go for 5-6 full days with this setup."
73566,"It depends on if I'm somewhere I'm familiar with or not. If not, I usually leave tracking on, 1 hour intervals, and shut it off when I'm in camp. With that, I expect 2 days of use, at least. Varying factors include number of texts, weather updates, and GPS usage for navigation."
73567,I like the first of 2 above. Used it on the AZT and satisfied.
73568,"The Al case ones are a bit more rugged.   A fellow hiker had her Anker burst into flames, INSIDE her backpack, due it getting dropped and cracked."
73569,Sounds like either a battery shorted or the lithium batteries had their wrap penetrated. Neither are necessarily the fault of anker
73570,I usually just check Wirecutter and tech gear lab... And Reddit üëç
73571,"This is the correct answer: [https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y9QYCDC/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y9QYCDC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

73573,What's the name of that Nintendo stitch sub?
73574,/r/NintendoSwitchDeals
73575,Cheers!! Another poster suggested that too and after having a quick look it seems perfect. I‚Äôm new to this whole quick charge thing so I‚Äôll have to check out what adapters I need for my iPhone and to charge the bank itself
73577,It doesn't list it but I and others have tested it and it does do pass thru.

73579,"Anecdote, but my Anker 10000 power bank started swelling significantly one month after the warranty ended.  They didn't replace it or anything, which is understandable given it was technically out of warranty, but that experience didn't leave me with much confidence in the brand."
73580,i dropped down to a 6000mah bank as it was half the size and does 1 full recharge to my phone.
73581,"Well I‚Äôm not an expert but from a quick (20ish minute) research before buying mine for the PCT I found a 13,000 battery bank that was advertised as the same weight and size of a 10,000. So I bought that one instead. My friend has an older 10,000 and mine is defiantly lighter but a few ounces but again, his is much older. He couldn‚Äôt  remember when he bought it. But as far as on trail, I seen a lot that looked just like mine so I put some stickers on mine (I know, not UL) but that way I could tell mine apart from others. I suggest a wall plug in with at least 2 ports"

10217,"Hi, illustrator here. 

If you're in the US: [General's Kimberly Pencils](https://www.dickblick.com/products/generals-kimberly-drawing-pencils/) are a great first time pencil for art usages. They're as cheap as .75 cents a pencil and available in all the grades of hard and soft. Some people don't like them, but the way I think about them, it was the only pencil my high school art teacher supplied for our classes....and art teachers who work in K-12 have to provide a tools they can agree with, within a budget for classes of 15-20 students a class.

[Here's a quick example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfKZgA_ndiD/) of what can be done, I bought a few when I was at the art store the other day picking up more expensive supplies (because why not...they were .79 a pencil with a student discount). 

If you're not in the US, and/or once you get a feeling for what grades of pencils you like: Staedtler Mars Lumograph or Faber-Castell 9000. I use the Mars Lumograph in basically all my illustration work that's traditional, it's a very well built pencil, and can be found most places in the world at art stores. In the US, expect to pay [1.25-2.00 a pencil](https://www.dickblick.com/products/staedtler-lumograph-drawing-and-sketching-pencils/). 

[Faber Castell 9000s](https://www.dickblick.com/products/faber-castell-9000-pencils/) are also nice, but can be a bit harder to find off the internet, and I've seen them in those stores often priced more than the Lumograph as a result. 

If you just want to do cartooning/any sort of work you want to ink and/or color, you'll probably only need 2 or 3 grades. I use 2H-HB-2B. 2H is for sketch, HB is for final lines, and when I'm doing a drawing I'm pretty sure I'm not going to ink but I still want to look dark, I'll add 2B. Maybe 4B, but at that grade I smudge like crazy.

If you want to do realistic shading with only graphite, I'd recommend buying a box set with all the grades and working from there. This is why I recommended General's, the entire set of their pencils will run you about $10. Then upgrade to a nicer pencil as you go along.

I would only buy mechanical or Blackwing AFTER you've figured out what you want to draw an an artist, as they both have somewhat unique applications in drawing. Mechanical can be good on the environment and good for sketching/drafting/fine details. I never liked shading with them though, and clutch pencils can be expensive. Blackwings are great for dark details, but not so great for anything that needs clean erasing.

Just my 2 cents. Cheers!"
10219,"I hear about that and the Blackwing all the time

How much is one"
10220,$2 - $3 a piece.
10221,Where can one buy Blackwing singles?
10222,Do i look rich to you i cant afford that
10223,"> I don't care about the price tbh i just want to be an artist

> Do i look rich to you i cant afford that"
10224,Uhhh...i can explain?
10225,Yes you can. It‚Äôs worth every penny.
10226,"Start with an ebony pencil. Be careful not to drop them as they are particularly sensitive. 

The thing about art pencils is that you have to be able to achieve dark grades without embossing the paper from pressing down too hard.

You only need a few pencils, a 1-3 H, a 2B, and a 6-10B. The 6-10Bs can hold off until later.

Plus ebonys are cheap.

Eberhard Faber ebonys are really cheap on ebay and you can buy in bulk for dollars (plus I think they have a better composition than the prismacolors."
10227,"Draw Foxy's ass when you get those pencils, it's ingrained well into that brain of yours and I think you'd nail it"
10228,Who the fuck is foxy
10070,"Mitsubishi makes the best pencils I've ever used, the Hi-Uni. They're also extremely expensive; however, the Uni 2mm leadholder refills are very affordable and extremely good quality.

For softer, sketching pencils, I like General's Layout pencils (very black). Any of the common brands like Staedtler, Faber-Castell, Derwent, General's, etc. are good quality drawing pencils overall. I like Staedtler and Tombow the best for detailed drawing, they seem extremely consistent."
10071,I prefer graphite holders to a pencil. They hold a point better and last forever. The model doesnt really matter. http://www.amazon.com/Sanford-Turquoise-Lead-Holder/dp/B00076MAUK/ref=sr_1_3?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1338076219&sr=1-3
10073,"It really depends on what you are using them for. If you are only doing design, I would say that (first of all you should be using H pencils for clean work) you don't need heavy graphite or wax based pencils. That means stay away from Mars Lumograph (the darkest of all pencils) and Faber Castell (better for doing classical drawing). 

If I were you, I would use the Monograph Pencils that come from Tokyo. They are a bit pricier, but they are by far the cleanest 4b and 6b pencils I have ever used. A good rule of thumb for buying supplies is to look for the country of manufacture. Germany, France, and Japan make the bulk of the really good stuff. Holland too I suppose."
10074,The pencils will be used for sketching anything from still life to doodling/illustrations
10075,then go with staedler's mars lumograph
10076,Staedtler Mars Lumograph.
10077,"Most people consider the Faber-Castell 9000's to be the best drawing pencils and Staedtler's Marsgraphic in second, at least of those commonly available in openstock."
10078,"Any brand name drawing pencil should be fine. Just avoid cheap pencils, since in order to make them cheap they put additives in the graphite mix that makes the graphite core brittle and waxy, making it difficult to sharpen and easy to break inside the wood. Just about any minor impact can break the core of a cheap pencil, and many are already broken inside the wood by the time you buy them."
10079,I got a pack of pencils and it included two completely graphite ones. One of those broke in two different places. It's irritating because they're new and don't seem cheap.
10080,"There are a bunch of sites out there devoted just to pencils if you take the time to look.  [PencilTalk.Org](http://www.penciltalk.org/) is one, for example.

There are lots more!  :)

http://leadheadpencils.blogspot.com/    
http://www.pencilrevolution.com/category/reviews/pencils/"
10081,"I use Derwent because its the only open stock available where I live, but I haven't really seen much difference between brands aside from ultra-cheap pencils which I've noticed tend to be harder and almost waxy or something."
10082,"Hmm I don't know about any other brand, I took an art class years ago almost everyone used Staedtler, in a drafting class in school everyone used that too. I'd suggest it just because it's the only one I've ever used religiously :D."
10083,"Definitely the Palomino Blackwing 602
yeah, I'm gonna be that guy"
10084,"That's like asking if Ford or Chevy is best. This thinking is basically ""What are the cool kids using?"" It doesn't matter. What can you afford? 


The fun part of art is finding what's best for you. If the best artist you know uses X brand, are you going to use X brand if they don't produce results you like?"
10085,"I like the Blick Studio drawing pencils. The quality is good, but what I really appreciate is that they print the hardness on ALL SIDES so it's always immediately obvious which pencil is which. I can't tell you how much time and aggravation this has saved me."
10086,"Faber-castell or Derwent. Ticonderoga pencils are nice but they really aren't for drawing.

EDIT: Forgot the Staedtler Mars Lumograph."
10088,"Came here to say Palomino! I'm an HB/2B gal, myself. 

Also, Blackwings are fantastic."
10089,I don't draw anything serious without using Ticonderoga pencils. They know what they're doing.
10090,"What I was meaning to say with the ""Ticonderoga"" statement, was I'm not good enough at traditional drawing for it to matter what pencils I use."
10091,I like Reeves sketching pencils.
10092,"It's whatever you're trying to get out of it. For me the brand doesnt matter, it's the hard/softness of it. I always seem to need an HB, 2B, 6B and I love my 9B I found. 

Also graphite sticks are awesome."
10093,I don't draw very much and was hoping to get some more information out of this thread but I have always used Staedtler and Prismacolor pencils whenever I do draw.
10094,"From the replies here and from other sites that i searched, those two seem to be the most recommended. I guess it's not really the pencil, it's mostly how you use it!"
10095,Black prismacolor on news print is great for practice. Use a better archival paper for refined work.
10096,"Like graphite pencils? I always preffered [graphite holders like this](http://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Mars-STD780C-Lead-Holder/dp/B0006HXM8O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387915115&sr=8-2&keywords=graphite+holder) though there are much cheaper ones that work fine.  They hold a point for a really long time and the graphite also lasts much longer than a pencil.  The graphite can be retracted back into the holder so that it doesnt snap while you are traveling with it like normal pencils sometimes do and one graphite holder can be used for many different types of graphite so it saves space. Not to mention I can get the pointiest sharpest ends ever after sharpening them. Like dangerously so. I have accidentally stabbed myself with mine many times. It gets really sharp, but the graphite is thick enough that the points dont snap very much.

The down side is you need a [special sharpener.] (http://www.amazon.com/Alvin-Rotary-Lead-Pointer-ANALP41/dp/B001DI8FSM/ref=pd_sim_op_3) At first you will probably snap a lot of graphite sticks, but its just getting the technique down right and it will stop being a problem. The big downside is that after you sharpen your pencil you need to empty out the sharpener immediately because they leak powdered graphite all over the place and its messy as fuck.  I had to keep a special ziplock back in my pencil holder just to keep the sharpener in and every time I fished it out I had graphite all over my hands. I ended up keeping a wad of tissue to shove into the reservoir of the graphite holder just so loose graphite wouldnt spill all over the place. I had to take the sharpener out of the back, take the tissue out of the sharpener, sharpen the pencil, empty the holder  put the tissue back in it and then put the sharpener back in the bag.  

So its not perfect for traveling, but over all better than a pencil."
10097,Lead holders are the stuff. I found [this](http://leadholder.com/assets/lh-draft/caran_dache/cd-fixpencil-77-blk.jpg) inside an old box and now I can't use anything else. The sharpener under the top button works great.
10098,"I use the same led holder, I usually just tap on the back of the sharpening part until all the graphite comes out."
10099,"I find that even after emptying it graphite that is stuck to the sides slowly leaks out into my pencil bag, making a big gray mess on everything.  Erasers work great when they are covered in a thin layer of graphite.  I just really wish they made a sharpener that didnt leak graphite. Then a graphite holder would be the perfect form of pencil for me."
10100,"The ""button"" of that Staedtler is a sharpener."
10101,"Prismacolors are standard, but very expensive, honestly I do most of my drawings digitally, and use Ticonderoga (spelling?) pencils when working in a sketchbook."
10102,"I had a drawing instructor recently say that Prismacolor has gone down in quality recently. I have had trouble sharpening them, even with a knife ‚Äî the lead keeps breaking. I think it was Derwent that I've switched to.

Problem is that Prismacolor is the most commonly available coloured pencils and seem to come in many more colours than Derwent."
10103,"Prismacolor apparently has 2 lines and one is discontinued. The way to tell the difference is the old, good line has a five digit number on it. I love those. 

The other newer has a 4 digit code, from what I hear, those are crap."
10104,Thanks for the heads-up! I'll keep an eye out for the five-digit ones.

10107,"Whichever sketchbook you get, it's best if it says 'acid free' on the cover. That has to do with the longevity of the paper. You will also want to take note of the poundage. The lower the pounds, the thinner the paper. I like 90lb. & above. (for reference, tracing paper is 25lb.) 50lb. is so thin I feel I will rip the paper.

As someone else said, Strathmore is a good brand. Might also want to pick up some newsprint. It degrades quickly but it's super cheap & is used for studies. I saw a newsprint pad that was $2 for 100 sheets. Don't buy Royal Langnickle. It's cheap but you can't erase & it is not acid free.

For pencils, well, I don't like how graphite smears. (my first few sketchbooks were a mess & I could barely see what I drew) I recommend picking up a pack of Mitsubishi colored pencils that are 1/2 red & 1/2 blue: http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Vermilion-and-Prussian-Blue-Pencil-5-5-Hexagonal-Body-Pack-of-12/pd/5161 or Prismacolor Col-erase: http://www.prismacolor.com/products/colored-pencils/col-erase .

Neither of these will smudge. You can undersketch in a light color & tighten the lines in a darker color. Both have hard pigments so you can get them to a nice point. Plus, pretty colors! You can sketch in aqua & purple or pink & red or whatever, & it's just delightful."
10108,"I'm a professional artist, specialized in human form, pencil, ink, digital color. Been drawing unrelentlessly since I was a kid. And I want to tell you. It does not matter.

you could buy a lovely canson paper sketchbook, sweet warm color, unbeatable texture, 30 pages for 10$... or, a pack of laser copy paper (legal size), that'll be about 400 pages for less than 5$. At the beginning you want quantity, not quality, yo want to churn out sheets of paper as if you were a xerox machine. And you need to deattach yourself from those early drawings, you don't want to be careful, you will make lots of mistakes and it would be a pity to waste good pencils and paper on such awful stuff. 

Trust me. I still use that kind of cheap paper, with ballpen, or whatever pencil (usually 2 or 3B), marker, charcoal, or instrument I had around. I still practice everyday and loads of those sketches end up in the recycle bin. They're trash.  Now, I have some nice sketchbooks for when I'm feeling fancy or I'm working on a theme and I want to keep track of everything, but that comes later.

there's one thing I would spend my money on. Pencils, that makes a real difference, and can change the whole feeling, if you can find them, cretacolor art pencils are the bomb, this austrian brand mixes graphite with clay and those are the softer, more enjoyable and lovely pencils I've ever used, I wouldn't go for less than B or 2B, buy loads, but ultimately try everything, everyone has a different feel.

get yourself a legal, letter, or smaller sketchbook, and use it as a reward once a week, or once every 100 sheets of legal paper, and you'll keep track of your advance, skimming tons of rubbish. You definitely want to produce tons of rubbish to get better.

Don't get too attached, be relentless with yourself and be your worst critic, making a drawing that doesn't look that bad is ok, but if you conform with that, you'll be lying to yourself and plateau in a shitty confort zone.

check quickposes.com and this website:
http://artists.pixelovely.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing/

get Betty Edwards's ""Drawing with the right side of the brain"". do EVERY exercise, religiously. I've seen the most amazing results with people I've trained and myself.

Try, please try, to find a drawing circle, with live models, naked preferably, using photos as a reference is ok, but trust me, nothing beats seeing some in 3D and translating it in 2D. it works totally different parts of your brain.

practice everyday. copy the masters, pay respect, study them, learn from them. Go to a museum. See how they solve problems. Don't worry too much about copying, you'll find your own solutions at some point, and they'll be more interesting.

the more you learn, the clearer you see what's lacking in your skill set, right now just doodle. 

have fun! if it gets frustrating, (it will) draw something different to clean the slate, go for a walk, draw something you wouldn't ever draw, draw your pencil sharpener, a hanging jacket, everything adds up.

Cheers, if you have more questions lemme know."
10109,"Basically all of this, same background and on my way up. All of my sketching paper is from dollar-store type places and I have rolls upon rolls of those M√ÖLA drawing paper rolls from Ikea because they're like $5 for 30 meters of paper and are very versatile in how you want to use them (I've used them because they have great dimensions for croquis and because I can tape sheets of them onto my walls so I can write and draw ideas down for projects.) It's a bit like starting out running or doing exercise. For the first long while you don't really need any fancy gear, all your shoes and clothes need to do is not get in your way of achieving results."
10110,"How do I make it so I can get into ""the zone"" any time I want? Last night I did it somehow and then I literally couldn't stop drawing. A lot of times drawing feels painstaking, but if I could get into the zone every day I would learn so quickly and be so productive.

Another totally unrelated question: I see some people do really small thumbnail sketches, or to sketch multiple gesture drawings to a page. But then some people tell me to draw large to learn to use my whole arm. Which is it lol?"
10111,"Some days it'll suck. Somedays you'll dig it. A good teacher told me you don't need inspiration to do work, you need to do work to get inspired. Draw small, big, medium, tiny, depending on the media and paper. A small A6 or A5 block asks for small drawings, fine pens, medium pencils, get a A2 paper and charcoal and it's gonna be impossible not to go big. 

Filling up a page with dozens of little gesture drawings is as necessary as going big in a small detail. Try drawing your other hand as big as the paper, with all the wrinkles and valleys. It's a good training"
10112,"you might need to narrow this down a little and tell us about what type of work you're looking to get into (purely sketching, finished pencil work, painting, etc) because a lot of different mediums can be used in ""sketching"""
10113,"Looking to learn fundamentals (as I'm just starting), particularly pencil work and cartooning!"
10114,"if you are just starting and doing practice sketching to study shapes and forms or anatomy, usually a fine surfaced sketchbook or a medium surface sketchbook will do. If you browse through the books at an art store the cover will usually tell you what kind of paper it is and what types of pencils work best. Also Strathmore sketchbooks are usually decently priced and put all the info you should need on the cover about what kind of drawings the paper is for. They have several different series of varying qualities. Personally I used the 400 series for random stuff http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81LHjC9SW%2BL._SL1200_.jpg

I use a black spiraled sketchbook for school aimed work or finished drawings. You can spend big bucks on those, or find them occasionally at dollar stores with decent quality paper. They're great to start out with if you want a cover you can personalize or think it looks more professional, also the covers don't rip off like sketchpads tend to. They are more like a ""book"" http://images.utrechtart.com/products/optionLarge/Strathmore/strathmore_fieldDrawing.jpg

for pencils just pick up a set from H4 to B8, which are relatively easy to find. You can also usually find them at the dollar store, but the ones from the art store tend to break less and sharpen easier. Also be sure to get a rubber eraser as well as a kneaded eraser so you can mold it and not smear your other lines (it's kind of like play doh) http://www.watercolorpainting.com/drawing/materials/erasers400294.jpg"
10115,i rock those all lead pencils
10116,"I'll chime in with a vote for lead holders, get yourself a nice Mars Technico or something of the sort.  
  
Pigma Microns are pretty solid pens with a nice true black when scanned, but if you have the time and funds to spare I'd personally recommend trying out dip pens and brushes and inks.  
  
Paper is a pretty personal matter, Canson has some decent, cheaper sketchbooks as does Strathmore, and most of the papers both brands produce outside of that are nice too."
10117,If you're willing to spend a little extra money there are [lead holders](http://www.dickblick.com/products/alvin-b2-lead-holder/) that are really handy used with [Staedtler lead](http://www.dickblick.com/products/staedtler-leads/).
10118,And don't forget the [lead pointer](http://www.dickblick.com/products/staedtler-mars-lead-pointer/)
10119,"Shit son, I had a whole thing typed up about lead holders and pointers; now no need. The only thing I would add about my own personal process is that I like doing all my preliminary sketches and studies on tracing paper, that way you can easily transfer or rearrange elements depending on how you want your final composition to come out. Oh and speaking of transfers, the fine lead powder created by the lead pointer is ideal for doing graphite transfers onto illustration board or canvas or shatever."
10120,"Any pencil dark enough to make a decent shadow without tearing or deforming the paper you are using. The pencils don't matter. 

I knew a dude in college who reproduced [Rubens's Prometheus Bound](http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/104468.html) with an 8 color Prang watercolor set (the kind you use in elementary school).

Practice."
10121,"Best reply. Start with any tool that can make a wide range of shades and get to drawin. Unless you are selling your art, the quality of your tools matters little. 

Not that you do this OP, but a lot of people hide behind high quality tools. I've seen people shell out hundreds of dollars for markers and pens and pencils and electric erasers and god knows what. Their art still sucks, surprise.

10122,"Honestly? You don't need a full set, I find myself only ever using a 4H, a 2H, an HB, 2B and a 5B.

However, Staedtler makes pretty decent pencils. Don't go crazy and get the 32152452 pencil set, you only -really- need pencils ranging from 4H to 6B.

But while you are getting those pencils, make sure to pick up the rest of the supplies: A white [vinyl eraser](http://www.dickblick.com/items/21500-1002/?clickTracking=true&wmcp=google&wmcid=items&wmckw=21500-1002&CAWELAID=520010530000015242&gclid=CJ_Pw6KLqrcCFe07MgodNVYA5Q), as well as a [kneaded gum eraser](http://www.dickblick.com/products/prismacolor-kneaded-rubber-erasers/).

10123,">Honestly? You don't need a full set, I find myself only ever using a 4H, a 2H, an HB, 2B and a 5B.

those are what you have found to work, but OP should still get a full set to find which pencils work for them."
10124,Did you stop reading at that line? I then went on to recommend a set with a certain range.
10125,"HB regular pencils, different pencils wont make you a better artist"
10126,"Not really. Yes. No.

With only HB pencils, you're going to suffer from a drawing that lacks dark shadows, and highlights are going to be washed out, because HBs put down value too quickly for the upper threshold of highlights.

However, if I was only allowed to have one pencil for a drawing, I'd probably choose an HB. They are pretty flexible."
10127,"Go ahead and get yourself some charcoal pencils. 
Then, let's hear you speak."
10128,"I prefer crosshatching to regular shading, and I feel like charcoal is too messy."
10129,"Yes, charcoal is pretty messy. But I like the depth that it adds."
10130,"You're both wrong. And right.

Pencils don't matter if you don't know how to use them properly. The problem is amateurs don't know how, and it causes their work to suffer greatly."

10133,Saving this for future reference. I always have no idea which pencils to buy and how to use them properly.
10134,"I really enjoy Staedtler Mars Lumograph sets. They have a wide range of shades, the quality is excellent and they aren't too expensive."
10135,Will try them out. Thanks.
10229,I've been using a [$10 one from Japan](https://www.bunbougu.com.au/products/uni-kuru-toga-auto-lead-rotation-mechanical-pencil-pipe-slide-0-5-mm?variant=27849861763&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&gclid=CjwKCAiAj-_xBRBjEiwAmRbqYhSJLl0PJ3xROLd8719TwOkMYt9iXLxkVHHO-eNnRAh04SBZ5T7adxoCejIQAvD_BwE) that rotates the lead as you draw for about 11 years now.
10230,"These are fantastic, I've tried out a few types and really love the sliding lead pencil as well as the gel grip one. I hate using anything else at this point lol."
10231,"Just bought one on eBay to try out

UPDATE
been using it for a few days, feels great and draws well! Cheaper than rotring too"
10232,Jetpens.com has them too
10233,I've used these for years. Love them.
10234,"I used one of these for my entire time in high school they‚Äôre sick. When I went to college I upgraded to a rotring because I wanted that metal feel, and it feels great, but it took a while to get used to not always having the perfect tip."
10236,"Is the metal textured? I'd love a heavier one just for the feel, but I dislike a lot of metal grips"
10237,"My first & only quality mechanical pencil, the Uni Kuru Toga Roulette 0.5mm, has completely replaced all my pencil sets for sketching & I have absolutely no complaints. I think the only difference is a metal casing on the Roulette though I'd personally probably prefer the thicker grip of your version, the Roulette is still more comfortable than a standard pencil with the longevity of metal. 

Have you ever tried a RotRing to be able to give a comparison?"
10238,"I think I gave a RotRing a scribble in-store to test it, but I don't own one myself. The weight of a metal exterior is nice, but I don't typically like the ""knurled"" texture of the grip."
10239,You might want to consider a complete set of Pentel GraphGear pencils. They come in different sizes from 0.3 up to 0.9. you can get a set of 4 with refills for both the lead and erasers on Amazon for like forty bucks.
10240,Seconded!
10241,Exactly what I was going to suggest!
10242,I‚Äôve had my GraphGear 1000 for two years now; it hasn‚Äôt let me down yet!
10243,I've got one in 0.5 (model 1000) and it's a winner for sure.
10244,Great until the plaatic piece broke after 1 year
10245,I love my spoke pencil. It is a handmade customizeable one. I also have a Rotring that I love. But look up spoke designs. They are a work if art all by themselves.
10246,My dad gave me some uni Mitsubishi leadholders from his drafting days. I love leadholders for drawing 10x more than a general mechanical pencils because of the thicker lead options. They're plastic bodied but have held up.
10248,"It‚Äôs a gift for my wife who is an artist.  She sketches on a drawing pad sitting down, but will also sketch on a canvas. We are on a budget so she doesn‚Äôt want to buy herself a nice set, but a gift she can‚Äôt argue with."
10249,"Most mechanical pencils have relatively thin lead.  Sketching on canvas with a thin lead seems like it would be an exercise in frustration with the thin lead catching and breaking regularly on the rough surface.

Look for a lead holder rather than a traditional mechanical pencil.  Lead holders can take 2mm leads which would stand up to much more abuse than even the thicker mechanical pencil leads.  2mm leads also allow you to more easily vary line width because they behave more like a regular pencil lead and allow for the creation of relatively large flat spots in the lead when that is needed.

Rotring does lead holders and they have a good reputation for robust, metal bodies.  That's where I would look if I wanted to buy a metal lead holder.  On the other hand the weight of those brass bodies might be fatiguing for someone who draws a lot.  That might be worth checking with your wife prior to purchase."
10250,"In that case, I would highly recommend going with Palomino Blackwing pencils. I work as an animator and freelance illustrator and they are probably the most popular drawing tool in the industry. They‚Äôre not mechanical, but they have the perfect smoothness and easily give you both light and strong dark lines."
10251,"Palomino Blackwings are incredible! When they started production again like 8-10 years ago I think, I bought a pack for a friend and used them a few times. Smooth/10, it was like the Segway of pencils, just moving like you want it to."
10252,"What about a gift card to somewhere like [Jetpens](https://www.jetpens.com/), or a local shop?"
10253,"For sketching, I'd recommend getting her a Caran d'Ache fixpencil or a penxo. Both are nice gifts.

If you think she'd prefer a fine line mechanical pencil that is not necessarily a technical/drafting tool, I recommend looking at a pentel orenz in 0.5. They come in a variety of nice colors she might like too."
10254,"Rotring are very good for technical sketching. I still have a 0.5mm one I got from my grandfather.

On the same vein, cross pencils are quite good, and can be cheaper if you're in the US.

For drawing, I'd concider pencils with bigger lead (2mm ore more). I'll check the brand I have at home."
10255,"I prefer leadholders to traditional mechanicals, esp for drawing/sketching (engineering technical sketches).

Rotring makes a 2mm leadholder, btw. Aluminum body, very nice. Knurling is a little too aggressive if you ask me, but still a good pencil. Staetdler also makes good plastic bodied leadholders--my favorite feature of this pencil is the sharpener in the tube cap--which comes in handy more often than you'd think.

My favorite pencil for drawing/sketching is my Lamy 5.6mm lead holder, which is quite t h i c c, but is a joy to use."
10256,"I tutor math and can go through pencils. I've found these to be the most reliable, and they last for years. I tend to lose them before ever wearing them out. I love the .9mm because it never breaks under pressure like the .7mm can.

[Bic Velocity Original](https://www.amazon.com/BIC-Velocity-Original-Mechanical-2-Count/dp/B000GOYCMC/ref=sr_1_38?qid=1580995956&refinements=p_n_feature_keywords_two_browse-bin%3A4928953011&s=office-products&sr=1-38)"
10257,"I use Rotring, although I'm not sure there's anything that makes them functionally better than other pencils. For me, it's more about the weight of them. There's some psychological benefit to them feeling like tools, but I could see how other people might find them cumbersome."
10258,One thing to consider is maybe a couple of different sized ones?  Honestly anything from Japan is great but I'm biased.
10259,"Rotring 600, in 0.7 mm. By far the best mechanical pencil that I have even experienced. Hands down.

For about 20 years I've used 0.5 mm mechanical pencils such as Pentel, and I was satisfied with them.  But switching over to Rotring was unbelievable.  It really surprised me how easy it was to write with it.  It seems weird to say that -- I mean, it is just a mechanical pencil, so I was surprised how surprised I was, as well.  

I am not sure why I strongly prefer Rotring over the various other mechanical pencils that I've used in the past.  Maybe it is the feel of the solid construction.  Maybe it is the metal cut grip.  Maybe it is that it has very little play.  Maybe it is its high weight.  

I switched from 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm and from HB (No. 2) to B (No.1) lead, and that may have also made a big difference.  

Any downsides? Well, it does not have a retractable point like many of the high-end mechanical pencils, so you cannot put in your pocket.  It needs to remains on your desk or in some carrying case.  If you want the retractable point, you'd have to get the Rotring 800."
10260,Staedtler 925.  $11 or so on Amazon.  I just bought my kid one to do his homework with and now he's super excited when he has to do homework.
10261,"Mechanical pencils are great for precise lines, and you can get them in a variety of widths (thinnest I ever saw was 0.1mm) But to get some hardcore drawing done, I'd want to find mechanical pencil lead with a variety of hardnesses as well. Don't know if that exists or if it's worth the trouble, but I'll just lurk a bit and see if anyone else knows. Anyway.

I've had these 0.3mm and 0.5mm, of these [Pentel](https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-0-3mm-Mechanical-Pencil-Barrel/dp/B000WH2WSO/ref=sr_1_12?crid=1VKRKPOJ73I3X&keywords=0.3mm+mechanical+pencil&qid=1581012129&sprefix=0.3mm+mechanical+pencil%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-12) drafting mechanical pencils for about ten years and they still work great. I don't even begin to take good care of them and have had no problems."
10262,"I don‚Äôt do artistic drawings, but for field mapping I use pentel graphgear pencils. They‚Äôre phenomenal."
10170,"Great list! As a minor point of order: Tombow‚Äôs Mono and Mono 100 are different product lines with different price points.  The ‚Äú100‚Äù refers to the graphite density in the core, with ‚Äú10 billion particles per cubic millimeter,‚Äù according to Tombow‚Äôs advertising materials."
10171,"That is true. I did some research and found that the MONO 100 used to just be the ‚ÄúHomo-Graph,‚Äù which is still written on the barrel. From what I have read, the Homo-Graph is the MONO 100 for the U.S. market. I am not sure why there are separate labels."
10172,"I've not had much luck with General's pencils, the cores always seem to have gritty bits in them that I find particularly jarring when I'm writing. 

For an American made pencil I don't think you can beat Musgrave's new Tennessee Reds, with a dark smooth core and red cedar slats, they are a treat to the eye and the nose!"
10173,"I agree completely about General's pencils. Interestingly enough, before the Layout pencil's typography was upgraded, the core was smoother. I deemed it usable, which is not something I can say about the new Layout. This leads me to believe they cut costs over the years and changed the formulas to keep them low. The Cedar Pointe, while not being very smooth, is soft and not too bad to write with, which is why I put it in the honorable mentions.

As for the Musgrave news, I am looking into it now, but from what I read (and saw) [here](https://weeklypencil.com/the-weekly-pencil/2019/12/29/new-offerings-from-musgrave), it looks like Musgrave making some fantastic changes! These new pencils look amazing, and I am glad the cores are getting better. Thank you for bringing this up! I own a Harvest No. 1 and it was pretty mediocre. I am glad they have made a better version. To top it all off, $9 is the same price at the Mitsubishi 9852 EW pencils. It's all good news from here."
10174,I am a big fan of the Musgrave scoring pencil and the Harvest. I do like all the Japanese pencils you mention but I think the Musgrave compares favorably.
10175,"Musgrave did not make many pencils for themselves before. It is good to see them sticking to classic designs while making new products, especially in 2019/2020 when most U.S. pencil companies might as well have been considered dead. 

The only Musgrave pencil I have is the Harvest #1. I found some [Standard Issue Supplies No. 2](https://designworksink.com/collections/pens-pencils/products/58e51c0e1b10e3709ea7025f) pencils that look and feel like Musgrave pencils (and they write like if the Harvest had a 2B option). SIS is also based in Tennessee, according to what I read, which makes me believe it even more that they are made by Musgrave.

 I plan to get the Bugle, Ceres, Tennessee Red, Harvest Professional, and News 600 pencils. I am a big fan of the traditional lettering and stylized fonts they use.

Many US pencil manufactures make a lot of pencils for other brands, and do not always make many of their own. Moon Product's website looks like a joke, and  General's makes many pencils that mostly feel and look the same (and are pretty cheap, both in price and build). Musgrave looks like the only serious US competitor in the pencil market."
10177,"Thank you! The paper I used is from a Leuchtturm1917 notebook. Blue, dot grid."
10178,You should include a sniff test in future reviews.  Nice results thanks for sharing :)
10179,"Hah, that‚Äôs a good idea! I could also add the wood if I know. Thanks for the tip."
10180,"Any writing utensil will do for quick sketches on the go as I don't like carrying a pencil pouch and stick to a mechanical pencil and sketch pad.
When I actually have a piece I wish to refine or actually work on then any art pencil works. Led is led and charcoal is charcoal. I just go to Hobby Lobby and grab a small variety set of 9H to 9B that they have. I also buy a smaller black leather bound sketch pad (for my on the go) and a more larger/normal one."
10181,Do you have any favorite brands for the 9H to 9B variety set?
10182,Maybe Royal and Lagnickel? They're about $2USD cheaper (at least around here) and I also like their watercolor pencils (to help with the lighter watercolors).
10183,"For me, I find the best option is using 32lb/120gsm paper (it's thick enough that basic pen and ink doesn't show through) and a couple of decent quality pencils like Derwent Academy or pick up a mechanical pencil. I tend to keep in the 3H-3B range for leads.

For inking, I use fineliners - my brand is Uni Pin, but Sakura, Copic, Derwent Graphik, and Staedtler are others I've seen. I use my 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 the most."
10184,Thank you very much :)
10185,Thanks buddy :)
10186,"There are some good ideas in this thread on what to look for in pencils (Faber-Castel and the like), but do yourself a favor and invest in pencil-extenders and kneaded erasers if you do go pencil-heavy.
Kneaded erasers tend to not leave any shavings, and also can be molded into whatever shape you desire. Best of luck!"
10187,"It's not about the tools, but the application of the tools.
Any pencil, marker, pen or paint will do. You just have to experiment and find something that suits you today (and be prepared change it tomorrow). 

The greatest addition to my mechanical pencil, which I use for all my pencil drawings, was a red pencil, a white pencil and grey/brownish paper."
10188,"a regular bic pen can be one of the best.

I also like these inexpensive japanese pens called Multiball. They are roller balls, but have a slight texture to the ball so you can feel it on the paper. 

Hit up jetpens.com for all your pen porn needs.

#2 and bic can be the best though."
10189,"A few things I would recommend is a trusty pencil, a pen, and eraser and marker combination.  You obviously don't need all of these things, but it is a good basic set that will allow you a relatively wide range of choices.  

If your mechanical pencil works well for you, add that to your bag.  For a good drawing pencil set, I recommend something like a Staedtler pencil set. I personally use this [12 pencil tin](http://www.staedtler.ca/Mars_Lumograph_na.Staedtler#ctl08_Tab-product-tab-2) - but because I favour ink over pencil, I don't use it very often.  However, when I am working specifically with graphite or some project, I will default to that set.  

For me, a Pentel mechanical pencil with .5 mm leads, .5 mm Pilot Precise pens, some Sharpies and a Staedtler Mars plastic eraser are my basics.  I stick with these brands because I grew up using them, so I am very familiar with them and thus how to work them to my advantage.  In addition, I would recommend them because the product quality has been consistent and good over the years.  The pencil I use, in fact, was discontinued nearly a decade ago.  However, these pens and pencils happen to fit with my drawing /writing style, so obviously you might want to try different things, but these have all worked very well for me in a variety of situations.

I have a plethora of sketchbooks and notebooks, because I tend to compulsively draw or sketch.  I mostly use pen and ink, drawing not only in the sketchbooks but also napkins, stray bits of paper, coffee cups, and whatever is around me.  That's where the Sharpies come in handy - an ultra-fine black sharpie is what I often use.  I always carry a small sketchpad with me just so I can jot down ideas that I think I might want to elaborate upon later or want consistent /better paper quality.

My absolute basics would be some sort of notepad or sketchpad (anything with binding that night be able to protect the paper edges),  black .5 mm [Pilot Precise pen](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/185-Precise-V5-V7.aspx) and my mechanical pencil.  I highly recommend Staedtler's [Mars plastic eraser](http://www.staedtler.ca/Mars_plastic_na) - it erases very cleanly and doesn't stain paper or rip it up.

As for the list you provided, these are the products I would recommend based on use /experience:

**An easy to erase, (non-photo) blue or red pencil for initial sketches** I personally would stick to your default pencil unless you plan on doing a lot of scanning and your sketching is a bit wild.  I really try to keep things simple / use objects that are flexible or can be multi-purpose.

**A set of traditional pencils (2H, HB and 2B maybe) and a pencil sharpener or knife** The Staedtler pencil sets have the combination you mentioned and are very good quality pencils.  I also carry an X-acto handle with a box of #11 blades.

**A mechanical pencil (0.5/0.7/0.9 with HB leads) for details** I use a Pentel mechanical pencil, but it's no longer being made.  I am not sure I could recommend one other than that, but I have had very good experience with Pentel and their mechanical pencils.  I recommend a slim pencil that is easy to modify your grip upon - one without a thickened handle or strange form.  


**Eraser(s)** A Staedtler Mars plastic eraser.  I have tried a few other plastic erasers (and of course other erasers), but for the reasons mentioned above, I very much prefer this eraser.

**Some black (or gray?) pens** Pilot Precise v5/v7 pens - I use the .5 mm pens.  

**Set of maybe 15 grey scale and/or brown markers** Prismacolor makes a few really great sets of [warm, cool and neutral gray, dual-tipped markers](http://www.prismacolor.com/products/art-markers/double-ended) that are really great.  To be honest, I had a kind of low expectation from them, but the markers really are quite good.  I've only used the grey sets and one of the color sets in terms or their markers, though.  I believe there were 12 to a set.  This link will probably give you [a better idea of the format](http://www.dickblick.com/products/prismacolor-premier-double-ended-art-markers/) - Prismacolor's site was messy and not fun to navigate."
10190,"Pilot hi tec-c pens are great for fine line sketching and have a surprising range of line weight. The ink isn't waterproof, but sometimes that's a good thing. I prefer them over the microns, which are more fragile and less versatile IMHO. Happy sketchin!"
10191,"You can go as crazy as you want, but do not lose sight of what you have purchased. It is a sketchbook. It is nothing other than a sketchbook and you should be able to feel free to sketch with whatever the hell you want. Use your kid brother's crayons if you feel like it. Pencils. Bic pens. The burnt tortilla that fell off your plate. There is nothing written anywhere that you need to go buy something special to draw on a sketchbook and I am willing to bet you will have more fun experimenting than buying yourself a set of pens and locking yourself down to it. Have fun man...or woman...whatever you are."
10192,"Copics are AMAZING.  I highly recommend them.  They're expensive, but totally worth it."
10193,http://www.idsketching.com/thesketchlab/materials-guide/
10194,"Okay, since you're already sure you like drawing, go ahead and spring for some decent tools.

I'm a big fan of Derwent pencils. Faber-Castell is also good stuff. Personally I now have the full gamut from 9h-9b, but I don't use them all for sketching by any means. :)

I would get a white plastic eraser and a kneaded eraser. All the good pencil makers also offer good erasers as far as I know.

For pens, you could get something like some Micron liners, or brush pens, or even just sharpies. Whatever feels good in your hands, really. I'm currently in lust with the Rotring ArtPen.

How much do you use markers? Copics are awesome, but very spendy. You could get something cheaper if you don't know if you like them or how much you'll use them. I got some F-C PITT brush markers and they're quite nice.

> An easy to erase, (non-photo) blue or red pencil for initial sketches

You may be going a bit overboard for a sketch book. Part of the point of sketching is to improve your spontaneity and to finish quick pictures, not to finish planned pieces. I've even seen suggestions that you only sketch in pen so you can't erase.

Personally I don't go that far, but there's no reason you can't just do light construction lines with a hard pencil and either leave them (for rough sketches) or erase them once your ink is down."
10195,"If you're using the non-photo blue or poppy(maybe crimson) red pencils you must be wanting to scan your sketches? That's really about the only reason I think you would *need* them (unless you just like the way they draw, which I do, lol). If scanning is your plan, don't worry about their ability to be erased, because the whole idea behind the reds and blues is how easy they are to remove in photoshop. 

As for erasers, I really like the standard issue Staedler white eraser...its an o,d stand by. Also get yourself a kneadable eraser too because they can be super usefull. Also try sticky-tack. We used that in college when we were too poor to afford kneadable erasers, and they turned out to be oretty awesome at the job."
10196,"You don't need all these fancy pens and pencils. Just get a decent set of pencils and a nice eraser. You don't wanna come home after spending a boat load of money, draw two times, and then never draw again."
10197,"Nah, I don't mind investing some money into things like this.  
Would I get a 300 color set of copic markers right away, that would indeed be unreasonable. But a few good pencils, pens and maybe a dozen markers, I think that's something you can risk. :P"
10198,"I'd avoid the Copic markers for now. Perfect your drawing and understanding of color theory, and then worry about fancy tools. I've never found markers to be user-friendly, and they feel limiting, especially because you don't have much freedom with color. 

I *am* a huge fan, though, of coloring pen and pencil drawings with watercolor. There's plenty of [fancy](http://www.dickblick.com/products/sakura-koi-watercolor-sketch-box-travel-pan-sets/) travel-[kits](http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Watercolor-Field/dp/B000N9B3WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325877163&sr=8-1) of [various](http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-amp-Newton-Cotman-Colour/dp/B001GWJ2XM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1325877163&sr=8-5) sizes [as well](http://www.dickblick.com/products/blockx-watercolors-half-pan-travel-sets/), and [waterbrushes](http://www.dickblick.com/products/niji-waterbrush/) work surprisingly well though you should get comfortable with using a regular brush first. [Or you can make your own](http://www.instructables.com/id/Movable-Pallet-Altoid-Tin-Watercolor-Set/)."

10200,"strathmore lead holder for a pencil. nothing beats it, has a built in sharpner. i also use strathmore pens, but many people use microns, and for the more frugal, faber castel., get a variation of mm from .05mm to .5-.8mm pens, dont use any pencil lead lighter than 2B. you can get any light mark with a 2B and it wont scrath and scar and make terrible marks like an H will"
10201,"Glad we're on the same page there. I can't tell you how often I see people run out, spend over a hundred dollars on art supplies, get frustrated, and then never draw again."
10202,"I really like Faber-Castel stuff.

and these pens.  A Small tip and a Brush tip black, then brush tips for the grays and what ever colors you want.
http://www.dickblick.com/products/faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens/

Just go down to your local art store and buy the ones you want individually.  I burn through the black brush tips pretty quickly so I usually buy them a few at a time.

10203,Why that eraser?  Always thought the white ones are better?
10204,I just like that brand and that shape.  I've used both colors and didn't really notice much difference.
10205,"I made a little vid of the basics. Here ya go!
http://youtu.be/yhDKDx605nQ"
10206,Excellent question again. I will make you another video re: drawing supplies. There are many tricks.
10207,"Sorry for the huge post, but pencils are one of my favourite things!

Get a few hardnesses of pencil, HB is middle; B is soft & H is hard. I usually have an HB, a 2B and a 4B. 

A good quality sharpener - cheap, crappy ones can make life a misery and stop you getting a nice point on your tip. 

A really good quality eraser is worth the little bit extra and should be lifting the graphite off the paper - without needing a lot of force or damaging the paper. 

Also, buy some cheap cotton gloves and cut the thumb, pointer finger and middle finger bits off. If you wear it while drawing it really helps keep the smudging from your hand to a minimum, and the oils from your hands coating the surface of the paper. 

Post-it notes are great as re-positionable masks, and so is scotch brand sticky tape.

Get some decent quality paper, have a look at the ""grain"" of it, is it bumpy or smooth? Is it uniform or organic? ; and it's weight: the weight is the best indicator of thickness: 80gsm is what printer/copy paper is, and the ""cartridge"" paper I am using at the moment is around 160/170gsm. It's really what you like using. 

Good quality supplies are not always the most expensive, but ""student"" quality is generally at the cheap and nasty end of the spectrum. Not sure where in the world you are, here in Australia initial startup cost would look a lot like this:

1, Visual diary (sketch pad, A3 size) between $10-$15

2, 3 x Pencils, (graphite, sketching pencils) purchased individually, about $2 each. Coloured pencils are a different price and I use prismacolour or derwents. These can be bought either in packs or individually, they are well worth the cost, and can start at $2.40 on up. There are a lot of different sized and costed packs. 

3, Eraser, anywhere between $2 and $5

4, Gloves about $4 pack of 2 pairs.

5, Sharpener about $3 for a good quality one.

For these bits: approximately $30. 

I also keep a french curve template with my gear, and a math/geometry set. I am a bit clinical in how I approach subject matter, but most people aren't. These can be everywhere between $2 and $15.

Most importantly, you can build up a stash of tools, the wonderful thing with pencils is they don't dry up and don't disintegrate over time. 

Have fun!"
10208,That doesn't sound too bad. Thanks for the advice! :) I'll definitely be buying some of this soon.
10209,"I checked at Big W, and you should be able to get set up for even less, pencils are about $1, visual diaries are less there too :0)"
10210,W: Wal-mart you say? I didn't know they had much in the way of art supplies. I'll take a peek. Thanks! :)
10211,"Big W is like Kmart, sorry forgot you were probably in the US"
10212,"Yeah, I only know one W around here. :) Close enough regardless."
10213,"1. Pencil

2. Paper.

My art teacher once said ""An artist is only as good as his tools."" She was an idiot. Seriously, you don't need to go spend money on tons of crap, it wont make you a better artist. And it certainly does not help beginners, it just makes it seem like there's more to learn. Get good with your regular pencil. Then maybe get one different weight pencil and try it out, depending out what you think you need. You don't need to go buy 24 different weights, all that will happen is that you'll try them once and have no idea when to use them. Only I would actually suggest is one of those grey claylike erasers, those make erasing big things easier, are nicer to the paper and last longer than solid erasers. But even that's not needed. What IS needed is time and practice and sticking with it. Good luck!"
10214,"Oh, yeah, I definitely need a good eraser. The ends of pencils don't always do a spectacular job. :)"
10215,"Thanks for the reply. I have been drawing pretty happily so far with my primitive tools, the only thing that really frustrated me was the lack of contrast when shading with it. But I think I will stick with what I have and maybe buy a few cheap extras. Thanks for the encouragement! :)"
10216,"Well thats good, you've already identified what you need, so maybe go out and buy one very dark one and one very light one. I just don't advocate people going out and buying 20 different pencils when they aren't even used to their first one. Sounds like you might be ready though."

I was introduce to this technique by a baggage handler and it made me realized how futile locks are...

If you want to protect your stuff theft while travelling you should consider a [pelican case] (http://www.pelican-case.com/pelican-cases-for-travel.html). They are bulky but it s the only way to be sure.

Personally i just keep my valuables with me in my carry on."
10267,I also do this when it's available.
10268,Forgot about those! You're absolutely right!
10269,"The pen-in-zipper trick is neat but I'm generally trying to deter opportunistic grabbing. I recognize that anyone with time and/or master keys can get into the bag already, so I always keep valuables in my carry on. But when I don't lock my bags they often get rummaged through, and clothes or shoes get removed."
10270,Get actual locks and a starter pistol. Declare it at the counter. Never have your luggage opened again.
10271,"Following this as well.  Don't understand why you can't make a normal sized padlock with the TSA key tumbler inside, the Master ones I've bought at Ace/Home Depot have been absolute garbage and have had 3 of them break and come loose in the last year of travel."
10272,"Uh you do know all TSA locks have a universal key, right?"
10273,"Obviously. But not every baggage handler in every airport has one of these. Since I'm trying to prevent really low-effort opportunistic theft (of clothes, shoes, etc), this still makes sense for me."
10274,"I'm just saying an actual lock would be better, because any luggage thief worth their salt would have a key for those locks. Especially in the US."
10275,And the TSA would routinely break those locks if they're not TSA-approved.
10276,"That's if they need to open them without you. Mine get opened very rarely, and when they have they've always just asked for a key."
10277,"Mine have been opened on every recent trip where I checked bags, so I guess YMMV."
10278,"Oh....well I am a skinny white kid, so I rarely get searched. My dad on the other hand has had a similar experience and he's none of those things."
10279,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Goruck/comments/854zy0/how_can_i_lock_up_my_goruck/

Here‚Äôs an old post showing how calmly and reasonably people could discuss this back in 2018.

The upshot seems to be 1. you‚Äôd have to feed some wire through the zipper bodies since you can‚Äôt padlock paracord; 2. someone could just cut the fabric so it‚Äôs not great security anyway; 3. safest thing is just to keep your bag in sight at all times; 4. people feel very strongly about the concept of locking a ruck."
10280,"Thread some of those cable ""key rings"" like [THESE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071GNKJNK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_Bpn2Fb30NA2AZ) through gutted paracord.  

Use some heavy duty heat shrink with the adhesive in it to heatshrink the pulls, but leave some room toward the zipper head that you could slide a small lock through. 

Should be strong enough that they would cut your bag to get inside, or just ""pen"" open the zipper."
10282,"It won't be exactly the same as the original pulls, but should do. Don't connect the keyring ends, just leave them in the gutted paracord, slip the heat shrink over them and then tie the over hand knot in just the paracord, right at the end of the key rings. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to hold the cable together towards the zipper pull when heat shrinking. Let the heat shrink cool so it holds the looped cable."
10283,Zip ties work great
10284,I don't bother. Pick up the hobby of lockpicking and you'll realize you can open a TSA lock in a few seconds with minimal practice.
10285,"I use one with a thinner U and it goes right through the holes of the zipper pulls. 

Does it provide actual safety? No. 
Does it deter people from craming around or pick pocketing? Yes."

10299,"1. Always keep your baggage claim ticket. If the airline loses your bag, they have to pay if you have your ticket. Not having your ticket absolves them of paying.

2. Read the terms. They will not pay for lost electronics, cameras, computers, etc. You have to carry that shit on.
