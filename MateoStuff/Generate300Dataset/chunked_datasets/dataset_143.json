45953,Take 5.
45954,"CANDY CORN! Trick or treaters might not like it, but that just means more for you. To me the stuff is like crack."
45955,Cadaver floss.
45956,You'll have the best day of your life if you make a sandwich from two Reese's Peanut Butter Cups with a Snickers bar in between.  MMmmm...
45957,WTF
45958,Fry it in bacon grease.
45959,My mom always gives out the best candy because she buys those little paper bags with ghosts on them and then fills them with three or four different pieces of candy. Even better is when she has lots of leftovers and gives me all the extra bags.
45960,Anyone else ever get pennies?
45961,"""Dammit lady I want some candy not ass pennies!"""
45962,I would say chocolate. The reasons are that for one thing I'm a chocaholic lol and it's also completely safe and parent-nag free for kids with braces.
45963,"""Oh you have braces? Here's some jujyfruits.""

I'm definitely going to do that... I am evil."
45964,"My dad, as a Coca-Cola chemist, always gave out varieties of soda, asking kids which one they preferred. He stocked up on every variety. They loved it, and the parents would sometimes even ask for one. When out for that long collecting candy, you get thirsty. Give those costumed kids some bubbly candy-water. As a plus, left-overs make great mixers!"
45965,reese's or any full-size candy bar.
45966,"Full size candy bars. Anything without coconut - but I highly recommend you save those for the neighborhood kids. 

Otherwise, faster than you can say Twitter or Hobo Code - you'll be scooped out and run asunder by the advancing hoards."
45967,"Agreed, Mounds are the worst candy ever made."
45968,"what the hell, theres people that eat those, i thought they were made to die in the vending machine."
45969,"* Chocolate *anything*

* Gummy *anything*

I fucking hate hard candy."
45970,I'm a fan of apple Jolly Ranchers and fun-sized Snickers.
45971,Pennies.  If you hate kids.
45972,"Free, because nothing tastes as good as that."
45973,Bite-size Snickers - somehow more tasty to me than the normal size
45974,"Sugarless, vitamin-enriched and with a little ""Plan B"" added for the teenagers."
45975,This isn't candy but the house that gave out glow stick necklaces each year was always popular.  We would find the kids with them on and work backwards to find out which house was giving them out.  It was something different than candy that wasn't a Wendy's coupon or a handful of pennies.
45976,"Anything with white chocolate, peanut butter, or caramel."
45977,Rockets
45978,"Apples.


HAHAHAHA...."
45979,Toblerones.
45980,"kids luv bubblegum i have noticed.

i luv sourpatch kids + crybabies."
45981,"Popcorn balls.  You can use either corn syrup, sugar or caramel to get them to stick together.  Obviously caramel is the best option.  Make sure you cover the razor blades completely in popcorn before you compress them into a ball, you don't want to cut your hands while putting the treats together.  Wrap it up in a bit of saran wrap and tie a ribbon on it, perfect."
45982,Did anyone actually eat Almond Joys?
45983,Any full sized chocolate candy bar
45984,Someone else's.
45985,Smarties.
45986,"You want candy that is just bad enough that no kids will take it but good enough where you can tolerate eating it yourself. I think Almond Joys, butterscotch candies and those pineapple looking things."
45987,"Trader Joe's used to sell these 5 pounds candy bars. I always wanted to buy a few of those and give them out on Halloween but, alas, they haven't stocked them in years."
45988,"I have always liked Rockets (I understand they are called Smarties in the US?).

Basically sugar disks, but whatever."
45989,"FULL, not ""fun size,"" anything..."
45990,"Pennies, fuck, i used to get pennies, and i hated it... now?  Shit, I'll take  them cents."
45991,"Flavor Rolls.   Fuck, I love those things."
45992,Best Halloween [Candy](http://imgur.com/rdqe6).
45993,[Mellowcreme Pumpkins ](http://www.charlieschocolatefactory.com/candy/halloween/pumpkins.jpg)
45994,Bubblegum cigars (and candy cigarettes if you can still find them.) And those horrible little wax bottles full of liquid.  And wax lips.
45995,"That brought back a flood of nostalgia.  Bad nostalgia; nastalgia, if you will."
45996,The homemade candy is the best.  Shows that you care.
45998,Yeah especially them Pineapple ones. GOT DAYUM
45999,"Hol up

THERES PINEAPPLE FLAVOR?"
46000,"There’s [strawberry, pineapple, lemon, cherry, and orange!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N1QF0G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_ERcPDb8Q1WMTC)"
46001,3 OTHER FLAVORS?! HOLY SHIT
46002,I've had peach/nectarine before too! They're all delicious
46003,Definitely commenting so I can look this up kart
46004,Those look like Chinese knockoffs.
46005,I'll try a bit-o-granny
46006,Dude. You just began your second life.
46007,They are called strawberry bonbons and they are indeed “super good.”
46008,They're like a Playboy Playmate in a muu muu. Shitty packaging but delectable once unwrapped.
46009,Judging by your terminology you're 50+
46010,The strawberry and butterscotch (labeled under old timer apparently) are secret S tier candies. You never think about them until you dump out the bag and are pleasantly surprised.
46011,"I always buy the strawberry ones at dollar tree, never seen them anywhere else"
46012,Came here to post this. That's the first thing that i would eat. Also werthers origninals are top tier. No one dislikes those.
46013,"I mean, we all shit on em for being the poster boy for old people candy, but we all know they're the shit.  Peer pressure a motherfucker"
46014,"Yep, best part is that the ignorant will practically give them away during trade because they are young and foolish"
46015,"Woah there now hol up, that old timer's ""worthless"" candy has every appearance of a Werther's Original hard candy (also available in soft caramel). I happen to have one in my mouth AT THIS VERY MOMENT and can vouch for it's creamy succulent yummy in my tummyness!

You might say it's a generic butterscotch candy. NAY! The wrapper is quite clearly opaque in the middle and partially translucent on the sides, also being oval and referred to as ""worthless"", a clear and undignified jab at this time tested classic.

I will say GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.

also I really do have one in my mouth rn"
46016,"If I leave a bag of those things out at work, *everyone* gets into it and it's gone quick."
46017,"To be fair, there’s a lot of stuff you could leave out at work that would also get eaten really quickly"
46018,"Most people at my job leave other people's stuff alone. I don't mean leave out as in a candy bowl, I mean we don't have desks and people leave the stuff they're snacking on at the water cooler. The only thing people get so tempted by that they think no one will notice if they take a few (and inevitably more and more until half the bag is gone because they keep going back) is Werthers and Jolly Ranchers."
46019,Oh ok
46020,"When I first tried those sweets, I gushed about them to anyone who would listen, they tick all of my boxes AND have a pretty decent list of ingredients. One of the best candy out there! This guide has no business insulting them! 

I am not too worked up about hard candy, I promise."
46021,Now you’re on the trolley!
46022,"Those old school soft caramels > milkyway 

don't@ me"
46023,"I mean... Milky Way is just a neutered Snickers, so most things > Milky Way."
46024,"Milky ways just piss me off.  If I had a choice between a Zero bar, Almond Joy, Mounds, or a Milky way, I'd throw them all away and just snack on a carrot for Halloween."
46025,"I’ll add, not as beautifully eloquent as you, Wherther’s are a pricey candy comparatively and aren’t located with the bagged Halloween candy. The givers are committed to sharing quality and introducing the next generation to a standard matched by few."
46026,"Old timer doesn't mean bad, just reminds you of nana"
46027,"I’m a legend for purely personal reasons, I’m sick of being stuck with leftover candy that I won’t eat"
46028,Then why give any away?
46029,I think he means he gives a shitload out to every kid in order to be empty by the end of the night.
46030,"I think he means that he's doesn't want to have stuff left over that he won't eat. So he just buys stuff that he would eat, himself."
46031,"Correct, I give out a lot, but want to have the good stuff for leftovers"
46032,"Halloween living on a short street: 

Sometimes you buy expecting a lot of people, and only a few show up.  If you are the only house on that street giving away candy, people will likely stick to the main road."
46033,"That’s part of my problem, as well.  Year ranges between 30 kids and 100, so on a slow year those later kids are getting the goods."
46034,"Same. Haha

We did that one year. Bought a big grab bag of assorted stuff. So many gross leftovers. 

Cases of full size Snickers and Twix for the rest of our lives."
46035,Just leave a bowl of candy outside. It'll be all gone by the fourth visitor
46036,"Or, in our neighborhood, a trash panda"
46037,"There was a house i used to hit that was GOD TIER. These people had all kinds of cool decorations and gave out pretty great candy, they also had a popcorn machine and gave out bags of freshly popped popcorn, i wanna say they also did popcorn balls but they may have been another house on the same street as there was another similar house like, 3 houses down. That street was always on the agenda to hit"
46038,Popcorn balls? What’s that
46039,"Y'know, i never really put that much thought into them. Basically its a bunch of popcorn that bas been compressed into a ball and then held together with some sort of sticky, sweet stuff. Im not exactly sure what holds it together or if it varies depending on how you make it. So you get the saltiness and crunch from the popcorn, and the sweetness feom whatever it is that holds it together. Theyre a neat little treat"
46040,Melted marshmallow maybe? I've seen them but I've never eaten one.
46041,"I guess they could, i think theres probably several ways to do it. You should try one, the cavities arent THAT bad"
46042,"Just looked it up, it’s apparently something people actually make. Looks really tasty"
46043,They are!
46044,One of my relatives makes these! It's mainly corn syrup and butter and such. Absolutely delicious. Sometimes she even puts a little caramel in them.
46045,Oooooh that sounds even better!
46046,"Really weird, I was thinking it was some tradition I was missing out on lol"
46047,"In a way i guess thwy can kinda be considered a tradition as you really only see them around this time of year. Theyre a popular Halloween treat, outside of Halloween you dont see them much"
46048,I always just used a rice crispy recipe but used popcorn instead of rice crispies when making them
46049,Oh man i could go for some rice crispy treats...
46050,"I hate to break it to you, but popcorn balls are held together by malevolent neighbor semen."
46051,That would explain why they reminded me so much of my uncle
46052,"Imagine a fist-sized wad of that sweet-and-salty kettle corn with enough sweet stuff to hold it together. There are some commercially prepared, individually packaged. Go find one, and enjoy."
46053,Think rice krispie treat but with popcorn instead of cereal.
46054,"Don’t be dissing my man Unnamed Strawberry Candy Old People Randomly Have like that. Those are a sweet little snack and every goddamn person that gives me that candy is sweeter than any Halloween candy I get

Btw I looked up what they are called and they are called Arcor Strawberry Candy"
46055,"There's a bunch of flavors it turns out. Like pineapple, lemon, a few others."
46056,"My dude, YES! I would fight my brother in armed combat for that shit if I could've!"
46057,"I never need to, for I knew how good they were and they were only concerned about the chocolate, so I'd get them pretty much for the free.  There's tech in everything, even candy"
46058,You dissing the Strawberry candy?
46059,probably hated their grandma.
46060,Where do you buys those?  They're delicious!!!
46061,"Some guy linked them in another comment, leads to Amazon"
46062,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N1QF0G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_ERcPDb8Q1WMTC
46063,CVS or Walgreens? That level of candy just feels like you buy them at a drug store like werthers and cough drops.
46064,"The strawberry ones belong in legend, also the old timers stuff was all amazing, can I eat your leftovers?"
46065,"Unpopular opinion, Smarties are actually fine candies."
46067,I like literally every candy on here except the Old Timer black and orange taffy.
46068,I came specifically to defend those! They're like peanut butter Taffy!
46069,I remember for years thinking those were bad just because I listened to my sibling and friends.
46070,Time to retroactively cut off your friends and family then /s
46071,They weeded themselves out over the years. It all worked out in the end
46072,Oh hell yes. I got a three-pound bag by me right now. They're like my once-a-year crack fix.
46073,Sure if that's all you have available
46074,"Adding Necco Wafers. They’re not god tier, but they’re far and above candy corn and pumpkins. 

The pumpkins are the fucking worst."
46075,They stopped making Necco wafers last year. Boxes of them are going for like $100 on eBay.
46076,I think I heard about the stop in production. Absolutely not surprised about the eBay thing though.
46077,"Hershey and Mars candy used to be delicious. Now it's all cheap and gross, overly sweet with nil chocolate.
I'd rather have flavorful hard candy, any day. However, to this day I could drive to the exact house where a lady gave out bananas one year. We were so depressed. They were past ripe, and more fit for baking."
46078,"The Big Three use a lot of palm oil in their chocolate these days.  Not just cheap and gross, but bad for the environment.

My sister and I have tried our best to make our house ""the cool house"" for around 20 years now.  We used to give a mix of Legend and Trusty level goods, but now we bounce around different styles based on how creative we want to get and what our finances are like that year.  Whatever it takes to not give money to the Big Three.

(Especially Nestle.  Fuck Nestle.)"
46079,My grandmother likes to give out chips or Cheez-itz from the small individual variety packs.
46080,That's better than candy in my kid's opinion.
46081,Your Grandmother is loved by God.
46082,I wonder which company made this
46083,I hand out Costco snack pak chips LUL
46084,Chaotic good
46085,Go buy your own damn candy you freeloaders.
46087,"Yeah I mean, or you could teach your kids not to be entitled dicks.

A well raised kid should be judging exactly nobody by the FREE CANDY they are handing out to children they didn’t even birth."
46088,"It's like this jackass I was talking to at a party the other day. Literally spent fifteen minutes bitching that someone else had brought in a case of rolling rock to share, instead of whatever ridiculous (probably overpriced) hipster beer he pretends to like because he thinks it makes him seem sophisticated. I don't get it."
46089,I like rolling rock. It doesn’t have a 2 hour aftertaste like that POS hipster beer. I don’t want to taste hops in my bones for a week. That’s nasty
46090,"I don't mean to diss craft brewing, there are some craft beers I really like, to me it was just the fact that he was whining that somebody didn't think to buy him his own special expensive beer at a college party. If somebody offered me a beer I didn't like, I'd just say no thanks, but I guess he felt like he was owed the particular beer he liked. I asked what beers he'd prefer, and why, and he couldn't even articulate what he liked about other beers, he just felt insulted at the free beer being, in his mind, cheap.

Edit- Now that I think of it, I'd met him once before that, and got into an argument with him over what ethnicity I am. Guy's weird."
46091,yup this is choosing beggars
46092,"Exactly. Toilet paper for cheap candy? They could just choose not to give out shit.

Plus everyone and their mama is giving out the fun sized snicker bars and skittles, I like some variety in my candy, I will gladly take the other stuff."
46093,You might be on to something...
46094,"I know I’m being a bit of a grouch, but I was raised to just be happy with what you got... if you got anything at all!"
46095,"You sir, were raised right."

46101,You're taking an internet guide about the perception of Halloween candy much too seriously 🙄
46102,Found the party pooper
46103,"Nope, try again.

As an Aussie I don’t fall into any of these, because it’s all bullshit"
46104,"I'm 100% with you. The fact that one night a year, through no fault of your own, a bunch of kids will just show up at your door and demand candy, then either judge you on the candy you give them or throw eggs at your house if you don't give them anything... that's ludicrous. We've got a similar tradition in Germany, not for Halloween but for Saint Martin's Day, where instead of throwing eggs at your house, kids sing shitty carols at you. It makes me sort of glad I'll never be able to afford a house lol."
46105,I mean... its a fun holiday and you don’t have to participate but its more fun the more participate. I highly disagree with the sentiment that ANYONE should get trashed on for not providing candy or “good enough” candy... those guys can fuck right off the privileged little shits... but if YOU don’t want to participate thats your deal and yours alone and no one actually gives a shit about your opinions on the matter. If we want to dress up and give out candy thats our business as not doing it is yours. So you can kindly shut the fuck up sir.
46106,"Yup, 100% this my dude.

I really wonder if the people arguing with me were patented at all."
46107,You're a very bitter and humorless bloke.
46108,"It’s just that when you forget the sarcasm tag, people will assume you’re a dick.

Maybe I should have just applied Hanlon’s Razor to your comment?"
46109,Quick survey.  I got full size air heads candy to give out this year.  Did I make the good bottom tier?
46110,"Mid-level score for a kid, but top 15% compared to other houses overall."
46111,"My family always gives out full chocolate bars, yet so far no local neighborhood legends have formed leading a group of friends embarking on a coming of age story visiting our house for the big score"
46112,"Venture forth, young bard and spread it yourself."
46113,"The list is certainly made up by kids, because they mistakenly think we care where we fall on the list - What you’ll get is what we can tolerate at the office as leftovers for the following week.

I’ll agree with this; if one is giving fruit and tooth brushes on halloween, don’t bother. Shut off your lights and go to bed - you’re wasting their time you schmuck."
46114,"I don't mind the toothbrushes and shit, I'll use them for something. What gets me are the houses that give a little sandwich bag with a few pennies and a piece of paper of a psalm telling kids to repent their sins. Like I would really prefer those people just not give out anything."
46115,"That's what we call a vicious Halloween feedback loop. They're preachy and uncharitable because they get egged, and kids egg them for being preachy and uncharitable."
46116,"I dunno, we got one house on our street who leaves their lights on intentionally to get kids to come to their door so they can tell them that Halloween is evil. They've never been egged or anything. Pretty sure some people are overly religious assholes when it comes to Halloween."
46117,Well they're just a-beggin' for an eggin'.

One Halloween, I completely forgot about getting candy so when trick-or-treaters arrived, I gave them what I had in my pantry and I have never seen kids smile as widely before or since. That was also the first Halloween where they actually yelled in excitement when they saw what I was handing out."
46190,How many pop-tarts did you have lady.
46191,"I lived in a small out of the way neighborhood at the time so I didn't need that many.

If you live in a high traffic trick-or-treat area, pop tarts are probably too expensive. But if you live in a neighborhood that only gets a few kids, like me, pop tarts are the way to go."
46192,"Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, hands down"
46193,"Twix, Kit Kat, Reese's cups"
46194,Anything sour
46195,Fun size SNICKERS
46196,"Not dental floss, that’s for sure."
46197,I love just sucking on those minty dental floss.
46463,Candy corn
46199,BUTTERFINGERS
46200,"Personally, I'd probably say the big Tootsie Rolls"
46201,100 Grand.
46202,Baby Ruth are better fun size
46203,Kit kats?
46204,Milky Way Midnights. The bite size are just perfect.
46205,The only thing I can say is to not just leave the bowl outside because the first kid will take all of it. Lights on is usually enough and at least in my neighborhood no one has ever actually been TPd so I don't think you need to worry about it.
46206,"Thanks! Yeah I think my neighbors are really nice. I don't think they'll raise asshole kids. I'm not super worried about TP. Just want to make sure I'm a decent neighbor myself. I don't want kids growing up saying ""you know who gave out the worst candy? Famousmodel. His house sucked!"""
46208,or apples.
46209,"Yea, preaching apples is really annoying."
46210,"""...and on the sixteenth day Granny Smith created red delicious, and it was good. Then on the seventeenth day Granny Smith created Gala, and it was also good. On the eighteenth day Granny Smith slipped on a wet step and hurt her hip. She was feeling a little off so she created crab, which was pretty disappointing. She took the next five or six days off to recuperate then she made cortland, which was also good...""

46211,Or caramel covered onions.
46212,"If you *do* get toilet papered, don't spray it with water.  That'll just make it horrible."
46213,"Depends how cheap the kids are. 1 ply just sort of dissolves if you spray it. If they just raided the pantry and took the nice stuff though, you're in for a mess."
46214,Good tip man. Thanks!
46215,Likely unnecessary.  Have fun tomorrow!
46216,Thanks! Armed with the collective wisdom of Reddit I should be good to go. Happy Halloween!
46217,Happy Halloween!
46218,"When we were growing up, it didn't matter whether the person was nice or not, just if we could get away with TPing a house. Just hope it doesn't rain after midnight."
46219,"Don't give out Dum Dum pops.  I hated every house I went to that gave those out.  All I could think was ""Really?  You couldn't spring for the Tootsie Roll pops?  Maybe the mixed bags of name brand candies?""

I still hate dum dums.  They're just so cheap and awful.  When I want to give an analogy of something cheap and low quality I use Dum Dum pops, so I don't actually have an analogy for them.

**tl;dr: Don't give out Dum Dum pops.**"
46220,Dum Dum are amazing
46221,*Looks around shame-faced* They're my favorite type of lollipop... especially butterscotch.
46222,Wipe that shame off of your face. You're an adult now. Drive to the store and get yourself a bag of delicious dum-dum pops.
46223,"[Drive? This is the future](http://www.candycrate.com/dum-dum-pops-bulk.html).

[And you can always get more!](http://www.spanglercandy.com/candy-store/dum-dum-pops/dum-dum-pops-bulk-lollipops)"
46224,"Nice! I hope there's a kid just like you in my neighborhood, who will come to my house LAST and pick up all the crappy candy no one wants."
46225,I LOVE the mango ones.
46226,"So you're the fucking kid who makes Tootsie pops appear every halloween? 

If I wanted chocolate, I'd get a tootsie roll by itself. Don't make me fucking eat some delicious fruity candy just to have it ruined by the taste of chocolate. Fruit and chocolate sucks."
46227,"Ha ha ok got it. No Dum Dum pops sir.

Do kids just hate lolipops in general or is Dum Dum just the worst of the lot?

Someone gave me some organic sugar cane lolipops lately and they were delicious!"
46228,"Don't listen to him. Tootsie rolls are worse than dum dums. Also, every kid hates Mary Janes."
46229,i had to look up Mary Janes to figure out it was candy. At first i was like who hates weed.
46230,"It's not that people don't like lollipops, hell I love a good one now and then, it's just that dum dum pops are the lowest common denominator of lollipops.  They're small, and they're cheap, and they're just not very good either.

Ah!  Dum Dums are the McDonalds of candy.  There.  I think that works as an analogy."
46231,"When I lived in a neighborhood with some friends from college, we set out a bowl with a sign that says take 1. 

Being the bored college kids we were, we hid in the bushes and around the porch and scared the shit out of any kids who didn't obey the sign.

One kid actually took the entire bowl and probably shit his pants a few moments later."
46232,"Fuck kids in your neighborhood.  I know people who leave buckets out all the time and the kids will take maybe one or two more than they are supposed to, but never the whole bucket."
46233,"When I was younger and went trick or treating, my friends and I once ened up at a house where the person just stuck her hand in a large bag of candy corn and dropped handfuls into each of our bags.

Don't do that. People do not typically want hand-contaminated candies."
46234,Yikes that is kind of gross. Though as a kid I probably would've eaten that candy if my mom wasn't looking. Great tip thanks! I should probably shave and actually put on a clean shirt so I don't scare the parents.
46235,"Haha, if I had been younger than I was at that point in time, it might have been more acceptable! Hey, don't forget to get into the spirit. It's always fun to have someone in costume answer the door, if you're up for it!"
46236,Costumes are a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm more of a watcher. (Wait that sounds creepy).
46237,Not even a nice [gentlemanly costume?](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq4z9wvwUH1qeinago2_250.jpg)
46238,Is that from that Buffy episode where Xander was making the jerking off motion to the girls? Man I love that episode.
46239,Scariest fucking episode ever.
46240,Even just a simple costume will do. Toss on a cape or something.
46241,You can pretty much do anything. Could probably wear a suit and make up some story for it. Kids don't really care now that I think about it… when I was a kid it was all about the candy…
46242,"Ugh, candy corn.  The only food in the world where the candy form tastes worse than the actual version (although I like real corn, and the candy variety in small doses)."
46243,"I'd give a couple pieces per trick or treater. As the night wears on and it's not too busy, I'll give out more, just to get rid of it."
46244,Thanks Pixie--good rule of thumb! I might just polish off the candy as I give them out though....
46245,"if its a super young kid like, under 5, give out just one piece. trust me, the moms don't want to deal with these little kids and a giant bag of candy."
46246,"But if they're awesome parents, they'll do what mine did.

My parents told my brother and me that there was a troll living in our basement, and he requested to hold onto/have some of our Halloween candy as payment for letting us live in the house. After we had a hefty amount of candy Halloween night, we had to hand over the rest. We then had to ask Mom or Dad for some candy, who in turn had to negotiate with the troll. This trick worked for a good amount of time."
46247,"Well, you did

 *Puts on sunglasses* 

get trolled..."
46248,YEAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
46249,Doing this will risk the wrath of a parent defending their little snowflake.
46250,"Oh, hey. Some towns put specific limits on the end of trick-or-treating. My town says 7 o'clock. We used to trick-or-treat from 3 pm all the way to nine, if we could."
46251,"""Get rid of it?"" You're a sick individual."
46252,"I felt the urge to post something in the same vein, but you already put so it so much more concise and beautiful than I would have ever been able to."
46254,Great tips thank you so much! It would be awesome if only 2 kids came to my door. I'm going to have the biggest sugar binge ever if that happens.
46255,"As far as how much candy to give out, when I was a kid it changed from house to house from one piece (which I was fine with especially if it was the good stuff) to whole HANDFULS. Usually the handfuls of candy came from the last houses I went to in my neighborhood who were trying not to get stuck with most of a bowl of candy. 

So if you don't know how many kids are going to show up start out with one piece per kid to be safe and then later in the night when it looks like you might get stuck with 200 pieces of candy start handing out more."
46256,">5: You don't have to stand by the door,

Do it, that'll make it extra creepy. Also keep your candy in the basement, in a bowl that is glued to the ground. Ask the kids to join you and get their candy."
46257,"> Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

I let the kids pick. It sucks when you're a kid and someone drops the **wrong one** into the loot sack. Also, this way I can tell the nice kids from the little shits, which might be useful information someday. Nice kids tentatively pick their one favorite, the little bastards grab a pudgy mittfull and run.

> What happens do I run out of candy?

Turn off the lights and close the door."
46258,"> I let the kids pick.

Fuck that. I bought it and I'm a busy man. I slam that shit in the bag. Boom! You feel that? That was a full size son. Now get off my porch."
46259,">this way I can tell the nice kids from the little shits

Sir I like the way you think. :p"
