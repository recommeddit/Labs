61924,"It's a victim of the series own success, not nearly as good as the original trilogy.

It's fun as hell but the story and script are mostly disappointing."
61925,"As someone who hasn't played the original trilogy, it upsets me to hear Andromeda pales in comparison to its predecessors, especially in regard to its story.  Nevertheless, I'll eventually buy the game."
61926,"You are really better of with Mass effect 1+2. Mass effect 3 wasnt that good btw, not bad though. This new Mass Effect shouldnt even be called Mass Effect"
61927,"Kingdom Hearts 2 (from 1.5+2.5 collection)
FFXV
Persona 5
Bloodborne 
Skyrim

Honorable Mention: Witcher 3"
61928,"Persona 5
Witcher 3
Bloodborne
yakuza 0
Horizon"
61929,"Witcher 3, witcher 3, witcher 3, witcher 3 and witcher 3"
61930,"1. Witcher 3

2. Persona 5

3. Final Fantasy XV

4. Dragon Age Inquisition

5. Fallout 4 tied with Horizon ZD"
61931,"Witcher 3 

Persona 5

Fallout 4 

Tales of berseria 

Skyrim"
61932,"Divinity Original Sin 1 and especially 2

Nier Automata

Persona 5

Dragon Quest XI"
61934,Divinity Original Sin 2
61935,"Persona 5 is incredible and will keep you busy for MONTHS honestly...
Tales of Berseria is a very good JRPG.

Nier: Automata

Dragon Age Inquisition

YS VIII"
61936,Persona 5 and maybe persona 5 also uhh... persona 5 :)
61937,"Can't recommend this enough. I hate anime, I hate cringey teenage stories where adults=bad and I'm not a fan of JRPGs in general.

So why the fuck can't I stop playing the game for the past 3 weeks?"
61938,Dragon Quest 11 for sure. It’s a throwback to the old school turn based RPGs so it’s a lot of fun and very wholesome with a lot of charm.
61939,I'm trying to rush through my current game so I can play this one. Love the look.
61940,I’m really enjoying both South Park games.
61941,"Just another person recommending Persona 5. It's turn based, just a fair warning, but it provides great character development, music, story, setting. 

My friend who doesn't like RPGs and loved Dark Souls/Bloodborne, is really enjoying this game."
61943,"Hey, be mindful of spoilers man."
61944,"You're right, wasn't thinking. Couldn't figure out how to add spoiler tags, so I just deleted it."
61945,"No worries man, I will say finding a romantic option in this game is fun as hell."
61946,"I absolutely loved playing it, even had full Excel sheets with fusions and learned skills.  I had planned my team out for endgame, and made it to November, and then I got distracted.  Needed a break (after 120 hours, I was getting burned out), and then I never went back to it.  

I had gotten the PS3 version, because I didn't think I'd ever get a PS4, but now that I do have one, I really don't want to haul the old system back out just to play one or two games.  On the other hand, not too enthused about buying P5 on the new console and starting from scratch, either."
61947,"That's a shame. I can tell you that me and my friends have played through it twice, but the second time was new game plus which makes it different. 

I can also tell you that you still had a lot of game and story to get through! I'm sad that you may not ever complete it. The last few missions are Soo good story wise."
61948,"Off the top of my head:

Persona 5
Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Assassins Creed Odyssey
Bloodborne
Horizon Zero Dawn (long action game that has RPG elements)"
61949,"* The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Sword & magic)
* Persona 5
* Tales of Berseria
* Transistor
* Child of Light (Sword & magic)"
61950,"Will check those
Thanks"
61951,"I will always recommend Tales of Berseria. My personal favorite of the series, with an excellent cast of characters and a well-refined battle system. Lots of fun to play through co-op with a friend. Thought the story did enough differently to give the series a breath of fresh air, so it's a bummer that it seems to have been a bit overlooked."
61953,"Witcher 3,
Never played it but persona 5 gets a lot of positive reviews,
Dragon age inquisition"
61954,"Oh right, forgot to mention
Got Witcher 3 bundle really cheap on Steam, but I'm not in home until 1 more month so I prefer to wait for it 

Gonna check P5."
61955,Dragon age Inquisition is really good too. A bit dated now though
61956,"I think I played one before, but I'm not sure if you can manage the party equipment + skills

Correct me if I'm mistaken please"
61957,You can.
61958,Worst disappointment of my gaming life. Terribly mediocre game.
61959,"I know I'm late to the party but I do hope you checked out Persona 5.  I don't like turn based RPGs, and I'm not a huge anime fan... but Persona 5 is easily one of my favorite games of all time.   and it has a solid 5 star rating with 12k votes on the PlayStation store... that's the highest I've ever seen of any game, period."
61960,"Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.

Assassin's Creed Origins & Odyssey are action games with many RPG elements."
61961,I would argue that AC Odyssey is a pure (and very decent) rpg in the vein of Witcher 3.
61962,"Dark Souls Remastered. I never originally played it on PS3. I absolutely loved it. 

Nioh is one of my favourites. DS style but in Japan, can't go wrong 

Nier Automata was a really well made game and has a very unique style. Music was awesome as well"
61963,"I already ""plat"" DSI on pc, the only remaster I will hope to is Demon Souls 

Is NieR customizable? I thought you could only play with the same character always"
61964,"Nier has different weapons to use and has stats to level up. You stay as the same character for most of the game (switches for story parts to another one) you can't customize the characters like in Dark Souls. The story, feel, and gameplay are amazing. 

For something just like the SoulsBorne games there really is only Nioh which is fantastic. 

Diablo 3 is another option as well for top down rpg style and you have lots of loot, gear and weapons."
61965,Absolutely agree with Nioh! It's such a gem!
61966,"If you are looking for sword and Magic RPG's, I think you will like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Quest 11"
61967,"I have witcher for PC, just can't play it now
I will search about DQXI"
61969,"Kingdom Hearts 

Rogue Galaxy

Horizon Zero Dawn

Assassins Creed Odyssey

If you like ""Grindy"" co-op...check out the Save the World portion of Fortnite"
61970,Dragon age inquisition
61971,Just sunk 110 hours into Dragon Age Inquisition and have not finished the base game yet but I'm a side quester. I loved the Witcher 3 and heard it ruined DA:I but I have really enjoyed it.
61972,The Egyptian or Greek Assassins creed. The combat reminded me of Dark Souls
61973,"You played Shadow of Mordor, have you played the sequel?"
61974,Now that you mention it... no
61975,"It's more of the same and improved. So if you liked the first one, you'll probably really like Shadow of War."
61976,"The first one was the first game I enjoyed that much that I plat'ed it
I think I may get SoW"
61977,"I loved it. The Game of the year edition is out now, so you get the game and all the dlc with it."
61978,"Most already mentioned but Tales of Berseria, P5, Witcher 3, Neir Automata, and Dragon Age: Inq are all great games. 

DA:I scratched the RPG itch the most after Witcher"
61979,Dragon's Dogma. Good variety of fantasy creatures/monsters to fight and some of the funnest combat in any game I have played.
61980,"Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Nioh"
61981,DS and BB already plat. Nioh will try
61982,"Ah I somehow missed you mentioning them in your post lol

I'm an idiot soz"
61983,"Never played it and it might not be a 100% RPG, but I've heard good things about yakuza"
61984,"Nier Autamata, Nioh and Dtagon Quest Xi are my faves."
61985,Monster Hunter World and Ni No Kuni II. Very enjoyable games that provide countless hours of fun.
61986,"Darksiders 1 and 2!  I really liked 1 but LOVED 2.  It’s not a popular opinion but 2 was so outstanding for me.  One of the few games were I went for every trophy and a few that were 1.1% Ultra rare are my favorite trophies earned!

I had an absolute blast with 1 and 2 and I can’t wIt for 3!"
61987,Recommend to play both or should I just jump on the 2?
61988,"I found them both great fun, but I enjoyed 2 more because of the extra way weapons were handled and armor.  You got to get loot with stats/buffs that changed your appearance and were meaningful with stats.

I liked being able to switch between weapon styles to change my play style.

I preferred 2 but both games are great fun."
61989,The witcher 3 is such a underrated gem and probably the best game of this generation
61990,I agree it's great but it's one of the most mentioned games on Reddit.
61991,No shit sherlock. Shouldve put an /s to that but i thought its so obvious i dont need to.
61993,Its so underrated bro. Literally have never ever seen anyone mentioning it in any conversation ever. Rise up fellow gamer
61994,PREY is so fun it’s like if Bethesda made Bioshock
61995,"For some reason I found it to be really tough, even on easy mode"
61996,Mass Effect. Legendary Edition gets you 3 games for the price of one and it has excellent replayability.
61997,I concur
61998,"Newcomer to the series here. I just bought the legendary edition and am struggling to push forward due to constantly getting lost and wandering dead ends on the map. Any advice? 

Also the combat is clunky af, game has not aged great."
61999,"Dude yeah, that's honestly just a problem with the first one. I'm having the same problem trying to slog through it and just keep putting it aside."
62000,"The first one has that issue, yeah. My advice would be to just find a non-spoiler guide for the main questline. The combat in 2 and 3 is much more polished and overall tighter and I loved it. But 1 does get annoying at times."
62001,Witcher 3 is must play
62002,Vouch. It's a must.
62003,"Best quests in an rpg I've ever played. Even the side quests felt like main content. I platinum'ed the base game, but I hear that the dlcs are amazing as well. Would definitely put W3 as my top suggestion to anyone."
62004,"Dude I recommend revisiting it for the dlcs at some point, they are great"
62005,Just got it for the same reasons as OP. Im looking forward to it.
62006,"Will concede it is a great game, but I tried 3 times and just could not get into it. Loved the second one though."
62007,That’s totally fair! But I do feel the majority tend to enjoy it so it’s a pretty safe rec
62008,"Oh 110% I am in the vast minority haha like I said, it was an incredibly well made game, and I really wanted to, and should have, liked it. Just didn't get it's hooks into me"
62009,I was the same. I think it took me something like 4 attempts to actually stick to it. The first three tries I made it to the end of white orchard but just wasn't interested. The 4th though was incredibly boring during white orchard but I pushed through it and once I got to the barons quest line I was hooked and couldn't put it down. I've completed the game 3 times now and two of those with all the dlc content. The blood and wine dlc is a must and is simply amazing.
62010,"The Netflix series also worked for me as a good introduction to the world, tried it before but couldn't get into it, after watching the show with a better understanding of the world and characters the game clicked for me."
62011,"That's my concern with trying it.  I tried to watch the Netflix series and couldn't get into it at all, so I figure I might not like the game either"
62012,"If you’re a Bethesda RPG fan, I think you’ll like Outer Worlds"
62013,"This game feels like a proper successor to Fallout, just in space and not so buggy. It is a good time."
62014,"Heard of it, just haven’t taken a look at it yet but I will"
62015,I absolutely loved it.
62016,The best RPG ever.
62017,I heard it's super boring though.
62018,It's really good but fairly short and not very deep
62019,"Probably someone who has never played it. If you want an immersive experience then go for it. The whole saga is heart wrenching, exciting and intriguing."
62020,"For sure, I'll pick it up once the complete edition is announced lol 40 is too steep for me rn. Especially with my damn backlog."
62021,"Witcher 3, Dragon Age(s), Bloodborne (and Soul friends), and perhaps Kingdom Come Deliverance. plus Ghost of Tsushima."
62022,"Bloodborne! Doing my 3rd playthrough atm. Such a masterpiece. Wish I could get into Witcher 3, but after bloodborne, every other game feels clunky in the fight mechanics"
62024,"Here is the problem with Witcher. You must understand the books. Even the first game
carries on after 7th book. To a person who did not read books or not play previous games 3rd title's story might be confusing"
62026,"Major Points about most characters are not explained in the game. For instance : Who is Avalach and why does he have a beef with Eredin? What is Wild Hunt and why do they want Ciri so hella much ? Relationship of Yennefer and Geralt? Ciri's bloodline and lineage? 

Those points are hella important to understand the story yet games do not explain it but books does . Games do expand the book's story thus makes it hard to understand for only game fans"
62027,"Try FF7 Remake, it’s active combat vs turn based like most FFs, and is overall great graphics, vibe, and story wise. I think you can play the first chapter as a demo"
62028,Kingdom Come deliverance is a good one i just got it a month ago.  Very enjoyable game
62029,This although loading times are terrible.
62030,"Also many bugs, awful combat mechanics."
62031,"Hard disagree on the combat mechanics. The system encourages you to think about your fights and not blindly rush in. The game is seated in realism and the difficult (until you've learned enough *in game*) combat really hammer home how frantic and dangerous a sword fight is.

Don't look at Kingdom Come like Skyrim - look at it as a medieval life simulator and you'll enjoy it way more."
62032,You literally just made me put it to re download.
62033,Hope you enjoy! WorthABuy’s review of the game really put me in the right headspace for it. You’ve got to live Henry’s life because you’re an idiot blacksmith’s apprentice - you literally don’t know how to do anything and the game is about that competence-creep and slowly getting better at these really dangerous things.
62034,No bugs yet for me and the combat does take time getting use to but i found it to very immersing.
62035,"I remember the combat being pretty solid once you get the hang of it, and train your skills up. At the beginning it feels clunky but you just need to level up and practice"
62036,"Can’t second this enough. You want to feel immersed in a world, this is it. They took so much care into every little aspect of the world and gameplay in this one. Loved it."
62037,"Disgaea, Ni no Kuni 2 was cool for awhile but I couldn't finish it."
62038,"Disgaea is a fantastic series untill the later games. The direct sequel to the original one on ps4 is probably the best one. After 3 they had too much anime shit for me, but the gameplay is still top notch. I dunno if op would enjoy them since they are srpgs"
62039,"Not sure what counts as an RPG, but I highly recommend the Uncharted series. Fantastic gameplay, fantastic storytelling. Tomb Raider is another series similar to Uncharted.

And The Last of Us 1 and 2 are the best games I've ever played."
62040,"Kind of throwing it out there but I didn't see it mentioned: Monster Hunter World.

It took me a while to learn the basics but it's now one of the few games I've played for over 100 hours."
62041,"I tried that and enjoyed it but didn't really see that there was much to the game: find monster, kill it, get some xp and gear, go back to town, restock and then go back out and kill another monster.

I've played it for about 5hrs so I wonder if the game opens up any more later on. What is it that brings you back to it?"
62042,"It's about incremental gains. You farm one monster to build a set of armor that will enable you to get a kill on a more challenging monster and gain access to its armor set.

Then you mix and match armor and gems in order to put together a ""build"" that will allow you to tack the end game monsters."
62043,I absolutely loved MHW and agree with you on the gameplay loop and mechanics of the game. I feel that's what made it such a good game. My only issue  now is that I want to get back into it but there's just so much complexity to the inventory system and learning the core mechanics again just feels too overwhelming and I just can't get back into it.
62044,"To me, it's the Diablo style gameplay loop that brings you back,+ Soulsbourne style combat / boss fights (though significantly easier) where you have to learn the attack patterns to succeed. Add in that each weapon plays entirely differently and that's a ton of hours"
62045,"Persona 5.

Trust me as someone that never played a previous Persona game and couldn't even stand a single SMT game after Digital Devil Saga, it is by far one of the craziest most in depth and long term enjoyable RPG games I've played in the past 2 decades."
62046,And Persona 5 Royal is just amazing.
62047,The only game to ever make me actually like going to school 😂
62048,"I would consider those action adventures game with super basic rpg elements. 

So do you want open world games with basic rpg elements or actual rpg games. Like ff, nier, ni no kuni, tales series, persona, etc."
62089,"Ghost of Tsushima for sure. 
Immortals Fenyx Rising is also a pretty decent game."
62050,"These are both in my top 10 of best games I ever played, great suggestions. You might also like Nier Automata and Sekiro"
62051,Fenyx for whatever reason took me a little bit to get into. Like I had to try to get into the game but I'm glad I finally did because it's been awesome so far. (I'm prob a little more than half way through it) And I've been told before to try out Nier so maybe I should at some point lol.
62052,"Ni No Kuni series, Tales Of series, The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Of Cold Steel series and of course Final Fantasy!"
62053,"From the sound of it OP is a stranger to Japanese games and JRPGs. I second these suggestions, but for people that have only played western games, it might be quite a shock to the system."
62054,"Seriously tales of berseria should be pretty cheap these days, and I think its got the best combat in the series."
62055,"I played it for hours! But after 2-3 days of not playing, i got bored and found it to be stupidly repetitive =/ Go to a zone, get the items, kill the boss, new zone, more items, new zone, more items... And each item has a different ability, so getting them all is really boring after a while =/"
62056,"Any of the most recent Assassin's Creed games (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla), Witcher 3, and the Watchdogs games."
62057,I wouldn't say Valhalla though it seemed kind of too much
62058,"It's definitely the weakest of the three. I *loved* Origins, really enjoyed Odyssey, and am just kind of playing through Valhalla to get it finished."
62059,Ghost of Tsushima? I enjoyed that game cleared it at least 2 times in my spare time
62060,Play god of war. Immerse yourself in it. You will love it
62061,"Gotta recommend Bloodborne, dark souls series, immortal Phoenix rising, ac origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. And finally little nightmares 1 & 2."
62062,Path of Exile
62063,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was recently rereleased.
62064,Metro Exodus
62065,Dragon Age is a very good series.
62066,"Cowboy Simulator 2. No, wait. Red Dead Redemption 2. Sorry"
62067,*Cowboy Dress-up Simulator 2.
62068,"Actually I’ve beat that, guess that would’ve been something to add"
62069,Nice. Dragons Age? Witcher? Dragons Quest 11?
62070,"I’ll have to take a look, thanks for the suggestions!"
62071,"I second Dragon Quest 11. If you like classic, turn-based JRPGs, it is one if the best!"
62072,"I tried so hard to get into dragon quest 11 but I just couldn't, it bored me to hell lol"
62073,"I hate to be the guy that says, give it X amount of hours lol but it took me just over 15 hours for it to click. After that, I fell in love with the series as a whole."
62074,How in the fuck is Tomb Raider a rpg  it's a Adventure game   I would try  Dragon Quest 11 and Shin Megami
62075,"Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made. Nothing else from this generation even comes close. Except for the legendary edition of mass effect if you wanna count that. Both of those are absolute must plays, light-years ahead of half the games you listed. You won't regret it"
62076,"scarlet nexus? it's more like a hack and slash than an rpg but it does have a lot of rpg mechanics in it, if you like dmc or spiderman i think you can get a kick out of it"
62077,"Sorry to be that guy but i think calling most of these (besides Skyrim and Fallout) games RPG's is really pushing it.


Imho the rest should much rather be called action adventure.


Anywho you already have some nice suggestions, if you want to try something different and more ""classic"" RPG-like, i would recommend Divinity Original Sin II"
62078,Both of the Last Of Us have awesome stories.
62079,You tried any of the Assasins Creed games?
62080,"No, but I have looked into them, are they any good?"
62081,I'd go for odyssey. It's one of the better ones with rpg elements. Reminds me of the witcher without the fantastic story
62082,"I’ll definitely have to try it, also is the Witcher any fun?"
62083,If you haven’t tried it yet it’s one of the best choices for you
62084,I really enjoyed the story. But after initially beating it and getting back to it a couple years later the controls felt very dated. But that might not be the case for you.  It's a great game. And most likely very cheap. And the dlc is actually worth it. It's a little harder than your average rpg but not souls like. You just have to prepare
62085,"Ive played every game and while the older ones were quite repetitive, the newer ones are much better.

I love the aspect of consistency with history in the games so i really enjoy them"
62086,Dragons Dogma is an underground hit. It’s got its jank but it’s one of my all time favorites. The souls series is a good option if you’re looking for something a little challenging
62087,"Would love to see a remake or a sequel to this game but yes very good rpg.

Another rpg I would love a remake to is legend of dragoon"
62088,If you're in the mood for something completely different check out Zanki Zero. It's a grid based dungeon crawler with some survival elements (which can be turned off) and a WILD story.
62090,"AC Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla (origins my favourite)

Witcher 3

Dark Souls 3

Bloodborne

Sekiro

Deaths Door"
62091,Shadow of Mordor was quite fun for me
62092,Mass effect series is the must of all musts for me. (Not andromeda)
62093,"You can give assassins creed odyssey a try, not as in-depth as most RPGs but still fun nonetheless."
62094,So I'll give you something different than what's being recommended in this thread. How about 'Dragon Ball Z : Kakarot'? It's a retelling of the dbz anime and is an open world rpg. Its a great fun game imo if you want something different.
62096,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Persona 5 Royal, the most recent Assassin Creed entries (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla), Ghost of Tsushima, Code Vein, Days Gone, Darksiders 1&2, and the Mass Effect trilogy remaster."
62097,Dark souls 3. Have fun. Not exactly the same but you will enjoy yourself
62098,"Nioh! Nioh 2 is all right, but the first one is absolutely amazing for combat mechanics. If the game seems too hard for you at first, level up magic. But please try to play through the game without using sloth talismans, it makes the bosses a LOT easier than the developers intended."
62099,Bloodborne.
62100,Darks Souls 3 or Bloodborn!
62101,"Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2, Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2, Wasteland 2 and 3, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered and 4, Path of Exile — those are some of my favorite RPGs and I haven’t seen anyone else mention them yet"
62102,Divinity 2 swallowed my soul for 130 hours.
62103,One of my favorites. Have you played wasteland 3 after all like 11 of the big patches to make it playable?
62104,It's in my library but I haven't gotten into it yet. I'm in the middle of Pillars of Eternity 2 but the loading screens are really ruining it.
62105,Really wanted this game but even now apparently it's still unplayable on playstation. Pathfinder kingmaker is a great game despite a crash here and there. Load screens are almost nonexistent on the ps5. It's like dos2 and bg2 had a bastard child. Story is OK but combat and optional tb/rtwp elements are well done for console
62106,"For RPG’s, I would highly recommend The Witcher 3. Not everyone’s cup of tea but give it a couple of hours and you will feel the immersion. It will however take a lot of your time.
For JRPG’s, there are plenty starting off with Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Persona 5, Star Ocean, and Tales of."
62107,Saw that you haven't played The Witcher 3. Definitely going to be your best bet for a good RPG. Although there's plenty of others out there. AC: Odyssey is enjoyable. Story is a bit lackluster but the gameplay was right there.
62108,Dark souls! Do it now! Start with first one (dark souls remastered)
62109,Dark Souls
62110,"If you like shooting then Borderlands. It’s so so amazing and other than BL3, you can get all refinements and DLCs with previous BL games. The correct order of playing is BL1 > The Pre Sequel > BL2 > BL3. BL1 is a little off putting because it’s the oldest (there’s a remaster available) but it shows it’s age. It got on me after couple of hours and I didn’t want to stop playing it and the other parts. Hours and hours of running and shooting around the open world and finding loot.

Edit: not that BL3 is any bad. It’s the best of the series imo. But there are 2 season passes. One is for DLC campaign and the other for extra content. I’ve yet to check them out."
62111,You’re forgetting the best rpg games available on PlayStation. Dark souls 1-3 and bloodborne.
62112,"Try ghost of tsushima, ac origins, odissey or if you more into the more rpg elements of the two even valhalla"
62113,"Witcher 3, Mass Effect 2, Dark Souls, 1 and 3, Red Dead Redemption 1. Could pay those games until the end of time."
62114,I'm playing God of War right now and I am THOUROUGHLY enjoying it
62115,Terraria
62116,"Get a SNES emulator and fire up Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, or Secret of Mana! All classics"
62117,"Since you like playing Skyrim so much and enjoy Fallout 4 too, i think The Outer Worlds will be right up your alley ! The team behind it is the one who makes Fallout New Vegas."
62118,Witcher 3!
62119,Divinity Original Sin 2?
62120,I'm gonna throw in red dead redemption 2 cos no one had mentioned it
62122,Divinity Original Sin II
62123,Try mount and blade. Not quite what you asked. But fun
62124,Days Gone is awesome zombie survival game
62125,Kingdoms of Amalur is an amazing game
62126,"If u would like to try something different, a mix of sidescroling hack n slash/Jrpg/tactical game, Odin Sphere. Amazing little gem."
62127,"In case you don't like JRPG's, might I suggest Days Gone?"
62128,"Your list is mostly action adventure games. As for rpgs, I picked up Divinity: Original Sin 2 on sale, just to try something different. Wound up playing 130 hours. Use the sales to experiment with stuff you wouldn't normal play. You never know."
62129,"i strongly recommend dragon age: inquisition if you haven't played yet. it has lots of similarities with skyrim but with better gameplay and graphics. story is a mega banger too.
and if you are up for the challenge or rather change in gaming style definitely play bloodborne and dark souls 3.
and there is nioh1 and 2 which are the best souls clone games. 
recently I've played divinity: original sin2 and although it's painfully slow at first few hours but definitely on of the best rpg games ever made."
62130,You should play dishonored if you haven’t beat it yet i loved that game….play all of them
62131,"Try Jedi fallen order, great game"
62132,You should try Days Gone. Takes a couple hours to get going but the story is one of the best I’ve ever experienced in video games
62133,The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. It’s just awesome
62134,Vampyr is a good game. Have u tried?
62135,Here's an oldie but a goodie - Infamous: Second Son
62136,I just picked up ghost of tuishima and can’t put it down. Meets your reps and I think better than god of war.
62137,"Star wars jedi fallen order, or FF15"

62141,Do you like jrpg’s?
62142,Tales of Arise comes out Friday.
62143,id strongly suggest the Disgaea series if you're into tactical RPGs well over 100+ hours of gameplay and customization there
62144,"If you’re really into RPGs, you should probabaly get a series x and Gamepass. Microsoft pretty much has all of the western RPG makers now"
62145,"Has to be the Witcher 3, surely?!?! Combat isn’t the best compared to something like God of War, but alongside RDR2 the best story/voice acting of any game i’ve ever played.

Ghost of Tsushima also a fun one to play through."
62146,Yakuza series - super entertaining and a bajillion hours long.
62147,"Yakuza Like a Dragon or Dragon Quest XI are among my favorite games of all time, amazing RPG's."
62148,"If you don't mind japanese RPGs but made for the western audience anyways, I'll suggest you to play Persona 5 Royal and Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Just 2 of my favorites in the last couple of years."
62149,Dragons Dogma and Persona 5
62150,Nier Automata.  The only game I’ve 100%’ed.
62151,I’ve played the beginning of a game called “Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch” it’s an RPG made in part with Studio Ghibi (if I’m not mistaken). It really gives you The studio Ghibi vibes from the hand drawn animated cutscenes and story. I’ve been looking for a copy for myself for sometime
62152,"Honestly, FFXV is pretty unique as a FF game.  Finally, it feels quite different from all their other games (in a good way).  The game has some flaws but don’t let that get in the way of it.

Also, Final Fantasy 14 just greatly expanded their free trial to include the whole base game + the first expansion Heavensward.  This is SOO MUCH content for free.  I started up and am in the in-between period the end of the base game and Heavensward (and there’s a ridiculous amount of content at this part alone).  It’s quite the experience and it is SUPER single player friendly.  They do a good job easing you into the experience and the multiplayer aspects.  It’s been a lot of fun so far (and only getting better and more in-depth)."
62153,Trail cold steel series and you could add octopath if you talking pc
62154,I played all trials of cold steel as well ✌️
62155,Haven't played it myself but someone in my friend list told me to try dragon star varnir i'll probably do it later as i'm about to start tales of vesperia very soon maybe you can take a look a that as well heard good things about it.
62156,"If you liked Berseria, then Tales of Vesperia and Zestiria (Zest is related to Berseria and neat to find how it links)

62160,**Final Fantasy XII**: The **Zodiac Age**
62161,Digimon Story series. Very underrated JRPG series.
62162,"Resonance of Fate. 
*drops mic*"
62163,Trails in the sky trilogy
62164,"Definitely Nier Automata if you haven't, and haven't played Final Fantasy 7 Remake but heard some good things about it !"
62165,Oh I almost forgot. I played those two. FF7 still left incomplete. I can't get excited from it 🤔
62166,"Ayee, looks like I should be asking you what I should play! I'm currently on FFX and I'm thinking of playing Persona5 after. Have you played any Devil May Cry games?"
62167,You should play Devil May cry 5 or wait for the special edition. It's more like action driven then story driven. Not my cup of tea l.
62168,Also play Royal version of persona 5
62169,The Tales Series and FFXV are two of my current favorites. I’ve sunk over 250 hours into FFXV alone. It does get linear for a bit at the end but you can use a special thing to go back to the open world at nearly any time.
62171,"I thoroughly hated FF15. It had a lot going for it but I felt like it shot itself in the foot in too many ways.

It’s just a hate it or love it game. 

Glad you were the latter."
62172,">felt like it shot itself in the foot in too many ways

This is exactly how I felt as well. Literally everything great that the game does is ruined somehow sooner or later. Bosses are epic as fuck but fighting them is awful. (especially >!leviathan in chapter 8, it looked so fucking epic but all I did was hold down the attack button.!<) The world is beautiful but boring. The story is interesting but half of it is missing... I was so frustrated by the time I was done with the game because it had so much potential."
62173,I couldn’t agree more except that I got too frustrated that I couldn’t finish around chapter 11 or so (where you’re stuck in that stupid factory steathing around.
62174,"Ughh, that part sucked so much. Camera was so much more difficult than any enemy encountered in the whole damned zone. And again, the idea of >!having noct alone and without access to his powers was great but the execution was fucking terrible!<. You honestly didn't miss much as I hated everything after that gameplay-wise and was left confused story-wise so good call and giving up."
62175,"Red Dead Redemption 2

Its the best looking and most immersive open-world game I've ever played. It has some dark parts and creepy random encounters. The controls are clunky but you can do a lot with them. Getting proficient with them gives a sense of accomplishment. The game may be slow paced in a lot of parts, but it fits the setting."
62176,"Can’t believe I forgot about Red dead, thank you"
62177,"Just to give you an idea of how creepy it can be. It's worth mentioning that I'm on my second playthrough, and I still find encounters I had never seen before. Story time.

So I'm riding my all black American standard through the swamp lands, there's a heavy fog as night draws in. I cross a narrow wooden bridge and my horse gets spooked and throws me. As I stand up I see a dead horse in an old wagon. the fog is so thick and I'm calling for my horse but it isn't coming, so I knew something had went wrong. I draw my pistol expecting the worst. When I find my horse there's a creepy looking man standing by her so I line up my shot and peel his cap back. As I do, I notice a red Dot on my map, another guy tackles me to the ground. Luckily I break free and finish him off. Get on my horse and away I went. 

Sorry for the text wall. This is one of the only games where I can just be playing normally and something random happens that I'd never expect. Absolutely recommend."
62178,You made the game sound so real! I imagine RDR2 to be the closest thing we have today to a Westworld kind of experience. But I have so many games on my backlog!
62179,"The thing about RDR2 is you need to dedicate time to playing it.  So while I want to tell you this game should be next on your list, unless you can dedicate a couple of days within a weeks' time to it, it's not worth it.  The game play is so immersive and the controls are a little clunky that if you don't grind some quests and get into a little exploring while also getting the hang of the mechanics it can be frustrating to come back to.

That being said it's been my favorite game since GTA V and TLoU.  I think it took me personally 20 hours to go from somewhat enjoying the atmosphere and gameplay to falling in love with the game.  My observations on needing to dedicate the time are in regards to my friends who never seemed to like it.  They're also the ones who bounce around and play multiple games during their gaming sessions.  As you progress through the chapters I feel like gameplay develops and more mechanics open themselves up to you.  Even through 1/2 of the story you're still being taught new mechanics to make the gameplay better."
62180,"Oh I agree 100%, I've met people who absolutely hated it but, they only played chapter two and then stopped. OP, this game has an amazing story aspect. I won't spoil anything but it's awe inspiring how well it's put together. I do agree though, you need to spend quite a bit of time with it."
62181,"Put it this way, I have about 15 or so games in my log and I cleared it for a second playthrough of this game."
62182,"Just be aware the gameplay can be really frustrating and clunky. Story and graphics are great, but it's not fun as other RPG's generally are."
62183,"I've never understood how it's not fun. I had way more fun playing this than 95% of the RPGs out there. At least it's not full of grinding, bullet sponges, pointless/soulless dialogue, and clearing enemy camps. I'll take RDR2 to boring formula of most other ARPGs. To each his own, I guess."
62184,"Yeah, I disagree. I'll admit that it lacks the replayability of an rpg, but it is definitely fun. People often times equate arcady games to fun and realistic games as slow or boring. I would argue that I haven't had more fun playing a game than when I played Red Dead."
62185,"I hear a lot of people complaining about the controls but they're not bad imo. The game is more cinematic so the game is heavily animation based compared to something like Bloodborne. So I don't think it's that there is anything wrong with the controls, moreso the designers decided to make the game as realistic as possible."
62186,Witcher 3 all day long
62187,"And the day after that, and the day after that (my Death March playthrough is currently at 43 hours and I feel like I'm speeding through it!)"
62188,"And it’s cirrently $15 for the GotY on PSN, which is a good deal"
62189,"I've said this before and I'll keep saying it, for $15 you get the game and 16 DLC. It's the best bang for buck ratio in a long long time."
62190,"Good story, fantastic world, worst combat this gen."
62191,">Good story, fantastic world, worst combat this gen.

I love this game, but I can't really disagree with the people who complain about the combat.  Even if the combat was strictly vanilla it wold be better than some of the mechanics they introduced.  I made an alchemy build, and it's frustrating as hell to micromanage all of your oils.  How hard would it have been to have the oils that you've unlocked to automatically apply to Geralt's swords against the relevant monsters/npcs he was fighting?"
62192,If you like darker game with a good story line you could check out a game called vampyre.
62193,What’s this like? Any similarity to the old vampire masquerade game?
62194,Not sure as I’ve never played it but your a doctor who has been turned into a vampire by someone and your trying to find out who that is while also trying to understand vampirism as a disease and it’s all about should you feed on people or not as you will become stronger by feeding on npcs but it can have an effect on the area around them and other characters. You also start learning about the vampiric society in London where the games based.
62195,New vamp masquerade game coming next year btw
62196,"I second Witcher if you haven't played it. For what it's worth I certainly had fun with Odyssey but I think I like Origins more, Egypt is an awesome setting for a game. If you're looking for more of a hardcore RPG, Divinity: Original I and II are fantastic games with great stories, just do some research and make sure it's the kind of game you'd enjoy. Dragon Age: Inquisition is pretty good and seems up your alley."
62197,Adding Witcher to my list and Origins. I appreciate your thoughtful reply!
62198,The witcher 3 is a masterpiece.
62199,Mad jelly that you get to experience The Witcher 3 for the first time -- the game is very deserving of all the critical acclaim that surrounds it.
62200,Origins in my opinion also has a really good story for an AC game. i can recommend this game as well.
62201,"I felt like the story kinda felt apart a bit towards the end. It started off really strong but lost some momentum and felt a bit rushed towards the end. 

The whole story arc with The Scarab was one of my favourite parts of any AC game ever though."
62202,"Well it's an mmo but ffxiv has been amazing since ARR.
Not sure how well it plays on console but since it has crossplay it can't be all bad. The story takes a while to pick up but it's amazing through and through. Even the latest expansion, while the weakest of the bunch, manages to deliver some of the finest rpg storyline in recent memory.

Obvious witcher 3 also. Not once was I bored with the game and when I quit it wasn't out of boredom. After the expansions and 100% achievements unlocked on steam, I just felt like I had my fill. It's amazing to be able to put a game to rest, not due to boredom but due to you just feeling so content and full that you feel like it's time to move on."
62204,"Theres....A LOT of quests in the main storyline, which is something you have to go through to unlock aspects and mechanics of the game. When I say a lot..I mean hundreds, literally hundreds (300+ I think?). It's a slow burn for like the first 1/3 or so until the story gets good at the first expansion. If you can march through that first section, it's worth it.

I've heard they are working on streamlining the experience but not sure when it's supposed to be implemented."
62205,"Have you played any of the final fantasy series? Theres a reason its one of the most popular rpg series. You should check them out if you arent against turn based combat. Also check out yakuza 0, if you end up liking it there are like 7 more games in the series you might love."
62206,Which one would you recommend?
62207,"If you really want an open world game you could go with final fantasy xv. It also has real time action combat. The game has quite a few problems but despite them its still a super enjoyable game with a ton of stuff to do. 

Final fantasy X is one of the older style games with turn based combat and it was the first ff game with voice acting. The story and the world are amazing. It is quite linear though, but that isnt a negative in my opinion. Many consider it one of the best in the franchise.

Final fantasy IX is also considered one of the best by many fans. The story is great, the music is great. It has a pretty large world. One common complaint is that the combat is really slow, so that might turn some people away.

Anyway you could always check out reviews or watch some gameplay to see which one is for you."
62208,Final Fantasy VIII. The remaster is coming on Tuesday on ps4. My favorite videogame of all times.
62209,"Odyssey, Witcher 3, Spider-Man, Days Gone, honestly you can't really go wrong with most open world RPG's."
62210,"i wouldnt call spider man or days gone rpgs, though"
62211,"According to Australia, Detroit is an RPG. 

I’d say they fit the definition well enough."
62212,"RPG has broadened its meaning lately so of you can customise a character with stats, outfits, weapons and that kind of thing then it's usually classed as an RPG. I know RPG's are usually used for fantasy world's and stuff like Witcher but I'd still say they fall under it as well since you role play as Spider-Man and Deacon in a zombie world."
62213,Thats some bullshit son. Role playing game - the clues in the name
62214,"they may have RPG elements but they are not RPGs. the definition has not broadened. we could call ANYTHING an RPG becausr you always play a character, but that's not the definition for these games"
62215,That's not correct. By that definition wouldn't every game be classified as an RPG then?
62216,"Fallout 4, skyrim, alien isolation, borderlands"
62217,"Days Gone, it got some flak I don't think a lot of it is justified. The first 8 hours or so are a slog due to lack of skills and naff weapons but I think this makes a massive difference later as you realise just how bad even a small horde are. 

I've now started getting some decent weapons and skills and took down my first horde yesterday which felt awesome. 

I like the main character and the game is amazing graphically. The bike once you get some upgrades to it becomes really enjoyable to ride around on too."
62218,"I second this. Riding a motorcycle is my favourite thing to do in a video game, everything else is a plus."
62219,"in my opinion odyssey isn't worth the money, I would recommend witcher 3, infamous second son, Spider-Man, Batman games, AC origins."
62220,It goes on sale for under $30 quite often which i think is worth the price
62221,"Yeah odyssey is probably my least favourite game I've played this gen, shame cause that time period in Greece is fascinating"
62222,"Odyssey is a good game however, I do not recommend unless you are willing to only play odyssey. The reason I say this is that the game is great but it is ridiculously huge and there are tons to do. But wait isn’t this a good thing? I’d say yes *IF* the majority of the side quest content, battles and naval stuff didn’t feel so mundane and tedious. 

The game kinda goes like this;

Start an island/story quest, then do everything on said island/land including exploration, side quests, and the story quest up to and including overthrowing the leader and fighting the battle. Then move to next land/island and repeat. 

The story is good but the way the game level gates it is not. Unfortunately if you don’t get the exp boost out of the cash shop you will be barred from progressing naturally through the story and will find yourself doing all the side stuff just to get to the next level requirement. I am NOT saying this is a bad thing or that the game is less enjoyable, what I am saying is that by the time I was level 30ish I really just wanted to complete the main story and move on to other games so I got the booster and did just that.

They crafted a magnificent world and my god is breathtaking at times. I just felt like the game was 60%filler and 40% meaningful story/adventure. With the season pass there is all kinds of new content and stories, I haven’t had a chance to go back to them yet but I recommend getting the season pass if you get it, it goes on sale a lot. 

Hope this helps!"
62223,"> I am NOT saying this is a bad thing or that the game is less enjoyable, what I am saying is that by the time I was level 30ish I really just wanted to complete the main story and move on to other games so I got the booster and did just that.

To counter this perspective for /u/walnutbutt or anyone else. I think this depends on what you consider to be ""side-stuff"". I lost interest in the seemingly infinite side-quests and gained interest in the cult/mercenary stuff, which feels hand-in-hand with both your character progression and the storyline.

After I got to level 30, it felt like the pace of my progression exploded and very soon after I was brushing up against 45+, because at that point almost all of the map is available (or within reach). When focusing only on the main story, and cult, and the mercenaries, I never felt like I had to do any side quests to keep up with my leveling. Of course, I have not finished yet, so maybe that'll change once I'm past 50 or so. For the past 15+ levels though, I haven't had any gear that was on level because I had been leveling up too fast for my gear to stay current. 

I do agree that for this game, you have to be okay with passing up tons of sidequests and you have to be okay with quests and missions that send you in several directions, which is what starts to feel like filler. To continue the story you have to *go talk to this person*, but they want you to *do this* before they'll talk to you, and so forth. Which feels lazy sometimes.

But other than that, it feels like they put time into every side quest, doing *something* to make it feel interesting even if the overall structure is repetitive. 

So I recommend **not** completing every island you come across unless you need to or really want to. I very rarely do a side-quest anymore unless I just feel like staying in the area. I haven't found that I need to after level 20 or so and once the map starts opening up, there's always more things to do than somewhat meaningless side-quests."
62224,"Okay random question, I just downloaded odyssey and I can’t launch the game? Every time I click new game it brings me to the season pass screen. Do I need it to play?"
62225,">I never felt like I had to do any side quests to keep up with my leveling. Of course, I have not finished yet, so maybe that'll change once I'm past 50 or so. 

It won't. Level 50 was the original level cap so you will never be underleveled for any (non-DLC, not sure about DLC since I was 70+ by the time first episode dropped) zones after 50. Depending on your settings, enemies might be 2 levels above or below you but you won't have to grind experience or anything of the sort to progress with the story."
62226,Pretty spot and fair lil review. Kudos guy
62227,Thank you! I think I will download it after reading this comment for sure
62228,">Start an island/story quest, then do everything on said island/land including exploration, side quests, and the story quest up to and including overthrowing the leader and fighting the battle. Then move to next land/island and repeat. 

You don't actually have to do all that though. If you only do some sidequests in-between the main story you shouldn't have to grind any levels or anything. You can also just pick up all contracts in every town you visit. You will automatically finish them by just playing the game and they give you a lot of experience for free. You don't even have to go out of your way to turn them in, as soon as you finish the objective (stuff like kill 30 spartan soldiers, sink 5 athenian ships, kill 15 bandits..), it automatically awards you experience and money."

The first two are relatively linear shooters, (with some larger areas), Exodus is bigger, almost open world, think of the recent Tomb Raider trilogy in terms of scope.

They have amazing atmosphere."

Minecraft is one no not one the BEST game of all time it brings creative mode where you can fly and build whatever you want! And then theres survival mode (the best one) it begins with you punching a tree to going to another dimension and then fighting the final boss The Ender Dragon (easier than you expect) so get this if you want a fun and creative experience! 

Bot are great games both are open world and both are AMAZING! :)"
