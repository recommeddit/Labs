62237,Check out Prey. It's an open world first person shooter with horror and sci-fi elements. My favorite game this generation.
62238,"Horizon Zero Dawn 

Assassin’s Creed Origins/Odyssey 

Final Fantasy VII-IX"
62239,"Some of my favorites include The Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Final Fantasy 15, Dead Rising 4, Dying Light, and the Far Cry series. I'm currently about 50 hours into Persona 5 and I've been loving the experience. Very stylish and awesome music, as well. I'm not sure how well my recommendations will help you, considering I hated AC Origins and Odyssey, Horizon Zero Dawn, Life is Strange (is that considered an RPG?) and the new God of War. Seems you like open-world games or choice-based games. Good luck in your search!"
62240,"1. Skyrim
2. Witcher 3
3. Dragon’s Dogma
4. Neir Automata
5. Horizon Zero Dawn"
62241,"If you’re getting assassin’s creed, DONT GET ODYSSEY. It put a spin on the series that takes away all of its charm and makes it really basic. I would suggest one of the ps3 ones, but syndicate and origins are still good. Also skyrim. Skyrim is insane"
62242,"Odyssey is literally what he's after. Aside from Origins none of them are RPG's. Also, It's anything but basic considering all the builds and stats to upgrade."
62243,Have you played any rpgs
62244,"Yeah, it's my favourite genre. Why?"
62245,"Odyssey is boring. It doesn’t have a hook. It’s an endless grind of an rpg, and plays similar to all others I’ve heard played somehow."
62246,"It's hook is it's open world, the seas, locations to visit, it's a looter, replayable, shit loads of content, lots of weapons and armour. I mean, I've only played 200 hours of it and it's loved by many so what do I know.

Also, grind = rewards, which is always nice."
62247,"Ok but there’s black flag which is open world has tons of sea doesn’t have places which are locked until you play for hundreds of hours and is higher quality. Also, I don’t know how you grind, but for me grinding only gets me small amounts of xp most of the time and I usually get stuff that is worse than my current equipment so I have to do five or ten missions for every main mission because they each jump at least to levels!"
62248,To get good gear make sure level scaling is equal to yours or even higher and don't bother too much by the standard enemies. Go after bounty hunters or named enemies for the better stuff. Side missions usually get you good stuff.
62249,"I have gear that is better than gear levels above me! The game gave me legendary gear when I wasn’t  even level thirty. Plus, the bounty hunters are all much higher levels than me so they give me equipment that I can’t unlock for a while and when I get to that level I’ve gotten better rewards from main missions. I’m about level thirty six now, and most of my gear is legendary level thirty equipment. So, no matter how much grinding I do, it’s always useless. I guess that’s why it’s joyless for me."
62250,"Odyssey is a great game, but its a terrible Assassin's Creed game. My favorite is Black Flag, but I know its not a great AC game. I would do anything for a BF 2"
62251,"Honestly, I usually try to start with this, because I agree, but then I jsut get caught up with all my problems with it and forget my main thing.  Also, sorry to the op for this thread getting so out of hand"
62252,"I’m glad I didn’t buy it then, it was really the only one that sounded good"
62253,Get some second opinions. It's a great game.
62254,What do you like about it? I feel like that’s a really broad question but I’m curious. I haven’t played any of the assassins creed games in a while and felt like revisiting
62255,"It's nothing like the older Assassin's Creed games. You can climb anything, literally. There's a lot of different gear. It also takes place in ancient Greece, and the mythology is really cool, same with origins, but I like Greek mythology more."
62256,"The world is pretty incredible. It's vast but never gets unruly. I thought the ship combat was snappy. Story was interesting and engaging. I liked the combat and the way the gear is all centered on how you'd like to look, if you want that. It was fun and had that ""what's over thereness"" that I itch for sometimes."
62257,Yes! I love having a huge map or open world for that reason. I explore EVERYTHING to the point where I almost annoy myself.
62258,I annoy myself trying to get from one place to another
62259,"I like the setting. For all my endless complaints, it’s beautiful and the outfit aspect is pretty cool"
62260,Get origins. It’s really beautiful and fun

Fallout New Vegas

Chrono Trigger"
62633,Is Disco Elysiam that good? I’m generally curious.
62634,"Depends on what you’re looking for. It’s incredibly well written, does a really good job of managing its tone (so things never feel absurdly out of place, but also you never have that heavy feeling from reading/playing a never ending serious story.) Failing at something you try to do is usually amusing, and (almost) never stops you from moving forward. It’s an interesting story/plot, and well done as a murder mystery. The world is very different and interesting. The leveling system integrates thematically with the story. All that being said, it’s not gonna be interesting if you want fights. Or high fantasy. Or a power fantasy. Those things are great, but this isn’t that. Disco Elysium feels unique to some degree."
62635,"It's probably the best RPG of the last decade, but it's just an RPG, and doesn't have side mechanics to make gameplay more engaging, so it could be iffy to get into.
Nothing quite like it on the market."
62636,Disco! Nothing quite like it!

62640,Hey I played dark souls 3 and remaster by the time I finished the remaster I was exhausted with dark souls ... now iam in between the fence to try dark souls 2 ... any suggestions ?
62641,"No suggestions, just a heartfelt statement that dark souls 2 is great."
62642,tnx .. going to buy it when it is on sale .. and that is the only fromsoft game left for me to play on pc.
62643,"DS2 is great!

62649,"Shadowrun SNES hell yes, a 90s sleeper gem."
62650,"It's so good man. I know that most people say that the Genesis version is superior, but outside of the improved Matrix, the storytelling is nowhere near as solid. Also, the SNES version is actually canon and was based on a book from the Shadowrun series called ""*Never Deal with a Dragon""* by Robert Charrette. 

I actually own that first-edition book. Although it's not about Jake Armitage, it gives you a glimpse of what Drake was up to before the events of the game and really fleshes out that world. Iconic cyberpunk before that word became associated with disappointment, lol."
62651,"That's awesome, thanks for sharing that. I'll definitely have to give that book a shot.

I didn't care for the Genesis version. I also enjoyed the newer Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Hong Kong games on PC a lot more than most did. They could have been a lot deeper in terms of the world but I enjoyed them for what they were.

I think it helps that I'm only casually into cyberpunk as a genre, so I don't know what it's ""supposed"" to look and feel like, if that makes sense."
62652,"Cyberpunk looks and feels like a combination of the SNES Shadowrun and Shadowrun: Dragonfall, really. Shadowrun in general leans a bit into magic and that portion of it is not traditionally cyberpunk, but it nails the scene perfectly. 

It's everyday people being slave wages at the mercy of corporations and law enforcement agencies that have become so powerful that they're basically the new world government, the shady heads of those corporations who see people as a means to an end, and the underground scene rebelling against it, all placed into the backdrop of a world that's had the benefit of casualized advanced technology being accessible to practically everyone.

In a cyberpunk world, your quality of life is fully dependent on where you are in the pecking order, and your status is very much a ""where you're born is where you'll stay"" situation, so there are no valiant heroes or hopeful optimists. It's a bleak, uphill climb for glory for people at the bottom of the food chain just as much as it is for those at the top. Think Game of Thrones set in the year 2600 lol."

62705,"Applied Predictive Modeling is my favorite.  So many statistics books are ""Here's a technique, here are a bunch of proofs, here's how to use this technique on a canned problem.""  There's little discussion of why to pick a particular technique over another one, or how to solve a real world problem with messy data.

Applied Predictive Modeling is a book that assumes you know basic statistics and want to predict things.  There's little discussion of coefficients outside of ""After centering and scaling, magnitude could help"", and no canned problems.  It teaches you a bunch of techniques useful for a given type of problem, then goes through a case study on a real, messy dataset, explaining the decision process, how they picked features, and how they picked what models to try out.  It also has R code built on top of the caret package that lets you run all of this (although admittedly, it's REALLY old R code.)

I can't recommend this book enough."
62706,What are your views on the book 'The elements of statistical learning' by Hastie?
62707,"I like it a lot, but be aware that it's basically the opposite of Applied Predictive Modeling.  It's more for learning theory than for learning when you'd use a random forest to solve a classification problem."
62708,What do you suggest after Applied Predictive Modeling? I've read that and intro to statistical modeling
62709,Depends.  How good are you at mathematical statistics work?  Do you want to do more deep learning?  Are you looking to learn Python?  I can't really give advice unless you say what you know and what you're looking to do.
62710,"I have an applied mathematics degree so have taken some upper level statistics and probability classes.

I'm fluent in R and basic knowledge in Python. I've read deep learning in R and text mining in R. 

But am looking for more of a deeper dive to get a better understanding of everything."
62711,"Elements of Statistical Learning.  It's basically ISL but all of the theory involved.  You might also want to check out Computer Age Statistical Inference.  It's also very focused on the math, but more on computational statistics methods."
62712,Thanks! Is there a ton of overlap between ESL and Applied Predictive Modeling?
62713,"Yes in terms of what techniques are covered.  No in terms of the way the material is covered.

62724,"/r/totallynotrobots 

Your welcome!"
62726,"You could, but it would be a really bad idea.  Blindly applying models you don’t understand makes it really easy to fit a model that looks good on paper, but fails terribly when applied to the real world.  Or you’ll end up testing 100 different models without knowing which ones work well for which types of problems.

I’d highly recommend going through Introduction to Statistical Learning first.  Make sure you understand the techniques in it before you move on.  Once you’ve done a bunch of the exercises and feel comfortable explaining what the techniques do to other people, move on to Applied Predictive Modeling."
62728,It’s the name of a book that’s both a fantastic introduction and free online.  And don’t worry about the questions!  You’re brand new to this.

62733,"I agree, it's a really great book that I recommend even to people who don't know R."
62734,Is it a good book for beginners?
62735,Not if you have no DS background.  Learn the basics first.
62736,"Not sure if this is too ""pop statistics"" for what you guys are looking for, but I'm currently reading *The Signal and the Noise* by Nate Silver and think it's a good starting point for people interested in using data effectively."
62737,I think it's an awesome book.  I recommend that every data professional read it.  Not because of the material as much as because of how well Nate Silver communicates complicated mathematical information in a way that a layman can easily understand it.  There's a reason why he's the most famous statistician on the planet.
62738,Nate Silver certainly communicates the stats well but I found it very off-putting that he seems to be ignorant of actual statistics. I couldn't even finish his book and since reading half of it I stopped listening to his podcast and visiting his site.
62739,"> he seems to be ignorant of actual statistics.

What do you mean by this? I'm not a statistician or data scientist yet, but I've taken a bit of stats and haven't heard him get anything wrong. What are the big things he's missing?"
62740,"It's clear that he's missing the mentality that a lot of statisticians and mathematicians have especially when he makes pronouncements about his models and how ""good"" they are when he and his team refuse to reveal how they work which implies he has something to hide. He talks a ton in his book about how he predicted the results in ""all 50 states"" as to which would vote Romney or Obama in the 2012 election but any good statistician knows that one success hardly proves the model and foolish to pretend so. He also never lets on that he understands concepts in statistics that are considered more advanced such as information theory, different types of norms, the bootstrap, etc although this could feasibly be because he is trying to make his work ""accessible"". I think it's very telling that he was once a SABERmetrician and proselytized his model called PECOTA - I don't think any practicing statistician regards such models as rigorous.

Read [this article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-a-stats-prof-heres-why-nate-silvers-model-was-all-over-the-place_us_582238dce4b0d9ce6fbf69b6)."
62741,"> when he makes pronouncements about his models and how ""good"" they are

Did you even read *The Signal and the Noise*?  He has an entire chapter dedicated to domains where mathematical modeling has made no progress.  He specifically cites earthquakes as a phenomenon where there are very few instances in the world with lots of noisy data.  He discusses many mathematicians who have tried to predict earthquakes and why every one of them has failed.  I mean the the subtitle of the book is *Why Most Predictions Fail – but Some Don't*.

He also talks about the value of sabermetrics compared to the value of a baseball scout watching players run and deciding who to sign based on that, and concludes that the scouts have really useful information that the sabermetrics people don't.  He states that sometimes the people with domain experience can get more out of little information that the sabermetrics people can with less domain experience and a lot of less important information."
62742,"Yeah that response seemed a bit up its ass to me. I'm not done with The Signal and the Noise yet, but the commenter seems convinced Silver spends the whole book talking about how perfect his models are when what I've liked about the book is how careful Silver is to *not* make those claims. He goes out of his way to acknowledge that choosing easy battles and not overselling the odds is the main reason for his success."
62743,"Seriously.  Even during the 2016 election he was pleading caution due to the number of undecided voters and the amount of uncertainty compared to 2012.  I just get the impression that OP hasn't actually read this book, as the content itself refutes everything he's saying."
62744,"Admittedly only read the first half of the book because I couldn't get through it (I was previously a fan of FiveThirtyEight but reading the book was a shock to me). It sounds like I may have missed something in the latter part of the book where he refutes his earlier ""claims to fame"".

I want to make clear that I *do not* think that Nate Silver is more terrible than others in his area of election forecasting and the like - in fact, I think he is far better and more ""statistically-minded"". I simply tried to make a point that I was under the impression he was a rigorous statistician and the fact is that he is not. This goes back to my point that he does not publish his models and thus is not scrutinizable which is to say that he is unverifiable in his claims.

Maybe this should be in /r/gatekeeping but as far as I'm concerned, someone who does not subject their work to scrutiny through transparency or else peer-review isn't a rigorous statistician."
62745,"> This goes back to my point that he does not publish his models and thus is not scrutinizable which is to say that he is unverifiable in his claims.

To be blunt, that's a really bad reason to claim that someone isn't a rigorous statistician.  Plenty of people who are rigorous statisticians won't publish their models because they work in an environment where models are considered trade secrets.  And [Fivethirtyeight actually *does* publish its methodology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/).  This is a detailed description of every model behavior, how they do simulations, how they do trend line adjustments, how they prioritize polls, etc.  Short of publishing the actual model as a binary file, I'm not sure what else you expect from them."
62746,"Of course I'm not counting those cases; I wouldn't expect Jane Street Capital to publish its methods open-source. What I'm saying is that Nate Silver has no training in that sort of rigor expected of graduate students and active researchers in statistics the types of which compose many financial trading firms or other. I've read that page before and that's not really what I'm talking about in terms of publishing methods. I'm speaking more like a white paper or a journal article: I want to see cross-validation, at least bootstrapping to estimate standard error, I want p-values and such. I want something verifiable because his qualitative descriptions are not that. I see you have an MS so I mean you've probably had to dig through a journal article or followed someone else's methods to reproduce results.

Sure what he has is better than nothing but according to my definition of a statistician, he doesn't fulfill that. If he had previously published peer-reviewed work and was active in the stats community then I would be more inclined. I'll call him a ""data pundit"" sure and I mean he himself also refuses to be called a ""statistician""."
62748,I still stand by my statement that Nate Silver's statistics work should be suspect in that he hasn't been formally tested or subjected himself to such and I haven't seen evidence against that. I will say that I probably should have finished the book as it seems he clarifies statements about his own predictive ability which I thought he was adamantly certain of.
62749,"I’m not trying to be a Nate Silver apologist but Silver often says the 2012 elections were easy and that he shouldn’t be praised so highly for that prediction since there was so little uncertainty. 538 lacks transparency in its models but they’re driving traffic not publishing. 

And that article jumped on its high horse early on Election Day to say 538’s results were obviously wrong but in retrospect it’s the only model that gave the actual winner a reasonable chance. Maybe it’s not a strictly rigorous model but it worked best in a situation of high uncertainty whereas every other model was over confident in the face of uncertainty."
62750,"He may say that he shouldn't be praised so highly but that's not apparent from his book in which he goes on and on about how great his models are. Sure they may drive traffic and aren't publishing *per se* but that doesn't lessen the criticism that there is reason to doubt the rigor of the team's modeling efforts.

To your second point, sure I agree that his model worked ""best"" and likewise I will never say that 538 does a worse job than nearly any other agency but what I'm saying is that statistics isn't about being overconfident or ""conservative"", it's about being appropriately certain because your model is appropriate based upon concrete priors about the structure of the system in question and being certain about the structure of your uncertainty (and being transparent about it all the while). Like I said before, I'm not sure that Nate Silver really understands statistics beyond the introductory level because I've not seen any evidence to refute my intuition."
62751,"I don’t know. I get what you’re saying about opaque methodology but it seems silly to suggest that someone who has an Econ degree, does better predictive political modeling than most, and does decent predictive sports modeling only has an introductory grasp on statistics."
62752,"One of the reasons why I precisely believe that he only has an introductory grasp on modeling is the fact that he only has an Econ degree. To my knowledge, no undergrad econ degree has sufficient statistics requirements that I would trust a person, with just that qualification, to do rigorous work in statistics (I have never heard of any econ major taking more than the intro level). I wouldn't even trust someone with an undergrad degree in stats to do that either. I'd only trust someone with a quantitative PhD in stats or econometrics to do such work and there's a reason why it takes over a decade studying statistics to be called a ""statistician"". The fact that he does ""better than most"" isn't indicative because none of the others likewise have any background in stats either to my knowledge. I should add that most statisticians eschew things such as elections because there isn't enough data (and far too many variables) in order to make good predictions about it although I certainly could be wrong about this sentiment.

I work with a ton of scientists/statisticians/mathematicians/and ML researchers (all with PhDs) and I have never heard from them any positive opinion of Nate Silver and his work besides the fact that he makes stats ""sexy"". [Here](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/10/01/is-nate-silver/) is a charitable opinion of Nate Silver by a statistician that also alludes to the opposite sentiment which I espouse."
62753,"I never suggested he was doing doctorate or post-doc level work just that it was non introductory. Your bar for what is the minimum requirement for statistical rigor is insanely high. You don’t need a PhD or even a masters to do modeling especially if you’ve been working with models for years. The suggestion that only doctorates with 10 years of experience can be trusted to do mathematical modeling would preclude most of the people who do things like financial modeling. I work in biotech on a small r&d team and there’s plenty of relying on masters and undergrads to do a lot of the mathematical work. It’s refined as a team and everyone’s input is taken seriously. I say this with the best of intentions, but I think opening up on who has valid input or who could be trusted to do mathematical work would serve you well in your life especially if you do research. I’m often shocked by what random bits of highly relevant knowledge people from diverse backgrounds have. 

To your point about election data. There is lack of election data, particularly for the presidency (1 data point every four years). 538 uses polls though which has a lot more data points and historical track records. But being successful in an environment of low information I think shows a lot of statistical intuition even if they lack formal training. 

And he does make statistics interesting. Which, to get back to the original comment, was why Silver’s book was suggested, not because it was full of mathematics and deep explanations of esoteric subjects."
62754,"I think we are just using different definitions and so let me define my terms and explain my reasoning.

**Rigorous**: I use this to meant that you've followed best practices and have subjected your scrutiny to the work of others. Why I reserve this term almost exclusively for the work of those that have done this at the graduate level is because they've usually published in peer\-reviewed journals of which leaders in the field \(far smarter than they are\) have critiqued their work. You're free to use a different definition but that's the one I use. Nate Silver has done none of this so I don't consider him to be a ""rigorous statistician"".

**Non\-introductory**: I consider the work done usually at the undergraduate or early undergraduate level to be ""introductory"" and the more advanced work done during graduate classes to be ""non\-introductory"". The latter category is only really done by those upperclassmen in the respective major or graduate students in that or a related field. I have not seen Nate Silver work with concepts beyond the ""introductory"" not least of which is because he and his team conduct their work with opacity. Again, you are free to use a different definition \(not saying you're wrong or I'm right just that we can't come to a conclusion while using different frameworks of thought\).

I also never said he *didn't* make statistics interesting, only that his statistics is not rigorous a la my previously definition of what rigor is. I never said it was a bad suggestion necessarily only that there should be the caveat that his work shouldn't be confused for rigorous data science/statistics."
62755,"how is saying someone has a 25% chance of winning, and having that person win, indicates the models were ""wrong""? That's a dumb thing to say"
62756,"> And that article jumped on its high horse early on Election Day to say 538’s results were obviously wrong but in retrospect it’s the only model that gave the actual winner a reasonable chance.

I am just confused by that poster arguing 2012 isn’t enough data to tout Nate Silver but then using 2016 to tear him down?"

also watch the videos!  [https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) 

This book is probably recommended more than any other book on /r/datascience, and for good reason. The material is accessible enough after a little bit of calculus, shows you some of the theoretical aspects and really gives you a good idea of what different algorithms do and when to apply them. It has a practical end of chapter section devoted to applying the principles used.

A great introduction to deep learning techniques. Included are chapters on the theory behind how these models work, and longer form, tutorial style chapters on applying deep learning techniques. This book covers Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision, Recurrent and LSTM Neural Networks for natural language processing, transfer learning, and even generative models.

One question: how much is R favored over Python in practical settings? This is just based off of my own observation, but it seems to me that R is the preferred language for ""pure"" data scientists, while Python is a more sought-after language from hiring managers due to its general adaptability to a variety of software and data engineering tasks. I noticed that Francois Chollett also as a book called  [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539194430&sr=1-5&keywords=Deep+Learning+with+R) , which looks to have a near identical description as the Deep Learning with R book, and they were released around the same time.

I think having some understanding of causal inference and quasi experimental methods is critical in data science and this is definitely the best text I've read on the matter (It's baby brother [Mastering Metrics](http://masteringmetrics.com/) is great too). 

I've just come back from a data science and machine learning conference and was shocked at how much time was spent on acknowledging pitfalls that are absolutely obvious to even undergrads in econometrics, e.g endogeneity, identification issues, structual relationships and simultaneity. All issues econometric models are designed to deal with. 

Even if you think these issues have no relation to your own modelling (you're wrong), this text is worth scanning to get a broader idea of what's actually on the table for a data scientist to assess (likely more than you think).

A few quotes from the book on why he chose it.:

>""Spreadsheets are not the sexiest tools around. In fact, they’re the Wilford\-Brimley\-selling\- Colonial\-Penn of the analytics tool world. Completely unsexy. Sorry, Wilford. ""

>""This is not a book about coding. In fact, I’m giving you my “no code” guarantee \(until Chapter 10 at least\). Why?  Because I don’t want to spend a hundred pages at the beginning of this book messing with Git, setting environment variables, and doing the dance of Emacs versus Vi.""

>""Now, this is all a bit of a lie. The final chapter in this book is actually on moving to the data science\-focused programming language, R. It’s for those of you that want to use this book as a jumping point to deeper things. ""

>""But that’s the point. Spreadsheets stay out of the way. They allow you to see the data and to touch \(or at least click on\) the data. There’s a freedom there. In order to learn these techniques, you need something vanilla, something everyone understands, but nonethe\- less, something that will let you move fast and light as you learn. That’s a spreadsheet.

62792,"Answers to such questions depend on background. However, for and from the statistics community (as opposed to signal processing, control, or cs) maybe try:

Simon Wood - Core Statistics

It kinda starts from scratch on one hand (tells you what hypothesis test is), yet follows a rapid exposition into regression with MLE and with optimization, then with formulating simple hierarchical models and Gibbs and MCMC samplers. Most remarkably, it shows you R code to support all of that trhoughout all chapters. It ends with GLMs. It's dense, but it has a point of going from scratch->through derivation->to code.

The author is a well published data analyst for the academic sciences, if that helps you as an endorsement."

Also useful when somebody asks you to explain data science to them ""in five minutes"". After a quick overview you can refer them to this book.

Sorry for the late response, but yes I think financial math would be useful. A majority of jobs in data science are related to the finance, marketing and insurance industries. As a result, understanding financial mathematics could be very useful in the future. 

Simply put, financial math deals with the metrics that are important to the running of a business. As a data scientist, we seek to understand and predict metrics. Understanding financial mathematics will allow you to work with those metrics much better, since you will have a firmer grasp of their nuances."

62833,Statistical Rethinking and Elements of Statistical Learning are the big ones for me.
62834,It's awesome to see Statistical Rethinking gaining popularity. I'm seeing more and more people mention it on Reddit. Are people also using more applied Bayesian analysis in industry as well?
62835,"From my experience, very few people are using Bayesian inference in their job. However, it provides incredible depth of understanding and provides a framework to approach new problems."
62836,So then what do they use? Just off the shelf regressions or random effects models? Why isn't that popular on the job?
62837,"xgboost dominates, but more generally, Bayesian methods are slow, datasets tend to be large enough not to matter and explaining results to stakeholders is much more difficult with Bayesian methods."
62838,">explaining results to stakeholders is much more difficult with Bayesian methods

Bruh, easier than explaining what the heck a confidence interval is. 

If you say, ""thats easy"", then this is why you need to brush up on your bayesian stats. Confidence intervals are a construct from hell meant to trick us into thinking its a credible interval."
62840,"> Bayesian 

Not there yet, but working hard on it."
62841,"It's not that credible intervals are easier than confidence intervals, but that the people you're speaking too have heard of one and not of the other. 

You never need to explain results to someone without any statistics knowledge, when the reality is that they're already very versed in one and don't want to put in the work to learn something new. Cultural change is infinitely harder.

Then the reality of Bayesian analysis is very different. It works well when the models are there, but stuff like trees and boosting don't fit, and Bayesian neural nets don't have an advantage over normal ones with dropout."
62842,"People who I speak to barely know what a confidence interval is and even people who study stats get it wrong because it’s so unintuitive. Seriously, if you say ""its not that credible intervals are easier to understand"" then even you don’t understand the difference. [One is objectively more intuitive](https://youtu.be/KhAUfqhLakw?t=1250) and people always mix up one for the other. Guess which one that is?

The only difficulty is that bayesian stats requires a lot more background and time to understand and learn completely. The calculations are also a little more involved. (This is only true if you are using MCMC, also, while deep learning is king nobody can complain about high computational requirements being an issue.) But once you do all of that then you're left with something that's easier to communicate to everyone.

And yes, I need to explain stuff to people with no/limited stats knowledge.

You use bayesian in the case where you can’t run large experiments and you don’t have a lot of data and there’s a lot of uncertainty. Using a bayesian analysis you can quantify all of that uncertainty and still make informed decisions under such conditions.

You're thinking about this wrong if you think this is Bayesian vs XGBoost, because you would use these tools under different circumstances!"
62843,"Hm, I find that explaining the results of a Bayesian model is a lot easier than explaining black-box algorithms like XGBoost. I can draw a graphical representation of the inference and then say: 'if this happens, then the probability of that happening goes up, and then the probability of \_this\_ happening goes down and so on, until we get to the final prediction.'"
62844,Absolutely. And it really nails home the message that model =/= reality.
62845,We are using BMA quite often. But then 3/5 data scientist/analysts (job title is unclear in our org) went to the same uni and wrote their thesis for the same prof.
62846,"There are a few of us out here. I just met up with a colleague recently to talk through some Bayesian Markov Chain models he's building at his new gig. It was super fun.  
I can tell you it's my go-to tool for doing any kind of statistical work. These days either home-rolled for simple cases or using PyMC3 for anything that isn't trivial."
62847,Nice what field are you working in?
62848,"Currently, logistics. And doing some marketing gig work on the side."
62849,"Relevant username :)

May I ask what kind problems do you work on with Bayesian methods? As other posters have said, Bayesian models are generally slower to train and do not result in quite as good results as say, XGboost. 

I have read some parts of statistical rethinking, watched the course videos on youtube, read Bayesian Methods for Hackers  plus a mishmash of other resource and I still cannot really think of a problem where I'd rather use a bayesian model over the usual suspects (xgboost, lightgbm). The only place I might use say, pymc3, is if it's an inference problem and I have to come up with solid numbers to back my claim so I'm curious to know what others use it for."
62850,"Good catch! No one's ever picked up on the Metropolis reference before.I use Bayesian models in three broad cases:

1. When I'm trying to do something beyond prediction. For example, I want to look into causal relationships or I want to evaluate a hypothesis, or I want to get a distribution as my output so I can do an economic analysis and have meaningful intervals.
2. When I want to inject significant domain knowledge into the models --- if I know that certain relationships between variables exist and I have meaningful priors.

I will also use it for inference like you mentioned, as part of EDA, as a way to get a more interpretable model and so on. I also find it can work better in cases where you really do have partial pooling.

But, yeah, for simple predictive models it's basically always XGBoost or linear regression."
62851,Ah I see. Makes sense.
62852,"There's a course video on youtube?

62880,"I'm interested in what people will say, but honestly, old-school books (don't get me wrong, I love them) haven't really been the foundation or the propagation of my career in data science. My data science journey semi-officially began when I picked up bioinformatics in college. All of my bioinformatics textbooks in college were (free, yay!) open-source online texts - it generally takes \~7+ years for information to go to hard copy print, and what we were working on was far too cutting edge for that. Currently the only data science resource I actively pay for is Datacamp. Just about everything else I use lives on the internet for free (maybe I give a nominal donation to the author.)

Data science touches tons of other fields, though. I love traditional textbooks for some more established and less rapidly changing fields like statistics, calculus, old-school microbiology basics, well known medical knowledge, geology, etc etc. I'm happy to offer some recommendations if you point me toward some specific other fields."
62881,"I'm still a beginner in this world and one of my main resource is Datacamp, so it's nice to see more experienced people use it. However may I ask why? I'm just curious about what, someone in the field of bioinformatics, can get from Datacamp and find it useful on his day to day work."
62882,"Datacamp has the most solid collection of absolute-beginner to mid-level-but-not-in-depth content I’ve seen on data science to date. A lot of courses are taught by the people who created the popular packages they’re teaching you about. I recommend Rosalind more for a comparable self-learning collection for bioinformatics specifically though. I pay for Datacamp because I’m a big fan of the format for efficient bursts of interactive learning, it’s super easy and kinda fun to blaze through a 4 hour course on the weekend on a topic I feel I’m not quite solid on. Is it suitable for deep dives? Hell no. Can it help you think about common problems in your field and jump-start your problem-solving kit when you’re not yet senior level? Yeah, I think so."
62883,Thank you for your answer!
62884,"Honestly, my biggest advice to a novice data scientist would be this: “once you’re any good at it you’re going to spend waaaayy more time explaining to people how your models work than actually building them.”

So get really solid on explaining to non-data scientists (and bosses strangely obsessed with p values) how your shit actually helps them."
62885,yeah how do you do this besides experience...often times you only have one shot...one opportunity

62896,"[Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman's Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) is one of the most well-written mathematical texts I've read. Coming from geometric function theory, I especially appreciate the geometric point of view. Bonus: [Free PDF online](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/download.html)!

Beyond a solid theoretical foundation like that found in Hastie, et al, I've found the best teacher to be experience."
62897,"there is also 'an introduction to statistical learning with applications in R' which is a little less technical, by Hastie and a few others"
62898,"I have a list [here](http://digital-thinking.de/recommended-resources/), but it's more engineering focused. I would recommend factfulness, even if it's just a data driven world view, not related to data science."
62899,*Regression Analysis Microsoft Excel* by Conrad Carlberg.  I learned a lot about how to set up statistical analysis within Excel and only Excel.  My boss didn't want me using R.  I generated some very accurate predictions using simple linear regression that I learned from this book.
62900,Do you have any good books for people used to Excel but want to learn python or R? My husband is mentoring a security analyst who wants to learn Python. (My SO doesn't know R but it could be useful too).
62901,"There is a book on R by the same author, R for Microsoft Excel Users.  It's a very gentle introduction to R."
62902,"OP, so that you know, you mention uncle Bob's ""[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)"", but your link redirects to the book ""Clean Code**r**"". They're both great, but different.

I've ordered the book [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962). Looks great to brush up the basics of statistics and machine learning. Since I haven't actually read it yet, take my input with a grain of salt."
62903,Got the prac book. It’s pretty useful and gives a general layout on statistical methods to machine learning. Nothing is too in depth and I would pair it up with actual examples that you can work on which will help speed things up.
62904,"Since you've read both, which of Clean Code and Clean Coder would you recommend of I only have time to read one?"
62905,"I'm still reading ""Clean code"", but read already ""Clean Coder"". The latter is ""softer"" (easier to read) than the former, since it has to do with the soft skills of a programmer and how he interacts with other people. The Clean code on the other hand takes more effort to read and understand, because it describes best practices of coding along with lists of Java code which you're expected to study. For this reason reading and digesting the ""Clean code"" takes more time.

If you'd like to buy one of the two, I'd suggest you to get the ""Clean code"" and perhaps borrow the ""Clean coder"" from a friend."
62906,Practical Statistics is absolutely worth the ~$14 for interview prep.
62907,The deep learning book by Goodfellow along with Elements of statistical learning are the must.
62908,I found this book to be much of a theory without much of application. Felt that first chapter he sort of gave a very brief overview of the topics. Not something for new data scientist in the field
62909,"If you follow “uncle bobs” path you will be a gate keeper, unpleasant to work with and misogynistic. Some of his stuff is good,  but to many others it’s the equivalent of saying “I’m an asshole”. 
 
Obviously you can choose to use whatever references you wish. 

Some of these are based on my own interactions with him and general knowledge. Google will tell you enough if you’re so inclined. 

Do not assume everything he writes is correct or worth following. 

I’m sure I’ll get downvoted to hell but that’s why there’s a block function."
62910,I'm a woman so gender issues are important to me. This is the first I've heard about him being misogynistic. Can you point me to an article?
62911,"I googled it because OC is a moron and can't link to proof.

He's said some riqué things in the past. None of which are egregious enough to call him a misogynist, IMO. He's even gone on to renounce some of the things he said in [this](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/10/26/LaughterInTheMaleDominatedRoom.html) blog post.

[This](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/10/26/LaughterInTheMaleDominatedRoom.html) is what /r/programming had to say about it. (The usual anti-sjw sentiment, I guess.)

From reading his article, I think this is a false alarm. /u/datascigeek is using the term too loosely here IMO (not to mention that not backing their statement up while saying things like this is fucking stupid and why they shouldn't be believed.)"
62912,"No, because I knew it would become an attack on myself. OP can do research and make up her own mind, everyone has a different bar for what’s acceptable, Americans tend to have lower standards in this regards than Europe or Canada."
62913,It’s easy to find...there’s memes galore.
62914,"I understand some people don't like it since it is fairly mathematically rigorous, but coming from an undergraduate math education, [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) was a great introduction to statistics and machine learning.

I found it pretty refreshing to have an introduction to data science that doesn't waste your time or worry about simplifying the math or ""hard parts"". If you can hack it, I definitely recommend it over the hundreds of tutorials and guides and online courses that may be quicker or easier but will never give you a truly thorough understanding of these topics.

In terms of learning Python, I recommend [Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/b/b3/Python_introduction-2016.pdf)
by Kevin Sheppard. It's very good for people who know how to program but want to learn how Python is used for data science."
62915,"'R for data science' by Hadley and Garrett (available online also: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a decent practical introduction with examples and questions to test yourself with. It is a good read as an introduction, it will provide you with enough skills to jump into more specific follow up texts. 

'Data Science for Business' is a good introduction to understand what machine learning algorithms are doing, which is good for understanding. However, the book does not approach this from a programming point of view, but a conceptual point of view, so you cannot implement it directly in your language of choice.

I have not personally read it but 'Data science from scratch' is meant to be a good introduction that goes through some 'data science theory' and Python code. It would be helpful, though not totally necessary to know a bit of python beforehand.

Someone previously commented to mention 'Elements of statistical learning' which I have seen recommended by people in the industry but with the warning it can be heavy going. 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R' is meant to be an easier introduction, but I have not gone through it myself - it's next on my list."
62916,"I second the recommendation of ""R for Data Science"". You'll be making beautiful visualizations in no time. It's also great in that it doesn't pretend everything is peaches n' cream when it comes to data. You'll learn how to effectively clean and transform your data for analysis.  Really, really great book."
62917,"Signal and the noise and algorithms to live by were very good at expanding how I think about problems and how relying too heavily on data can be detrimental. As far as textbooks go, Elements of statical learning seems to be a high watermark amongst the DS community."
62918,"Data Science from Scratch is definitely my favorite introductory text.
It has a great bare-bones introduction to Python to get you up and running, and has you actually build up some ml algorithms to better grasp what they're doing under the hood."
