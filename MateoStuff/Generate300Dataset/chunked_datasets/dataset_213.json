70258,Trust me. U don’t learn much there. Self taught + paid tutorials is better
70259,You dont need a degree to become a artist tho lol why spend the money
70260,Because you can’t get past the “gatekeepers” at any major companies without a degree. Your portfolio will never get to the hiring manager.
70261,"Undergrad senior majoring in studio art, I don’t want to go to art school but I’m extremely happy with my choice of majors. Any job that I truly want, I can honestly get with the degree I have. Sure, I can’t get a computer science job, but I don’t want it. I don’t regret a thing, I’ve had an enormous amount of fun these past 4 years and thoroughly enjoyed myself and will get a rewarding job afterwards"
70262,"I'm studying anthropology, but honestly wish I skipped the university part & went to culinary school  instead. My dream was to open my own bakery, I gave up on that dream because I was worried it would be too competitive and not enough money in it. Now I'm about to do a Human Resource Management diploma, but only because A) I don't know what else to do B) All the career quizzes say I'll be good at it."
70263,...ya got any of those career quizzes? I could use one :/
70264,I remember Sokanu being pretty accurate for me
70265,thank you!!
70266,I just googles career quizzes and just did a bunch of random ones
70267,"> I was worried it would be too competitive and not enough money in it

Anthropology is not a good program to avoid this reality."
70268,I am aware there isn't a lot of money in anthropology but at the time I assumed university meant guaranteed good job (I was naive at the time) thats why I'm going into a different program and not sticking with Anthropology when I graduate
70269,"Perhaps try looking at some marking jobs, they sometimes hire people with anthropology degrees"
70270,"I've always wanted to have a bakery or be a world class cook. I loving cooking and baking so much, and I make amazing food for a 16 year old. However, I'vee read a lot that culinary school is not worth the time and money unless you are truly inexperienced. Most people say just get a job working at a restaurant and work your way up, experience is worth more in the culinary world I guess."
70271,"Yeah I was in the same boat when I was 16. You're probably right but culinary school looks like so much fun to me, plus some of the schools offer chocolate classes. I took a cupcake decorating class and enjoyed it so much! I would love to get experience at a bakery"
70272,"I would love to go to culinary school, but with the way things are currently, it would be cheaper to go through with college. At least for the first two years, as the state pays for tuition."
70273,"No regrets but I wished I would’ve double majored in Statistics. Just have the Stats minor. If you’re a good student, double majoring can be a really cool experience."
70274,What was your major?
70275,I’m in Psychology!
70276,Interesting combo there. I'm an Econ major who is considering minoring in Stats.
70277,"Would you mind me asking why statistics? 
I am also majoring in psychology & am a freshman this year. 
I would love to hear what statistics could contribute while majoring in psych."
70278,"Oh man, great question. I often think in analogies: If psychology was a human body, in which theories and constructs (I.e. depression, intimacy, cognitive dissonance) are muscle & fat, then statistics and experimental design are it's the skeleton. If you see yourself as a scientist and want to go to graduate school to conduct research, you need to have a more than adequate grasp of statistics. They are what make Psychology a science. I could probably write several paragraphs about their codependency.   
If you're a freshman, you’ve got Stats for Psychology & Experimental Methods on your course horizon. These are the most important classes you can take if you want to go to graduate school."
70279,"Does this include Master's programs, as well?

I've taken two stats courses and one research methods course so far and I've done well in all of them, but I struggled quite hard to get an A in the Stats courses. As of now I'm pretty sure I wanna be a master's-level clinician, which I don't think is as research-heavy as a PhD, but correct me if I'm wrong?"
70280,"It really depends on the program you are looking at! They differ even within Clinical at the MSC/MA level.  
I suggest finding a professor you really click with and see if they’d be willing to casually mentor you on your academic aspirations!"
70281,I'm an econ major but I took a psych-stats class and it was really cool to learn about different behaviors using statistics and even predicting them. I really enjoyed it! It also helped with econometrics which is stats heavy.
70282,"That's why I decided to do that. I'm a BS in CS major, but making myself a double major BS in Applied Math was a no brainer. I already had plenty of credits from the math minor and it added just one extra semester."
70283,Great choice. Some days I wish I actually minored/doubled in CS. It’s so relevant for Psychology right now.
70284,"I'm happy with my STEM degree, but some days I wish my life was like an episode of BMS"
70285,"As a stem major I definitely can’t have as much fun as my business major friends, but if you are organized and plan ahead a little bit, there’s time in most weeks to go out or even just hang out with friends and have a good time"
70286,Don't we all?
70287,"College is what you make of it, there are plenty of STEM guys i know who party hard"
70288,Battery Management System???
70289,"I’m now in an engineering school, but always wished that my parents sent me to piano lessons when I was a child and then I’d go to a conservatoire and finished a degree in piano performance. Sucks that I was late at realizing what I want to do with my life and honestly it’s now too damn late to pursue it all. A concert pianist is what I aspire to be"
70290,This goes through my head like every day
70291,If you're still alive there's always an opportunity
70292,"No regrets about what im studying (studio art + business) i just wish my life had turned out differently than it did so far and it didnt take me so long to get to this point with nothing to show for it, i was a dropout for 5 years"
70293,"I feel similar. I wasted three years in college being aimless and not achieving anything, but I hope I can succeed in the new program I’m in!"
70294,"I can relate to how you feel, was a dropout for 4-5 years and it set me back. If I stayed in school i’d have my degree by now and be in law school, but at the same time my grades probably wouldn’t have been good if I stayed in school."
70295,"what did you do in this time? I'm trying to go back to school after 1.5-2 yrs and a very wasteful period (reclusive, depressed, turned to gaming all day for most of 2020). I decided today to go back but it might be too late for applications for semester 1 (I'm in Australia, school starts this month). And I dread the thought of 5 more months of doing nothing"
70296,That about sums up how I feel as well.
70297,"I went back to school after 16 years working in jobs I didn't like.

 It's never too late!!"
70298,Same. I was a high school dropout and was heavily into drugs and alcohol... Was in and out of prison for years and ended up in a horticulture class while doing my last prison sentence. I found I actually enjoyed learning and now I'm back in school with four years off drugs and alcohol. I'm about to get my AA degree and just sent in my application for University. It's never too late and I feel like I learned a ton of lessons over those 15 years that no school could ever teach me. The University I'm applying for has a program where I can get my MBA in 3 more years and I'm excited what the future has to offer.
70299,"I feel the same. I went straight into college after high school but had no idea what I wanted to do. I have changed my major 10+ times. I should have graduated this semester, but I have another two years to go. Once I graduate I will have been in school for 6 years just to get my bachelors. A huge waste of money and time :("
70300,Astrophysics. I’m doing biochem which is cool but that solving the universe shit gets me off.
70301,"Same here, don’t get me wrong, I love my major, but I think studying the universe would be cool too."
70302,"I love my biochem major, but I am constantly drawing / creating things in my free time. I'm sure I would've had a great time in the art field"
70303,Have you looked into astrobiology? Your biochem background would probably be an asset!
70304,"You know, I really haven’t. That’s something great to consider though. What a world we live in"
70305,I used to be an astrophysics major then switched to psychology. I love everything about astrophysics except I wanted to work with kids and help them. I regret not pursing an astrophysics minor :/
70306,"Same. Studying engineering and in grad school now. While I research a bunch of cool fundamental physics related stuff in my field, it's not the same as studying space time. However, I'm not naturally gifted at math-let alone advanced math, but am at other skills applicable to the field I'm studying. 

If you're still an undergrad and think you could do well at astrophysics you definitely still have time to switch. If you go to grad school in another subject it will become almost impossible to change after that or at least the time/money commitment will be hard to justify"
70307,Ah I’ve accepted my place :) I’m heading to grad school for biophysics. Still super cool stuff I can do with that! Plus I’m not super advanced with math either. I can deal with modest quantum theory stuff but being an actual astrophysicist would probably break my brain
70308,"Damn, I guess I’m comforted slightly by people wishing they could do something else, but it also saddens me. College is just rough."
70309,Medical Geography actually! I think it would be useful and I think it would have made for a better college experience. I’m finishing up my psych degree now and I don’t feel accepted in my program. I am excited to just be done. Sometimes I just look at the class list for a medical geography degree and dream. We all make mistakes!
70310,I study philosophy and am starting Law School this fall. I sort of wound up there as an accident. However now that I'm graduating I wish I studied something I actually liked- I've always really enjoyed my ECON courses and Political Science courses 🥸 so one of those with the same career goal at least that I have now 😌
70311,"I’m curious how you ended up in law school as an accident? it’s quite pricy, especially if you don’t want to be a lawyer"
70312,Hahaha sorry I wasn't clear! I ended up in philosophy as an accident! The law school was very purposeful haha
70313,I have no regrets studying my career but I really want to go back to school for engineering or chemistry.
70314,What did you originally study? I'm just curious.
70315,I just went to a community college for wind energy nothing crazy. But it got me interested in engineering.
70316,"I'm in my second year of Psychology and while I love it, I'm slowly realising that I don't think I will make a good psychologist. I'm way too socially anxious for that to work. I wish I would've studied History, which has always been my one true love."
70317,"You don’t have to be a psychologist if you get a psych degree! For perspective, there’s people who go into medical school and other non-psych related clinical work with a psych degree. You don’t have to be a councilor either. Always feel free to change your major, but please know it’s not a one path career. If history is your calling, it’s not too late to switch!"
70318,"I wish I went for English or audio engineering. Instead, I'm stuck in psychology. Sucks to find out that I don't actually want a career in psychology, but I've sunk too much time and money into it to switch now. I'm getting my master's in English though, so at least I have that to look forward to."
70319,What made you realize you don’t want a career in psyc? I’m trying to figure stuff out and it helps hearing how others have gotten to where they are!
70320,"I took a class about psychology as a profession and learned that I would need to get a PhD or PsyD in order to really use my psychology degree for psychology (unless I wanted to be a mental health tech at a hospital or something, which is sort of grunt work). When I started looking online to apply for jobs with my new psychology degree, a lot of the jobs seemed really stressful and undesirable (low pay, unpaid training, etc.) at the BA or BS level. I aldo realized that I probably chose psychology in order to learn about myself and that I actually really don't want to be a therapist or a case worker or have any job where I'll be responsible for another person's health. I did a big research project that was really fun, but I don't really want to go into research because it was also stressful. A degree in psychology can be useful in many fields, so I'm thankful I will have a degree in psychology, but I don't really want to work in the field of psychology. I'm passionate about mental health activism and find psychology incredibly interesting, but I don't want the pressure of having to make those things a career.

When I first started looking at going to college, I really wanted to pursue English and creative writing. I abandoned that dream, though, because I was worried that I wouldn't be able to have a stable career, and my English teachers all recommended not getting a degree in English. This past year, though, I took a grammar class and a sociolinguistics class and LOVED them! I came up with a few ideas for some cool projects I'm excited about! I figure that I'll always be able to have a career in something I'm passionate about if I really love it and work hard. I can combine my knowledge of psychology and my love for English and specialize in sociolinguistics.

I'm also really interested in audio engineering/music production. I mix my own music and home and really enjoy it. I would love to be able to help other musicians bring their dreams into reality by producing a sound that's perfect for them. I'm looking into some audio engineering programs as well.

Hope this helps!"
70321,"economics, or maybe social work. im doing politics and i HATE politicians"
70322,"Oh you can do so much with political science! Public policy, serving communities..."
70323,"I have a poli sci undergrad and I don't really feel you can do anything with it. Maybe if the degree program has a practical side. Mine was heavily theory based, so other than sit around and talk about political theories I don't feel you can do anything with the degree by itself.

(I took a communications elective near the end of my degree program which would eventually give me a career path to follow.)"
70324,"There are a lot of jobs in my field (pre-law) that want that poli sci degree. There are tons of fields that want you guys

Then again, I'm not you and I don't know how your field works"
70325,"Lol as an Economics major, I don't even look at the suggested political internships, I hate politicians as well. I wouldn't mind working for the federal reserve though as an analyst though. But I'm not getting involved in politics as a career."
70326,Lol I used to want to go into science policy but realized I have zero patience with politics
70327,i have absolutely zero patience with anything now just because im so involved with dumb politics
70328,"Might have switched my math degree to a computer engineering with a math minor instead of vice versa. I would've left my psychology major and bio minor the same. Although I would've gone into a neuro program but I already had accumulated a significant amount of credits at an institution for which there was no neuro program. So currently I have psych, math majors and CprE, bio minors. I would've done CprE, Neuro/psych majors and math,bio minors."
70330,It’s be very easy to do an accelerated BSN once you graduate to be a nurse. But I would just also make sure it’s what you want - nursing overall is often thankless and even harder in a pandemic
70331,That’s true! The truth is I don’t really know what I want am that makes me very scared as I get closer to graduation. At the moment I am looking into post-grad fellowships and possibly the peace corps to get some experience before deciding to get a master’s (which I will need to get a decent paying job).
70332,"’m in the same boat, general science degree I don’t know what to do with, but I’m heading to nursing school next Fall."
70333,"That’s awesome! What type of nursing program if you don’t mind me asking (I.e ABSN, second degree transfer, entry MSN, etc.)?"
70334,"Thanks! My university has a dual degree program where as long as you finish the first degree (and nursing pre-reqs) in 3 years, you can transition to their nursing school for a remaining 2, and I got accepted! Currently busting my ass to finish this last semester of my current BS, and it’s not the ABSN or MSN direct entry route, but I’m okay with that since those are faster paced and the MSN option requires knowing more about what field of nursing I’d want a career in."
70335,"Medical Laboratory Science, but Currently I'm taking Physical Therapy. 
I really wanted MLS but we can't afford the tuition fee of that program. but I'm on a public university so I'm taking the program for free however we have to maintain a grade :(( 
but i really want to take MLS"
70336,Have you thought about taking out loans to cover the difference? I know it’s not ideal but at least you’d get the degree you want
70337,"If I had the funds and the time to double major, I would have added a BA in History and minors in Art History and Women's/Gender Studies (I took some classes in both but just didn't have the mental capacity for all of that in four years). My degree had a lot of requirements compared to some of the other degrees and I did 2/3 concentrations. I have a BA in Design with Interior Design and Architectural Design concentrations. I do not regret my degree but I am thinking of going back to school to get an MA in History."
70338,If money were no issue I would have studied History
70339,"Geography, specializing in Geographical Information Systems. Super interesting and those guys are making bank."
70340,"Geography is great, but if it makes you feel better my brother works in GIS and only makes $20 an hour lol"
70341,"Really? Wow. I took a job for a little while as basically a GIS assistant— I have some training from my earth sciences classes but I’m nowhere near certified, and I was making $25/hour."
70342,"A Teaching Degree. I have always been great with kids, most of my childhood, I was always the oldest. and I like to help people"
70343,"Getting a masters in education after doing something unrelated is something a lot of my teachers in my public high school did. My chem teacher worked construction and my algebra teacher was in business. My father is an elementary school teacher now and he got his bachelors in CIS/accounting. We don't have a surplus of teachers in this country, and if you have a masters in education your expected pay range will go up even higher."
70344,"i wish i studied marine biology, but knowing my mom she would say that degree would be useless so i took education instead and am becoming a teacher so she wouldn’t shame me"
70345,Teaching is a great degree for continuing education. Many schools will pay for you to go back to school
70346,Perhaps pure math. Granted I’m a physics major with a math minor so not too far off lol.
70347,Business Administration
70348,"US history, one of my favorite subjects in high school, wanted to become a history teacher but at the time didn’t want to spend so much time in school to become a teacher. now on my second degree 5 years in the cyber security and IT field looking to become a professor..."
70350,"I would say majoring sociology and then go to law school.

I decided against it because of the supply and demand.

A public defender only gets paid sub par and it's quite a righteous occupation, but I decided against it once again.

So I decided to Major in Biology and go to medical school. There will always be a demand for doctors and especially nowadays with this pandemic, COVID-19.

This really motivated me to help others and let them go on their way. If I can take their sicknesses I would, but all I can do is give my best!

I will be graduating this semester, Spring 2021 and will got to medical school after a gap year on Fall 2022. I will be taking a lab researching role and will study with the MCAT in the mean time."
70351,The last thing we need is more doctors who don't want to truly be doctors. It's hard frustrating work and it about helping other people survive and get by a lot of the time.
70352,"I totally agree. Who we need are people who live & love what they do!   


A doctor isn't just an 8-5 job, it's a way of life. People must remember that Doctors are part of the front lines who are willing to make the right call in the given situation. It's more than a grade, but a person who is willing to put others first and I am determined to.  


 I will remember why, because I want to help others and that's my reason I will persevere. I will give this all onto God and Christ and they will bear my strength into super human energy!"
70353,I could answer this with so many majors. I’m currently a biology major but I could see myself studying anything from math or computer science to political science or Spanish.
70354,"I wish I had done secondary education. I’m in my last semester as a double major in political science and geography, and I wish I had just gone the education route because now I know I really want to teach. I love my majors, but I’m gonna have to jump through hoops now to get certified in my state."
70355,"Tons of teachers in my district did something totally different and then switched to education for their masters, and I went to one of the best public school districts in the state. My chem teacher worked construction, my algebra teacher did business, and my father who works in the district as an elementary school teacher did accounting. I think they actually prefer teachers who did something different before, most students are not going to become teachers and having an adult that also went down that life path before switching is helpful."
70356,i wish i have the brain to study into STEM related majors like enviromental engineering. but sadly am not smart enough and went into a communications design major instead (it was my backup plan)
70357,"why think that way? STEM is hard for sure, sometimes harder for others, but those who do seem to naturally get it seem to often have a strong STEM background that they grew up used to. I’d say take the challenge. It seems daunting and you’ll study a lot but in the end it’ll all be worth it for a STEM degree.

Idk I just dislike seeing you put yourself down like that :("
70358,"As someone in a pseduo-hard science (environmental policy), i wish i would've picked up a minor or double major in GIS/some other spatial technology. i'm finding it hard to market myself since i have one foot in science & one foot in policy."
70359,"If money wasn’t an issue, I would have gone to study Zoology/Environmental Science/Marine Biology or Astronomy."
70360,"Computer science, I wasted 3 years majoring in finance to realize that programming is what I enjoy doing, I'm considering a minor in it to maybe get some sort of credentials to be taken seriously when applying for jobs."
70361,"Yep have a look into doing it as a minor, or even doing certifications and bootcamps if there’s a certain technology you’re interested in!"
70362,"I have been really into marketing ( and wish I majored in it), and I’m bummed I didn’t explore majors more and go in undecided."
70363,As someone who’s in college as undecided right now I can personally say you don’t get to explore as much as you would think
70364,"Cybersecurity, graduated with a degree in psych (which pays like shit) and went back to get certifications in cybersecurity. I. Love. It. I would go back and spend a full 4 years learning cyber in a heartbeat."
70365,Same just got sec+ and working on CISSP. Communications undergrad.
70366,Happy with my studies rn but i wish i was more smarter and know what I’m doing when i graduated HS bc i wasted my time studying CS i didnt learn or was my interest. I was only doing it for money. Then i moved and changed my major
70367,Im a chem major and I love it! Although if I wasn’t super shy I would’ve loved to start a YouTube channel a few years ago. I think it just would’ve been a fun thing to do and making some extra money from it (if possible) would’ve been a nice plus
70368,That's a cool idea! I'm not sure if it's the type of channel you wanted but I bet you could incorporate chem into your videos so you can do both? There's a lot of people who find chem and sciences interesting on youtube. I bet it'd be a really fun experience since it sounds like you love both!
70369,"Wow thank you! I’ve actually thought about making chem videos. I also love makeup and I’m actually hoping to work in the cosmetics industry if possible, so maybe it would be neat to make videos about both and how they’re related n such lol"
70370,"That sounds like a really cool idea! It'd be really unique to have two seemingly completely different topics in chem and cosmetics, but also show people how they're very connected! Plus, you can always go into specific subjects in each topic and be a combo channel with makeup and science. I say go for it!"
70371,"I thought so too... You’re so kind, I’ll definitely give you a shoutout if I blow up haha thank you!!"
70372,"Chem major here as well. I had started a YT channel back in 2018. It was a gaming channel. Got fed up of gaming tho so I got rid of it all. Still got 20 subs :p. 

I'd advise if its something u really wanna do then go for it. Come out Ur comfort zone. Depending on the bids you'd like to make, u could do stuff without u being in the vids. So slides etc. If Ur into animation include that as well. Whenever u start Ur channel. Just reply here. I'll go sub :)"
70373,"Studied biomedical engineering and wish I'd done pretty much anything else. Had to work hard as f only to realize I pigeon holed myself to one industry, and that industry prefers to hire mechanical engineers anyways"
70374,"Right now I'm a freshman and sharing your opinions, it's boring and demands hard working, so I will definetely switch, I like many fields, but yet this drained my energy, I've lost my spark, there's no longer any ambition. I feel lost and don't know where to switch. What are you doing now?"
70375,"Engineering, I love linguistics, don’t get me wrong, but I miss doing math and Engineering just seems like it would have been so cool."
70376,"Yooo, studying linguistics here. I kinda just accepted the offer because it was a safety choice. I didn’t get into business program but ya I fucking miss my finance lessons especially since I took some finance electives last semester. I feel like I’m not benefiting from linguistics at all"
70377,"I feel that, it took me realizing that I wanted to take the academic route to really start to feel like I’m benefiting and enjoying it."
70378,"What do you do with your linguistics degree, if I may ask? Just graduated with a similar degree and have no  idea what to do career wise"
70379,"Uhhh, in graduating this semester and planning on going to graduate school and heading toward probably the research and academic route, so I’m not sure I’ll be as much help. If you’re proficient in analysis the CIA and FBI, etc. look for individuals in Linguistics."
70380,Good luck guys!!!
70381,"Supply Chain Major here. Wish I would’ve double majors in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or History. I love history so much but don’t have the money to go to grad school and felt very limited with just a Bachelors in History. Don’t get me wrong, I love supply chain and I get to travel and do many different things which is great but I love learning about how things came to be."
70382,I took a GIS course as part of my environmental science degree but that isn’t a major offered at my school. I think we only have two GIS classes and one remote sensing one.
70383,Whats the job situatuon like for supply chain? I have a sister who is undecided and considered the degree.
70384,"i’m happy w my majors now, media studies and korean but i wish i had a chance to dabble in fashion design or fashion business more. but i’m happy w how things turned out. i rlly struggled a year ago w studying supply chain, not my cup of tea at all."
70385,"I wish I went for social work and continued my hs Spanish that I was quite good at by getting a Spanish minor. It’s becoming clear to me that’s what I’m meant to do now that I have my first degree. I fell for the lie that the only worthy degrees are STEM, have a degree in ecology with a geology concentration, even though that doesn’t play to any of my strengths. I’m still young and saving a good amount of money so I may just go back."
70386,English. So much easier for me
70387,English or psychology. It would’ve been so much easier for me
70388,Wish I went to a school with a stats major. Econ/stats double would have been perfect for what I want to do (academia) but I’m stuck with an “applied math” major that has one stats class in it
70389,"Medical Technology, to work in healthcare but avoiding patients."
70390,"Honestly after doing a music theory course, I wish I was doing that. I know it’s harder to make money in music than STEM, but the class didn’t make me want to cry so there’s that. 


Or queer/gender studies. I took a queer theory course last semester and that seems amazing"
70391,Chemical engineering. Granted I’m a chemistry major but a lot of what the Chem E do sound so fascinating
70392,"I wish I had stayed on the music path and not worried about making money. I would have loved to study music, I still sometimes wish I did. But, for now, History is fine. Maybe I'll go to a different university and study music there after this degree. Then I could play more quidditch, too!"
70393,wish i just majored in engineering or in comp sci for the high paying job
70394,Music. I studied software development instead and fuck it's miserable.
70395,Studying veterinary technology currently but I wish I went to a four year school and pursued a biology and or an environmental degree.
70396,"Medicine. I always wanted to be a doctor, but there's no way I will learn physics, without that, I cant study there so..I ended up in nursing school"
70397,"Probably some sort of media/journalism or film degree, or at least a more writing-intensive degree like history or english. It was my dream for a while to do writing/directing for magazines, newspapers, television or film or be a communications director for a company. I also liked the idea of production for any news shows. Obviously directing my own film or writing for a national paper like NYT, WashPo would be ideal, but I’d be happy doing corporate comms, PR or working more on the production/business side if it paid well enough. I took a lot of video editing, journalism, etc type classes in high school and also interned at a paper. I just really found the work fulfilling, especially when I didn’t necessarily need to worry about opportunities available. 

I’m still a freshman so I haven’t declared yet but I’m now probably going for stats/business analytics or finance. Not what I wanted to do but I can stomach it, and money :( Unfortunate because between the studying for the more math-y degrees and trying to secure work in that field, I don’t have the time to pursue any of what I liked before. I know they say “pursue something safe, do your creative stuff on the side” but it’s sort of a scam considering these days, you have to go full send on the backup career to make even that work."
70398,"I studied Political Science and loved it! Looking back I always had a slight interest in the sciences too, and wish I took a minor in Neuroscience to go with my poli sci studies (or even an Arts & Science degree, which is 2 minors with classes that help you tie your studies together).

Ironically enough, now that I've graduated I have a passion project writing on behavioural science & psychology in politics. So I still filled that gap!"
70399,Public health
70400,"I wish I had gone to culinary school, but the fear of not making it has deterred me from it. I also was kinda interested in being a vet, but I really dislike bio, so that was out of the question. However, I'm ok with what I'm currently studying, even though I still have doubts about it."
70401,"Information Systems. Its a STEM tech/business degree. I'm currently an Econ Major to late to change it now, I'm going to either minor or double major in CS. I think Information systems is more practical, with Economics I feel the need to compensate it a bit with something extra.

I didn't realize since Econ is not a business degree or a STEM degree, there is a lot less scholarships and grants available compared to finance."
70402,"English. Was too afraid to major in humanities, but the few English electives I took were the only instances I enjoyed learning/being at college."
70404,Investment 🚀
70405,"As a business major, I wish I would've trusted myself and studied economics. I'm minoring in econ right now and those classes are so much more interesting than my business classes"
70406,I studied geology (I love this subject so so much). I don’t necessarily regret it but now I work in biochem/analytical Chem and kinda wish I majored in bio or Chem to get a better background understanding on what I’m exactly doing.
70407,Not a degree. I’m currently working on my 2nd degree I wish I would of gone to trade school instead for welding.
70408,"Applied Math. I think the further I get into econ, the more I realize how applicable mathematical thinking is to everything."
70409,"I don't regret what I picked but I would have liked to learn about graphic design, animation, video editing and filming. With that being said, I don't think a degree is needed to learn this so I can do it on my own."
70410,I wish I had studied something that would have made me an astronaut
70411,"Accounting, had I actually taken it seriously, I’d probably be making good money right now."
70412,I wish I would have pursued the STEM to MBA program at my university. I am currently pursuing a degree in civil engineering but wish I would have known about the accelerated MBA program sooner. Now it is too late. I would much rather do technical sales and the business side of things than design/field work.
70413,Anything but medicine
70414,"I'm in comp sci and I sort of wish I went into **Geology**. I'm in my junior year, and I did the math and it would still be possible for me to switch majors and finish on time (while picking up a minor in CS from the courses I've already taken). I'd have to switch now, though, and I've taken too many of the hard CS classes to justify it.

I'd love to be a ""proper"" natural scientist.

Maybe a psych or philosophy minor as well. I'm not too torn up with CS, though, since I'm almost finished and it can open up even non-tech-related doors."
70415,"Culinary Arts. I'm currently studying business and I do enjoy some of the classes, but I still want to do Culinary School to see if I would have made it."
70416,"I work at a medium size marketing company (150 employees), only about ten people here have a degree in marketing.  Most of them are MBAs or English majors.

The best way to make your degree pay off is to not have to pay for it.  Any degree you pay for completely with scholarship money is going to be worth it.

The next way is to get a degree that doesn't cost much.

A vocational certificate in electrical, AC, or plumbing repair will give you a good paycheck for very little investment.

An associate's degree in nursing, dental hygiene, or radiology will also give you a good paycheck for very little investment, and better working conditions.

A bachelor's degree in engineering, accounting, finance, nursing (again), statistics, economics, or business.

A master's degree in pharmacy, physician's assistant, MBA, or any of the master's version of any of the bachelor's degrees.

PhD's aren't worth it if you are just doing it for the money."
70417,"I was told to go into business becuase it makes a person ""well rounded"".  Don't know how true that actually is though."
70418,"I did business administration with a focus in marketing (3 year course). 

It surely opens your eyes to some ideas and practices in the real world that is often overlooked or ignored by most people. It also gives a lot of context into news stories you read and hear about about various company's goings on. 

I certainly enjoyed it and it added a lot to ""who I am"" but I LOVE business and got more out of it than some I'm sure."
70419,"All the academic advisers and professors in the liberal arts use the ""well rounded"" excuse too. When I first transferred to my school this lady went on a tirade about how a liberal arts education is essential in today's world...because a degree in ""Minority Studies"" is going to land you 6 figures.

 Business is actually useful, but I would recommend specializing in an area like finance. ""Well rounded"" means full of useless information and a 4 year liberal brainwashing you're never going to need and that isn't going to do jack to get you a decent job."
70420,"Accounting. Want to own a business? Congrats you now can handle the book work and understand taxes along with business concepts. Want to work with the public and travel, congrats as well! Want to stay private and have an 8-5, congrats you can work in a corporate setting!

Many other benefits but Accounting is a very useful degree."
70421,"First, I'd say a BS degree is probably a bit more useful than a BA. 

* Engineering 
* Computer science
* computer anything
* something in health care ( I don't know any specific degrees)
* math

I think more recently business degrees are less likely to provide a quick 'in' to a good job. A LOT of people get them. so the market is saturated with business administration and marketing grads.

(for what it's worth I have a BA in anthropology. Wish I did comp sci)"
70422,"My understanding is that 'useful' degrees are those that generally result in a job upon graduation, such as(at least in my country):

Medicine, law, teaching, accounting, engineering, IT

As opposed to those degrees which have little job prospect and a surplus of students or are not specialised."
70423,"Business, Nursing, Engineering, CS/Information Systems all seem to be decent choices in my area. It definitely fluctuates though because I recently (again, in my area) a lot of teachers have retired and replaced by younger ones. These young teachers won't have to retire for another ~30 years or so. This makes the teacher job market a little rough."
70424,"You get out what you put in to any education. 

If you take art and go out into the world selling your talent freelance, or get your dream job at a museum/gallery, you've used your education wisely. 

If you go into accounting, a seemingly very practical course, and then go out into the world and do mindless office-drone work that has nothing to do with accounting, well you are much further behind than that art major you made fun of for 3 years."
70425,"Like 1 in every million artists even get a sentence mentioning them in the textbooks, so I think it's much safer to rely on accounting for a stable, albeit boring life."
70426,"Almost nobody in any profession ends up in the textbooks, it's irrelevant. 

My point is that REGARDLESS of your specialty, your ambition and dedication is what guides the ""usefulness"" of your education and your success in it, not the knowledge itself."
70427,"I equated being in a textbook to being famous, which would imply being financially well off as an artist. It is incredibly rare to have an artist living off of the money they make from being an artist."
70428,"If you are talking purely painting, sure, but you can make a good living doing freelance if you are dedicated - one of my friends makes excellent side-income doing nothing but painting in her free time - if she did it full time she'd be well enough off to live off of what she enjoys. 

But there's also art required in games, movie/music/indy posters, marketing copy, sign design, and anything with graphic design. Interior decorating is a common related field that is easy to transition to. 

You do not have to be famous to make a living in art. Look around you - I bet you are surrounded by things that required an artistic eye. Hell, I have a concert mug sitting next to me that didn't design itself."
70429,"Best: we have a 98% job placement rate at my school, and decent starting salaries .                         Worst: people mocking the major because it sounds weird, and people think it's easy.                                 Major: packaging science"
70431,"Packaging science is exactly what it sounds like, a major dedicated to everything packaging. At my school, we learn everything from packaging machinery, design using solids works and audios cad, to material science. Jobs are likewise very diverse; I know people working in packaging supply chains, making the big bucks in medical packaging, and even people working on greener packages. Packaging is the biggest industry no one thinks about, everything comes in a package."
70432,I always thought this job was pretty interesting. It's something everyone in modern society relies on without even realizing it. I considered it when I was in highschool for the insane job security.
70433,That's pretty cool.  I actually know a guy who works for a company that packages medical stuff in sterile one time use packages
70434,isn't that industrial design?
70435,"My school offers industrial engineering and packaging science and I will say they are different. Industrial engineers might work on machinery and distributions, but not in the chemical/biological/material side of packaging."
70436,"I sell online and packaging was surprisingly complex to me, theres way too many ways to optimize it that I just put the most stable thing together at times."
70437,CAn you explain the logic behind packaging everything? Especially stuff like fruits/ vegetables.
70438,"First of all, anything has to do with food packaging is a hassle. You always have to deal with marketing, and they usually have a huge say. For fruits and vegetable, expose to oxygen will allow them to ripen when needed. I know of packages that will control the amount of oxygen that comes in contact. Oh, and I'm more focus on the distribution side, so Im sorry if I don't have the best answers. Sorry for the late reply."
70439,Never heard of that.  Care to teach me what its about?
70440,View what I said to the person above. Thanks for being interested!
70441,Can you recommend or tell us the name of your textbook related to packaging?
70442,"We actually rarely use textbooks because professors     Usually come from the field with experience. Like one of my professors said, you don't need a generic textbook when I can tell you everything you need to know."
70443,"Can confirm, work in a package testing lab, everyone here was headhunted while still in school and from what it sounds like their college was awful lol.. just a high demand/low supply type of thing"
70444,"Elementary Education

Best: I get paid to have fun and be goofy. I love doing something meaningful. I truly believe kids are our future. 

Worst: “ThOsE wHo CaNt Do, TeACh! HaHAhAhAhA!”
But for real, people shit on teachers in the US. They claim to be all about them and support them, but they aren’t. I especially get crap for wanting to teach young kids and being male."
70445,"Honestly dude there's nothing more important and rewarding than educating the next generation, and it's annoying to see people hate on teachers."
70446,Thanks. I agree. I love education! It’s so fluid and constantly changing! It’s awesome!
70447,The world absolutely needs more of people like you
70448,You’re the nicest. Thanks!
70449,"I'm a math major.

The best part about my major is learning how certain results can lead to many other properties of mathematics. It's also quite fascinating how many different fields there are. Also in my specific program most of the professors and students are great to be around.

The worst part is trying to prove these results you learned in all of your classes are true. Sometimes it's straightforward. Sometimes its abstract and rigorous, and you can sometimes spend a really long time figuring out what to do. Upper division math is like this at the core, and many people really struggle with proofs and end up failing classes like real analysis and abstract algebra. But when you figure out a hard proof it's a great feeling."
70450,"Also when people ask
>Are you going to be a teacher?

and then when you say no (at least in my case) they follow up with
>Then why are you doing it?"
70451,"Or when some people say that the only jobs you can get with a degree in Mathematics is a teacher.

Also when they ask what specific job you want when there are so many jobs and so many different fields of mathematics that it's close to impossible to know what you'll end up doing."
70452,"My favorite response to
>-What are you gonna do with a degree in Math?

>-Anything I want"
70453,"Statistics

**Best**: You can play in anyone's backyard. The degree is super versatile.

**Worst**: (not for me but for a lot) You need to be talented in English and math. In all honesty, being well-rounded is more useful than being talented in one field."
70454,"Thanks! Been considering stats for a while. I have the english part, but I need to work on the math bit. How hard would you say it gets after the main calculus series?"
70455,"Adding more to the programming part, do get comfy with it. The better you can efficiently program stat stuff for data analysis, the more appealing you will sound. 

Also, data cleaning sucks."
70456,"It's the same as elementary statistics except with calculus; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time. Also, be open to do programming as that will give you even more job/internships opportunities. R and Python are probably the top two.

You can look up ""probability theory"" to see what calculus plays a role in statistics, that course is the toughest one for most Stats programs."
70457,"accounting

best: it's actually useful in your life, great flexible degree with lots of directions to take

worst: fuck it can be dry."
70458,"I took business major Financial Accounting I, and to date it's the only class I've ever taken where the instructor just constantly ragged on the subject for being boring.

It was actually kind of funny, but then also not because attendance was mandatory.  I watched a lot of March Madness and The Wire in that class"
70459,"Computer Science
Best is I love programming and do it for a living.
Worse thing is I dont like programmers"
70460,“Worse thing is I get an erection whenever I see a gender neutral name on an attendance sheet” ftfy
70461,Thank you!!! I totally agree
70462,Why don't you like em?
70463,"They always think they are better and that everyone else is beneath them.  They're cocky, arrogant, and self centered."
70464,"To be fair, we wouldn't have to act superior if everyone would just realize that we are better than them /s

Actually a CompSci major though, I haven't noticed this. Maybe I just dont get to know enough people."
70465,"I’ve noticed it’s in the people who think they’re ahead of the game because they took some class in high school. One year isn’t a lot in the long run, especially when we’re learning the same material at the same pace for the next 4 years"
70466,"Yeah, I had a year of C/C++ coding in highschool and while it did ease the transition a bit, I realized pretty quick that I hadn't even scratched the surface"
70467,"Same here, but with independent learning on an Arduino. I didn’t even know arrays existed until my first C class"
70468,Amen to that.
70469,"Going into the degree I figured even if I didn't like a lot of programmers its not a big deal because jobs are going to be mostly solitary and won't require a lot of team interaction.

Boy was I wrong."
70470,Sounds like something people really need to publicise. If it was well known how much group work was necessary in computer science the whole anti-social programmer problem might clear itself up...
70471,Omg I thought I was the only one who thought this
70472,Had to take two programming classes this past school year and I completely agree. Some of my classmates would often call to attention how much more they knew than the rest of us. I wasn't even really bothered by this until the professors started handing out pop quizzes and speeding up their coverage of the material because they began to think we were all that type of person. It really became that much more of a challenge for those like me who were new to all of this.
70473,I love my CS kinfolk! They're arrogant in the childish way that you almost want to believe half of the stuff they're saying.
70474,"Film. Worst: almost everything you do is a group project atmosphere. Best: learning about filmmakers, the filmmaking process, and the theory behind why each aspect of a film is important and its effects on the audience and the final product."
70475,My housemates are film students and they say word for word the same thing. That and apparently you don’t see all of your year group that often cos you’re stuck in small work groups most of the time.
70476,"Worse thing ? All the Chemistry Formal Reports 
Best Thing ? Mixing Chemicals with friends in the Lab or the statisfying feeling of solving problems.

Major : ChemE"
70477,"English here!

Best: Class discussions are incredible, reading materials are almost always fascinating, essay prompts are generally fresh and interesting and allow for you to write more creatively than in other majors.  Additionally, an understanding of how literature is created is helpful if you enjoy creative writing, and the skills you learn in English translate indirectly into many different fields.

Worst: God the career choices after graduation are awful, and there's really no room for error if you want to work within your field.  You can't go into an English major with a ""C's get degrees"" kind of outlook, because if you want to make it in this field you absolutely need to set yourself apart and give 110%.  You probably won't have much luck with just a bachelor's degree unless you flex your connections.  Even a master's degree might not get you very far outside of teaching, and you'll probably need a PhD to work in academia."
70479,"I feel the same way, but I seem to run into a lot of people who look like they're just in college to party and have a good time.  Not that I don't enjoy that, but my grades come first.  I live in America and I definitely feel like English (and a lot of other non-STEM majors) has really lost a lot of respect academically and in the world at large.  The work is definitely not as easy as it might seem!  As far as jobs, it's definitely true that the skills you learn in English apply all over the place.  It's tough (I hear) to find a job directly related to your field, but that's not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."
70480,"Genetics Major here! Best: More specific than a general biology degree. Developing field with a wide variety of potential applications. 
Worst: Don’t get into “genetics” specific classes until late sophomore year / early junior year (makes it hard to switch majors if you end up hating it). Everyone expects you to go to graduate school."
70481,Biology. I fucking love biology! Worst: job market and funding (I want to be a professor).
70482,"Best: it's an extremely versatile path, with virtually no cap on upward mobility. Business majors are never ""tied down"" to one path and you can bounce around from different careers quite a bit and still keep all of your experience as relevant-- like if I wanted to go from say, advertising to product development, market research, or even something totally left field like event manager, I can do that without raising any eyebrows (which is a *really* good thing for job security and for all that money you lose by not changing jobs somewhat regularly).

Worst: stereotyping. People tend to simultaneously think business degrees are easy/business majors can't hack it in other fields, yet also think business majors have some weird like ""evil mega corporation"" thing going on. Like c'mon people, you can't make Weyland Yutani by being an idiot!"
70483,Im just now getting into college for business cause Im just trying to be able to sell my own art. When I tell people Im selling out to mtself they seem to change their attitude into thinking im stupid or a genius and all other things go out the window
70484,"I just try to keep a (hopefully somewhat self aware) sense of humor about it. I go to a Catholic University, so when I pull the ol' ""I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven"" line out, it usually gets a little chuckle. Most people don't think the Catholics appreciate humor, but it's worked for me so far. And if my core friend group gives me a good ribbing, I just quote MSI to them ""I'm gonna conform. I'm gonna play ball. I make a sacrifice, because I want it all ^^awee-oo-weeoo!"" 

And like, yeah, we're not directly curing cancer or anything, but when someone does, how are they going to get their drug to market? Through us. Or people like us, anyway."
70485,"Physics/Maths

Best: Always interesting and always challenging. 

Worst: Insane workload. 3 years of it destroys a lot of people, and terrible mental health is normal."
70486,History. Best thing is you get to do lots of interesting reading and it really changes your perspective on the world and how it works. Worst thing is there’s no real clear career path after you graduate. It’s either academia or nothing.
70487,"Not if you market yourself correctly. History and other liberal arts degrees can be very versatile if you can apply the skills developed through the degree tract. History majors have to take broad concepts and make sense of them through writing. Or take very specific concepts and make sense of them. Extremely useful in a number of worlds, including but not limited to business and politics. 


The thing is though, it *does* require taking extra steps. My school has 3/4+1 options with the history degree and the MBA program. An MBA with a history degree is more interesting to employers than an MBA with a generic business admin undergrad degree. 


Want to work in politics? History is extremely useful here, as it applies well to the concept part that I mentioned before. 


Doors to employment in public affairs, communications, HR, law and writing jobs all exist with a history degree. 


Of course you can go into academia if you want to, but history majors actually outperform business admin majors in the business world *once hired*, and there are plenty of routes that are open by applying learned and developed skills. 

Outside of academia no one will care about the impact of Hoover's agricultural experience on his decisions while in the Oval Office, but employers will like that you have demonstrated the ability to take in  complex information, and make sense of it in a comprehensible way."
70488,"Law school. You’re right about that. That’s actually my plan. Great write up by the way, hadn’t considered the MBA."
70489,"I’m a history major and I’m lucky enough that my school has a public history track (okay, it’s one extra class, but I’ll take it). I’ve never met anyone else who is on this track and we have an overwhelming amount of us who are on the education track instead (as in becoming middle or high school teachers as opposed to going into academia). It’s definitely not advertised that there are other options within the field."
70490,"Finance. 

Classes in college are easy and the jobs pay VERY well. 

Cons. The jobs first out of college require a lot of hours"
70491,Another con is the sheer amount of finance grads there are.
70492,"Eh. Go to a decent school, get a 3.7+, go to networking events, and don’t be a jerk. You should come out ok."
70493,"Theatre major (BA, not BFA/conservatory)

Best: 
- I love my classes
- it’s a small major so I get a lot more opportunity for one-on-one teaching
- I get to spend time with my friends
- I feel challenged both academically and creatively
- performing arts is one of the top 5 fastest growing job markets of 2018 according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Worst: 
- people assume it’s a super easy major and look down on me for it
- seniors take underclassmen major’s spots in classes just because they want an “easy” class to fill out their schedule
- all the professors don’t get along
- things get very dramatic during audition season
- we have no funding so all of our classes take place in the lobby of the theatre"
70494,"Major: Advertising/Public Relations

Best: Fun classes, small class sizes (it’s a limited access major at my school), lots of internship opportunities in my city related to my major

Worst: Low pay in both fields unless I work my ass off (and even that won’t guarantee anything), and people telling me I’m in a “fake” major lol"
70495,This is what my internship is in right now! (English major) It's a huge learning curve but it's so cool to see how campaigns are developed at every stage.
70496,Gotta love that “fake major” crap. I just think the people who talk like that don’t know a thing about higher education.
70497,"Poli-Sci major here!
Best: I’ve learned a lot, I’m always up to date on current events, I have a deeper understanding about how our government & other governments function

Worst: Mansplainers, close minded people who discredit you, the constant question of “oh what are you going to do with poli-sci?!!?”"
70498,retweet. Plus the major is filled with people who chose it because they like to argue and hear themselves talk as opposed to find consensus and collaborate.
70499,Also people who act cliquey and like high school never ended!
70500,Isn’t that basically politics in general?
70501,"No, most people are actually interested in finding solutions or agree on the ends and not the means. It's just that vocal 10% that won't shut up or hear anyone else out."
70502,Mansplainers?
70503,[Mansplaining Explained ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining)
70504,"**Mansplaining**

Mansplaining (a blend of the word man and the informal form splaining of the verb explaining) means ""(of a man) to comment on or explain something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner"".  Lily Rothman of The Atlantic defines it as ""explaining without regard to the fact that the explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman"". Author Rebecca Solnit ascribes the phenomenon to a combination of ""overconfidence and cluelessness"".

In its original use, mansplaining differed from other forms of condescension in that it is rooted in the sexist assumption that a man is likely to be more knowledgeable than a woman.

70507,"Computer Science
Pros: I adore programming and the creative and logical aspects.
Cons: Women in CS tend to be less respected."
70508,"This is anecdotal but the few women in my CS classes were much better programmers than the average dude. Do you feel like people expected less from you? Curious because I have a little sister who I'm encouraging to go into programming, any advice?"
70509,"My professor has stated that I'm exceptionally promising. I think for me, it required really putting your code out there. You gotta fight a bit harder to make sure people really take you seriously. But I've been fortunate in working with an astounding CS professor who really treats women and men fairly."
70510,That's good to hear. I would imagine it really meant a lot to hear that from a prof. Keep up the grind✊
70511,It was amazing. I hadn't even considered doing CS before my Dean basically shoved me there (long story) so his words really reassured me it was the right path.
70512,"Haha, I was an EE major but in my first CS lab I drew a picture of knuckles from Sonic using javaFX. The prof gushed how he used to play sonic with his son and showed me a bunch of emulators. Ever since then he would make an effort to show me interesting stuff that was out of the curriculum. He gave me no choice but to switch to CS. Also, does your dean serve as an advisor?In my school, you only talk to them if you're in trouble."
70513,"They don't, but they have to authorize transferring to different majors outside of the college. I was originally an engineering major going into math, but she practically forced me to stay in the information and engineering college under a CS major"
70514,">forced
umm why?"
70515,I'm a student in the honors college at my university and they use honors students like currency; the more they have the more bargaining power and money they get. So she wanted me in her college.
70516,"dude, this is totally offtopic but that's a tight-ass name.

I'm not in stats or anything but still"
70517,"Thanks! For some reason, stochastic processes tend to sound incredibly bad ass. My other favorite is 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo'."
70518,"Well, I never majored, but I did my BA and MA in history. I think the worst thing of both of them is that people don't take history seriously, and consider it unemployable (which is hilarious because I've never been without a job in my field since I graduated with my BA, even if they're all temporary). The best, though, is that history is my passion and I could not have enjoyed my education as much in any other subject.

I'm currently doing my PhD in human studies, which is an interdisciplinary social sciences and humanities program, and the worst for that is similar to that in history: people don't always take interdisciplinarity seriously, if they even understand what it is. Another is that people also don't know what ""human studies"" is and don't usually understand what I study. The best, though, is that I can continue doing history, but I have the benefit of blending it with other disciplines (so my research is primarily historical but also partially sociological)."
70520,"Well, last summer I worked full time at my city archives, for one. That's a government job, too, since libraries and archives are government run where I am (and both libraries and archives love to have historians). Historians are often regularly employed in museums. There are also many non-history jobs that value historians due to the skills that a history degree gives you - research, critical thinking, data analysis, etc. - but if you're looking specifically at history jobs, then libraries, archives, and museums ought to be your first thought.

I almost ended up working at a local museum this summer too, but instead have been working for my thesis supervisors on campus (which gives me much more flexibility as it's rather independent)."
70521,What do you mean you never majored?
70522,"I chose to specialize instead. It means doing more classes in your program and less electives. You have to minor if you major at my school, so I specialized so I wouldn't have to minor."
70523,"English: 

Best: I don't have to do math or memorize rules - it's mostly based on interpretation and discussion.

Worst: Everyone likes to brag about the ridiculously obscure books they've read - turns into a literary pissing contest."
70524,"Fashion Merchandising Major Here!!! 

Best: 
Wide Range of Jobs from Retail Management, Fashion Accountant, Fashion Buyer, Editor in Chief of Fashion Magazine, Wardrobe Stylist etc.

Worst: “Oh so you design clothes?”"
70525,Fashion design major here! Sometimes people tell me I should have done something more useful like merchandising haha
70526,LOL!!
70527,"Wasn't that what Elle Woods majored in??? So you have a shot at Harvard Law, just tell people that"
70528,"Broadcast Journalism

Best: my school has one, soon to be two, TV studios where we can get experience right away either as talent or in the control room

Worst: it's so so so much work especially for reporting. Finding an interesting story with an interesting angle, to setting up/coordinating interviews, getting good sound bites (especially if the interviewee is as dry as an Arizona summer), to the absolute worst part, editing. A good 45 second to 1 minute story can take as long as 3 hours alone to edit."
70530,"I'm absolutely enjoying it. My first broadcast class I went into I knew I picked the right major. It's just the amount of work outside of home and at school after classes that I find annoying, but for the most part I don't mind at all. It's just one big grind."
70531,"I have two as I switched majors recently, first

Environmental Studies: Pros: Its nice to work related to the environment which I respect, I got tons of respect from people who did also, and the classes are interesting. 

Cons: Im a first generation and my entire family thinks I am wasting my time because they never heard of it, the pay for a job seems to be less than the other major I wanted and more education needed.

CIS Pros: I can likely get a job with a AA degree at a school district and I love technology.

Cons:Ill likely be asked by family for any computer problems forever."
70532,"Technical Writing/Interactive Media Production major

Best: Potential jobs are very in-demand (UX/UI Designer, Technical Writer, etc), I get to double-dip with the extended major into TW and IMP classes, not a lot of reading required, but not a lot of math either, and it’s in a STEM field. Also, there are enough upper-division credits to not need extra classes on top of the major. 

Worst: There aren’t really any bad things I can come up with at this point."
70533,"Major: Philosophy

Pro: Phenomenal preparation for all the jobs I've had so far. Builds really strong analytical and writing skills. Surrounds you with very intelligent other majors in your department.

Cons: People love to talk shit about it without understanding what they are talking about"
70534,"Best thing I can choose my own path
Worst thing I have no fucking clue what my path is"
70535,What’s your major?
70536,The jokes is *I don’t know what my major is*
70537,Oh lmaooo I thought u were like a business/interdisciplinary  major or something from the way I read it
70538,"You mentioned the word 'joke'. Chuck Norris doesn't joke. 
Here is a fact about Chuck Norris: 

 >Only Chuck Norris shuts down websites without due process, not SOPA or PIPA."
70539,"Graphic design major

Best: I love developing new ideas and flexing my creativity. Potential career field is looking pretty good. The major allows me to develop my portfolio with guidance from my professors. Rarely take tests or quizzes.

Worst: Professors grading your work can be pretty subjective. ""Oh, so you're an art major."" Also you either pay for Adobe Creative Cloud yourself or you go to the library all the time to get work done."
70540,"Linguistics: the best thing is how many other cultures I’ve gotten to experience, the worst thing is that it’s such a broad field of study that just because someone else is studying “linguistics,” they could have a vastly different focus and skill set."
70541,"Interior Design Major.

Best: Development of concept work and seeing an idea come alive

Worst: Having to stare at the screen for 15+ hours"
70543,whats your major?
70545,"To be more specific, here are the highest paid undergrad degrees:

1. Comp Sci / Software Engineering
2. Electrical Engineering
3. Petroleum Engineering
4. Mechanical Engineering
5. Industrial Engineering

Of those, only comp sci / software engineering isn't extremely heavy on math.  And you still need to be able to do some math to get through the program, plus to be any good at it you need to be able to think *very* logically.

Law / Business yea, but that's not undergrad.  Law is getting crowded, yes.  If you go to a good regional school and get top 10% or so in your class you'll do fine.  But that's not undergrad.  So, same concern as psych there, that you'd need more schooling (professional school not grad school, but same deal)."
70547,"Lmao, no hope at all huh. Ok if I wanted to go to grad school does that change anything at all? I seriously suck dick at math and all sciences but bio and environmental"
70548,"I think your biggest problem is that you are setting yourself up to be bad at math by repeatedly saying and affirming you are bad at it.

Math is hard, not for most not fun. *But literally anybody can learn it with enough effort.*

As a guy who was ""bad at math"" and avoided math for a whole degree, hated his job, then went back to school into a math heavy program and succeeded with the proper effort, I'm telling you it is possible if you really want it.

Think about your real, honest experience: did you grind for hours doing practice problems? Did you get a tutor? Did you go to every single class, and regularly take your questions to the professor's office hours? Or did you get frustrated, do the bare minimum, and declare yourself ""bad at math""?

Here's the hard pill to swallow about hard academic subjects, the ""smart"" people very likely are not any smarter than you, *they're just trying harder*."
70549,"I guess I really am not trying hard enough. Thanks.
If you don't mind, what did you end up hating and what did you go back to school for?"
70550,"Had liberal arts degree, could only find non-career admin-type work and it totally sucked. Went back for compsci degree, now software dev. Still sucks a decent amount but the money helps"
70551,"Most academical studies can be achieved by the average person if the person tries hard enough.

In addition, if you care about money, understand money at the end of day is simply trading of numbers (supply and demand). Hence, being good at math generally gives you a comparative advantage for higher pay. It does not help that most careers in demand also happen to depend heavily on math itself (since more mathematically focused careers tend to have lower supply for its demand).

As a note, higher level math is not just numbers. Don't be afraid. Math is the study of logic and reasoning through constraint creativity. You might just end up liking math, who knows.

Also, as a general rule of thumb, things people hate tend to pay more. Likewise, things people love or have easier time doing tend to pay less. This is just supply and demand on a nutshell. So just avoiding anything ""hard"" and expecting results generally does not work out well. And this is especially true for fields that people relate more to with ""difficulty""."
70552,Fair enough. Thanks!
70553,"I'm an engineer and business owner. We do a fair bit of science and math. There's a reason math-heavy careers tend to command $100k+ salaries once you're established in the field. If you're not skilled enough to handle complex math, that kind of limits your options, and when you want to know which career gives you the best opportunity to get a higher salary... well... that's probably the one you'd want.

Don't panic, though. You can still earn over $100k per year in other ways. In terms of lowest barrier to entry, being a really good salesman can drive your total compensation into six figures; this works across multiple fields, too, so you can pick what you are good at selling (houses, swimming pools, kids toys, etc.). Most attorneys have decent earnings, but they do require additional schooling and passing the Bar. Medical school is difficult and expensive, but it's another path. Perhaps the best way to earn $100k+ annually without a degree is to invest about $2.5m in a diversified portfolio; but, you'd need that amount of liquid assets first."
70554,"Thank you for the info! I'm leaning towards tech or business, seems most fitting for my goals"
70555,Obligatory 'money doesn't buy happiness' I understand you want to support your family but this is your life we're talking about.
70556,"I know, but I am the only one in my family going to college. Barely anyone works, and I get all my undergrad fully covered by tuition. I don't want to waste time on a degree that won't help me financially, but I'm also afraid to do something I know will benefit me if I'm no good at it because if I get bad grades my financial aid is gone and I am done for.. so this is really important to me tbh"
70557,"You can find careers that pay that much but if you’re not effective it’s not going to last. Then you’ll be stuck with a degree you don’t care for and it’ll be difficult to correct. 

Find what you’re passionate about. At least a field that excites you. I hate to sound like a jerk, but it doesn’t sound like you can coast through college and still pass. And that’s not a bad thing! For me, I slacked off on classes because I didn’t care.  Once I finally found a major I loved, classes were easy because I wanted to learn more about it. Now I’m in a similar field, not making what you want, but that wasn’t my original goal."
70558,Thanks dude. I'm actually doing pretty good in school right now with straight A's believe it or not. That's only because I have no hard science or math classes though
70559,"You can go into software sales with your psychology degree. Just gotta be good at bullshiting and networking. 

You can also do cyber security insurance underwriting."
70560,Really? How? Wouldn't I need grad school for cyber security? Would they seriously take my undergrad psych degree?
70561,"Insurance underwriting is very easy and you typically don’t need a specific degree if you get involved in insurance clubs in college and go right after college to one of their trainee programs. Companies like CNA, Chubb, The Hartford"
70562,"Get a trade, if you're bad at math and science it seems to.me your options are slim unless you want to go into nursing or geology. Welders and millwrights can make well over 100k if they put in the time."
70563,Geology almost 100% requires grad school to reach the salary OP listed.
70564,"100k? No, if you're in exploration geology and put in the time you absolutely can once you get your P.Geo."
70565,Nursing doesn't sound too bad. Thanks
70566,"1) Nursing entails math and lots of science (biology and chemistry, specifically--it all deals with the human body and the medicines to help treat it).

2) Don't become a nurse for the money. If that's your sole reason for doing it, you'll be a shitty nurse. Nobody wants to be (or have a loved one be) in the care of a shitty nurse."
70567,There's also the fact that anyone that goes in to nursing purely for the money is going to burn out in 5 years unless they coincidentally turn out to love it.
