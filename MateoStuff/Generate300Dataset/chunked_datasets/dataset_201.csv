66454,"Mexico has been playing moleros? Idk, past few friendlies have been vs decent/good teams"
66455,and have been looking pretty good against them too. hated when weâ€™d play teams like barbados and think we were world cup winner contenders.
66456,"Worst team we played was Guatemala back in September, but given that it was the first match to be played after the Covid breakout it can be forgiven they couldn't get a better team. 

But after that yeah, some solid teams, Netherlands, Algeria, South Korea, and Japan."
66457,Morelos is Colombian
66458,I always wonder how we (Tunisia) are always that high..
66459,Afcon semis and recent world cup group
66460,Friendlies.
66461,"Team isnt good on paper but the results you produced was exceeding expectations during the last few years. In other words, exactly the contrary of Morocco and Egypt."
66462,sidi mehrez
66463,"Wales 18th, wot"
66464,Bale played a good match so fifa updated the rankings
66465,"A lot of Welsh players play better for Wales than their club. Bale, James, Ramsey and co. turn up. 

Hal Robson-Kanu was doing Cryuff turns to score against Belgium."
66466,Fair cryuff turns do give you at least 5 extra rankings
66467,Adam Lallana's thoughts exactly
66468,How long til we can expect that for us
66469,That was like 5 years ago.
66470,point still stands that Welsh players seem to play their best football for Wales
66471,Is that too high? Weâ€™ve won a lot of games recently against decent opposition as well
66472,"Wales are doing really well atm considering the historically low expectations for them. Here's a list of their results: https://www.faw.cymru/en/wales/results/

Unbeaten in the Nations League with 5 wins and a draw, putting them top of their group. Only one goal conceded, as well."
66473,Itâ€™s mad that they think Poland is the 19th best international team in the world. Every time I watch us play itâ€™s like a Sunday league team with 1 good player up top. Madness.
66474,"No one thinks it, the world rankings are all numbers and data, so in that regard the machine is saying, there is no thinking involved"
66475,"The machine is not coming up with the algorithms by itself, at least I hope so."
66476,"On the other hand, a IA that only wants to manipulate algorithms to favour Poland sounds preferrable to other options."
66477,Good GK too?
66478,"It's based on data, and thanks to good results from 2015 to 2018 we are still high. Realistically we should be below Sweden, Senegal and Ukraine (they're way better than what their position suggests). Maybe we'll get better under Sousa."
66479,"Polish coaches are brainless, the best generation of players absolutely wasted. Hopefully we can make a statement in the next couple of tournaments before Lewa retires."
66480,I can't believe we actually made it but fuck it we'll take it ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·
66481,Idk how either our attack is decent but our defense is made out of wet paper bags
66482,*desperately prays for Kim Min Jae to go to Europe and develop into a cornerstone for a solid defense*
66483,I heard he was linked with lazio and Tottenham. Hopefully he gets a a move to Europe
66484,We're ahead of you. The last time we reached a World Cup was last millennium.
66485,"HA! Take that, Czechs !!! Not even in the top 40, you nerds. Slovenskooo"
66486,"4krÃ¡t som to musel skontrolovaÅ¥, Å¾e naozaj sme tam a ÄŒesi nie. Lmao. Lets gooo ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°"
66487,Nice Mexico is at 9th. Hope mexico gets into the top 8.
66488,"you could say they already are in top 10, look at the bright side bro"
66489,I am looking at the bright side. I said it was nice that rhey are in 9th. I just want them to be top 8 since that would make them a first seed team in a group at the world cup.
66490,"need to be top 7, because Qatar will be the other first seed"
66491,Your right. I forgot about Qatar.
66492,My rightness is a course sometimes
66493,"oooo, did not get that, my bad bro"
66494,"No way Poland is above Senegal, they fucked us sideways in the world cup..."
66495,It's true but that's not how the rankings work. Everyone knows fifa rankings really don't reflect quality.
66496,"By definition teams under CAF will get fewer points than teams under UEFA for the same performance, as CAF teams have a lower coefficient."
66497,"We (Switzerland) have really dropped since the 4th place in the Nations League in 2019. We were consistently ranked somewhere around the 8h place im the ranking, our performance have been quite shit over the last few matches.

Lichtsteiner retiring hasn't really helped us either, we lost a quality leader with him. Not sure if Petkovic should stay much longer to be honest."
66498,"Switzerland plays better than the results show in my opinion. Defensive mistakes and not having a clinical forward are the drawbacks. Seferovic got his god mode on in that incredible match against Belgium, but he's no Lukaku or Lewandowski."
66499,"Part of our 'decline' can be accredited to the change in our tactics and system over the last few months, I think we look better than before, yet our results are worse somehow. 

I've been hoping for a proper forward since Frei and Streller retired, it's the position we lack most besides wingers. Mehmedi and Gavranovic are shit, Seferovic is mostly shit, Embolo can't go to the grocery store without getting injured and promising players like Itten can't really get into the squad.

One thing that bugs me is the lack of passion some players seem to have (not talking about singing the hymn by the way, I wouldn't either).

Players like Senderos, Magnin, Spycher Lichtsteiner are on a different level than some of the planks walking on that pitch today. Surely we have more quality today, but we lack the players who would go through hell for the team."
66500,"Sorry, but I don't think that Itten is it. He was good at St. Gallen, but now is mostly a backup player for Rangers. Ajeti does better at Celtic for example. Still, Seferovic scored more than both of them this season so far, and the portuguese league is way more competitive than the scottish one."
66501,Letâ€™s be honest the old ranking was partially a result of gaming the rankings by playing friendlies against sides you knew you could beat. Nations League shone a light on the true level.
66502,Bruh how are we number 1
66503,WC third place and doing well in Friendlies maybe? Idk I would have thought France would be top but Belgium have a great team too
66504,"France got to the 2016 finals and won 2018. They topped this Nation's League group, so probably friendlies count too much toward this"
66505,Belgium won almost every game since losing to France whilst France lost and drew some. The current model used by FIFA is quite close to ELO so the Friendlies actually don't weigh that much in the formula
66506,Playing in friendlies actually hurts your ranking. Itâ€™s beets to do too many subs so the same doesnâ€™t count and doesnâ€™t hinder you. Always scheduling friendlies against the right teams. Certain countries have somewhat gamed the rankings before to get themselves higher seeds. I think Switzerland might have.
66507,Is that still true since they changed the way they calculate the ranking?
66508,"Imagine conceding a hattrick to fucking Seferovic and still being number 1

BelgianThings"
66509,"Texas in 17th, America is really taking over"
66510,IM FUCKING MISERABLE
66511,so is our national team
66512,"SOY CELESTE! SOY CELESTE! CELESTE, SOY YO!"
66513,can't believe my little country is at 26. bit proud ngl lol
66514,"It's not that little when you compare it to most European countries, they mostly have around the same population on average."
66515,how are we 31st... feel like Algeria is always super low in this rankings even after winning AFCON
66516,Because we didn't qualify for the World Cup
66517,I love how Russia beat Spain (#6) and is still #39 while America didnâ€™t make the World Cup and is #22.
66518,Itâ€™s been 3 years since the World Cup
66519,Someday Davies and David will drag Canada into the top 40.. Someday
66520,Having anyone ahead of France is a joke.
66521,recent results though
66522,Surely Portugal should be above England?
66523,Slotted in nicely between Morocco and Algeria... Great work philosopher GÃ¼neÅŸ
66524,Does 21 not exist?
66525,There is a tie for 20th place probably. Thatâ€™s why 20th comes up twice.
66526,Ahh got it. Thanks
66527,Sweden and Senegal tied for 20th
66528,"Sweden and Senegal have same ammount of points, so they're both at 20th"
66529,Fifa takes the game of twenty plus one very seriously.
66530,Brazil being 3rd place absolutely amuses me. It shouldnâ€™t be that high honestly.
66531,"With Tite Brazil lost only one official match, while being extremely unlucky. In the last few years they won the Copa AmÃ©rica and beat Argentina and Uruguay, among others."
66532,Scotland should be there
66533,"Doubt it. Were pretty poor in the qualifiers, lost a couple of nations league games and I doubt we picked up many points in the play offs."
66534,Yeah I was only joking. Weâ€™re 48th right now but after 6 wins in the Euros we should be looking pretty
66535,We need more Aussies
66536,*visible confusion*
66537,"Who the F is the one in charge of this graphic?

Some has the top gradient glow(Belgium), some has no gradient glow(Germany), some has edge glow(Italy), some with super low resolution without any glow(England), and some with 'glow' effect that's covering 60% of the imagine(Morocco)."
66538,"Lmao Romania on 37. We're objectively worse than all 3 teams under us and the first 10 above us would probably 5-0 us any time easily. We're beyond trash. We should be 50+ not 37

."
66539,Colombia 15th lol
66540,thats okay I don't like football anyway
66541,Glad to remember we came back into the top40. 31st rn and Im only hoping that with another successful AFCON we can challenge where we were in 2014
66542,Wow cool were actually in the top 10. Number 9!
66543,Feel like the netherlands should be somewhere in the top 10
66544,Nah our games under de boer has been trashh
66545,The results were mediocre at the start but itâ€™s the best football weâ€™ve played in the last 5 years.
66546,Wasn't any better under Koeman though was it? We have been laying like shit for years.
66547,Germany's hitting a new Low I see.
66548,I think it makes it even worse knowing Australia only misses this list by one place. At least if weâ€™d been further off I wouldnâ€™t have gotten my hopes up.
66549,25th!!! VAMOS PERU!!!!!!!!!!
66550,I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ve seen us play recently lol
66551,LOL! Lets not talk about it. Lets just be happy that we are here.
66552,Hahaha. Thanks lads.
66553,Wales in #18
66554,10th place baby!! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
66555,Shoutout Scotland
66556,Can't believe we are that high
66557,Always reminds me that Franco fucking Foda is wasting our golden generation. Oh the things we could achieve with a this squad and a good coach.
66558,I hate the FIFA rankings but I guess there's not really any other better way to do it
66559,Anybody else enjoying putting a country to the flair in this thread?
66560,How the fuck we're number 32? We finished last in national league. Is it because we finished second in European Qualifiers?
66561,France not in first place... Lol
66562,"So happy to be in the top 25, hopefully we can win the regional tournaments and get a good world cup spot. 22 is a great number for 95% of us no little to nothing about soccer/football"
66563,African teams absolutely shafted here
66564,FIFA rankings are such a joke. ELO rankings are way better.
66565,argentina is either 5 spots too low or 10 spots too high depending on whether they can sort their defence out
66566,"No idea how the Swiss, the US and Austria are ahead of Ukraine. Ukraine won their group for Euro qualification and was in pot A for Europa League with a big win over Spain. Pretty sure they tied Germany as well. They should be where the Swiss are."
66567,"Clubwise there are a few...

**Milan 1989** Maldini, Baresi, Costacurta, Gullit, Ancelotti, MVB, Riijkard.

**Madrid 2001** Zidane, Hierro, Carlos, Makelele, Figo, Casillas, Raul.

**Milan 05/07** Maldini (Still) Nesta, Gattuso, Pirlo, Kaka, Seedorf, Inzaghi, Cafu. Shevchenko, Crespo Stam..

**Barcelona 2009** Messi, Eto'o, Henry, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol, Abidal.

If either Barcelona or Real Madrid win the UCL this year, they could possibly be added to this list, especially offensive wise.

International

**Brazil 2002** Cafu, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Kaka, Ceni, Carlos, Lucio, Dida, Juninho, Denilson. That squad was ridiculous.

These are the ones I can think of off the top of my head, feel free to say anymore."
66568,"I'd go with the 2004 Real Madrid squad in terms of name value at least - Zidane, Ronaldo, Beckham, RaÃºl, Figo, Roberto Carlos, Michael Owen, Walter Samuel... My brain couldn't comprehend it at the time..."
66569,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2g2j07/greatest_champions_league_squad_from_the_past_20/
66570,"Uh... what's the word... Real... Madrid? I think? .-.

Their bench can easily win titles in another countries."
66571,but their starting XI can't win the title in their own?
66573,"Well, Turkish Superlig, maybe."
66574,"The ""new"" galacticos or the ""old"" galacticos?"
66575,Barca 2007-12
66576,"The list also leaves out the more recent Milan side that won 2 CLs and lost a final to Liverpool alongside winning the league and Club World Cup. That side was definently a top 20 team, 2002-2007 ish."
66577,"that team is top 10 easily, perhaps even higher. Sure only one scudetto isn't good enough but in europe they dominated and annihilated so many teams obviously other than that liverpool fuck up. Only Arsenal 02-06 have played more enjoyable football in my adult lifetime in my opinion."
66578,"Yep, that team had one of the strongest XIs of all time too. Maldini-Nesta-Stam-Cafu-Seedorf-Gattuso-Pirlo-Rui Costa/Kaka-Shevchenko-Inzaghi to name the standouts."
66579,"Exactly, with backups like Costacurta and Crespo. Fucking Juve, Milan should've won so many more scudetti."
66580,"True that, fuck Juve :D"
66581,100% agree on that AC Milan team. Literally had 2 Ballon D'or players on it. Plus a stacked midfield and defense
66582,"The United team of the late 90s/early 00s was excellent, but they only got to 1 European Cup final. How are they better than the Inter Milan team of the 60s, who got to 3, and won 2? Or the Benfica team of the same era, who won 2, and got to 5 finals?

They were a brilliant team, but they don't deserve to be so high up this list."
66583,"I'd also argue that the United team from 2006-2011 was better as they reached 3 champions league finals winning one of them and also won 4 out of 5 Premier League titles. The like of prime Rooney, Ronaldo, Tevez, Carrick Scholes, Vidic, Ferdinand and van der Sar were the core of the team!

Great article though!"
66584,"That 90's United team did win the treble mind, first team in England to do so, so i kinda get why they went for the 90's team."
66585,Yeah that's a good point! One of the my first fondest memories was watching that late at night as a kid staying up past my bedtime!
66586,"My dad is a Manc and and I fondly remember him nearly giving my dog a heart attack when Solskjaer scored. While me and my brother (both Liverpool fans) just sat there thinking ""of course they've fucking done this, bastards."""
66587,Bloody hell a United dad and Liverpool kids that house must have been like a war zone
66588,The Inter Milan team in the 60s got 2 European cups but they literally got them through cheating so that doesn't mean much
66589,Evidence?
66590,Paisley's Liverpool is underrated.
66591,The Barcelona side that won 6 trophies in a year should've been number one..
66593,Why does the Liverpool side stop at '83 as they kept on winning trophies throughout the 80s?  Turnover in the squad?
66594,"United 06-09 > United 98-01 

I prefer this [list](http://footballpantheon.com/2011/05/the-50-greatest-european-club-sides/11/). It's better researched. Although do bare in mind it's from 2011."
66595,the guy stand to the right of platini wore longer shorts than platini....so its not like those werent available during that era. what was the rational for those very short shorts though?
66596,"Santos is way too low, how are them behind Celtic and Benfica lol"
66597,Worst list ever!
66598,It's pretty decent but you know beforehand most people would make a different list.
66600,Seemed like the list favoured long-term dominance. I guess they felt that team all went their seperate ways too quickly.
66601,"Just a heads up, whining about downvotes is normally a great way to get more."
66602,bs list
66603,This thread is going to be delicious to browse soon.
66604,"Depends what you want, if you want to watch your team steamroller all opponents then one of the two main Spanish teams (barca and real). But that's no fun, knowing your team is going to obliterate anything before it (sure there are a few slip ups) is pretty boring in my opinion. The fun is in the tension, the highs when you win as the underdog, the fight to avoid relegation to a lower division. I'd recommend one of the mid level English teams, Everton, Tottenham, Southampton, Swansea. There's a good level of banter amongst the fans, there's more passion"
66605,"Like I said, I'm a Chicago fan, so we're usually teams with great tradition that are underdogs. But we'll pull out great runs. Anyone like that?"
66606,"I'd go for Southampton, they seem to be everyone's second favourite team in England. Have a terrific academy and just keep churning out fantastic young talent, Walcott, bale, oxlade-chamberlain, lallana etc. They sold most of their squad last summer, were seen as definite to be relegated, but with a fantastic manager have been toying with the prospect of European football most of this season as opposed to relegation."
66607,That's silly.
66608,What's silly?
66609,"This is a bit like choosing a girl to fall in love with, it's hard to engineer. I'd say you should watch a few matches and see if you suddenly catch rooting for one side rather than the other. That being said, I'll give you a run down of the biggest clubs. Note: I don't really have a clue what I'm talking about, and apart from this, nothing I say should ever be taken seriously by anyone.

* **Real Madrid**: has won 10 Champions League titles, more than anyone else. Their fiercest rivals are Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. They sign big names, galÃ¡cticos, and have one of the biggest fan bases in the world. Also, [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDPVBprjFo), the world's best player in 2013 and 2014. And you can't really go wrong with James, Isco, Modric, Bale, Ramos, the little pea or the central defender prodigy that is Varane. Top three in both team quality and club size. 

* **Barcelona**: as of right now, perhaps the best team on the planet, their run in the last months has been fantastic. [Messi, Suarez and Neymar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeRThkiCK7E) in attack is almost like cheating. This team would be more top heavy than a woman with giant breasts and small everything else, but their defence is almost as solid as the attack is good. Top three in both team quality and club size.


* **Bayern MÃ¼nchen**: won the Champions League two years ago, along with the Bundesliga and the German cup, completing a treble. The biggest German side, they have a formidable history. They've got [top quality players all over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhBnkyt7-o), and a lot of players from the German side that won the world cup. Not to mention a [keeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIGqcIYvq6M) with his own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/justneuerthings/) Top three in team quality.


* The fourth team I want to mention is **Arsenal**. Famous for their optimistic and [fluid football](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16uyix_arsenal-vs-norwich-4-1-jack-wilshere-s-goal-of-the-season-hd-720p_sport). You can count on them to always get to the knockout rounds in CL and they will [always almost go through](https://www.google.no/search?q=arsenal+almost+champions+league&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=JX9HVYLgLoWasAHKz4GgDQ). Rivals: Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and 15 more London clubs.


* Then you have **Manchester United**, easily one of the most recognizable clubs in the world and the most successful English club. Struggled last year after the great Sir Alex Ferguson retired after nearly thirty years as manager. With the [eccentric Dutchman Louis van Gaal](http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/05/21/british-journalists-follow-these-ten-rules-for-interviewing-louis-van-gaal/), they are in a good position to qualify for next years Champions League. Top three in club size. Rivals: Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal.


* The second most successful English club is **Liverpool**. They have a great history, and I hear they'll have a great side next year.


* While Serie A is in a bit of a rough patch right now, there are still plenty of great teams in Italy. **Juventus** just won the ""scudetto"" for the 31st time, making them the most successful Italian side. With players such as [Buffon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY9t8n2b_w4), [Tevez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEwgKAPow9w), [Pogba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMxPphrgeu8) and [Pirlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkyC9ZdHjaU) it's no wonder that they won. 



* But wait, there's more! Even though they're not that prominent in the US (yet), **SK Brann** from Norway is a club of high quality and mediocre values. Except for a minor setback with relegation last year, Brann is now en route for coming third in the highly acclaimed OBOS-ligaen, thereby securing the right to enter a qualification cup with the teams in 4th, 5th and 6th where the winner will face the club that ended at 14th place in Tippeligaen. So you can say it's getting pretty serious. If you start now, you'll be joining on the way up and that's way more fun than jumping on the bandwagon when we win the Champions League in 2019.

Look at all I've written, and I have still neglected several great teams such as Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, PSG, Lyon, Ajax, Celtic and Roma. And I have failed to mention several good leagues.


TL;DR it's up to you, buddy. And we all know what you mean by ""soccer"", don't worry about it.



PS! Bayern will face Barcelona and Real Madrid will face Juventus in the semi finals of the Champions League soon, watch those games. Additionally, Chelsea will face Liverpool next week, and Arsenal after that. Manchester is going to square up against Arsenal the 17th. 

Edit: formatting."
66610,Barcelona
66612,Because Messi is the hero we all deserve.
66613,"Name recognition, due in part to being the only worthwhile team in La Liga. 

Plus, *everyone* knows either Messi, Neymar, or Suarez (only because he bites)."
66614,"A few million Real Madrid fans will violently disagree with your opinion. Not to mention, some Atletico fans."
66615,"To which I'd respond by telling them to look at the past two decades of La Liga.



Annual Winnings: 

FC Barcelona: **8**  ('12-13, '10-11, '09-10, '08-09, '05-06, '04-05, '98-99, and '97-98)

Real Madrid: **7** ('11â€“12, '07â€“08, '06â€“07, '02â€“03, '00â€“01, '96â€“97, and 94'-95)

Atletico: **2** ('13â€“14, and '95â€“96) 

This pretty much knocks out Atletico. 



Obviously, Madrid and Barcelona are pretty much even, but for a newcomer to football, I'd say Barcelona has been more relevant in recent years."

Just watch football and you'll see which teams you like and which not. I think ""being a fan"" doesn't work by basing your ""love"" for a club on facts or titles someone tells you.

You like Balotelli? Watch Liverpool and see if you can't miss a match of them after that.

Or watch Bundesliga and be impressed by that brilliant team from Berlin in blue and white with their little flag as logo.

Just watch it and have fun, the rest comes by itself."
66631,"You're right. I jus think it's more fun following a team, especially with such a long season."

66649,That was my pacman vs black guy fight.
66650,[Liverpool](http://youtu.be/XlP9KGjqXf4) or [Borrusia Dortmund](http://youtu.be/JQsmnulp1Do).
66651,"Real Madrid. Sport it's about enjoy, not crying out every sunday coz your team been defeated onve again.."
66652,be a fan of the Italian national team or Liverpool (Balotelli's club)
66653,"If you like Balotelli, then Liverpool"
66654,I like 1 EPL goal this season
66655,That's nice
66657,a joke of a club
66658,What's this soccer thing?
66659,"Since your in Chicago, Manchester United. You can relate to most of the fans of United as well, since most of them aren't from Manchester."
66660,"well since they are the most widely supported club on the planet its pretty obvious MOST of the supporters aren't from Manchester, doesn't take away from the fact that probably 3/4 of Manchester is red.  And yes i am from Manchester and yes im a United supporter."
66661,I don't really wanna be a front runner tho. I'm not a bandwagon fan.
66662,"Stade Rennais. Just kidding, french first league is only exciting to french people.

Well if you don't want to be original, Real Madrid or Barcelona. If you want to do big teams but ""less original"", Bayern, ManCity, Manchester United, Chelsea, PSG, maybe like Juventus, Atletico Madrid."
66663,"I was thinking ManU, bcuz they're owned by Americans. But I guess they're like the Yankees of soccer. I hate the Yankees. Chelsea jus won Premier League and I don't wanna be a front runner."
66664,PSG is a French team.
66665,I know I'm french. They were not that bad.
66666,"I agree, they just lacked a little something this year in CL. It seemed weird to me that you mention them because you said French first league is only exciting to French  people, a fact i'm not that sure about.... but you might be right..."
66667,I don't really consider them the same as other french teams. They win because they have a lot of money.
66668,"Obviously Hansa Rostock.

They had Turboneger as their stadium hymn."
66669,"For their population, that's very impressive for Croatia and Serbia"
66670,"Yeah, Portugal and Belgium deserve a shout out as well."
66671,Belgium a little.. literally this is their only promising generation in their history and still might not win anything.
66672,We're at the tail end of it. Sad they never won
66673,"Super fucking hard to win titles om the international level even with great players though. There'll always be 3-4 other teams ranked around your level plus a further 4-5 that can beat you on a good day, not to mention the additional handful of sides that might very well take points off you if your team aren't going at 100% on matchday.

That's without taking into account that even the biggest superstar of a team is unlikely to play more than 6 or 7 tournaments over his career. You don't get many opportunities."
66674,Add that you only get a few chances with a generation at their prime. A 6 year window of players in their prime gives you 3 chances. And itâ€™s not like the competition is a bunch of scrubs.
66675,Unless you're Italy of course.
66676,Same can be said for the Dutch twice (although at least they won the Euros)
66677,"Not really because Netherlands consistently has had good squads since the early 70s. 3 World Cup finals, one of the best Euro records in the game and won it once. Belgium has/had a golden generation but before that they were straight poopoo for a long time. Cannot compare the two nations"
66678,"The Dutch have definitely been more consistent, but theyâ€™re widely regarded as being â€˜the best team to never win a world cupâ€™ and it feels like they had two generations with a great shot and just couldnâ€™t get it either time"
66679,"Iâ€™d say four generations with a good shot:

1. Mid 70s (Cruyff)
2. Late 80s/ early 90s (Dutch trio)
3. Late 90s/early 2000s (95 Ajax)
4. Late 2000s/ early 2010s (Robben, Sneijder, van Persie)"
66680,"That late 90's might honestly be the best one, but is probably the most forgotten one due to missing penalties, people think about Ronaldo's Brazil and Zidane's France, but I genuinly think the Dutch team was the best those years, the strikers we have at the moment would struggle to make the top 10 list of Dutch strikers those years"
66681,"To be fair it is super hard to win an international title, even with a ""golden generation"" you only have a few chances, it definitely requires luck as well"
66682,There's always 5 other top tier teams at any give tournament so you're looking at best 1 expected trophy during your golden generation
66683,"They medaled at the World Cup and look pretty happy about it:

https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3565545.1531586204!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/ratio_1x1_w1200/image.jpg

Funny that we think of a bronze medal as being pretty good in Olympic events, but somehow you are shit if you don't win the World Cup.

I think Belgium did about as well as they could've. I suppose on paper they had the weapons to win a big one with KdB, Lukaku, Hazard, etc, but on the international scene you are just going to run into those huge nations like Spain, Brazil, Germany, and France who have the same infrastructure for development and a much bigger population. It's not impossible (see: Greece, Portugal), but the margin for error is razor thin.

I think Belgium can be proud of what they achieved."
66684,I still remember Spain in 2010. Their games were all very tight 1-0 wins but they got there in the end.
66685,">literally this is their in promising generation in their history and still might not win anything.

Hungary: *First time?*"
66686,They won an Olympic gold atleast.
66687,"People said the same about our NT between 2000-2008, but the unfancied, boring 2016 was the one to win. Labelling them a golden generation just adds extra pressure."
66688,what makes it all funnier is your current squad is probably stronger than the 2016 one too. So you guys won a major title with probably your weakest team in the 21st century.
66689,"Their golden generation is pretty much over, none of the defenders are up to it anymore and by the next world cup most of the rest of the team will be done too."
66690,You donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll be solid for the next World Cup in like 14 months?
66691,"We'll make the quarters then lose a close game to some team who have a better defense.

And that'll be that, we'll look back fondly at the best footballers the country ever had but will never get rid of the lingering ""what if"" , especially the wc semi final.. if we had reached the final I'm sure we would have won the whole thing, Lukaku and Hazard/KDB would've dominated in those circumstances."
66692,"You'll come to terms with it eventually. We were really close to beating Brazil the semis in 94. A lot of people thought ""what if"" for a few years but since then its been considered a peak achievement for us."
66693,"There were always better teams, so it's not surprising."
66694,But Serbia are eternally shit in tournaments.
66695,username checks out
66696,What tournaments
66697,All tournoments
66698,need to qualify for tournaments to be shite in tournaments :/
66699,We sure donâ€™t perform like the 11th most valuable team
66700,"It's worth keeping in mind with Croatia and Serbia that they often draw their players from their diaspora population as well as their local population. Some examples which spring to mind are Ivan Rakitic and Milos Veljkovic who were born and raised entirely in Switzerland, but due to their parentage, and presumably a strong sense of identity with their parents' homeland, opted to play for Croatia and Serbia respectively. It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason. Still very impressive for them, either way."
66701,"good point. just this week you'll have sucic and stanisic making their u21s debuts, kids born and developed in Austria and Germany."
66702,"This is a rather new trend, Croatia made semis at the world cup in 98, Serbia & Montenegro had a strong team in 2006 & 2010, with players like Vidic, Kezman, Ivnovic, Kolarov, Stankovic & Krasic (who fell off a cliff after a great year at Juve)."
66703,Croatia made the semis in 98 not 94
66704,"Kezman was kinda struggling by 2006. Still led the line for Serbia & Montenegro and I think top scored for them in qualifying, but he wasn't great at club level. He had a minor revival at Fener and then just faded away. Massive shame. One of my favourite players at PSV."
66705,">It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason.

Croatian diaspora is 1 million at best. So instead of 4.5 million there's 5.5 million to look at. Still less than 10% of the populations of Germany, England or France. Hardly misleading."
66706,"Yeah, I don't know why people like to so strongly exaggerate the size of emigration from Yugoslavia. Of course it exists, but in terms of national football teams it doesn't play some game-changing role. It's not some main reason why these countries have so many talented athletes.

The guy said ""often"", and then he gave two examples. One is RakitiÄ‡, true. The second one is VejlkoviÄ‡, who played like a few games for Serbia in 2018 (and adds 4,5 million in this table). There is a lot of ex-Yugo people raised in German countries, but it's not something completely changing their football team."
66707,"Yes, Especially when you take all other sports into account. Tennis (Djokovic and others), Basketball (5x World champs, a dozen Euro champs), Watepolo (world and Olympic champs for decades), Volleyball same thing. And more."
66708,imagine the possibilities of a combined (former)Yugoslavia
66709,Yugoslavia would be worth 1bn if you get the gang back together.
66710,Luka Chad JoviÄ‡.
66711,Jesus Haaland is worth half of Norway
66712,"Imagine how much His Father, God Haaland, is worth."
66713,"To us, heâ€™s priceless"
66714,Even The Haaland Ghost is worth a few kroners.
66715,A Roy Keane tackle?
66716,">Jesus Haaland

I read that in my head as Hesus Haaland. Was wondering whether there's a Spanish or Mexican version."
66717,"Serbia being there is a surprise, looks like they really underperform based on the value of players"
66718,Serbia would be much better if their national team management wasn't a complete fucking joke.
66719,"It doesn't help that barely anything has changed structure-wise in our football since like, the 90s. Add the ever-persistent criminal presence in our football into the equation and it gets even worse. We literally only rely on raw talent to get by, and I think that our inadequacies in terms of development and coaching will keep biting us in the ass more ferociously with each following qualification cycle."
66720,"SMS, Vlahovic Kostic, Milenkovic is probably like Â£150M themselves"
66721,JoviÄ‡
66722,Not according to Lazio
66723,They've always been high in these value estimates. They're always about there with Croatia. They're just underperforming massively last 10 years.
66724,Last 20 years*
66725,Last 30 years*
66726,"> looks like they really underperform based on the value of players

I mean, England is in first place lol"
66727,It is the market value. The market for English players is just different. Ferran Torres with an English passport would have been a huge transfer but since he is Spanish the price was only 30M or so.
66728,Also because he came from Valencia
66730,How does it look now? Any better than a year ago?
66731,Can say the same thing about Brazil
66732,This England team has got to the semis and finals of the two most recent major tournaments. Don't think it's fair to say they've underperformed
66733,If you want to see underperform in the two most recent major tournaments you have to watch us...
66734,"Even if England win the next WC, the joke of us being shit in sports that we invented is so ingrained in internet culture, that people will still be saying it.

Besides football, and I suppose rugby, we're having an absolute golden era across loads of sports, but still people take the piss"
66735,"Part of that is just down to how young the England squad is. They had the second youngest squad at the Euros, 2.5 years younger than France"
66736,Yeah and we narrowly lost the Euro final on penalties after a World Cup semi final exit. Not sure this current crop of players (which the value here represents) can be criticised for underperforming. Give them another 2 or 3 tournaments and judge them then.
66737,"Suddenly England reaching a final is underperforming, even though youâ€™d have been laughed at for predicting theyâ€™d get that far before the tournament. Keep moving the goalposts."
66738,If Yugoslavia was still a country it would dominate Europe
66739,Roman Empire is laughing
66740,That would be an interesting squad.
66741,"I think the best European player not to be able to make the squad would be Lewandowski, but he wouldn't be missed. That's just how good that squad would be"
66742,"Hard to complain about Lewy when your striker options are Kane, Benzema, and Immobile.  But if we want to be strict about place of birth, we lose Ronaldo too.  The Romans were certainly aware of Madeira but don't seem to have ever established a presence on it.

We can have a front three of Salah-Kane-Mbappe, as well as a midfield with Kante, De Bruyne, Verratti, and basically whoever we want from France/Italy/Spain.  It's definitely far and away the best national team that would ever exist."
66743,They would be more competitive for sure but they wouldnâ€™t dominate.
66744,If benelux was a country it would dominate europe
66745,If the EU was a country if would dominate the world
66746,Pangea FC when?
66747,"I'd probably have fancied South America with Messi most years but Cristiano so good in big games and one weak spot on the South American teams would have made it like 3-1 for the EU in World Cups he was around for.

Africa intriguing on the break, maybe squeaks a semi-final one year at home and loses in the final."
66748,Frenkie de Jong - De Bruyne - Wijnaldum midfield.... bruh
66749,"Hazard - Lukaku - Depay

        De Jong - De Bruyne - Wijnaldum

    Wijndal - Van Dijk - De Ligt - Dumfries

                    Courtois"
66750,Shit full backs still
66751,Serbs-Croats-Bosniaks-Montenegrins speak the exact same language and are genetically basically the exact same ethnic group. Constantinople and Rome and Istanbul successfully played with their identity to the point of no return.
66752,Doubt that.
66753,Doubt
66754,"We do, past 9000 years.

We always have better team on paper than results actually show. It's like there is no culture to play for your country, but to come back from clubs to visit some night life with colleagues :)"
66755,English tax coming in clutch
66756,"England does have a lot of valuable players now who. Gomez, Maguire, Trent, Walker, AWB, James, Shaw, Rice, Phillips, Mount, Hendo, Bellingham, Foden, Saka, Sancho, Graelish, Rashford, Sterling, Tammy and Kane. There are still plenty more who are worth a bit."
66757,">England does have a lot of valuable players now who. Gomez, Maguire, Trent, Walker, AWB, James, Shaw, Rice, Phillips, Mount, Hendo, Bellingham, Foden, Saka, Sancho, Graelish, Rashford, Sterling, Tammy and Kane. There are still plenty more who are worth a bit.

Gomez, Phillips, Tammy, AWB and the like would hardly be as valuable if they weren't English.

Some of those players are undoubtedly brilliant but others are considered better than they are because they play in a league which is generally watched more"
66758,">Gomez, Phillips, Tammy, AWB and the like would hardly be as valuable if they weren't English.

I know you're just commenting on these players because they mentioned them, but it's worth noting that all of these (except Phillips) didn't get called up, so their value is irrelevant for the graphic regardless"
66759,I get your point but Gomez would have 1000% been called up had it not been for injury.
66760,"I fully agree, although if it wasn't for his injury then his value would also be higher"
66761,Idk if thatâ€™s true considering we ( a non PL team) just paid 40 mil for Tammy and heâ€™s been great so far
66762,"you bought him for that price ALSO because he's english

even if he flop in italy there'll be a low table team wanting him back in PL"
