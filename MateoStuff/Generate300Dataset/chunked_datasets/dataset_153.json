56856,"I've been throwing up between the Dell S2721QS vs BenQ EW2780U for a display to go with my 2020 M1 Macbook Air. They come out to a really similar price at the moment (\~$500 AUD), as both are on sale. I want a multi-purpose monitor mostly for uni work (I study software engineering), but also watching TV and some light gaming (games like stardew valley). I might also hook my switch up to it."
56857,"Lenovo G27Q-20 or AOC Q27G2S?

Both are IPS, 1440p and 27”. Lenovo is 165hz while AOC is 155hz. Which one is better? Or any recommendations? My budget is within the price range of these monitors. Thanks"
56858,"I really need help picking between 21.5 (22) inch and 24 inch monitors for my dual monitor + laptop setup (the laptop will most likely be used with the lid closed). In either case I would go with BenQ GW__80 monitors. I received the 24 inch model yesterday and while the monitor themselves are absolutely great I can't help but wonder if 24 inch dual monitors is a bit overkill. They take a large footprint on my Ikea Malm desk. Maybe getting arms or a stand would help? Anyway, because I'm so unsure, I also ordered the 22 inch model this morning.

What do you guys think? What has your experience been with dual monitors of various sizes? Keep in mind, my setup up until yesterday was a 17 inch laptop on a stand next to a 21.5 Samsung TV on a stand as well."
56859,"Hey, I'm currently owning a Benq GL2460 ( https://www.benq.eu/de-ch/monitor/home-office/gl2460/specifications.html ) and now want to change my setup by stacking to monitors on top of each other.

My question is, wich monitor should I buy?

I'm very happy with the Benq one, should I just buy the same one again? 

(My budget is more or less 200€) 

Thank you for your help!"
56860,"LG 27GL850-B vs Gigabyte M27Q (or maybe something else?)

Looking for monitor that will be little bit hybrid for PS5 gaming and connecting with gaming laptop etc.

Any advice?"
56861,"Hi, Benq ex2510 or Msi Optix MAG251rx, which has better color, is there a difference between 8bits vs 10bits? the frequency does not interest me.

I was looking for a monitor with certain specifications, if anyone knows of a model that meets this specs I would appreciate it very much!

24 inch, 144hz or more, ips, 1ms gtg, 10bits native or frc

I only found 2 monitors: Msi Optix MAG251rx and ASUS ROG Swift PG259QN"

56863,"Hi, I have a shitty 5 year old laptop(with poor color accuracy) and little money in my bag.

I frequently edit photos and frankly it's too much work on my phone. 

I'm looking for a monitor that serves ONLY the purpose of photo and video editing. I'm in the lookout for an IPS panel, 22/23/24 inch size, and HIGH Color accuracy. I have come across some that offer 72% NTSC. Will it suffice? Do i need more NTSC than that? (Sorry noobie here)

Compensating for buying a new machine with a color accurate monitor and a SSD for the laptop.

Please advice some monitors, will be grateful forever!"
49192,"[This one](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/asus/) from asus is awesome. It's right in the budget too (actually, I found it to be cheaper than a lot of the other monitors I was looking at). No 4K tho AFAIK"
49193,"I mean, I'd pick the [LG 27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850) any day. Such a beautiful screen."
49194,"Tbh, last IPS I got from LG looked like shit. Grainy and visible vertical lines at max refresh.  Still have it because I could not return it.

I had an Acer also, for a short period before returning. That was some kind of horror movie. Huge discrepancy in brightness between upper and lower part of the screen.

A monitor can be quite expensive and manufacturers pass intentionally subpar panels on the market because they are labeled as ""gaming"" and that's supposedly the main feature. A convenient excuse.

I don't have the time and will to hunt for a good unit. So,  with LG and Acer I have personal experience they slip garbage on the market. Never gonna buy from them again.

I will trust Dell/Alienware. Never had a problem."

There's probably a million more but I got bored."
49198,Wth are you rambling on about?
49199,It's pretty self explanatory.
49200,If it was I wouldn't be asking.
49201,"Click the links until you find one that isn't deleted, the comment I replied to was similar. All spam accounts link farming bullshit ""top x"" sites with amazon affiliate links."
49202,"holy guacamole, thank you for this research"
49203,"Don't know much about other brands, but I have a BenQ monitor and the color accuracy of BenQ's IPS panel is truly amazing."
49204,"Make sure it has some sort of BFI tech if you're going to play competitive FPS games. It makes a world of difference IMO. 

Some of them have wide color gamut. Some people love it, other hate it. 

If you're going to work with text VA is not the best choice."
49205,"this is the exact monitor I'm looking for, rn the G7 seems to be the best of the bunch, but apparently has the G-sync flicker issue... really disappointed there hasn't been more chat in this thread"
49206,I got the Dell 2721 for $405 and loving it. I think it's the best monitor of the bunch right now
49207,It's $224 now you still loving it I need to buy one?
49208,Yes it's a great monitor. But I don't think your looking at the right monitor. cheapest it's been is like $380 to my knowledge
49209,Hey! was wondering which one you went with and why
49210,Here is my final build; https://pcpartpicker.com/b/xLK48d
49211,"Went will Dell 2721. Got it for about $404. Just seemed to be the best overall. After reading reviews and what others were saying I rank them..Dell, then Lenovo Legion, then all the LGs. All of them are very solid and seem to have good quality control. I like the 165hz on the Dell and the colors seems to be solid as well. It has a nicer design and stand than the Lenovo. LG overall isn't as speced as good as the Dell or Lenovo but still very similar.

There is also an MSI monitor that has gotten some attention as being really good as well but not a ton of reviews on it. That said, from what I have heard it is really hit and miss. Bad quality control on it. And seems like a risky buy right now. ."
49212,Wow! I'm going to go for the Dell 2721 if I can get it as a good price likes yours. Where'd you find it at 404? Ill check out that msi monitor. Thank you for the quick response
49213,MSI here: https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcmonitors/comments/keyh4k/msi_optix_mag274qrfqd_owners_impressions/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
49214,Dell for$400ish here..read comments for 12% off coupon. I got it for $450 - 10% off. https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/keb5s2/monitor_dell_s2721dgf_270_1440p_165_hz_414_10_off/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
49215,"I know this is old, but was looking through it and went with the Dell..they have the 2721 for $330 right now which is a great price for anyone still looking.

[https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf/apd/210-axeh/monitors-monitor-accessories](https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf/apd/210-axeh/monitors-monitor-accessories)"
49216,wow the timing of your comment couldn't have been better! Thank you!
49217,Stay the fuck away from Acer is my only advice. I got burned twice by their shit monitors and even worse by their customer service.
49219,I got the LG 27GL850 and very happy with it! also you can not really go wrong with any dell
49532,yea it's basically everything about your experience.  I just fucking lol at some of the 3090 at 1080p comments on here.  So you spend all this money to play on a shit tier monitor?
49533,"It also survives multiple upgrades. There's no chip slot incompatibility or anything like that. A good investment imho. 

As long as you buy them at the right time. And I think this is a great time to get an IPS monitor."
49534,"Hasent been my experience and info would be to the contrary. Rtings did pretty extensive testing and yes, if you watch CNN 24/7 you'll get dimming of thr most used colors(often red & blue) but as a monitor running different software throughout the day, I'll take the low risk. Just take advantage of the software help, and keep a Screensaver."
49535,"I'd say the 1st most important component in a pc is what's between the chair and the monitor.

2nd most important would be monitor, keyboard and mouse."
49536,Yeah... 120hz and up is insanely nice but chasing that fps in every games has become an obsession for me lol
49537,"Yep, a good monitor is a game changer. I LOVE my [LG 27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850), looks gorgeoussss"
49538,"There is no point in having a powerful PC if you do not have a monitor to actually see the performance... it is essentially bottlenecking your computer in a sense to use a subpar monitor.   


The monitor is a fundamental part of a PC... it should not be ignored."
49539,"Personal opinion, which Twitch pro gamers will disagree with: the improved colour accuracy and vibrancy of an IPS display is way better than the (possibly) faster response time of a TN.

27"" 1440p 144Hz IPS is an absolute sweet spot right now as the prices have come down drastically over the last few years. You can get good examples for as little as $300 USD compared with $500+ a few years ago."
49540,"Yep, I paid $1100 CDN for my Acer Predator 144hz 1440p gsync monitor in 2016. The technology is only just catching up now."
49541,"Yes, because that's why people fail, lower response time.

And I doubt any pro gamer is winning due to TN either, he'd win either way if he's better."
49542,"It honestly irritates me how people fall into this ""I need a TN for the faster response time"" like a 2ms faster response time is what's going to *ever* be the difference.  Any quality monitor is going to be more than good enough as to not have a measurable impact."
49543,VA would be the perfect panel if it didn't ghost
49544,"That's the thing about LCD technology - there isn't anything that would be perfect. You either get the low contrast of IPS, or the ghosting of VA (unless you have the cash to spend on Odyssey G7 which has unbelievably good overdrive)."
49545,VA is still the closest thing to perfect though
49546,That's why I went for the Odyssey G7. IPS glow and poor blacks are not for me and with the G7 you're getting high end TN response times in a VA.
49547,My Viotek GN27DW doesn't ghost if you set it at 144hz refresh rate. Can't say for color though since I'm a bit colorblind
49548,"I've settled for VA. Got 2 laptops with IPS and when put next to my VA monitor at 100% brightness, the blacks on IPS at minimum brightness are still noticeably brighter. I play a lot of games that involves day night cycles, and washed out dark colours can be impossible to correct causing issues seeing objects at night.

VA does ghost, but at 60hz it's not noticeable unless you drag black frames on white background. In games I don't notice it. Can't say anything about 144hz though.

I also have a smaller TN 144hz monitor, that one is worst to be fair. Viewing angles and darks suck badly."
49549,"Idk man, 27"" 4k 144hz nano ips makes me kinda wet"
49550,"Depends what you use it for. Modern games can't push 144 fps at 4k.

If you play some strategy, moba, or things like that, then sure.

Or if you don't game and need it for something esle, sure.

I got a second monitor, 4k 60hz becasue I cheaped out.

It's a productivity monitor for work, I'll be coding on it."
49551,"With reasonably high PPI, you can just render below native resolution and upscale."
49552,"I agree... BUT... I do not game competitively. However, expensive IPS monitors these days have fast response times."
49553,I got lg 27gn750 like 2 days back from amazon for aed 1150. Ips panel with 1ms g2g and 240hz. Its a great budget monitor if anyone is looking.
49554,"You are going to have to convert that to freedom, if you will."
49556,Oh I was referring to the currency. I was obviously just kidding.
49557,I just had literally no idea what you meant
49558,Oh haha fair enough.
49559,Why sooo lazy?
49560,Because I was not serious and I found it funny.
49561,after experiencing my current 144hz ips panel im never going back to TN again. my next upgrade would definitely be a 1440p 144hz ips
49562,What monitor would you be looking at now if you were to get one?
49563,"i honestly dont have a specific monitor in mind cos thats just not how i buy computer stuff. what i do is decide on a set of requirements or specs that i want and a strict maximum budget. then i stay patient while waiting for a good deal (new or used) to come by. i only ever buy parts when i get a good deal which is how i absolutely maximise my budget and it's worked well for me so far since i have the privilege of never needing anything urgently. for now, i'm waiting for any brand of used 27""/34"" ultrawide 1440p 144hz ips/va monitor under rm1100(roughly usd $267). i've seen quite a few listings for rm1200/rm1300 ($292/$316) so i'm sure ill get my chance soon. 

i actually bought my current 1080p 144hz monitor new because the second hand price for these high refresh rate 1080p monitors are actually pretty high so i just got a new one bcos the price difference was negligible. QHD 144hz monitors on the other hand depreciate quite a bit compared to new so i'll be aiming for a used monitor for my next upgrade."
49564,"As far as my research has taken me (my way of saying I ain't no expert) ... TN is done for. VA and IPS are the only viable now. Where cheap VA suck, cheap IPS are great for the money.

But expensive VA always beat expensive IPS.

And OLED would be best but it burns."
49565,"OLED doesn't burn if you set your Taskbar to auto-hide and don't just leave the display on it. Screen saver are back with OLED. 

If you use common sense, the. Burn in is ignorable. 

The thing that you do have to worry about is PWM, which most if not all OLEDs use. If the flicker is low enough Hz, some people are sensitive and it causes eye fatigue and migraines. 

I can't use any Apple laptops because the PWM they use causes a migraine within 10 minutes of looking at the display."
49566,I just bought the 34 ultrawide version of your monitor. It's my first gaming monitor too (I've been gaming since 1984) and I couldn't be more excited.
49567,Had a 144hz since 2018 and would never go to anything lower again. Only bad thing now is If my framerate drops below like 80 it feels really choppy to me lol.
49568,Be completely sure that sync is actually running. It makes a world of a difference and is more buggy than most people think.
49569,I have gsync enabled but it can't completely make up for the lower framerate so it still feels way less responsive than running at the full 144
49570,"I mean make sure it's 100% working. Sometimes it doesn't pick up borderless or windowed games. 

nVidia ctrl panel -> top bar -> display -> enable  g sync compatibility whatever

It shows a G Sync symbol top right (or left?) if it's actually really 100% running. 

For example, I had mine set for full screen games only (because I heard it simply doesn't work for borderless or windows).

But I couldn't stand full screen, it's horrible. I went to borderless and it only worked until the first alt tab, then it didn't anymore.

Changed settings to also detect borderless, and it worked for H:ZD. It probably won't work for older games though."
49571,"I'd like to point out a few things.

Getting a 144hz panel definitely makes sense even if you can barely do 60FPS in games, because the high refresh rate makes tearing less noticeable. I am now without a GPU so I'm trying out games on my iGPU, which rarely pushes above 60FPS in anything from the previous decade. And I have to note that I'm not noticing any tearing in these games. If you want to lock your framerate, with a 60hz panel you can only chose 20, 30 and 60FPS. With a 144 hz panel, you can lock at 24, 36, 48 and 72 FPS without changing the refresh rate of the panel.

It's worth saying that some 144hz monitors will have higher pixel response times when they're running at lower refresh rates. So if that applies to your model and you're running a game at something like 60FPS, you really want to run that game without adaptive sync unless it's causing issues.

When buying a monitor for gaming, always check the reviews (actual reviews that test the monitor, not just user reviews that talk about the experience and parameters). Overdrive in particular should be of interest to gamers. LCD pixels have to physically move in order to change their brightness (that's why they have response times). Overdrive does what the word implies, it pushes more current into the pixels, forcing them to move faster. The problem is that you can actually have too much overdrive - this is called overshooting and what happens is that the pixel moves further than it should and it then has to move back. The result is reverse ghosting, which (at least for me personally) is far worse than ghosting. That's why the highest overdrive setting isn't always the best (in fact, it almost never is).

Although expensive monitors can have the exact same panel as a cheaper one, the truth is that two panels of the same model don't necessarily have to be identical. This is especially true with very cheap monitors.  LCD panels aren't made individually, they're cut from a larger panel. Each panel is then inspected and rated for it's quality. Depending on the quality, the panel will either go into the more expensive or the cheaper model. So it's not that the manufacturer is purposefully limiting the cheaper monitor, they're using a panel that wouldn't pass the quality control of the expensive model. That's why professional monitors are so expensive - the panels that go inside them are cherry picked."
49572,"And then after you get a sick monitor, make sure the refresh rate settings are correct! This tip gets posted every 3 months (less?) and there is always someone who says ""holy shit i have a 144hz monitor but it was set on 60"". Don't be that person!!"
49573,"Just remember guys, you can save on used monitors more than most other computer parts. Once people don't want a monitor, it's a big and bulky item to put up with, so fast sales are usually desirable.

I bought my £1000 monitor for £300 5 years ago.

The average 1440p 144hz used price in UK is £220."
49574,"Meh, lg cx or c1 48 till they come out with something better. For me, oled>all. Bleed and light grey blacks are soooo bad. Just started looking for a new monitor last year and can't believe this sector isn't industry leading vs tvs. It's not even a competition."
49575,"oh my god oled panels are the best. It's a shame that  burn in is still somewhat of an issue, so they arent making any smaller (27 - 32"") monitors. And 48"" is way too big for me, and these two TVs ofc are way too expensive. I currently have the 27"" IPS LG GL850, which is (was?) considered a very good monitor, however the low contrast, terrible blacks/grays etc, and bleed are just fking the worst. Kinda wish I had bought a VA panel, maybe it'd be better.. 
I have a 65"" OLED tv as my main TV in the living room, and also an oled panel in my phone, and the pc monitor just doesn't compare to these..."
49576,"Exactly the same experience. I had to put a PC in the living room to play immersive games on the OLED Bc the gl850 black levels were so garbage. Now I just use it for competitive games and work, because other than contrast/black levels it’s a very good monitor."
49577,"oleds burn rather quickly if used on games. None of their solutions really work for static UI.

If you have the money to burn, go ahead tho. I'm sure they're the best you can get."
49578,"Better late then never eh ? :D  
I plan to buy a curved 27"" with wqhd when i can upgrade my RX 570"
49579,"yeah bro, got a curved 32in 165hz w/ AMD FreeSync, it was only $120 (found it used in like-new condition :D) difference between 165 and 60 is night and day."
49580,Would kill for a deal like that :O
49581,Used market is your friend.
49582,Its really rare to get a good deal like that here. Tried for a long time to get a good condition Nintendo New 2DS XL for cheap but never found one.
49583,A good gaming monitor in my country costs as much as a GPU. I'm fine with my peasant 75hz IPS monitor.
49584,"yeah, I got a 27” IPS 1080p 75hz monitor and it looks so clear (and actually feels too big). I live in the US, but that monitor was more expensive than what I paid for my GPU. I don’t feel like I’d be getting any worth out of seeing more frames or more resolution"
49585,"Don't get me wrong. I'm in the same situation. I've only actually had money for the last two years. 

My point was that if you already have a pc that, for the games that you personally play, could output way more FPS than you actually use - then it's worth thinking about an investment."
49586,"same. Finally got a 165hz monitor after years of using 60hz, difference is night and day"
49587,using phone 144hz feels very different from 60hz
49588,ya i upgraded from a 1080p 30hz (actually 29.95 or something like that) to a 1440p 144 hz dual monitor setup.  Def noticed a difference.
49589,"I've been gaming on proper monitors since I picked up the hobby again.  Not the best of the best but the best of the thrifty pieces.    


The jump from 60-144 was night and day,  Felt so much better.  Even scrolling as you mentioned,  It was a nice upgrade... Felt ""professional""  lol  I finally parked my 6700k and upgraded to something newer (3700x)  recently, and it pairs nice with my 2070.  So I said fuck it,  Upgraded the monitor to a 2560x1440/144hz  AOC. Not to expensive but better than wishdotcom products lol.      


Once again, I am grateful I made this choice, the upgrade was noticeable and I am enjoying old games a little more now that  I have it all dialed in.     


Good post btw.. +1 from me, good advice.. Hopefully someone who needs to see this does!"
49590,.... but still get merked by some dude with a bubble monitor.
49591,"I play solo games, so never."
49592,lol true
49593,get wrecked by AI who use no monitor
49594,"I have the older one, but 165hz. Its great tbh i wouldnt switch until i get enough money for 240hz"
49595,is it really necessary more than 144hz ? its just luxury
49596,Honestly I do notice a lil bit more smoothness in 165 but not that much. 144 is when your eyes finally get heavenised and you can’t switch back. If I could afford 240 I would get it because I play fast pace games
49597,"Well if you're very  competitive fps and fighting gamer then yeah it help. But for AAA games, it almost useless"
49598,Came to that conclusion too after my Dell ultrasharp U2412M has been with me since 2013. Got from gtx770 to gtx 1660ti and now Rtx 3070 it was about time. Since LG is coming with a new GP27850 the older LG 27GL850 is on sale. My old Dell uses an LG IPS display but it's lightyears behind my new monitor.
49599,">LG 27GL850

ah shit nano ips, i thought u will say amoled lol. But isnt your dell still good ? Decent Color, full HD, and low response time"
49600,"The response time is not for gamers if you look at real gtg on the dell, it's more suited for office and content."
49601,i using normal lg tv and im doing fine gaming. But yeah im searching full hd only monitor with very accurate color
49602,"Awesome post, for me the little guy I like what you explained in your post. I have a ryzen 5 1600af with a 1650 super. Play on 32 inch curved 1080 60hz and unless I start upgrading my tower I don't see a reason to switch to 2k or 4k. Or up my hz. Thankful for this post. (Apex legends, ff14, and raid shadow legends)
Good luck and have fun!"
49603,"News flash!

You perceive gaming as audio and visual. Monitor and headphones are of top priority.

That's what people don't get about phones too, power without quality is meh, that's why people like iphones.

In other news, invest on everything you spend time on, including bed/sheets/pillow, shoes, jacket."
49604,"Absolutely agree. I finally got an ergonomic chair because work from home. It has made a world of a difference.

I'm also looking at dac & amp options.

You are 100% correct."
49605,People like android too
49606,"This holds true for anything, computer related or otherwise. More importantly, achieving a balance between price-is-no-object and acceptable quality will give you a great experience without having to waste excessive amounts of money on products that really do not give you much benefit if any over less expensive, but high quality parts. You could be a millionaire, but there's still no reason to waste money. In fact, millionaires (barring lottery winners) generally got that way by being frugal even when buying high quality items.

My cousin wasted over $5000 on a WTFPWNBBQ etc. etc. PC years ago, while I spent under $2300 (both in Canadian currency) and got much better performance in every way, just by carefully selecting each and every component for quality gaming (and non-gaming, primarily Maya) performance at a reasonable price."
49607,"With the gpu scarcity and more and more people are gaming on onboard graphics, I think 60Hz panel isn't really that bad. I have a 144Hz panel and half of my games are physics-locked at 60fps. I would still prefer better color accuracy (especially deep blacks) over high refresh rates because I'm not a competitive fps/racing gamer. YMMV."
49608,"The 144hz is in reference to framerates, which are wholly unrelated to response times.  Response times are rarely an issue at all(even for competitive players) as any quality gaming monitor thesedays sport great response times. 


But 60hz panels are significantly worse, even if you end up gaming at 60fps.  A 144hz monitor will be far smoother even scrolling through websites, but even gaming at 60fps it will enormously minimize tearing.  

And a 144hz monitor is far more future proof.

Buying a 60hz display today is just dumb."
49609,I've been gaming for years and I recently got a gaming monitor which was 144hz. I had been using 60 hz on my old monitor. A week after I got the 144 hz monitor I changed the refresh rate to it. I didn't think it would change much but. Holy shit the difference is so noticeable. 60 hz really makes it hard to play competitively in fps games.
49610,No kidding! I was playing on a 1080p 60hz monitor with mediocre color and low brightness and now on a 1440p 144hz monitor I’m experiencing an entirely new feeling.
49611,"Lol I noticed my monitor was shit when I bought 1700€ gaming laptop when I started in a work that had me living in hotels 6-8 months a year.

That laptop's monitor was so much brighter and better colours that I didn't even want to play with my desktop when I came home."
49612,"*More things to consider:
All panel types have problems. My IPS pannel has HORRIBLE backlight bleeding. Only noticeable in full black screens so not so bad. But when it's there it's horrible.
Oled would be perfect. IF THEY DINDN'T BURN
Colors usually suck. These companies produce tiers of monitors, some extremly expensive, others doable. A lot of times the doable monitors have the same panel as the super expensive ones. So to compete, they fuck the color corection. Can be fixed, but without the tool - it will never be quite right. Still, muuuuuuch better than shitty office desktops.*

Heh, so true.

Currently on rather okay Acer Predator display. Useless for movies, ridiculous backlight bleed at bottom. Very good for everything else tho. Even colors are pretty okay once manually calibrated a bit. HDR seems like crap tho.

Also tried Phillips hybrid between TV/LCD. Super nice sound, useless semi-ambilight, very decent HDR. Unfortunately really poor color balance across screen and piss poor backlight near corners (basically looks like there is almost no backlight, so it has heavy vignetting near sides).

Very good as movie machine, very bad as everything else. :D

OLED last fine about 7k hours .. and then they dont.

Sadly mix of good refresh rate, good colors, good backlight are probably impossible (maybe some high endDELL?). EIZO unfortunately seems to not give any care about Foris lineup. :/"
49613,"Hah fck amoled, i will choose ips and crt any day. And quantum dot and nano ips is the future"
49614,"Yea, since then I moved to quantum dot too. Nano seems interesting, but its a heck load more of backlight, which will inevitably eat electricity and produce some more waste heat.

Thinking somewhat improved quantum dot could be winner. Mine has that double-diode qdot whatever and as far as backlight uniformity goes, its excellent. As long as one doesnt want HDR from it, then its noticeable when backlight peaks. Fairly good for less demanding HDR content.

It also heats a bit more and eats a lot more than regular QLEDs."
49615,"Ye I’m still using this 100 buck asus monitor I got for free from someone.  

I also have this TV screen-ish screen as a secondary and it displays the colors much better.  

I’m guessing the TV screen is IPS and I know the Asus PC monitor is TN."
49616,"I also recently went from a TV to only monitors. Even that is IMHO better, but not as much as going from a shitty monitor to a good gaming monitor.

So if your TV has good colors and contrast, it's still better than cheap monitors. IMHO.

But no where near as good as 144hz g / free sync."
49617,"The advice of g and free-sync is very good advice for someone needing to buy a new monitor. 

I do believe you need displayport for that feature. Not 100% sure"
49618,"I have been burned by HDMI so often that I refuse to even try. If you can get DP, then always go with DP. 

I use iVANKY DP and DP to HDMI cables. I'm quite okay with them.

DP to Hdmi because my work laptop doc only has DP out, and monitors have only one DP in.

And gaming KVM switches are not a thing yet."
49619,"I'm still waiting for a 32"" 1440p 144Hz FLATSCREEN IPS monitor that have a stand that takes minimum space (instead of something like the ROG tripod stand) and with G-Sync support

..I wonder if it will ever become a thing"
49620,"No man. Included stands are trash. Buy a desk monitor arm, or a wall mounted one. I'm still waiting for my Ergotron LX"
49621,"I thought of that before but since the screen will be like \~10cm away from the wall, desk/wall mount just feels awkward no matter how I slice it. And I'm not really in a spot that allows me to change my desk unless I change a few other furnitures as well"
49622,I recently started gaming on an LG Oled display and It makes a huge difference. The colors are just so vivid and it still runs at 120 which feels so nice. Probably my favorite part of my setup now
49623,"I just use my TV. Did figure out that I can run warhammer 2 in 1440p. I'll tell you, that made a HUGE difference."
49624,"I “upgraded” to the same monitor as OP and actually find the colours to be pretty meh, light bleed to be awful on dark backgrounds and I cannot really notice the difference between 60Hz and 144Hz.

I also can’t run it at its advertised 165Hz since it causes my GPU to idle at insanely high clocks.

G-Sync is fucking great though."
49625,"if you ever buy a non standard hz and hope it works, you scammed yourself. Sorry :("
49626,"Sorry, what is “non standard hz”?"
49627,"60 / 144 / 240

The rest are marketing gimmics. Turn the OMG 165 or 170 or 300 HZ, buuuut silently everything else gets turned down. More ghosting, lower response time, lower contrast, etc.

As far as I managed to research, this applies to every single monitor out there.

Mine is a 170 hz monitor, but I will never turn that option on"
49628,"The monitor performs fine at 165Hz. The problem lies with Nvidia’s Windows drivers, and is a known issue that is still not fully solved, especially for older cards (I’m on Pascal)."
49629,"Also make sure G-Sync is actually working, and that you've correctly set 144hz.

The difference between 60 and 144 is night and day. You can't miss it. It's impossible. More likely you have a bad cable, improper settings, or g-sync is not working.

See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/mx866u/seriously_get_a_good_gaming_monitor_i_cannot/gvmph5x/)."
49630,"I am 100% sure that it is configured correctly, however I cannot perceive any difference, either visually or via input latency.

The only way I can see the difference is to record moving my mouse rapidly between my two screens (other one is 60Hz) in slow-mo with my phone."
49631,"What's a decent 32"" gaming monitor that doesn't cost 5 Bitcoin though?"
49632,"Sadly I couldn't find any. So I went for 27""

Dell - S3220DGF ///// - but it's curved. Not my cup  of tea

SAMSUNG 32-inch Odyssey G7 //// but it's expensive

The 32"" variations of my monitor are inferior. I would not suggest them. 

So IDK"
49633,Ye they're nice. Ideally I want a 4k one. I've been using a 32 for so long now I think if I went to a 27 it would feel like a postage stamp.
49634,"i dont like curved too, its just placebo & marketing bullshit"
49635,"Don't forget about resolution and aspect ratio. I was an early bird going for ultrawides back in the day before they were mainstream. I understood the power of watching a movie in 2.35.1 or having the extra immersion when it came to gaming, or that extra space to have two documents side by side. It's well worth going for an ultrawide. Even back in the day when 1080p was new, I went for the 1920x1200 panels instead, the extra vertical space does make a difference when browsing, coding, etc.

Now I would consider nothing less than 3440x1440 if your budget allows it (possibly going for a VA panel as a tradeoff, or 60hz panel if you're not big into gaming). LG makes darn good panels and I can highly recommend them. They are one of two major (panel) manufacturers in the business and have typically great quality control.

The dream is of course 3880x1600  144Hz IPS, (cropped 4k)  the extra vertical space from a 1440 makes all the difference to me. LG has a few of those, but I'm not buying one yet though since I'm waiting for a proper HDR technology to hit the market (the current HDR specifications shouldn't even be considered HDR and are more of a marketing gimick ). Heck if I'm spedning 2k on a monitor it should have 'everything'. So I'm saving up for one hopefully next year. For now my 34"" 3440x1400 offbrand monitor will have to do : )"
49636,I dont think resolution more than 1080p good for gaming and watching. Because mostly people will game and watch from 1080p source. It will get blurry if your 2k/4k monitor watching 1080p source
49637,I said the same thing. Before I got 2k and 4k. I can't go back.
49638,But it's really blurry on 1080p right?
49639,"It's just small, not enough realestate, doesn't look good. I ain't eloquent enough to describe. 

2k Just feels better. 144 hz also feels amazing.

4k is even better, but 4k gaming just isn't there yet, imho. Not only GPU, but most monitors start loosing features when going to 4k, like 2k 144hz easy peasy lemon squazy. 4k 144hz - not so much."
49640,well from what i read 99% said 4k/2k monitor watching movie and gaming below their resolution it looks fugly
49641,"IDK man. I have never had the thought of ""X is better in 1080p"".

Nothing. Ever. Not a single once.

The only thing that comes to mind is if you run your monitor on non native resolution. So you have a 2k monitor, but for whatever reason it's at 1980x1080. That, makes sense. That is fugly as hell.

But that scenario is for what ... old ass games that can't run at higher rez. And nothing else."
49331,The LG27GL850 is the nicest gaming monitor I've ever had. I think you should be able to find the 27GN850 a little cheaper. The ability of the pixels to refresh so fast makes it amazingly clear and the ips panel is pretty damn good.
49332,Is the nano ips version worth it?
49333,"I'll put it like this, my previous gaming monitor was the AW2518HF, so pretty nice, 240hz and all that but a tn panel and before that it was an older 27""/1440/144 MSI with a va panel and the LG is much clearer and really good colors. Just my two cents."
49334,"I have the LG 27GL83A which is the same monitor with an sRGB color gamut I think (so no nano-IPS), significantly cheaper and I'm very satisfied with it. Unless you're doing very color-sensitive work with photo/video editing and the like, I would say there's no need to get nano ips."
49335,No it isn't worth the extra $70 imho.
49336,The 2721DGF is basically the same panel as the GL850 but with better qc.
49337,I have two of them that I recently bought and love them. I'll buy another in a few months when prices go down.
49338,"Ye it’s an awesome monitor, but be aware of glowing effect as it’s pretty common for ips to have such a problem. Also on downsides it’s definitely not a 1ms response time monitor and the hdr is terrible. So i’ve listed all the problems that u might face. I’m using this monitor for a year now and apart from these problems it’s pretty awesome"
49339,I have the GL83A and I can confirm it is the best monitor I have ever seen/used for gaming.
49340,"What about the  

[Acer Nitro VG280K](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1520406/acer-nitro-vg280k-zwart.html) ?"
49341,"I just purchased the Pixio PX277 Prime it is a 27” ips panel, 165hz refresh rate, and scored high for Hardware Unboxed, i will come back to this thread when I get it set up this week. It was $329.00 on amazon"
49342,What can you say
49343,I love it. Its a beautiful monitor right out of the box!
49344,"Can you give update 8 days after? I am looking at this monitor right now and wondering if it would make a good purchase. i am looking at 27 inch , 1440p monitor with 120/144+ refresh rate"
49345,Whats the difference between the GL and the GN?
49346,"From the research I did both the LG27GL850-B and Dell S2721DGF are very good, each edging other out in various categories. I ended up ordering the Dell, but if you find a good price on the LG then you are not making a mistake either. 

https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tools/compare/lg-27gl850-vs-dell-s2721dgf/912/16485"
49347,"From my research it was either one of those or the LG mentioned above.
I went for the LG.

So here are the finalized two websites I used to determine my pick, they're highly recommended, got to the same results I did by manually filtering them, with perfect tools for the job (wish I could've had their sort for picking my perfect case):

49348,The ASUS TUF VG27AQ is a really good 1440p 144/165Hz monitor. I recently just purchased it myself. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WQ4FXY9?tag=rtings-mn-p-20&ie=UTF8) is the Amazon listing for it and [here](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/tuf-vg27aq) is the [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) review for it.
49349,$530 seems like a lot compared to a lot of the other monitors around that level
49350,That isn’t the retail price.  That’s an amazon third party seller price
49351,I got my asus vg27aq for 429$ from micro center. That is the retail price.
49352,It's $429. https://pcpartpicker.com/product/pGqBD3/asus-tuf-gaming-vg27aq-270-2560x1440-165-hz-monitor-vg27aq
49353,i have 2 of these and they're wonderful.
49354,I have one and amazing!wow 2 thats awesome!
49355,Got the VG27WQ for a good price as well fwiw
49356,"I have this monitor and although everyone says it's pretty good, I find the contrast to be pretty awful but I don't see a solution for this other than using an OLED TV"
49357,Looks amazing ! Thanks for the recommendation !!
49358,"Maybe mine was a dud, but I found the pixel response time unbearable in certain situations. Specifically in dark to light transitions, it was really obnoxious. I now have the LG 27GL850 and I LOVE it."
49359,did you use black frame insertion or pixel overdrive on the asus one?
49360,"Yes, I tried a tooon of different settings. The dark transitions were especially bad with black frame insertion, and then without it, everything had pretty bad motion blur. I should note that I'm a very picky person and I notice quite subtle things that my friends/family think I'm crazy for obsessing over."
49361,I recently swapped my 27GL850 (due to dead pixel) for the exact same Dell S2721DGF. It's a brilliant monitor and might be the best 1440p 144/165Hz monitor under 500
49362,"Interesting, I did the opposite! Dell go LG"
49363,Both great monitors. Loved my LG when I had it.
49364,Isn't the 27GL850 a decent monitor?  What made you swap it out?
49365,It's a damn good monitor. I swapped it out because of a dead pixel that was in the center of the screen. Plus I was still within the return period. Only got the Dell because it had more features and was 70 bucks less
49366,Ahhhhh gotcha
49368,I was still within the return period for my local micro center. They accept anything within the first 30 days.
49369,Isn't the Dell not IPS tho? I like its ergonomic form tho
49370,The S2721DGF uses the same Nano IPS panel as the LG 27GL850. I believe the previous model the S2719DGF was a TN but this time around it's a Nano IPS and its fantastic!
49371,Ohy my these naming conventions
49372,Yeah lol they're weird but the names have a meaning. The 27 means 27 inch and the 21 means model year 2021. But I totally get you lol
49373,"Damn, everyone is looking at the same monitor, myself included. Lol."
49374,Dont hesitate friend. It's absolutely sublime. I seriously cannot think of anything wrong with it. Maybe no usb C ports but that's about it really.
49375,I can second this monitor. Absolutely fantastic.
49376,"Indeed. I love the small features like the blue led lighting, better cable management hole, frame rate counter, and swivel base."
49378,Had a dead pixel on the LG and it got annoying as it was in the center. Got a 2 year plan from micro center so that covered it
49379,When is it going to come back in stock?
49380,Best buy has them in stock and if you have a Micro Center near you you can check them as well. I picked mine up for $429 at micro center last weekend
49381,"Alright. I saw on buildapcsales about a month and a half ago you could get it for $375, should I wait until that deal comes back maybe? Or until like Black Friday? I’m not sure."
49382,"The Lenovo Legion Y27q-20 uses the same panel as the Dell. I picked one up for 364 dollars a week ago. Unfortunately, the sale is no longer active, but I'd recommend keeping an eye out. It's basically a perfect 16:9 monitor imo."
49383,Yeah I've seen them go that low as well. If you don't mind waiting until black Friday then theres a good chance itll drop to that again. Then again we dont know. Btw this monitor is also the same panel as the LG so a Nano IPS display.
49384,"I think someone else mentioned the LG 27GL83A-B. I got one and am extremely happy with it. I've been considering getting a second one.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YGZL8XF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_P9uJ2N5pZ2g8u"
49385,whats the difference between the b and the a-b
49386,"Acer XB271HU. 2560x1440 144 Hz IPS panel, OC to 165, comes with G-Sync."
49387,"I've had 2 of these for a couple years now, they're amazing

Thinking of going to 4K 144 Hz IPS next"
49388,"The speakers are some straight ass, but when you have 500 bucks for a monitor, you hope for more. I got a good set of standalone speakers for 30 bucks.

What hurts my soul is that my 1080 can't crush frames at 2560x1440. If I ever get my 3090 we'll see how it does. Seriously considering going to 1920x1080 IPS just for superior performance."
49389,Dude get a dell! It’s the standard for best all around monitor.
49390,The one you listed is probably the top of the line at 144/165hz 1440p. Would definitely just go with that.
49391,"I've got the 27gl850-B and can vouch for it.
Also why the series X if you've already got a PC? All exclusives are cross platform and Xbox controllers intrinsically work automatically on windows."
49392,Friends who play on it
49393,Online is cross platform except destiny no?
49395,"All games due for release on the Series X are playable online on PC, cross platform, except for Destiny 2, to my knowledge."
49396,"Ah that makes sense. I still have old games that I play on my Xbox, and I just sold my Xbox one x for $250 so I might as well buy the series x."
49397,"That's fair. Nice on the sale, I've been trying to sell my PS4 now for ages as I've got a confirmed order for a PS5."
49398,"Yeah and I got it for $120 with a controller. It was broken and still had the warranty, I was buying it to see if I could fix it myself and I just had to send it to Microsoft because it still had the warranty."
49399,Lmao hackerman
49400,Yeah it was pretty cool. Might end up selling the controller to GameStop or something I need to see how much they’ll give me
49401,I am going for LG27GL850. Dell uses LG panels so I would say that's a good choice also.
49402,"im using the lg27gl83a-b rn and I have nothing bad to say about it other than it is a little strenuous on the eyes at first but that is likely caused to be from swapping 1080-1440. Its like $380 usd and is gsync compatible. 144hz, 1ms, etc. I notice no IPS glow or any blacklight bleed in my panel but I could have gotten lucky"
49403,samsung cjg5
49404,If dell makes a monitor with the specifcations I want I usually go with them simply because their 1 stuck bright sub pixel deal. Most places require a cluster or a full pixel to be out.
49405,I’d go for the Dell
49406,"LG GL83A-B, basically a GL850-B without USB hub & wide color gamut but quite cheaper."
49407,Ah so that’s the difference between them. Thanks!
49408,"Yeah, wide color gamut thing doesn't even have any real advantage, infact it just makes colours look a bit more saturated which you may not like.

Also there is a newer model GN850 launched which may be available anytime soon. It is also cheaper with improved design.

49409,"Thinking about a 1440p as well, and after research I am torn between LG 27GL850 and Asus VG27AQ. Also I don't know if I should go for a high refresh rate with an rtx 2060."
49410,"You might as well, I have a 144hz 1080p monitor and it is very much worth it."
49411,[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQBPMJ2?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQBPMJ2?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) i just picked this one up this weekend. checks all  the boxes but for only $299. (plus a $10 display port cable but you may already have one lying around)
49412,If you can deal with the ugly looks this [HP monitor](https://www.microcenter.com/product/626500/hp-x27i-27-qhd-144hz-hdmi-dp-freesync-ips-led-gaming-monitor) from Microcenter is  a very good panel. Also if you can live with VA this [AOC monitor](https://www.microcenter.com/product/623930/aoc-cq27g2--27-wqhd-144hz-hdmi-dp-freesync-curved-led-gaming-monitor) is also a really good choice for $40 less.
49413,"I bought the lg 27gl83a-b recently and it’s performs great and looks good while doing it in my opinion, but I’m not exactly an enthusiast so the sRGB mode looks good enough to me."
49414,"Vg27aq, vx2758-2kp, vg272up"
49415,"I would really suggest the Dell S2721DGF, its been on sale around 380 for a few weeks now and its practically the best IPS 1440 high refresh rate monitor you can buy atm. 
the other competitor would be the Samsung G7 which a VA panel but still has amazing colors and better contrast, but has that crazy curve, which i personally dont like as i like watching a lot of shows and movies. but the G7 is also a good alternative and of course more expensive as well. 

i bought the Dell a week ago and its amazing, rly good colors and response times, the low contrast on reviews looks bad when they take photos but in real life, its really not a big deal if you are used to IPS panels. and the backlight bleed is also not bad as well."
49416,I have a asus vg27wq and absolutely love it for 1440p 165hrtz gaming
49417,"Some good 1440p 144hz monitors are the
LG 27GL850-B (IPS)
Viewsonic VX2758-2KP-MHD (IPS)
ASUS TUF VG27AQ (IPS)
AOC CQ27G2 (VA)

The Viewsonic and AOC monitors are the budget option, being cheaper than the LG and ASUS monitors.

Imo, it all depends on your budget, I'm probaly picking the AOC monitor myself because it's dirt cheap compared to the other option in my country."
49418,Gigabyte has a 27in ips 1ms built off lgs panel in the 850. Its 329 or 299 on sale I bought two of them and they come in tue
49419,"Since people have already answered your question, I wanted to ask, why are you getting an xbox series x if you're also getting a new gpu? I have nothing against it, I just want to know."
49420,I have the money too and I have friends who play on one but not the other. Idk I may not be getting the gpu but I’ll see.
49421,I have the dell monitor you mentioned and it’s been pretty good to me
49422,The dell you said or LG people are recommending are the best for sure
49424,"I just got this one this weekend and set it up yesterday, it's great. no complaints! definitely a huge steal for only $299"
49425,Hmm I may actually get that one. I have a $40 Amazon gift card and that one is on sale quite a bit. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do.
49426,"AOC has one, really cheap for what u get"
49427,"LG 27GL850, or Asus VG279AQL1A"
49428,"TLDR: They are amazing monitors and perform wonderfully.  But I suggest you read my post in its entirety. :)

I have two of the dell versions you're looking at and I can tell you they are butter and Dell support if you have any issues is magnificent.  I say that because I had an issue with a 34-inch widescreen having a little too much IPS glow and they replaced it no problem at all. You can't go wrong if you end up making this purchase.  Overclock to 165 at an affordable price on an IPS screen... the only thing I would suggest is to catch a sale.  They always have sales."
49429,What gpu are you upgrading to? I'm looking into to upgrade my gpu and monitor to run at 1440p 144hz. I currently have a rtx 2060 and benq  60hz monitor. Im looking into a 2070 super. Would that be sufficient?
49430,Curious why you're getting a Xbox if you already have a gaming PC
49431,"I like playing on both idk. Computer for some games and Xbox for others

Also friends who only have one or the other"
49432,"Interesting. I'm in a similar boat as you, but getting PS5 cause of the exclusives and anyone I know is also rolling PC, PS5 or both. I guess its just Xbox presence outside of America"
49433,"I’m American though lol. I’ve just always had Xbox and so have my friends, so it just makes sense. I should honestly just not get the Xbox but I haven’t made up my mind."
49434,"Gigabyte G27Q. It's got a flat and curved version. Flat is IPS 27in, 1440p, 144hz, 1ms, G-sync compatible, and HDR certified. It's also got height and tilt adjust and 2 usb 3.0 on the monitor"
49435,Oh wow that actually looks like a good option. Thanks man!
49436,I just bought it for myself last week. It comes in around $320 if I remember right
49437,"That looks correct. I may wait until Black Friday for a deal on a monitor. Not too sure yet, and I doubt I’m gonna be able to get a series x anytime soon lol."
49438,"I'm with a Samsung CHG70 (C27HG70) which is 1440p, 144Hz, VA panel, 10-bit color depth, HDR, FreeSync 2, curved, 1ms, 27 inch. All that you can expect for a purrfect gaming monitor 😂
It also does have ambient light on the back and USB hub that I use for my keyboard and mouse dongles.
I'm happy with that one but don't know if it's sold nowadays, it's near 2 years old now.

There's also the 31.5"" model named C32HG70 that shares same specs and another called CHG90 which is a big overkill ultra-wide (32:9) that shares same specs but being  3840 X 1080.

Also I suppose they released other series with same specs on this two years that should share similar specs with a new series and model name. They price started at 860€ on release date and last time I saw one it was 499€

Didn't tried LG gaming monitors, I've a 27UL500-W which is 4K 60hz IPS sRGB 99% which I use for design tasks.

On my GF rig (which all parts that she uses were mine) we've an AOC which works well but definitely the quality of materials is far to the quality of a Samsung or an LG even being one of the expensive models back those days (fullHD 144Hz 1ms Freesync, USB hub, shitty TN panel, adjustable base...) But it does the trick as she mainly play e-sports games to stream on twitch"
49439,no flatness buy the odyssey g9
49440,"I have the dell and love it. For the price to performance, I felt it was worth it."
49441,Don’t quote me on this but I’ve been eyeing this one for some time now: [link](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/DNH8TW/gigabyte-g27qc-270-2560x1440-165-hz-monitor-g27qc)

49446,"S2719dgf has been super solid for me for over a year no problem. It’s $400 on Amazon and Best Buy but Amazon day is on the 13th and the price may go down and you can have Best Buy price match it so it’s easier returns/warranty and no shipping time.

49448,Get [hdr monitor](https://denwereview.com/best-hdr-gaming-monitor-xbox-one-x-ps4-pro-pc/)
49449,"I bought [this one](https://www.synthesizerguide.com/viotek/) off of amazon and I personally love it - haven't had any complaints. The monitor build looks nice. It has a plastic body and is sturdy enough. The curve is simple and not overdone. The buttons for settings are underneath on the bottom right side and are pretty easy to work with. It has a blue power led that points straight down and reflects on the table surface.

&#x200B;

I'm using it with the Sapphire Nitro+ RX 580 8GB."
49450,"I have a Dell S2716DG which has been fantastic. It’s a TN panel, but has great colors. The early revisions had problems with color banding, but they fixed that later. 
It’s got G-Sync and runs about $599, but you can often find it on sale for like $450. 

I’d recommend it happily."
49451,"2nd this, ive had mine 3 years now and calibrated it through nvidia control panel. My colors always look great in game. I know some of the monitors had some issues but mine is perfectly fine. ymmv but based on my experience its a great monitor when you can snag it at 450ish"
49452,"They all have issues with colour banding, and it's an extremely mediocre TN monitor."
49453,"i have no idea why you are being downvoted you are completely correct, this monitor is notorious for having awful banding"
49454,"guy: ''observation''.

(has downvotes)

guy2: I agree.

(has upvotes)

&#x200B;

Edit: I figured it out 

`extremely mediocre`

/s"
49455,"Completely disagree. I have virtually no color banding on mine. The last two revisions don’t have an issue with it, and it’s definitely above average.

Edit: I’ll note that color banding is not entirely eliminated in the A08 and A09 revisions, it’s barely ever noticeable and I’ve certainly not noticed it myself.

I’m not saying it’s the best monitor out there, but for value for money on 1440p/144Hz it’s hard to beat."
49456,"All revisions absolutely suffer from banding. Unless you followed a random online garbage ""calibration"" guide, which is irrelevant (due to how inconsistent the monitor is) and inherently causes other issues.

Look [here to test banding](http://bestmonitorsbyncx.createaforum.com/general-discussion/best-144hz-monitors/?message=333).

The monitor is extremely average, with rtings.com's copy having a laughably bad [<650:1 contrast ratio](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1381), awful [black uniformity](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1420), lower [than average gamma](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1467) along with usual TN issues (terrible viewing angles, vertical gamma shift, etc.).

Also, with the release of the S2719DGF (and nVidia's support for FreeSync) the S2716DG is completely irrelevant (excluding a lack of strobing/ULMB on the S2719DGF)."
49457,"That’s fair. I’ll agree with the blacks not being the best, but I didn’t know about nVidia supporting FreeSync.

I’m still happy with mine for now, my main focus is upgrading CPU and Mobo atm, but maybe I do monitor afterwards.

I think the monitor is better than you’re making it out to be, but I accept that my information is likely dated."

Heres a review of it: https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/chg70 I generally recommend this website if you want to compare monitors.

They should be working on a faster 165 hz version which might mean you can catch it on sale if youre lucky."

49464,"It's used at 262€ from Amazon warehouse, so I can benefit from amazon return policy in 30 days...

Are the colours very washed out? I know it's a TN. How is black uniformity and contrast?

How does it perform in game?

Thanks"
49465,"I bought it new off amazon, it's used cause acer hasn't resupplied them yet. I literally bought the last one. You can check my recent posts. I posted the same thing last week looking for a monitor. It's a matte screen which I enjoy. 

In game it looks great. I've played red rising 2. Metro series. Apex. Some CS. And halo CE and 2."
49466,I'm in italy though
49467,"I'm sure if you copy and paste the make and model into google there will be some at computer parts stores (idk if you have them in Italy, I know some EU countries do, we don't in the US ofc) near by or online. The amazon link was just to show. 

You can also choose from a list of [these monitors](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13797/nvidia-g-sync-compatible-monitors.jpg)  that are gsync freesync compatible. It's where I chose my monitor from! You may find something better than mine on there that you like."
49468,"I only found it on amazon used, I'll give it a try though"
49469,"If you can't. Just get it used. That's a hell of a deal. I paid close to $400USD for it. I love mine! 

You can always refund it if you don't like it! It'll save you some cash to put towards something else too."
49470,"Nevermind, it doesn't have a vesa mount and I need it. Fffffff"
49471,"Theres actually not that much choice. You can use a [monitor picker](https://www.productchart.com/monitors/) for that.  
It all  basically boils down to is what kind of panel you want - TN or IPS. You can google if you don't know - there are tons of information about this.  
With G-sync and those parameters that you want there is literally only 3 different TN monitors and 2 IPS (3 on the website but 2 of them are practically the same thing)."
49472,"Tried to look on Subito . It? 
I managed to take home a PG278Q for 300€ and another one for my roommate.
They are used but the price is awesome if you can find an offer"
49473,Yeah I'm looking but I can't really find anything interesting
49474,"I bought a XF270HUA for $400. 1440p, 144hz, IPS, Freesync, 27"", adjustable stand."
49475,"I just bought that same monitor yesterday from Microcenter! I wish the whites were whiter (less yellow). I also miss having a joystick control for the OSD and accompanying software like my LG panel had. Other than that, I'm a happy customer."
49476,"You should calibrate it, the color accuracy and uniformity on it is pretty good actually. And yeah I also miss the little joystick on the LG."
49477,"Yeah, I did that through Windows. It's definitely the panel. Cool is the only setting where it's as good as it gets when it comes to white but it's no biggie. I might just be too picky and too used to the richness of my LG. It's only day 2."
49478,"Cool and Warm are usually garbage, setting it to custom and tweaking the settings usually gives you the best results, but you'll need a color calibrator to get the best results. I suggest buying one, using it, and then returning it lol"
49479,How is the response time considering is a Ips panel? Does it have a Vesa mount support? Thanks
49480,Time response is a meme.
49482,It wont ever make any sort of noticeable difference.
49483,"So you would tell me to go for it and buy it as my gaming monitor?

49490,"It's 470€ in Italy, I might get it"
49491,"I have a Viotek GN27D 1440p@144hz freesync monitor. It is a VA panel and curved. The colors are really good, but the response time isn’t the best. But as you said this is your second monitor not sure if the response time should be that high on the request list. I honestly haven’t had anything faster then 5ms response time and have had zero issues with it. But, that is me and what I see is most definitely going to be different than what you see."
