28026,Eggs Benedict
27859,"I like my eggs runny, so much so that I can mop it up with the toast. My girlfriend thinks its disgusting, and I don't know why. Its fairly normal."
27860,Runny yolks good. Runny whites bad.
27861,Yea. Runny white equal food poisoning
27862,"A wonderful dish, but people get pissy when you run the blender in the morning."
27863,Maybe those people should eat some Eggs Benny. That'd cheer me up.
27864,A blender is the wrong way to do it use a whisk and a double boiler for the hollandaise and you can even use that same water to boil the eggs
27865,"Breakfast tacos!

I just make a container of scrambled eggs and some sausage or bacon at the beginning of the week, heat it up with a bit of cheese added, and then put it in a taco shell or tortilla wrap. Sometimes I'll add jalapeños and/or salsa for a bit of a kick.

I'm telling you, it's heaven in a shell."
27866,I miss this about living in San Antonio.  Best mom and pop joint breakfast tacos evar.

27872,"This past christmas, my aunt who recently conquered esophageal cancer, came to spend time with my family.
For almost 9 months, my aunt never had barely any solid food, but relied on infusions of boost and other meal supplements to get her nourishment. 
She would watch TV every day and would see ads for McMuffins from McDonalds and wished for the day she could have one.

On Christmas eve night, my mum ran out to McDonalds and asked for 10 wrapping papers that McMuffins came in. The next morning, the look of my aunts face was priceless when she saw these homemade McMuffins wrapped up in the McMuffin papers, and I'll never forget how happy she was that she got her wish for one of her first solid meals in months

Since then, homemade McMuffins will always be at the top of my list"
27873,"Lox Bagel. Salmon, pickled capers, cream cheese, and red onion on top of a poppy seed-encrusted bagel. Just perfect."
27874,"Ah, the McJew"

Just split some biscuits in half, shake them in a bag with sugar and cinnamon, clump them together in a dish like pan. Take excess sugar and cinnamon and mix it with a lot of melted butter and pour it on top of the biscuits. Then bake like normal biscuits."
27881,"I have oatmeal every morning.

I don't know if I enjoy it or if it's just become a habit from trying to eat healthy."
27882,Ugh. The only way my parents ever got me to eat oatmeal was by buying the one with the dinosaur eggs. And even then I just ignored the oatmeal in favor of the tiny dino babies.
27883,The secret to any good oatmeal is putting a crapton of brown sugar in it.
27884,My method of execution as well. Its basically a bowl of brown sugar with some oatmeal in there.
27885,Apple cinnamon oatmeal is the bomb.  Dice up half a fuji apple & stir.
27886,"Same here, but I fill it up with stuff. Berries, eggs, almond butter, cinnamon, cottage cheese, honey, bananas... Its actually getting a little out of hand now that I think about it."
27887,"Every time I think of oatmeal I'm like ""mmm, that actually sounds good. I haven't had that in forever"", and then I make some and it tastes like shit. I need to dump all kinds of shit into it to make sure it doesn't taste like soggy cardboard."
27888,Pussy.
27889,Better than a strawberry and Nutella crepe with hash browns.

27896,"Julioberto's, Amados, Armondos, Los Betos, and Super Burrito."
27897,"As an LA transplant, I survived my first few months in Phoenix with filobertos."

27900,Cold pizza.
27901,"Poached eggs on a bed of extra crisp hash browns and corned beef, topped with hollandaise. Ethiopian Harar coffee."
27902,"For me my perfect breakfast goes a little something like this... 

I start off with 2 slices of fresh pagnotta bread, then I trot over to the BBQ cue and fire that lovely machine up! Now that the barby has reached a fiery heat I gently place the slices of bred onto the grill. After the first minute I flip each slice in order to get a nice crosshatch grill mark. A few more seconds go by and it is time to start the party. 

I gather some extra virgin olive oil, place my finger tip onto its tap leaving only a slight opening and then I begin to slowly drizzle drazzle this golden liquid onto the canvas that is the bread. As the party starts to get rockin I then add a slibba slabba of fresh ricotta (my nonna knows a guy, none of that store bought crap) and spread each slice with a block of cheese, going from Iqaluit to Havana then back up to the great North. Now that the guests have settled in, I take a teaspoon and scoop up some sugar and like a snowfall on a sunny winter day in Montreal, I sprinkle sprankle it on top of the ricotta. 

As I am doing this, the whistle of my 2 cup cafetiere begins to sing. The espresso is finally coming to completion and it is then that I take that cafetiere and gently let the bitter yet delicious nectar cascade into my espresso cup. 

Then in a matter of seconds, I scarf the who fucking thing down and return to life as it was."
27903,Freakin breakfast sausage covered in pancake syrup!
27904,I knew I wasn't alone in my love of sausage and syrup. Everyone looks at me like I'm insane when I do this.
27905,"eggs with sriracha.

that stuff was MADE for that stuff"
27906,"Put 2 Shredded wheats in a bowl. Fill it with boiling water. After 15 seconds or so, strain off the boiling water.

Add butte and sugar to taste, mix thoroughly with the hot, soggy shredded wheat and enjoy.

My mum learned to make this because my dad's mum made it for him. His family was from Liverpool. I've no idea whether that was a local dish or just a family tradition."
27907,Sounds really good I might try it
27908,Fry bacon. Fry hashbrowns in bacon grease. Fry over easy egg. Pile it all together and you have the best breakfast ever. (Sour cream on the side.)
27909,Vegemite toast.
27910,Chocolate Chip Belgium Waffles.
27911,"How has nobody yet said country fried steak??? With eggs, hash browns, and lots of gravy. I'm drooling."

Then bacon of course...crumbled up into the pancakes instead of blueberries if you want [bacon pancakes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=1eO5U_uN7DQ#t=9s)"
27913,I REALLY like to have a strawberry smoothie with little waffle bits in it. You eat it with a spoon
27914,How would you make that? Just stick a waffle in the blender with the smoothie?

27973,"Scrapple, scrambled eggs & fried potatoes."
27974,"""Breakfast is the only meal of the day that I tend to view with the same kind of traditionalized reverence that most people associate with Lunch and Dinner. I like to eat breakfast alone, and almost never before noon; anybody with a terminally jangled lifestyle needs at least one psychic anchor every twenty-four hours, and mine is breakfast. In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home — and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed — breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert... Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music… All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.""

27988,"Yes! Cold from the fridge or just stale, from sitting on the counter in the box from last night?"
72359,Both
27990,Microwaving it is the best way. So when it's finished the cheese gets all chewy and greasy. I was also a cold pizza guy before I watched that episode of The Sopranos where the priest came to Carmela's house. Now I'm completely for microwaving it.
27991,"No no no. You microwave it, but while it's microwaving you heat up a skillet with a bit a butter in it. Then you toss the slice in the skillet and crisp up the crust. If you're into it, flip the slice over after the crust is crisp and fry up the cheese a bit. Fantastic."
27992,"What? Microwaving it is like the worst way to reheat pizza, it makes it all rubbery. Using an oven, toaster oven, or iron cast skillet are all way better at reheating pizza."
27993,Or leftover Asian and Mexican food
27994,With peanut butter
27995,I am disgusted but intrigued

27999,Best way to reheat pizza is in a skillet and put the glass top on. Makes it supwr crispy and the cheese melts nice
28000,"I'm disgusted that none of you have mentioned

FRENCH TOAST"

28004,you're gonna eat this god damn french toast and it's gonna be the best fucking thing you've ever put in your heathen mouth
28005,Pancakes. I've never been a huge breakfast person but pancakes can be an any time of day food depending what you put in or on them.
28006,Pancakes are inferior waffles. Change my mind.
28007,"Waffles are crispy, pancakes are fluffy. Pancakes for the win."
28008,"I'm reposting this from myself a bit farther down but yeah this.  
A good waffle should be crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and the best part is it holds more syrup than a pancake can. Also you should be using real maple syrup none of that Aunt Jemima fake crap."
28009,"As a Vermonter, I only ever use real syrup. That said, the amount that fits in a waffle is overkill. There IS such a thing as too much of something good."
28010,"You, sir, are overcooking your waffles"
28011,"Waffles with a little grits mixed into the batter is excellent. That texture.

28016,Waffles are pancakes with a syrup trap.
28017,French toast. I could eat a loaf of it without issue.
28018,I love me some hash browns.
28019,"Not shredded though, right?"
28020,Huevos rancheros. Or a hashbowl.
28021,What is a hashbowl?
28022,"Something the weed smokers do

28048,"Bacon sandwich made with 3-4 rashers of fat-trimmed English bacon (not streaky bacon), warm freshly-baked bread, a light spread of proper butter on one side and a slightly more generous spread of ketchup on the other.

The best combo of fried spuds, grilled onions, scrambled eggs, chopped ham, chopped bacon and chopped tomatoes in a soft flour tortilla you could imagine. Served with sour cream. Delicious but not health food for sure. Other breakfast burritos just don't compare, in our opinion. The locals are going to be pissed I told Reddit about it. Try one and be smitten."

28164,I picked up a bottle several months back after someone mentioned it on Reddit.  Damn it's good and a little splash is all you need.  That stuff can take bland rice and really make it sing.  Gotta love MSG when used right.
