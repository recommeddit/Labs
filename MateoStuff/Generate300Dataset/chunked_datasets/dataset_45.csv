14481,"I have read book 2, and also The Bird and the Sword. I read Where The Lost Wander a few days ago too. I like HF but haven't read much in that setting and I thought it was really good."
14482,"I was going to reply to this thread with ""What the Wind Knows"" by Amy Harmon! Amy Harmon deserves more love!"
14483,"I LOVE Amy Harmon and since you do too, I'm going to give this Radiance book a shot!"
14484,It's slow burn romance with great characters. Grace Draven has way of writing romance. Hope you will like it.
14485,I keep seeing this being suggested and it sounds interesting. Moving it up my TBR.
14486,I just added this yesterday to by TBR pile after everyone was talking about how great it is. Thank you!
14487,I bet you can’t guess.
14488,I just read Beach Read last week because of you and was absolutely NOT disappointed. Thanks :)
14489,Yay!  We got another one!
14490,Samsies! See this is so worth seeing in every thread because I didn’t read it until now and I should have read it so long ago!
14491,I just got the book from it being recommended all the time but haven't started it yet.
14492,You’re in for a treat.  Enjoy!
14493,Thanks! I can't wait to get off from work so I can start it!
14494,Another one to add to the list.
14495,I should bill the publisher.
14496,You should definitely be getting some royalties lol
14497,"I've been hearing so much buzz about this book, and my library hold is five months long 😫 Might give in and buy it!"
14498,"Well hurry up and get on the hold list!  Also, someone might be able to loan it to you.  There’s a website about it but I can’t remember what it is.  /u/midlifecrackers do you remember what that website is?"
14499,"Some people can do a loan through Kindle, if they already own it. I'm not exactly sure how it works?"
14500,/u/ladyofthepack might know because I think she did some loaning to someone.
14501,[Here](https://bookriot.com/how-to-lend-a-kindle-book/) is a how to guide on the Kindle loans.
14502,"I'm on the hold list, I'm just impatient :)  If it's through kindle loans, not all books can be loaned, it depends on the publisher.  Most aren't, but I don't mind buying books if I'll read them more than once."
14503,"Disclaimer: I'm a sucker for the Beauty and Beast trope and tortured alpha heroes so most of the books I recommend below reflect that.

14504,">Lover Awakened (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #3) by J.R. Ward

Oh my heart, I cried so much. One of the first books I read which talked about >!male rape and horrific abuse!<. My fav BDB book hands down."
14505,If you loved Lover Awakened you’ll enjoy Demon from the Dark. Zsadist and Malkom have very similar back stories. Demon From the Dark is #9 in the Immortals After Dark series but I read it as a stand-alone and had no problem.
14506,"Mariana Zapata, I always recommend her to my friends who aren't big readers but are looking for something to get them hooked!"
14507,"I finished The Wall of Winnipeg and Me yesterday in one day (like 3 interrupted reading sessions) and it was SO FREAKING GOOD. I am grateful to everyone who recommended it over and over on this sub. I'm probably reading Kulti next, or Red White and Royal Blue."
14508,"I love the Wall of Winnipeg and Me!! Kulti is great as well, and I loved Lukov with Love! Hope you enjoy them"
14509,"Red, White and Royal Blue is fantastic! I’m excited to put Kulti on my list now too. Seems like a lot of love for it. 💜"
14510,Control F: Kulti
14511,Ok I have seen her name mentioned a ton. Which book would you pick for someone new to her. Best work?
14512,"The Wall of Winnepeg and Me or Kulti, those are my two favorites"
14513,Awesome! Thanks so much!
14514,Chiming in to say Kulti is one of my favorite romance books and I recommend it here more frequently than I should.
14515,"OMG Nalini Singh. All day every day. (sidenote: I so wanted to comment this on that amazing thread but I was late by like 11 hrs, so thank you for giving me a chance to do it here, haha)

But really Nalini Singh, must read. Contemporary, paranormal, urban fantasy, suspense thriller with a light romantic thread, you name it, Singh has written a book in it. Give me a request and I can dig up a Singh rec for you.

Any day now, I expect her to drop a historical romance and just complete my life, lol.. 

Also, Shelly Laurenston,  I wanna be her heroines when I grow up. Batshit insane, and truly terribly hilarious, and unapologetically violent. And her heroes are equally ridiculous.  I 😍 her so much!!!!"
14516,Roni Lorens By the Hour and Uprooted by Naomi Novik. I am a two trick pony.
14517,Uprooted is a beautiful book.
14518,"Uprooted was the first book I read on recommendation from this sub and now all recommendations seem to falter in comparison for how impactful this book was. 

I've like lots of books since which have been recommended, but none which stayed with like Uprooted.  I like you two-trick pony."
14519,"I love Ilona Andrews' books and have re-read all their series multiple times. I read almost all romance sub-genres and non-romantic fiction/sci-fi/fantasy too but I especially love world-building storytelling and the way Ilona Andrews has done that in each of their series (and also included romantic relationships) is \*chef's kiss\* good. I would recommend their books to any reader but I think those who read mostly contemporary or historical romances aren't interested in a urban fantasy series. They are missing out!

I have been going through a book slump for the last few weeks and with their newest release in their Hidden Legacy series, ""Emerald Blaze"", I started re-reading the 1st in that series to catch myself up. Book slump officially gone."
14520,Love Lettering by Kate Clayborn. I loved this book so damn much that I'm actually hesitant to recommend it sometimes lest someone dislike it! I can normally deal with someone not liking a fave but I loved it too much for that lol.
14521,"Came here to recommend that one too!  It was on sale last week so I bought it for my book club, now I'm all nervous that they won't love it :)

Have you read her Chance of a Lifetime series?  I adore all three, such a fun premise and portrait of friendship."
14522,"I haven't read the series yet, I have two of them though & plan to get to them soon (my TBR is huge).
I hope your book club loves it! I recommended it to mine too when it was on sale last month and my BFF read it and liked it but nobody else has given feedback yet."
14523,"One of my favourite books too! So fresh, so sweet and so amazing I read it in one sitting!"
14524,"hmmm...well looking at my current top 25 books I'm going to skip over my beloved St Alexis since you are already a convert...and any other favs that get plenty of sub love (looking at YOu [The Spymasters Lady](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959745.The_Spymaster_s_Lady) and [all of Sherry Thomas](https://www.goodreads.com/series/145752-the-london-trilogy)' HRs and  [Lord of Scoundrels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425377.Lord_of_Scoundrels?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=jSVmVthrwP&rank=1)) soo that brings me to ***the great books on my best of list that no one else recs much***\*:\*

ETA: sorry its like trying to pick a favorite child so i only threw one title per favorite neglected but worthy author xoxo"
14525,I will check these out. Jo Beverley is one of my old school favorites. I loved her stories so much. I was sad when she passed away. 💜
14526,I'm reading my first JoBev Medieval right now and I love it so much...and am in the middle of a 2 week long medieval deep dive that started with Laura Kinsale as part of my AJH rehab...so i suspect my top 25 will be in for another shake-up soon. \*sigh\* 😘💗
14527,"Yes, Jo Beverly’s medieval romances were wonderful too. 😍 I have read far too many of her books. I always care about her characters and she usually has a well crafted story that supports the romance. I rarely got bored reading her! I’m in an AJH detox too since I have finished all but one of his books 😬 hence asking for recommendations!"
14528,have you checked out all the authors he recmd during his AMA...Sandra Schwab...and Rose Lerner and EE Ottoman..i think  there were others...and he has shelves on good reads with romancelandia picks...💕💕😍😍
14529,Yes I have read several authors he mentioned. Anyone that has stood out to you? How do you check out his shelves on Goodreads? Obviously I need to figure out how to navigate that site better!
14530,"I haven't made it to reading any yet honestly they are buried in the TBR...but Sandra Schwab sends several free shorts if you sign up for her newsletter which was nice...

here is a link for one of his favorites shelves:

[https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/19022440?shelf=a-few-of-my-favourite-things](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/19022440?shelf=a-few-of-my-favourite-things)"
14531,"Awesome! Thank you! Yes, my TBR is growing..."
14532,absolutely!! xo 👍🥰
14533,"I am always surprised when I DON’T see Tessa Bailey recommended on every “Favorites” post because I love her books sooooooo much! My top of the list TB books are: Fix Her Up; Getaway Girl; Runaway Girl; Mouth to Mouth; Indecent Exposure; and Crashed Out. 
I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!"
14534,Thank you so much for the suggestion! I will check her out.
14535,She's the Queen of dirty talk
14536,CONSENT-based dirty talk!! It’s like: consent consent all over the place!!! (At least in all the ones I’ve read) I love it!!!!
14537,Yusss.
14538,Sounds good to me! I’m a big fan of consent and dirty talk. Who hoo!
14539,Same! I never get how shes not mentioned more! She's my absolute fave 💕
14540,My girl TB brings the sweet and the heat! 💘
14542,"I can’t wait for Tools of Engagement to be released this month!! Somehow I haven’t read Captivated yet, but I just purchased it. Thanks!"
14543,"[The Spymaster's Lady by Joanna Bourne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959745.The_Spymaster_s_Lady) is my favourite book. It is so good that it is far beyond, ""too good to put down"" and has achieved the rarefied level of, ""can hardly bear to pick up again"" because you are savoring what has already happened, but are also afraid that this sublime quality cannot be maintained. Spoiler— the quality is maintained.

It is a adventure romance of enemies in Napoleonic France and England where the attraction is founded upon respect for each other's skill and character, with physical sex appeal secondary.

The heroine, Annique Villiers, is one of the four characters in my, ""Pantheon of heroines"".

Don't look at the cover. It is undoubtedly sabotage, the work of a jealous rival who knows they will never equal this work ;-)

BTW, this is not the sort of topic where every, or even most comments require a reply for politeness. An upvote like I do on WDYR is sufficient thanks."
14544,"Not a book, but an author. I’m pretty sure I recommend Talia Hibbert way too often. She’s just really, really good."
14545,Nice! Do you have a favorite book of hers?
14546,"Get A Life, Chloe Brown is a great place to start with her, but my favorite may be The Princess Trap. But honestly, she only has one or two books that I don’t love, the rest are all amazing."
14547,Ok great! Someone else mentioned Chloe Brown so I’m putting that on my list. I will check out the princess trap as well.
14548,Same! Always a go-to rec for me. Mating the Huntress is perfect for the upcoming Fall...
14549,Totally agree with you. Her writing is so good.
14551,This series is SO GOOD. I loved all the books and read them so quickly. 10/10
14552,"Wellllll, I recommend Kristen Ashley A LOT. It’s annoying. I annoy myself. In my defense, she’s written a ton of books and I’ve read almost all of them in the last year, so they’re fresh in my mind. There’s almost always at least one of her books that fits a requested trope. MC? Check. Alpha? Check. Second-chance? Check. Law enforcement? Check. Athlete? Check. Musician? Check. Shy heroine? Check. Sassy heroine? Check. 

Lately, I have been holding back recommending her as much. Even if it doesn’t seem like it! Bwa.

ETA: I have never read Alexis Hall or Klune. What titles would you recommend? Clearly I need to expand my horizons."
14553,"Oh, An Alexis Hall newbie! He is amazing. He writes beautiful, LGBTQ contemporary novels that are take your breath away funny, genuine and heartfelt. I usually recommend Boyfriend Material as a starting point (fade to black but the romance is on point). However my favorite of his novels is For Real. I just can’t say enough good things about it. Um, but just know that one is not fade to black. Far from it 😉

TJ Klune is very similar in that he writes LGBTQ romance stories. His sweetest book is The House in the Cerulean Sea. No sex and the romance is a sub plot but beautifully written. 

My favorites of his are Wolfsong and the rest of that series. It is paranormal romance with werewolves but it is really well done and one of my favorites of that genre. 

The Lightning Struck Heart is hilarious. It basically makes fun of fantasy tropes and the main character is so endearing. Laugh out loud funny but with a sweet, slow burn romance. Lots of pining. 

For contemporary- I really enjoy his How to Be a Normal Person."
14554,"I'm reading Boyfriend Material right now, my first book of his, and I am absolutely taken by how sharp, funny, and clever it is. I've laughed out loud several times and I'm only 25% in. I can't wait to read his others!"
14555,Sigh. He is seriously the best. Enjoy! No one makes me fangirl like Alexis Hall. He is also so kind to his fans. 😍😍😍
14556,I put TJ Klune’s The Lightening Heart on my list. Can’t wait to read it!
14557,"I adore The House on the Cerulean Sea! It's one of my favorite novels that I've read this year.
I got the impression that TJ Klune's other novels were more YA though. Is this accurate?"
14558,"Haha, she's my crack addiction author. Every single KA fan I know beats their head against the wall about her but adores her books, regardless. She fulfills my secret need for some hella old school idea of masculinity, me man, me open bottle of wine and me pay for everything, you woman, you dress well, you sass well and you sex great , me happy. Lmaoooo"
14559,Penelope Douglas. She is it for me. I'll recommend Birthday Girl to anyone since I'm aware that my other favourites of her are not for everyone
14560,I read Punk 57 last week and oh boy it was great! I have Birthday Girl on my list. I love all the angst! Thank you 💜
14561,"This is cheating because I responded to the post yesterday with my pick, but I really don't miss an opportunity to recommend these books. Milla Vane's series A Gathering of Dragons fits every almost every request one could make. Do you like romances that feature a pet? We have a saber-tooth tiger, horses, and wolves. Do you like enemies to lovers? What about friends to lovers to enemies to lovers? Both are included! There is even a novella that features fated mates. If you like road trips, Vane has you covered.  If you want an LGBTQ friendly fantasy universe, people can marry whoever they want in this world. 

The only threads that I cannot recommend it to are those asking for children and people who like their romances smut free."
14562,"Artistic License by Elle pierson. It's got the following: 

Not your standard ""hot guy"" hero, he's rather conventionally ugly, but our heroine finds him fascinating. 

Sculptor heroine. As a sculptor myself, finding one represented in fiction thrills the heck outta me- so rare! 

An intriguing secondary plot that doesn't overtake the main plot or bog it down.

New Zealand setting

An overall feeling of sweetness 

Just.. worth a read. 💖"
14563,Shelter in Place by Nora Roberts has a sculptor heroine.
14564,Is this one of the trauma porn books you mentioned?
14565,Yes.  It was hideously boring.  You could probably skip to about 40% to get to the sculpting in Florence part.
14566,"I got Artistic License after your recommended it a couple months ago. Thank you so much!
It's a gem of a story, so lovely and satisfying."
14567,"Wonderful, I'm so happy!"
14568,No mention of how funny it is?🥺🥺🥺
14569,Nice! That looks great 💜
14570,"Love that book!  She's also known as Lucy Parker, and her London Celebrities series is fantastic and fun if you haven't read it."
14571,I think I'm two books in to that series 😊
14572,"Sherrilyn Kenyon and Tillie Cole. I'm always checking reviews even for authors I love, but these are the only two I can go in blind and know it's gonna be awesome!"
14573,Nice! I have read some of Sherilyn Kenyon but not Tillie Cole. I will add that to my list.
14574,Acheron is one of my top 10. The first half slays me.
14575,"Agreed! I've reread that book so many times over the years. Styxx too. I have to say for how much I hated Styxx in Acheron's book, she really managed to redeem him later on."
14576,"I second Sherrilyn Kenyon! I am currently rereading the whole dark hunter series right now (need to go faster, I'm only on Zarek's book), and then will hit up The League again."
14577,"{On The Island by Tracey Garvis Graves} is definitely my go-to for recommendations. I do hesitate sometimes because I’ve seen quite a few posts / comments where people have said they don’t like dual POV books, but I just love that book so much.

Also, I LOVED {One Day In December by Josie Silver} but it’s also dual POV. But I still love it and want to recommend it all the time."
14578,I actually really love dual POV 😳 so I might really enjoy One Day in December and On the Island

14580,"I always, always, ALWAYS want to recommend [The Widow of Rose House by Diana Biller](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250297853)!!

It was my most surprising read of the last year and I love it dearly. 

The heroine is a recent widow who has spent years fleeing scandal (and her abusive husband.) She is determined to restore this Gothic mansion in Gilded-Age New York, but OOPS there are ghosts. The hero, an eccentric (and hunky) scientist is itching to study the house's paranormal elements. Sparks fly. 

It sounds SO absurd but it has so much heart and is spooky and lovely."
14581,Hey I think it sounds great. Absurd can be awesome. I recently read some of Ice Planet Barbarians which sounded absurd but was actually quite fun to read. I will check this one out!
14582,Also this sounds great as a fall/Halloween read!
14583,OOOOOO spooky! Thanks I'm totally putting this on my Halloween reading :)
14584,"Jeaniene Frost’s Night Huntress series might be my all time favorite series. The first is Halfway to the Grave.

My other favorites are Pamela Clare’s historicals. She has two series set in early America and I adore them. The MacKinnon’s Rangers trio might be the better overall series, but Ride the Fire is my favorite book. When it comes down to it, it might be my favorite book of all time. It’s lovely and heartbreaking and hopeful and god I can read it over and over."
14585,I love your flair- my TBR is going to be out of control after this post as well. Eep! I will check these out. Thank you!
14586,"I love the JD Robb In Death series. 
I would love a friend to read it so we could compare thoughts and notes but it’s definitely a big commitment."
14587,Oooooooo Roarke...swoon! I agree it is a big commitment but the premise is so well done and cleverly organized.
14588,"Haha I am fangirling about JD Robb in this very thread right now with someone else, catch up with us there! We can gush abt this series together."
14589,"I’ve recommended Girl Gone Viral by Alisha Rai so much that I only need to write the first words and my phone suggests the rest. It doesn’t fit everything but I liked it for a bit older characters, bodyguard hero, some slow burn pining, heroine who actually likes other women, awkward sex and things like that."
14590,"Kennedy Ryan is queen.( Barring second book in her hoops series) I have absolutely loved all her books.
Emotional , strong heroine with plot that makes you think more deeply about the world. No one writes like her. Kingmaker and Grip series are my favorite."
14591,Awesome! I haven’t read any of her books so I will check out the series you mentioned. I lobe when the heroine is strong.
14592,"I’m always trying to push a few authors...Lauren Layne, Julie James, & Meghan Quinn! oh and my new favorite Joanna Shupe"

14598,"I just finished it yesterday because it's been recommended on this sub so much, and it was the best slow burn. So good."
14599,"The book I seem to be mentioning all around the internet lately is {Shortcake by Lucy Watson}. Its not even the most wonderful book I have ever read but it's so funny and i tend to comment on funny book suggestion posts the most often. 


I recommend the Fever Series by Karen M Moning everywhere. All the time. If you ask for a random series suggestion with no specifics, this is the one I will give you. If you ask for fantasy, I will recommend this. Alpha hero? Fever Series. Heroine that shows growth throughout the series? Fever Series. It's become a problem."

14601,Suzanne Brockmann and Rebekah Weatherspoon. Started reading Suz many many years ago. Still a favourite I go back to read again. Just discovered Rebekah and am totally hooked!
14602,"I love Suzanne Brockmann! And I don’t often go for contemporary or military, but somehow she gets it."
14603,"She does! I do prefer contemporary, but her male characters are human, flawed. It makes them more real to me."
14604,Rebekah Weatherspoon keeps popping up everywhere for me. I need to finally read one of her- which one did you like best?
14605,"On this board specifically, I feel like I recommend Mimi Matthews over and over and over, lol. Her historical romances are fade-to-black, which is typically not my taste at all, but she just writes with wonderful emotional depth and attention to detail. I also love her Pinterest boards for each book. My favorites of hers are probably **A Convenient Fiction** and **The Work of Art**.

Similar to this, I've been wanting to start a thread for ""books you love that don't get enough hype."" I have a couple books that I really enjoyed and always want to recommend, but I feel like they never quite fit in any threads!"
14606,I think that’s a great idea for a thread. You should start it! I have a few of those that don’t fit into typical request threads as well! Thank you!
14607,Update: It's looks like it's been asked before [a couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/g9w5yl/what_are_your_underappreciated_favorites/) [of times](https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/g9w5yl/what_are_your_underappreciated_favorites/)! But I'll keep looking for opportunities to hype my underappreciated faves. :)
14608,"Ah, ok! I actually don’t mind the repeat posts. Sometimes I will skip putting something on my list then see it again and reconsider. I especially don’t mind when there is discussion, it helps ‘sell’ me on something. 😊"
14609,"I feel like I’ve been recommending a lot of Chloe Liese lately. I really like the books I’ve read by her. The Bergman series is so great! 

Another is The One I Love to Hate by Amanda Weaver. This was the right book at the right time for me and I absolutely enjoyed it."
14610,"The Bergman series took me by surprise. It’s definite a new favorite of mine. Such a great recommendation, I love them!"
14611,I loved loved loved Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating and will be trying to shoehorn that into as many recommendation threads as I can.
14612,Haha! Thank you! I’m loving all of these recommendations and seeing what everyone enjoys. I’m so glad I did this post!
14613,"Author, not book, but I definitely pause a lot and think ""is this particular Sarina Bowen book *really* responsive, or do I just really like Sarina Bowen and want to smash one of her books until it fits the gap someone is asking for?""

I still recommend her a lot but hopefully I've held off on the inapplicable ones."
14614,"All I ever recommend is Kennedy Ryan books, Penny Reid and Psy changeling series by Nalini Singh. But they are all so good!"
14615,"\- Contemporary Romance: Archer's Voice by Mia Sheridan and The Law of Moses by Amy Harmon

😊"
14617,Anything with Lisa Kleypas I just adore her dialogue and smut scenese and characters so memorable 😄
14618,"For me it's definitely *The Simple Wild* and its sequel *Wild at Heart* by K.A. Tucker. It was the Alaska setting that got me to start, because I'm forever looking for books set in Alaska until I can finally go there myself, but beyond that, there are so many other things--a complicated relationship with parents, an enemies to lovers that feels believable in a contemporary setting without being silly or mean, a first kiss scene I re-read over and over, and a heroine who's flawed but relatable and still someone you can root for. In general I don't get excited about series where it's all just one couple, especially in contemporary where the storyline isn't necessarily plot-driven, but here I am counting down the days until the christmas novella.  

Chloe Liese's *Only When It's Us* is another one. That book took me completely by surprise and stole my heart, and I'm still shocked that such a total treasure of a book is on KU. I remember texting a friend about 30% of the way into it and telling her she had to read it, because I could just tell it was going to be wonderful.

When it comes to Sarina Bowen and Rebecca Yarros, I feel like I rec them both pretty often but mix it up with the actual books suggested a little more, maybe just because they have larger bodies of work? But you'll still find one of the two of them in pretty much every recommendation I give. From Sarina Bowen I'll forever suggest *The Year We Fell Down* as NA perfection, *Him* with Elle Kennedy for M/M, and the entirety of the True North series but especially *Bittersweet*. And from Rebecca Yarros, *Nova* (the Renegades #2) and *Full Measures* (Flight and Glory #1) are more NA series favorites (although they could be standalone if you wanted), while *Great and Precious Things* is a good standalone."
14619,"‘Men of Honor’ series by K.C Lynn. Pretty much all of her books are my favorite go-to. 
Natasha Madison and Aurora Rose Reynolds are also pretty much automatic downloads for me as well!"
14620,I absolutely love ARR!!!
14621,"I really wholeheartedly loved Strange Love by Ann Aguirre and want to constantly recommend it. Sweet beta alien hero, excellent communication, laugh out loud funny too. Radiance by Grace Draven has a lot of similarities for me and I also loved that."
14622,I love Beta heroes because it is so nice to change it up. I'm totally going to check this one out. Thank you!
14623,"* Flowers from the Storm by Laura Kinsale


It is so so good."
14624,"I like Sylvia Day, but more {Eve of Chaos} {Eve of War}  than the Crossfire series. Went off her a bit for the surprise extension to a trilogy."
14625,"Spotless by Camilla Monk! Probably one of my all-time favourites.  It's contemporary, involves international spies, subverts every classic romance trope, is absolutely hilarious, and has a cast to die for.  Highly rec always!!!"
14626,Yay! I love when tropes are subverted. Adding it to my list. Thank you!
14627,"If you like historicals set in other places than the UK, check out books by Chloe Flowers. The Hart Trilogy has to be read in order, but the 4th and 5th don’t. Lots of humor, action and romance. She really did her history homework!"
14628,"Suzanne Robinson. She was my favorite author for a long time. I recommend  [Lady Gallant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646199.Lady_Gallant?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=1) nearly every time there is a grovel thread, and [Lady Dangerous](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1332493.Lady_Dangerous_The_English_Gunslingers_Duet_1_?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=3) when people are looking for an independent, level-headed heroine. I hesitate to actually recommend my third favorite, [Lady Hellfire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2851469-lady-hellfire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=5), because although I love it, it has what I consider to be a serious flaw in the story (the Hero has *way* too many kinds of trauma going on)."
14629,Great! I will add Lady Dangerous to start because I like independent heroines. Thank you 💜
14630,"{{The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery}} is my go-to recommendation. I love it so much! 
{{Katherine by Anya Seaton}} is also another favorite."
14631,"Disclaimer: This recommendation is a world that has 3 series, and sort of 2 stand alone books shoved in randomly, but I do recommend reading the entire series of at least one Hh to understand it all :)

The entire Night Huntress world by Jeaniene Frost. I love all of the boos and have re-read multiple times. There are currently 3 main Hh combinations in this world: Cat and Bones, Clad and Leila, and Ian and Veritas. I would have a very hard time choosing which is my favorite. The only couple with books still being written though is Ian and Veritas.


Separately I still go back to Flatshare by Beth O’Leary a lot, it’s very sweet.

Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating by Christina Lauren despite me not loving other things I’ve read by them.


If you’re looking for absolutely pain and love I couldn’t put down In the Unlikely Event by LJ Shen."
14632,"This is so me! I find myself browsing requests that fit my favorite books just for an excuse to shamelessly recommend them all the time!

My all time faves are [Sugar Daddy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/306364.Sugar_Daddy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=otGXg5AD1h&rank=1) by Lisa Kleypas, most books by Sherry Thomas and Maggie Osborne. I recently picked up Beach Read and The Wall of Winnipeg and enjoyed both so I can see why they are so often recommended! I started going through Mariana Zapata's other books, and discovered I enjoyed [From Lukov with Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37683751-from-lukov-with-love) even more than I liked Winnipeg.

I'm a huge Sherry Thomas fan but her [Lady Sherlock](https://www.goodreads.com/series/176858-lady-sherlock) series was on my TBR shelf for the longest time, because I heard the romance aspect isn't the main focus. I finally decided to give them a try since they were included for free in Audible's new Plus catalog. I finished the first 2 books so fast and now I'm already on the 3rd one. It's true that they are more fade-to-black when it comes to sex scenes, but I feel the intimate character insight she follows up with makes up for it. Charlotte and Ash might be my new favorite couple of all time now. So much fun and so well written!"
14633,"I feel like I'm recommending Sylvia Day's Seven Years to Sin like every day on here! haha. One of my favorite historicals along with Lisa Kleypas' Again the Magic. And I like everything Sarah MacLean writes.  

For fantasy, I love love love Karen Marie Moning's Fever Series and I'm constantly recommending it as well as anything by Laura Thalassa whose male leads are just so evil and amazing. And of course ACOTAR (surprised to not see it mentioned).  

And for contemporary, I love TL Swan's The Stopover and Kresley Cole's Gamemaker series."
14634,"You know I'm with you on the AJH recommendations! Oh, you want a funny hero? Opposites attract? Academic setting? BDSM in a way that'll shake up your entire conception of what BDSM even is? Erotic baking/Domesticity porn? A character who's a mess? A character taking care of that person who is a mess? Arguments that don't descend into petty drama but are actually thoughtful and build character arcs? A well-thought-through side plot with realistic character growth as a result? A plausible ""and then the entire room clapped"" scene? A sweet parental relationship? A horrible parental relationship that doesn't get implausibly tidied up with a bow at the end? A ridiculous place-name that can't be real, but maybe it is real, so you effing google it and then shake your fist at AJH for bamboozling you into googling 'Pucklethroop-in-the-Wold?' A volume of puns that should actually be illegal? There is an AJH book for that!

Also I really want a ""I went to Pucklethroop-in-the-Wold and all I got was this t-shirt"" T-shirt, just saying. 

I would say the only other author I'm as obsessed about recommending is L.M. Montgomery. For some reason I keep trying to sell people on Anne of Windy Poplars, objectively probably one of the weakest books in the whole series, because it's epistolary. And The Blue Castle, whose mention always brings my one-woman hype crew to the subreddit. And Rilla of Ingleside, which I genuinely think is an awesome, fun yet heartbreaking novel.

Also I recently read The Flatshare and it made me weep and it was pretty much perfect. My buddy read was just a stream of incoherent raving about how much I loved it to Canquilt. So expect to be seeing that in every single thread.

Also Song of Achilles. Though it seems most people come here already obsessed with it and wanting to know what to read next, at which we can only collectively shrug and apologize that there is nothing else like it."
14635,"I read Rilla of Ingleside a ridiculous amount of times in high school.  Such a beautiful book!  Will never forget the baby in the soup tureen, such an image."
14636,I love all of your recommendations Eros! Since we tend to agree on books I am for sure checking out L.M Montgomery! Also the Flatshare is currently in my TBR. I might have to get to that one quick because it is so frequently mentioned as awesome. Thank you!!!!
14637,"I will warn you that Montgomery is a turn of the 20th century author, everything she writes is definitely closed-door, and she's very old-fashioned, but she was also pretty progressive for her time, so her books aren't horrifyingly misogynistic or anything. I grew up reading her and read everything she ever wrote (minus her private diaries, but literally all her novels and short stories) so I'm kind of biased. Anne of Green Gables is pretty much my fave fish-out-of-water comedy/coming of age story of all time."
14638,"Wait. Wait! Yes, I have read all of Anne of Green Gables series. Even the ones from when she was older. I just didn’t connect the dots because I was thinking more contemporary. Seriously, Anne if Green Gables is the reason I am a “reader” Did she write anything else besides that main series?"
14639,"Oh goodness, I knew there was a reason we were sympatico! 

Yes! She wrote a LOT more. But the quality varies. 

The Blue Castle is her only ""adult"" romance. A woman with a heart condition who has been told it's fatal works up the gumption to ask her crush, who is barely an acquaintance, to marry her for convenience's sake, to escape her horrible family. It's super adorable and I've been intending a reread for awhile. 

There's the Emily trilogy. This was Montgomery's attempt to write a more ""serious"" self-insert who also aspired to be an author like she did. Like Anne, it's about an orphaned girl sent to live with older, conservative people who struggles with adapting to their lifestyle, though eventually they all get along. It lacks a lot of the comedy of Anne, and sometimes Emily is an annoying cool girl who's too good for everyone and is self-consciously beautiful as well, groan. Her struggles as a writer are sometimes really a lot and feel a bit gratuitous, all this stuff about her art and not sacrificing ideals and whatever. Actual Montgomery was romantic but extremely practical about her work, writing what would sell because she had to, and so maybe this was a bit of venting some leftover idealism for her.

 What is really fun are the friend squad interactions. Emily's bestie, Ilse, is the complete opposite of Diana Barry in AOGG, and it's super fun - she's outlandish and crazy, they argue like nuts, and love each other a lot. Perry, the farm labourer turned academic star turned politician, is this wonderful mix of declasse and clever and his dialogue with Emily has so much intellectual chemistry. Emily's love interest, Teddy, is boring AF, unfortunately, and they don't interact much. But there's another love interest, Dean Priest, who...well, he certainly comes across as creepy in 2020, because he falls for the adolescent Emily as a full-grown adult and decides to be in her life to see if she's eventually interested in being with him, which, EW, but teen me thought that was very romantic indeed. He's a snarky, unconventional, not very attractive smart guy and I just really liked him even if he's not always the best guy. Anyway, those are worth a try! 

The Story Girl is another two-volume episodic work, collecting, as the title suggests, stories surrounding island farm life, mostly generated by a group of children consisting of siblings and cousins. It's told from a young man's perspective and IMHO it's one of her stronger young adult books. The general idea of this book series, a group of kids led by a charismatic, imaginative young woman into small town misadventures, is what eventually became the ""Road to Avonlea"" Canadian TV series of the 90s. (There's a Montgomery short story collection called ""Road to Avonlea,"" but the premise of this family in the Story Girl books, IIRC, is the foundation of the show, and the short story series compiles various tales from the lives of everyone in the Canadian small town without a central cast of characters). The direction of that show was extremely saccharine and family values-oriented in a way that didn't quite respect the humor and sharpness of Montgomery's best work, IMHO. 

There's Pat of Silver Bush, and Magic for Marigold, Jane of Lantern Hill,  in which Montgomery deploys the ""smart girl on a farm/isolated environment, living with older relatives"" trope thing again, and they aren't super memorable - more like alternate takes on familiar territory. 

Oh! There's a couple other new-adult-ish romance books. Kilmeny of the Orchard is about guy crushing after a mute girl who plays the violin beautifully. It's kind of cute - I don't remember it super well, though teen me was extremely into the whole ""forbidden love/barrier to communication/shutaway"" thing. And A Tangled Web, some crazy melodramatic multigenerational family curse story that resolves with several romances. I have been meaning to reread this, since I read it as a kid when I was too young to cotton to some grownup marriage drama plot. But when Montgomery goes serious, it often falls quite flat, and I suspect this is the case here."
14640,"Well Met by Jen DeLuca is one of my favs to recommend! (Believable) Enemies to lovers trope, normal people with normal problems and normal lives, largely based at a Renaissance faire - which I wasn’t sure I’d like but I thought I’d give it a shot. And loved it! I actually bought the paperback AND the e-version because I love it so much."
14641,Loved this book! Can't wait for the next in the series!
14642,Loved it! I thought it was do fresh and didn't expect to like it as much as I did.
14643,Defying the odds by kele moon!
14644,"Mine is partly because I've never once seen it rec'd here, but also because it's one of my favourite series ever. [The Jacobite Chronicles by Julia Brannan.](https://www.goodreads.com/series/177357-the-jacobite-chronicles)

It's a 6 book series following the same characters - a really good mix of historical fiction and romance set in 18th century England & Scotland."
14645,"{All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Brynn Greenwood} and {Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens} both of which I consider romance and are two of my absolute favorites, but others may understandably classify in a different genre. 

Also, {Making Faces}, {Running Barefoot}, and {A Different Blue}, all by Amy Harmon."
14646,"I have two fantasy authors that I want to recommend all the time, Elise Kova and Kayleigh Nicol.

Kova is what not only got me hooked on romance books, but also got me back into reading after a rather long reading slump. There is so much stuff in the *Air Awakens* universe that I like and want to explore more of.

I think Nicol writes some of the best characters out there period, and I really want to know what happens to them. And I really wish the short story *Storm Front* (part of the *Mage-Born Anthology)* was a full-length novel. It's so adorable!"
14647,One of my oldest favourites {Just the way you are by Christina Dodd} and I really love Vanessa Gray Bartal books like her {Won't you be my neighbor by Vanessa  Gray Bartal} and all her characters seem to be exceptionally quirky!

14649,"What a fun thread!  Thanks for feeding my TBR :)

I would say Cat Sebastian's Sedgwick series, I adore the whole thing.  The first book, It Takes Two to Tumble, is a gay regency Sound of Music, it is perfection."
14650,"Anything written by Julie James. Her females are strong, sassy and snarky. I especially like her FBI series."
14651,"Historical romance - The Malory series by Johanna Lindsey, but only the first 7 books. The 8th book onwards seems like an artificial attempt to stretch the magic of the seven books, but nah, doesn't quite capture the same magic. The first 7 books though, woww! They are amazing. And I have recommended this series quite a few times in this group. And I've said this before too, when my sister and I first read them, we used to discuss about the Malory clan so much that our mum once thought we were talking about some close family members and asked which relatives we were talking about. 
Not many people seem to recommend Johanna Lindsey, I don't know why. But she does have some superb works. Her other series like the Cardinia Family series (2 works), Sherring Cross series (3 works) and quite a few stand alone novels are really good. If and when you get the time after wading through the amazing works recommended till now, do give The Malory Clan a try. They won't disappoint, I promise!"
14653,"I like Jill Shalvis as my easy/comfort read when you want something light (I can imagine these on the Hallmark channel). But it's a bit like going down the rabbit hole as you'll find yourself sucked into the series! I recommend the Wilder Series, the Cedar Ridge series and Second Chance Summer."
14654,Thanks everyone for the wonderful suggestions today! This was fun and I now have the longest TBR ever. I hope it was helpful for others as well 💜😊🎉
14655,"{The Flatshare by Beth O’Leary} for contemporary and {A Wicked Kind of Husband by Mia Vincy} for historical. I’m like a broken record around here for these two books.

It warms my heart to see an AJH mention and this much love in the wild. (I’m not part of a cult or anything, \*surreptitiously looks around\*, nope, not me)"
14656,"Asking for an audio recommendation?  Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark read by Robert Petkoff.  Asking for a paranormal?  Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark read by Robert Petkoff.  Asking for a bonkers series?  Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark read by Robert Petkoff.  Podcast?  Listen to Fated Mates Season 1 where they talk about Kresley Cole’s Immortals After Dark, and you should listen to the audio version read by Robert Petkoff.  I’m still working my way through the series, but I am constantly mentioning it when people asks for recommendations."
14657,"Okay, I've read a lot of romance novels in the past few years, and I have some favorites.

First off, a lot of books are poorly written and not particularly imaginative, but I tend to enjoy the genre regardless because I'm guaranteed a happy ending. That being said, I think you should define what you mean by 'best' - do you want stuff that's creative and doesn't fall into the same common tropes that all romance novels have? Do you want something that's ""well-written"" (whatever that may mean)? Do you want solid characters who go through personal growth throughout the book?

Anyway, I looked at the synopsis of Searching for Always, and I must say that I would never read that book (unless I was in a situation where it was the only thing to read). It sounds like it takes itself entirely too seriously, which is never a good thing in a romance novel. Part of the reason why I love the genre is that it's utterly absurd and the authors know it. 

I have a few favorites, and I'll describe them and why I think they're so great. (Also, a quick aside about terminology - the heroine is the female protagonist, the hero the male. ""HEA"" is happily-ever-after). Anyway, here's the list:

* [**The Windflower** by Laura London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/679702.The_Windflower). This book is a bit of a behemoth at 540 pages, and takes a little while to get to the action, but I like it because it's so utterly full of tropes and ridiculousness.  Our heroine, Merry Wilding (no shit that's her name) is the traditional innocent-doesn't know she's beautiful-naive-excessively exuberant type of heroine. Through several inexplicable events, she ends up on a pirate ship. The story wends its way through some unbelievable shenanigans before landing at its HEA. This book also lightly touches on a few historical events, as it's set during the War of 1812. Unfortunately, it was written 1984, so it's solidly Old Romance and has a few of the less appetizing tropes of the era (i.e. poorly defined consent).

* [**The Iron Duke** by Meljean Brook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7864587-the-iron-duke). I would classify the subgenre of this book as ""steampunk romance"". Our heroine, Mina Wentworth, is one of the very few female detectives in a steampunk Victorian London. The hero is Rhys Trahaearn, the man who stopped the Horde from the continuing to enslave the population of England (the book explains this far better than I am now). Rhys is also a bit of a hermit, shunning the adoration of the crowds for a solitary life on his estate. Somehow a body is dropped on his estate, and Mina is called in to investigate. If you thought The Windflower sounded ridiculous, this book beats it. At one point Mina rappels out of an airship over open water to shoot a kraken with a harpoon gun. There are also zombies, and a surprising level of social commentary regarding racism and poverty. Somehow, the romance is enhanced rather than overshadowed by the elaborate setting. If you're okay with some suspension of disbelief, and books that laugh at themselves, I would definitely recommend this one.

* [**A Night to Surrender** by Tessa Dare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10429836-a-night-to-surrender). This book is an example of the more traditional historical romance, but with a decidedly modern bent. It's also the first book of the Spindle Cove series, which is set in a picturesque little English town where spinsters and the painfully shy ladies of the Regency period go to hide from marriage. I'm not sure if I'd say that it's my favorite in my series (I'd say that honor belongs to the second book, A Week to Be Wicked) but it's a good place to start. The heroine of the story is Susanna Finch, self-appointed leader of the spinsters. The hero and part-time villain is Victor Bramwell, assigned by the Regent to start a militia in the town. Susanna and Victor but heads and then other body parts. It's a delightful read, and well-illustrates the modern approach to the historical romance.

* [**Burn for Me** by Ilona Andrews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20705702-burn-for-me). I think I'm cheating a bit by including this, because there's no HEA (it's a series in progress) yet, but I love this book and it has more romance than it should. Our heroine, Nevada Baylor, is a private detective charged with bringing in an exceedingly dangerous man. When I say dangerous, I mean that this is a magical universe and the guy can control fires. Nevada fortunately has magical powers of her own, but in order to finish the job she enlists the help of Connor Rogan, the most magically powerful ~~bachelor~~ man in the country (also a bit of a hermit; that's kind of a thing with romance). Sparks fly (hah), things get steamy (literally and figuratively), and the next book comes out in 19 days. I'm mentioning this book here because it has a fair amount of romance (and a decidedly romantic cover) but is also extremely fast-paced and engrossing.

* [**Rock Addiction** by Nalini Singh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22839846-rock-addiction). Before I describe this book, I want to say that Nalini Singh has two FANTASTIC paranormal romance series (the Angel series and the Psy-Changeling series) but I've already talked about two other pararom books and I need to add a contemporary romance one. This book is standard rock-star romance - hero is a rock star, heroine is an ordinary girl who just wants to stay out of the spotlight. It's possible that I enjoyed this book for the smut more than for the plot, but that sometimes happens. Anyway, this is a very cute book (I'd even use the word 'sweet'), and delivers its HEA right on schedule.

* [**Servant of the Crown** by Melissa McShane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25777000-servant-of-the-crown). Sorry, the list was missing a proper fantasy romance, so here it is. In this book, the heroine is Alison Quinn, a bookselling/ printing Countess who just wants to sell books (dammit). Regrettably, her title comes with certain responsibilities, and she's called to the capital city to spend a year as a lady-in-waiting for the Queen's dowager mother. At her first ball, she unintentionally catches the eye of the 'playboy' prince Anthony (the Queen's brother), he drunkenly hits on her, she slaps him and causes a scene, and as punishment they are forced to show the public that there is no animosity between them. This cordiality is shown in the form of public outings together, and they naturally start to fall for each other. I added this book because there's some real maturation for both Alison and Anthony, and because the second half has a fantastic plotline (involving the Royal Library) that runs alongside the romance. The book is not without its faults (the Big Misunderstanding of the novel was a favorite for teen movies in the 90s) but it's good enough that just writing this synopsis made me want to reread it.

If you tell me the sorts of books you usually like, I could give you a more specific recommendation. Also, I only read the first of the Death books by J.D.Robb (Nora Roberts) and wasn't interested in reading further, so you're not the only one to have given up on that series.

Finally, I don't think I can even get started on the worst ones I've read (50 shades comes to mind) because there are so many that are truly awful. Sorry about that :)

edit: I have no self-control and added another book.

edit2: I forgot about a few. Honorable mentions to Warprize by Elizabeth Vaughn, Paper Princess by Erin Watt, Bad Boys Do by Victoria Dahl, The Royal We by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, Trade Me by Courtney Milan, and Three Wishes by Kristen Ashley. I'm not going to claim that all of these are objectively good, but I absolutely loved them all.

Also, for the record, I read 124 romance novels last year."
14658,"Okay thanks for the list!

I'm going to check those out soon."
14659,No problem :) also I will hold no hard feelings against you if you don't like them. Romance is a bit of an acquired taste :P
14660,"> First off, a lot of books are poorly written and not particularly imaginative, 

This is really what I was wondering. 

I was also wondering, if this is what they publish, how awful are the things they *don't* publish?"
14661,"Well, ""publish"" is a tricky word right now because there's SO MUCH romance being self-published, and I think most of my experience with absolutely terrible stuff is from self-published authors. There are some publishers/ imprints that (in my opinion) don't really care about how well a book is written, and for which the editing standards are rather lax. If a publisher offers some sort of club where you receive 3 romance novels a month, they're probably focusing more on quantity than quality. Some even have really specific requirements for their authors, which further constrains creativity and enforces uniformity. I usually have good luck with Avon books, and the opposite with Harlequin, but I can't say for certain that that's a rule and not just luck of the draw.

Also, re self-publishing, there are some good authors who eschew publishing houses and don't suffer for it. I *think* Courtney Milan is a good example of this, though I'm not positive that she's independent."
14662,"I love Catherine Coulter's regency books. She's gotten away from them in recent years, sadly. May Balough is another good writer, as is Teresa Medeiros.

I enjoy Regency era romances the most of all. The worst books to me tend to be ones that have a contemporary setting. I want the escapism! 

As a generality, I would say to stay away from Nora Roberts. Her books in particular are just... dreck... She's too big name of an author to edit properly, imho, and she churns out so many books that she's lost any spark of originality or character in her writing."
14663,So accurate on Nora Roberts. Her books are rather bland for my taste too!
14664,"""Dreck"" is the perfect word for how I feel about Nora Roberts and certain other excessively prolific romance writers. The quantity completely destroys the quality."
14665,"> Catherine Coulter's regency books

Have you read Georgette Heyer? How does Coulter compare?"
14666,"I don't think I've read Heyer. If I have , she didn't stand out enough to me."
14667,"Try her - as far as Regency romances go, she's as good as it gets (assuming you're not looking for anything overtly steamy)."
14668,"I like romance, but I am sooooo incredibly picky about them that I probably can't even consider myself a romance reader. Actually, my favorites probably aren't even considered ""true"" romance, but what the heck. I'll try to think of more later, but probably my top two are Jane Eyre and The Time Traveler's Wife."
14669,"I am a sucker for fantasy romance novels^myguiltypleasureisanythingwrittenbySherrilynKenyon......  

I've read Nora Roberts (randomly found a few at a vacation house when there was nothing else around) but I agree with screaming_buddha that her books aren't particularly good."
14670,"I love paranormal romance. I am a big fan of J.R Ward and Sherrilyn Kenyon. They have great stories and some saucy scenes in their books. 

For some soft easy reading, I pick up Debbie Macomber or anything really. Id choose her if you are modest, but still like a touch of pda. 

I read a ton of romance! It's my go to genre really.



I think the worst would have to be 50 shades of grey series by E.L. James. It is just basic at best. There are a couple more authors I can pile in with her but I don't remember their names!"
14671,"I love JR Ward's Blackdagger Brotherhood series! And the Blackdagger Legacy seems to be coming along alright as well. I love that there's a bigger overall storyline than the romance aspect of the books. And said storyline is actually good enough so far that if the romance parts were taken out, there'd still be a good book leftover. 

I was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to really get into The Bourbon Kings though. I heard such good things, but it just wasn't for me. Too much drama, I think."
14672,"So I read the first and got half way through the second before I had to give up. The first was WAY too fast paced for me! Felt like all the events in the book were crammed and not well thought out. I thought the second one would be better and I was wrong, her books are normally great and I am really enjoying The Chosen at the moment. But I agree with you on The Bourbon Kings series . It doesn't feel like she put much heart into it for me. The drama is even kind of lame to me which sucks because she is my favorite romance author."
14673,"[The Raven Prince by Elizabeth Hoyt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28863.The_Raven_Prince?ac=1&from_search=true)

14674,My favorite one is the argeneau series by Lynsay Sands!
14675,"I tried to read one of these and just couldn't get into it. I think the problem was that I started on the 9th book :P

I take it that you recommend the series, though?"
14676,"Georgina Heyer is pretty good although she comes with all of the racism/antisemitism etc of the 1930s. She did regency novels. *Marriage of Convenience* was a favorite.

Mary Stewart I really loved. Her books feature smart heroines who have no problem taking care of themselves and who also aren't flat characterization. I love anything she's ever written.


The all time worst book that I remember reading is tied between JP Monninger's new book *The Map That Leads To You* and *The Star Witch* by Linda Winstead Jones. In the first one the author writes like a college student and worse than Stephenie Meyer or EL James. The leading man is  cookie-cutter bland and the leading lady is also bland and is the sort of person who talks about her inner goddess with her friends who are also stereotypes and there for the diversity count.  WITCH has a ripped guy who looks at a woman and imagines her naked when they first meet. The woman slutshames a lot and is also a ""strong woman"" because she can fight with swords or something. I wound up cutting it up for an art project. 

I've found the shittiest romances usually involve a lot of stereotypes about women and men; the frigid ice queen woman, the guy who isn't interested in women after his last girlfriend burned him, the set-up that excites passion (they get wet, she sees him doing something manly like kill spiders for her, he gets shirtless...) are all tropes that appear."
14677,"I think i've read a few over the years, and my all time favorite will be **P.S: I Love You by Cecelia Ahern**. The thing I mostly don't like is that they are kind of predictable and sometimes way too cheesy, and also, if I read them in spanish the translation seems to suck and be very cringey which I can't stand, because it's probably translated to be hispanic neutral or something."
14678,Do you like Sci Fi romance?
14679,"not OP but I like SciFi romance :) 

Do you have recommendations?"
14680,"I liked the In Death series. It's very formulaic and becomes a bit repetitive, so I am very slowly reading the series. As in it's been 2 years and I've finished 9 of the books.

My favourites for romance are **Outlander**, anything by **Christina Lauren**, the **Mastered** series by Lorelei James, and **The Hating Game** by Sally Thorne. Oh and for cheesy sweet romance that's better than Nora Roberts, I like a few series by Jill Shalvis, like **Lucky Harbor** and **Animal Magnetism**. 

All of my favourites have quality writing, hunky heroes, and reasonably believable relationships."
14681,Ya I love it. You def need to go in order though cause they all use things from the previous books
14682,"I think you replied to the original post and not my comment :P

This is about the Argeneau series, right?"
14683,"I've never read a romance book, but I did see a book by Fabio at a library once. It was called The Pirate. I turned to a random page and read a bit. The abysmal writing (think slow fifth grader) and clumsy dialogue was worth a good laugh. Also some weird rapey vibes that really made the experience a surreal one."
14684,"Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, one of my favorite books. Really explores Russian family life and relationships. 

If you want a fucked up, non traditional romance novel check out Lolita by Nabokov. Beautifully written. 

Then again, if you want a feel-good read maybe these are best avoided."
14685,"Lolita is an unparalleled masterpiece, but unless you're talking about Humbert's relationship with Humbert, I wouldn't go all Vanity Fair on its ass."
14686,"Haha I guess it just depends on what you mean by ""romance"". There is definitely some passion there, albeit one-sided."
14687,I normally don't care for romance novels but love The Time Traveler's Wife.
14688,"I, too, am not much of a romantic... But The Time Traveler's Wife intensified the fuzzies in my belly."
14689,I'm not a romance reader but I came here to say this too. Amazing book.
14690,"a farewell to motherfucking arms.

I cry everytime. Dat walk in the rain."
14691,"Yep. That was the most depressing ending I've ever read. I almost cried, but held back the tears out of fear that Papa would burst out of another dimension with an army of lions to punish me for my unmanly lack of dignity under pressure."
14692,"I'm not much for romance, but I thoroughly enjoyed [One Day](http://amzn.com/0307474712) by David Nicholls."
14693,"Stardust by Neil Gaiman. 

Most incredible adventure love story ever."
14694,"I can't say enough good things about this book! I converted a new English speaker to a book lover with this book. It really is magical.

In all fairness, the only other book she'd ever finished or read was Le Mis, and she thought she hated ALL books because of how rough that was."
14695,".... Not a single book suggested on here has actually been a romance novel. Much as I love The Time Traveler's Wife and many of the classic novels people have suggested here.

If your friend likes to read ""romance novels"" she'd probably be most comfortable with an actual book from that genre!  She'd also be annoyed that you characterized it as ""run of the mill"" and ""cliche"".  Romance novels, like a sonnet, adhere to a stricter structure than most novels but that doesn't make their repetitive patterns a cliche. 

That said, I'd go with something by Nora Roberts (she's the biggie for a reason) and if you can find one of them, Honest Illusions and Sweet Revenge are two of her best stand alone novels.

She might also like something a little more ""chic-lit""-y, in which case I'd suggest anything by Marian Keyes or a fantastic novel called Bridget Jones Diary. But once again, those are not romance novels in the most traditional sense of the word, and will give you a  different experience.

Edit: Outlander, mentioned below, is the closest thing here to an actual romance novel, although as the suggester said, it spreads out into a series that is clearly just historical. It's also really long so if your friend isn't much of a brain she might be intimidated. If she can handle it though, Jamie and Claire will probably be some of the best book friends she'll ever make!"
14696,"Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. If she's a serious reader, she can get into it enough to fall in love with the characters when it's not really a ""romance"" for like 100 pages... But it's not clearly ANY genre, but all. It's also a series, and she will love you for the introduction forever. I didn't think I liked these types of books at all, but these books kinda transcend genre because they have crazy settings, and AMAZING characters. Historical, funny, romantic, and mysterious."
14697,"Wuthering Heights, one of the absolute best that will haunt you a life time."
14698,"Rebecca, by Daphne DuMarier. (I'm on my phone, can't check the spelling.) It's a mystery tinged with romance. Very suspenseful. A great read."
14699,"I never would have considered Rebecca a romance when I read it, though it's been some time. The semantics of it's classification aside, I agree that it's a great mystery and psychological thriller."
14700,"I did this for a university english class. It had minimal romance, but the Narrator's love for her husband was so loyal and beautiful."
14701,Why do you say that?? Because she constantly pushed her doubts about him out of her mind until the very end??
14702,"Love In The Time Of Cholera.

One if the best books I've ever read, and my usual fare is sci fi and high fantasy. It makes you feel the life-filling power of love in its many different faces."
14703,This 100 000 times
14704,Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre
14705,more so Jane Eyre
14706,Another vote for Pride and Prejudice! I want that to be my life so hard!
14707,"It's a pretty tough read, but after getting over the semantics, I gotta say, it was one of the best novels i've read in a while."
14708,The Time Traveler's Wife
14709,"Rebecca is wonderful, though I'd class it as more mystery than romance, personally. The movie version, directed by Hitchcock is great too!

 If you want to get your friend something more modern, [ Smart Bitches, Trashy Books](http://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/) is the best site for romance reviews and related snark."
14710,I've heard good things about *Cotillion* by Georgette Heyer.
14711,"Well, yes, anything by Georgette Heyer. Discovering Heyer is kind of like finding out that Austen wrote fifty more books that no one told you about."
14712,"Her period romances are great, but her mysteries are not nearly as good. Everything I dislike about Agatha Christie's books, and none of the redeeming features."
14713,"Ah, noted. I'm not a mystery reader, so avoiding them won't be any hardship. Thanks!"
14714,*Of Human Bondage* by Maugham. The greatest story of the pain of a passionate first love.
14715,"Gone With the Wind is a good epic. Also, Women in Love by D.H.Lawrence."
14716,"I should also mention that they love mysteries. I'm afraid of asking too many questions because I don't want to lead them into knowing I am getting it for them.

The Rebecca suggestion seems like a good one so far."
14717,Maybe 1q84 would be good for you then!
14718,"1Q84 is interesting, but it is terribly slow and draggy."
14719,And excessively repetitive.
14720,"If they like mystery AND romance, definitely Sebastian St. Cyr mysteries. It's a series, by C.S. Harris, who is also a romance novelist, and it shows. The mysteries are engaging and well thought-out (with the exception of the latest book, I think), and the romance plots I found to be satisfying."
14721,"I believe the official genre for Rebecca is ""romantic suspense."" Read it about a week ago, seems pretty accurate."
14722,"*Women*, by  Charles Bukowski.  Trust me, it's a perfect Romance book."
14723,HA.
14724,"I wrote the modern-day version, City of Singles

http://cityofsingl.es"
14725,"The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson. 

I wouldn't say it was explicitly a romance novel but it has a very strong romance/love storyline. Just to give you a preview, the books follows the main character (I don't think you ever know his name) who gets very seriously burned in a car accident during the first couple of chapters. The book follows his recovery in the burn ward (very graphic but very good and honestly one of my favorite parts) where he meets a woman named Marianne who, over the course of the book, retells the story of *their* past life (as in they knew other in their past lives - and by past I mean medieval Germany) and also 3 other amazing stories which also have kind of a love theme. 

I definitely recommend it. To my knowledge, Davidson has not written anything since and I think it's because he is very detail oriented. He spent years researching burn units and all different aspects of medieval Germany in addition to everything else the book includes over the course of many years."
14726,"Possession by A. S. Byatt

Mary Stewart had some great romantic suspense books, Wildfire at Midnight, Nine Coaches Waiting and My Brother Michael were some of my favorites.

Gone With the Wind is a classic likewise Forever Amber"
14727,"Brokeback Mountain, Little Women, Time Traveller's Wife, Romeo and Juliet, I might think of more later..."
14728,The Lover by Margarette Duras and the Kindness of Women by J.G. Ballard.
14729,Georgette Heyer!
14730,Conversion by s.c. stephens.
14731,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundra 

I'll also second Time Traveler's Wife and Love in the Time of Cholera"
14732,How come nobody has mentioned Lolita yet. . .
14733,"These two books (and authors) convinced me to give the romance genre more of a look...well-written, good characterizations of both the male and the female lead, funny, and actually romantic:

Jennifer Crusie [Bet Me](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/854757.Bet_Me)

Jill Shalvis [Instant Attraction](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5392768-instant-attraction)"
14734,"I gotta go with my all-time fave, Pride and Prejudice."
14735,"I agree. While mostly all I care about in a quick book is the main characters and plot, Pride & Prejudice has such a richer story. It's not a quick read, even if it's not super long."
14736,Came here to say this.  It's just so good.
14737,"Alexis Hall is funny and lyrical (and has great dialogue), KJ Charles also has great dialogue, Rose Lerner never disappoints."
14738,Maybe not the best book I've ever read but certainly the best author is Alexis Hall. His writing is just... something else. I cannot believe all that talent exists in one person.
14739,"Anything by Georgette Heyer - they are so rereadable and satisfying, every detail is pitch perfect"
14740,Love The Grand Sophy!
14741,"I second all the Alexis Hall recommendations. His writing style is just impeccable 

I also really like Kate Clayborn. Love Lettering has some amazing imagery/scenery."
14742,"I'd have to go with Wolfsong by TJ Klune.  And then Exhale by Joel Abernathy.

I thinking more about prose, dialogue, themes, use of metaphors.  Less about plot and characters.  I guess more about how the story was written instead of the story itself."
14743,"Beautifully written romance books and why I believe they are well written (I couldn’t pick one!)

Radiance by grace draven: talk about a short book that packed a punch.. there was not a sentence wasted in this book, every sentence moved the story forward, the prose was beautiful, and the book left me feeling completely satisfied with the plot.. wouldn’t change a thing. 
(BONUS- also has my favorite sex scene in any book, it really showed the true meaning of “making love”)

The last hour of gann by R lee smith:  very very long but it has incredible world building as the story moved along.  As opposed to a lot of books that take half the book to just describe the world to the reader and then move the story forward, the last hour of gann moves along in a nice pace while giving the reader a feel for the surrounding world matching the plot. For a book this size, it also doesn’t waste a single sentence, and you are left in a daze when completed (the tie in at the end to the 1000 pages of plot.. wow wow wow)
Note: would not recommend this to beginners reader, it is not the most easy read. Midlevel to expert readers rejoice! 

Ps: thanks to this sub I discovered my two all time favorite romance books :)"
14744,"YES to the Last Hour of Gann! I read it for the first time in January and I am still thinking over scenes in my mind. I’ve read some of the other R. Lee Smith books (loved Cottonwood) but this one, oh this one. It shattered my heart and then put it back together so many times. Number one on my romance list for sure ❤️."
14745,"{Wait for it by Mariana Zapata} I just love all the characters and the slow burn. I read it about once a year and always love it, it's one of my comfort reads!"
14746,"It's one of my comfort reads, too. And fairly frequent rereads. Sometimes more than annually!"
14747,"I just read it again on Thursday and I was keeping a cry count lol. Cried 5 times, teared up around 10, and lost count how many times I laughed out loud.

I love that story so much! The whole thing is so perfect."

14750,Wow this sound right up my ally.. have never heard if this book. Is it open or closed door?
14751,I love Julie Ann Long’s Pennyroyal Green series. I love the way she writes. It’s so descriptive! She throws in realism here and there. She focuses on the emotional aspects and digs deep.
14752,Yes I was going to say What I Did for a Duke. Some of the most beautifully poetic writing I’ve read that still manages to not be too flowery

14754,"Came to say this. Best romance I’ve ever read hands down. It was my gateway book that got me into the genre. I haven’t put them down since! Christian and Maddie are such nuanced multi-layered characters and you get to watch them slowly fall in love. I also loved how different they are but how good they are for each other. His speech at the end, oof. Maddie girl, sigh. ❤️"

I highly recommend the audiobook too because the narrator, Nicholas Boulton, doss an amazing job. He really brings Christian and his struggles to life!"

14757,Flowers From the Storm by Laura Kinsale.

14764,"I thought the plot was excellent, but I just couldn't enjoy the writing :("
14765,I had a slightly different take - the writing was great but geez her characters were not good. That was a terrible heroine.
14766,Lord of Scoundrels by Loretta Chase is hard to beat for me!
14767,"I second this.. This was amongst the earliest romance novels I read and inspite of a decade of reading hundreds of romances, this one stays my favorite."
14768,"Bet Me and crazy for you by Jennifer Crusie. Funny, poignant and hot and so well written. I haven’t found that combo in ages"
14769,"I was checking comments to see if anyone had recommended Bet Me. The structure is so good, and Cruise builds out a believable world really fast. The characters feel like real people (I recognize this is not always the goal in romance, but it is enjoyable in this one). Really one of my favorites ever."
14770,I was meh about Well Met and you have made me want to read Bet Me.
14771,"I recently discovered Kerrigan Byrne and I’m so impressed with her beautiful language. I just finished The Duke With the Dragon Tattoo (disregard dumb title) and she wrote a dark villainous angsty piney antihero soooooo well. Think Heathcliff but not toxic. I’d also recommend anything by Madeline Miller. She writes some of the most gorgeous prose, period, independent of genre."
14772,Yes! I’m loving her writing style. She really fleshes out her characters. In the middle of The Highwayman (because of this sub) and it’s just so detailed and angsty and emotionally descriptive!!!! :D
14773,Wow!! I follow her on Instagram even though I never read any of her books. But this one looks soo interesting!! Thanks for the recommendation!
14774,"It's romance adjacent and it doesn't have a HEA, but Call Me By Your Name"
14775,Okay I was actually considering reading this! The film adaptation was ruined for me by Armie Hammer :x
14776,Armie Hammer is losing his damn mind.
14777,Oh my gosh I didn’t even think about that until now what the heck!! The movie has like the most realistic angst I’ve ever seen and I love it— gave me all the stomach butterflies. Ugh. Ruined.
14778,It's a very beautiful if weird novel. The film is a pretty loyal adaption.
14779,I loved Radiance by Grace Draven.
14780,"That was such a rich story with an amazing love. The fact that he kept talking about how ugly she was with her weird eyes that had pupils was hilarious. Or the fact that she could threaten him with a potato.  Goodness, I love that book series"
14781,"I really loved it because I like to think that I would act the way they did if I were in their shoes. I sometimes get irritated at books that have the sassy young heroines who act in a way that I think an adult person would not. But yes, radiance is such a wonderful book."
14782,Came here to say this as well - Grace Draven is a phenomenal writer!
14783,"{Sunshine by Robin Mckinley} 

The way that McKinley writes is the perfect amount of detail for me. It's lyrical without being belaboring. Many authors describe very little of the scene, while others go overboard and are too descriptive (I don't want to know the exact playlist for every scene...). Mckinley harnesses our understanding of the everyday and blends it with her extraordinary fantasy setting. For example, most people know what a bakery looks and smells like. Mckinley leans into that but then also demonstrates why this bakery is very special. It's just the perfect amount of detail in every regard, very unique."
