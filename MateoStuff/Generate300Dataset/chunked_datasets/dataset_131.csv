I obviously can't compare the original to Soderbergh's, but as its own thing, it's a truly hypnotic film. Worth giving it another go."
42054,I saw the original first. Might have felt different if that had been switched. Solaris is one of my all time favorites and I recommend getting a DVD or Bluray if there aren't indie theaters near you that project it on film. Tarkovsky deserves better than Youtube compression.

It has nothing to do with New York as a place of artificially inflated interest. It simply comes down to the fact that a lot of people who make art live in New York. And naturally, much of that is inspired by the city itself."

The it less open-ended than Inception and Memento.  Think [Primer (not on streaming in US)](http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Primer/60034782?strkid=898102203_0_0&strackid=3806ec3d87c89e84_0_srl&trkid=222336) with less chaos.

42147,"To be honest, the open-endedness of the two movies is what appeals to me the most."
42148,Timecrimes is very good. A real puzzler.
42149,"[Following](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Following/60000574?locale=en-US) feels very similar to Memento at times, though it is very low budget.  It is one of Christopher Nolan's first films, and it has some of the same themes and ideas as Memento, and possibly even Inception.

But yeah, since you like Nolan's other films, I'd definitely check it out!"

42154,"[Donnie Darko] (http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Donnie_Darko/60022315?trkid=2361637) - It's difficult to tell if this fits exactly what you are looking for, but I loved both Inception and Momento, and Donnie Darko is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It is the story of a high schooler who is plagued by strange visions that interrupt his rather quiet life.  Very open to interpretation, I ended up doing quite a bit of outside research to try to figure out more about this story. 

Fight Club [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) - Definitely an excellent movie similar to the ones you've mentioned.  If you haven't seen this yet you should, I won't say much more to avoid giving anything away but it is a great movie.

Both these movies are pretty famous, but they were what first came to mind when I read the OP's description, if you haven't seen these I HIGHLY recommend them."

No for real, spoilers below.


I loved that scene because around that point in the movie, I began to think ""oh great, that's the big twist, we'll find out he's a robot, too.""

He believed there was an invisible satellite orbiting earth that was an alien intelligence, but also god?  And that he was living two lives.  Philip K. Dick, a scifi writer in the 1970s as well as Thomas, a devout Christian living in the first century AD.  And he thought the FBI had broken into his house to look for illegal activity but later decided he had broken into his own home.  Dude was nuts, but an awesome storyteller.  Every time I read a Dick novel, I put it down after I finish it and just kinda think ""What.  The.  Fuck.  Did I just read?  And did I like it?  Fuck, did I even understand what the fuck happened?""

42214,"For a frame of reference, it's like if every M Night Shyamalan movie told you it's twist in the opening credits."
42215,"The theatrical cut actually is a bigger mind fuck, because for like 40 minutes after they just tell you what happens in the opening scene you are like ""what the fuck kind of red herring is that"" and then it turns out, no, they weren't joking, that is exactly what happens, which sends you down a meta-mindfuck of why the people behind the film would ever go in that direction artistically."
42216,"Pro-tip. If you don't know what version you're watching, start the movie and wait for the voice over. If there *is* a voiceover, immediately pause the film, mute it, and play it muted until you see Kiefer Sutherland. Then unmute and enjoy."
42217,Can you explain why without spoiling anything?
42218,"Oh, easily. Imagine you're watching Star Wars, and in the opening of A New Hope, a voiceover says ""Luke, the son of Darth Vader, sets out with his secret sister Leia to become a jedi and thwart the empire"". 

That's what the voiceover does. It flat-out spells out the major twists in the movie, and explicitly, not like *hint-hint* sorta thing. It's mind-boggling why it made it in, and threw me off when I first saw it, since I didn't expect the twist to be something they explained in the first lines of the film. 

I highly recommend Googling it after you've seen the movie."

It came out in 06, Adaptation came out in 02, so it's completely possible that Thr3e actually stole their plot from a joke in Adaptation.  It's fucking awful, by the way.  It was the first release from Fox Faith, which was Fox's Christian division.

Also Synechdote, also written (and directed) by Kaufman. Really, really more mind-warping than anything else here, though ultimately it may be a little *too* weird (just saying). Seriously, though, put your phone down when watching either of these movies - - they require attention."
42248,"When you go in knowing a movie is a mindfuck movie, you spend the whole time looking for the turn. With that said, you won't see the turn coming, I promise."
42249,It's a pretty classic story in the Greek tradition.  Vengeance and hubris lead to destruction.
42250,"No, this is as crippling a movie as humanly imaginable"
42252,"I've seen the ""highlights"" of A Serbian Film and yeah.... I wouldn't recommend it, pretty sure i watched 2 girls 1 cup as a palate cleanser."
42253,The Prestige is fucking brilliant.
42254,"Already saw it along with Memento!
I guess every Nolan's film is great!"
42255,Well I'm out of suggestions haha.
42256,Go see his first film *Following*. It's on Netflix.
42257,"Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind.

Also, The Fall. Really thought provoking."
42258,"Seconding both of these recs. The Fall is so insanely beautiful with such a great story behind it, and ESoaSM is just... it draws you in with so much intensity and just forces you to feel all these different, crushing emotions. Also a beautiful film as well."
42259,"> Is Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless mind a time travel movie?

No. 

It's a really good movie though. I was skeptical going in because of Jim Carrey and it not being a comedy movie but he did an excellent job."
42260,It's a real shame how heavily typecast he was. He's a great actor.
42261,Upvote for The Fall because it is just so stunningly gorgeous.
42262,The Machinist
42263,Christian Bale is so thin in this it looks dangerous
42264,I read somewhere that he survived on a couple apples and a tin of tuna daily to get down to that weight. He has such an insane dedication to his craft.
42265,Losing and gaining weight for roles is why Tom Hanks is diabetic
42266,The type of movie that makes you saying wtf until that one moment where everything makes sense
42267,Fallen with Denzel and John Goodman.
42268,"Tiiiiiiime is on my side, yes it is! Hey pal."
42270,Se7en if by any chance you haven't seen it.
42271,Sesevenen!
42272,"That sounds sort of like some Finnish hockey player. 

""Marko Sesevenen scores, it's 3-2 for Finland!"""
42273,Arlington Road.
42274,Great movie and excellent cast. Joan Cusack's performance was especially memorable.
42275,First Total Recall
42276,Pretty much 50% of Kevin Spacey movies
42277,Horrible Bosses?
42278,"No, that's in the other 50%. Horrible Bosses 2 however..."
42279,"The mindfuck when you discover Kevin spacey's character is not a horrible boss, he just has horrible employees \#blewmymind"
42280,KPax is one of my favorites
42281,"I'm late, but [The Others](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/). The ending left me completely mind fucked."
42282,Moon. 2009 British film.
42283,Fun fact: It's directed by David Bowie's son.
42284,Fun Fact #2: Sam Rockwell is the man
42285,Fun fact #3: The moon is actually real.
42286,"Fun Fact #4: it's not actually made of cheese. It is made of Cheese Analogue, and was placed there in the 40s as a marketing ploy by Kraft."
42287,"If it were made of spare ribs, would you eat it? I know I would!"
42288,It's a simple question Norm.
42289,"Heck, I'd have seconds and then polish it off with a tall, cool Budweiser!"
42290,And wash it down with an ice cold budweiser
42292,"Get out of here, David Bowie's son is Directing Warcraft?"
42293,"Not only that, but Source Code is an incredibly underrated film. And it's also done by the same director. Now, I don't technically considered time traveling sense the main characters are still proceeding forward in time and it's more like them reimagining his consciousness before the explosion on the train, but regardless, it's a great film."
42294,"Gone girl leaves you with a weird feeling a the end. Definitely worth the watch, though."
42295,Great movie.  Not so great first date movie as I found out.....
42296,The Wolf of Wall Street isn't either. Tho that was probably poor planning on my part.
42297,"I raise you The Green Inferno. She didn't know what it was, I wasn't into her, cannibal movies are awesome."
42298,"Cannibal, got it."
42299,"i read the book first and loved it but holy shit, the film was brilliant. I dont really like Ben Affleck in much but he was made for the part. So frustrating and nerve racking to watch."
42300,"Am I totally missing something? There seems to be so much hate surrounding Ben Affleck but I can honestly say there's never been a point where I've disliked him. Personal preference, I guess, but the dude is a solid actor."
42301,"People hate him because of the post-*Good Will Hunting* and pre-*The Town* era. He made absolute shit films like *Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, Paycheck,* and of course, *Gigli* and *Daredevil* in that timeframe. Mind you bad writing/directing account for two of those, but people hate the vessel that brings disease."
42302,He was the bomb in Phantoms yo!
42303,"Word up, Phantoms like a mothafucker"
42304,"I walked into the theater not knowing ANYTHING about this beyond that it seemed to be modeled directly from that weird married couple that was on CNN a few years ago. That said, my date fell asleep (craft beer hit her hard), and I was basically sitting on the edge of my seat saying ""what...the...fuck"" over and over again."
42305,I've never wanted to kill a movie character until I saw this. I was seriously pissed after the ending. Great flick.
72009,The Usual Suspects
42307,Cube
42308,I came here to say this.  One of the strangest premises for a film I've ever seen.  I couldn't help but be distracted throughout the film though by that one guy's resemblance to The Rock.
42309,A Beautiful Mind. Some of Russell Crowe's best acting in my opinion.
42310,"This what I was going to suggest too.  It's a lovely film but fills me with both great sadness and happiness.  Not a massive 'mindfuck', but until you understand the film you're not sure what is real and what isn't.

I think I need to watch it again, it's been a while."
42311,As long as people keep in mind that it is in no way how real schizophrenia works. It's an artistic interpretation of the symptoms because there's no way to actually make them look good on film.
42312,Lucky number slevin
42313,Ever heard of the Kansas City Shuffle?
42314,Shit fuck jesus is right.
42315,I'm gonna say what any man with two penises would say when his tailor asks him if he dresses to the right or to the left...yes.
42316,"What the hell happened to Josh Hartnett?

He was really entertaining in this movie and kinda fell off the radar"
42317,He is in the tv show Penny Dreadful
42318,Why do they call him the Rabi?
42319,Because he is a rabi.
42320,Orders. Orders is *orders*
42321,"Tell it to the one-legged man, so he can bump it off down the road."
42322,"My favorite quote... if you watch the outtakes, the actor made it up and everyone else was like wtf because it makes no sense."
42323,But my nose is already broken...
42324,There was a time...
42325,"The man from earth.

Cloud atlas isn't technically time travel I think."
42326,Upvote for Man From Earth. Get's you thinking about religion in a different light!
42327,"I agree with Cloud Atlas.  After a certain point, my brother and I paused the movie every ten minutes or so to discuss what was going on.  Trying to keep track of how everything was connected felt like solving a puzzle.  It was a blast."
42328,Pans Labyrinth
42461,Vanilla Sky
42330,"What, no Cronenberg? 

eXistenz is way, way up there. Jude Law plays a bodyguard to a woman who has designed an Inception-tier virtual reality video game. Waaaay too cool. 

Videodrome is less of a ""whoa it was Earth all along"" kind of mindfuck, but the Ex Machina kind of slow burn as the film's philosophy start falling into place. 

The Fly, obviously, but it's only a mindfuck if the only other movie you've seen with Jeff Goldblum starts with the phrase ""Jurassic Park."""
42331,"Came to recommend eXistenz, thanks for doing the good work.  Side note, it's on Netflix now!"
42332,K-pax
42333,"Rear Window (1954) and North by Northwest (1959) are both excellent.  I know they are ancient by modern standards, but give them a try if you haven't seen them."
42334,"Rear Window is great! I love how much that movie makes you feel like you're right there with Jimmy Stewart and the others in his apartment, wondering what's going on."
42335,Or any Hitchcock film for that matter. I'd recommend Vertigo as well.
57912,Pi
42338,"Personally, I have never been more mind fucked in anything I have ever watched until I saw Black Mirror. Its a show though. Pretty much every episode is good, but I suggest watching episode two or three first."
42339,"Hard Candy. Definitely one of those ones where it'll leave you saying ""What the fuck"" at the end."
42340,City of Lost Children [(trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5kr2EN-Q1w)  A lost gem that deserves more love or at least a bigger cult status.
42341,You must then also throw Delicatessen and Amelié onto the list. All wonderful.
42398,Fight club
42343,I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about....sir.
42344,"Watching the movie the second time is a whole different experience.  Little hints get dropped here and there, which one overlooks the first time.  And the whole Marla business takes a very different cast..."
42345,Poor Marla. That woman had a big heart.
42346,Rule Nr. 1 & 2
42347,This conversation is *over*.
42348,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". I assume everyone and their insane mothers have watched ""Psycho"""
42349,"[Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQk2NpfQm7k) will leave you scouring the internet to figure it out.

And, technically there is no time travel in [Timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BzYpF24LpY) although they can see into the future.

**EDIT**: Fixed second link."
42350,"Mr. Nobody is really good. You might see the end coming, but it really got me and I enjoyed it a lot."
42351,That movie confused me so much.
42352,"Session 9

It's about a team of hazmat workers cleaning up asbestos from an abandoned mental hospital filled with relics and paperwork and.... recordings. It's not a mindfuck as much as a psychic infection."
42353,Mulholland Dr.
42354,Frailty with Bill Paxton is another good one.
42355,Blue Velvet.
42356,"Prisoners  

martyrs (original French version not the shitty remake)

The Game

Silence of the Lambs

Fracture

The Cell

Crimson Peak

Requiem for a Dream

Hard Candy

Irreversible (highly recommended!)

Secret Window

Haute Tension (High Tension or Switchblade Romance)

Funny Games

I love these sort of films..."
42357,"Prisoners was phenomenal. I LOVE those movies which completely haunt you for days, as this one did me. Paul dano and huge jacked man were amazing. 

Check out Enemy. Same director, also starring gyllenhaal, equally mindfucking but with a more cryptic message"
42358,"> Paul dano and huge jacked man were amazing.

Sounds like a porno."
42359,"I loved Prisoners, favourite movie of 2013"
42360,2001 a space oddessy
42361,"The Mist. (2007)

Not so much a twist but definitely an ending you won't forget!"
42362,I HATE THIS ENDING.  I read the book and was destroyed after the movie.  I guess that was the plan.
