44881,"Sorry, what does ""disassociate"" mean in this context?"
44882,"I meant dissociate (the difference is largely grammatical) For me as someone with ADHD that percentage of time in the shower is the only time I don't have to herd my thoughts like cats. I have a hard time turning off my brain unless I am in the shower. I let my brain run rampant to process all my anxiety and then I sort of ""wake up"" and am better at being a person after that."
44883,bought a hair catcher for my bathtub drain for 5 bucks. May be the best thing I ever bought on Amazon.
44884,A weighted blanket - my sleep life will never be the same
44885,"I just wish there was one that stayed cool all night, I sleep hotter than the fucking sun and can barely tolerate a throw blanket."
44886,I also would be happy to read any good recommendations for ones that don't turn you into basically an oven at night.
44887,I've got a bamboo one that's not too hot.
44888,With bamboo filling? Or outside lining?
44889,Bamboo cover and small glass beads as the fillings.
44890,Bamboo is used to make the cloth itself. Incredibly soft. Get some bamboo socks. Now those are fricken life changing.
44891,Yes! Now it‚Äôs summer I‚Äôm struggling as the weighted blanket helps me sleep so much better but I wake up absolutely roasting at some point in the night.
44892,I got one because of the hype and hated that thing. I think mine was too heavy. I felt exhausted after i woke up.
44893,Weighted blankets are great for people who like to cuddle or snuggle up to something when they sleep.
44894,A good quality backpack. I got a north face backpack when I was a freshman in high school and I have it to this day 10ish years later!
44895,Electric kettle
44896,"Whenever this question comes up on reddit i am reminded that electric kettles (jugs) are not part of the basic ""moving into your own place"" checklist for americans.

I dont think i know any australians who don't have at the very least a $10 jug from kmart."
44897,"Yeah, cracks me up everytime. Who the fuck doesn't have a kettle."
44898,Here in America I have never seen a kettle in real life.
44899,37 years old and never knew an electric kettle is not an every day item.
44900,Condoms.  Your life will change if you DON'T use them!
44901,No kidding
44902,Only if you are having sex.
44903,True . It won‚Äôt be $100 anymore but your soul and your paycheck.
44905,"They make portable carts that can go up stairs, too.  I bought one called a Climb Cart."
44906,Electric toothbrush. You‚Äôre teeth and gums will thank you forever!
44907,Can confirm. Was gifted an electric toothbrush and have been teeth ever since. Gums still send me holiday cards.
44908,"Dope. Funny enough an Amazon package of two electric toothbrushes ended up on my doorstep and no one ever ordered them. Addressed to my address but not my name. I read that it's a scam to get confirmed orders and possible reviews or whatever but regardless, I love my free toothbrush. Also in that package were hair curler things that stylists use when doing perms. It was a pretty random but cool surprise."
44909,">and have been teeth ever since.

Is this how dentures are made?"
44910,Do you brush your teeth with LSD?
44911,Had to read this twice but glad I did.
44912,I was going to say a water pick as well
44913,A rice cooker.  Sounds silly but it really did change my life.  I've never made such perfect rice before.
44914,"A muscle massager gun that athletes use. I was a crippled Amazon delivery driver. Desperate for something that would help me become less sore. I swear by this thing.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up, but, I‚Äôm happy I could help everyone here! This is the one I bought [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0888LQBDR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for anyone who is wondering.

Edit 2: Sorry everyone, I was working. I‚Äôll reply to everyone ASAP!

Edit 3: There are so many different ones that work just as well as the one I bought. Look into the attachments and reviews by people, on Amazon. It is super helpful! 

Another user here pointed out AliExpress for the Muscle Massage Gun. I‚Äôll have to find that comment again, but, please thank that user here! Please thank u/colourouu for the AliExpress comment! 

Edit 4: Thank you for the wholesome award! Wow! This is amazing!"
44915,Mmm very cool. I see ads for these a lot online. What parts of your body ended up being most sore and benefitted most from it?
44916,"Definitely my legs, back, and shoulders were the most beneficial. But I have used it on my back, and arms too. They sell all kinds of attachment tips for different areas to target."
44917,"How do you target your back? My chiro has one of these and he uses it every time I throw something out and have to go see him; it makes a world of difference.

I've seen these on Amazon and just never grabbed one cause I'm not sure how I can actually hit the trigger points on my back without becoming double jointed"
44918,can you recommend one?
44919,"I got mine from Burlington coat factory for $50 and it‚Äôs incredible. I type a lot for work so my arms go numb constantly, this has been a game changer for me"
44920,"Hey, I was having that thing with my arms and it turned out to be a nerve bulging out from a disc in my neck. I went to PT, learned some posture and stretching/strengthening stuff and I‚Äôm well on the road to recovery. 

Not saying that‚Äôs what you have, but if it is then leaving it will cause permanent damage."
44921,"If you haven't already, be sure to check out ergonomic keyboards. They provided me with a huge amount of relief it was almost instant. I really like the Microsoft sculpt keyboard and mouse."
44922,My wife loves those too. But sometimes I hear her moaning and panting when she uses it. Is she doing it wrong?
44923,"Nah, you are doing it wrong if you aren't doing it that way. Try some different spots till you get it."
44924,Smart bulbs. Put one in a lamp in your bedroom and have it slowly brighten in the morning. It will change your life.
44925,Wut. Dude... my light game is improving today. First the flashlight guy and now this.
44926,Knife- It can change a life
44927,"Co-sign. You don‚Äôt need to be weird about it like us knife guys are, but if you go to Amazon right now and get a little folding knife- a $10 Opinel for example, somewhere in the #4-#6 range- you‚Äôre going to find way more uses for it than you think and it‚Äôll make your life way easier.

Or jump in to the world of modern folding knives and buy a Spyderco Delica for $85. If it doesn‚Äôt make your life better I‚Äôll buy it off you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
44928,"Happy knife, happy life."
44929,10 foot charging cable
44930,"A *good* flashlight. The tl;dr here is that you need one more than you think, it‚Äôs one of the most useful things you can own, and maglites and plastic crap are not even close in capability to what you can get these days.

Many of you have probably seen the feds recommending owning a dedicated flashlight- not the one in your phone. Which is absolutely good advice, because in the event you need a flashlight to see there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre in a situation where you are not going to be able to charge your phone, and will have better uses for your phone battery.

And a lot of you are probably thinking ‚Äúyeah no worries I have that plastic flashlight laying around here somewhere‚Äù or ‚Äúoh yeah my dad‚Äôs old maglite is in the garage.‚Äù  Guys, I love to break it to you, but the flashlight you have is probably terrible compared to proper modern flashlights.  

And no, I don‚Äôt mean the ones you get in the sporting goods section of WalMart- although some of those are reasonably okay, they‚Äôre almost universally overpriced for what they are. And I sure don‚Äôt mean this US MILITARY HIGH POWER EXTREME BEST FLASHLIGHT IN THE WORLD marketing traps you see on TV ads and kickstarters.

Nowadays you can get incredible flashlights that will light up your house better than your actual overhead lights, turn nighttime off in a 50 yard radius of you outside, or even fire a beam of light across a field or lake a mile away.  For less than $100 bucks. Hell, in many cases, less than $50.

Now obviously I recommend heading over to r/flashlight if you want to do some research- although fair warning, you might catch the flashlight collecting bug and there‚Äôs no coming back from that. But if you want my personal recommendation for some to check out-

The Sofirn SP36 is about the size of a soda can, and can put out about 100 times as much light as the flashlight on your phone in a big floody way that fills up rooms easily. Hovers around $60 on Amazon.

The Astrolux FT03: this is about as typical looking a flashlight as you can imagine, but the standard model can put out about 50 times as much light as your phone and will blast it out over 800 meters. About $35 if you‚Äôre willing to sit around and wait for it to come from China in a couple weeks.

The Lumentop EDC18 is a pocket sized flashlight about the size of your thumb that can do over 50 times as much light as your phone. If you don‚Äôt want a fancy user interface, go for the EDC18L. $50, or as little as $30 with a coupon on Amazon.

Anything from Olight, Sofirn, Convoy, Emisar, Noctigon, Nitecore, Wowtac, Thrunite, Surefire, Fenix, or Zebralight is going to blow your mind if you‚Äôve not used a real modern flashlight before and will be probably be more than enough for a normal non flashlight fetishist. There are plenty of other companies I‚Äôve forgotten to put in there I‚Äôm sure but I‚Äôll personally vouch for all of those.

EDIT: okay phew I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to‚Ä¶ do what it did, but thanks everyone for making me feel less like a weird flashlight pervert, or at least feel good about it. Especially thanks for the rewards, that‚Äôs pretty neat. I think I‚Äôve responded to everyone who responded so I‚Äôm gonna snuff out the Emisar D4V2 gently flickering in candle mode beside me and hit the hay."
44931,"On a similar note, a headlamp would be my recommendation for this thread. Great for when you dont have a free hand. I use mine all the time. Going up into the attic? Headlamp. Checking the breaker box at night? Headlamp. Digging out a tough splinter and need a bright light? Headlamp."
44932,I agree! My headlamp made it possible to clip my babies nails while she was sleeping (a near impossible task during the day).
44933,This guy flashlights
44934,"I swear I didn‚Äôt mean to write a novel, it just fell out of my fingers once I started typing."
44935,I want to find a woman that looks at me the way this guy looks at flashlights.
44936,Just make sure she‚Äôs looking at the right end or she might be blinded.
44937,"Thanks for this post. Based on your comment I'm now going to buy one and if it lights up a room just half as much as your enthusiasm and passion for the subject, I'll be happy with it. Thank you."
44938,"Aw, geez. You gave me an emotion there, how dare you. Thanks! In the words of Galadriel, ‚ÄúMay it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.‚Äù"
44939,PASSION IN THIS POST! üî¶
44940,"Oh man... I used to collect flashlights when I was a kid. Then I went about 15 years without really bothering with anything. 

Then I found out that stuff hadn't stopped getting better. It really is life changing."
44941,Dude what have you done to me I‚Äôm obsessed with these now
44942,"You just solved my ""OMG father's day is next week"" panic attack."
44943,FATHERS DAY IS NEXT WEEK FUCK
44944,"Good quality socks. 

Bedside reading lamp. 

Solar powered external phone battery. 

Emergency supply kit -- can be as simple as a MANUAL can opener and canned food, a few 2 liter soda bottles of water, and a crank flashlight/radio.

(Added:. Note that emergency canned food isn't something you buy and put on a shelf -- it's something you regularly eat that you buy a little *more* of, the new stuff goes in the back of the shelf and you eat the older stuff.  Canned tuna, canned beans, canned soup, things you can eat without cooking if the power goes out. )"
44945,I wear darn tough hikers every day. $20 a pair but worth it. They're thick wool blend but not hot. On laundry day when I wear cheap synthetic socks my feet STINK
44947,Which one do you recommend?
44948,"I bought my wife a Wacor Mewatec. We're very happy with it, German technology.

I bought myself a Chinese one, Hibbent non-electric and installed an inline thermostat: https://www.hibbent.com/collections/bidet-seat"
44949,"An electric blanket. 

I genuinely felt like I could cry when I first got into a toasty heated bed. My apartment was so brutally cold in the winter and I didn‚Äôt have the money at that point to keep my central heating on all night. For the record, electric blankets aren‚Äôt expensive to run, and most have timers too."
44950,Had a friend growing up that had an electric blanket. Called it Mr. Heaty and it was the best thing ever whenever I slept over.
44951,MR HEATY!! That's cute as fuck
44952,"Kind of terrified of heated blankets after hearing horror stories from my uncle about fires from those things back in the day. However, last Christmas I discovered the pure joy of putting a hot water bottle under the covers at the foot of the bed while getting ready for bed. Climb in and your feet are instantly toasty warm. Even found this company that makes these super long ones that almost fit across my whole Queen bed. Life changer in a tiny Irish house with gas heating."
44953,"I /really/ like electric blankets. It's so much more efficient than heating your whole room up.

I like just keep it spread out on the bed, lay on top of it, and put another blanket over me. It's super comfy this way, I think. Heat rises up through you and gets trapped by the other blanket.

No power grid connection at my house, and in the winter if we run out of propane, an electric blanket is a life saver since it lets you sleep comfortably even if the house is cold, in exchange for very little electricity, which the solar power system easily supplies even in winter."
44954,"A heated mattress pad is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I think it was a little more than a hundo so didn't fit here, but a warm bed is the best thing ever."
44955,"I can't have a electric blanket anymore. I toss and turn a lot and about 15 or so years ago, when one was on my bed it started smoking and burning because it got twisted when I tossed and turned. So no I won't get a electric blanket ever again. That's okay though because I have a cat who likes to snuggle under the blankets with me and we keep each other warm."
44956,"In Australia, electric blankets are usually the ones that go on your mattress like a mattress protector. Have you tried one of those? Electric throw blankets are also a thing and they're too easy to confuse by name, especially now I have both!"
44957,Is there a 'cooling' version of this? I could really use a more power/cost efficient way to manage to stay cold as I am trying to sleep (especially the pillow).
44958,"just stick your leg from under the blanket.

and pray that the monster that lives under your bed doesn't grab you."
44959,"Came here expecting to spend < $100 on a life changing item, now in credit card debt from all the great recommendations. Life change accomplished."
44960,"I just ordered a pair of tuft & needle pillows and am looking at high-powered flashlights for my dad‚Ä¶ this thread is super helpful, but kinda expensive.

Edit: Ooh! A foot massager!"
44961,Handheld vacuum cleaner
44962,"A home network DNS.

In short, this blocks nearly all ads on every device on my home internet connection. It also blocks tracking. This goes well beyond what an adblocker on your computer browser can do - I no longer see ads in apps on my phone or on my Fire TV. It's a night and day difference.

I set mine up using Home Assistant running on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. For anyone tech savvy, it really isn't difficult to configure. Additionally, since I did this via Home Assistant, I then also have the overwhelmingly best platform for home automation already set up. If you have a smart home and are currently using the automations built into a voice assistant, SmartThings, or anything else, it's shocking how much of an upgrade this is in your ability to automate your home - I have it set to do things that I never would have even imagined were possible before I started using it.

There are many ways to set up a home network DNS. Home Assistant just made the most sense for my use-case.

Edit: Specifically, I use AdGuard Home"

44964,"https://youtu.be/KBXTnrD_Zs4 imo, this has easier setup for someone who is inexperienced!"
44965,"High quality cookware sets. You‚Äôre looking to spend around $80-$100 on this. Your food will cook better and it won‚Äôt stick so you end up saving time on washing dishes. 

Humidifier/dehumidifier - these are simple, cheap and overlooked small appliances that almost everyone will end up benefiting from. You can buy them for as cheap as $30. 

Light strips -Hear me out on how this is life changing. There are certain colors of light that can affect our mood and level of awake/alertness. 

Spending $20-$50 on some light strips can give you some extra control over your sleep schedule and/or the setting of your personal space.

Edit: embarrassingly managed to use you‚Äôre instead your."
44966,"I always bought cheap cookware until I won 3, $100 skillets in a raffle. I love those things. They're literally the best. I never knew how much my cheap ones sucked."
44967,"You can't get a full cookware set of any quality for only $100. 

Individual items like a cast iron or carbon steel pan, sure. But a set of anything will be more than $100."
44968,Right? That comment confused the fuck out of me since the *cheap* cookware sets i find are easily 60-100. I'd be expecting 200 probably
44969,"A long charging cable, 
I saw prettymuch the exact same comment on a similar thread and thought I‚Äôd try it out - life changing lol"
44970,Bidet attachment for your toilet
44971,I read Biden-attachment and was like wtf is that
44972,"It scares you off the toilet by saying ""Listen, Jack, I'm not taking any guff from you today."""
44973,"Come on man, poop."
44974,A second monitor for your computer. It saves so much time and makes work easier.
44975,A fire extinguisher
44976,A tens unit.  When I was a kid I had both of my shoulders partially dislocated. They've always ached and hurt since then. As I got older the pain got worse.  Especially if I've done anything during the day that utilized my shoulder.  A friend brought over a tens unit for me to borrow. I loved It so much that I bought my own. I used it daily for 3 months working my way up to the highest level. The pain went away and never came back.
44977,"What is that, can you comment a link to a website for it?"
44978,"Foot massager. No joke, these things make you realize why certain parts of your feet or lower back hurt after a long day at work. I started using one a few weeks ago and it's helped my posture and my ability to stay on my feet for long durations by leaps and bounds."
44979,"I bought some screwdriver head keychains. A flat head, philips, and a hex. Now I never don‚Äôt have a screwdriver."
44980,A water pick. An absolute gamechanger.
44981,You can marry the love of your life for $100 in the state of Texas. I don‚Äôt know how it helps but it‚Äôs great to have someone.
44982,"not an item but a turtle. i have had mine since he was a baby and he will look at me when i say his name, hand feed, and when i play with him he will walk to me. him and my other one both do this. there names are hulk and thor, hulk is a yellow bellied slider and thor is a Cumberland slider

&#x200B;

edit: thanks for the upvotes this really blew up  

btw ik its a weird question but does anybody that upvoted live in or near daytona"
44983,"Oh man I love turtles so much. There's one at a pet store near me and he's so social, always follows you when you walk next to his tank. I feel sorry for him he needs some company

What's the silliest thing either of your turtles have done?"
44984,"buy him, please"
44985,I can't man I have too much responsibility  on my plate already :(
44987,"For me, it was a wireless power bank (phone charger). 

Story time: A whole bunch of us got our flight canceled in Amsterdam. I was literally second to last in line so we had to wait like six hours to get served. I made friends with the people around me and everyone had their phones dying. And we didn't have enough European plugs, as well, there aren't any plugs in the line to charge us up. Some had iPhones, some had Samsung, we all had different ports. People wanted to call their family back home to update or use their email. So I pulled out my power bank and got 5 people to have their phones topped up to like 15%, enough to get them through the final stretch of our ordeal until we got to our hotel.

I also had a situation where my phone usb port stopped working and just used my power bank everywhere. 

I bought it for $30 CDN online."
44988,"Yeah, and buy a BIG one. I carry a 20000mAh when I travel - that thing can keep me going for days."
44989,My brother always carries a mini power strip when he travels. If he needs to charge he just asks anyone that is already charging to let him use the outlet. Then multiple people can use it.
44990,Squatty Potty
44991,"My wife and I just got a cheap foldable step stool to sit on when we give our son a bath, doubles as a whatever you'd call the generic version of a squatty potty."
44992,"The SP is, although a great intro to the concept , a bit gimmicky. I showed my ex husband them and he was like ‚Äúwtfffff that cost damn near $100 (am in NZ), hold my beer‚Äù and went to the garage and put together 3 pieces of nice wood‚Ä¶ voila, a squatty potty."
44993,I made one as a Christmas gift for my husband Few years back. He loves it. We call it the Stool Stool.
44994,"if reddit has taught me anything, a bidet attachment for your toilet"
44995,"This is boring but a fire kit! Blanket, gloves, ladder and extinguisher."
44996,"A really high quality electric toothbrush. 

&#x200B;

Save yourself agony and maxing out your credit cards on dentist bills."
44997,But even a good toothbrush is not a replacement for a dentist visit. It's still a good idea to go once per year
44998,Getting your foot sized properly and a pair of good shoes. You wont notice it when youre young but you will when youre older.  Knees and back will thank you.
44999,The diva cup. Absolutely life changing for anyone with a period! I am not kidding.
45000,"Ugh. I love the concept, and I‚Äôve tried them and similar cups but I must have a weird vagina because I don‚Äôt get good results and i only have a couple more years of periods to go so I‚Äôve sort of given up. Quarantine took all the pressure off."
45001,"I never had good results with the divacup or similar style. After pregnancy they caused so much pain... but there is other styles, menstrual disc instead of cup, that work better for me. If you Google Softcup that style worked great for me. There's a fancier brand, Nixit, that I love but since it's $50 maybe try out one of the similar styles first to see if it even works for you? The nixit one is a very comfortable texture, holds its seal and didn't cause me any pain. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying out cups. I was really relieved when I found it since for some reason after my second kid any other style cup would cause me agonizing pain no matter the stiffness of the cup, and I hated having to go back to pads and tampons."
45002,Ruby cup for me but YES. It's been 5 years now and we're going strong. I don't dread my period like I used to. I love never worrying about whether I'll have to make a run to the store for more period products. And I LOVE sleeping in without having to set alarms to take a tampon out to prevent TSS.
45003,"It looks like it would be so much cleaner, but I can‚Äôt even put a tampon in without feeling extreme discomfort :(

edit: thank you everyone for the nice replies, i ended up falling asleep shortly after i wrote this comment"
45004,"See a pelvic floor physiotherapist!!! Pelvic floors can actually be too tight (which is not often talked about) it can be due to past traumas, anxiety, or just our bodies being a holes. Physio can help significantly"
45005,Period panties are the best! I used to love a DivaCup but after having an IUD (since removed) I can't use it without pain (for reasons I don't understand). But period panties are the absolute best.
45006,"I actually didn‚Äôt know those existed, I might have to try it out!"
45007,"There are lots of smaller, local brands around as well as bigger ones like Thinx. I have pairs from both Aisle and Revol. Revol are much cuter, but both are super comfy and so much better than pads, tampons, or cups."
45008,I‚Äôm a Knix fan! Their customer service is top notch.
45009,"My wife uses an IUD and a diva cup.

I'm so sorry that you ladies have such a hard time with the internal plumbing. My limited male experience has taught me that none of you are the same and all the advice is bad."
45010,I like the lily cup much better. I can‚Äôt use tampons either but the lily cup is comfy.
45011,"Beat me to it! This was my first thought; menstrual cups are such a period upgrade. Nothing disposable to run out of, and you can empty it as needed, wearing  it for up to 12 hours at a time, which is great for lighter days. 

I also just feel cleaner when using the cup. Absorbent solutions (tampons and pads etc) are great, but it‚Äôs nice to not have to deal with dryness or pads bunching. Period days involve the cup, and period underwear for backups/overnight/heavy days, and nothing else. No stress!"
45012,"I bought an electric lunchbox on ebay for $30AUD. I love it. You can cook basically anything you could cook in a pot on the stove but its got stacking layers for different things. Very compact.

I usually make rice & curry for my lunch but it's also great for omelettes, boiled eggs, porridge, soups, ive seen people even do cakes & puddings. It's really handy at work, best little gadget ever."
45013,"The amazon kindle has changed my life. It allows me to read in the complete darkness of my bed and is lighter in weight than any mass market paperback and certainly thinner. The current models all feature a dimmable backlight. Combined with the e-ink display that is easy for the eyes makes it possible for me to read LOTR right now with our baby sleeping in her crib in the same room while the lights are off. They can also be purchased for around $50 for a certified refurbished or $90 for a brand new one. I also recommend the kindle unlimited subscription that has thousands of books included if you read alot of books each month, it's $10 a month (and a new kindle comes with 3 months free)."
45014,"A couple dumbbells. You don‚Äôt need much equipment to work out, so a couple 20 pound dumbbells is enough to gain muscle and get looking good. Also I got a book called ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health big book of exercises‚Äù for somewhere around $20 and it taught me so much about building muscle and it made me realize everything I was doing wrong when working out. The book was pretty life changing for me as well"
45016,"I don‚Äôt know if anybody here has said this, but a back scratcher!"
45017,80$ worth of DMT would certainly change the ever loving shit out of your life

45033,"Anker battery pack.

The thickness of a slim wallet, profile of a credit card, and if I forget to charge it 5 times, it still has juice left."
45034,I had mine for a year but now the USB port is kind of finicky. Kind of disappointed. Went to buy another one but didn't see Anker. Got one for about $40 but it's plastic and can only charge my phone maybe twice before running out of juice. Need to order a new Anker online. Those things are tanks (well minus the USB port potentially breaking I guess).
45035,Welp thanks for making me impulse buy a portable charger at 2:00am guys
45036,"It's great if you're out and about. Hell, I've even used mine at home because my phone was low and there wasn't a wall plug close enough to charge my phone from where I was sitting. I swear I'm not being paid to say this lmao."
45037,"I recently bought a case for my phone that is also a battery. It makes my phone thicker and heavier, but the battery adds 150 percent battery life. I've been saying for years that you could double the size of my phone if I could have a bigger battery, and more I have it and it is exactly as awesome as I imagined it to be"
45038,My electric blanket. Nothing better in the winter than to get into a bed already toasty warm.
45039,"My grandmother would give all the grandkids an electric blanket once they started middle school / Jr high.  Her logic was you weren't going to piss in the bed anymore and electrocute yourself.  I don't think that was really a risk but you weren't going to change her mind. 

I did love my electric blanket in the winter though..."

45047,"Cuddling is great until you want to actually sleep, then I just push away."
45048,"But...damn, her hands cupping your D cup man boobs...how awesome is that?"
45049,"First of all, they're C cups, and it makes me feel awkward."
45050,What is this partner you speak of??
45051,Use your $100 to buy one.
45052,I wonder if Black Friday will bring about some deals...
45053,I‚Äôm always on sale during the holidays bby.
45054,You're assuming OP can date out of his/her league.
45055,I like assumptions
45058,RetroPie. That is all.
45059,What kind of basic tasks do you do with it?
45061,cut a hole in the floor and...
45062,Stick your dick in it?
45063,"""Nice chandelier, Todd."""
45064,"Now I'm picturing walking into an apartment room and seeing a random dick sticking out of the ceiling, Id be the guy grabbing a stick and poking while laughing like a kid."
45065,"Okay, but can you switch? We need a second healer."
45066,I got one of those air couches last week for $30 down from $100. All my friends judged my purchase but it's so fucking comfortable and portable. Oh camping and wanna sit down? Not on my couch.
45067,Can you tell me which one?
45068,"I never heard of an air couch until two hours ago when the inflatable hot tub I bought on Craigslist came with a wrinkled flyer in the instruction manual for one.

And now I'm wondering what the hell is going on with the universe. This can't be a coincidence. Am I real? Is this part of the simulation?"
45069,My hitachi magic wand.
45071,"They make an attachment for dick use.

Just an FYI."
45073,So you like handling the stick?
45074,It is a mildly unpleasant spasm that weirdly gets you off
45075,"> one of my girlfriends

Good thing you didn't buy it for all of 'em then."
45077,Where did you get it for under $100?
45078,Cheap Casio wrist watch that I had for my entire middle/highschool. Helped me get an appreciation for watches and other fine crafts later in life.
45079,I also have a cheap $50 Casio watch that I had for 9 years before it broke. Loved it so much that I bought the same model again last year to replace it. Do you know what model yours is (it says on the back)?
45080,my parents bought me a cheap casio watch for my birthday a few years back. it sits in my jewellery box & i don‚Äôt wear it anymore (i‚Äôm not really keen on the pink band) and i hear the alarm go off at 7:30 every morning. it‚Äôs been about 9 years... i don‚Äôt think the batteries are ever going to die.
45081,Sliced bread. I can staple that stuff to trees.
45082,r/breadstapledtotrees
45083,.....why was I surprised this is a thing?
45084,Because you are only 4 months old.
45085,"I have no idea why the hell this exists, and frankly I don't think I care. It's too beautiful."
45086,I found it on r/all a few times and it confused me so much that I subbed. Never fails to crack me up
45087,Don't forget about /r/treesstapledtobread
45088,Why am I not surprised
45089,sure it's reddit anything can happen...but really? this out of all the possible things to exist?
45090,"So you're the one who's been putting bread on my trees ey?

*rolls up sleeves*"
45091,"This dopey bastard right here. http://imgur.com/Ehu5Gqn Given to us for free by some dude on the side of the road because he didn't wanna take him to the shelter. Best doggo ever in the world. 

Edit: Found his Christmas pic from a couple years ago. Thought it might be enjoyable to you lovely weirdos.  http://imgur.com/a3ikZVd"
45092,That's some top tier /r/toofers action right there
45093,A good cast iron pan. Literally nothing more versatile or helpful in the kitchen. Imo.
45094,"You can get 3 of em for under 100, most of the time. We started off with one that is now named Bessie and it has a name because it's literally our most used, most loved pan even over the Allclad...and it now has a ton of friends, including pizza ""stones"" and bread pans and dutch ovens and griddles and stuff. We went cast iron crazy. And I love it."
45095,A vintage Parker 51. It's a fountain pen from the 1940s that still writes as if it were fresh out of the factory. I love it because it hearkens back to a time when products designed to last forever. It's an interesting piece of history that will probably last me for the rest of my life.
45096,"I'd love to buy some really cool pens and stuff, but I'm afraid I'll lose them too easily"
45097,"If you treat the pen more like a phone than a pen, you won't ever lose it. As someone who writes a ton(student), I still find a lot of use out of a pen."
45098,"So throw it in my pocket when not in use, take it out to play with in the bathroom, and plug it in at night. Got it!"
45099,"Treat yourself! Buy some just for at-home use. I have a couple really nice pens that live in my desk, I use them exclusively at home. It's a pleasure to do work with super nice pens and incentivizes me to actually sit at my desk and use them :)"
45100,I love all-metal pens. There aren't many things as satisfying as just moving around something reasonably hefty in one hand.
45101,"TSA Pre-Check. $85 for 5 years. I have a new job where I travel about once per month.  Now I can keep my shoes on, light jacket, belt, watch ... And I don't need to take liquids out of my bag.

So fast to set up. Did an online application, and was able to schedule an appointment for a Saturday two weeks later. The appointment is called an interview, but there were no questions. It was for providing fingerprints, and showing ID. Was done in under 15 minutes, and had my Known Traveller Number by Tuesday evening.

For $11 more you can get Global Entry, but I don't travel internationally, so it wasn't a big deal."
45102,"Wow, this is a thing? How fucking ridiculous is that? Yeah, we're gonna ask you to remove everything and submit to a damn hassle in case you're a terrorist. Unless you pay us not to. What the actual fuck.

Edit: guys, I get it by now. Background checks."
45103,"The TSA is purely an illusion of safety. The chance that they would stop an intelligent terrorist is extremely small.

I'm all for paying a small fee to speed up the process!"
45104,"Oh, I get that it's all security theater. I just think it's ridiculous that you can *circumvent* that security theater for a fee.

Makes the whole security theater more of an extortion scheme. ""Hey, for a small fee we have a solution for this problem we created ourselves."" Only difference is instead of trashing your shop and breaking your leg they trash your bags and fondle your balls."
45105,"It creates a sense of ""pride and accomplishment"" for those passing through security."
45106,I have global entry for international flights as well.   Only 15$ more.   Def worth it for 5 years IMO.
45107,"It's important to note to all who read this **APPLY FOR GLOBAL ENTRY INSTEAD!** the global entry system includes the TSA Pre-check, is just a few dollars more ($100) and the money goes to the customs department **NOT TO THE TSA!** 

Do not support the TSA with Pre-Check, support an arm that actually does some good by getting Global Entry instead!"
45108,"This is so worth is. When I travel internationally and get back into the states at 11pm, the last thing I want to do it wait with 200 others in customs. Anything that gives a shorter line."
45109,My guitar
45110,"If your guitar is under $100 and it is actually good please tell me your magic secret

EDIT: alright I get it there are many magic secrets to cheap guitars lmao"
45111,Buy used.
45112,"If you like the look and the sound, a guitar tech can make it play good. A general setup for a guitar isn‚Äôt that expensive and makes a world of difference."
45113,"Bought a '92 Squire Stratocaster for $99 a few months ago. It's sounds great and feels great too, better than some of my other $1000 + guitars. Just goes to show the expensive ‚â† better, and each instrument should be judged unprejudiced and unbiased."
45114,"Squier is one of those uncredited treasures, especially that era. That‚Äôs a great find."
45115,"My hammock.

I spent so many spring days and summer mornings curled up outside in it, reading a book, and just reveling in the outdoors. (It helps that I have a view to a state park from my yard, but I digress).

I still try to sit out there now with a healthy amount of blankets, but it looks like the ""hammock season"" is officially coming to an end :-( Still hands down my favorite purchase of 2017 though."
45116,I live on the 28th floor but have a good sized balcony so I have my hammock up out there most days and even tho it is too cold now 80% of the year you can find me out there after work reading or smoking and watching the city!
45117,It sounds like you need an underquilt my dude https://www.rei.com/product/882626/eno-ember-2-hammock-underquilt
45118,"Any DIYers or penny pinchers seeing this, you can make your own or use a regular blanket etc too. There are probably advantages to the name brand option, but for cheapskates like me, not $100 of advantages."
45119,"Whipped cream dispenser and some no2 cartridges.

For just $40, I can infuse anything. Sparkling green tea ramen? Done. Fluffy chocolate? Done. Tea infused bourbon? Hell yeah.

Also, it's fun to breath laughing gas."

45122,"Kitchen knife. Just under $100, but it‚Äôs a wonder to cut with."
45123,What kind? I‚Äôm thinking about getting one.
45124,"Not OP, but the Victorinox Fibrox is under $50 and is a fantastic starter knife"
45125,Just bought one bade off of the Reddit hype. It does live up to the hype. Cheap and excellent.
45126,I‚Äôll name a few 1) silk pillowcase 2) humidifier 3) a suction cup to go over the overfill drain in the tub. It gives me a few extra inches of bliss to soak in.
45127,i got my cat for free :)
45128,did you steal it?
45129,My Kindle! Plus my $0 library card. I read aaaalllll the things üòçüìö
45130,Having a Kindle is awesome when traveling. No more heavy books in my carry-on luggage!
45131,"My mechanical keyboard, I've got Cherry MX Browns."
45132,Can you explain what's so great about a mechanical keyboard
45133,"Most keyboards you use do not have actual, real switches inside each key but one large electrical pad that each key hits when pressed.

When every key has its own physical, real switch, it is much easier to feel what you are typing. This leads to less errors, less cramped hands, and overall just being more satisfying to type on if you type a lot.

You can also choose what switches you get -- clicky/non-clicky, tactile/non-tactile, more force/less force, etc."
45134,"Ironically, I started making more mistakes when I got a mechanical.
Plus, I hate how loud they are. Oddly, I prefer the crisp, shallow membrane (?) keys on my Surface.

But maybe I'm just not fantastic at computering."
45136,Reds with o rings or nothing
45137,Do you still use it? You could add some *O*-rings to dampen the sound.
45138,"I love computers, build them, play with them and help troubleshoot them. I abhor mechanical keyboards."

45143,"EEC-IV OBD 1 scanner here, it's pretty great"
45144,"My adderall prescription. 

Best $26 I spend in a month."
45145,Adderal is life. Makes thinking like the normal people possible.
45146,"Everyone I've met that is prescribed adderall are way more productive than ""normal people"""
45147,"I mean, ADHD is basically the brain being wired to think a different way. When people with ADHD are given medication to correct the way their brain's are wired, they basically get to put all the energy they used to keep focused into actually thinking."
45148,"I'm ADD, took Adderall for 3 years & was bored out of my mind. I got slightly better grades, but lost my spontaneous thinking, didn't feel like myself, & every day began to feel the same. Personally, I feel much better off of it."
45149,"Its not just about ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù

Its more of finding means to articulate yourself. Without Adderall I feel like the connection between my brain to my mouth doesn‚Äôt exist and I can‚Äôt speak what is on my mind, or even form coherent sentences."
45150,"JESUS THIS^^^^^  just got prescribed about a week ago, and its changing my freaking life.."
45151,"Arguably a PED for some people. 

I don't personally have an issue with it, but I've seen it help and hurt people. One person became a full blown addict. On the other hand, several people have functioning lives because of it. 

The distribution of outcomes always seems to be on one of two extremes, mostly good, but really bad for some. I guess that goes for a lot of pharmaceuticals."
45152,Oh I'm not one of those I still hardly get anything done when I'm medicated. I just don't space out in class as much anymore.
45153,My dog was $100 and my cat was $0 so I would definitely say those are
45154,Mine too and I agree!
45155,"I bought a Snuggie a few weeks ago. I was marching in a Halloween parade and we needed costumes, but it was gonna be like 20 degrees so they said to dress warm, so I just bought a Snuggie and pinned an ""As seen on TV"" sign to me. It's okay. It's as warm as a normal blanket, but stays on very nicely. The main downside is it's nearly impossible to walk in since it's incredibly long and feels like it's about to fall off. Overall, 6/10."
45156,Bought one as a gag gift.  It did not stay as a gag gift.
45158,"My stainless steel vacuum sealed 40oz water bottle. Keeps ice cold water freezing no matter how hot it is, even over night! Bought it for $22 on amazon and definitely one of my best purchases! 

Edit: Spelling."
45159,I bought one of those knock off Yeti cups from Walmart.  It works amazingly.  It's kept ice frozen in my cup for a full 24 hours.
45160,"I bought my husband one for fathers day (and my in laws one, i bought my father in law the massive 60 something ounce one for trips) my husband left it at work over a weekend and it still had ice in it monday morning. He borderline prays to that stupid cup. I think i have been replaced."

45187,"This. I have some shure se215s, they're far from being the best headphones in the world, but they kick the shit out of crappy apple earbuds and the like. Music is so much more enjoyable with them."
45188,"Today I found one of those lights that miners use to see that they put on their heads. It wasnt a helmet and light, just the light, but I can definitely see using that light to fix problems with a car much easily"
45189,Love my headlamp. The red light mode is helpful too if you don't want to blind people
45190,"Spyderco Endura 4, $70. $90 with the lanyard my boss made me. Haven't done much but clean and occasionally hone it since I got it and it's still sharp as shit. Would HIGHLY advise"

45195,"The theracane. It's a hooked stick thing you can use to massage your own back. $30 on Amazon.

My neighbor bought one, and I went over to borrow it multiple times a day until I bought my own. It might not seem so important if you're not a manual laborer, but damn. It changed my life.

Nobody paid me to say this, it's just a damn good product."

I splurged a couple of years ago and bought Creative Gigaworks T40 series II speakers on boxing day. Newer ones have bluetooth, but I can unplug my laptop and plug a phone into the aux cord.

The sound quality is unheard of. Its got so much punch, and I love how it doesnt have one of those massive subwoofer boxes. Highly recommend."
