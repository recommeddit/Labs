25285,Their all Spidermen in my book. Their all the best for portraying such an amazing character so well.
25286,"The MCU doesn't deserve Tom Holland, he's putting all of his heart and effort for the character but all of it goes to waste with the shittiest scripts of any Spider-Man movie, so, I think I'll go with Tobey in this one"
25287,"Holland's Spider-Man doesn't really feel like Spider-Man to me. He feels like an entirely different character. Not necessarily a bad thing because the MCU is vastly different to the main universe, but he just doesn't feel like Spider-Man to me."
25288,Yuri lowenthal is the only right choice.
25289,Nice choice!
25290,Sorry I don’t dig the whole “Parker is a Stark dickrider” spiel with Tom. Tobey’s still my favorite and always will be.
25291,very frank opinion
25292,Tobey for me always. Not just for nostalgia but because his felt the most human. Spider-Man 2 did the best job at showing this and it did a great job of showing why he’s such a relatable character with his own struggles like all of us. Tom is well on his way to being a great character on his own without all the Iron Man tech and tying Tobey for my favorite live action version of Spidey.
25293,Damn everyone are such marvel sell-outs! I mean the dream spiderman beat out Tobey by a mile!
25294,"As a proud raimimemer, Tobey all the way.

Why? Cheesy, Superhero nostalgia.

Superhero movies are mostly way too serious now than the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy ever was. And that's fine when the story requires it, but a superhero movie is basically us suspending disbelief in order to enjoy this two hour feature, so no one would really mind if some things were over the top.

It's why Shazam is good too. I really enjoyed it."
25296,"Andrew Garfield was the most accurate live action Spider-Man. He had the looks of 616 Peter, a long with the wit and personality to play both Peter and Spider-Man. Its a shame he got dealt such a shitty hand. Cause I would've loved to see him trade quips with Downey's Stark and the rest of the MCU

Tobey was awkward and too soft spoken, leaving for some really jarring scenes. And he certainly was never convincing as Spider-Man at all.

Tom kinda feels like he's channeling both Tobey's and Andrew's versions together sometimes. But I hate how they characterize him as Stark's sidekick. And his Spider-Man comes off as incompetent. He isn't really funny either. Its more like funny stuff happens to him or around him. Again going back to his Spidey being incompetent. I also don't see Peter Parker when I look at him."
25297,"Garfield could have been the perfect one. He is the definitive casting for Peter Parker, he got the looks, the attitude, everything right. But he was stuck in a bad movie.

Tom is great, and he has the advantage over Andrew of actually having a good script to work with.

Loved Toby as a child, i think he was good for the time, but the lack of quips and his overall dummy attitude (which is not supposed to last 3 movies after he gains the powers, he should be confident by Spider-Man 2), makes me think he is the worst Peter Parker ever put in screen. Not that he was bad, he was great for the movie he was in, but as a adaptation of the Spidey i know from the comics? Didn't came close. (Even though his stories were pretty much comic accurate.)"
25298,"Best: Garfield was the most accurate ultimate/616 Peter in live-action.

Worse: Holland, Don't see Peter Parker just see miles Morales"
25299,"Tobey’s my favorite Spidey for the fact that raimi got his motivation right, this one being “great power, great responsibility”. Garfield’s motivation was revenge and Tom’s spidey wants to prove himself to the Avengers, he does show some of responsibility in Homecoming and I really liked that line in Civil War “when you can do the things that I can...”.  but I feel they need to show more of that and less of “ look at me, Mr. Stark!”.

Don’t get me wrong,  every Spider-man movie version has been great in their own right, but I feel that the original trilogy just resonates more with me."
25300,I'll start the Tobey Maguire fan lines. I prefer his first two movies.
25301,Josh Keaton
25302,i see youre a man of culture as well
25303,Maquire was a great Peter Parker and a bad Spider-Man. Garfield was the opposite. Holland is great at both.
25304,Tobey wasn’t even a bad Spider-Man. He was a good Spider-Man. It’s just cause he doesn’t quip as much in comparison to the other two.
25305,"I think the quips are a big part of the modern Spider-Man. However, Tobey was my introduction to my favorite hero so he does hold a special place in my heart."
25306,Hmm kinda agree with that. Now that I think about it.
25307,"Peter Parker: Tom Holland

Spider-man: Tom Holland

Love Interest: Emma Stone, but I think Zendaya has the potential to take the crown. 

Aunt May: Marissa Tomei

Best Friend: Ned

Flash: ASM

Uncle Ben: Raimi

Story: SM2, but I find ASM to be the one I rewatch most. 

Overall, I like the MCU casting the most but find the plot of Homecoming a little underwhelming compared to SM2 and ASM."
25308,Holland. Just on look and how he plays the character feels like peter Parker
25310,tom
25311,"As a fellow member of r/raimimemes, it’s Tobey.


Nostalgia, campiness, the memefest of quotes and scenes, I love all 3 of the movies."
25312,"Tom Holland, but that might also be because I'm a 2000's kid"
25313,Same here for both.
25314,I was born in the 80's and I agree with this sentiment as well.
25315,"Tobey was a good Peter Parker

Garfield was a good Spider-Man

Holland, so far, is the best of both"
25387,"Imagine, I can remember it (I grew up in England btw)"
25388,Was true for over a decade. Also technically 5 not 6.
25389,And motherfucking Gilly didn't even try to be decent about it. Imagine the shame when the no. 7 batsman whacks you consistently at 80 SR
25390,"Australia by a mile. Bradman is a cheat code himself, and with Gilchrist providing an extra boost at the wicketkeeper batsman I don't see any other team coming close. 

For the all rounder spot, I would pick Keith Miller (bat avg 37, bowling avg 23), or Steve Waugh(over 10k test runs at 50+ average) if you want to make the strongest batting lineup. Waugh can do the 5th bowler job easily when you have 4 great frontline bowlers. If you want to go with 5 proper bowlers, choose Keith."
25391,"I'm not sure that Australian batting line up can play well in India! Barring Hayden, others sound struggle I think. Even Hayden also had only that one dream tour in 2001 while he didn't perform extraordinarily on other tours to India.
And yeah, Smith to some extent."
25392,"Yeah. Bradman basically is that trump card which works everywhere. You can make the crappiest of batting line ups and put Bradman there and suddenly that team can probably beat any other team in the world. 

&#x200B;"
25393,Did Bradman play in India? I Genuinely dont know.
25394,"He didn't. India toured Aus and his avg in that series was over 150. This is an article which discusses what avg he might have had in India if he had toured.

&#x200B;

[https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/how-much-would-don-bradman-have-averaged-had-he-played-in-india-594805](https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/how-much-would-don-bradman-have-averaged-had-he-played-in-india-594805)

&#x200B;

In my opinion, he would have killed in India too. He was just that good. You can't have an average that's almost double of any other great player of every era without actually being that good. A century can be a fluke; an average of 100 isn't."
25395,What about if we took out Bradman and replaced him with Hussey or Clarke or Border
25396,All average 50 or near and are class fielders. Still not many people could top them on their day.
25397,"Greg Chappell's next in. I'd probably play him ahead of Smith tbh, he's Ponting-tier."
25398,"Ooh, let's do other teams not mentioned in the comments.

SL - Jayasuriya, Atapattu, Sangakkara (WK), Jayawardene, de Silva, Ranatunga (c), Tillakaratne

NZ - Turner, Sutcliffe, Williamson, Crowe (c), Taylor, McCullum, Hadlee

Zim - Campbell, G Flower, Houghton (c), A Flower (WK), Goodwin, Johnson, B Taylor

SA - B Richards, G Smith (c), Amla, G. Pollock, Kallis, AB de Villiers (WK), Procter

BD - Habibul Bashar, Tamim, Mominul, Shakib, Mushfiqur (WK), Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain"
25399,"If it's ODIs, my all-time NZ XI would be:

Guptill, Turner, Williamson, Crowe (c), Taylor , Cairns (not sure if I can say his name), McCullum, Vettori, Hadlee, Bond, Boult 


this just my opinion tho"
25400,Fleming has to be there in the NZ lineup somewhere. He's the only guy from NZ to have scored more than 7000 runs in the tests.
25401,"No Ashraful or Islam in Bd! No naagins for you!!

No UT in Lanka? Let me inform the Lanka stats team."
25402,"These are Test teams, man. C'mon, what kind of madman wants Tharanga in any Test team?"
25403,Or even ODI teams That fucker tharanga's pujara esque 2(18) at the godamn wc is still a eyesore...not to mention all the times this guy sapped the momentum's of jayasuriya and dilshan innings
25404,how dare you? Let me get that UT brigade to cook up some choice stats and theories to prove that he is the 'bestest' ever opening bat for Lanka in years.
25405,Why pick a match fixer?
25406,"Ashraful? Because I did not consider the fall from grace but only ability. With more sense, he would not have done those things and be an ATG for Bd by now. Such a waste."
25407,"India has 3 in the 10k club, WI have 2, but Australia has Bradman. 

Hard to tell really!"
25409,But Rohit doesn't even have a double against Zimbabwe.
25410,"But does that matter when saying ""Rohit is celebrated because of his double centuries against Zimbabwe"" sounds super funny and smart in my head?"
25411,And he is garbage regardless.
25412,lolwut
25413,Imagine dismissing Ponting and Bradman only to have Steve Smith walk in
25414,Finally dismiss Smith and Gilly walks in.
25415,Dismiss Gilly and Gillespie walks in
25416,Dismiss Gillespie and McG...nah
25417,Imagine a bowler's plight who has to bowl to Ponting and Smith.
25418,Australia's allrounder would be [Keith Miller](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6612.html)
25419,"Your WI line up is underwhelming. WI had some absolute legends like George Headley and three Ws

Greenidge
Conrad Hunte
George Headley
Viv Richards
Brian Lara
Garry Sobers

And we are not even including Worrell, Walcott, Weeks, Haynes, Fredericks, Chanderpaul"
25420,"Australia easily:

1. Hayden
2. Lawry
3. Bradman
4. Ponting
5. G. Chappell
6. Smith
7. Gilchrist"
25421,"Come play in India with this team, I'm sure you'll change your mind."
25422,"this isn't about a one off match in one venue though, think about these lineups playing in 5 grounds - MCG, Lords, Wankhede, Centurion and SCG (personal favourite) which batting line up would perform the best across those 5?"
25423,I would go for Eden Gardens instead of Wankhede.
25424,"> Come play in India with this team, I'm sure you'll change your mind.

Oh wow!"
25425,"WestIndies : Greenidge, Haynes, Richards, Lara, Sobers, Walcott and Weeks

Australia : Hayden, Warner, Bradman, Ponting, Border, Waugh and Gilchrist 

India : Gavaskar, Sehwag, Dravid, Sachin, Kohli 

England : Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond Barrington, May, Compton, Botham

Australia has Don Bradman but the WestIndies and England teams looks more legendary IMO."
25426,"England is going to have a very good line-up as well.

1. Hobbs
2. Hutton
3. Hammond
4. D. Compton
5. Barrington
6. Botham
7. If you're looking for a batting keeper, then maybe Prior or someone, but Knott is the better player"
25427,Batting keeper would be alec stewart by a country mile
25428,"triple ton by name alone, who can compete?"
25429,"Compton a bit of an odd-one out there. Can we put WG in instead? Partly for the memes, but a Test average of 32 for his day is ridiculous."
25430,Why is Compton the odd one out? Nearly 6000 runs at above 50 puts him right among the very best batsmen to have played for England.
25431,"Yeah, you’re right in retrospect. Also just looked up WG and his Test record isn’t actually as impressive as I thought. Still, beats Compton on the beard front."
25432,"If beards were all it took, India would win every game they play, though Moeen and Amla would singlehandedly keep their teams in it."
25433,Grace's average was actually exceptional for his era. Batting was incredibly tough in the 19th century.
25434,"That's what I thought as well, but actually, he's quite far down [the list](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=batting_average;spanmax1=31+Dec+1900;spanmin1=01+Jan+1801;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting) of Test averages in the nineteenth century, even if you ignore the people that only played a couple of matches. He's twelfth of the people that played more than ten.  Special shoutout to KS Ranjitsinhji (ENG), who averaged 53.88 from 12 games."
25435,"South Africa’s would be better than WI and Ind imo. 

Richards, Smith, Amla, Kallis, Pollock, AB, Procter/Faulkner"
25436,I still think Tendulkar and Kohli (or Richards and Lara) are the best two batsman in this hypothetical. Dravid and Gavaskar would also make the SA team maybe.
25437,Definitely. Gavaskar over Smith and Dravid over Amla
25438,Same with Bradman and Smith
25439,"I think Australia would be the best.

1. Bradman

2. Hayden

3. Ponting

4. Border

5. S Waugh

6. Clarke

7. Gilchrist"
25440,Bradman alone will basically make any Australian team over powered.
25441,Be be interesting to try and make the analysis a bit more qualitative by summing peak batter ratings for each player. Not a perfect number but would be interesting.
25442,Baggy Green: We have a ~~Hulk~~ Bradman
25443,Australia 2015 WC lineup deserves a mention along with ENGLAND 2018. Both teams bat deep with the tail enders capable of hitting atleast one six.
25444,Thought we were talking about test XIs? Neither of these teams can face a moving / seaming / spinning ball.
25445,If thats the case then I apologise for posting irrevelant comment.
25446,"Based on what exactly? Also, what were the bowlers those two teams faced bowling? Some other form of bowling like mooning?"
25447,"What do you mean based on what.

2015 Aus team got mauled by Eng incl that infamous 60 which was preceded by a less embarrassing 136, not to mention losing 0-2 to Pak in the UAE before the WC.

This Eng team has shown enough cracks on visits abroad and at home as well. No need to elaborate that any further.

The rest of your post makes little sense.

&#x200B;"
25448,They have the quantity but not necessarily the quality of a 00s Aus lineup or the '11 Ind lineup
25449,"In modern cricket, batting line ups go all the way to 9 or 10. Why are people stopping at 6. IMO, Pak would give anyone a run for their money with Imran, , WK, Razzaq, Afridi, Wasim coming in at 6,7,8,9. 10 Maybe Waqar or Saqlain round out the 11.  That would give you 

1. Hanif Mohammad 
2. Saeed Anwar 
3. Younis Khan
4. Javed Miandad 
5. Inzamam 
6. Imran Khan 
7. Kamran Akmal 
8. Abdur Razzaq 
9. Shahid Afridi 
10. Wasim Akram 
11. Saqlain Mushtaq 

Admittedly, Australia has a better top 7, but batting 10 deeps gotta count for something."
25450,The idea being you pick 8-11 purely on bowling- that's why Razzaq or Afridi wouldn't be in an all time Pak side
25451,"Well, you’d pick the best side and Razzaq may or may not belong, early 2000’s Razzaq was an awesome bowler. Afridi on the other hand would certainly make it based on bowing alone."
25452,"Na you would have Wasim, Waqar, Qadir and Saqlain.

this is test remember"
25453,"If you completely ignored batting ability, you’d be right. I don’t rate Qadir or Mushy quite as high as others."
25454,"I mean in all time team you need to trust the top 7 to do their job. You shouldn't compromise on your bowling because you can't win unless you take 20 wickets.

also neither Razzaq nor Afridi had prolific test careers."
25455,"Sure, except Afridi has a significantly better bowling strike rate compared to
Qadir. In fact his strike rate is second only to Ajmal amongst major Pakistani spinners. (66 vs. 65). That slight difference is massively offset by a batting average of 36. 

Razzaq on the other hand, you’re probably right about. Underwhelming career with a few great match winning innings. 

As for trusting the top 7, in modern cricket many Test wins have been anchored by the lower order. 
Pakistan on the verge of a historic test loss to Zimbabwe, and Wasim and Saqlain come together and put on 412 runs. Many other examples like that. Look at the countless examples of England wins due to substantial scores by their 8,9,10 bats. I do think batting should matter in all time teams."
25456,Mongolia's by a country mile
25458,"While they're also great (it is a lineup of all-time greats), I think these 3 countries are undoubtedly better."
25459,"Australia - Hands down

1. Hayden
2. Langer
3. Ponting
4. G. Chappell
5. Steve Waugh
6. Border
7. Gilchrist

That’s just the modern era. No Bradman"
25460,"while this isn't true in anyone on here's lifetime, england historically have a lot of batsman who average 56-60 over 40+ tests. not sure if it's enough to beat bradman + the five best other australian batters though. bradman is basically two world class batsman in one."
25461,India easily.
25463,"Bradman is a weird one. 

He played at a time when cricket was not as serious as it has been for the past few decades. Moreover,  cricket was mostly played in either Eng or Aus so players didn't have to adapt much. They also faced the same bowlers season after season. Speaking of bowlers, were there any bowlers then who would be considered world class today?

He was a great batsman no doubt. The best of his times. How he would have done against the great WI bowling attack or the Australian attack of early 2000's or against the spin wizards of the subcontinent? It's difficult to say. It is also unfair to the modern batsmen because the challenges they face today are different."
25464,"> Bradman is a weird one.

There is one clear thing in common with every cricket fan I see questioning Bradman's legacy. 

I'm not sure why you guys over there have such a bee in your bonnet about Bradman."
25465,I'm of the opinion that comparing cricketers across eras is stupid.
25467,"Other than Hayden and Smith, all the other Aussie bats are average to shit against spin. Our guys perform anywhere.

Peak Tendulkar, peak Gavaskar, peak Dravid, peak Kohli and peak Sehwag is a motherfucker of a batting line up and you'll be lucky to get them 4 or 5 down."
25468,Imagine picking any team apart from Australia. Only a fool will do that.
25469,"Am I the only one who thinks that the Australian line up that everyone is mentioning here to be the best, doesn't have a good record in spinning subcontinental pitches! Especially in India.

It's a great batting line up no doubt, but serious credibility issues against spin in India. May not be the best all conditions line up at all."
25470,"> the Australian line up that everyone is mentioning here to be the best, doesn't have a good record in spinning subcontinental pitches! 

Test averages in Asia:

Chappell ...... 74

Hayden ........ 50

Smith .......... 48

S. Waugh ..... 42

Ponting ........ 42

Lawry .......... 39

Gilchrist ....... 37

Bradman ...... ----"
25471,"India : Gavaskar, Sehwag, Dravid, Kohli, Tendulkar, Laxman (imo India's greatest ever #6), Dhoni

Australia : Hayden, Langer, Bradman, Ponting, Smith, Clarke/Steve Waugh/Greg Chappell/Allan Border, Gilchrist I mean what in the fuck  

Sri Lanka : Jayasuriya, Atappattu, Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Mahanama(?)/De Silva, Peak Matthews(?) I'm not too sure of Lanka's best ever

England : Hobbs, Cook, Hammond, Pietersen, May, Bell, Botham

South Africa : Smith, Richards, Kallis, ABD, Amla, Pollock

WI : Greenidge, Haynes, Lara, Chanderpaul, Richards, Kallicharan/Lloyd, Sobers"
25472,"Aus cause of the Don, then WI and then India very close behind WI.

Warner and Haydos as an opening combo... brutal. Softens them up for the Don. Then fucking Ponting and Smith to follow. Then after that carnage in walks Gilly. Bowlers would cry. I'd definitely grab Keith Miller as the all rounder. He was talented at just about everything.

Reason I pick WI over India is because of Lara. He may not be as consistent as Tendulkar, but every once in a while he would just get in these moods and make absolutely mammoth scores. Biggest propensity for big scores I've ever seen in cricket. Was impossible to dismiss on his day. Also, there's a few batsman for WI who I am surprised were left out, Everton Weekes and Conrad Hunte should be in there too, I reckon.

India's side listed is pretty much who I would have picked. Sehwag would be an awesome foil for Sunny, I would really have liked to watch their different approaches while batting together."
25473,I think the reason I preferred Ind over WI is I trust the Ind opening pair slightly more (Sehwag is slightly better than Gayle and Gavaskar is more reliable than Greenidge and Dravid is a significantly better 3rd non-opening batsman than whoever the WI had - Chanderpaul or whoever else.
25475,"**Zaheer Abbas** over any of the listed batsmen

Also noteworthy, Mudassar Nazar"
25476,"Wait this lineup doesn't make much sense. Younis Khan obviously for Hafeez, Hanif Mohd for Yousuf (actual opener) and Miandad definitely stays but not as WK!! Wasim Bari should come in for ~~Malik~~ Malik^TheFixer.

Edit: Also, could I just LOL at you thinking you needed to justify picking *Imran* over Afridi? I mean sure, one's only *easily* the greatest cricketer Pakistan has ever produced, while the other played all of 20 odd Tests with a so so record, but yea, tough choice."
25477,Afridi/Imran should never be in the same sentence. Lol Hafeez?? Where's YK?
25478,[Similar ranking for ODIs](https://i.imgur.com/M7b6NaH.jpg). Minimum qualification is 80 matches. No surprises here too.
25479,"I’m shocked that of the 3 captains in history to win 100 ODIs, one of them is Border!"
25480,Australia's greatest captain.
25481,The one surprising fact is that Azharuddin's India had a better LOI win-loss ratio than Ganguly's India.
25482,"India had a very poor 2004,2005 untill ganguly was dropped as a captain."
25483,"What was the cut-off criteria? I don't see Virat Kohli here. According to this page, he has captained for 52 matches and has >70 win percentage."
25484,Looks like 80 matches.
25485,Yet Asghar Afghan is also in the list having captained in only 51 matches.
25486,"My bad. Yes, the cut off for this list is 80 matches. Not sure how Asgar made into the list, please ignore him."
25487,Thank you for pointing that out. Not sure how I missed it when it was right there in the comments.
25488,Honestly surprised Cronje has a better record in both formats than Smith despite the latter's far superior teams.
25489,"Cronje had an equally formidable team or may be an even better team than Smith with deadly Donald/Pollock combo and a whole bunch of all rounders in young Kallis/Klusener/Boje. They were batting down to 10 (Pat Symcox) during those days.

&#x200B;

Also The two dominant teams were Aus and SA with a big gap between rest. pak had formidable lineup with two W's but underperformed. Rest of the teams weren't quite there yet in overseas performance.

&#x200B;

By the time Smith took over India had risen (won 2 tests against Smith's SA in SA - one each in 2 series). India had second best overseas record next to Aus in that decade 2003 - 2011. They were on par with SA with Win/Loss ratio of 1.0

SL became better, Pak lost two W's but were still competitive, England stopped being shit since 2005 Ashes turnaround. So there were more competitive teams and the gap was not that big as in Cronje's era."
25490,You might not have watched much cricket in 90s.
25491,"True, was too young to even remember any matches even if I did watch"
25492,"South Africa's ODI team in the '90s was terrifying/awesome. An even scarier proposition than '90s Australia. I really think their legacy would have been very different if it weren't for those awful World Cup exits. I still remember, going into the '99 World Cup, they were massive favorites."
25493,That Steve Waugh led Australian team was a terror.
25494,Gavaskar's team drew 30 times out of 48 matches? A lot of those matches would have been snorefests
25495,"If you don't have the bowlers to take 20 wickets for you, you may as well lay a tent on the pitch for 2 days and camp in it by doing a blockathon (draw it). That was his formula and an applaudable feat in itself :)"
25496,"Sure looking back it's applaudable, feel a bit sorry for the viewers though"
25497,"naah. We had too much time on our hands those days as viewers. Much more relaxed lifestyle. Lol.
Test match used to be 5 days with a rest day in between after day 3.

3 days of play + a rest day + 2 days."
25498,"Winning percentages:

Waugh/Ponting ....... 66%

Lloyd/Richards ........ 51%"
25499,Almost like there was an era of difference.
25500,GC Smith played in total 117 matches.And was captain for 109 !! Born leader
25501,"Unfortunately tactically weak and not very good at winning. Strong resources but lower win loss ratio than all of the long term rsa captains of the last couple of decades.

He took a team that had lost 2 series and drawn 1 with all the rest being wins in 5 years and kept them around 6th place in the test rankings for a number of years."
25502,That's why there is a saying that any monkey could have captained the WI and AUS teams of that respective era and had same results.
25503,"I'm sure Cliver Llyod Has a full head of hair still to this day since he never had to pull even a strand of hair thinking which bowler should I throw the ball to now (Sylv clark/Andy Roberts/Holding/Garner/Marshal). Or who to bat where since the order pretty much dictated where each one batted by default.

Same goes for Steve Waugh and Ponting"
25504,"Kohli has the worst batting line up (himself excluded) of the last 4 Indian captains for his bowlers to be even more effective and enhance his already good record. 

Past Indian captains were a fast bowler short of what he has now (combination wise) but Kohli has 4 or 5 batsmen short of what they had at their disposal in terms of quality.

He is shat upon as worst captain in social media era ignorant generation, but record speaks that he is closer to these other legends even with this shit batting line up around him."
25505,"You cant win a game if your bowlers arent taking 20 wickets, doesnt matter how good your batsmen. Kohli currently has one of the best Indian bowling units of all time and currently the best batting line up in Asian conditions, really isnt that surprising to see him up there. 

I dont really think it would matter who was captaining this Indian team to be honest."
25506,"While agreeing that Bowlers win you matches batsman also need to set up matches for them to be able to win it. All I was saying is with a slightly better batting line Kohli would have had a better record than it is already now. 

I'm not saying that he needed the quality line up similar to Fab 4. A little bit better than what it is now would have helped him immensely to close out matches since he has the quality to do that better than any of the Fab 4 to close out matches when he gets a little bit of more support from other end..

&#x200B;"
25507,"> He is shat upon as worst captain in social media era ignorant generation, but record speaks that he is closer to these other legends even with this shit batting line up around him.

There's a reason that this list is called ""Greatest Test Teams of all time"" and not the Greatest Captains of all time.

Determining a captain's ability purely on the basis of the number of wins is foolish."
25508,"> He is shat upon as worst captain in social media era ignorant generation

Lets not blame the whole social media. Opinions expressed in r/cricket is far different from what is seen on other social media."
25509,At most 2 losses and at least 5 wins for Kohli in the next 13 matches to be up there with the greatest teams that have been there in the past.
25510,"It's almost impossible to come up with such a list. You'd really need to break it down into:

- Openers
- Bradman
- 4 through 6
- Gilchrist
- Bowlers

The only two nailed on positions would be Bradman at 3 and Gilchrist to keep. From there Kallis and Sobers must be in, and the obvious openers are Gavaskar and Hobbs, so you can name a Top 5 as:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Kallis
5. Sobers

With Gilchrist coming in at 7. This leaves the 6th position (though you could move Sobers to 6 with the other batsmen in 5). The problem here is that there are just so many options. Tendulkar, Ponting, Sangakkara, Lara, Richards, Dravid, and so on. I'd probably shorten the list to Tendulkar, Ponting and Sangakkara though, all 3 having a serious claim. 

- Tendulkar: Shear longevity and weight of centuries
- Ponting: At his peak he was only second to Bradman
- Sangakkara: Shear weight of runs

As this is an ""All time Test XI"", I'll take it to mean the best player for the job, not the one with the best longevity. In this regard I'd put it down to Ponting or Sangakkara. In terms of players at their very peak though, it would have to be Ponting. He may not have aged as gracefully as Tendulkar or Sangakkara, but this isn't about who was the best in their mid 30s, but rather who was the best at their peak, and Ponting edges that one. 

Depending on tastes you could order that list as you want, but I'd probably go with:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Ponting
5. Kallis
6. Sobers
7. Gilchrist

This leaves the bowling attack, which is probably the hardest to pick. Having Kallis and Sobers in the side certainly helps in that regard. Ultimately though there are so many different sets of players that people could pick here. Personally though I'd take Warne, Steyn, Marshall and McGrath. Steyn might stick out as an odd choice, but his numbers in an era for Batsmen speaks volumes. Ultimately though there will always be plenty of debate on any team given, but I'd give mine as:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Ponting
5. Kallis
6. Sobers
7. Gilchrist
8. Warne
9. Marshall
10. Steyn
11. McGrath"
25511,"Why McGrath tho? I've never understood why people put him in all Time xi. He's great but I think haddlee was about the same with the ball, but hadlee can bat so why pick McGrath over haddlee?"
25512,"If an attack can dismantle that batting order, then I don't think Haddlee would have much of a chance."
25513,"McGrath is arguably the best example of a true metronomic bowler. He could stick a ball on his line and length each and every time without fail. Hadlee and McGrath were not ""about the same"" with the ball in that regard at all, and if the measure of who I picked for that spot was to be based on batting ability, I'd have chosen Imran Khan, who is one of the three great all rounders, with Kallis and Sobers. 

My own final question on the side that I listed was Steyn or Khan, but considering the shear depth of batting in the top order, and the strike potential of Steyn, it ultimately came down to that to decide for me. But again, in terms of bowlers you could field around 5 attacks worth of players which all hold claim to be the considered for such positions."
25514,The great Tendulkar and Lara have both said that Mcgrath was the best fast bowler they faced.
25515,"I think VVS Laxman influenced Indian batting more than anyone else. Batting at No.6 with Sehwag, Dravid, Sachin and Ganguly ahead of him and averaging 45+. He won more Test matches for India with his 3rd, 4th innings masterclass than anyone else I can remember."
25516,"You are right. Impact wise he is number 1 then Sehwag and then Dravid. Although correct me If i am wrong, only Dravid can lay claim to single -handedly winning a game for india outside the subcontinent."

Marshall (WI)     
Fred Trueman (Eng)      
12th Man - Jonty Rhodes (Saf)      

The last fast bowling slot is incredibly hard to choose. Akram is a no brainer simply because he's the only left armer worthy of a spot and  he'd be picked even if he were a right arm bowler. Marshall is probably the greatest pace bowler of all time so that leaves that one spot. Fiery Fred had a great test record, the first player to ever take 300 test wickets and he did it with not only a brilliant average (21.57) but also a great strike rate of 49.4. Bowlers such as Ambrose, Garner, Lillee, McGrath etc had similarly great test stats but what puts Trueman ahead for me is his insane first class record:      
603 matches - 2304 wickets - 18.29 average - 43.2 strike rate      
Remarkable record and one which none of other candidates comes even close to (Ambrose is the highest wicket taker of the bowlers I mentioned with 941). Those numbers are better than even Marshall's with more wickets, a better average and better strike rate.      
I put Jonty as the 12th man obviously because he's the greatest fieldsman of all time and he isn't going to be doing anything else as 12th man."

25522,So Graeme Pollock doesn't make your top 24? A little harsh
25523,DAMN. That's who I was missing from SAF. Thanks. He definitely makes it. I'll replace Sutcliffe with him.
25524,I've always wondered what it would be like to see Sobers bowling to Sobers.
25525,"Sorry, it was supposed to be Kallis in the 2nd team. Fixed now. ANd replaced the Wickie."
25526,"Sangakara isnt good enough with gloves plus his average is so much higher as batsman only. Richards didn't play enough test cricket to be judged (though it wasn't his fault). All your other selections are really close and it comes down to personal preference. Though I do prefer Lillee over Ambrose as Lillee was consistent and would form a devastating and balanced attack with Akram (massive swing), Marshall (pace,strike bowler) Lillee ( consistent with pace)"
25528,"I knew his average was good, not that good!! He did bowl with arguably the best pace attack ever and that would've helped him. But there's about 10 pace bowlers who could make this team, of the top of my head. Hadlee, McGrath, Waqar Younis, Barnes, Steyn, Truemen"
25529,"Willis, Kapil Dev, Lance Gibbs, Thommo, Bond, Walsh, Holding, Roberts, Larwood, Miller....so many."
25530,"With both my teams, I figured that having this line-up, even a good enough WK who has a great average would more than work. But then you're right, if the bowlers are this good, you need excellent glovemen. Hmm."
25531,yay dravid <3
25532,"How in the fuck is Kallis not in your top 24 but AB is? I love AB to death, but come on man."
25533,"FUCK. Sorry, Kallis was supposed to be in the 2nd team. Sobers has been put in there twice due to an oversight."
25534,"As a fellow 1st XI vs the other 1st XI selector, I offer you these sides:

1st XI
1. Hobbs. 
2. Hutton.  
3. Bradman. 
4. Tendulkar. 
5. V Richards. 
6. Sobers. 
7. Gilchrist (wk).

4. Lara. 
5. G Pollock. 
6. Kallis. 
7. Imran. 
8. Knott (wk)
9. Warne.  
10. Akram.  
11. Lillee."
25535,"Pretty good XI. Can't really argue any of them aren't absolute greats. 

1) Hobbs - Agreed

2) Gavaskar - Maybe Hayden, but I can see why Gavaskar just pipped him

3) Bradman - If you disagree with this, you don't know cricket

4) Tendulkar - Agreed

5) Sanga - His average is just below 60 with over 12 000 runs. Can't dispute that

6) Sobers - Only rival would be Kallis

7) Gilchrist - Only rival would be if Sanga was WK. Boucher and a few others could challenge as keeper alone, but no one else for WK/batting combo

8) Akram - Here I would argue Imran Khan. Could also put Botham, Hadlee, Miller, Kapil Dev

9) Warne - Fair. Obvious rival is Murali

10) Marshall - Always going to be difficult because there's so many great seamers. He's one of the best.

11) Lillee - Same as above. Might argue McGrath, but I won't disagree with Dennis.


All in all good list, OP. Only major change is maybe put Sanga on gloves and then you could replace Gilly with another batsman, but the thing is you're going to be hard pressed to find a lower-middle batsman better than Gilly anyway. Maybe Allan Border, who I argue is underrated and just that tiny bit better than S. Waugh, Ponting, Clarke. 

Wally Hammond probably deserves a spot, too, but I couldn't find somewhere he could fit."
25536,I would argue Hadlee over both of them. Bowling wise theyre close (McGrath didn't have to carry the attack nearly as much). However Hadlee was a lot better batsman than both of them
25537,"> His average is just below 60 with over 12 000 runs. Can't dispute that

Well, there's the issue of the quality of opponents he's faced for the majority of his career"
25538,"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/50710.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting

40 against Aus and Eng, 47 vs SA, >50 against every other team.

Clearly better against some than others, but pretty impressive regardless."
25539,Thanks man. Though Sangkara had a an average roughly the same as Gilly's when he kept plus his batting is so much better when he's not keeping.
25540,"To be fair when you have guys like Hobbs, Bradman, Tendulkar, Sobers batting ahead you don't really need your keeper to be averaging 45+.  I think these greatest XI's of all time should feature the greatest keeper.  Not the greatest keeper/batsman combo.  It's why I'd have Healy in my side over Gilchrist."
25541,"but if my keeper can average 50+ at a s/r of 80+ in tests, then he can be as bad a catcher as Munaf Patel, I'd still rather have him."
25542,Why wouldn't you just select someone like Ponting then and hand him the gloves?
25543,because ponting cant strike at 80+ haha. My comment was more of a joke.
25544,"> 7) Gilchrist - Only rival would be if Sanga was WK. Boucher and a few others could challenge as keeper alone, but no one else for WK/batting combo

Not even AB de Villiers? Sure, he doesn't have as high a strike-rate as Gilchrist, but I'm sure he could bat that quickly if necessary."
25545,Kallis in instead of Tendulkar. Higher batting average and 280 wickets to his name.
25546,Sachin's average dropped considerably in his last 2 years. Before that he was averaging just around 57-58.
25547,"You could argue the same about Ponting, but his average peaked out around 60ish."
25548,"averaged 60 for a bit in 2006 

http://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerBatGraph.asp?PlayerID=2041"
25549,"Agreed. Then you have three genuine fast bowlers, as well as Sobers and Kallis. This is a bit of overkill so you can drop Akram for Muralitharan."
25550,"You can't drop Tendulkar. You just can't. I'm all for Kallis, hell, I'd have me in any team ever, but you have to drop someone other than Tendulkar. I'd drop Gavaskar and open with Sanga and slot in Kallis"
25551,"I've always thought Tendulkar was overrated. Great batsman, sure, but he was outperformed by batsmen such as Kallis in my opinion, despite batting on a lot of Indian roads. He was a more exciting player than Kallis, who was a wall, which is why I think people rate him more highly than they should."
25552,"Oh come on man, you can't make the ""he batted on roads"" argument. He made runs all around the world. If the ""batted on road"" argument had merit, you would rule out Sanga too because Sri Lankan pitches are possibly more batter friendlier than Indian ones.

Like I said, I think Kallis is probably a better player, but there is no way in hell can you can drop Tendulkar if you're making a test XI."
25553,I left out Sangakkara as well.
25554,"If you're going to seriously use that ""road"" argument, then you should eliminate the Australian and South African bowlers because they bowled on bowler friendly wickets. That argument can go both ways."
25555,"> I've always thought Tendulkar was overrated.

Best ODI batsman ever for me. However, in tests, I'd take Kallis. I'd still take Tendulkar tho and have to push out Sanga."
25556,I should have clarified that I meant in Test matches.
25557,id take tendulkar because of the difference in average against Australia.
25558,"> a wall

This is a legitimate factor. Cricket only exists because people watch it."
25559,"Imran Khan should be a cert in such a team. He's one of the top 10 bowlers of all time, a very useful lower order No.8, who averaged 38, and an inspirational leader. In the last 10 years of his career, Imran averaged 19 with the ball and 51 wit the bat. He's as close to a perfect all round cricketer as you can get. 

I love Wasim but have no idea why he gets picked over Imran, who was a better bowler and a far better batsman."
25560,"Pretty hard to leave out Sydney Barnes - http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/8996.html 

And yet everyone has?"
25561,"> http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/8996.html

I gave him considerable thought. He was a great player, but he played in an era when it was a bit easier for bowlers and wasn't able to play many tests, presumably just because they didn't play many back then. There were a few bowlers with ridiculously low averages back then. I went for Marshall and Garner instead because they performed exceptionally well and played many more tests in an era where it was more difficult for fast bowlers."
25562,"Yeah, I'd probably leave him due to lack of matches. Unbelievable record though - can't complain with an attack compromised of Garner and Marshall."
25563,"No Hammond? Come on now

6. Sobers

7. Gilchrist

Bowlers are pretty interchangeable with the great allrounders of the 80s plus the great quicks of the 70s, 80s and 90s. But my top order is set in stone"
25564,"As good a batsman as he was, who do you drop for him?? Though this is why these teams are so hard. Really only no debate selection is Bradman"
25565,"I wouldn't drop Hammond at all, but maybe Lara to fit Viv Richards in"
25566,Viv 'only' averaged 50 and some would argue that isn't good enough for an all time xi. Viv was only just edged out in my team by Sangakara who's averaging 58 career and something like 70 in 70 tests as a specialist batsman. That's just to good to ignore.
25567,"Fair enough, the reason I rate Richards over Sangakkara are the eras they played in. Richards dominated attacks like no other at a time when fast bowlers reigned supreme. No other batsman had the same aura as he did during his career.

Sangakkara is pure class, and a bit underrated imo, but even he doesn't have that same feeling of omnipotence that a Richards, Tendulkar or Lara innings did."

25574,No Kiwi's... so sad :/
25575,"Thought I'd pitch in with my two cents since most people seem to be listing the the best players in each ""role"" in a cricket team, rather than the best test team.

Bear in mind that players before the 1985ish are slightly underrepresented in my team simply because I've never had the chance to appraise them, other than the ones who force their way in on the merit of having a truly freaky set of stats.


1. Sehwag 
2. Sobers
3. Bradman
4. Tendulkar
5. Ponting (Captain)
6. Kallis
7. Sangakkara (WK)
8. Warne
9. Courtney Walsh
10. Muralitharan
11. Shane Bond

Couple of odd selections, but based on what I saw of him Bond was out and out the most destructive bowler I've ever seen bowl, he was hurt by a lot of external stuff in his career IMO. In this team with many bowlers I think it'd be easier to rotate him and not stress his body too much, and just let him focus on bowling lethal bursts.

Sehwag is also not in the top two openers ever for sure, I think. But for the best XI ever, in such a stacked lineup where the top 7 always average over 400 (I'm assuming there are no crazies dropping Don) I'm happy to gamble the 10-20 or so runs on average that he'd fall behind the Greenidges or Wallys of the world for his run a ball smackfests on flat tracks. I've put Kallis and Sanga down the batting order because I want them to utilise both of them as 2 players each, both being comfortably world class at their worse discipline, so I'd rather they not have to bat too long.

I don't think it's worth it to find a better keeper than Sanga because there are so few, and they are likely to lose most of the runs they saved when comparing their batting skill vs sanga anyway, no point in them taking up a spot when Sanga can do two people's work.

I think I'm pretty close , any thoughts?"

The one player I can't fit anywhere is Martin Crowe. Anyway. This is how I'd rank them."
25577,I would say kallis in any list
25578,"You are the definition of a brilliant contributor to this sub. 

Seems way more in-line than the ICC ratings."
25579,"Thank you, that means a lot. I hope it catches on, I would love to be a part of my country's emergence in the Cricket world ;)."
25580,I can't wait to see Afghanistan in the world cup. You guys have been improving. Very impressive.
25581,"> nistan in the world cup.

Yes, really great to see Afghanistan in the Cricket world cup 2015."
25582,Good luck mate. You're doing all the right things.
25583,To be fair - you've already been part of your country's emergence. Your contributions to this sub are a major reason why I've taken more interest in Afghanistan cricket and then association cricket.
25584,It's always the little thing that add up eh?
25586,That's a very good idea. I should probably seed the team colours using their distinctive country colours.
25587,Don't use their current ODI colors. Then it will all just be different hues of Green and Blue with a maroon thrown in.
25588,"The idea of indepth graphs for each country is also great, maybe I can create an example graph. Dare I ask what team you suggest I look at? Other than captaincy changes is there anything else you would like to look at?"
25590,I will make those graphs this weekend.
25591,"I'm fairly confused and feel like I need to see key results during each time period to see whether this is accurate. However, people here seem to be impressed so I think you've done well. In recent times it seems alright with NZ being 3rd in Tests and England being 6th. How did South Africa manage to fall so far down in ODIs between 2010 and 2013?"
25592,"I am not sure why SA fell so hard during that time. If I had to guess I would say it's because they lost games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand, all of which they had very good records against prior to that. I would have to look at it in depth though to get a better answer. If want to see the graph for any team for a specific period between 1998-2014 let me know, I can whip it up."
25593,"Yeah we had some pretty bad losses to some of the teams. India, Pakistan, England, NZ and Australia. [Statsguru](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;spanmax1=31+Dec+2013;spanmin1=01+Jan+2010;spanval1=span;team=3;template=results;type=team;view=results)

Does your algorithm give more points to a lower ranked team beating a higher ranked one? Something along the lines of ELO. If so the losses to Pakistan and NZ might have had a big impact on the rankings."
25594,"Well, the algorithm takes account of the current standings of each team against every other team. Then it creates a ranking based on the *collective data*. So, when a lower ranked team beats a higher one, the effect of it is taken into account for *all* teams."
25595,Very interesting. So it might not have been just a case of SA losing so much but also other teams having a bunch of wins?
25596,Yep :). Could have even been that a team that had beaten SA before started losing a lot of games. That would mean that a bad team has beaten SA. It looks at everything together.
25597,"Do you also account for home/away conditions? NZ is probably the best when it comes to home advantage but they shouldn't be ranked 1st because all they play is home series.

Between NZ fans.. This is just an example.. I love you guy's record at home n rooting for you even though being an Indian fan"
25598,Any chance of having a look at your ranking algorithm? Am interested to see the moving parts.
25599,"Sure, but the code is not commented and it's far from well written. I am not sure if you would prefer to see the current format or wait to see a well written format in the coming weeks. If you want a peak though, I create a matrix where the rows and columns represent teams. The entries are state how each team is doing against the other. The rankings is then derived from the eigenvalue decomposition. The rest of it is just making the rank between 0 and 100 for aesthetics."
25600,I'd be happy with the messy code if you're happy to share. Totally understand if you'd prefer to wait until you've cleaned it up though. But would definitely like to see it up on Github or something.
25601,Let's wait for now.
25602,"Is this an established method of ranking? If so, what is it called? I'd love to read about it!"
25603,"I'm not much of a programmer but dig the maths, I'd be real keen to see that write up if you do get around to it!"
25604,"I want to see it too! I assumed you would use the good old ELO ranking system, until I saw the y-axes of your plots."
25605,"Wonderful work, this is awesome. My only suggestion is having the actual rating beside each team name, it is difficult to see actual ratings without a gridline."
25606,That made it much better! Great suggestion. I will include it along with consistent line colours across graphs in the next set.
25607,"Awesome. Follow up question: would it be possible to create two sets of rankings, one for home and one for away matches? There are some teams where I think there would be a large discrepancy between the two. 

Looking forward to the interactive rankings, it will be awesome to be able to manipulate the data yourself."
25608,"Hm, it would be possible to only include home games for teams the user picks. That's an awesome feature. Thanks."
25609,"I find it interesting that Bangladesh and Ireland have an almost identical trend and the gap stays about the same for the last 10 years. On the other hand, New Zealand and Zimbabwe have almost opposite trends throughout the entire period."
25610,The other associates seem to have a similar trend as well. Once I have data dating further back we can see whether the emergence of Sri Lanka followed a similar path as well.
25611,I'm sure at one point in 20011/12ish England were the number one ranked odi side. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
25612,"I think I remember that too, but that is the ICC rankings not the one I have devised."
25613,"Excellent work! Along with records and averages, there's nothing I like more than a good ranking system. Just by eye, your system seems to capture all the right ups and downs over the last few years. How have you achieved this wizardry?

Edit: please put this on a website somewhere, and keep it up to date. It could be such a great reference."
25614,"Thanks! I will write up the method soon. The essential tool in this that is different from the ICC rankings is the use of eigenvalue decomposition rather than updating two teams after a series. So for example, if India beats Australia in a series and Australia goes on to beat England in a series, then this counts as a plus for India as well. There are other differences as well, but I will discuss them in the write up."
25615,"So at any point in time you're sort of looking for the optimal ranking for all teams, not just the ones who played last?  Sounds great. Will look forward to the writeup.

Yeah the ICC one is a kind of mutant distant cousin of an ELO rating, which is easy to calculate and 'right' over the long term, but very unresponsive. I think one of the problems is that the time it takes to adjust to a team's form is similar to the time it takes for the team's form to change."
25616,"Yep, exactly!"
25617,"Well this is deeply fascinating. I would love to see this in an interactive format on the Web (and indeed the /r/cricket sidebar once it's been thoroughly QA'd). Any chance on posting the algorithm, or is it something you'd like to keep to yourself for now?"
25618,"My math is good, but coding with strings is completely new to me. I am almost embarassed to post it. I have been learning somethings as I have been going along. Perhaps I will do a proper write up, comment the code, and graph some suggestions and post it all together. If you guys would like I can post the code as is as well, but I don't know how comprehensible it would be."
25619,"Something about the South African ODI ranking for the last three years just doesn't look right to me. I don't know if it's indicative of the quality and strength of the team they were in that period compared to the opposition in the top 6 - also, I'd rather that graph was top 8 rather than 6, so that NZ and Windies were in there."
25620,"Looks right to me.

Since 2010, SA has been going through a rebuilding phase with the ODI side. Losses both home and away.

It really is only over the last year and a half or so that SA has been stringing ODI performances together"
25622,I will put out a write up in the coming weeks.
25623,These results should be a sticky post on this sub. Brilliant brother man....
25624,"Thanks bro, I will make some updated charts and hopefully a website where the user can choose the era/format/teams and other options and have the graphs displayed. Perhaps that can be in the side bar at some point. :)"
25625,IA
25626,Lovely work. Definitely better than the ICC ranking system. And looking forward to website.
25627,Me too!
25628,"Not to critique too harshly what is awesome work it is more a philosophical point: shouldn't teams that play more cricket (either in that form or overall) be somewhat advantaged in the rankings. I would also council about going too far the other way with the ICC rankings being very steadfast and your rankings poo-pooing a decent team after a bad run.

One more thing I'd think you could evaluate perhaps the venue could be taken into account. For example an Indian team winning in England is worth more than a Pakistani team winning in India. There are other examples of this but the premier example of this is it is very hard to beat a subcontinent team if you aren't from the subcontinent so perhaps weighing could be given to this."
25629,"I definitely will be adding the home/away advantage. It's a good idea. I tried to make it a balance between adapting and maintaining over ""bad runs""."
25630,"wow.  brilliant work.  this is probably better than any ranking system i've seen over the years.  any way to extend this to rank individual players?

and which team would be the best ODI team in history?  my money is on cronje's team around '96-99."
25631,"Australian ODI team 1999-2007, dude.

CHECK OUT THESE TRIPS!"
25632,"Australian 2003 World Cup Team. Ponting, McGrath, Gilchrist, Bevan, Lee, Martyn, Hayden, Symonds and Gillespie.

Warne was around the team at the same time, but was banned just prior to the tournament. 

You can see the clear space between Aus and SA (and anyone else) on the graph."
25633,"Thanks :). It can be extended to individual players, but it does get more computationally intensive because there are many more players than teams. 

The data I collected dates to the early 1990s and it takes data for about 6 years to compute the ranking. So the earliest rank I have is from 1996 or so and indeed the highest ranked ODI team is Cronje's team around '96-99. On the other hand Australia has been ranked first in ODIs for a longer period than all the other teams combined in the period shown."
25634,Great work!!! looking forward to the algorithm!
25635,"Looked at the rankings for SA and was all WTF!? Then I realized it is for ODI's and I thought, well, it's pretty accurate..."
25636,"Wow, this is some extensive work. It seems to be a fairly accurate representation of ranking over a long period of time.

Looking forward to seeing more."
25637,"Damn I'm late to the party! Let me just start by saying this is amazing work. I would really love to read your work if you have published this anywhere. I'd also love to see this website go live. Here're my two cents to make your work even better.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
> At this point the algorithm only takes into account win/draw/loss and I would like to include margins in the future. 

There is a [summary paper](http://mathstore.ac.uk/headocs/8311_duckworth_f_duckworthlewis.pdf) by Duckworth (yes, that one) where he says that D/L is a much better way of assessing victory margins compared to the currently used methods, namely NRR.

> For instance, they still prefer to stick with ‘net run rate’ as a second criterion for splitting sides in leagues or min-leagues, despite the D/L based alternatives that are available.

I have read it in one of their previous papers but can't currently place it. You should definitely dig around there if you want to include margins. I'll PM you if I find it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Also let me know if you need any help with collecting data. I have an ever-growing collection of cricket data and can help you set up jobs that can download data from cricinfo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I also have an algorithm in mind for creating more fair player rankings, which I expect you'd want to include at some point. So let me know if you want to team up on it..."
25638,PM'd.
25639,Those colours...can't tell them apart. Being red-green colour deficient doesn't help either.
25640,I will make sure to include colour-blind friendly versions in the next installment.
25641,Seems brilliant but curse my colourblind eyes!
25642,I will make sure to include a colourblind friendly option next time :)
25643,There is no way India can be first in those preliminary results
25644,"That's an extremely in-depth analysis that arguably can be determined just by fans watching how good that team was. 

Actually I feel like I took for granted how extraordinary the Aussies at their peak were."
25645,"Quote from the author in the comments

""That is where the 100 Test streak between 1453(1999) and 1857(2008) is probably the more devastating and more unbeatable sequence. Those 100 Tests had a RAAPP average of 63.066: the equivalent of winning every match by 7 wickets or by 200+ runs. That, to me is, Bradmanesque. 
Ananth""

Thats Gilchrist's career right there.

Fuck I love Gilly"
25646,[latest robelinda2 Gilly vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk4SJld6uqQ)
25647,Jesus Christ who uses Cyan for the background
25648,"IMO Gilchrist and Warne mustve made a real difference to Australia, A keeper who averaged 50 for most of his career and a world class spinner that Windies Never had. Its hard to compare players/teams that played in different times, but IMO Waugh's australia just nips LLyod's windies."
25649,"Adam Gilchrist at number 6, Warne at 7 and Lee at 8 must have been the most disheartening tail any ever bowled to. Once you'd finally seen off Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh and Martyn you had those three to deal with. One their day they were worth 300. How can it not be the best side of all time with that going for it?"
25650,And Gillespie was worth a solid 200
25651,"To be fair, he was a number three then..."
25652,">Adam Gilchrist at number 6, Warne at 7 and Lee at 8 must have been the most disheartening tail any ever bowled to.

How can it not be the best side of all time with that going for it?

You underestimate them. Gilchrist, Warne and Lee usually came in at 7, 8 and 9. The top six was Hayden, Langer, Ponting, M Waugh, S Waugh and Martyn for the early part, then Martyn moved to number four and guys like Love, Lehmann, Symonds, Katich, Clarke, and Hussey juggled the number 5 and 6 spots. The batting strength was insane. Australia essentially had seven batsmen in their Test team at the time, while every other team had five or six."
25653,"They also had Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee at the same time. All of them are among the top wicket takers of all time. 

As good as the batsmen were, McGrath and Warne were better. I was too young to really appreciate it 100% at the time, but that team was insane all round. On top of that Andrew Symonds damn near revolutionised fielding as well - what a lot of people forget is that Australia was an era ahead of the rest in the field for the early stages of that team."
25654,"In response to the tail, what we have now must be quite devastating. Johnson, starc, harris, pattinson... whoever else is in the team. Considering most of those guys have won us games with the bat, makes you realise they have and will continue to be. The almost only thing i can think t20 cricket for, we expect more all round."
25655,"The T20 explanation would explain why the standard of batting is up while bowling is down but I'm not really sure - Australia has a fair history over the last few decades of wagging tails (I'm thinking back tot he likes of Paul Reifel) but this one was the best. 

It was even better in that Gilchrist was coming in and making tonnes when we were already 5-500. Johnson and the others have been fighting rearguards for the current team."
25656,"In the recent tri-series final, an Australian bowler batting in his usual position of number 8 scored 40 off 37 balls... and both his ODI career batting average and strike rate went *down* as a result. Ridiculous."
25657,"I'm surprised to see Ricky Ponting's team was so close to rivalling Waugh's team, but then I do think people underrate his captaincy. He kept Australia dominant, and I think he did a good job."
25658,"Nah, he coasted on Waugh's coat tails for the early stages and when everyone retired at once (something that should have been planned for but clearly wasn't), he wasn't able to do much at all. He had some great patches with the bat afterwards but Ponting didn't come close to Border, Taylor or Waugh (or Clarke as it turns out) and I think he was never the same player again after he became captain. 

I've been regularly accused of being a Ponting hater though (even though he is one of my all time favourite players)."
25659,"Well see it's no wonder he didn't do so well when the best team Australia has seen left, the average for Ponting's wonder team was only 2 points less than Waugh's, third best of all time. You could say Waugh rode on Tubby's coat tails, and Tubby on Border's coat tails."
25660,"Didn't need a research to tell me this; yes, Waugh's Australia are the best cricket team of all time!"
25661,"Call it a tie between Waugh's Aussies, and Lloyd's West Indians"
25662,In my mind the topic of which team would win in a head to head match up is one of the best convos in Cricket. Wish i got the chance to watch the Windies live to see for myself.
25663,"Then you add in ""at what ground"" and whether the pitches are covered and you have a solid night of conversation."
25664,Yeah. Unfortunately I never got the chance to watch the Windies live and was a bit young (8/9) to really understand just how good Waugh's Australia was. But I have listened into my dad and older relatives talk about it and its a fascinating convo.
25665,I am currently reading a collection of Ian chappels articles from 80s. Windies attack was monotonous and on a bad day their lack of variety was shown clearly. With Warnie in Aussie side and Waughs/Ponting's side matching Lloyds team batting I would go with Aussies.
25666,Not too many bad days though
25667,"WI of the 70s and 80s will always be (subjectively) better for me. Waugh's team were very good, but I got more enjoyment from watching the Windies. Both could be bullies on their day (Sir Viv was not averse to excessive and intimidatory appealing) but I always found the WI to be more exciting and better to watch. Plus they had Marshall.

I'm kind of reminded of *The Damned United*, Brian Clough commenting on Leeds before taking the post (and yes, I am aware that it's a work of fiction): ""They've been champions, yes, but they've not been *good* champions, in the sense of wearing the crown well."" Waugh's team will be remembered for being highly talented and successful, but I cannot bring myself to love them.

It's a similar reason that I prefer Lara to Tendulkar. Completely subjective, and disregarding of the stats. But Lara somehow is a better embodiment of the spirit of cricket to me than Tendulkar. In many ways it's unfortunate that they were contemporaries, because otherwise I'd see Tendulkar in a more positive light."
