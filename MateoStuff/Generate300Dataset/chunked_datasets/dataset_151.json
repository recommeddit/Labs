56317,I got the LG 27GN850. It’s the same IPS Panel as the Dell and was significantly cheaper as it was on sale at my local Best Buy. I’m overall happy with it
56318,"27GL850-B is sooooo sweet, I love the colors of this panel but I'm still waiting on a GPU to max it out as my 5700xt only hits a peak of 120 fps in any of the games I play."
56320,"Anything under HDR1000 is shit, along with windows implementation of it. The 10-bit color is damn good, there’s also a few individual color settings I found on /r/monitors that made it look even better."
56321,I have the LG GN850 too. Not taken out of its box yet.
56322,I will let you know If I end up finding the perfect one :D
56323,"Ive first bought a G7, returned it twice and therefore was able to test 3 different units. Wasn’t happy. Like... something did make me unhappy with the monitor. I think it was a combination of its sheer bulkyness, weird BLB, poor viewing angles (I am used to 2013 MacBook Pro IPS) and the RGB features of ALL the Units making weird, very-high pitched noises. Returned the last one too and got the MSI. I am really happy. Yes there’s glow but tbh? I am loving it. It has great blacks! Like, for real. And the unhappiness I’ve had with the G7 is nowhere to be found . I’ve got so much desk space and the viewing angles don’t remind me every minute about having to sit DEAD CENTER in order to not be distracted by weird discolorations. And it’s whisper quiet. And 2xHDMI. Really man. Try it out. And compared to the LG and Dell (which are basically the same monitor) its just better. At least that’s what the reviews say.

Edit: typos and grammar"
56324,"I had a MacBook Pro years ago and I remember loving the display, never knew they were IPS. Any manufacturers besides Apple make displays like those with the glossy front that have decent gaming performance?"
56325,"I don’t know Really. But what makes the MBP displays so nice is the combination of Resolution, colors and the viewing angles."
56326,"Surprised no one has mentioned this yet:

56327,"For what it’s worth, I have another MSI monitor from the mag series (mag27cqr) and I absolutely love it. My only complaint is that it won’t run 120hz at 1440p with the series X, but that might be Microsoft’s fault. Works just fine with my pc & looks great. If that other mag is a better monitor then I imagine it must seriously kick ass."
56328,"> Dell S2721DGF

I've had one for around 6 months and I highly recommend it. The IPS glow it's a lottery as usual, mine has a orange glow on the bottom right, if you put a black background and actively it is very noticeable but in practice I've yet to notice it on an everyday use."
56329,"Thanks for your reply! I am leaning towards the Dell because its on sale now where I live and in stock and from reviews I've seen it is very good. 

I've just watched the Hardware Unboxing video of the MSI MAG that I mentioned above and it seems to surpass the Dell and LG slightly in all areas, but it's roughly €160 more expensive than the Dell and LG, so I'm a bit torn on what to go for. Not sure if I should fork out the extra for the MSI.

As for the glow, is that something you would notice while using the monitor for gaming & working? Or is it only noticeable when the monitor is on standby? If it only happens on standby I don't think it would bother me at all."
56330,"I've never noticed it in gaming/multimedia/working. Another very good point of this monitor for me is the integrated 4x USB type A ports, it's pretty useful"
56331,Let me know for sure. I just went the the research/buying process last month and always love hearing other people’s opinions.
56332,"I ended up going for the Dell S2721DGF. It was on sale where I live and I got an additional discount on it, so I got the monitor for €420 delivered. 

I was set on getting the MSI MAG274QRD-QD but the cheapest I could find it was €680 which is too expensive for me currently. Also I looked at a lot of reviews for both monitors and the MSI seems to be the best one but the Dell is also meant to be excellent too and was a good bit cheaper."
56333,I’d also add the LG 27gl83a-b along with the 850
56334,Get the g7! Its such a versatile monitor
56335,">Considering the price point I would expect to have 0 issues just like my LG CX

Just buy another LG CX and put it on your table. It's like four 24"" 1080p monitors!"
56336,"In my experience 48"" is just too big.  It's an amazing monitor, but even wall mounted at the end of a 36"" desk, it's still too close for me."
56337,don’t mind me here researching deep desks for my incoming 48” cx lol
56338,"When I look at all the monitors I've owned and used when I look back at a damn good monitor I think of the LG 32GK850G. It gad Gsync, good contrast, no overblown colours and solid sRGB out of the box. I really had everything except the PPI at 1440p 32"" felt wrong to me, just lacked the sharpness I'd expect and feel 27"" is really the max, obviously a matter of opinion. I feel myself sitting further back than I used to and if one shows up on eBay, I wouldn't hesitate to grab myself one because it's just a fantastic display.

Most high refresh rate, good performing gaming monitors are IPS apart from the 32"" LG and G7. IPS monitors for the most part have the spec I look for in a monitor but I see IPS displays as lacking basic picture quality fundamentals, don't get me wrong no LCD is perfect but VA monitors are able to produce the deep black and solid overall picture that IPS can't touch.

 I currently own the AW2721D and it has good out of the box gamma curves, some of the best I've seen, and while the red point is toned down and it's tastefully tuned, it's still inaccurate for the most part and offers very little dynamic range and colour depth in SDR. When I think about it, it's pretty much half a monitor to me because it just cannot produce SDR content as intended because it's lacking in dark range. I'm torn because it also has great gradient handling, colour blend is essentially perfect leading to excellent colour distinction, the light antiglare coating also ideal.

Some great elements to this display but it's still not a great display overall. IPS panels will always have these limitations for SDR content and it's starting to mirror how their TV's are. IPS TV's are failing and have been for years. It took year for companies to start using good VA panels and now that they've come to monitors it's starting to make IPS seem like a bad choice for anyone who wants great picture quality. The G7 and G9 and the evolution of those displays will make it difficult for IPS overall especially when wide viewing film comes to monitors which is really IPS only strength over VA. 

I can see the flat G7's being pretty much the go to monitor assuming QC is tight."
56339,"32 inch 4K OLED. 120hz+

You'll find it next to the real holy grail."
56340,Add 21:9 or even wider options and I have my holy grail.
56341,"As someone who doesn't play esports games, OLED with 4K120 with VRR is the perfect as it gets but never been convinced that 48"" is usable on desktop environment. So I'm still holding out for 42"" OLED."
56342,If they ever came out with a CX in 27 or 32 inches . . I think all monitors would become irrelevant unless you only care about eports play lol. THAT would be the dream
56343,I think Gigabyte recently announced an oled panel that will be in the 30s inches
56344,"I believe only the 48"" is OLED. (they use LG's OLED panels, of which 48"" is their smallest)
https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/blog/gigabyte-aorus-fo48u-with-48-oled-panel-4k-resolution-120hz-and-hdmi-2-1/"
56345,"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled

This was the article I found.  Looks like the verge made a mistake on their original reporting and had to update."
56346,Source please!!
56347,"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled

Looks like Verge updated the article that only the 48 is OLED when originally reporting all were OLED"
56348,"True but the 32"" one they announced seems to be targeted for professional market. 60hz only and 3 grand."
56349,"Yeah screw that, 120hz minimum for me"
56350,"Yeah they are outsourcing the OLED panels for that one, so way more expensive and lacking the features of LG OLED panels. The 42"" will be their own though. It's also a very efficient size to manufacture, so could be quite a bit cheaper than the 48"".

Still too big for my tastes, but if it's around $1,000 I don't know how long I'll be able to resist given the generally paralyzed state of monitors."
56351,Yeah. I also think 42 is still on the side of being too big but it’s a size I’m willing to work with unlike 48.
56352,"Actually it appears that it's the least efficient size to manufacture and only uses 70% of a glass panel (less efficient), so the price will be very close to the 48"" TV. [https://www.tomsguide.com/news/lg-oled-tvs-may-finally-get-cheaper-this-year-heres-why](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/lg-oled-tvs-may-finally-get-cheaper-this-year-heres-why)

"" Those efficiencies mean that 48-inch TVs could reduce in price significantly in comparison to last year’s models. Don’t expect the 42-inch to beat it by a huge amount though as its yields are much worse. There are new techniques which could improve the 42-inch panel yield to 87%, but they come with additional production complexity, and therefore higher cost.  ""

EDIT - This may not be factually correct information. Please see below comments."
56353,"That's Tom's article is a bit messed up. They are regurgitating info from two tech report articles - the older tech report article is based on LG getting 8 42"" screens out of a sheet, but the newer article is based on LG getting 10+ 42"" screens out of a sheet. Improvements that were theoretical in February seem to have been established by March."
56354,"Ahh interesting, thanks."
56355,"Waiting for the 42"" OLED panel from LG that was announced. Will make everything else obsolete in my opinion."
56356,"There are those who'll still prefer 144 or even higher refresh rate at lower resolution. But otherwise, yes. I think this will be endgame for many since it'll be a perfect for both PC and consoles."
56357,"I'm still a pleb that's on 32"" 4k60. So that 4k120 will be a jump I can see. I've not been spoiled with 144 or 240, so I won't know what I'll be missing I guess. :P"
56358,"Trust me, you will just stay on your desktop moving windows to indulge the smooth screen. I have 2 pc's, 1080p and 4K gaming, and my 4K monitor is 60hz whilst my 1080p is 165hz. Honestly, I appreciate high refresh rate more than the higher resolution."
56359,"42"" 4:3 ratio is still TV size and too big/unergonomic for the average desk."
56360,"Any news on when its coming out? 

Found the CX48 for £998 on QVC and I almost paid for it yesterday but 48 inches just pushes the limits on the amount of space i have for it. I may still go for it if LG dont release the 42 inch by May-June as im impatient and the cx48 is still great but 42 would be optimal for me"
56361,"No news, unfortunately. The only thing we know for certain is that LG Display announced a 42"" panel along with the 83"" one in a press release in January. No manufacturer has announced an actual TV or monitor with with the panel yet."
56362,"I'm honestly thinking it won't happen until the end of the year. They want to make money off their new models in bigger sizes first probably.

I watched all the youtube videos of the 48"" as desktop use and everyone eventually says it's just a bit too big and end up switching it out. I got to curb my impulse buy based on that haha"
56363,Damn. I’m really tempted as I’ve got a 3090 but my Acer predator xb281hk is just crap with motion blur and colour accuracy. I will be about 90cm away from the CX48 as I’d wall mount it but even then I’m not sure if it’s enough
56364,"This sub seems to think stuff like this but there's no way. Firstly unless it's able to hit and sustain 1000nits, it won't be a true HDR display, most OLEDs are around 600nits give or take, not too different than the top performing HDR600 monitors like the G7, AW2721D, GN950 for example. 

Where obviously the OLED wins out is lack of backlight for black depth, it's superior to any LCD here and overall is a superior experience to other HDR600 displays and superior to any LCD regardless of brightness coverage when it comes to dark extension but when it comes to producing highlights and creating a dynamic top end they do not produce that.

Most HDR1000 sets with Full Array are just simply better for HDR use and while they do produce halos in dark scenes, they can still create good black depth, enough so that it's true to the content unless the content as purposely made with OLED in mind to which most content isn't which is why OLEDs need more tinkering.

OLEDs are a niche product, the 42"" will sale for more and  I can assure you most people will go for a gaming monitor than fork out for an OLED which will degrade in a couple of years and still has the same issues like uniformity, white, grey, just like all panels regardless of tech. OLED is superior in a few aspects, no1 is denying that, I use 4 at work for various tasks and I have my own trusty B8 that I use and abuse for all content at home but they're not perfect and the savior like people on this sub like to make out."
56365,"42” OLED TV for most likely $1000 vs how much are those super HDR monitors? $2000? $3000? Unless you’re using your monitor in a super bright room, you’ll probably appreciate the blacks of the OLED more than the lack of peak brightness. But this is an opinion. 

The main issue is that monitor makers have simply kept the industry stagnant and charge a hefty premium. Like how Intel operated until AMD delivered Ryzen. So I’m more excited at the prospect of all these companies soon feeling the heat over their overpriced offerings.

Burn in is the biggest con of OLED for monitor usage, and price is the biggest con of these high end gaming monitors."
56366,"&#x200B;

agree completely"
56367,"I’m currently having the Aw2721D, and it’s fucking amazing. Absolutely brilliant color and very minimal, if not not at all IPS glow, plus high refresh rate and low pixel response time. It’s not better than the G7, per se, but I find that the alienware got better quality control. I used 3 G7 before moving on to the alienware. My first G7 got this weird pink tint on the monitor when turning on HDR, so got an exchange for that. The next one had a really weird flickering black bar on the left side of the monitor, so that got returned as well. The next one got busted monitor stand, as I cannot adjust its height, it’s always at the lowest position and cannot raise it. I returned that and got the alienware. It was amazing from the start no problem whatsoever. Also, the AW2721D’s contrast ratio is very desirable, especially for IPS panels, imo"
56368,"Would you recommend buying the alienware for $650 USD with tax and shipping included?

I'm waiting for dell to ship, but it's been about a month.

I don't know if I should get the alienware or a 1440p 165hz.

Thanks!"
56369,"Same here, bought the alienware but its been a month same time as my PC, but no news since then from Dell -_-"
56370,"Ugh.. It's so bad right now. They don't even give an estimate shipping time.

60hz is unplayable for fps games after playing for years at 144hz.

Are you going to wait it out or look into something else?"
56371,"Im definitly going to wait for it cause the specs are so dam good and the garanty sounds dope.
Tho Im gonna have to borrow a screen to a friend and maybe buy a second cheap monitor if they keep on not producing.
Im expecting about 2 months of wait from what I read but it could be more. 
What irritating is not knowing when they'll come"
56372,"2 months, oh wow!

Yeah, it's very annoying playing a guessing game and asking people on reddit, lol.

I'd wait for the G7 flat, but it's probably going to be expensive and who knows when it will release."
56373,"At this point reading people's shipping dates and delay to estimate mine became almost obsessive 😅

Yeah the G7 sounds nice, hope you buy it quick when the flat comes out, it already sounds popular :p"
56374,"For $650 that's a really good price. I paid $820 at Microcenter today for one and honestly I feel like it was worth it at that price, if you're willing to wait then hell yeah get it and save some money. It's a damn near perfect monitor IMO"
56375,"Alright, thanks for your input!

I probably don't need 240hz, but I want it and if I get a 165hz.. I'll probably regret it in the future, lol."
56376,Am I missing something? I was just looking at this monitor on dells site and it’s showing 5 day delivery time and in stock?
56377,"Yeah, that's the estimate delivery date, but I've been waiting for a month for mine to ship. Other people have been waiting too."
56378,"That’s nuts, I can’t believe they show that estimated delivery time and you guys are just sitting and waiting. I’m guessing the 3 year panel swap is the reason for not just grabbing it in stock on Amazon then?"
56379,"Ehh, not the 3 year panel swap, but that might be a good reason to get it fro. dell.

I got the monitor for $810 CDN total and on Amazon it goes for $1080 with tax and everything.

So I could spend the extra $270 for shipping, but that is a lot of money for a monitor and I'd probably get a 1440p 165hz monitor instead."
56380,"I just got one as well, fantastic in so many categories but my main gripes:

* The IPS glow is bad, like REALLY bad, even more distracting than the color shift I had on my previous TN panel.  Tweaking the levels and getting used to it has helped, but it's probably my biggest problem with the monitor
* The lack of DSC is also major letdown, not being able to do HDR at 240 Hz is going to bite me in the ass in the future, especially with Auto-HDR solutions arriving very soon
* The local dimming is garbage but that's just the way things are right now in the market

I had a ton of problems with my G7 and I did not regret returning it one bit"
56381,">  The IPS glow is bad, like REALLY bad, even more distracting than the color shift I had on my previous TN panel. Tweaking the levels and getting used to it has helped, but it's probably my biggest problem with the monitor 

We all have our things we tolerate but this is exactly why I no longer have a single IPS display in my house and never will again. Every last one of them is complete trash. One day I hope to say the same about LCD's entirely and finally move beyond this subpar garbage technology we have been forced to accept for so long. Maybe then I can finally get my Trinitron off my desk too."
56382,">Maybe then I can finally get my Trinitron off my desk too.

Considering that's probably 400:1 or 500:1 ANSI, I'm surprised you haven't gotten ridden of that yet. There's no IPS glow, I suppose, but a G7 would still crush it for picture quality."
56383,"The ""Holy Grail"" would be something with FALD, but those are generally not 1440p. You have the Asus PG35VQ, which is a 1440p ultra wide, but it is a VA and does have some black smear.

Outside of 1440p you have the PG27UQ and the (soon the be released) PG32UQX. Those are quite expensive however (The PG32UQX will be $3k). 

If all of that is too much to bay, then The G7 is probably the best bet of the ""good but under absolute premium"" market."
56384,"The black smear is very minimal and a non-issue in my opinion. 

Having said that, the retail price makes it not viable as an option in my opinion.

I got mine for 1 month old for $1200 over a year ago, and even though it's a great monitor, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over $1000.

My CX blows it out of the water in literally every way, other than the refresh rate. 

It has now been relegated to playing FPS and displaying my timeline in after effects.

Edit: Saw something about the [new G9](https://www.overclock3d.net/news/gpu_displays/samsung_s_next-gen_odyssey_g9_deliver_super-wide_5k_at_240hz_with_hdr2000/1) being 240hz, mini led with over 2k zones, HDR2000 certification. So if anything, that's likely to be the new holy grail until high refresh rate oled monitors hit the market."
56385,"> The black smear is very minimal and a non-issue in my opinion. 

That's what everyone used to using VA panels says."
56386,"I mean, I had a TN panel as my primary for gaming before this, do all my singleplayer gaming on my OLED and have a lot of experience on IPS too.

The black level smearing exists, but only in scenes with extreme contrast and very fast motion. I primarily use the panel for competitive FPS and it's perfectly acceptable in terms of average g2g. Again, non-issue imo considering the monitor's specs. 

Would take this HDR1000 200hz 1440p ultrawide over any IPS panel on the market if we're disregarding price.

Having said that, I've used lower-end VAs at friends' houses before and some of them are literally unusable for fast paced games imo."
56387,"Exactly. I switched from AOC 27G2 (IPS) to AOC CQ27G2 (VA) and the black smearing is obvious. I gained higher resolution but lost a lot of motion clarity.

The IPS at low overdrive is clearer than the VA at max overdrive.

However, the high contrast ratio is quite nice."
56388,"See FALD is the least important factor to me. Color depth and black levels, sure, but motion clarity/refresh rate is by far first. I think different people look at different things, like OLED is great to me for the above reasons, the brightness or even contrast ration itself, outside absolute blacks much less so. And the pixel response is far more impressive to me (I hate ghosting and crap) i think with the pixel response too the 120hz seems closer to 144hz on an IPS or VA. But to each their own.

And that's the clincher, other than something doing everything other than ultra-high refresh like the CX its probably just preferance + budget."
56389,"OLED is superior in many ways to FALD (including mini-LED as far as I have seen) but it is susceptible to burn in. Aside from that, I agree the CX is a very good product and the price is fair compared to what mini-LED is commanding. Even with a high number of zones, FALD has noticeable blooming in some situations. It's a kludge compared to OLED. Hopefully there will be computer-oriented desktop OLED panels soon, 48"" is still pretty huge."
56390,NO HDMI 2.1 I FUCKING CANT WITH THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID MARKET.
56391,I'd rather get a 4k 144hz monitor. Unless you are buying this monitor specifically for competitive gaming I think the difference between 144hz and 240hz isn't enough to justify 1440p vs 4k. 4k is a significant improvement and the only real issue would be if your pc can actually run it.
56393,"I think the Non-QD version might be the one to go for, the wider gamut on the QD is just absolutely overkill for almost anyone and from what i've seen, the Non-QD version has better yields QC-wise"
56394,"Dell will launch 4 new gaming monitors in the upcoming months. I'm going for the 27inch, all VA panels except the 25inch ips.

56397,I've got a G7 but I really wish there was a non curved option
56398,Its coming.
56399,"I just upgraded my Omen 27i (27"" 1440p 165Hz 1ms nano IPS) to the Acer Predator XB273U GX (27"" 1440p 270Hz 1ms IPS). Like you, I was considering the AW and G7. I ruled out the G7 due to all the complaints and I was heavily leaning towards getting the AW. Even though I love gsync, I stopped using it for FPS games so I decided I wanted to try out ULMB which was presumably the best on the Acer (and not available on the AW). Pretty happy with my decision so far.

For competitive FPS, the higher refresh rate and reduced motion blur due to ULMB honestly feels like cheating. As soon as I snap onto heads, the image is instantly clear. Contrast that to a hint of smearing/ghosting when I did the same on the Omen.

I don't want to exaggerate so maybe not everyone will feel like the Acer is an upgrade. However, the Omen definitely feels like a downgrade in comparison (though, at the time, it felt like a considerable upgrade over my 1440p 100Hz 8ms VA ultrawide)."
56400,The omen already seems so fast to me but I'm returning it due to horrible screen uniformity. There's no reviews yet of the 270hz predator right?
56401,"Yeah, I was impressed with the Omen as well so I never thought I'd ever consider it a downgrade to anything. But 270Hz and ULMB is pretty awesome.

There's 2 decent reviews of the Predator on youtube: Bijan and therightplace."
56402,"Is the frame rate still smooth when gaming around 120 fps at 270hz with ULMB?

I find my games look sort of choppy at 120-130 fps at 144hz with ULMB.

I have a benq XL2730z and if the framerate isnt above 144hz it looks choppy with ULMB (especially in Apex Legends)"
56403,"Forgot to mention I was using ULMB with Siege, 220-300 fps on low with a 3080. Haven't tested anything lower yet."
56404,Let me know. I'm interested in this monitor
56405,"For gaming purposes, I'm waiting for the Viewsonic Xg2431 with the Blurbuster 2.0 certification. Good size to res ratio, IPS, and the top level motion blur reduction is something I'm looking forward to experiencing for myself."
56406,"Same man, Good really good motion blur reduction on a IPS monitor is not very common. The best one right now IMO is the MSI MAG251RX"
56407,I have the G7 and it’s perfect. Am pretty confident they have fixed the previous issues you outlined.
56408,"Do you have the 27 or 32 inch?

Yes the flickering was fixed by turning on VRR, but that also introduces judder to certain games so to me it’s more like a bandaid fix . . if you have no issues I’m happy for you tho! it is a great monitor, in terms of picture quality it is definitely the closest I’ve seen in a monitor when compared to CX"
56409,"I don’t have flickering with or without VRR...

I have the 32”"
56410,Hmmm making me wanna go to Micro center and get the 32 inch to try it out lol
56411,"Just returned the 27inch and got the 32 inch from B&H for cheaper than anywhere else ($699 at B&H). Immediately feel I love with the curved screen, the immersion is just awesome. But 1000R curved screen on a 27 inch just wasn't enough screen real estate for me, felt like it was a 25 or 26 inch monitor.  
  
I mostly play games like Metro, Fallout 4, Control, ARPG's, and turn based RPG's like Divinity and Wasteland."
56412,"Dude you are a life saver. I just went to Micro Center to grab the 32inch cashed it out for $799 look at my phone and get a notification from you saying its $699 at BH . . Went back in the store asked if they could price match it and they did! Got $100 back! Thank you very much dude, I wish I could upvote you 20x. Just hooked up the monitor and will test it out to let you guys know what I think (:"
56413,"I price matched my 32"" G7 to $599 on black friday at micro center.  Definitely the best gaming monitor on the market.   Enjoy.  All the issues you listed with jitter/flickering were fixed in firmware updates.  Definitely just make sure your firmware is updated.

After using this G7, you couldn't pay me to go back to an IPS panel.  The excellent contrast of the VA and glow problems of IPS are a dealmaker/dealbreaker respectively.  I'll keep my G7 until OLED or miniLED become mainstream for monitors.

Both Hardware Unboxed and Rtings.com have the G7 as their #1 overall Gaming monitor and it has been for over 6 months now."
56415,"Which since they recommend the G7 over the alienware for gaming, that would make the G7 the #1 gaming monitor still."
56417,Update?
56418,"Am in the UK, not sure if that makes a difference lol"
56419,Exactly same for me
56420,G7 better than dell imo no competition however i would go 32 inch curved. Good shit.
56421,"I had the same question, but for 1440p/144Hz monitors under $400."
56422,I got the LG 27gn850 rival to the Dell s2721 same iOS panel and got an excellent deal at Best Buy. Says $499 online and paid $369
56423,I’m waiting for the M32Q to drop. Looks promising and has a KVM
56424,"I'm happy with Samsung CHG70 (1440p curved VA). The blacks are really deep. Since I had never used a VA panel monitor before I was impressed with the deep blacks. It feels more responsive than my old  IPS Asus VP249QGR and at least to me it doesn't feel like the colors are any worse. I don't get what black smearing is all about, I hope I never learn it \^\^"
56425,For me its the PG32UQX
56426,If you don't need more than 60Hz you can by one of the professional FALD monitors from Asus. Otherwise pretty much the usual suspects until new ones come later down in the year.
56427,"I would say it’s the Asus PG259QN and Dell AW2521H for 1080p, Dell AW2721D, Acer XB273U GX and Gigabyte FI27Q-X for 1440p and LG 27GN950 or upcoming 27GP950 for 4k"
56428,"The G7 doesn't have ""deep blacks"". The contrast is one of the worst when it comes to VA monitors.

What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve. It's around 2.4 and the blacks are even higher unless you lower the black equalizer (to lower the rest, set it to gamma mode 2). A properly calibrated G7 doesn't look as ""fun"" or special as a G7 with default settings. And yes, I own a G7 and a colorimeter."
56429,">What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve. It's

I'm actually glad you bought that up because I've seen it mentioned a lot about deep blacks and contrast but then people describe what is simply too high gamma. A calibrated display with a less and 1.0 dE and even curves is similar to how you describe a calibrated G7, not as fun. I've shown people a calibrated displays before and they've said it's washed out...no they're just used to overblown colours or colour boosted in the right areas to give them that pop.

Some content is created unbalanced so a gamma boost can help liven or and in some cases a boosted gamma is in deed fun, despite being a designer in the past, I sometimes like to have the naughty settings turned up, having an OLED with low black setting with content that wasn't mastered with that in mind can look technically crushed in areas but can add a little bit of atmosphere for shits and giggles. The G7 has that out of the box, it what   I would just call tastefully tuned, like the AW2721D is tastefully tuned in it's colour but it has an even gamma. 

I used to be an accuracy whore, my job forced that but now, live and let live, give me those naughty settings but I do like it within reason, none of this 4.0 dE shit."
56430,"> What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve.

Every panel is different. Your panel is not indicative of another panel even in the same product line. You absolutely can not make this claim accurately. Panels from the exact same line bought from the same batch can have completely different gamma curves, out of the box contrast ratios and even different color temperatures at the same values. 

This is why calibration is so *individual* and why you should not randomly apply settings that someone else tells you are *good* because whats good for one panel might be complete garbage for another.

> What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve.

Out of the box Gamma1 I had a gamma curve of around 2.3 (Samsung claimed calibration at 2.26)

After my final calibration I have a gamma curve of around 2.22 (Gamma2) with a contrast ratio of 2370:1 with my black equalizer to 12, contrast 75, brightness 25. 

Compared to OLED its pure garbage, compared to IPS it offers ""deep blacks"" and a ""contrasty"" look and it aint due to a 2.4 gamma curve because I dont have  2.4 gamma curve.

*edit*

Im using an x-rite ColorMunki. In all fairness..I only bought it for calibrating my CRT originally and im sure its not the best on the market for calibrations. So...maybe take that into account I guess."
56431,G7 flat once they come out. Ips glow is unacceptable
56432,VA has other issues like VA glow and obvious gamma shifting.
56433,I have the g7 and it does not have glow like the ips has and i also dont have issues looking at it from the side. Nothing that bothers me as much as ips glow does
56434,is flat confirmed?
56435,Samsung announced it at ces
56436,Niceeeee that was the only thing holding me back from the G7. Got an LG and very happy with it though.
56437,All monitors are shit. I would just buy the LG C1 48 inch TV.
56438,It is only good as a secondary screen. You really need a smaller screen tbh
56439,you all guys should stop with this tv meme
56440,CX 48 is better value imo as the differences are pretty minimal and there are already big discounts on the CX series.

Acer really stepped it up with this model. I bought the 27 inch and the 32 inch versions and they don't have any backlight bleed or dead pixels. The QC seems excellent on these"
56442,Dell s2721dgf is currently amazing for its price. Hardware unboxed reviewed it and gave it clear buying recommendation
56443,"I'm waiting for the 32"" 4k 144hz IPS monitors to come out. Currently use an Alternative AW3418DW and have been pretty happy with that it."
56444,">Considering the price point I would expect to have 0 issues just like my LG CX in the living room 

I swapped a 55CX for a 32G7 and I gotta say, my CX had more issues than my G7.

Don't get me wrong, OLED blacks are amazing and perfect viewing angles with glossy 4k at 55"" is fantastic but... 240Hz is just so much better.

My G7 was also damn near a third of the price of my CX coming in at <$500 USD."
56445,Why no one talks about Asus TUF VG27AQL1A ? That's the updated version and is competitive with LG head to head.
56446,"I've got a few 27GN950's, they are pretty good to me, but I'll swap them out for the upcoming 32inch 4k high hz monitors"
56447,I dream about a 200+ ppi 16:10 or 3:2 monitor
56448,"Holy grail could only be [blur busters certified monitor.](https://blurbusters.com/press-release-version-20-of-blur-busters-approved-certification-programme-with-viewsonic-xg2431-as-first-to-pass/) 

I would like the upcoming ELITE XG320U to pass it"
56449,"G7 is simply better, it is a bit faster (not really important though) and doesn't have any IPS or VA short comings."
56450,"Any flicker? As a Samsung 27"" C27FG70 owner with horrible flicker I'm not really that hyped about returning for seconds."
56451,"Nothing at all, even on older ""pre-fix"" 1008 firmware (using vega64)"
56452,"I'm waiting for MiniLED or at least MiniLED backlight (so pixel perfect local dimming). I'm not interested in giving thousands to an industry that still refuses to give us the monitor we want, only to compromise on colour, contrast, brightness, black levels, or something else very important to me. While I wait till the GPU and CPU markets settle so I can build a new PC, I can also wait for new monitors to arrive till then."
56453,"I got an Odyssey G7 32' last week. Great Monitor and after the last Windows 10 Update, HDR becomes Viable. I returned it 2 days later though.   
I'm a fan of a bit of Curve, 1800R is fine, even 1500R, but man, that 1000R Curve, everything looked distorted to me, Plus I got a bit of Nausea sometimes.  
Other people have got used to it though and they don't mind it anymore.  


Samsung will release Flat Versions of G7 in the Q2 of 2021, so if you want to wait like me, it's worth it, even though I'm not a fan of totally Flat Monitors, especially on VA Panels.

AW2721D, I'm thinking about it, but it has IPS Glow Issues plus Low Contrast compared to VA Panels, so I'm sceptical since I always game in total dark or low ambient light."
56454,"DO NOT BUY THE AW2721D!! Ive had it for a while now and i noticed that the borders of the screen started to emit an orange glow. It got really bad, so I used my warranty to swap it out with a new one, but the new one they shipped to me had a broken stand, horrible blb, and really bad pressure damage in the middle of the screen."
56455,"I don’t think the words “holy grail” should be used to describe a 1440p monitor... lol

why the fuck did I get downvoted? obviously minimum “holy grail” would be 4k144 but to take it up a notch you could go 5k miniled or even 6k pro XDR you dumb fucks"
56456,"As long as windows cant scale properly, i disagree"
56458,"And I don’t think “holy grail” should be used to describe anything under 240 Hz, and since it seems like you’re insinuating that 4K should be the holy grail, none of those would make the cut for me. I’d think the holy grail of all monitors would have to be one of the 1440p 240 Hz monitors. Since the 1080p 360 Hz monitor is not that great and can’t refresh the pixels in time for true 360 Hz, that will be the new holy grail for competitive players when they release a TN version."
56459,"Excuse me, 4K is standard. 5K is the holy grail. But the actual problem is that the holy monitor grail for a gamer is something entirely different from the holy monitor grail for somebody working in the creative industry. I haven’t seen 1440p since the mid 00s. 5K is the shit. I wouldn’t even know or it was impossible to see at which Hz it is running. And why would I need to. (It’s 60 Hz for the 5K iMac btw)"

56461,And that’s the holy grail of the holy grails
56462,"G7 has very heavy matte coating. With that screen there is no white color, just some kind of yellow/braunish puke. Tried to upgrade from chg70, but no way i pay so much for a downgrade."
56463,"""I currently have two contenders on my desk"" and NOW you're asking for advice? I hope I'm misunderstanding something, and you didn't just purchase and open two monitors at the same time, knowing full well you only wanted one of them at best. If so, you're literally the worst kind of customer and the rest of us pay for your entitled b.s. But again, maybe I'm assuming something wrong here. If so, then the above doesn't apply."
56465,"You're missing the point. They can never sell it as new again. I don't have a problem with someone returning something they aren't happy with, but buying multiple models knowing full well that the PLAN is to return one is just screwing over the seller, and screwing over the rest of us because the loss will always be passed down to the customer in the form of higher prices.  


Returns happen, but at least give the seller a CHANCE to not take a loss."
56466,I too have a pg279q that doesn’t seem to want to be replaced. Tried the xv272 and aw2721d. My aw had terrible contrast. Acer had bad blb and didn’t like the overshoot at lower fps. I ordered the x34 gs which hopefully will have little blb. 180hz. I wanted an ultrawide for d2 resurrected haha. 180hz is plenty fast I feel for fps games.
56467,"I currently have a ASUS VG27AQ 27inch IPS WQHD, and it's okay did find I had to do a lot of colour tweaking and fiddling with the settings to get it how I liked it."
56468,Best current “holy grail” of 1080p 240 hz monitors?
56469,"MSI MAG251RX imo, there’s also the AW2521HF if if you don’t need backlight strobing. The Alienware comes on sale on dell.com/ca and you can use code 10%OFFMONITOR for 10% off too"
56470,"Just to put it out there, Asus will soon be releasing a successor to the PG279Q called the PG279QM, which includes a native gsync module (which should hopefully eliminate the bad input lag at 60 hz that the XG279Q suffers from). If you're fine with waiting, I would honestly recommend that, as everything else on the market seems to have at least one fatal flaw."
56471,"I'm still waiting for a 4K 120+hz Gsync 27-32"" HDMI 2.1 monitor.

One of my two XB271HK 4+ year old monitors also started flickering very slightly on me. I might need to change my monitor arms if I'm upgrading up on using 32"""
56472,"do not upgrade to 32, you will hate all monitors"
56473,"huh? You don't want me to upgrade to 32"" but you also commented that you are waiting for a 32"" version of GN950?"
56474,"You will get spoiled, that is it"
56475,"I have two AW2721D’s. Went through 8 various LG Ultrawide 38s, and the AW3821, used to have a PG279q.  I’m a photo editor as well as gamer and I am extremely particular about my monitors.  The AW2721d was the only one I found with perfect panel uniformity, hardly any backlight bleed (considering it’s an IPS), and good enough contrast for editing photos.  While also having 240hz + 1440p, it’s a huge win imo.  I wouldn’t buy any other monitor at this point in time.  Although it might be worth waiting for that PG279QM that’s coming out soon."
56476,Damn 8 LG 38s?? I’ve never heard of someone even putting up with more than like 3 returns. What was wrong with them?
56477,"All through Amazon, so luckily I had easy returns, and I’m dumb…  but the panel uniformity would always be the issue.  Never below delta2 grey or black uniformities.  So basically green on one side, and pink on the other, pretty typical with curved screens unfortunately."
56478,"The Samsung's 110"" microLED TV but miniaturized to one eighth in size. Technically out of reach but a realistic expectation in the future. That's what ""Holy Grail"" means."
56479,"Holy grail for me since I play tac shooters (cs:go, Valorant, r6s) is the benq xl2546k . Good colors , 240hz .5 ms , dyac+ c , best ergonomics on a monitor"
56480,"One of the ones that aren't out yet from ViewSonic, ASUS, Aurous, Acer, or others I might be forgetting.32 inch 4k 144hz monitors this year with HDMI 2.1 this year. Id go with the PG32uq because I like the look and HDMI 2.1 the best shitty lineup this year because HDMI 2.1 is spotty. haven't really heard much about the gigabyte one."
56481,"I would keep the G7, but first I would turn off VRR Control and overclock the freesync range to 35-240hz to get rid of low fps brightness flickering and the judder caused by VRR control on."
56482,What do you run that goes down to 35 FPS?
56483,"Nothing, lowest fps my games dip into is 65fps, but LFC kicks in above the lower bound of freesync with Nvidia gpus. Forexample, in 35-240 range, the LFC kicks in from 0-48fps, or in the default range (60-240) LFC used to kick in at 0-80fps and that caused the heavy brightness flickering, so I increased the range and the flicker is gone. With your 32"" G7 freesync range is even higher (80-240hz) so I assume LFC kicks in at 0-100fps, thats why 32"" owners used to report flickering even more than the 27"" owners!"
56484,"I set games to be at lowest 65, never seen any flickering. An hour ago was playing Cyberpunk with FPS average 80, lowest 1% 63, peaks at 90 (limited), didn’t see any flickering."
56485,"VRR Control off, correct ?"
56486,"Nope, VRR on. G77 32”"
56487,"VRR On fixes the broken LFC, but instead introduces judder in motion, when camera moves slowly is noticable, try to use a controler's analog to move the camera in a slow and steady speed, youll see the judder, then turn VRR off and try it again, judder is gone !"
56488,"I'd say there is no holy grail of monitors because a lot of monitors will check all the boxes, but then there is something that is missing.

I found the msi optix mag274qrf to be quite good, but it's a bit oversaturated and doesn't have srgb. Srgb isn't needed for me, but some want it.

Probably the lg 83 and 850 are the best of the best, but also don't have the best response times /input lag and only go to 144hz. Some may want 165hz or 240hz.

Monitors are all preference and you need to decide what you want in a monitor."

56491,"48C1, anyone?"
56492,I just want a 32 inch version of the GN950 with HDMI 2.1. That is it.
56493,"I tried both and like both equally, not sure which one I would choose.  I actually ended up going 4K 144hz and I’m really enjoying it."
56494,"4k 100hz+, with good HDR implementation (OLED or FALD) for $1000."
56495,Wait till May

56497,"2021 Samsung G7. It's going to be flat and, fingers crossed, it'll have MiniLED. It will be the god tier monitor for years to come."
56498,Is there an upgrade to the AW3418DW yet?
56499,"In the 16/9 département, the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX. It'll release this year after much delay, and will be $3000.
It will be the best of the best, yet still far from perfect."

48742,"Go with the [LG 27GL850-B](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850), it is by far the best monitor I've used in a long while."

48744,As opposed to outdoor gaming?
48745,"I mean a room with not enough lighting  
Edit: my room is not as bright"
48746,"Hey friend I know this is way late and you probably already have your monitor but usually dark rooms do fine because your monitor is its own light source. It may affect color but that can be adjusted. Usually you only have to worry about bright lights/natural light because they will be more or less ""fighting for your eyes bandwidth"" with the light your monitor puts out. Your eyes can only take in so much light signal and the more noise/light you don't care about seeing there is, the ""louder"" the light signals from your monitor need to be for them to look clear and nice. Hence why many movie/home theaters are very dark. Projectors work by needing to already bounce the image once off a surface, and you pretty much have twice the amount of noise to inter the image since its image is usually traveling twice as far before reaching your eyes"
48747,"No bro I havent yet thanks for the advice, I am still researching on monitors and I have even covered the back of my windows with a dark sheet so no light can come inside my room and inside the curtains are always closed. I have only two high end monitors available in my country 1) LG GL850 2) ASUS ROG XG279Q. Now I dont know which one to go for."
48750,"Spotted this while I'm checkin monitor shit again, since one of my 2 remaining 24in monitors died and am lookin to replace it with a *decent* 27in, that isn't quite as expensive as my LG 27GL850 I picked up months ago.

I *was* a bit skeptical/worried 'bout the 'screen bleed' myself when lookin into monitors, but at least compared to my old monitors, it's quite nice.

Apparently it's HDR is rather 'meh', but wasn't all that interested in HDR, and the brightness/colour quality is wonderful.

Can't really compare properly to other monitors I've not used myself, but it's rather highly-rated for a reason, and as you can see in the automod post, still a rather good 1440p, 144hz monitor.

To note, I've played a rather wide variety of games on the LG 27GL850 since I got it, including:

Fallout 4

Titanfall 2

Rimworld

War Thunder

Battletech

Space Engineers

56500,"Thanks for this! I went with the [LG 27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850), beautiful monitor."
56501,How noticeable is the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz? Also has anyone used the LG 23MP68VQ monitor?
56502,I've got an LG ultrawide @ 75hz. Just upgraded to actually run games at 75hz.  Definitely noticable and the price difference is usually negligable.
56503,"Edit: I don't mean to hijack this thread, just wanted to give my opinion.

Not enough to make it worth paying too much more, I have a 23 inch HP at 60hz and a same size 75hz Asus monitor, both at 1440p, I can't tell much of a difference if any between. Contrasting my 75hz monitor to my friends 144hz monitor shows the huge leap, I regret my choice for two and would happily go with one now and then another later."
56504,"I have a 75hz ultrawide. Here's an anecdotal opinion:

I play a lot of Siege. Sometimes when I run a Flash game, Siege will get messed up. This causes Siege to run at exactly 2 different speeds:57FPS, and 75FPS. I can tell you without question that I can tell exactly when my game is running at 57FPS. Absolutely infuriating. I've found I can make my game run at 75FPS by alt-tabbing out of Siege and then switching back in. I can also tell you that I've been killed a few times because I've been trying to get that sweet 75FPS back.

In my experience, the difference is extremely noticeable. My friends have noticed it was well."
56505,"Unless you're using Freesync or G-Sync, not reaching your monitor's refresh rate will always look stuttery because of the uneven frametimes. It's not entirely due to the lower average framerate compared to 75fps on a 75hz monitor.

Basically, when displaying 57 out of 75 frames, some have to be repeated. Because of this, every second you're seeing 39 frames once and 18 frames twice (39+18+18 = 75). Each of those 39 frames lasts 13.3 ms, while the other 18 last 26.6 ms.

On the other hand, with 60fps on a 60hz monitor each frame always lasts 16.6 ms (no stutter)."
56506,Just FYI you can overclock most 60 Hz monitors to 74~75. Even more if you're using DisplayPort instead of HDMI.
56507,"I switched from 60hz to 75hz, and I can really tell the difference between the 2. The 75hz feels smoother while surfing on the internet and stuff. In games, the the difference is very minimal, but still better than 60hz."
56508,"Really noticable, 75Hz is usable w/ very minor flicker but 60Hz flickers like hell."
56510,Can you link me the dell gsync monitor please? I'm new to this stuff.
56511,"[Most likely this one.](https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-s2716dg/apd/210-agjr/monitors-flat-screen-lcd-computer-displays)

I actually just picked one up myself for my GTX 1080 and I love it! Absolutely fantastic monitor. 

It's a TN panel which means relatively worse colours and viewing angle shenanigans, but the colours are still vastly improved over my previous monitors so I have zero complaints."
56512,"Try to wait for a sale if you're going to buy this monitor, as it goes on sale several times a year and can be had for as little as $350."
56513,"Do they have one of these in 1080p? I am looking for a good and affordable gaming monitor with gsync but I only want/need 1080. 

I have a 1070 Ti ftw2 so I mean should I consider just getting the 1440?"
56514,"1070 Ti is great at 1440p60 but you'll have to reduce some settings if you want frames up over the 100 mark. Lighter stuff like Overwatch and CSGO will have no issue though, my 1070 (non ti) was able to drive over 100 fps at ultra in OW at 1440p even in intense firefights

If maximum frames at all times is most important, go for a 144hz or even 240hz 1080p display. If you like crisp visuals and don't want to see pixels, I'd recommend grabbing the 1440p 24 inch Dell 144hz/G-sync unit when it goes on sale again. Check /r/buildapcsales frequently"
56515,"That sounds like the monitor for me! Thank you very much. I’m not sure I really need the 1440p, and I think I would value the seamless, higher frame & setting graphics more than the higher resolution."
56516,"It’s currently on sale at best buy for $380 actually. The 24” version was on sale at least last night for $350 on newegg. Keep in mind for the 27” you want the A07 or newer (preferably A09) revision to minimize the color branding issues this monitor had on the older revisions. I don’t know what revisions the 24” version is on currently but last I heard there was at least an A05 version.

56517,Hey man thanks for the link. I’m new to PC components and looking to get a PC soon. Would either the 24’ or 27’ work with a 580 4gb + i5 8400? I wouldn’t mind turning settings down but I’m thinking it might not be enough. I’d want at least 40 frames on most games
56518,"Well your limiting factor is going to be the 4gb vram on the gpu. If you do go for 1440p you will need to make sure to turn things that use high vram down such as textures. In terms of fps it really depends on the games you play. Do you play newer or older games? Newer games will push your gpu (and to a somewhat lesser extent cpu) quite a bit seeing as your gpu is made for 1080p gaming. Look up benchmarks for the 580 4gb (and see what cpu they are using for the benchmark to) and see what frames they get for the games they tested. If the frames achieved are what you desire then go for it. 
In the end though I will say 1080p 144hz unless you are trying to “futureproof” your monitor will probably be the way to go. But I don’t want to make the decision for you."
56520,Oops I forgot to take that in account in my response. Since he has amd freesync would be good. Gsync does add cost.
56522,"Don’t have a link but it’s the dell s2716dg. My friend just picked it up at Best Buy for $380. I own one personally and it’s very good, especially if you happen to buy the later revisions."
56524,How can you check which revision it is?
56525,"and what monitor if you can afford ips? Sorry, just started learning about monitors"
56527,Just make sure the Xb271hu is an ips monitor. They have two with similar names.
56528,HUA is TN.
56529,"I have a 1070 Ti (or might get the 1080), and want to ideally run games at 1080p 30FPS, and 720p 60FPS in order to be able to stream them. From what I can see online G-Sync monitors are way pricier than IPS's. What should I get and at what screen size? Is 23.8"" really that much worse at scaling than 24""?"
56531,"Since I'm on a budget though, and I'm used to running games with a 60FPS cap, I don't mind sacrificing smoothness with a cheaper monitor. Especially if it saves me $300. Do you think even in my case there's a reason to upscale?"
56533,I'm confused about what you mean here.
56534,he thinks it sucks a lot
56535,"Yeah it's pretty straightforward, if you can't afford £600 then get the Dell. I couldn't, so I did, and not disappointed. There's a reason it's popular."
56537,What's your recommendation for a 1080p 144hz monitor?
56538,ViewSonic XG2401
56539,"I got the AOC G2460PF for ~$200, and it was perfect for my intro to high refresh rate gaming.  Loved it so much that I just bought the Acer Predator XB272 (240Hz) last week for $400.  If you find yourself liking the 144Hz experience but don't feel the need to move up to 240Hz, you can upgrade to 1440p 165Hz after a while.

Just my personal opinion, but once I went 144Hz, I only wanted more."
56540,"120Hz CRT or Lightboost LCD is always going to be better, than 200+ Hz w/ high persistence though..."
56541,"Nah, once I saw how smooth 144Hz was, I only wanted more.  240Hz is as clear as panning over to something with your own eyes.  I absolutely love it so far."

NCX Talking about 1440p 144hz IPS G-Sync monitors - ViewSonic XG2703-GS, Acer XB271H, Asus PG279Q, AOC AG271QG:


The Viewsonic (best) has the best preset color accuracy, both it and the Acer offer superior 1080p scaling and 165hz overdrive performance, and both have less back-light bleed than the Asus which has the worst build quality despite being the most expensive.  They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is 
the winner of this very close race.


The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel (dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC's. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.

On why you shouldn't buy the Asus VG248QE:

It gets good reviews because it's not a bad monitor. Just a bad value for money. Most buyers don't know that, because the VG248QE is a popular and well-known monitor and comes up first in search results, and gets purchased by plenty of people without any knowledge of how it compares to the competition. Most of these people would be equally satisfied with any of these monitors, but all those reviews get credited to the VG248QE because it's the first result. Plus a lot of those reviews are from years ago when the choices of competing products was much different. There's no reason to keep buying the VG248QE today unless you don't know that other options exist.

What NCX says:

____________________________________________

NCX on the current breadth of budget 144hz options:

>There are 5 good budget options: The BenQ Zowie XL2411 ([back-light strobing](http://www.blurbusters.com/faq/motion-blur-reduction/)), LG 24GM79G (Free-Sync & strobing), MSI G24C (Free-Sync & VA panel), Samsung C24FG70/73 (Free-Sync, strobing and VA panel) and Viewsonic XG2401 (Free-Sync).  The rest of the tested budget options are significantly worse.

>The Viewsonic has the best image quality followed by the LG (switch gamma to 4) and BenQ which has terrible color presets but is ok once switched to the Standard Picture Mode, though neither the BenQ nor LG are as good as the Viewsonic out of the box. The Samsung (VA panel) easily has the best image quality of them all, but the worst overdrive since it suffers from green and purple overshoot ghosting during fast black, brown and grey transitions.  TN panels have dulled and vertically uneven colors (vertical gamma shift) and very restrictive viewing angles. 

>VA have more vibrant and even colors, tipple the contrast or 3 dark black depth and far less restrictive viewing angles than TN panels which allow them to be raised and viewed when leaning back while TN panels must be [viewed like this](https://support.hp.com/doc-images/470/c03093327.gif) to not look awful.  The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant (use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over-salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over-shoot ghosting.

____________________________________________

NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX:

The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401's according to PC Monitors.

The G2590PX's main issue (aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls (set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate (requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401's color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.

Copypasta from jaykresge:

I'll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/144hz monitors. Just note that while G-Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you're outside of the G-Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G-Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps (which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/GPU combo).

The Budget Option
Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG, depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality.These will typically run you in the $350-$450 range depending on sales.

The Quality Option
The ViewSonic XG2703-GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144-165hz AHVA (IPS-like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed (duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price - Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number (with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route.

This option will typically run you $600-$700.

Budget and Quality, but no G-Sync
Don't want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA (IPS-like)? Don't mind giving up G-Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It's basically the Freesync version of the XG2703-GS. MSRP is $400 for the model with basic tilt-only stand, and $500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $50 off MSRP."
56544,Did not know that. I updated the post and will update the wiki later when not on mobile.
56545,"Sure thing, decided to share my relevant copypastas as well in the edit."
56546,"Is this part from the archived guide still true? 

>	1080p 144Hz AHVA/IPS/PLS do not exist

I'm looking into getting a 1080p ips or VA with freesync. If 144Hz panels of that size/resolution are made, what's the highest refresh rates offered on that combo: 75Hz?"
56547,"AFAIK there are no 24"" 144hz 1080p IPS panels.

There are a few affordable 1080p 144hz VA panels.

It is assumed the budget VAs all use the same panel as the Samsung C24FG70/C24FG73, just without the quantum dot:

1. Acer ED242QR

2. MSI Optix G24C/Optix MAG24C(this version costs more because it has a better stand)

3. then of course there's the Samsung C24FG70/C24FG73."
56548,"Thanks for that! The last hour of reading other threads and some linked ncxmonitor guide helped me narrow it down to the samsung panel. I'll check out those first two you mentioned.

What're some of the differences between the 70 and 73? Aside from the base, it looks like the 70 has the ""interactive sound led lighting"" and the tilt is a little narrower 2°/17° vs the 3°/20° of the 73. Is that it?"
56549,AFAIK the 73 has a different stand. Never really looked into it.
56550,Here's a review of CFG73. He compares it to the CFG70 too : https://youtu.be/aRaI7EixodA
56551,"Nice, comprehensive guide."
56552,How will an i5 8600k and a 1060 I plan on overclocking do at 1080p 144hz
56553,"i5 8400 - 1060 6gb here

144hz is best upgrade ive ever made, got a viewsonic xg2401 (googled some colour settings to change (some dont love the colour on it)). you will have to turn down some settings in games, shadows and effects are usually what i turn down, but the most worth thing ive ever done.

also i never comment on reddit and this is how strong my opinion is"
56554,"In most modern AAA games, you'll probably get a solid 60fps at max settings. Lower them down a bit and you could reach 100fps or so (I'm guessing, you'll need to look at some benchmarks). It really depends on the games you play"
56555,My 1060 6gb hits 70-80fps in FC5 and PUBG with mostly max settings and I’m only on a 4670. I’m at like 175 average in rocket league too.
56556,"It won't push max frames on all ultra settings, but lowering some would help with a 1060 (6gb?) Guess would be 60-70+ FPS on high settings, 100+ with low/medium settings. If course it would depend on the game."
56557,"Can we also just take a moment to point out ""2k"" is not 1440p."
56558,"Did I make this mistake where? And if I didn't, I'd gladly add this to the guide."
56559,"No **you** didn't.  Sometimes people do, and Newegg lists 1440p monitors as ""2K"" as well, which doesn't help."
56560,"There comes a point where you just let it slide.  ""4k"" isnt actually 4k either. If you know what their intent is, then all is fine and dandy."
56561,"The problem is that there is a lot of inconsistency. Advertisers have decided that anything between 1080p and 4K can be labelled ""2K"". So you get 2560x1080, 2560x1440, and even some less common resolutions with the 2K label if you search Amazon. And technically speaking, 1080p is to actual 2K as 3840x2160 is to cinema 4K."
56562,What is 2k anyway? I recently say it on FNV's nexus modding pages for textures and I have no idea what it is
56563,"It's a cinema term for any resolution that's about 2000 pixels wide. In practice that almost always means 1080p.

edit: 2k textures would probably mean 2048x2048 resolution (of the texture, not the monitor)."
56564,"When people are talking about monitors they usually *mean* 1440p.  The ""k"" in 4K comes from the fact it is **3840**x2160 - the 3840 is about 4,000 so people say 4k. Also, 4k is 4x the resolution of 1080P so it makes more sense. 

Calling 1440p ""2k"" just doesn't fit the same guidelines, but that's usually what people mean"
56565,What is the difference?
56566,Yes. 2K ist actually 1080p.
56567,Can I do 1080p 144hz with a gtx 1060 6gb?
56568,"Yes and no. It's dependent on the game and your settings. 

Example:

Yes -  League of Legends maxed settings

No - Witcher 3 maxed setting"
56569,"Depends on the game pretty much. I get enough FPS to justify a 144hz with the games I play. I do have to turn down settings but the smoothness is worth it. I have a 780 GTX Ti 3GB, tend to bench mark similar to the 1060 I've found."
56570,"If you turn down the graphics settings to medium/low yes. 

This depends on the game. But if you're willing to sacrifice quality for refresh rate you can get 144hz out of a 1060

I can do a pretty much constant 120hz 1080p ultra on my 480 8gb card. I could go higher but I'd rather set a frame cap at 120hz and have a consistent frame rate over one that spikes and dips."
56571,"A GTX 1060 6GB should be fast enough for 1080p144hz in most games (albeit at lower settings), but your CPU also heavily matters for high refresh gaming. What CPU do you have?"
56572,so the 1060 6gb wouldnt be good for 1080p 144hz or is 1070 just the recommendation
56573,"I use a Rx 580 for 1080p 144hz.  It's fine for most games.  Just lower settings to high for most games or medium for brand new AAA games.

Although pretty much every monitor recommendation assumes max Ultra settings, it's much more reasonable to set graphics to high for higher framerates.  I don't know why the PC gaming crowd is so obsessed with Ultra settings."
56574,"> I don't know why the PC gaming crowd is so obsessed with Ultra settings.

Because that's where you can prove to yourself that the £800 gpu was money well spent over the £400 gpu. All the effects, all the time, which is where you can really make your gpu suffer."
56575,"yeah i dont really understand it so much either. 

I dont know if its just me but max settings on most games look horrendous. Especially in Fortnite"
56576,I just wonder one thing : I already have a gsync 24 inch 1080p AOC monitor. I want to buy a second one to watch movies surf etc. Would you rather go for a larger sized 4k monitor or another 1080p IPS/TN panel? What is your thought? Would it be a problem if one is 144 hz and the other is 60 or 75 hz?
56577,"Yes, I have had many issues mixing 144Hz with 60Hz.  If your 144Hz has G-Sync, it might not be an issue, but if you ever have any moving images on your 60Hz display while you're playing a game on your 144Hz display, it will probably stutter and/or cause frames to drop closer to 60Hz.

I used to watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. while playing games, but I had to stop when I got my 144Hz monitor.  Windows and Nvidia don't do a good job at functioning at different refresh rates simultaneously.  You can avoid this by putting a static image on the 60Hz display such as the desktop or the front page of Reddit.

My 144Hz monitor was the AOC G2460PF (no G-Sync), so you might be okay with the G-Sync variant, but just keep this stuff in mind when making your decision."
56578,This is what I am afraid of and there are conflicted thoughts everywhere on the internet.
56579,"If you're used to using one monitor already though, getting a second monitor isn't a bad idea for non-gaming uses.  If you're trying to watch content on the second monitor while you play games though, unfortunately it probably will cause problems.  If you have a place near you with a good return policy on monitors, or even a friend who can lend you a monitor, it wouldn't hurt to test it out on your system and see whether it causes issues or not.  Some people do say that their setup doesn't have any issues, but I think those people either don't recognize that their system actually does have problems, or maybe they're just super lucky."
56580,"You most likely want your highest refresh rate monitor to be the one you use for gaming. If you plan on upgrading your frequency, then you prob want to be looking for a new monitor to game on. The added refresh rate won't help for movies/videos.

Alternatively, a similarly sized 1440p ips monitor would look extra crispy. Or if you wanted more space, a 29"" widescreen is about the same height panel as a 23.6-24"" panel."
56581,No may be I didn't phrase it right. I will game on the monitor I already have. But would it be a problem if my other monitor's refresh rate is not same with the gaming one?
56582,"I have one 144hz and two 60hz and it work fine, sometimes my 144hz screen flashes and lag for a few seconds when alt-tabbing back in game but that might just be my monitor and it doesn't bother me much anyway."
56583,"Ah, my bad. But there shouldn't be any issues with that. I have a 165hz, 75hz, and 60hz all plugged into the same gpu, and all are different resolutions."
56584,"Have you had a two monitor system before? I am just asking because I didn't like having two monitors. Maybe because they were different models. But I ended up going with a 34"" ultrawide and love it."
56585,"Nice guide, thanks. You are making a great job to help us noobs!"
56586,"So I've got a pair of 1920x1200 IPS panels that are fine.  Is 1440 even going to be noticable?  I've got monitor envy and posts like this don't help.  Folks always talk about the 1080 step up, but I'm in the middle."
56587,"For me it was a noticable difference at 24"". Everything looks clearer for normal use and for gaming"
56588,"To be honest, at first, I didn't really notice the difference. But after using the monitor for a while and then looking at a 1080p monitor side by side, there is a noticeable difference."
56589,I had a 1080p monitor. 1440p is a huge difference even while just browsing the web.
56590,"Yes, i saw a Hp elite 27' 1400p monitor at a friend and it made me want to upgrade my Dell 2412h 1200p 24'. 

It's a very noticable upgrade. Personally now i see the screendoor effect at an arm's lengh viewing distance.

Testing a 4k+ 8k video on youtube made me open my mouth. (contrast made a big punch too) ."
56591,Which monitors do you have? I'm trying to narrow down my selection for my entry level monitor and am looking for 1080pish ips with freesync.
56592,"1080p 22"" to 1440p 27"" was a huge upgrade for me and 1080p 27"" monitors look terrible to me."
56593,Also note that LG has an ultrawide 4k monitor (the marketting bullcrap calls it 5k.)
56594,You forgot the best ratio and resolution. 21:9 at 3440x1440.
56595,Best aspect ratio and resolution and refresh rate is 32:9 at 3840 X 1080 at 144Hz
56596,What games do you play using that monitor?
56597,Most games. Only a few that do not support it like overwatch. They crop it instead of extending the picture.
56598,"Sorry, I was talking to /u/LordTwinkie . My bad."
56599,It's all good I forgive you.
56601,"When I purchased a 1440p 144hz monitor, I had a 1070 and 6600k and it ran things like a champ. The 8400 shouldn't bottleneck much now currently but potentially in the future if you keep the 1070. But, the bottlenecking is also very game dependent. For example, even with my 1080, my 6600k bottleneck so hard in BF1, but its only that game. I dont think you have much to worry about. You could always upgrade to the 11 series GPUs too when the come out, whenever that may be"
56602,It entirely depends on what you play / settings. Isn’t the dell 27” one on sale currently for like 470 at bestbuy?
56603,"For those of you with multiple monitors with different resolutions, there is a program that fixes the mismatch of the mouse position between the monitors, called LittleBigMouse. It's an open source project on github and It's especially useful in 1080p/4k setups to be able to more easily move the mouse between monitors without confusion. I use it with a 1440p/1080p setup and the mouse cursor lines up on both monitors smoothly and seamlessly.

The one recommendation I have is make sure to disable it any time you plan to change monitor resolution or position in the Windows settings and the re-enable it after because it can get a little screwy and lock your mouse cursor in a smaller area than it's supposed to if you're not careful."
56604,"Thank you, though not useful now, when I eventually get a new desk and can have both my monitors roughly level with eachother, this will be hugely helpful."
56605,Anyone know how to look for the best monitor for watching dark videos like movies or tv.
56606,"So I have a very old very top of the line 10 years ago gaming PC, and I'm usually fine with fps stutters between 25-60. I can play most modern games pretty okay. But I always play with anti aliasing. Now your post makes it seem like Anti  aliasing isn't actually that neccessary to make the game look prettier? Or is that specific to ultrawide 4k gaming, because you can't see the pixel anyways so you don't have to smooth them?



The card is a Radeon HD6950 btw, funfact it was the best card to mine bit coins when they were like a few cents a piece. I mined half and turned it off because I was afraid this card would die on me early. Still running like a beast to this day."
56607,"I only mentioned anti aliasing because the higher the resolution, the less jagged edges you are going to see. AA can have a large impact on performance, but I find I can turn it off or at least lower it without noticing a difference since I play at 1440p. At 4k, it'd be even less noticeable"
56608,Just get the PG279Q. It's badass. Love it.
56609,Can you elaborate more which ones you use?
56610,I have 2 monitors: Dell s2417dg and the Asus VN248HP. The first is a 1440p 165hz TN Gsync monitor and the other is a 1080p 60hz IPS. The Dell is my main monitor and the Asus is my secondary
56611,"Good guide. 

I miss the mention of Acer's XB241YU in the recommendations though. It uses the same panel as the Dell S2417DG but with some additional settings to tune the image and a few extra gimmicks (along with Acer's hideous design). Usually costs around the same.

I'd like to read a bit more about VA and the different kinds of VA and IPS if you're looking to improve your guide. Especially with the relatively cheap Samsung VA schon I feel this tech would deserve a bit more attention.

Anyways, thank you for the time and dedication that went into this. This is a good guide and will be helpful to many I suppose. Keep up the good work!"
56612,"I'm already at 1440p 90Hz IPS, but itching for an upgrade. I really want a 3440x1440 120Hz+ IPS G-sync, but can't justify the current cost of them. How big of an upgrade would going from 90Hz to 120Hz+ and getting G-sync and probably a higher quality panel in general be? (I currently have a very cheap Korean monitor from a few years ago.)"
56613,"Really awesome write-up guide!

For those with a tight budget, I just bought a 27"" Dell IPS 1080p@75Hz : 

[SE2717HR](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-se2717hr-27-ips-led-fhd-freesync-monitor-piano-black/5996200.p?skuId=5996200&cmp=RMX&extStoreId=224&ref=212&loc=DWA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPDaBRC6ARIsACAf4hDApQIPM8LD0HkvotS1CQg0ML37eiFyExiovtD2mbs6pEMwjabJj74aAnQeEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

$150 at Best Buy right now, best deal I could find by a long shot.

The picture is fantastic, pixel density be damned... Very happy with it. Sure it would have been nice to get a faster refresh rate or Gsync (got a 1070), but this sure is a nice placeholder!"
56614,"Whatever happened to LCD, LED, OLED, etc.? None of that is mentioned when shopping for monitors on pcpartpicker."
56615,"So out of all the 1440p, 27"" IPS G-Sync monitors out there, which one has the highest Adobe RGB color gamut, lowest amount of backlight bleed, and best customer service for replacements (in case of backlight bleed)?"
56616,Going to point out that generally an ultrawide display doesn't require a ton of extra horsepower. You probably won't have to drop any settings if you switch over from a 16:9 display.
56617,"Really? When I switched I had to upgrade my GPU to drive a 34"" 2560x1080 display."
56618,"Until the end of the year I want to pick one of those:   
* Dell S2716DG (TN)    
* ASUS PG279Q (IPS)     
* Dell Alienware AW3418DW (Ultrawide IPS, but ""only"" 120Hz)


Right now I'm using an old 1080p 60Hz 24"" TN Monitor (BenQ G2420HD), so any of the above will be a huge upgrade.     
I'm just not sure if IPS would be worth the extra money and Ultrawide seems tempting, but it's hard to tell if I would even like it.


Currently I'm playing mostly Rocket League, Dragonball FighterZ, Dota 2, Eternal and I'm looking forward to Monster Hunter World, but that would probably need a GPU upgrade immediately since I'm still on a GTX 580.


Any input will be appreciated :)"
