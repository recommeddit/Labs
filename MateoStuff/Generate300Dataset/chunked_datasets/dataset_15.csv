4823,">  The paint is comparable at both.

I have found Lowes/Sherwin-Williams partnership brand FAR superior to the reformulated HD Behr Paint.  Behr used to be terrific paint, but HD ruined it."
4824,"I just did the whole house in Behr Premium Plus Paint+Primer. Coverage was great, real pleasure to work with. I'm talking valspar vs. behr. The Sherwin-Williams is a whole other price point."
4825,"Home Depot, for 2 reasons:

1. Employees are way nicer, happier, and more knowledgeable

2. My car was keyed at Lowe's"
4826,"Home Depot usually gets the first nod from me because they're less than a mile away. Their garden section is pretty nice and their tool section is much more organized. 

Lowe's, on the other hand, is my go to place for price matching appliances, seasonal items and LED bulbs. I know they're not the best quality, but they have two-packs of 60w equivalent for $1.50."
4827,"I mostly use Lowes, if you have their credit card you get 5% off at the register and they are closer to my house, although I drive by both on my way home from work.  If I'm working on a bigger project I'll compare both based on price and what fixtures/finishes I like more.  Most projects end up being a combination of both as well as a few other sources.  

I used to use Menards mostly but prices got higher, and service got terrible."
4828,"I mostly stopped shopping at HD about 20 years ago.

Wife and I needed an over-the-range microwave. Went into HD, looked at all the displays, and found one we liked for like $225. Told the clerk we would take that one and he says it has to be ordered. I said fine, we weren't in a hurry. That is when he tells us there is a $75 delivery charge. I said that shipping to the store was fine, but he said the charge would be the same either way.

So, frustrated and not willing to pay an extra 33%... we ask which ones don't have to be shipped. He walks off to his terminal and looks around for 20 minutes only to come back and tell us that all of them do. 

So despite having an entire bank of displays, they don't have a single one they can sell without a $75 extra charge. We complained to the mgr to no avail and ended by telling them to fuck off.

We drove across the street to Lowes, picked one out. Clerk pulled it for us and loaded it right into our car.

I know it won't break them, but I would guess that $75 has cost them about $60k in the years since then (we do a lot of house work)."
4829,"Lowe's for me. Girlfriend works at Lowe's corporate, so any mention of the orange store is heresy. And I'm a veteran, and they give 10% off up to $500 per day for all active or prior military. 

I used to be a home depot guy, but the home depots here in Charlotte, especially up in concord where I live, are pretty shit since we're like 20 minutes away from Lowe's corporate."
4830,Lowe's has fucked me over on a few occasions with very simple customer service scenarios. Home Depot always treats me well. I avoid Lowe's at all costs
4831,Lowes only because of the $15 off $50 promo codes. PM me if you need some.
4832,"It depends on what Im getting. We bought our appliances at lowes but buy lumber at HD due to proximity and a lack of local yards. I shop the sales, though, and see no sense in megastore loyalty."
4833,Best time for large appliances is Thanksgiving and an even bigger discount on floor models.
4834,i'm more of a craft person but my SO has construction experience. lowes seems to be more homeowner friendly where as HD tends to be more contractor friendly. both are good but we usually end up at lowes. some brands are better at HD depending on what you need
4835,"Lowes.  Home Depot always has shit in the aisles.  Ladders, buckets of bullshit, gadgets I dont need, metal carts that should be in aisle 34, and that old guy that doesn't want to spring for the LED bulb."
4836,Lowes. Every HD near me restocks returned items without verifying all the parts are in the box. I've been screwed on everything from locks to ceiling fans to a god damn toilet.
4837,"In Alberta, Canada, my experience has been in favour of Home Depot. The staff is better trained/more experienced, and more attentive. Although Lowes has the price match +10%, they are very picky about giving it out, and it takes them half an hour to decide each time if they'll honour it. Although, one thing I want has been out of stock for months, and I see it's at Lowes in spades though."
4838,Home Depot for their customer service. I have had some really bad experiences with Lowes folks.
4839,"It's going to be a mix of both.  Overall, I find lighting to be better at Lowes than at HD.  Lumber is hit and miss depending upon the location"
4840,"Home depot has much better service and a superior website but lowes is closer so I buy there more often. Lowes staff is consistently shitty so in a way, they always live up to my expectations."
4841,"I have a Lowes and a Home Depot within a mile of each other, so I tend to go to both...but to be honest, I always to go HD first.  I couldn't say why, I just do.  My dog seems to like HD more."
4842,Lowes. You can buy coupons on ebay. Home depot not so much.
4843,"Don't get me wrong, I like Lowe's, they have certain advantages over Home Depot. Their staff is around to help more than HD, and they have a lot more stylish fans and lamps than HD (in my own opinion)

Where I lean towards Home Depot is 2 things - credit and contractors.

Home Depot credit card (Citibank) seems to understand that if you're looking for a home improvement card you need a large credit limit. I've done some larger jobs with Home Depot that we're 15k+ and HD Citibank had no issue extending my credit line to 30k so my credit line doesn't look like I maxed the card out (and hoping I spend 30k ;)) 

Also, 24 months interest free is a good deal for large projects since I always pay it off before interest gets accrued.

Lowe's credit (Synchrony bank) maxed me out at 8k credit limit, and refused to extend even though my income and credit scores allowed for 30+k credit limits elsewhere. They do no interest or 5% off the order, but that means nothing if you can't do a large project on it.

Finally, there is contractors. I've only had flooring installed from both companies. HD assigned it to a specific contractor, which were amazing. Showed up on time every day, got the job done right, same crew every day. No bullshit.

Lowe's had 3 contractors show up at my house in the 3 days the job was going on, each not sharing what they did the previous day so I had to re-explain certain things about the job multiple times. Was not pleased with that at all."
4844,"I like Lowes more, but I live equidistant between the two. Home projects usually take a few trips to the hardware store, so I alternate."
4845,"Home Depot. It's closer to my house by 2 miles. And I'm just so familiar with the layout I can navigate that place really quick.  Their prices are so similar it's almost like Coke and Pepsi. Pick one and stick with it.   
  
Worth mentioning: most of the stuff they sell at either place is pretty crappy quality. If you want nice stuff go to places that specialize in it. Lumber / trim / doors: go to a lumberyard. Plumbing fixtures: plumbing supplier. Lighting: chandelier store. Etc. you get the idea. These options cost more but you get what you pay for.  
  
If you have to build something that you want nice and square for gods sake don't by 2x4s at HD or Lowes."
4846,"As an IT contractor I can tell you that Lowes is in a constant struggle to match what HD is doing. As such I tend to only shop at HD. Much like I prefer Mac over HP PC's.

HD seems to have the better leadership and I tend to trust their quality of products. That said HD sells Ryobi products which are complete crap.

I go to Harbor Freight for 1 off tools. I apply the same philosophy to HD vs. Lowes. If I need good product; HD, if I need weather stripping or some stone, Lowes; something they can't mess up."
4847,"it's kind of like target vs. walmart (I defer to target a lot but I visit *both*.. I like walmart's saving catcher)

walmart/home depot is always the cheapest.. (sort of) but regardless of higher prices.. lowes there's some hidden values to lowes that I Don't care to elaborate on.. (I'd love to tell you about all the free/hidden value I got from lowes but I can't.. ""information is power"" n' all that that and also because of this.. I've gotten some bad customer service on a few occasions.. but you take the good with the bad..cause it's **90%** *good*) it'd be nice if any store would have these ""new app"" controlled motorized blinds that are supposed to be available but there not yet.

menards is pretty neat.. they just opened 3-4 stores here..but they're all still too far away...

Also when it comes to nearest home depot or lowes.. basically lowes is closer and faster to me to get too.. they are on the highway.. and HD is farther or in the middle of the inner city meaning ""no highway"" access.."
4848,"I can't speak for all Lowe's locations, but the one local to me in Pittsburgh is my go to if I'm doing a project that I've never tackled before. The folks they have there walk me through without having me spend a ton of extra money. 

If it's a project I've done before and know what I need, I hit my local Home Depot. I'm a huge DIY-er, so I know my way around both stores."
4849,Lowes because there are few employees to bother me and I know what I want and where it is.
4850,"In Colorado, there seems to be a big difference in the number of employees on the floor helping customers. In Home Depot, I get people asking me if they can help me find something, which is awesome. At Lowes, I literally (yes, literally) have to sometimes walk through the entire store to find the one damn person that I can ask a question of, but of course there's already 4 other people there waiting to ask them a question."
4851,"For appliances Lowes or Sears
For everything else Menards"
4852,"I usually shop at Home Depot as it's closer to my house, doesn't require me to travel on a highway to get there, and has probably 90% of what I need.

I shop at Lowe's when Home Depot doesn't have what I need. Most recently this meant baseboard heater covers, but it also usually means decorative stuff; Lowe's typically has a more upscale selection of ceiling fans, lights, cabinet hardware, etc.

IMO, Lowe's is better, or at least more logically, organized. More than once have I gone to Home Depot to look for something which *obviously* should be in (for example) the hardware aisle, only to discover that, no, it's actually in the aisle with the mailboxes, or with the doors, or whatever. I almost never get that when I go to Lowe's; more often than not when I expect to find something in a certain aisle at Lowe's, it's right where I expect it to be."
43914,.
4854,"My list of preference for stores.  

1.  Harbor Freight for disposables, one-off items, most hand tools unless I'm going HIGH end.  (Their stuff is about Stanley grade, sometimes better.  But it's substantially below pro level). 

2. Menards except for plumbing.  

3. Ace for Hardware (and strangely they have the best Christmas lights, even better than Target).

4. An actual lumber yard for any furniture grade lumber.

5. An actual plumber's supply store for plumbing.

6. Amazon.com (nice tools, some hard to find items)

7. Home Depot or Lowes, whichever actually has the items I need. Like, strangely, Home Depot HQ refuses to stock rounded baseboard molding caps, even though every house in the region is made with rounded corners (adobe looking style southwestern houses).  Even the Home Depot staff are upset about that...

For appliances, you should try and wait until September when they're 40-50% off.  Appliances have an insane markup (about 70%) and are built like garbage these days (last about 7 years)."
4856,"I second this. If you actually need to talk to someone who has at least the slightest knowledge about hardware store stuff, Ace is 100x better than big box. At mine they actively greet everyone who enters and ask what they can help with. I’m usually in and out of there in a fraction of the time vs. HD wandering all over the place either trying to find stuff or trying to find someone who is willing to help me with a question."
4857,The HD or Lowe’s app is great for reducing the wandering around time.
4858,"That takes away all of the fun in going to a hardware store, turning a 5 minute trip into and hour looking at the new tools you don’t actually need."
4859,Yeah I thought this was supposed to be how you shop at Home Depot?
4860,Jokes on me...I dont even own a home. But there I am wondering aimlessly around HD wamting to buy everything.
67841,Ok
4863,"Yeah, this is what my plumber said too.  If you can fix it, home depot.  If you need help, ACE is better."
4864,"Ok I thought it was just me, but it's almost impossible to get an employees help at HD or Lowes, and even when you do, you get the feeling that they are just waiting for the convo to end because they are so busy!

Local shops may be the best option"
4865,"Asking for an opinion for home stuff at a big box home improvement store is like asking for an opinion about a top of the line television at Walmart. 

The associates are largely clueless about their products and applications. This isn’t a fault of the associates, rather the company that employs them. You can’t expect expert advice from employees that are earning shit wages."
4866,"It's more on things like getting lumber cut when they're even slightly busy.    


I said fuck it and bought a circular saw for a fence repair project recently and now I don't have to waste my time trying to track down the mysterious solo employee who is responsible for doing cuts."
4867,So their upsell plan worked. Lol
4868,"Hah, I guess it did.  It was mostly because I had to rebuild a 25 foot fence section, and part of it had a big phone junction box right down the middle of the property line, so I had to cut the pickets to fit around it."
4869,"Very true, I’m sure they are very overworked too"
4870,I love my ACE!
4871,"I always check Ace Hardware first, I have been an Ace fan for many years and always go there, they always treat me right and have time to answer my questions."
4872,"I agree with this so much. my local ace is great. 

Also on another topic with my local ace, they stock a specific local lawn care product line. A few times a year they have a rep from the company come and  answer questions. It's awesome."
4873,Ace also fixes screen windows on the cheaper side. That and key cutting are their best services.
4874,"I saved this post because it has a ton of websites for all sorts of stuff. The entire thread is good, this post is a list of many of the suggestions from the thread.

https://old.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/e24whu/best_little_known_websites_for_purchasing_home/f8tpxzc/?context=3"
4875,"thank you, I'll take a look"
4876,"Home Depot. I'm in between a Lowe's and a home Depot but I find home Depot has a better selection. Not sure if you're near an Ace Hardware, but we have them where I live. The people there are nice but the prices can be significantly more than home Depot for the same thing."
4877,I never find what I’m looking for in HD. They always have the more expensive version of what I’m looking for.   It pisses me off. For this reason alone I stopped going to HD.
4878,That's unfortunate. Where do you prefer going instead?
4879,Lowes and for tools Harbor Freight (except battery tools)
4880,the one closest to my house
4881,"As a homeowner, and also a contractor, Home Depot. I find myself constantly frustrated at Lowes because they always seem to be out of stock on very basic, very common items (mostly electrical and plumbing fittings), and their online inventory is hit or miss.

Ace/True Value can be good for oddball fasteners and hardware, but their prices are usually significantly higher on most items.

A supply house or lumber yard can be the best bet depending on what you're doing. Higher quality materials and generally knowledgeable employees at a slightly higher cost."
4882,"Home Depot, I've always liked their selection. Lumber sucks but I do like their other stuff."
4883,I was surprised with the bathroom remodeling options when I was there yesterday. I wanted everything in that aisle haha. Controlling my spending over the next month is going to be a struggle!
4884,"Near me it’s the opposite. Home Depot has far better plywood sheet options than Lowe’s for cheaper. 
2x wood is about the same quality and price at both."
4885,"Ace for little things, Lowe’s for big things. Sometimes Menards. Home Depot only as a last resort because 1) it is hardest to get to despite being closer than Menards and 2) getting anyone to help requires an act of God."
4886,"> 2) getting anyone to help requires an act of God

Yes! I feel like when I finally do get help, I am wasting their time"
4887,I’d say it’s about 50/50 in my experience and there is absolutely no middle ground.  You either find someone who is above-and-beyond helpful or you end up with someone who wishes they could will you out of existence.
4888,Just today I asked where an item would be located and the employee told me aisle 6 in the garden center and I had to ask a second person where aisle six was. It didn't exist! Second guy was very helpful.
4889,"Binford.

but in all seriousness, I try to follow pricing and focus on brand of what I'm getting > brand of store."
4890,"I live very close to an ACE hardware. I LOVE my local ACE, and they’re very helpful, knowledgeable, and have great customer service.

I wish I could get everything I need at Ace, but their stock is limited and sometimes too specific for what I am looking for. 

My local Lowe’s is great for the gardening section. My local Home Depot is great for anything else that Ace doesn’t have."
4891,Restore!
4892,"Had to scroll way too far for this. Can’t recommend it enough, please check to see if your local Habitat for Humanity runs a Re-Store.

The stock is often brand new equipment and supplies donated by local builders or leftover from home builds, and lots of random donated furniture and housewares. Unpredictable but you can find some real gems, the last pleasant thrifting experience."
4893,"Home Depot for replacements (Appliances, lighting, faucets, carpeting, etc).

Ace for repairs, service (screens) and paint (Clark-Kensington)."
4894,"We go to Lowe's, probably only because they are closest to our house. And also they have a military/ veteran's discount everyday."
4895,"Got it, yes Lowe’s had some nice flooring when I visited the other week. Still think I will go with an online retailer since I loved the samples they sent me, but Lowe’s had a really good selection."
4896,I use Lowe’s over Home Depot because of the app for the military discount. HD offers it revert day here too but you have to prove it every time. Lowe’s just scans my phone and boom!  Discount.
4897,Lowes also sells open box or discounted items. HD doesn't do that unless they've changed the policy recently.
4898,"Grainger, hands down.  Since they’ve stopped only selling wholesale, I’ve gotten so much stuff there.  Their catalogue is huge and turnaround on orders is quick."
4899,"I love them too, but dang, theyre automatically more expensive than anywhere else."
4900,"If you're going to Grainger, check out McMaster Carr. Get your costs back down and their delivery time is incredible."
4901,Lowe's for plumbing parts and lights.  Home depot for pretty much everything else. I prefer hd paint by a large margin as well as their electrical. I also like ace hardware a lot. If it matters I've been shopping in one of those stores a minimum of once a week for the last 20 years.
4902,"I go to the nearby Ace for most things. There is a Sutherlands around he corner from that if they don’t have what I need.  For carpentry/building/ larger projects, we have a Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menards all within a mile of each other. So whichever one’s website says they have what I need for the price. 

Harbor Freight for many tools and odd hardware. 

Oh and the local farm supply for some things.

Wow, I go to a lot of different places. Mostly Ace."
4903,Home depot. My wonderful girlfriend prefers Lowe's. One day it will end our relationship.
4904,What an interesting debate.  I can see how this would be a relationship ender.
4905,Do you have experience?
4906,"Actually yes. You see my significant other is unreasonable when it comes to home improvement stores. We debate on this topic at great length, but alas we have not yet come to agreement. It might end up being a deal breaker for sure. How do you resolve these issues?"
4907,"Are you serious? I mean I was kidding but, are you serious?!? Are you team home depot because that's the solution right there. Dump him for being Lowe's."
4908,"Sorry I'm on your girl's team, man. LOWE'S FOREVER!"
4909,Huh. Unexpected. Could I convince you otherwise? I mean maybe your man just isn't getting it done for you. Convincing you HD is better I mean.
4910,I mean he hasn't convinced me so I don't know why you think you could do any better.
4911,You say that but you're still responding instead of ignoring me. Sounds like you're curious how I **could** convince you.
4912,I mean I'm willing to listen to your position. Bu you should be prepared to not win this one. I'm quite loyal to Lowe's.
4913,"Lowe's, I worked for Home Depot for a summer before quitting and taking a better job elsewhere and it was probably one of my top 3 worst places to have ever been employed, literally was written up for failing to have a positive enough attitude because and I'm quoting verbatim here "" I didn't smile enough "" I started job hunting immediately after that first one and it was such a pleasure to give them one shifts notice ( that's their own policy you only have to give a minimum of one shifts notice) that I was quitting."
4914,"I work for a Home Depot DC,  and it's one of the best jobs I've had. You probably had a shitty GM."
4915,"Don't doubt it, I know not all stores are badly managed and a lot of people love working there but my experience jaded me and turned me off from shopping there."
4916,"None of that has anything to do with the products they offer.  I'm sorry you had a bad employment experience there, but that doesn't answer the question asked in any way.

To OP: I find that Home Depot has a better selection.  In my experience, prices between the two are basically equal, so you're going going to save much by choosing one over the other.  I would just go with the one that carries more of what I'm looking for."
4917,"He asked what our choices was and why, I stated mine and why, and from what I've seen none of them have better choices over the other, it's all the same stuff under different brand names."
4918,"Dunn Lumber for quality wood. Ace for small items I need right away since it's closest to me and locally owned-ish. HD for whenever I want more options, plus it's generally cheaper the the two mentioned before. Lowe's if they have a specific on sale or the HD is too busy. Harbor Freight for super simple tools for the lowest price available."
4919,"Lowe’s, Ace, and local lumber mill."
4920,"Lowe's. I live in a smallish town outside of a larger city. Lowe's is the only home improvement store in town. There's a Menards about 15 minutes down the road on the outskirts of the larger city but it's a fucking hassle to find anything there. Even using their app to find a single specific item and clicking on the maps the thing is like ""well that item could be in one of these eight places around the store."" Really? I just redid my master bathroom and got maybe 3 small things there I couldn't find at Lowe's. Their vanity selection was actually pretty poor (everything was super expensive and I couldn't find any major quality differences from the ones at Lowe's). Home depot is a half hour away in the middle of the city and I'm not dealing with traffic and an hour commute unless I need something today that Lowe's and menards both don't have. I don't even try going to Ace. It's in the middle of the city right near a massive Bass Pro and I'm down to deal with that shit less than Home Depot."
4921,"Home Depot for most general things like bolts, screws, cheap tile, etc. I go to True Value or the lumber yard near my house for wood & tools because of the quality & knowledge of the staff and the fact that both are locally owned is awesome too"
4922,I go to Lowe’s but only because they are the closest to me and they give a military discount.
4923,Ace Hardware. I don't know anything and find the huge stores overwhelming. A smaller store with more personalized service and knowledgeable associates is exactly what I need when buying stuff for a project. Everything I've done in our house is the first time I've ever done it.
4924,Lowes. They have a wider variety of bath fixtures and most other upgrades. YMMV. Home depot has way better plants and outdoor improvements.
4925,"In the past, I used Amazon.  I would just plug in what I needed, and go for their top-seller.  This is good for new cash-strapped homeowners, but it’s usually a cheaper-quality item.

Now, I use consumer reports to find the item I want, and then I use price comparison sites to search for the best price."
4926,"Lowe's, our local store allows animals on leashes. My well behaved German Shepherd and I have spent some quality bonding time there"
4927,"Lowes, always"
4929,I loved menards. Until I found out how terrible their owner was and I won’t return
4930,How is the owner terrible?
4931,https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2013/06/20/murphys-law-the-strange-life-of-john-menard/
4932,Ames got a Menards last year and I haven’t been in Lowe’s since.
4933,Tbf that Lowe's has always sorta sucked. It's small and always seemed to be out of stock of the one thing you went there for in the first place
4934,My father in law said the same thing when it opened.
4935,"I prefer my local shop, Harville Hardware, if I'm looking to buy a quality piece of equipment. If I need something for a quick repair, ACE Hardware. If I need general construction stuff that ACE doesn't carry, Home Depot. If I'm looking for finish grade stuff, Lowes."
4936,I'm partial to home depot for most things.  Lowes seemed to have a better selection of lighting.  Flooring came from a flooring liquidation store.
4937,I like McLendon's hardware rather than Home Depot because the staff in each area actually know their stuff and are very helpful even with my terrible descriptions and photos of things. They are also kind and patient. It's like an old school hardware store.
4938,"I'm not a fan of Lowe's, but it's less than a mile from home. 2 traffic lights and I have what I need.  The lumber is almost always warped and knotty (I think it sits outside, I've got wood off the shelf and it's been wet or frozen depending on time if year). If I need something nice or quality, I'll make the half hour drive to home Depot. It's one of the big ones, everything is always in stock and the lumber is decent, I think they store theirs indoors before it hits the shelves."
4939,"I don't have just one.  Walmart, Amazon, and Home Depot are where I end up getting most things.  I like to shop around and get the best deal between them.  Sometime I'll even do a mix of them for a project. Home Depots curbside pickup and Walmart's similar program are just so efficient lately as I don't want to be wandering around a store where over 50% of people aren't using masks.  I used to use Ace Hardware, but their pricing, selection, and staff just aren't what they used to be 10+ years ago.  I'm sure this varies from area to area though.  Ace also has a really poor online site that's totally unreliable and they've set me back a few times not having things a week after they were supposed to have them.  

I have an aunt who loves Wayfair and boasts about how she gets lots of free items (they send a replacement and she gets to keep the defective version), but she also spends large amounts of time arguing with customer service.  My takeaway is that Wayfair can be great if you are willing to deal with customer service, but if you dread it like me might be a site to avoid."
4940,"Thanks, yes I need to take advantage of the curb side pickup. Only thing is I kind of like to see and feel what I’m buying, so I usually end up going in the store anyway 

That’s why I’m a little hesitant to order from someone like wayfair for big purchases."
4941,"I once heard on reddit “Home Depot to build a home, Lowe’s to finish a home”. I find this to be very true. Home Depot has all the functional bits all the time. Lowe’s however has much better choices when it comes to the aesthetics, their lighting aisle for example blows HD out of the water."
4942,"Wow I’m going to remember this, thanks! Makes sense as to why Lowe’s had superior flooring options imo"
4944,"Ace. They are 5 minutes fromMy house vs 15 for the big box stores.  Plus there's always someone to ask and the store is small, I don't spend a long time wandering. Selection isn't as great as the big box but I'll support them to keep em open and close by"
4945,"Lowes for slightly lower prices when quality doesn't matter, Ace when I want the good stuff and advice from people who know what they're talking about. I'll avaid Home Depot as much as I can."
4946,"Menards requires masks. Until COVID has a vaccine, it's the place for me."
4947,"Well in the south there’s only two places to go, Lowe’s and Home Depot and both kinda suck. Once I went to a place called Menards up north and that’s how I found out you can actually buy wood that’s not pine. Didn’t even know you could do that. All this time I thought you had to mill your own hardwood. But then again the south sucks for everything so not surprised"
4948,"I can not recommend going outside of big box stores when buying stuff. Same faucet, cheaper price. On a budget ? I get buying it. Been there ."
4949,"I used Home Depot, Lowes, HD Supply, Build.com, Ashley furniture, Costco, Ace Hardware, Walmart, Target, and Macy's. 

Build.com has excellent phone support. I got my two chandeliers, and all my cabinets handles and pulls there with free shipping.

Macy's has a wonderful furniture sale annually. 

Good luck."
4950,"Luckily I have Menards and Lowes 15 minutes away.  BTW Lowes will honor Menards 11% off sales, so will Home Depot.  For little stuff, I go to a Farm and Fleet, 3 minutes away.   Other times I will order off of Amazon if the pricing is better."
4951,"Im surprised menards is not a preferred store for everyone. Menards has better pricing than Home Depot and Lowe’s and better selections. I go to HD because i have one really close but if i need a better selection, always menards. 

I have to start experiencing ace hardware more but don’t have one too close. And Lowe’s is overpriced and far!"
4952,"[Knowing that Home Depot supports the reelection of Donald Trump, I don't spend a dime there.](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740173176/home-depot-responds-to-calls-for-boycott-over-co-founders-support-for-trump)"
4953,We always go with Lowe’s. Husband gets a military discount there.
4954,"Wayfair service is complete shit. I ordered a $1,000 table. Got half of it (the top and legs, none of the metal infrastructure that holds it together—different box). Called and told them. 

They shipped me the same fucking half I already had.

Called them and told them.

They shipped me the other half and did not pick up the other half.

Called them. They asked me to dispose of the table myself. The multi-hundred pound table in my small (lovingly cared-for, not cheap) car.

Like two *months* after this started, they finally had someone go there to pick it up. They basically took the desk and left all the fucking packing materials on my front porch. Literally opened the box, took the table, left everything else.

Holy fuckballs is Wayfair terrible."
4955,Holy shit that sounds like a nightmare! It stinks because they have some (seemingly) nice wooden coffee tables that I planned on ordering. Also deck furniture looks really nice too
4956,"I'm currently boycotting my local Lowe's since they mismanaged the installation of a replacement front door and garage door and delayed it by several months. It was about 2 years ago and I'm still salty.

Going to Home Depot instead is easy since they're typically across the street from Lowe's anyway, at least around here."
4957,"Hd, never like Lowe’s or ace"
4958,Menards is my number one for most things. Ace is a second since they are usually closer.
4959,"Much of the time I go to my Lowe’s they are out of stock of the same items they have been out of stock for the last 8 months. (Like, do they ever take inventory?) Also the lumber is crap there, it’s like they never cull any of the picked through crappy lumber and just hope some unexpecting person will eventually buy it. At Home Depot I find what I need generally and the lumber is much better."
4960,">What is your go-to store for home improvement items
 
The one with the lowest prices always. 
 
Brand loyalty is something for wealthy people. My wallet doesn't allow me to stick to favorites."
4961,Victoria’s Secret
4962,I think a lot of it—at least the customer service aspect—depends on your local store.
4963,"Exactly. My Lowe’s by me has terrible customer service, which stinks because they are so much closer than Home Depot"
4964,Hard to find someone to help or find someone that actually knows anything ?
72787,Yes
4966,When “yes” is both a meme and the correct response.
4967,well bruh...why you asking lowes employees about your projects when you have the expertise of anonymous Reddit users right on your phone?
4968,"Anonymous reddit users are like the 1000 monkeys situation. If I read enough people argue about a topic I'll have a decent idea of what I should do. Up to and including ""you should just find an expert for this problem"""
4969,"I used to work for Lowe’s for 10 years till this past January as a millwork specialist. Lowe’s does not care who they hire. I can swear to you the only hire people to fill in for coverage. You might have a few good full timers but half the departments will be empty staffed or being covered by a kid who’s in lumber and also covering millwork and hardware at the same time, who’s being payed probably 12-13$ a hour."
4970,"I normally go to Lowes, but I might start going to Home Depot, even though I realize this may have happened at both. Lowes shows that they have fireplace screens available in store and the number and items increased in a few days. I ordered one because  the second we're not looking, my puppy is running and jumping into the fireplace and trying to eat the fire stones and fake gas wood. The outside of the fireplace has granite on the bottom, so if I use a baby gate and he knocks it over, it might damage the granite. If I use cardboard, he'll destroy it or just move it. 

So I ordered one online and selected pickup order. I get there, and ask who can help me, and they literally tell me they can't because it's a seasonal item. They also want $20 to ship it. 

I normally prefer to go to that Lowes, because if I go to the slightly farther away Home Depot, there's usually people out there begging for money."
4971,"This is my exact situation. I literally drive past Lowe’s on my way to Home Depot. Every now and again I just stop at Lowe’s for convenience, but I almost always regret the decision, and half the time wind up at Home Depot eventually anyways."
4972,"Huh, that's the opposite for me. It's like pulling teeth trying to speak to the right department employee at home depot but everytime we go to Lowe's, employees are always asking if you need help and have never had issues. Definitely location dependent."
4973,Ditto. Lowe's is more convenient and there's always employees around. In fact I was looking for the right lightbulb for a low key photo project and started talking to an employee about it after he asked. I then had to figure out how to end our 20min discussion of color temperature and Kelvin ratings cuz I had to pee. He was very enthusiastic. 9/10 customer service only because at a certain point he should have cared less.
4974,"I don't doubt that. 

The manager of the Home Depot store near me does a great job running his store, while Lowes seems like they just hired kids away from McDonald's, who have never held a hammer in their life. It's usually a waste of time for me to ask for help at my Lowe's store."
4975,It's more helpful to Google the item and the store that you are at and find the isle and bay location listed with the item as opposed to asking someone
4976,I do this at Walmart. They had changed so many aisles this past year. The app tells me the location.
4977,I swear they do that purpose so you have to spend more time in the store.
4978,"Same! We have several home improvement projects going on and go to Lowe's right up the street often, but with more time on hand we've been making the 20 min. trip to HD because it's so much better. At Lowe's last week I heard a customer ask an employee, ""Excuse me, do you know where the [insert items] are?"" The guy just said, ""No, I don't"" without slowing down or offering to look it up. Surprised there was even an employee to be seen other than the check-out folks...anyway."
4979,I must be lucky. Where i live lowes and home depot are 30 minutes from my house and they are literally right across the street from each other. Ive gotten good and bad service from both though so now I go to the one thats gonna have the brand im looking for.
4980,"Wait, there's a Lowe's in existence that doesn't have a Home Depot across the street?"
12153,Yes!
4982,Mine doesn't. No Home Depot in my city.
4983,I’m in the same boat
4984,You would think. But how come Trader Joe’s and chick fil a consistently have great people across all the locations nationwide? Seriously I don’t know how but there has to be some aspect of Managment that influences this more than the other company
4985,"Those two companies seem to treat their employees really well and pay better than most.  Trader Joe's has minuscule turnover rates....to work in a grocery store.  I know someone that left a decent career to go work for one with eyes on management in the future.  I don't know about CFA, but a local chain, In&Out  Burger has a similar thing with employees.  Pay them above normal, good/great benefits, and they can pick and choose who they hire."
4986,"I think lowes is getting closer to that then depot. The 4 lowes in my county are consistent, while the depots are falling off. I used to see them equal but lowes is pulling ahead."
4987,"I had to get a new sliding screen door yesterday. I went to HD first because it's closer. The screen doors they had in stock were all broken and out of the packaging. I went to lowes and they were all new and unbroken. I couldn't find anyone at HD to help me but I found someone in Lowes in the door section. I normally like HD better for the types of things I buy but you're right HD is starting to fall off at least in my area. I have 2 HD's close to me. One of them I won't go to after a bad experience and the ""good"" one is starting to get bad. 

The one I won't go to I bought a water heater from and when I got home and opened the box it was a used hot water heater all rusted and falling apart. Someone had returned it and they never checked the box. So I had to lug it all the way back and get another brand I didn't really want but it was all they had."
4988,"I go to Home Depot for building materials and Lowe’s for fixtures. HD has typically better selection of building materials, but Lowe’s has more on trend decorative items like light fixtures, planters, etc."
4989,My exact feelings. Lowes went hard on their HGTV partnership.
4990,How is the Lowe's Sherwin Williams hgtv paint?
4991,Not very good. I wouldn’t use it for anything other than trim.
4992,"Agreed. My dad is a builder and only goes to Home Depot, because they always have exact kind of materials he wants. I am *not* a builder, and I usually like Lowe’s because the things they sell are closer to finished products than materials."
4993,This was going to be my comment. HD for building and Lowe's or specialty for finishes.
4994,"I agree. Lowe’s is great for faucets, lighting, doorknobs, etc. More displays, broader products, and the like. 

HD is better for when I’m actually building stuff, framing, roofing, etc.

In the pandemic world, however, I feel safer at Lowe’s, given their cleaning protocols, although their huge in-store only sale a week or so into this seemed a little ignorant of the moment’s severity."
4995,"If anything with the pandemic I prefer Home Depot. They actually limit how many people are in the stores and the last couple times I’ve ran to Lowe’s I couldn’t even find a parking spot. I prefer Lowe’s for almost everything, lumber I’ll get at an actual lumber yard tho because both stores tend to have crap lumber"
4996,"Man, we've been going to Lowe's because even without occupant limiting it's empty.

Oddly for us, the Depot has a better selection of everything, but if I can't find something there there's a good chance Lowe's has it. It's like Lowe's looked at Home Depot's inventory and said ""stock all the normal stuff, and then stock all the slightly-off sizes of everything that Home Depot doesn't have."""
4997,"Fair enough. I do appreciate that HD throttles traffic into stores, which Lowe’s doesn’t.

Debating ‘Top Places to Shop During a Global Pandemic’ isn’t what I expected for the year. 

But, local everything, lumber yards (you’re right they’re better), and anything that helps people around me stay employed. I’m lucky to be, still."
4998,">Lowe’s has more on trend decorative items like light fixtures

Hey, you can't beat Menards large selection of what can only be described as mobile home lightning from the 1980s."
4999,Can add to this...all base materials bought at HD or Menard's...finishing fixtures at Lowes. But generally the Lowes by me is a wasteland.
5000,"Agree. I prefer my Lowe’s to Hd because it’s less crowded and cleaner with a better staff, but that’s just the case for my neighborhood."
5001,"Also, Home Depot > Lowe's for tools. With a few rare exceptions. But Lowe's > Home Depot for outdoor furniture."
5002,"Same here.  HD carries maple lumber and generally better kiln dried dimensional lumber.  I found that they have a better selection of tools.  Lowes carries a lot of designer lightning fixtures, ceiling fans, and faucets.  Also found that they carry better paint supplies and accessories."
5003,"HD loaned me $1k in materials for my eagle scout project after Lowe's laughed at me. 10 years later, I enjoy spending my shittons of money at HD now.

Edit: gifted $1k in materials."
5004,"That's pretty cool. 

When you say materials that makes me think lumber and paint, rather than tools. I'm envisioning you returning a wood park bench or something.

What did they loan you?"
5005,"Yes, it was paint & primer and painting tools, and then a ton of these brackets that I needed for the installation of a chain link fence."
5006,"Now when you say “loaned”, I guess that means you later paid for them?"
5007,It was goodwill. I don't know why I said loaned now.
5008,"They probably did it as part of their ""Team Depot Inititave."" Each store usually does like 2-4 volunteer projects per year."
5009,"Ah, cool, cool. Was just wondering. Peace."
5010,"Neither here nor there, but congrats for going all the way with your scouting. Organizing & fulfilling an eagle project's quite an accomplishment for a 17-18 yr old."
5011,"Thank you! I couldn't have done it without a lot of help and direction from wiser adults who helped guide me through the process. 

I do think the coolest thing here is that home Depot invested in a project that would help their community, and also gain a loyal customer for life. Interestingly enough, I just bought my first home last year and it happened to be right next to the very same home Depot that helped me. It's equidistant to the nearest Lowe's, but I still to this day feel almost obligated, in a good way, to support HD. It feels good to do all my diy shopping there during social distancing."
5012,"Our local HD gave my son a discount for his Eagle scout project as well, and IIRC, Lowe's would not, so that may be a corporate thing."
5013,Same thing happened to me 20 years ago
5014,"Mine gave me something like 15% off ten years ago. They also allowed me buy a whole pallet of quikrete (56 bags at 80lbs per bag!) at the contractor rate, and then let me return the unused bags."
5015,"Our Lowe’s just donated a ton of gardening tools, irrigation supplies, and other stuff to the local police department for them to build a community garden. This is possibly more about the individual stores than corporate level policies."
5016,I always find myself leaving Lowe’s and going to HD because they have more
5017,"Also, this is a nitpick, but when using the app in-store in Lowes, where the app tells you an item is located, like aisle and bay, it's usually totally inaccurate and I spend an extra 5 minutes looking or flagging an employee.  Home Depot app is always spot on when using it in-store."
5018,💯
5019,100% HD got it down. Also prefer their in house brands vs lowes. I love all the Husky stuff in general.
5020,Wow that is the complete opposite in my area.
5021,"If you're buying things like actual hardware, HD has a much better selection, particularly metric. It's nowhere near as good as Ace/True Value type hardware stores of course, but it's certainly better stocked than Lowe's is in that regard."
5022,"That too is the complete opposite in my area, Lowes is the only place with a decent metric selection and the only ones with automotive grade shear resistant bolts"
5023,My lowes is better for appliances and lighting but nothing else. HD got them beat for general hardware and anything else.
5024,Depending on the size store near you. This can influence the assortment by 25%.
5025,"I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit."
5026,This. Lowes has the worst customer service ever
5027,Yep. I had a couple of guys in the lumber department talk down to me (female building stuff) so I left my lumber at Lowes and went to Home Depot. Never been back and I’ve never regretted it.
5028,"Open condescension is what I too have experienced in plumbing. I needed to get a bunch of plumbing fittings, and the guy just went went tired while helping me."
5029,">I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit.

I used to frequent Lowe's after one bad experience at HD with an asshole employee. Just at a bad time I guess. I've since experienced their employees are more knowledgeable in my area - or at least try to help in some way.

Over time I got sick of the know nothing and holier than thou attitudes at Lowe's. Every one of the Lowe's in my area are seemingly full of the type of employees that post in r/lowes."
5030,"I agree. I have become much more familiar with the layout of the store and where to find certain things than their staff. The breaking point for me at Lowe's was when I was looking for a threaded insert for something I was building. I showed the guy in the hardware dept a picture and explained what I was looking for. He told me ""I don't think anyone makes anything like that. I'm pretty sure you'll have to find a way to machine it"". I ended up just finding it myself and never went back."
5031,"I live in Atlanta—the Home Depot Mecca— and I still find that the few Lowes around generally have a better selection. I *want* to use HD exclusively because theyre so convenient for me, but they just dont have the selection."
5032,"Lowes seems to have more of a focus selling you on contactors. 

Home Depot is more focused on selling to contractors."
5033,Exactly. Case in point this morning. Needed a 1/2 inch toilet supply line. Lowes only had 3/8.  HD down the street had an entire selection of them...
5034,Whoever is closer
5035,"Bingo, there are basically no Lowe's in Chicago"
5036,"I think its regional, Home Depot here has really good customer service, Lowe's just seems confused. Also Lowes is full of gimmicky garbage tools."
5037,"I've had a different experience. At Home Depot the staff is chipper and *seemingly* helpful, but I haver never gotten an answer. What does happen over and over with them is that they'll say they need to go ask someone who knows and then never come back. 
    
At Lowe's, they aren't fake friendly, don't leave to flag down another sucker, and actually know some things about the section. 
   
It just feels like Home Depot spends all their training effort on the assumption that their people won't be there long enough to be useful, so may as well train them to be nice."
5038,"Lowe’s employees receive little training, usually the people that work there have been there for way too long and hate life and a couple years ago corporate got rid of dept managers and left area managers, fired a bunch of people and... yeah... fuck Lowe’s"
5039,"is that what happened? I have indeed noticed low morale there.

Also the in-store music has lots of minor-key songs for some reason."
5040,"Yeah, former dept managers had to apply to become area (it might be zone managers) managers and have about 5 dept under their supervision (and those that didn’t get the positions were fired) All installed sales, HR management and similar positions were eliminated and they got a customer service line in some state that takes all calls and deals with installations and complaints. 

And then again, some of the people have been there way too long and have had to deal with customers that make you wish you could drink some bleach for breakfast."
5041,"Home Depot > Lowe's

HD is usually a little cheaper, has awesome cheap 5 gal buckets, and has 4 self checkouts + one register. Lowe's takes forever to get through checkout, usually only 1 or 2 registers open, rarely 3. Forget going to Lowe's on the weekend, it's a complete shit show. HD gets worse on weekends as well, but not Lowe's bad. This is of course my local stores, probably not a nation wide thing. 

Lowe's feels more like Sears + Hardware store  
HD feels more like a dedicated hardware store."
5042,"In my area HD has a much more modern self check out system. You just grab the gun and scan away, without even removing stuff from your cart.

Lowes on the other hand still has the self checkout system that makes you put everything on their scale/bagging area after you scan it. Try buying a few loose nuts and bolts that practically weigh nothing and dont register anything on their scale, you will be there forever. Item is in the bagging area it just doesnt fuckin weigh anything. Then the cashier comes over hits a few buttons to make the system ignore the scale and it works for the 1 item and then they walk away... but, but I still have 30 more nuts to scan and I have to wait for her to come back 30 more times. This was right after I watched a guy going around their flooring section for 15 minutes shouting ""hello, does anyone work here?"" 

Fuck Lowe's. HD all the way.

Either way whenever I'm doing the self checkout my mind always goes back to Bill Burr's rant about the self checkout at grocery stores."
5043,"My Lowe's doesn't have self-checkout and there's usually only one register open.

I go to Home Depot."
5044,"Yes! I liked hd as they seem to have better tools but the biggest win is the checkout. I walk up, scan my stuff, pay and leave. At Lowe's they have the slowest lines. The old ladies working the register are nice but soooo slow"
5045,My exact experience
5046,I forgot that Lowe’s takes forever to check out
5047,"When I worked at Home Depot I used to be jealous that the guys at Lowes across the street got to wear the blue vest and we had to wear some bullshit apron.

So there's that.

edit: Looking at some of these answers, just want to point a few things out.
HD and Lowes both have a military/veteran discount. Both allow dogs on leashes inside. Also, any HD cashier has the authority to give you 10% or $50 off, up to $50. You just have to ask for it basically."
5048,"I didn’t realize Home Depot had a policy allowing dogs in stores. Wife and I were in Home Depot a few months ago purchasing window treatments. As we were sitting with the associate, guy walked past with his daughter and off-leash dog. Dog proceeded to take massive dump on the floor and scooted around, smearing it all over the place. Guy either didn’t notice or didn’t care and started to walk away, but my wife noticed and called him out. He came up to the associate who gave him paper towels and spray to clean it up."
5049,That is not ok ha
5050,Oh my god this happened at my Home Depot too except the giant dog peed a 1 gal puddle in the middle of an aisle.
5051,"I have bought my dog a few times to HD, mostly when she was younger in order to socialize her, and for this reason always find some grass outside for her before we go in."
5052,"OMG how do you not notice your unleashed dog taking a huge dump and scoot around. 

The owner sounds like quite the self-aware, winner."
5053,Our HD wanted to call and verify veterans. They would only give discounts to retired and 100 disabled veterans. That’s none of their business. Our HD is crappy.
5054,"At Lowe's I had to register at customer service and provide my dd214.  I guess they must have had an issue with fakers or something.   However,  now I just give them my phone # and show my retiree ID and it applies my discount and emails my receipt to me, which is convenient."
5055,HD got rid of their veterans discount a few years ago. Did they bring it back recently?
5056,"For vets, it’s 10% on Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Independence Day only. 

For active duty, it’s applicable all of the time. I believe both have discounts limited to $500"
5057,If I ask and show VA id Depot still gives discount to me.  Granted they do exclude a lot of items
5058,I use my veterans discount every time I go to HD.  Just show my license which has my veteran status on it.
5059,Me too. Except I don't even have to show any id
5060,"Yea they never really look now, most of them know me....damn new old house lol.  I used to not use for cheaper stuff but really saving 1-5 bucks 2-3 times a week starts to add up!"
5061,I’ve used my vets discount twice a week for the last bunch of months while renovating my house. I don’t know if the stopped other places but mine has worked consistently for the last 5 years or so
5062,Hmmm. I dont think that true. I've been using HD veteran discount at checkout and I have always gotten it. The only times I've had issues have been on online orders.
5063,Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.
5064,"> Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.

It has always been a per-store policy. Most stores allow them, but I have been to both HD and Lowes stores that didn't."
5065,"I don't have an HD near me, so it's Lowe's or Menards. Every time I go to Lowe's I always swear I'm going to boycott it. Definitely Menards."
5067,I can't find a damn thing at Lowe's.  Menards.
5068,Menards beats the pants off both in terms of selection.
5069,"I'm a contractor.  Home depot is more seeded within my working radius however I use both.  I am more familiar with Home Depot, their store layouts and their products.  On the occasion I go into Lowes, I find their layout seems to be more standardized.

I have a $12,500 credit limit with Home Depot and only $2,500 with Lowes, however as a Platinum PRO I get a 2.5% discount with Home Depot but I get 5% with Lowes.  I spend roughly $60,000 a year.

The return policies at both stores are about the same, but I can just use my card at Home Depot whereas I have to save my receipt to do returns at Lowes.  

Assistance (or lack thereof) isn't really an issue with me (lol I know more than you... aka Ron Swanson).  The HD app on my phone is useful but I've never checked to see if Lowes has one.

A decade ago, I had a conversation with my friend who convinced me to go independent and our conclusion was that Home Depot was best suited for the contractor however Lowes had better Designer options.

All stores have theft protocols.

I'm well accustomed to the automatic checkout with Home Depot however I do like the probability of having a human available at Lowes.  

End of the day, I use Home Depot more, but that's because there's one less than a mile away from my house on my path to most of my jobs.  I've got a lot of familiar strangers that I can say hi to when I start my day."
5070,"I like HD better in general, they have a deeper selection of products, tools, lumber and trim.  I like Behr paint a lot more than Valspar, and I like Ridgid tools a lot more than kobalt.

I go to Lowe's 95% of the time though, because I can take my dog on a leash and get her some exercise and social time, so unless I need paint or tools, Lowe's it is.

I've been trying to go to Ace/local lumber yard lately, but the lumber yard people are so rude, it feels like they do not want you there.  I love Ace stores, except they're so small I always have to go somewhere else to get everything I need."
5071,The HDs by me all allow pets on leash.
5072,"I've seen pets at HD, but when I checked their website about a year ago, the official policy was only service animals.  The sign at the front door of my local HD says the same thing.  I probably could take the dog, but when someone's kid runs up and pokes her in the butthole, and she turns around and barks and scares them, I don't want to have to deal with the drama of her technically not supposed to have been there."
5073,Sorry about the butthole thing.  I had been drinking.
5074,"Yes. All the Home Depot’s here about a year ago changed it to no dogs allowed. Besides service, obviously. Lowe’s you can still bring them."
5075,"It's common for lumberyards that mostly deal with pros to be dismissive of hobbyists/homeowners. Unfortunate but true. It's so hard to find a good one, I miss going to Highland in NH."
5076,"The lumber yard here has such a nice selection of stuff, and the guys in the yard are always nice, and they offer to cut the 16's in half for me, which I don't need them to do but it's thoughtful.  The ones in the office are 50% awesome, helpful, give good advice, and 50% so rude without good reason, I'm probably going to only go there for stock nobody else carries."
5077,"Sounds like where I work, oddly enough. Which is also a small and local lumberyard."
5078,HD for contacting Lowe's for homeowners
5079,"Yup, this is exactly how I word it. HD for materials, Lowe's for products works too"
5080,"This.  Also for more advanced homeowners the HD near me is better, especially with wood selection.  The customer service is horrible, unfortunately.

Edit: Lowe's won't do home delivery for me where HD will. Sorry, I don't own a pickup for deck lumber..."
5081,"Honestly, HD lost my appliance business when they wouldn't let me pick up a microwave, because its an appliance, so it must be delivered.  I might have let that one go, but the $399 microwave was on sale for 10% off, which put the price below $396, which is their cutoff for free delivery, so they were going to chance a $59 delivery fee.  So they wanted me to pay $455, plus tax, for a $399 microwave, that was on sale.

I went to Best Buy and picked up the exact same model microwave two days later, for $369 + tax."
5082,"Home Depot is the epitome of ""not my department, go see that guy"".

It once took me 2.5 hours for them to find my a tools chest that they said they had 5 in stock of. I eventually left and ordered it online to pick up in store. I got an email the next day saying it was ready for pick up. I arrive and nobody has a clue what's going on. Repeat day 1. I cancelled order, called customer service to get original order refunded and then requested that it be shipped to my house free of charge. The product came in two boxes. Only one box was shipped. They didn't believe me that only one box shipped and ask that I take a picture to verify only one box showed up. I was just like ""how can I take a picture of a box that doesn't exist?"". They told me they would send the second box. Guess what showed up 3 days later? Two boxes or the original product. I called and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send the item back, not a chance, get me a return label. They did, I send it back and then get a phone call that I only returned part of an item and that my credit card will be charged if the entire item isn't recieved.

I now shop at Rona."
5083,"I have a friend who was trying to get a dishwasher installed.  He bought it and picked it up, Home Depot set up the installation for the next weekend.  Two days later the Home Depot delivery truck stopped by and left another dishwasher on his patio while he was out.  The weekend came, the installer showed up....with another dishwasher in his truck.  He ended up taking two back, got so tired of waiting for someone to understand what was going on that he just left them and went home."
5084,"Worse help and better selection, count me in."
5085,I agree with this gentleman although the Lowe’s by me does a better job of making sure hardware is in the right place/bins. Checkout times are all over the place right now at both ime.
5086,"Exactly what I came here to say, I think the interior atmosphere of each chain reflects this."
5087,"I was in the process of replacing a toilet and needed my husband's help holding it while I got it lined up but his grip was slipping so the toilet dropped by about an inch.  It was just far enough that the edge of it tapped the basement floor and shattered the front of the brand new toilet.  This had already been a hell of a project as I had to replace the flange and re-cement the floor (why the fuck would someone embed a donut-shaped piece of plywood into cement to screw the flange into).  I headed back to Home Depot to purchase a replacement and took my daughter along for the ride.  While at the store a staff member helped me load a toilet onto a cart while I told her the tale of the smashed toilet.  My daughter needed to pee so I left the cart and rushed my daughter halfway across the giant store with the urgency required of a 4 year-old's emergency.

When I got back to my cart there was an invoice sitting on it for $0 stating ""customer satisfaction"" and a hand-written note wishing me a wonderful evening.  

They didn't have to do that. I didn't ask for anything because I was totally at fault.  They definitely won my business that day."
5088,That's cool. Good employers empower thier employees to make good decisions like this. This sort of thing is worth way more in advertisment than anything a marketing person can come up with.
5089,"Lowe’s when ordering online (and not needing it immediately because their online pick up orders take forever compared to HD) because I can log in and verify my veteran status and get the discount...

HD if I’m going to the local store"
5090,"I use lowes for the discount also, but sometime I think their prices are 9% higher than hd."
5091,Oh I got back and forth on the app to see if it’s cheaper to just go into HD or easier and cheaper to go through Lowes
5092,Been waiting 2 days for Lowe’s to fill my order
5093,Damn longest I waited preCOVID was 5 1/2 days and that’s only because I called like where’s my order at lol
5094,No one answers the phone so I guess I have to go in person and prob just pull it all myself. Annoyed.
5096,"Yeah I got a few things I ordered relatively quickly but after waiting another week I realized they cancelled half of the items without ever telling me. 

Their system is whack. I ordered a couple ceiling fans, 14/3 Romex, switches, face plates, etc and they would mail like 1 box with 1 face plate and another box with another face plate and another separate box with a switch in it. It was the romex and junction box they just randomly dropped off the order for no reason."
5098,"O neat! does Canada have a military?

(Just jokes man!)"
5099,Slap them
5100,"Lowes doesn't carry Milwaukee tools soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

&#x200B;

But for real, I go to both for different things, or when there's no preference. Usually HD for tools and construction lumber, Lowes for select lumber and electrical, HD for gardening, and other than that I shop at both for whatever I need. Lowes has a horrible online store and inventory system, so I typically only do online orders through HD.

The milwork person at my local Lowes is MUCH better than Home Depot's. She also gave me contractor pricing on our order which was very nice. Home Depot was a pain in the ass to work with getting our patios doors ordered and successfully delivered."
5101,"Ah yes, one of the other reasons I don’t go to Lowe’s.  Lowe’s craftsman always confuses me. I see red and I’m like “woohoo milwaukee!”  Then I get closer and am disappointed"
5102,Love my new Milwaukee tools
5103,"I try to avoid both honestly.

My local electrical supply house has a way better selection and usually better prices on anything electrical related.  HD and Lowes are both INSANELY HIGH on their price per ft for wire, probably because most people just don't know better.

There's a large local lumberyard about the same distance away as HD, their prices are comparable, sometimes cheaper.  Nicest part is, I can call them up and rattle off a list of materials I need, show up a half hour later and they have it all stacked and wrapped on a pallet ready to load into my truck.  They also have a great project desk that is more than willing to help design & spec out things like decks, fences, awnings or lean-tos, etc. for no extra fee."
5104,Comparing HD and Lowe's to a dedicated supply house isn't fair. Of course the electrical supply place will be better for electrical stuff. But it's not a one stop shop.
5105,"Home Depot seems to be marginally cheaper than Lowe’s, at least when I’ve compared prices online before going to the store. Lowes employees tend to be more helpful."
5106,"I used to favor Home Depot because I drove past it every day, then moved and switched to Lowes because it's closer now. Of the two, my Home Depot no longer has knowledgeable people to ask questions (they all seem to be minimum-wage clerks who don't even pretend to know anything) while Lowe's still does.

If I need a lot of lumber, I avoid the big box stores and go to an actual lumber yard because of the huge quality difference."
5107,"Lowe's bought OSH, a local hardware store that was really nice, and pretty much immediately closed them all down.

Because of that I only shop at Home Depot now."
5108,"I also miss Orchard Supply. It was the closest hardware store (and only one when I was young) and small enough that I knew where everything was. My local one always had a nice garden center and pet supplies, too.

But despite that, I still hate Home Depot more than Lowe's. I can never find anything at HD, the inventory system is worthless (there should be 20 of something, but there are zero on the aisle), and their app only ever says ""ask an associate"" when I try to use it for item locations."
5109,"I’ve had good experiences at Ace and True Value, but they’re both pretty far from my house."
5110,"Home depot. I find that similar products are almost always either cheaper, OR higher quality at HD. I use Ryobi and Milwaukee cordless tools (not sold at Lowes). Lowe's is closer, though, so I'll go there for pest repellant, lawn chairs, maybe gardening tools...it seems like 60% of the time when I ned something very specific, Lowe's won't have it, and then I'll need to go to HD anyway. I've had better luck with home Depot's customer service."
5111,Home Depot because Milwaukee.
5112,"In the Mpls/St. Paul area I find both have about the same level of service and quality .  I go to HD most of the time because it's close, but honestly I'd rather go to Lowe's as the styles look better to me (e.g., lighting).

Here's a tip I saw on Reddit a few years ago if you need help at HD but nobody is around:  Start climbing one of those ladders in an aisle and associates will come out of nowhere to help you."
5113,"Just here to ask everyone, no matter what your opinion of the retail company, the store, the brand, etc., that in the midst of everything that is going on try to remember that these retail employees are just folks like the rest of us. 

But with one big difference that you might not be thinking of: 

You'll make the trip to the store today, practice some social distancing, mask if you can, be mindful of what you touch, get your purchases and head home having come into close contact with no more than a dozen or so strangers. And you may only have to do that once or twice a week.

Retail employees are in these stores every day, eight hours per shift, encountering probably around a thousand strangers every shift, limited opportunity to distance, sanitize, mask, etc. For some it's quite stressful. They have families too, with loved ones they want desperately to protect. 

Cut 'em some slack."
5114,"I'm the worst shopper... or what they bank on. I like Lowe's because of how bright everything is, how the store is laid out, and ultimately, I like the color blue over orange.  Yeah, I'm that guy.

Recently, I figured out that my HD had a better selection of wood than Lowe's, but that might've been skewed since there were more morons like me shopping at Lowe's than HD and bought out the good stuff.

I'd thought their prices on lumber would be close but found a deal the other day on 7/16 OSB at HD that was easily $7 less than at Lowe's.

I think Lowe's is like home repair with training wheels and HD is more for serious workers."
5116,"I never find myself in Lowes.
I prefer Home Depot over Lowes. Menards over both."
5117,I'll drive 40 minutes away to go to Menards over the home Depot that's 5 minutes from my house. I don't know that I've ever had a bad experience there.
5118,"Luckily, Menards is the closest to my house. I especially love the fact I can drive my truck right into their yard to load lumber and pavers. I hate loading a cart with boards and pushing it through the store like I have to do at Big Orange and Big Blue."
5119,"The closest Menards to my house is about 2 hrs away, and I actually have gone there before over HD or Lowe's.

But it's absolutely not practical to do routinely.

Menards is one of the things I miss the most about living in the midwest."
5120,"Bought a 12 year old house with a Glacial Bay faucet. Stopped working and went to Home Depot to get a new one. Manager ended up crediting the full amount of the old faucet on the spot if I promised to bring the original in.

Faucet was likely 5+ years old at that point and he knew I didn’t even buy it originally, but he said they stand by their products. Best customer service experience I’ve ever had and I shop there exclusively now."
5121,Menard's!
5122,"Lowe's jebaited me out of a pair of flush cutters. I saw a red and white package that said Milwaukee on it, figured out was a good enough brand and paid. Turns out it was some shit tier no name Chinesium brand that had this on the packaging:

^Made ^in

#Milwaukee

^Wisconsin

Probably not Lowe's fault, but I've held a grudge ever since."
5123,Home Depot except for the garden section. Lowe’s has a larger/ better plant selection.
5124,"The Home Depot nearest to me is a complete cell phone dead zone the second you walk in the door and it probably sounds dumb, but if I'm making a major purchase in a store I like the option of being able to really quickly google something before I buy it."
5125,I work for Coca-Cola. HD has a Coke contract. Lowes has Pepsi contract. So that's one way of choosing..
5126,"They’re so similar to me. Sometimes Lowes is better sometimes HD is better. 

Where I live they are across the street from one another. Super helpful when I can’t find what I need at one."
5127,"The self checkout machine at Lowes shorted me 3 dollars on a 10 dollar cash back. I didn't touch the money and called the attendant. She called a manager who proceeded to say that since she wasn't there and didn't see it happen she couldn't do anything. I said that was fine and I'll just grab a soda and call it even only to be told I couldn't take it without paying.

How was I not paying? The till had my money in there. She said to leave my number and they'd call me at the end of the day after they counted the cash.By that point I had already been standing there taking up a spot with a growing line so I just decided to take my L and walk away. There was no point in continuing to press the issue over 3 dollars otherwise I'd get more upset and stew in it all day.

As an employee I can understand where she was coming from but as a customer I wanted to throw the 7 dollars it did give me in her face because she kept giving me this look like I was trying to pull some kind of scam."
5128,They both seem to source their lumber from the same twisted trees.  Finding a straight board in either seems damn near impossible.
5129,"I am convinced that whats happened in both is they started with a stack of lumber, 90% of it was straight so people bought that.  They ordered another stack, threw the leftover crooked 10% on top, and sold the good 90%, adding another 10% to the crooked pile.  This went on until they had a pile that was 100% crooked lumber, they don't order any new lumber because inventory shows they have a giant stack of it.  Nobody bothers to look and see that the entire stack is warped."
5130,"If you leave every piece of warped wood on the floor in a pile, eventually someone will get mad enough to come ask you what the fuck you're doing and then also assist you in finding straight wood."
