47603,"Include a drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Walk up Sharp Top mountain at Peaks of Otter (4 hours round trip including plenty of time to take in the view at the top and moderately strenuous).

On the other edge of the state, drive across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel and drive up to Chincoteague area and visit the Assateague National Seashore.  Visit Island Creamery for some excellent ice cream."
47605,The stalagmite (stalactite?) organ in Luray is SO fucking cool.
47606,"For VA depends a lot on what you're into.  Williamsburg is probably the most unique thing we've got.  Lots of people like Mount Vernon, too, that was George Washington's house. (If you're into Jefferson, Monticello is good too). 

For natural beauty, my vote is Great Falls Park.  Google it."
47607,"I went to California when I was in 3rd grade (over 20 years ago) and I still *vividly* remember the beauty of Big Sur.

Go to Big Sur."
47608,"Big Sur was hit really hard by a wildfire that took almost three months to get under control last fall (the soberanes fire). It will recover, those biomes evolved to burn periodically, but it will take a few years to return to the beauty you remember as a child. So depending on when OP is doing the trip, it might not be the top choice in California."
47609,Don't forget that last winter forced its major route to Big Sur to close due to landslides and bridge collapse
47610,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the bridge and all the landslides. Rough season for that area."
47611,"For New York, it's really NYC. Upstate is also pretty, but NYC is such an incredibly unique city."
47612,"I agree. As much as I prefer the mountains, there are more states with mountain ranges than cities of this scale. I'd also recommend different waterfalls over Niagara."
47613,I hear the Canadian side is better
47614,"It really is. Niagara Falls, NY is basically a run-down Rust Belt city with not much to do (other than walk around the state park... it's a great park, to be fair). 

The Canadian side has a bunch of really good restaurants, bars, casinos, etc. - and you can get way closer to the falls than you can on the other side. And the view of all 3 falls is a lot better from Ontario than New York."
47616,Been to both sides. You are absolutely right
47617,"Yeah. I think [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/oSuqv) is the most up close picture I've been able to get of the Falls (taken yesterday afternoon); I don't think I've managed anything like it from the NY side, but maybe other people have."
47618,"> and you can get way closer to the falls than you can on the other side

Luna Island gets you as close to the US falls as you can, I believe.  Most people never bother to venture outside the regular part of the state park, but you can still get close on the US.  

Otherwise, spot on.  The view and experience is better in Ontario."
47619,"If you're looking into Upstate - the Finger Lakes, Saratoga Springs, and Lake George are all really worth it."
47620,Adirondacks is my favorite place in the entire world
47622,"I'm planning on retiring to the Finger Lakes...But if you only could visit one, I'd tell you visit NYC. But if you visit 2 places, check out the Finger Lakes."
47623,the finger lakes are absolutely beautiful. but yeah if you can only do 1 thing it has to be nyc
47624,"Washington State: Olympic National Park.

Washington has a lot of destinations and some iconic places but it's hard to beat the diversity of beautiful nature in ONP."
47625,I'd also add on the San Juan Islands.
47626,Olympic National Park is right up there with one of my favorite places in the entire country.
47627,Spent a lot of weekends over there this summer. It always amazes me that something so beautiful and majestic is just a few hours away.
47628,Came here to say this. Would also add that if you're even slightly into wine Walla Walla is incredible.
47630,North Cascades National Park. I'd argue are just as gorgeous. Also Palouse Falls too.
47631,"Very true. The Washington Pass Overlook is stunning and is just off the main road.

However, OP suggests ONE and I picked ONP.

On a good day Mount Rainier is also phenomenal."
47632,Lots of beautiful land in Eastern WA as well
47634,"California-

The culture spots like Hollywood and SF are sorta cool, but the parks are the thing that'll blow your mind. Sequoia Nat. Park, the NorCal redwoods, Yosemite, and really all of the Sierra Nevada are the things that will blow your mind."
47636,Or Red River Gorge/Natural Bridge :)
47637,Mammoth Cave was going to be my suggestion as well. It's amazing.
47638,"Smokey Mountains National Park! And if you visit them through Gatlinburg TN, they have a lot of super gimmickey tourist traps and shops. The Ripley Aquarium is cute. And Pigeon Forge has all the go karting, fair rides, laser tag, dinner shows, etc. that you can think of. And of course, the mecca of Tennessee..DOLLYWOOD"
47639,"Tennessee really has three hot spots spread across the state between the smoky mountains, Nashville, and Memphis. I currently live in Memphis and it is *vastly* different than eastern Tennessee."
47640,"Memphis: BBQ and tap water (but of a local joke, but still). My favorite BBQ is Exit 87 BBQ at Exit 87 on I-40.

Nashville: 2nd Avenue. Honky Tonk bars abound, and there's more than just that (symphony, Opry, etc.).

East: Knoxville is beautiful, but the main draw is GSMNP, which is the most visited national park, period. If you want to see a mountain town without so much traffic, go to Townsend. It's a slightly more chill Gatlinburg.

Go Titans, Go Vols, Go Preds!"
47641,"Missouri:
We have the Lake of the Ozarks (and the surrounding area), many state parks, and a bunch of caves.  As far as cities go, Kansas City is must because of the BBQ.  St Louis is also worth visiting, although I'd do a bit of research on where to go/avoid since it doesn't have a great reputation, especially here on Reddit.  If you're into tourist traps Branson can also be fun for like a day or two."
47642,"Branson is the most Dolly Parton-tourist trap in the world... but Silver Dollar City, though."
47643,"Colorado

Pikes Peak There's a road that takes you to the top of one of the most famous mountains in America. From there you can see amber waves of grain."
47644,"I'd recommend climbing Mt. Elbert. Second tallest mountain in the continental US and tallest in Colorado. It's a solid day hike for anyone in at least somewhat good shape and you'll get the ""holy shit I climbed a real mountain"" feeling. It's nice for beginners because it requires ZERO technical skills. It's just a walk to the top!"
47645,"Also if you're into beer, there's about a million and one craft breweries in Colorado."
47646,"Least interesting, most over-commercialized thing in our state.  You can drive up mt Evans too, that's a little better."
47647,"Wisconsin:
The Dells (near Wisconsin Dells) are amazing. Not the tourist trap stuff, but the actual terrain. 
The north woods are beautiful and the south coast of Superior. 
And a drive through the fox valley is pleasant. 
As for actual places, Lambeau Field is a must for a sports fan. Hit a local brewery or brew pub. There's a million of them and I've yet to have a bad local beer. Try a local cheese too, like curds warm from the vat."
47648,Let's not forget The House on the Rock.  You can get in but you can't get out.
47649,Devils lake in Baraboo is awesome too
47650,"NJ, I'd say either the boardwalk at night in the summer, or a top notch Italian place somewhere around Essex county."
47651,"Yeah, a Jersey beach town is definitely the highlight of the state. My vote is for Cape May. A lot of people forget about it so it's a lot less crowded and it's adorably quaint, with historic houses built around the end of the 19th century into the early 20th century."
47652,"If you're doing the boardwalk go to a once-removed boardwalk; not one of the famous ones.

I would suggest Ocean City, NJ. Nice boardwalk, nice town, perfect NJ Shore experience; as in, it looks like it was built in the 1970s and never touched again."
47654,"I live in CA now, but grew up in jersey. My favorite 2 spots are island beach state park, and the Delaware water Gap. Both are best seen in summer, but I'm sure still pretty in the fall/spring"
47655,"Hutchinson KS is a small city northwest of Wichita that has two exceptional attractions: the [Cosmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmosphere), a superb space museum; and [Strataca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strataca), a massive underground salt mine."
47656,The Flint Hills/Konza Prairie area is an incredible sunset.
47657,"The Sandhills in Nebraska- also the Niobrara River 
Also the Wooping Crane migration in the fall"
47658,Came here to say the Sandhills. Grass covered dunes might not sound like much but it's the largest system of sand dunes in North America and is also the largest wetland ecosystem in the country. It's native pre-settlement state is something like 90+% intact. Driving through it in May should be on everyone's to do list.
47659,Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha. Consistently rated one of the best zoos in the world. You can spend a whole day there and still not see everything.
47660,Currently residing in Minnesota. Definitely the north shore of Lake Superior.
47661,Highway 61 is one of my favorite roads ride in the country.
47662,"The Atlantic coast is divided up among 14 different states; the Pacific coast consists of 3 states. So any state by state short list of highlights is going to miss a lot out west.

How to describe California?

There's [Venice Beach](https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_section/public/media/activities/venice-beach-king-solomon.jpg?itok=sinrd-7w) - a sort of permanent carnival

or [San Diego Harbor](https://i2.wp.com/www.sandiegocatcruises.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/san-diego-harbor.jpg) with its maritime museum.

or [Big Sur](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/7c/ee/53/big-sur.jpg) for pure natural beauty

or maybe you just can't resist the [Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.heise.de/imagine/jbiusiXD2YhZj1bN3daLb4R7O3Q/gallery/Golden-Gate-Bridge-San-Francisco.jpg)

Back east these would all be in different states, the way the states divide up there.

Or just come for Disneyland."
47663,"Pennsylvania has Hershey Park, which is an awesome amusement park centered around the Hershey Chocolate Factory.  Also Philly has a lot to see, as does Pittsburgh."
47664,Gettysburg is a must.
47665,What's the address?
47666,4 score drive between 7 and 8 years boulevard
47667,6/10
47668,Or 3/5ths
47669,"If you're in Pittsburgh, RIDE THE INCLINE. It's one of our oldest attractions, and gives a pretty sweet view of everything. Also check out the view from Mount Washington (but don't go too far into mt Washington it's kinda ghetto)."
47670,I'd also say exploring the Cathedral of Learning is something to do - that building is nothing short of amazing.
47671,My favorite thing about Pennsylvania was just riding around on mountainous country roads in the car.
47672,"The PA Ren Faire is supposed to be one of the best in the States. I've only been to a couple of others, myself, but the PA Ren Faire was *by far* the best."
47673,"Oregon:
- crater lake
- the coast

There's so much more... I've lived in 5 different states and Oregon is easily my favorite"
47674,"I’ve lived in Texas and Oregon and will probably be kicked out of Texas for saying this, but Oregon is a million times better. Much better weather and it’s way prettier."
47675,"There's too many cool things in WV to list, but I'd recommend checking out the campus of one of our many colleges (WVU or WVSU are my personal favorites), seeing the Greenbrier, or being cliche and going to the Capitol building. Any of these will give at least a taste of the fascinating stuff we have to offer.

Edit: We also have a lot of weird high school mascots. Mine was a Poca Dot!"
47677,"Michigan. We have thousands of miles of freshwater coast, 4/5 of the Great Lakes, thousands of beaches, three national parks, and the most lighthouses of any state in the US"
47678,[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/at-the-track/museum)
47680,"I live about 10 miles from Santa Claus, Indiana. Can confirm it's like constant Christmas, but then you can go to French Lick's casino and feel like you're in LA. Even better if you end your night with a trip to the Chicago's in French Lick, and go home to Ireland."
47681,"**Arkansas**

Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, AR is a must-see.  

Eureka Springs, AR is a very unique town with a spooky haunted hotel.  

Hot Springs, AR for the horse races, Garvan Gardens, and the hot springs.

Floating the Buffalo River has absolutely beautiful scenery."
47682,Don't forget pinnacle mountain.
47683,Can confirm spooky haunted hotel in Eureka Springs
47684,"There's also an amazing antique car museum as you're heading to Little Rock from Fort Smith. They've got a couple of Elvis cars and stuff.

It's kinda cool how if you drive from NW Arkansas to SE Arkansas it goes from all mountain with trees to hilly with farmland everywhere, then it just flattens out into trees everywhere. Just everywhere."
47685,"Hey! I recently saw my 50th state using one of those 45 day Amtrak rail passes. I didn't see all 50 this trip, but over the course of the last 6 years. Here's a few highlights from my trips:

- Barrow, Alaska. You can't really get a similar experience anywhere else in the world. The sense of serenity and peace is incredible, and it's really hard to believe you are still in the United States.

- Alburquerque, NM. Go up the mountain in the skycar. Desert views unlike anywhere else I've been on the planet. Also great cuisine and roadrunners (not related).

- Portland, OR. Weird and wonderful, and I hope to  move here permanently one day. Beautiful women, beautiful landscape, quirky folk.

- Houston, Tx. The space centre is a must. Maybe go another time though.

- New Orleans, Louisiana. INCREDIBLE Jazz scene, I think it's the only place I've seen somebody play a washboard to a crowd of cheering drunks. Bourbon street is a must, but only once. Venture all round the French Quarter, and then out into more of the city. I LOVED the world war 2 museum.

- Los Angeles, California. This was my least favourite place but you have to see it so you can wash the stars from your eyes. Hollywood is an absolute dump, there are shanty towns of homeless people downtown and there seems to be little to no interest paid to them from the locals. It's not the only city with a homeless problem, but it's definitely one of the worst.

These are the ones that come to mind immediately, and I've spread them far enough apart that you'd have to see plenty more between them along the way. America is an INCREDIBLE country."
47686,Alabama - U.S. Space and Rocket Center
47688,"Mississippi:

Natchez, the Natchez Trace and things along the trace like Windsor Ruins.

Also the delta area is something you can't miss if you like the blues, great food and a cultural experience like nowhere else. Specifically Clarksdale - the Shack Up Inn, New Roxy, Red's and other places around town"
47689,"Arkansas doesn't have a whole lot but some ""haunted"" hotels would be fun. Petit Jean mountain is a really cool place to hike during the spring. You definitely don't want to be here in the summer...you'll die..."
47690,"Petit Jean is one of my favorite places. Love the history, the beauty, and the view of the river. I'm not from Arkansas but whenever I take people there who haven't been, I make it a point to go to Petit Jean and do the overlook, the falls, the bear caves, etc."
47691,"Rhode Island: Breakers mansion in Newport, the house that inspired The Conjuring in Burriville, Providence Athanaeum which is supposedly haunted by Edgar Allan Poe

Edit: Mobile fucked up my spelling"
47692,"[Redfish lake](https://www.google.com/search?q=redfish+lake&client=safari&hl=en-gb&prmd=minv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwico8DvzP_VAhWE64MKHT8MCE4Q_AUIEigC&biw=320&bih=460#imgrc=we5xtH7teEy3-M:) in central Idaho is the prettiest place in the state, IMO. We also have great views of the Tetons with fewer people than the Wyoming side. 

If you're into more hardcore camping/backpacking there are all sorts of amazing places in central Idaho."
47693,Stay away from Eastern Montana. I would suggest the Flathead lake Glacier area or the Northern Yellowstone rivers area's. Honestly starting in Missoula you could get to either on some beautiful back roads in around 5-6 hours. Always take the scenic by-ways is the best overall advice I can give for visiting Montana.
47694,"For PA, the entire historic Philadelphia is great.

Don't go to the liberty bell. It is not worth it at all. 

Hershey park is about 2 hours away. That could be a lot of fun as well."
47695,"I love Pennsylvania.  And thought the Liberty Bell story was amazing.  Philly is a great town for history, food, sports, art.  Get out of Philly and you have Valley Forge which is breathtakingly beautiful, not to mention historically important.  The rest of the state has everything---shopping, the Amish areas, rolling hills, swell diners, Pittsburgh which is lovely except for all those tunnels, Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Gettysburgh, the Johnstown Flood Museum was absolutely incredible.  
Lots of history packed into that state."
47696,Glacier National Park in Montana! It's glorious!
47697,"Georgia.

I would recommend [Providence Canyon State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_Canyon_State_Park), AKA Georgia's Little Grand Canyon.

For the Atlanta area, I would recommend the World of Coke and National Center for Civil and Human Rights."
47699,"As someone who lives in Savannah, the worst thing is telling tourists that ""NO, You Can't eat the Spanish Moss."" Fucking idiots."
47700,"Also the aquarium, which is really really close to the world of coke."
47701,"It's right across the street. Pretty sure you can see it when you exit the world of come. 

Edit: I meant coke"
47702,"For the Atlanta area, skip World of Coke. 

Check out the Clermont Lounge."
47703,"Cloudland Canyon is also beautiful especially in the fall. 

Rock City is a fun place as well..technically it's in both Tennessee and Georgia but it has a Georgia address so I suppose it can count."
47705,"I haven't been to all 50, but I have been to many states and Texas is my favourite."
47706,"Come and see the hurricane.

Also Big Bend National Park is really nice.

But don't stay too long.  We're watching you."
47707,Definitely go during the State Fair in Dallas in the fall. But prepare your stomach should you partake of the crazy fried items they hawk during the fair.
47708,"Going off of this, it's important to remember that Texas is MASSIVE. Especially if you're from a significantly smaller state, it's important to realize that Dallas is quite different from Houston which is very different from Austin which is completely different from El Paso."
47709,"West Virginia : Dolly Sods/Spruce Knob/Seneca Rocks are my favorite.  Spruce knob is where I do a lot of native trout fishing, but even just driving through the mountains in that area, especially during the fall, is absolutely beautiful.

Spruce knob is the highest point in the state and if you go up to the very top, the spruce trees only grow branches on one side because of the strong winds up there.

Also, I'd highly recommend catching bridge day in October in summersville.  They close down the new river gorge bridge and base jumpers jump/catapult themselves off the bridge.  If you know you're going in advance, call the chamber of commerce and ask about a bus pass to take the bus to the bottom/top.  Generally, they close the road to the public that would take you to the bottom underneath the bridge, and the spectators are generally confined to the bridge itself or a scenic overlook off the the side to watch.  With the bus pass, you can hop on the buss that makes trips up and down the mountain to transport the jumpers.  Totally worth it.

There also a ton of hiking/biking trails, some
Of the best whitewater rafting in the country, and Summerville lake all in that area.  Not to mention the original pies and pints, in Fayetteville (which is a few miles beyond the new river gorge) which is a cool local pizza joint that is growing throughout the state that specializes in specialty craft pizzas and craft beer."
47710,"WV usually gets a bad rap, but it truly is a beautiful state to drive through."
47711,"Mississippi. Depending on your interests there are several things to see here. You could go through the delta and see the MS Blues Trail, visit Tupelo and see the birthplace of Elvis (I actually live in Tupelo and have only seen it once), the cemetery in Columbus where they took flowers to the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers every year and eventually it became Memorial Day, Vicksburg National Military Park, Rowan Oak in Oxford. The more I type out the more I think that you need to either be interested in history or music to enjoy most of MS attractions. But, if you're interested in those things you could have have a fun couple of days in the state. There are several more things to see, I'm just drawing a blank on most of it."
47712,"Depending on your proclivities, it'll either be the LDS temple, Arches Nat'l Park, the Wasatch Mountains, or perhaps the Bonneville Salt Flats.

However, as a Utah native, the most interesting thing to me is the town of Thistle. It was buried in a mudslide in the 80's and was completely abandonded. Some of the buildings still stand, although they're partially buried, and it's kinda spooky."
47713,"If you visit Louisiana, Mardi Gras in one form or another kind of has to be that thing.  But do yourself a favor and drive some of the smaller backroads.  Louisiana countryside peeking through an early morning fog can be quite breathtaking."
47716,The basement of the Alamo is better.
47717,"Skip the Alamo, and go see some of the other Spanish Missions in San Antonio. Mission San Antonio de Valero, Mission San José, Mission Concepción, Mission San Juan and Mission Espada are all UNESCO World Heritage sites."
47718,"North Carolina:

Depends of if you prefer the Mountains or the Beach.

Mountains:  Asheville is a great cool little town. Lots to do, local bars, very fun relaxed atmosphere.  You have skiing and snowboarding nearby, and lots of hiking trails.

Beach:  Hatteras beach is great for fishing.  Outer Banks is a great commercialized beach.  For OBX, try to schedule around a certain time to see the wild horses running up and down the beach."
47719,You can get from the mountains to the beach in 6-8 hours.  Why not both?
47720,"For Rhode Island, I'd recommend visiting Narragansett and Jamestown. They have great beaches and other cool nature spots. And you gotta check out some of the seafood, maybe at Iggy's Chowderhouse or Legal Sea Foods."
47721,"Maryland.

I'd recommend visiting the Maryland Heights Trail that overlooks Harpers Ferry WV when the leaves are changing colors. Exceptionally scenic. Yes, you're overlooking WV and VA but the trail itself is entirely in MD.

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/03/19/f8/0319f8a462ccec4e8f90ee0b71caa044.jpg

Pictures don't really do it justice."
47722,"Alaska: Seward Highway (in the summer/fall), Aleska, Denali, Matanuska Glacier.

Michigan: Upper Peninsula (over the Mackinac Island Bridge)"
47723,"If you come to Maine, I recommend doing so in the fall, when the leaves are changing colors. Hit up Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. Great views, great little tourist town. On the ocean. I cant really describe the with words. I grew up there and now that I'm moving around with the Coast Guard, I still love going back just to see this. Hit it up, you wont regret it."
47724,"Indiana. Manmade: the Indy 500 racetrack and museum, and the West Baden Springs Hotel. The biggest spectacle in racing, and what was once the largest unsupported dome in the world, atop a gorgeous refurbished old-timey luxury hotel. 

Natural: Various state parks, Turkey Run, Spring Mill, The Dunes. 

So a day trip could be 500/Turkey Run, or Hotel/Spring Mill."
47725,San Juan Islands - WA
47726,"No love for Louisiana yet?

There's a lot of choices, but first things first, I'd recommend staying south of Alexandria - no disrespect to North Louisiana, but it's not all that different from Mississippi/Arkansas/East Texas.

Honestly, most of your tour of Louisiana can stick pretty close to Interstate 10, which runs through Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge and New Orleans. That route will also get you pretty close to some of the outstanding fishing and hunting lodges the state has to offer. 

Louisiana has some excellent brackish water fishing, as well as superb hunting all along the Gulf Coast. You really can't go wrong. Do a bit of research before booking an outing. There are some fantastic lodges all along the I-10 corridor.

If you're within 10-20 miles of Lafayette, make extra sure to stop somewhere (anywhere, really) selling boudin and cracklins. That is some top-notch Cajun food. My personal favorite is a little red shack in a town called Scott, which is just a few miles west of Lafayette.

This should really hold true for any of the southeastern states on your list, but you absolutely **must** get your way into a proper LSU tailgate before a Saturday night Tigers game. High marks if you can get to an Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, or Arkansas game. Extra extra high marks if you can get Alabama tickets. My father and I tailgated for a season several years ago, and it was hands down one of the most incredible experiences I've ever witnessed. Outstanding food, copious amounts of booze, passionate and hospitable fans. Just be sure you're wearing purple and/or gold. I'm dead serious.

New Orleans doesn't really need much explanation beyond what you already know. Yes, the food is exceptional, Mardi Gras is what you'd expect a frat house to look like if you made an entire *city* out of it, and JazzFest is one of the most popular music festivals you'll find in the Southeast. Bourbon Street is what you make of it. It can be tits and Hurricanes if you want it to be, but if you're more laid back, you can definitely find some great bars to sit back and people watch. Old Absinthe House and Jean Lafitte's are my two personal favorites. Also, definitely give the Carousel Bar at Hotel Monteleone a shot, too. Avoid Decatur St., though. Very touristy and overpriced."
47727,"> No disrespect to N. Louisiana.

I've been to Shreveport and Bossier City. I'm OK with disrespecting N. Louisiana."
47728,"I went kayaking in a swamp near Slidell this summer. I highly recommend this!!  I was blown away by the beauty and the peaceful feeling.  Sure there were snakes and alligators, but they didn't seem too interested in us and just sorta went away when they saw us.  I never felt afraid.  Someone on our trip said there was an outfitter that offered midnight kayak swamp tours. That may end up being next.  (Or not)."
47729,If you are a fan of the Blues I would say the [Mississippi Blues trail](http://msbluestrail.org/index.aspx).
47730,"**Tennessee**

If you visit Nashville, go see music row, but remember music row is actually two rows, and they're ONE WAYS!! Pretty cool though, just walking down it is nice. 

Also go to cummings falls, it's pretty nice, but I'm sure a lot of places have nice parks too. The main cities to see in this state to know it are: Nashville(of course) Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. The rest is suburban, or country. But each city has it's own personality, so it's important to see each one to really know Tennessee."
47731,South Dakota. If you like nature and the outdoors it's an amazing and relatively cheap place to visit. There's also Mt. Rushmore and the Crazy Horse memorial as well as various national parks and national forests.
47732,North Dakota has some solid....corn?

47734,"If you're taking your calc classes in a university also double check if they allow calculators. I know UCF doesn't because of people storing information. Otherwise I just use websites such as desmos, derivitive-calculator, and integral-calculator (sometimes symbolab)."
47735,"This.  We definitely were only permitted to use 4-function calculators in school for calculus, can't remember if that was a rule for Algebra and trig as well, but it might have been.  My experience with calculators that actually could perform calculus problems didn't provide enough, if any at all, of the line by line solutions that you'll need to show be able to show your work.  

There's plenty of info online, and I'm pretty sure that I've even seen some apps that will allow you to just take a picture of the problem, and it'll spit out the solution. That would have been a game changer for me looking back on my experience touring calculus.  

If I had any advice about learning calculus tho, it would be to learn and memorize the Unit Circle.  Unit Circle is life."
47736,When I took math you weren't allowed any calculator. All answers were either symbolic or exact. Undergrad math if that matters.

47741,"Either of the calculators linked by u/ PeanutTheFerret should work fine, but _don't_ get the TI-84 CE you linked. The colors look nice, but it uses the same Z80 chip as the original ti-84, and the color calculations bog it down a lot.

(Edit: I'm wrong about this, see the thread below. The CE should be fine)

If you're looking for something inexpensive, go with a regular ti-84. If you want something fancier, the nspire series is nice, if a bit overkill of a calculus class."
47742,"I love my TI-84 Plus CE. I also own a regular TI-84 Plus, and I'd gladly take the CE over it, even though it costs marginally more. It doesn't cost much more, but it's significantly slimmer, easier to read, and is rechargeable with a battery indicator so I never have to worry about it dying during an important exam.

However, the Nspire is certainly the more powerful calculator, and it's about the same cost."
47743,"Maybe TI has changed their manufacturing process, but the last time I checked it's the same chip in the CE as the 84 plus, so as a result the CE experiences performance issues.

That said, I havent done any serious research into graphing calculators in about 4 years."
47744,"the 84 plus CE is different from the TI 84 plus C silver.  the silver is a piece of garbage.  that's the one that was a regular 84 with a color screen.  slow, clunky, just a big pile of nope.  not too long after that was released they released the 84 plus CE.  the CE is magical.  rechargeable, fast, just plain lovely.  

i know because i bought the 84 c silver, only to see the 84 CE come out like 6 months later.  it's been almost 5 years and i'm still pissed about that."

If you're looking for something lightweight, we recommend the **TI-36X**. It does some calculus (no CAS), but lacks graphing.

If you're looking for something full-blown, go for the **TI CX CAS**\- its got symbolic calculus and graphing. Its costly, but powerful. Also, be aware, if you are in high school, you will not be able to use this on the ACT.

&#x200B;

For something online, we recommend **SymboLab** [https://www.symbolab.com/](https://www.symbolab.com/). The free version can solve almost anything CAS related (probably better than TI), and the paid version will also show you steps. Obviously though, you won't be able to use this on tests/quizzes.

&#x200B;

For something online that you can use on tests / quizzes, check out our app, **ClassCalc**. Its got a powerful graphing calculator as well as a strong CAS component. Also, with your teachers permission, you can use it in class. It has a non-invasive management layer that will allow a teacher to make sure you're not cheating etc during tests. You can check out a mini tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR08DXHvtGw&t=2s&list=PLZbP7IPhnt3jFY2xean-hmT\_CmnL\_DdB6&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR08DXHvtGw&t=2s&list=PLZbP7IPhnt3jFY2xean-hmT_CmnL_DdB6&index=2).

Note: Currently the app is free, so there's no cost to trying it. We just ask for honest feedback!

---

Make sure your school allows graphing calculator on exams before buying one!
---

Check with your instructor.  As much as Texas Instruments pushes their graphing calculators, my school (a community college that bases their course requirements on local 4-year schools) doesn't allow graphing calculators on exams **at all*.  That's for Algebra 1, 2, Pre-Calc, Calc 1, 2, and 3, and I'm told even Differential Equations.  [Here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K/) of a non-graphing, scientific calculator that's allowed in all classes and exams.  (Except for my Chem 101 class which for some reason only allows [this disaster of a calculator](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-TI-30Xa-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B00000JBNS/).)  Note that a [very similar but slightly more advanced version](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-Engineering-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B004NBZB2Y/) of the first one I linked was explicitly *not* allowed by two instructors because of the poly-solv and sys-solv functions, though this appears to vary by instructor."
47776,"GeoGebra. I'd choose GeoGebra 5 (it has an older UI but better functionality). It's a computer program which is really handy. It has a CAS solver (solves higher degree equations, equation systems and also integrates and derivates), it plots functions and equations and has a quite nice graphing portion. The graphing lets you put things like points on a plane, then put the lines that go through that point, then you can get the lines between the points, then you can make a circle that has a tangent that goes through that very same point, and it's all really nice. It also lets you make ""sliders"" that let contstants in equations vary. I know that sound a bit weird, but lets say you have a line y=3x+a, and a circle (y-3)^2 +(x-7)^2 =0 and you want to find out for what values on a the line lies tangent to the circle. Then you can just make a slider for a, and then test answers. Your math professor probably won't accept them as answers, but it's an excellent way of testing your answer. Oh and you can graph multivariable functions eg. f(x,y) in 3D-space and draw shapes in 3D-space, which I found very helpful as I really need visual help when I'm solving harder questions. 

I know this was a bit of a ramble, but i really like GeoGebra and it has helped me a lot."
47777,"The best calculator for any actual mathematics course is no calculator.  As with any rule, of course, there are exceptions, but I don't see a calculus course as one of them.

If your course requires it, then do what's required but avoid any other use.  Hopefully the course is well enough designed that the calculator actually helps.  However I believe this to be a rare occurrence.  The thing will become a crutch and a distraction.  It will allow you the illusion of knowledge while keeping you from it.  For example you don't learn to construct graphs and understand the behavior of functions by looking at graphs that have been constructed for you.  If you construct them then check out your result with the calculator, that can be very useful, but few students will discipline themselves to this sort of appropriate use.

Once you've mastered the material, it can be very rewarding to do further explorations with the technology."
47778,"The TI-84 CE is a Godsend, at least for me. The best calculator I've ever owned. I'd  come undone if anything ever happened to it."
47779,Get the regular TI-84
47780,"Get just a simple Casio fx-82 II or similar. You don't want an over reliance on a calculator. When I was in HS we had such a reliance on the graphing calculators that I learnt nothing. I went on to fix my mathematical education a few years later to go into uni and I see all the engineering students in my first year mathematics classes not knowing wtf they're doing because they have come straight out of HS with that calculator reliance. If you ever need to really use graphing tools and paper and pen won't cut it, go for symbol lab or desmos.

Good luck"
47781,Fx 991 es plus epic calculator it actually does different and integration and is allowed in most unis
47782,No love for the TI-86?!
47783,"Nope. Nspire Calculator is too much for calculus. Way too complicated to calculate a simple problem that probably can be done faster by hand. Honestly, ti-36x pro is good enough.

I would suggest using a basic scientific calculator  and work problems out by hand so you can better prepare for exams. Calculators are usually not allowed on exams, at least it was for my class. 

Unless you are planning on taking statistics, or Linear Algebra, you don’t really need any fancy graphing calculator."
47784,"Others have said it, but make sure you can even have a calculator. I’m at the University of Illinois right now and they don’t allow calculators of any kind, even basic four-function ones. You are expected to be able to do arithmetic in your head or by writing it out. The math department considers the use of any kind of calculator whether in class, or at home (including online ones like desmos, symbolab, or Wolfram) to be cheating.

Honestly, my advice is to ask yourself if you really need a calculator — and if you do, are you ready to even take calculus?"
47786,"you're a jerk, but i get it.  my calc prof wouldn't let any of his classes calculators at all.  i think i was better for it.  but he also made sure everything had friendly numbers and accepted the square root of 17 as a perfectly good answer."

47790,Typically in classes you aren’t allowed to use your phone
47791,Even if I could use my phone I don’t want to. No thanks.
47792,Wacky. What about a generic disconnected tablet? Those calculators are outrageously expensive.
47793,Probably not. You can usually get those crazy calculators fairly discounted. Try craigslist or any resale sites or apps
47794,"Oh, I don't need one, thanks. It's just weird to me that these relics are perpetuated by current educational practices."
47795,"Yeah TI has a virtual monopoly on the industry (most US teachers of secondary school only teach on TIs). As a result, they haven't lowered the price   in years despite offering the same calcualtor (as far as functionality goes)."
47797,"Instructors won't allow phones, tablets, or almost anything they don't explicitly recognize (and many things they do) because you can install things on them that allow you to cheat.  Even smartwatches aren't allowed because some people have figured out how to cheat using them.  (I don't know if it was via apps or just putting answers into images and displaying them.)  If it isn't an approved device, you often won't be allowed to use it.  It's even more strict in testing centers.  I can't even bring a *ruler* or my own graph paper into the testing center."
47798,"I have the Ti-89 Titanium and it's fantastic. It made Calc 1 and 2 easier. It's great for Calc 3, because you can change between rectangular, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems easily. It's also capable of just about any integral (provided it's even solvable in the first place), partial derivatives, 3D graphs, some differential equations, and implicit differentiation. The button layout isn't too great, and input is intuitive (It's very similar to Mathematica and MATLAB). If you're going into electrical engineering, there's even a spot in the calculator specifically for EE related things, like Fourier transforms, impedance, etc.

Go ahead and take your sister's Ti-84 though. Some professors in college do not allow the Ti-89 or similar on tests (or sometimes no calculator at all), because of just how good it is. I think it's also the only calculator you cannot use on the ACT if that means anything. I got a used one on ebay for $76 a few years ago, and it was like brand new, so I essentially got it for half off."
47799,"I have both the Ti-84 and the CAS, and I didn’t buy the CAS until senior year of college. (I graduated in May with a chemistry degree from the college of engineering at my university.) I would say that which calculator you need is based on how the tests are structured - none of my calculus tests were taken with a calculator, and I ended up buying the CAS for my P Chem classes."
47800,Don’t use a calculator. Gaussian elimination.
47801,"Imo don’t waste the money. Use tools for your phone/pc which will do a better job and stick to a scientific calculator. A lot of college courses won’t let you use graphing calculators on tests. So far I’ve had one class in two years who would allow one. 

Casio has a ~$15 scientific calculator with natural display, nonCAS equation solvers, with solve vector math, systems, definite integration/differentiation, etc. great calculator allowed on pretty much all standardized testing. Also runs on solar and is smaller in size as an added bonus.

47802,"Calculators arent allowed in college calculus and beyond. Graphing calculators are a waste of money and a assle with batteries and the learning curve. Download a free graphing app on your phone, since it won't have much of a learning curve. Get yourself a cheap tablet, instead, in case you decide to pirate textbooks or want an on the go pdf reader

Or an external terabyte harddrive"
47803,Not necessarily. At my university it’s actually a co requisite to know how to use a CAS calculator
47804,"I guess there's some potential for some cool stuff there, but the clculators themselves are frustrating and expensive little gizmos. Especially considering that such things can and are easily emulated on computer and on phones for free. Do you happen to know the reason why? Is it for specialty equipment training?"
47805,"I don’t know the reason why. Maybe it’s just to get the pass rate of Calc 1 and Calc 2 as high as possible? Because Calc 2 is a huge bottleneck for so many majors and the fail rate is quite high. 

So maybe it’s just so the students all have a tool at their disposal that can help them pass. 🤷‍♂️"
47806,"Yknow, the only thing I can think of in calc that requires machine calculation, beyond of course MatLab projects, is things like series expansion or linear approximation, where you will be given numbers as decimals instead"
47807,"Huh. Oh well. Here’s the course. As you can see at the bottom it wants you to know how to use a CAS system. And actually to get a math degree here, you have to take Math 1200 which is a class that teaches you how to use a CAS system

https://catalog.weber.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=12&coid=49406&print"
47809,You’re probably right about not finding much use after graduation. That’s kinda the way of calculators. I just view the the price tag like a reusable textbook because I’m supposed to need it for 3 classes
47810,Thats not the way of calculators. Most quantitative professionals use scientific calculators every day.
47811,"I wish thiswas the casex unfortunately not in my experience at 3 different universities, for tests a physical calculator is often allowed."
47812,"The TI-84 Plus is the standard graphing calculator recommended/required by most US universities and it’s permitted on the AP, ACT, and SAT exams (among others). Some school districts are switching to Desmos.com because it is available online for free and it is becoming allowed, and even embedded, on some standardized exams, but the TI-84 Plus is still the standard.

As others have stated, many texts are written with the belief that you have a TI-84 Plus calculator. What many people don’t realize is that this isn’t by accident. In fact, it is why TI has a near monopoly on the high end calculator market. TI offered free courses for educators to learn how to use their calculators and paid publishers to include instructions on how to complete mathematical problems using their calculators in math textbooks. As time passed, educators (teachers) knew how to instruct students on how to complete the task in TI calculators, but not other brands. To simplify and standardize the teaching process, schools started requiring TI calculators. It was just easier to use what the teachers already knew and not have to spend time teaching students how to use several different calculators. Now TI has a practical monopoly on the calculator market for secondary and post-secondary education.

Desmos, and to a lesser degree, GeoGebra, are making in-roads on TI’s monopoly by offering free, powerful, open-source online calculators and Pearson, one of the largest textbook publishers in the US, has begun to include instructions on using Desmos in their texts."
47813,any cheap scientific calculator will do.
47814,"Yeah that's a good calculator. If you're allowed to use a graphing calculator like a TI-83 or TI-84, then get one of those, but otherwise a TI-30X is fine. I've gone through a whole math degree with just one of those."
47816,"TI-84 is the go-to calculator.   
if you want something on your phone or pc there is also wolframAlpha or desmos(phone app is nice)"
47817,"Get a graphing calculator if your school allows it (TI-84 or similar). Our school didn't allow calculators for any Calc classes but having it outside the class (or substituting it with Wolfram Alpha/ Matlab/Maple) helped a lot to verify limits, graphs, etc."
47818,Does buying the calculator offer any advantage over the free alternatives?
47819,"You can use a graphing calculator on the AP exams, and for the AP Calculus exams, you *must*."
47820,"AP calculus exams allow you to use calculators that do calculus, counter-intuitively enough

https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies"
47821,"Sometimes, it's hard enough to just figure out how to set up the integral, and graphing calculators also allow integrals of integrands with non-elementary antiderivatives (that don't yield to some special techniques) to be easily estimated."
47822,Python
47823,"If you intend to take the AP Calculus exam (either AB or BC), you will *need* to use a graphing calculator from the list that /u/yes_its_him linked to; for the other math-heavy exams, a graphing calculator is permitted, so it's best to get one for all of them (although the College Board will allow you to bring up to two calculators to the exam, maybe in case one goes bad).

I used a TI-89, which I enjoyed because of its ability to draw 3D graphs (2002, before I had regular access to the Internet), but one of the cheaper graphing calculators should work fine; I recommend becoming intimately familiar with that calculator, specifically with its syntax for integrals and elementary functions."
47824,"If you need graphing capability, TI-84 is a great calculator. If you don't need graphing, what you have is perfect. I personally prefer the Casio fx-115es that got me through college and courses like numerical analysis and courses where a lot of data had to be computed. Big shoutout to my Casio who with 5 dead pixels is still pushing through with me."

SAME! I don't really understand it. Multivariable graphing is not *that* esoteric in the scheme of things, we are hardly the first to have wanted to do it. So why are there not more offerings, even outside of the free realm?

The best thing I've found thus far is [Quick Graph](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-graph/id292412367), which isn't *bad*, but the user experience just isn't as seamless as with Desmos, nor do the input capabilities seem as flexible, and I find it a bit difficult to precisely rotate my functions. It's got great reviews though, so maybe I just need to spend more time with it.

That said, the nspire is stupid fast compared to the Ti89 for more complex calc functions."
47838,"Most math classes (Calc 2 and up is what I took) don't allow calculators.  If they do, they'll be 4 function ones that can at most do inverse trig functions.

47846,I had a TI-89 and it worked fine for all the classes I took
47847,I bought an HP48GX back in the 90s when I was a freshman. I still use it regularly.
47848,A real engineering calculator.  RPN FTW.
47849,"I didn't get used to using RPN until after I graduated, but I still remember Brewer's rants: ""You may use any calculator you wish on the exam, but as far as I know, there's only one company that makes real calculators, and it's not Oklahoma Instruments. It's HP""

OP: friggin' hate parantheses and memory registers? get an HP."
47851,"I don't think any upper level math classes require calculators at all, but I've had a calc class where graphing calculators (mostly for manipulating matrices) helped."
47852,"I just finished my freshmen year at Tech. Neither maths I took allowed calculator (integral calculus and linear algebra), and physics 1 (classical) exams only allowed ones that COULD NOT STORE TEXT (to prevent cheating). So rather than buy a new one, I used my good old TI-32 from middle school. I believe there are better options.

I also used my TI-84 CE on homework and other calculations that I needed to do. (I worked faster with the 84, so I used that on physics homework.... and also on linear occasionally if I was desperate to finish quick)"
47853,"I still run my TI-83 Plus. That thing is P.O.S. but it's gotten me this far. If I ever need to do something more serious calculations (and I've never need to on a test), I use matlab."
47854,"Casio fx-9860GII

It's graph based. Will give you HUGE advantage over other calculators once you are used to it. 

Also since not many people use it you are almost always allowed to bring it into any kind of testing or exam (ACT, calc/physics final.. etc) because nobody knows what its capabilities are (except for you)."
47855,MATLAB 😅😅😅
47856,"TI83. It's all you need or are allowed for any tests, and on homework there's Wolfram alpha and matlab"
47857,"TI-89 all the way. Solves systems of equations, differential equations, systems of differential equations, calculates limits, derivatives, definite integrals, indefinite integrals, matrix products, vector functions, graphs in 2D and 3D, and has any extra apps you could ever need for statistics, finance, engineering, etc. It also has crazy battery life and a massive catalog of any function you could think of (http://tibasic.wikia.com/wiki/Catalog_(89)). It can do pretty much anything you want."
47858,DOES NOT EXIST!
47859,"I don't attend GaTech, so I don't know if any calculators aren't allowed in classes. If all calculators are permitted, I highly recommend the TI-Nspire CX **CAS**. That shit has everything in it. It is extremely helpful and you can easily check what equations or matrices did you enter. Plus, it works quite nicely when you use a lot of variables."
47860,"When I was at tech, my ti nspire was not allowed for math classes (or most math based classes for that matter).  Most people bring a TI-89 and a basic calculator for calc tests"
47861,"probably a ti-84, I also took Calc AB and BC in high school and colleges are not gonna teach you how to use functions on your calculator, I used a ti-89 for those two years in high school so use the one you've been using forever and get the same exact model for the ti-84"
47862,Yea I went ahead and picked up a ti84 just now. I actually got a ti89 first but after playing with it a bit it was a bit overwhelming learning all of the new stuff about the calculator so I just went back to what I'm used to which is the ti84
47863,"You should probably have a graphing calculator, a finance calculator...and a regular scientific. Just don't bring them to class."
47864,"Having completed a multivariable calculus class already, I'd say the ti-84 is all you need. I haven't taken linear algebra, though."
47865,"You should be comfortable leaving all calculators behind, because you will not be able to use them at all. The calculations do not test your ability to do basic operations on big/ugly numbers anymore, they test your ability to answer the question by understanding it.

Linear Algebra: easy, you will be dealing with numbers no bigger than probably the 12x12 multiplication table. Know vector functionalities, dot product, cross product, their meaning. Is easy class!

Calculus Multivariable: level sets, be able to visualize graphs helps a lot. Here you can use programs to help you draw functions in R^3 and higher."
47866,"The reason why I'm asking is because in high school, I took calculus AB and BC which made me use the calculator for tons of things. Like I had word problems that required the use of the calculator to do an integral or derivative that would be impossible/way too tedious to do by hand.

So I wont be having those types of problems in multivariable calculus?"
47867,"I have ti calculator but mostly used to check graphs. In multivariable lot of graph are 3d and the only way to get them nicely is using math programs to graph for you, otherwise you draw them as level sets, compressed onto two dimension.

But if you can, getting that calculator is always nice because for modeling more complex graph later on then it is always nice to have extra tool. Just nowadays so many graphing technologies online. But I have color Ti so it is very nice sometimes haha."
47868,"Hey, I'm currently 8 out of 12 weeks through multivariate calculus. I've very rarely had to pull out my calculator while in lectures or on set assignments unless I want a decimal answer. Most answers are given as surds, or fractions, which can be computed with some mental gymnastics if you're comfortable and competent.

Here's a link to the [solutions to one of the assignments](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0ODrSDolTFTMDRsVVJ5MFJ4YkE). Scroll through and look at the final answers.

But still, have a calculator on you. There will be times when you'll want it and need it."
47869,I recommend using Mathematica for graphing in calc 3.  Physics 2 won't need anything beyond your ti83.
47870,Obligatory TI Nspire CAS post.
47871,"Casio is great if you're studying to become an engineer. They have a non graphing one that you can calculate vectors, unit vectors, magnitude, etc. I don't know which one off the top of my head"
47872,"This isn't exactly a website/app, it's still Desmos, but jerks like me have been forcing the calculator into 3D with a few linear algebra tricks. Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a 3D vector field in Desmos. Graph contains a link to my website where you can explore the AP Calculus BC or Multivariable Calculus page if you're looking for something else.

 [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zs5g3u5r7s](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zs5g3u5r7s)"
47873,"i think it’s insane when people make 3d stuff in desmos. this isn’t exactly what i was looking for, but it’s still really cool."
47874,"I'm biased because I'm the creator of such an app, so I won't recommend my own. Here's one, though, that works very well and runs in the browser: https://www.monroecc.edu/faculty/paulseeburger/calcnsf/CalcPlot3D/

Somebody else mentioned geogebra which is very powerful but has a bit of a learning curve."
47875,What’s your app?
47876,"spent so long only looking at desmos graphs that i was looking for the perspective point for a solid 10 seconds lol, good site but i want to see yours :)"
47877,"If you have an apple computer, there’s an app called Grapher that works pretty well."
47878,Geogbra 3D might do the trick
47879,"[https://www.math3d.org](https://www.math3d.org/) Nothing yet is as elegant as desmos, but this might do the trick for you"
47880,Seems like duplicate of https://www.reddit.com/r/MathHelp/comments/41ddi9/looking_for_a_3d_graphing_calculator_similar_to/
47881,"Yea, I wasn't sure of which subreddit to post it on"
47882,I see grey everywhere.
47883,"A very underrated colour.  The amount of times I suggest grey and people turn their nose up just because grey is associated with being boring.  It looks very good in offices and in domestic settings, is calming, and provides a perfect background for something in front of it, such as art placed on the wall or a plant next to it."
47884,"I wanted to paint my baby's room grey. I thought it would be a perfect neutral and would allow me to change the decor to nearly whatever I wanted if I got bored. Husband said that it's ""weird"" and ""sad"" to paint a baby's room grey... Ok, valspar ballet slippers it is then! I still wish we did grey and let her decide when she's older that color she liked best. Meh, I personally live pink so it's all good."
47885,I think grey would awesome with pink accents in the room!
47886,I’m doing grey for our nursery. Light pinks and blues make me cringe. Babies deserve class.
47887,My whole place is a warm grey. Grey has cool and warm undertones and varies greatly. Would recommend grabbing some sample warm Grey pots and showing him
47889,I did dolphin gray from Behr which has these qualities.
47890,"We did gray on our daughter's room and decorated with decals and I personally think it came out great. That said, I heard non-stop from my mother about how terrible it would be to have gray on the baby's room. After she saw the finished room, decorated, she finally relented. Sheesh."
47891,I did a similar pink for my kids nursery a few years ago but the focal wall with the crib in from of it was a dark grey. It looked incredible with the white crib in front of it and it wasn't too overpowering like I think an all grey room would've been.
47892,"Yes! And one can easily tone the grey to be lighter/darker, colder/warmer to what is needed for the room"
47893,Where do you live where people don't want grey!
47894,"I live in the pacific northwest where skies are grey most of the time, it rains, and it's so far north there isn't much daylight in winter. I don't need that on the inside too."
47895,Question! We are moving to a similarly gray city and don’t want to paint all of our walls gray either. Any non-gray colors that you see people using a lot in your area?
47896,People are so obsessed with this color lately. I'm kind of sick of it.
47897,"We have grey, whites and light pinks. All very neutral and it’s easy to change the main colour theme by changing accessories like curtains, cushions etc"
47898,Everyone wants chic white everything.. also pale pinks and greens are in as well. Pinterest has lots of inspiration if you need some
47899,So.... The 90s are back.
47900,These people are wrong about bold colors. Grey has the most mass appeal now. Like it or hate it greys and whites are in.
47901,"They're useful colours for displaying artwork. In a rental they're the best colours, as you can personalise your home without painting or wallpapering. The versatility is their main appeal, along with white bringing light into small windowed apartments."
47902,It’s the HGTV effect :(
47903,Christina and Tarek were famous for this on literally all their renos.
47904,"Pale blush pink, jewel tones, (mostly emerald green, like they mentioned) slate Grey, pastels to a lesser extent.
Edit: didn't notice the word ""wall"" in the post at first. haha Just consider this my input on accent walls and we're good. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
47905,I made my cabinets slate grey with silver knobs & poplar wood countertops! Poplar has great neutral grey tones in it + it's totally cheap & quick to build countertops with.
47906,Do you have a picture?
47907,"I have an imgur link! https://imgur.com/gallery/tQtIBXZ
Sorry for the mess."
47908,Reminds me of the inside of a battleship I toured when I was younger. :P
47909,"Dope! I really like Art Deco and modern, post modern type stuffs. The structure is a 1962 compact ranch style brick build & I wanted to keep the idea. Should I ever find myself aboard such a vessel, I'd call it home."
47910,I love the chopping block counter!!
47911,Thank you! It was super easy to make & I infused the the terpinoid into the wood&finish so that the smell comes out when heated!
47912,"Thanks, I do like the counter tops and gray combo."
47913,I *just* ordered that same coffee table a couple of days ago! How do you like it?
47914,It stays clean & doesn't easily scuff! It also assembled in 5 minutes!
47915,love slate Grey!
47916,Pale pink and emerald green were my bedroom colors as a kid in the 90s....oh lord.
47917,The deep green trend is coming back
47918,Am on this bandwagon. Along with the dark blues.
47919,Knoxville gray is my current favorite dark green and I am painting everything with it!
47920,"I painting my tall vaulted ceiling Knoxville grey! It’s beautiful, looks like a forest canopy."
47921,"Ive been using a muted forest for 5 years now on everything. Flips sold easily, apartments rent quickly. Im pleased with not having to use gray. It also allows for white trims and wood trims in the same space without any real clash, which is cool for rehabbing."
47922,I'm personally not a fan but I am starting to see more of it
47923,"* Kendall charcoal - Benjamin Moore 
* Museum Piece -Benjamin Moore 
* simply white - Benjamin Moore 
* cedar key  - Benjamin Moore
* Chantilly lace - Benjamin Moore
* Decorators White - Benjamin Moore"
47924,"Benjamin Moore is often the industry go to brand for the average American builder co., after Sherwin Williams. In my observation, Behr Marquee is coming in hot. It's been the bees knees since it's debut & is a cheaper literal comparable product. I've used it as a cost savings option for clients a few times."
47925,We have always used Behr. I decided to try Sherwin Williams recently when we redid our bedroom (Downing Straw). Never.again!  I will be returning to my beloved Behr for my next project.
47926,I feel like the folks at Behr have a better working color & luma(lux?) theory than most American brands I'm aware of. Every wall in my house looks like the color I chose under every lighting condition!
