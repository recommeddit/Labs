46569,Wtf that‚Äôs the best candy on here
46570,"Swedish Fish taste like chemicals and disappointment, IMO. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
46571,"They're cherry flavored, which is like the worst fruit flavor. Also the texture sucks."
46572,"I call bullshit on this. Fuck no, with this Jolly Rancher bullshit."
46573,I live in TN and don‚Äôt even know a RedHot is
46574,My ass if Utah is Peanut Butter M&M's
46575,"I dunno about how accurate this guide is.

But I tried PB M&Ms a few weeks ago and can confirm it's the best gosh darn candy in the land."
46576,Right?
46577,"Kinda wish I lived in Wisconsin now, Pretzel MnMs are my jam but I rarely ever find them"
46578,I love me pretzel m&ms but I've been having a hard time finding them myself. As a Wisconsin resident I feel like everyone else is hiding them from me.
46579,OMG pretzel M&Ms are always the first off the shelves in Wisconsin it's a bitch to find them
46580,"Don‚Äôt worry, I can‚Äôt find them in Wisconsin either."
46581,M&Ms totally makes sense in states where it‚Äôs likely to be toasty warm during Halloween
46582,Milk duds can suck my cock and balls and nuts.
46583,Not one of the ingredients you listed is actually in a Milk Dud.
46584,That you're aware of...
46585,"Balls AND nuts? And they're both plural, implying that you have at least two of each.  But how do you tell your balls and your nuts apart?"
46586,"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don‚Äôt"
46587,"Well this confirms there‚Äôs no reason for North Dakota, Nebraska, or Oklahoma to exist... yanasty"
46588,You should add Tennessee to that list.
46589,Ummm as a person from Tennessee who has spent many a Halloween collecting loads and loads of candy I can confidently say that while we may be googling Red Hots (which I honestly have zero explanation for) we are not placing them in our Candy Bowls...who the fuck wants RedHots as Halloween Candy?
46590,"Right? This obviously didn't control for outliers. There's got to be one particular neighborhood of elderly people, who are all convinced of the spiritual significance of Red Hots upon the youths, and so we get branded with this nonsense."
46591,Yeah there's something seriously wrong with this data lol
46592,"Live in Oklahoma and find it hard to believe Hot Tamales are the most popular. Them + Red Hots and Mars bars (Snickers Almond?) are like the only candies I dislike out of the bunch (don't like hot stuff, don't like almonds)."
46593,Evidence that the south is better
46594,Milk duds gang rise up
46595,C‚Äômon KY. Swedish fish? I know we‚Äôre backwards but damn.
46597,I second that Reece‚Äôs for Michigan.. always been my favorite..
46598,"Oklahoman here. 

Literally no idea how this is the case, I know no one who goes out of their way to buy friggin hot tamales"
46599,There‚Äôs no way Mars trumps Hershey in PA. You lie
46600,"So Pennsylvania, who has a theme park Named after the Hershey company is a mars State? Bullshit.
Illinois has Ferrara pan AND the mars factory. 
Again bullshit. 
Something is Swedish fishy about this map."
46601,I didn't think they even really sold mars bars in US stores
46602,"I'm not convinced Mars bars actually exist. I'm an American in my 30s and I've never seen one, not even a wrapper. Part of me kind of believes it's some elaborate prank, but I'm not sure who the intended target is."
46603,From Ohio and never seen or heard of Mars.
46604,"Who the hell still eats Mars Bars? What is this, 1971?"
46605,I swear all these are completely made up
46606,"Surrounded by M&M‚Äôs and Reese‚Äôs, and I get stuck with Jolly Ranchers...."
46607,Right? Gimme some chocolate!
46608,Where the fuck is Twix?!?
46609,"How the fuck is a Mars Bar *anyone's* ""favorite"" candy?

I mean, it's all right, as far as candy bars go, but it's just a step up from a Milky Way, and *no one* intentionally buys that shit. Every Milky Way I've ever had has been as the last picked items in a variety bag."
46610,"I have a new respect for Wisconsin, Kentucky and surprisingly Utah."
46611,Came here to say that about Kentucky. What an odd feeling
46612,Well no matter how many  ‚Äúhaha Kentucky is racist‚Äù lines there are theres no denying the glory of Swedish Fish
46613,I'm not proud to live in a Milk Dud state but at least it's not Swedish Fish lmao
46614,"Not moving to South Dakota, then."
46615,"We just can't do anything right in Nebraska, can we?"
46616,I refused to believe my state‚Äôs favorite Halloween candy is frickin Milk Duds...
46617,Utah; always has to be just a little bit different
46618,When will Goobers get the recognition it deserves?!
46619,The beauty is in their simplicity.
46620,This guide is to show people what not to buy since kids are getting enough of it from others
46621,"Great info! Due to circumstances out of my control ive had to move several times in the past year at least 500 to 2500 feet away from a school, so as you can imagine giving out candy to my new friends is always a struggle. But thanks to this cool guide I'll be able to find out what the best snacks to offer to my sleep over friends!"
46622,Well Snickers for Georgia is right. It's also the most common candy for Easter. Neither my kid or I like them and we end up picking them out into a big pile of Snickers that only mom eats when she gets really desperate for some chocolate.
46623,I've lived in IL most of my life and I'd have guessed Reeses. I wouldn't have put Jolly Ranchers in the top 10. I would have thought even gross-ass Smarties were higher in sales.
46624,Actually the most popular? Or the most purchased because it was on sale?
46625,Oklahoma is truly a godless place.
46626,Fuck sweetarts
46627,"Oklahoman here.
I call bullshit on hot tamales, totally gross."
46628,I like them but I would think Snickers would be represented more.
46629,Completely reasonable.
46630,"Yeah, Oklahoman as well. I call bs also, Hot Tamales are nasty."
46631,"Kentucky, WTF are you doing?"
46632,"Statistically speaking, Reese‚Äôs are the best. And they totally are."
46633,Seriously Kentucky?
46634,For shame Louisiana. For shame...
46635,Alvin Kamara
46636,A state where hot tamales is the most popular Halloween candy is a state I don‚Äôt want to live in
46637,"Fucking lies! It‚Äôs peanut butter cups in every state. Come on kids, am I right?!?!"
46638,I need to move to Colorado
46639,Arent these all pretty much made by the same company? How do we know this isnt just an advertisement?
46640,Anything that isn't Reese's is just wrong tbh
46641,no fucking way it's Mars in Ohio. I haven't seen a Mars bar here in my entire fucking life
46642,Ohioan: *googles ‚Äúwhat the fuck is a mars bar?‚Äù
46643,"Ive always thought ""candy"" is exclusively for non-chocolate sweets. I wonder if its because I grew up in Australia and New Zealand"
46644,"California and Connecticut are wrong. 

You can't even get Nestle Kit Kats in the US, only Hersey Kit Kats."
46645,Nobody took a survey.
46646,"We've kept detailed stats on which candy is preferred by trick-or-treaters over the past 4 years / 3 houses, and the burn curves are clear. When given a choice of a variety of name-brand full-size candy bars, kids prefer plain Hershey bars. These always go first, no matter where we're living or what other candy options are available."
46647,Lol I don't know who reaches for the milk duds before the reese's cups.
46648,You know the south is inbred because of the amount of states that picked fucking milk duds instead of any non-cement based candy.
46649,"I'm surprised by the gummy worms. I didnt think they came in ""fun size"""
46650,They are the inchworm variety.
46651,I live in montana and its not the favorite candy its just the cheap stuff everyone gives out for everything... And i mean everything....
46652,"Whoop whoop! SD repping it weird again! Born and raised, helluva fishbowl kinda place."
46653,Milk Duds?! Fucking ick
46654,Milk duds... Nooooo
46655,Louisiana here..... sounds about right.
46656,I honestly don‚Äôt see many people eat redhots
46657,What maniacs want hot tamales??
46658,Is this by purchase? Or by opinion poll?
46659,Perhaps I'm a bit biased but no love for Hershey's??
46660,You should try soap first...
46661,"You were supposed to but hand sanitizer on the feces, that's where all the germs are."
46662,you got aids
46663,"Wash your hands man, hand sanitizer isn't supposed to remove dirt, grime or poop- its supposed to kill germs and bacteria. That's what soap is for and it's 100% necessary to remove any kind of visable soil."
46664,soap and water. soap and water.
46665,"i think it does remove the bacteria out of the feces. the feces is probably safe for human consumption, enjoy! ;)"
46666,underrated post
46667,I'm crying in my kitchen at 2 am laughing at this
46669,"I have 2 children in elementary school, and their school supply list both sat hand sanitizer, Germ X brand only. I can‚Äôt find any hand sanitizer, much less germ x brand. Also can‚Äôt find the Lysol wipes or spray that they are asking for."
46670,Costco has GermX gallon sized bottles for $15. I think it‚Äôs limited to 1/customer
46671,"Sadly, I don‚Äôt have a Costco where I live! We have a Sam‚Äôs Club, but they haven‚Äôt had any either."
46672,mothercucker what aisle?! I keep missing that shit
46673,Idk of all Costco layouts are similar but for me it‚Äôs right at back where they have pet food and cleaning supplies. I‚Äôm kicking myself for buying the more expensive bottle last month. It was $25 for a gallon sized bottle and was off brand but had 80% alcohol content. GermX seemed like a better deal for $15 even if it doesn‚Äôt have the pump
46674,I always go through there and never have seen it. I'll look extra close next time. thank you for sharing!
46675,"Mine had them immediately inside the front door last week. Tons of hand sanitizer, but no cleaning products."
46676,"They're trying to do in-person classes?  I know that it makes learning more effective, but the price will probably be too high to be worth it."
46677,"Yes, I have a 2nd grader,4th grader, and 10th grader. The 2 younger ones are going 5 days a week, and the 10th grader will go 2 days one week and 3 days the next. They are requiring the 4th and 10th grader to wear masks, but not the 2nd grader. It‚Äôs going to be an absolute mess."
46678,There's nothing to say about all that except a big yikes.  I hope you all get through this mess unscathed.
46679,"My son is heading into grade 5. He's autistic and has high anxiety over COVID-19 and wearing a mask is difficult for him, especially for a full day at school, which at the moment is what our school has planned. I'm in Canada in an area with a low number of cases but I predict schools will close by November if not sooner."
46680,"I think they will close also. I just don‚Äôt see how they will be able to stay open because someone, whether a student or teacher, is either going to get it or come in contact with someone who has it. 
It is difficult to wear them for a long period of time. I don‚Äôt really expect a bunch of 8 - 10 year olds to wear them for 7+ hours."
46681,"I work with kids on the spectrum and for my clients, there is only one that can/will wear a mask for more than 5 minutes. Obviously the whole country is a mess right now and I shouldn't be surprised but there seems to be absolutely no consideration or planning being done here in the US (PNW) for kids with disabilities. If my clients didn't have the insurance or money to pay for extra services or respite care they would be completely screwed."
46682,Agreed. In person classes en masse right now is insanity.
46683,"Not to change the topic too much, but when did we normalize kids (aka families) being responsible for cleaning supplies?"
46684,I think when the schools stopped supplying it and forcing the teachers to buy it out of their own money. It‚Äôs pretty shitty in my opinion. I don‚Äôt mind doing it for the teachers. They shouldn‚Äôt have to provide that out of their own salary.
46685,"Do you have any Distillers around?  


We have some here in Utah producing Hand Sanitizer and you know its safe, because they make alcoholic beverages."
46686,"Can't find sanitizer? Even now? In Canada we had a shortage during the initial panic run in March and April, but by May the stores were flooded with sanitizer. You could fill swimming pools with the hand sanitizer they sell at stores here.

Is the USA really going that third world?"
46687,I can‚Äôt find legit hand sanitizer. What I can find is homemade looking.
46688,"Well yeah I suppose that is the same here. Not really ""home made"" but breweries converted over to making hand sanitizer."
46689,The only hand sanitizer I ever see at the store is made by a local distillery-- and it's sold in small bottles that are priced like it's French perfume.
46690,And the stench is even worse than French perfume.
46691,"Wait seriously? Target has them in store every time I go for the last month. They are the little bottles so not as practical as the large ones but they have them regardless. 

Costco has a brand they are selling that‚Äôs pretty darn good as well. It‚Äôs a bigger bottle so I use it to refill the little ones."
46692,"It is very localized. In IL Chicago burbs if you find now a unicorn you might get lucky enough to find clorox wipes or win $1,000,000 some day. I scored 4 tubes of clorox wipes since March so far..."
46693,"I live in a particular Chicago burb and our supplies are rarely ever sold out, no one is wearing masks either. As soon as they are 5ft into the store they pull down their mask so I feel like supplies near me aren't as rare because most of them don't really care."
46694,"In the Chicago burbs too. I haven't been to a store in months, but the lack of masks is unnerving."
46695,You live in Corona-free zone looks like. I wonder how today's president's tweet about masks will influence behavior of these antimaskers...
46696,"Look into the Boxed app and ""sign up"" for notifications  for when items are back in stock. They go quickly but I've gotten 4 notifications in the past 2-3 weeks. They may not be name brand, but it looks like they are selling two, 75 wipe containers."
46697,"I read that one of the brands on that toxic list were sold at Sam‚Äôs Club, which is similar to Costco. I‚Äôm paranoid about pretty much anything that‚Äôs not germ-x and other brand names. I feel like they have to face more accountability."
46698,Sams club is owned by Walmart which is why it‚Äôs sanitizer is on the list.
46699,I had no idea! Makes sense then.
46700,"Idk if you have Twitter but FatKidDeals and EveryDaySteals are 2 accounts who post Amazon deals. I‚Äôve managed to snag about 2 gallons worth of GermX and Amazon Brand Solimo hand sanitizer the last 2 months. Just turn on notifications, they restock every 2 weeks or so"
46701,Any way you could post the links? I couldn't find the EveryDaySteals account...
46702,"My bad, I got the name wrong, just checked it‚Äôs @TodaysSteals"
46703,"No worries, thanks!!"
46704,For real ^^. Where did it all go?
46705,"I‚Äôm in the market for Lysol Spray, myself.  Hasn‚Äôt been seen round these parts in quite some time."
46706,"Clorox or Lysol wipes here. 

I lived without them for 40 years but once I had them, I‚Äôm finding life difficult without them. And making my own just isn‚Äôt the same."
46707,Costco near me and they had gallon sized germ x (only 62% but supposedly effective enough) for like $15 each. CVS near me also had liter sized bottles for $8. But maybe that's just my state where there's a little lull.
46708,"Anything between 60-90% ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) works. It's the same as with isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Rubbing alcohol is also sold at 99% but this doesn't work, the minimum 10% water is needed to denature the proteins and kill the germs. This is why typical booze doesn't work as a sanitizer. 80 proof vodka is only 40% ethyl alcohol."
46709,"typical booze does work as sanitizer, booze isnt 99%... 

the ideal % for alcohol is 70%, more will loose eficiency and will be more harmfull to the skin, less will loose eficiency too, but will still do something"
46710,Cant find it here either just these weird off brands.
46711,If it‚Äôs made in the US and hits the right alcohol % (60% per CDC) it should work. No need for brand loyalty.
46712,"Aldi has been having Germ X in stock the last several times I've gone. They limit one per person, maybe this has helped. Also lots of hand sanitizers from local liquor companies, though they usually don't come in a dispenser style container so not as convenient."
46713,"I've consistently been able to get Germ-X from officedepot.com, and walgreens.com often has it, too."
46714,Rite aid website
46715,Home depot is loaded with hand sanitizer right now.
46716,Have you checked places like Home Depot or Office Max?
46717,CVS has Germ X now in PA.
46718,"Toxic hand sanitizers have been sold at Walmart as well, FYI"
46719,"Yep. The one I‚Äôve been using is on the list, and that‚Äôs where I got it."
46720,"They sell name brand stuff too but you def want to be careful with the off brand stuff. For example, Dollar Tree's rubbing alcohol was only 50%, which isn't effective against COVID."
46721,"I agree with you 100 percent on this.    It's important to buy quality (or at least avoid substandard) materials, especially for longer term storage.   I've had the experience of buying cheap products and having the bottles break or crack, which created a mess that sometimes I didn't discover for a month or two.   This has happened to me with hand sanitizers, lotions, off-brand batteries, hair gel, and even a cheap hand-crank radio (it got all sticky on the sides as the plastic finish wore off).     It has also happened with cheap food preps (food buckets that buckled and lost their seal while in storage).   

Another point about hand sanitizer is that it's got LOTS of alcohol and (especially with the cheap stuff) sometimes other unnamed ingredients like methanol etc.   I've made the mistake of liberally applying it to my hands, then absent-mindedly biting a fingernail, licking my finger to turn a page, etc.   That shit will make you dizzy if it gets in your mouth!   Kind of like grain alcohol.   

My final observation is to periodically check your preps to make sure everything works, hasn't degraded, needs to be upgraded etc.    We live in an area with a lot of hurricanes, and I learned this lesson years ago with a gas generator that I failed to maintain.   Took me a long time sitting in my unairconditioned house after a hurricane to blow out the lines, clean up the gummy gas, etc. before I could use it (cursing the whole time :)).  Better to deal with these things while you still have power, can go to the store, etc."
46722,"It's in the article, but here's the searchable FDA site to save a click:

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-methanol"
46723,Dont buy any of that stuff right now at all. QA is being sacrificed to pump out the products. Thermometers from china are notorious for this. Lots of scams. And also just buy top dollar bandaid too. I got offbrand once. It sucked. Couldnt stick.
46724,"I got tired of all of the high-tech, new-age hype-beast band-aids I was finding around the house, so I went out and bought a box of Band-Aid Tough Strips. These things *stick*, and I work outside in wet conditions."
46725,Wait theres bandaids higher up than just bandaid? I thought that bandaid brand WAS the fancy expensive ones.
46726,I kept finding a lot of weirdly-shaped Nexcare and Topcare wound care products which were designed to be ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù or have other ‚Äúcritical and desirable‚Äù features such as breathability. I just want them to stick. Even the standard Band-aid strips aren‚Äôt that durable.
46728,"I‚Äôve been wanting to try that, especially for those annoyingly painful finger and thumb tip ‚Äòsplits‚Äô I get in the wintertime. Any tips for prep/application? How about toxicity, is it considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù?"
46729,"Target costs more but it's still the same, low quality bullshit as everywhere else, but I get what you're saying."
46730,I make my sanitizer from  Everclear grain alcohol (190 proof) and aloe. 4:1 ratio. Way better on the hands than commercial stuff!
46731,"Man, I wish we could get that here, my state banned it, can only get the 151 proof, which ends up being way too thin when mixed down."
46732,Methanol is toxic on skin? I did **not** know that. Before all this went down I used to get 99% isporopyl alcohol for $3.00 for 16 oz. I'm glad I grabbed it out of habit. The price is double for 50% alcohol now. A place by me sells 32 oz 99% for 9 bucks. You **know** I racked up.
46734,"32 oz @ $9.00. x 4 = $36.00

Plus I can get it today if I just walk.

They must be out by now, though. I should check, right?"
46735,"That's what I do, too. Keep in mind that isopropanal is less effective against viruses than ethanol based sanitizer solutions, but more effective against bacteria and fungal spores."
46736,"Did you have HazMat delivery fees for yours? I ordered IPA99 from a veterinary supply company to dilute down to IPA70, but both in gallon sizes required special handling and signatures.

It was $50 per order, so I ended up ordering 8 gallons and have been using that since march. Just did another reorder to try to maintain stocks for wave 2."
46737,"LD50 of methanol for skin contact is 15.8g per kg according to this site:[https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/14280.htm](https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/14280.htm)

If I understand the mechanisms of LD50 that means for a 200lb adult if you slather 1.5kg of methanol all over your body, there's a 50% chance you'll die.  The neurological effects would be no joke either though, so even if you survived you'd still be pretty messed up.

For some napkin math...Considering we probably only apply half a gram of the stuff at a time (just a wild guess) and it is most likely only 60-70% anyway that's about 1/4 gram per-serving.   That's 1/10000 of the LD50 in a single dose, unless I've missed a factor or ten here or there.

I'm not entirely sure what to do with this interpretation, as it most like has significant errors.  But I'll say this, if you're drinking a little bit of alcohol every day you're probably going to be okay with whatever is in the hand sanitizer as ethanol counteracts methanol - ethanol therapy is literally an option for people with methanol poisoning.

If you don't drink, or if you have kids you're probably not going to want to give them a shot of rum every night so its best to be careful and get the right stuff."
46738,"You are missing the most important part, in the paragraph below the list:   
""Methanol is significantly less toxic to most experimental animals than humans, because most animal species metabolize methanol differently. ""

**The lowest lethal dose for humans is listed at just 143mg/kg oral, and 428mg/kg dermal**   

Other MSDS show acute toxicity (single dose needed to produce toxic effects) of methanol in humans as 100mg/kg oral, and 300mg/kg dermal.   
(https://www.labchem.com/tools/msds/msds/VT430.pdf)

Also, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol, it is recommended that methanol be considered cumulative, so every individual dose added together.   

 According to the publication ""Methanol Toxicity"", Permanent visual damage can occur from a single 30ml oral dose.   
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482121/)

The same publication recommends, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol,   
that methanol be considered cumulative, for purposes of treatment (all doses over days, added together, considered as total dose)


**Time for some real (and alarming) napkin math:**   

The lowest lethal dose by skin absorption, for your hypothetical 200lb (90.718kg) man,   
 would be just 38.8273 grams over multiple days.    

Worst case hand sanitizer tested so far in the ban list is Lavar Gel containing 81% Methanol   
 (47.9349 grams of sanitizer contains 38.8273 pure methanol)

Hand sanitizer weighs 0.875 g/cm3(ml) (data from purel advanced, cause it was the first MSDS I found)

The minimum amount needed per use to cover small hands is 3ml (source: https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30690-3/abstract).    


**So, if the hypothetical 200lb man had small hands, just over 18 applications of Lavar Gel hand sanitizer, over a few days time, would be enough to potentially kill him.**   
Yea, worst case chosen for effect, however:   
If you are working in a customer-facing position, you probably sanitize your hands way more than that every shift.   
Even some of the lower tested ones on the ban list were over 20% methanol, so go ahead and multiply that by 4, and it would still be easy to get that much exposure in a job where you sanitize regularly.   
And this is just to kill them, the effects of Methanol toxicity start lower, and are really bad, some permanently damaging.


**TLDR; The potential for death and permanent damage is way higher than one imagines by skin application of methanol in contaminated hand sanitizer for the average worker**

Edited TLDR to specify contaminated hand sanitizer, the allowable amounts of methanol in proper hand sanitizer is too small of an amount to be worried about."
46739,"Yikes, thanks that was pretty informative."
46740,Or just use soap and water which is more effective.
46741,I‚Äôm not sure about every target but both my local targets have a bunch of store brand hand sanitizer (and surgical style mask) in the back to school sections they have been setting up. They also have a good amount of cleaning supplies back there. Also some have hand sanitizer in the baby aisles as well.
46742,"Hint.   Use the Target app before you go to see if they have what you are looking for in the store.  Target is pretty good about keeping inventory up to date.  

Walmart app for the stores in my town is pretty worthless."
46743,"Hate to be the contrarian here, but the extremely trace amounts of methanol you can find in ethanol based sanitizers are a literal non-issue. We‚Äôre talking a fraction of a mL present per bottle, basically what couldn‚Äôt be separated during the distillation process. You need to INGEST ~10mL of methanol for nerve damage to occur. Experts even agree these days that generally it‚Äôs not even worth removing the small doses from moonshine. You have to consume copious amounts of alcohol to get a toxic dose. 

Are you drinking hand sanitizer? No? You‚Äôre fine. This is the last thing you should ever worry about in a SHTF scenario. Just don‚Äôt drink your hand sanitizer."
46744,"We aren't talking trace amounts here.

Fda tests found Lavar Gel contains 81 percent methanol and no ethyl alcohol, and CleanCare No Germ contains 28 percent methanol."
46745,"> 81 percent methanol 

Holy shit.  Are people buying foreshot from distillers and moonshiners to make this mess?"
46746,"So, in reply to someone above, I dug through a couple MSDS, and a few other published papers for some math time.   
 I'll paste it below, if you want to be really alarmed:    


**The lowest lethal dose for humans is listed at just 143mg/kg oral, and 428mg/kg dermal**   

Other MSDS show acute toxicity (single dose needed to produce toxic effects) of methanol in humans as 100mg/kg oral, and 300mg/kg dermal.   
(https://www.labchem.com/tools/msds/msds/VT430.pdf)

Also, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol, it is recommended that methanol be considered cumulative, so every individual dose added together.   

 According to the publication ""Methanol Toxicity"", Permanent visual damage can occur from a single 30ml oral dose.   
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482121/)

The same publication recommends, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol,   
that methanol be considered cumulative, for purposes of treatment (all doses over days, added together, considered as total dose)


**Time for some real (and alarming) napkin math:**   

The lowest lethal dose by skin absorption, for your hypothetical 200lb (90.718kg) man,   
 would be just 38.8273 grams over multiple days.    

Worst case hand sanitizer tested so far in the ban list is Lavar Gel containing 81% Methanol   
 (47.9349 grams of sanitizer contains 38.8273 pure methanol)

Hand sanitizer weighs 0.875 g/cm3(ml) (data from purel advanced, cause it was the first MSDS I found)

The minimum amount needed per use to cover small hands is 3ml (source: https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30690-3/abstract).    


**So, if the hypothetical 200lb man had small hands, just over 18 applications of Lavar Gel hand sanitizer, over a few days time, would be enough to potentially kill him.**   
Yea, worst case chosen for effect, however:   
If you are working in a customer-facing position, you probably sanitize your hands way more than that every shift.   
Even some of the lower tested ones on the ban list were over 20% methanol, so go ahead and multiply that by 4, and it would still be easy to get that much exposure in a job where you sanitize regularly.   
And this is just to kill them, the effects of Methanol toxicity start lower, and are really bad, some permanently damaging.


**TLDR; The potential for death and permanent damage is way higher than one imagines by skin application of methanol in contaminated hand sanitizer for the average worker**

Edited TLDR to specify contaminated hand sanitizer, the allowable amounts of methanol in proper hand sanitizer is too small of an amount to be worried about."

46749,"Thanks for posting this. I was curious about a bottle I purchased at Costco a few weeks ago and sure enough, it's one of the ones on the list. It's actually the latest item on their recall roster. So, it doesn't just have to be a dollar store purchase.  They didn't have GermX or Purell the last time I was there but there were some other options (didn't check what they were since I thought I was good with the one I now need to return.)

If i come across hand sanitizer from one of these brands in a store and nothing else i won't think twice about using it.

[Hand Sanitizer Alert](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-0955.htm): ""Hand sanitizers were effective in reducing gastrointestinal illnesses in households (1), in curbing absentee rates in elementary schools (2), and in reducing illnesses in university dormitories (3).""  

However, that article points out that you should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.  (The one I have in my office is 62%, a generic brand purchased at a pharmacy.) It seems that older, lower-alcohol or non-alcohol based sanitizer has contributed to an impression that sanitizers don't work well.  In particular, this article mentions that in a test of a 40% alcohol hand sanitizer ""purchased at a retail discount store ... observed an apparent increase in the concentration of bacteria in handprints impressed on agar plates after cleansing.""  

The important point, though, is that ""None of the other hand cleaners showed such an effect."""

But typical vodka is only 40 to 50% alcohol, so even my cheapo generic sanitizer has that beat.  Your sanitizer beats out even 151-proof rum.  You'd need to go to 190-proof grain alcohol to beat your sanitizer.  (Which, btw, is [illegal to sell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(alcohol\)#190-proof) in 16 states.)"

That used to be the standard, but alternatives involving alcohol-based sanitizers have become part of commonly recommended practice, and are well-supported by studies.

Soap & water is still needed to deal with visible dirt, though, so recommended practices involving sanitizers include at least a soap scrub before the first procedure of the day, and may also involve both a soap scrub and sanitizer use before every procedure.

According to [Recommended practices for surgical hand: antisepsis/hand scrubs](http://www.medline.com/sterilliumrub/documents/AORN%20Recommended%20practices%20for%20surgical%20hand.pdf) (PDF):

> ""Degerming with an alcohol-based hand rub is more effective than washing with soap and water and requires much shorter exposure time.
Data indicate that the use of an alcohol-based agent may increase overall compliance with hand hygiene. (30-32)

> [...]

> ""Alcohol-based solutions reduce bacterial counts on hands more rapidly than do antimicrobial soaps or detergents in the majority of experimental in vivo and in vitro models. (3) Alcohol hand-hygiene products alone kill more organisms than any product on the market but offer no appreciable persistence or cumulative effect. Use of a combination of active ingredients (eg, alcohol and chlorhexidine gluconate) to achieve both rapid reduction of microbial counts and the persistence and cumulative effect needed to prevent microbial regrowth is desirable. Randomized trials demonstrate better compliance with a surgical hand antisepsis protocol using an alcohol-based hand rub agent than with the traditional surgical scrub protocol. (56-59)

The above quotes include seven references, given in the PDF.

46789,"My article provides >600 references, in the article. I believe the full text is available for free online at pubmed. 

It's been long known that the hand sanitizers increase compliance, which is why they're used in the majority of hospital settings. However, they don't get rid of spores and do a poor job against viruses, particularly uncoated viruses. Since these hand rubs also don't remove material, they're ineffective against those pathogens, and that is important. 

The traditional scrub combined with alcohol based hand rubs is used in a lot of places, but I've never heard of ethanol rubs alone as being an acceptable protocol for a pre-surgical scrub. 

Of course, most of this is probably moot as we agree that in the settings the vast majority of people will encounter, hand rubs work better. They also have the benefit that they don't promote drug resistance."

And finally, ""kills 99.99% of all germs"" is not a serious sanitizer anyway, so comparing soap with this kind of sanitizer is a straw man.  

That being said, of course it is more efficient to use soap if you have lots of sticky stuff on your hand (e.g. in food preparation), and everybody knows that.  For most other purposes, proper use of an appropriate hand sanitizers will be superior for almost all types of germs (some gram-positive are not affected)."

I learned this in microbiology lab and we regularly used 70% alcohol to clean tables and equipment after it became contaminated with staph and e. coli.

Hand sanitizer does work against a full army of microbes.

Hospitals and health care facilities are big on antibacterial agents, and they also pose a huge risk for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ([MRSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus)) infections. At the moment, MRSA is more dangerous than AIDS, and the best way to get infected is to *visit a hospital*.

The reason? Antibacterial agents, widely and carelessly used in such things as hand soap, promote evolution in bacteria, which end up completely resistant to commonly used antibacterial agents.

The problem is that people only think of an immediate goal -- disinfecting someone's hands -- but fail to pay attention to the big picture, which is evolution. It's not just fundamentalists that fail to understand and respect evolution -- doctors do it all the time.

That may not sound like much, but many of these people also do not have access to clean water, the ingestion of which is likely to be responsible for a majority of cases.  Note that the S&W rates were far better than water alone, which suggests that plain old soap is a very effective means of preventing infection.

Here's one example:  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080122203221.htm"
46836,"Soap and water work well if you actually have stuff on your hands - dirt, grime, fecal matter, that kind of stuff. There's a good chance simply removing that crap from your hands in a third-world country would improve things. Soap helps do this better than water alone. 

With otherwise clean hands, however, soap and water only shows a ~1.5 log reduction in bacterial counts, which is pretty poor. Ethanol based hand sanitizers (60-95%) work significantly better than this. So... you're still wrong.

Edit: btw, I think the article I referenced is available for free online at pubmed. It's a thick volume so you probably won't be interested in reading all of it, but there is a ton of good information in there."
46837,"Soap & Water > Hand Sanitizer (no alcohol)
Soap & water< Hand Sanitizer (60% or more alcohol) 

Read those labels"
46838,"They serve different purposes.  Soap binds to dirt and water removing it from your hand.  Alcohol kills most germs in about 20 seconds but does not remove dirt.  One strategy would be to wash one's hands with soap and water and use the alcholol immediately afterwards.  Alcohol is also good at sanitizing surfaces though bleach is also good at killing germs so one could substitute a bleach for alcohol for the surfaces.

The time alcohol spends on the surface/hand is also very important ‚Äî it has to be in sufficient quantity that the alcohol does not evaporate before it has done its work.  It has to remain for the full 15 to 20 seconds.

Alcohol is also very good at loosening grease from surfaces so useful, when combined with a cloth or tissue, for cleaning phone screens, watch faces, glass, &c."
46839,"> Soap binds to dirt and water removing it from your hand.

I know very little about this, but I thought the primary mechanism of action in hand-washing was entirely mechanical.  Doesn't soap merely act as a surfactant?  I thought that it went like this: the dirt gets wet, the soap reduces the surface tension of the (now-suspended) dirt, and the dirt is mechanically removed as you scrub your hands together.  So there's no binding involved, at least not in a chemical sense, right?"
46840,good explanation got buried because the parent got downvoted:  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a0fsy/soap_water_hand_sanitizer_just_a_friendly_reminder/c0fa6uf
46841,"Yes, it actually binds to both dirt and water carrying them both away down your basin's plug-hole.  This is described in words better than mine on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap#Overview ""Got to wash, wash that dirt away, got to wash, wash, wash that dirrrrrrt awaaayyy."")."
46842,"Nope.

Hand sanitizer may be good at killing germs, but for overall cleanliness, the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/) recommends soap and water:

>It is best to wash your hands with soap and clean running water for 20 seconds. However, if soap and clean water are not available, use an alcohol-based product to clean your hands."
46843,Which is why I have a squeeze-bottle of absolute ethanol next to my sink.
46844,Pfft.  I have a propane torch next to *my* sink.
46845,FYI: You can delete your dupe post. :)
46846,Hand sanitizer does nothing if your hands are covered in deadly iocane powder!
46847,astroglide > soap & water.  soap burns if you leave it on too long.
46848,"You're not supposed to put either of them inside your willy, you know."
46849,"True story, once I accidentally reached for the hand sanitizer instead of the astroglide in the dark - the bottles are almost identical.  It was horrible."
46850,They need to make glow-in-the-dark astroglide.
46851,Do people really use hand sanitizer in lieu of soap?
46852,"Sometimes.   When I'm camping I'll often bring sanitizer.   When you have to carry all your water with you, hand sanitizer is more convenient.   Sure I'm next to a lake, but I don't want soap polluting my lakes.  (I don't trust biodegradable soaps to actually degrade nicely)"
46853,Have you tried getting drunk on soap & water?
46854,Especially on your penis. Just a friendly reminder.
46855,"> Antibacterial hand sanitizers are marketed to the public as an effective way to ""wash one's hands"" 

Wrong.  They are marketed to kill germs, which they do (except the supergerms that have built resistance!)"
46856,"One thing people forget is that the only way you can get the H1N1 flu (or any other upper respiratory illness) from your hands, is if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose with those dirty paws.

Try and limit touching those areas, especially when you aren't sure if your hands are clean.  (ie after shaking hands, etc.)

You can walk around all day with your hands covered in H1N1 and won't get it, as long as you don't touch those areas.  Which is very hard to do in fact.  You touch your eyes, mouth and nose much more than you probably realize."
46857,"Drying hands with a towel > hot air drier.

Just a factual reminder."
46858,I havn't washed my hands or gotten sick in 10 years.
46859,"I've never used a ""hand sanitizer"" in my life, and I won't be anytime soon."
46860,"I've used it once or twice, but more out of curiosity than fear.  I'm too busy to worry about getting a damn cold."
46861,"from 2000....you fucking  kiddin' me right ?
downmoddded"
46862,I have always hated that stuff. It tends to make my hands feel more dirty.
46863,"Yeah...if our hands our dirty, it's not just germs but also particles or dirt that are on our hands. Using hand sanitizer may kill germs but it still leaves dirt and residue. Ewww."
46864,You're not supposed to use it when your hands are visibly dirty. I'm surprised you thought hand sanitizer is a scrub. That's probably why you thought this article was worth posting.
46865,"No, obviously if I have visible dirt hand sanitizer won't work well. I was referring to particles and residue you don't see that is still on your hand when you use hand sanitizer. 

I thought it was worth posting because I see too many people using hand sanitizer instead of washing their hands with soap and water."
46867,"No...soap is pretty neat in that it has both polar and nonpolar domains, so it is attracted to water (polar) and dirts & oils (nonpolar.) When you wash with soap, it actually binds to the dirt and oil and the water binds to it and washes it away. Mechanical action (rubbing your hands together) helps, but soap [definitely serves a purpose](http://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/soap.htm)."
46868,"Yes, I wrote what I said badly. Soap, however, does nothing (necessarily) that kills bacteria. Hand sanitizer (with appropriate amounts of alcohol) will."
46869,Why did you delete your original question? Or is that an automatic feature of reddit I don't know about?
46870,I deleted it because it was incredibly poorly phrased.
46879,"Most hand sanitizers use alcohol, which kills indiscriminately.  It would kill us if we didn't have livers to filter it, and in high enough doses will kill anyway.  Some germs survive due to randomly being out of contact, in nooks and crannies and such, not due to any mechanism that might be selected for."
46880,"Let's say you throw 1000 humans into a volcano. One of them happens to land on a ledge inside the volcano and escapes. If he has kids, they will not be volcano resistant."
46912,"But if you do that 100000 times, they may develop more acrobatic abilities and longer limbs. Things that help them catch onto ledges."
46914,"It‚Äôll kill some of the bacteria it comes in contact with, but no it won‚Äôt sanitize your mouth unless you intentionally swish it around for an extended period (like Listerine). Even then, it won‚Äôt kill all the bacteria in your mouth because there are so many nooks and crannies that will protect whatever bacteria are lodged there."
46915,"Dentist here. Just to clear up the misconception that the alcohol on listerine is the antiseptic. It's used at low ~20% to dissolve the essential oils. Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation. You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has."
