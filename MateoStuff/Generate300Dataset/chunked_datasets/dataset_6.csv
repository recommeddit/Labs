1873,"Oh that sounds promising, no I haven’t. Thanks so much!"
1874,Came here to say this. Best in town imo
1875,+1 for bettina!
1876,Oh cool nobody has said Little Caesars on Milpas yet.
1877,Sounds legit
1878,I really like Bettina. Petrinis is fairly good and crispy. Mollies has some good thin crispy pizza as well
1879,Love Petrinis !
1880,I like Gino's!
1881,Gino's on figueroa is my favorite
1882,+1 for Gino’s. Reasonably priced and always delicious.
1883,Lots of love for Gino’s.
1884,"I’ve never been, I’ll check it out. Thanks!"
1885,I hope you'll enjoy it. I can't stand most pizza here
1886,"Same here, I keep getting suggestions to got to places like giovannis which is honestly some of my least favorite pizza I’ve ever bought."
1887,"Yeah not a fan of that one. I remember also trying Uncle Rocco's ""NY Pizza"" and it was definitely not New York pizza"
1888,"Uncle roccos is floppy, greasy trash pizza for drunk people"
1889,Preach it yo
1890,Who told you to go to Giovannis? Most locals don’t like it
1891,Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? Best pizza in the SYV for sure.
1892,Best crust in the valley!
1893,Hmm not sure
1894,"There are some new places that have opened up recently, but this is my favorite. The Polpette is my GoTo."
1895,Lilsy Wood Fired Pizza on De La Vina is pretty good. Good Axxess deal too.
1896,"I’ve had this one actually, it’s alright compared to everything else I’ve had here."
1897,Try the blonde bunny.  The others are ok but that bunny is stellar.
1898,Nahhh not very good. And the ranch dressing is straight from the bottle- yuck.
1899,I tried middle child a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. I'll second Bettina but it's really expensive. lucky penny is pretty solid as well. Mizza also makes a pretty decent pizza. Being from Chicago the selection is definitely lacking overall.
1900,"Lucky Penny’s is legit. Only one size though, and not super expensive, but not really cheap."
1901,Marty’s pizza on De La Vina is my favorite
1902,"Thanks for the suggestion, I’ve had it and didn’t care for it."
1903,"used to be way better, they got rid of the X-large and I feel like quality went down at the same time, maybe they changed owners"
1904,"oof, i have had Marty's on recommendation and I did NOT like it. Gino's pizza is VERY good, and while Bettina is new, its VERY good as well. Olio pizzeria is good quality as well. I am very pleased to see the answers on here tbh. 

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
1905,Marty’s is my jam!! Their Thai chicken pizza saves me every weekend from my hangovers
1906,"Bettina is so great, they use sourdough crust and their cocktails are also quite good. My second favorite is Lucky Penny - more casual atmosphere but very similar style pizza."
1907,Have you tried Olio Pizzeria?
1908,Oh yeah that place is pretty good!
1909,"Petrini’s definitely has a different crust.  I like it but I’m not sure it’s what you’re looking for.  They’re cheap though and worth a shot.

It kind of reminds me of saltines...not that it’s that crumbly/dry or even salty but it’s really more noticeable on day-old slices when you eat cold leftovers.  Not knocking it, just trying to describe it."
1910,What are your favorite pizza places outside of SB?
1911,"I have a ton, I’ve spent most of my time in SF, so definitely Tony’s, but really anywhere in North Beach is good. Honestly almost every place in the city is good.

I mostly don’t like the soft bready “pizza parlor” dough that places like Rusty’s, Marty’s, Giovannis, woodstock’s etc use. Sure, I’ll it eat it and won’t bring it up but I wouldn’t consider it to be “good pizza”.

Edit: being downvoted?"
1912,"Lmao I agree with you. I’m from NJ originally, and there is no real comparison out here. 

Agreed with you on Rusty’s / Giovannis I’ll eat it at work, but it’s not good pizza it’s just decent and good value. 

I personally gave up on pizza and embraced the local stuff here. SB, compared to other places I’ve lived, has an amazing variety of cheap Indian / Asian food, so I’m finding myself eating a lot more Indian food now."
1913,"Cheap Indian/Asian... share more, please..."
1914,"Yeah man some of the Asian options are really good here, I think I might need to do the same."
1915,Have you tried Olio Pizzeria? That place is legit. Grab the calimari with aioli and a cocktail while you’re there.
1916,Yeah I do like that one actually. Good recommendation!
1917,OMG yes! Tony's is absolutely amazing!!!
1918,So good right? I was there last weekend after thanksgiving. Worth the wait!
1919,"I go there every time I'm in SF, seriously one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, I usually sit at the bar and while I am usually rather shy, I always meet nice people and usually end up having good conversations with them. Then the pizza is *amazing*!!!"
1920,"Same here, if I’m in a hurry I just hit up the slice shop down the street. Tip: you can have someone from TaskRabbit hold your spot for like $15. It can be worth it if you’re with a big group and don’t want to check in early."
1921,Good to know!!
1922,Hey I just moved back from SF! Yup Tony’s and golden boy are amazing and unmatched! Wanna be friends?
1923,"Bettina in Montecito, Olio Pizzeria in SB, and Lucky Penny in SB are all excellent choices."
1924,"lucky penny does make a good pizza, that's a good one too!"
1925,"NYer here. Ginos Sicilian is the closest to a NY pie. Bettina is good for the thin, wood fired pizza (think margarita pizza). Rusty’s is edible, fast, and all over the place (it’s a local chain)."
1926,Is Uncle Rocco’s any good? Or is it’s name and appearance a big fat lie?
1927,It’s not the worst pizza but it’s not good. I’d rate it edible.
1928,I’d give it a 4.8
1929,"For a native that hasn’t had pizza outside of Southern California, what makes a good pizza? 
I find Patrini’s has the best sauce and sometimes I do crave that cracker style thin crust"
1930,"Patxis is pretty good. I'm a thinner crust kind of person and enjoy theirs. They also do deep dish, which I've never had, but have heard people enjoy it. I've eaten at Patxis with a New Yorker friend that is serious about a good slice and he finds Patxis acceptable."
1931,Patxis is more than acceptable haha. It's great and does the job.  Takes 50 min to make a deep dish tho
1932,"I could throw a stone from my house and break a back window at Patxis, so there is some convenience bias,  but we like it a lot . We order once a month on average.  I always pop the pie in the oven set to 500 for a few minutes, on a wire rack over a sheet pan to crisp it up.   Only ever had thin and usually get the Salsicia (sic?)"
1933,middle child
1935,Cheap != good
1936,"To be honest, Whole Foods has better pizza than 90% of the spots in town"
1937,I'm always down for their PBJ (pineapple bacon jalepeno) pizza. They had one with broccoli on it which was really good too.
1938,"They also make the best vegan pizza in town. If you want to make your own at home, their frozen dough is the best. Keep it in the fridge for a day or two (makes it better) to thaw, let it rise in a greased bowl on the counter, covered for 4-6 hours. They use '00 flour' which is what the great NY pizzerias use. Top that baby, and throw it in a 500 degree oven for 13 minutes (pizza stone best) ...best pizza in town."
1939,"If you are out near lompoc check out Giant Manhattan pizza (Vandenberg village?), There is Ginos on Ave of the flags in buellton. And tower pizza is Solvang(reminds me of rustys)."
1940,It's in Mission Hills.
1941,"Lucky Penny has excellent wood fired pizzas. That's my favorite pie overall in SB after several years of trying everything. 

Patxis on State for great deep dish, though they take a while to make."
1942,The bar institution has some pretty good pizza
1943,Honestly it's very good for bar/brewery pizza. Who doesn't like pizza and beer
1944,There is quite a few places petrinis Rusty's Giovanni's Taffy's etc
1945,"Gino's, by far. Happy to see many comments that echo it. The pizza is great, sandwiches are great, the prices (especially lunch special) are great and their weird homemade ranch is just one of those things you crave once you have it."
1946,"Definitely Gino’s. Big floppy slices and perfectly chewy dough. Simple and delicious. 

Woodstock’s tastes like marinara sauce and breadsticks. You can ask for “thin crust” but it just means they don’t fold the crust over to make that disgusting sauce pocket. I actually think their gluten free crust is decent - it’s more like a thin crust pizza.  But overall Woodstock’s would be my last choice other than Pizza Hut."
1947,"Pre-vegan, I always liked Patxi's pizza for their deep-dish which was close to a Chicago deep-dish (I lived there.) I also ate Patxi's when I lived in San Fran. Post-vegan, I still eat at Patxi's for the vegan deep dish, yum.  For regular pizza (non-vegan,) give Olio Pizzeria a try, gourmet type pizzas with a wood oven, delicious, try their umbra pizza (truffle pizza)...OMG, the bomb.

Now that I am vegan, whole foods fresh foods makes a good vegan pizza, but besides that I make my own. Never liked Rusty's, and Blaze Pizza was the worst."
1948,Paxtis pizza is pretty cool!
1949,"Pizza Online Company on Calle Real is absolutely fantastic.

Giovanni’s is good, too. Especially the location on the Mesa.

And Costco is actually pretty darn good."
1950,">Giovanni

Gio's on the Mesa closed"
1951,What!? That sucks. The pizza there was god-like.
1952,[https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/07/15/mesa-giovannis-to-close/](https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/07/15/mesa-giovannis-to-close/) to be replaced by a Mesa Burger spin-off  [https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/12/09/mesa-burger-to-open-mesa-brew/](https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/12/09/mesa-burger-to-open-mesa-brew/)
1953,Is anyone else gonna say it first?
1954,/u/Slider_0f_Elay beat ya https://reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/e8eksx/_/fabb01u/?context=1
1955,Toscana for traditional Italian style pizzas! It’s in Solvang though. All the food there is worth the drive.
1956,Its overpriced thats for sure.  2 pizzas cost me $55 delivered one time.  Gtfo
1957,Lisly Wood Fired Pizza on De la Vina. Their blonde bunny is excellent. I usually add sausage to it.
1958,"Lucky Penny is probably my favorite, but the sizes are relatively small. If you want to feed a lot of people it's pretty cost prohibitive."
1959,The wife and I love Olio Pizzeria. Does it count if it’s brick oven?
1960,Yeah! I like that place too
1961,"I’ve never been impressed with paxis. Even though i know it’s a chain, blaze is pretty good. Haven’t yet found a good ny style here (I lived in upstate NY for a while)"
1962,Oppi'z try the black margarita
1963,Just had Mizza two days ago and thought it was super good
1964,Really liked Blaze when I lived in IV.
1965,Woodstock's Pizza in Isla Vista is the only great one I've found nearby.
1966,Thanks for the suggestion but Woodstock’s is hands down the worst pizza I’ve ever had and actually inspired me to make this post after eating a fluffy slice of the bread that they call crust.
1967,I’ve never got the Woodstock’s hype
1968,"We definitely have different taste in pizza, so I won't be able to help here. Haha."
43020,LOL
1970,"Pizza varies a lot in style. Whether or not you’re a deep dish, or a New York fan, they’re all still pizza. We can accept that some styles are different without shitting on them so much."
1971,"I agree with you, I’m not a deep dish fan but I’m keeping it out of the post. That being said, there are distinct indicators of quality.  It’s safe to say that a burrito that comes with a cold mission tortilla is a low-quality burrito, just like pizza made outside of a good pizza oven with cheap sponge crust is likely a low quality pizza."
1972,"Paesanos was my go-to but they closed.  Lilsy is OK.  My work gets Taffy's for special events...that makes Woodstocks taste good.  I was super disappointed in Olio...their carbonara pizza was basically scrambled eggs and we watched the dude pick shells out of our pizza for the quail egg pizza.  

These days, I mostly make it...Whole foods has Tipo 00 flour for about $3 from Italy."
1973,"Huh, maybe I’ll use my pizza stone tonight, thanks for the tip"
1974,"Try the Bon Appetit ""best pizza"" recipes.  I've been using sourdough so you let it ferment for 3-5 days for best flavor."
1975,"I actually watched the series they did on making the perfect pizza, great stuff!"
1976,Rusty’s
1977,It really is the best
1978,"I joke a lot about SB only serving burgers and pizza. Considering that this is the most comments I've seen on a post in the subreddit, I'm probably not wrong."
1979,"No, this town has the world's shittiest pizza. Bettina, mollies, and petrinis are way too expensive for pizza--and just ok. Lucky penny sucks; giovannis sucks; ptaxis sucks; rusty's is an abomination; woodstock isn't even pizza; martys used to be ok for the money, but now it sucks. Haven't tried Ginos or Middle Child."
1980,Definitely too expensive
1981,@ me next time
66871,?
1983,"I mean, I can’t say I disagree with you on your assessment of Lucky Penny, Giovannis, Paxtis, Rustys (hate it), Woodstock’s (is this even legal?), And Marty’s."
1984,"I'll defend Rusty's. It's my favorite ""fast food"" delivery style place in the area.

Doesn't hold a candle to real NY pizza or a Chicago deep dish slice, but its competing with Dominoes, not the legit"
1985,Yeah I’d put it in the Pizza Hut/ dominos category and say that it wins that fight. I’ll give it that.
1986,"I feel like its the only fight it tried to put up haha.

I like how they still have arcade machines and salad bars too.  Reminds me of how Pizza hut used to be back in the day."
1987,I just make my own.
1988,Me too but that doesn’t really help
1989,It doesn't? You can make it exactly how you want it. It's the best thing about cooking.
1990,"I love cooking and agree! Sorry if my post wasn’t clear, I was looking for pizza places."
1991,Super fair. I also don't love them here which is why I also am on team DIY.
64817,Sakana sushi. That place is better than the sushi I find in Japan.
64818,"Try Sushi | Bar in Montecito!  It's expensive but definitely the best sushi I've had outside of Japan.  Good date spot as well :) ... Oh also... hell yeah, Sakana is absolutely awesome."
64819,"I went last weekend, one of the best food experiences I've ever had for sure.  Love the vibe!"
64820,"Just ate there tonight. I agree, best sushi I've had in the world."
64821,"If you like indian food, try out Apna Kitchen. Imo its better than Tamira was"
64822,How has it not happened yet...
64823,Because we're already thinking it.
64824,For real though.
64825,Glad a lot of people are contributing!
64826,LITTLE CAESARS ON MILPAS BABY YES
64827,"Sushi: Arigato

Steakhouse: Lucky's

Breakfast / Bakery: Renauds

Italian: Maestra 42

Pizza: Giovannis on State

Indian: Flavor of India

Special mention: Loquita (Spanish Tapas)

&#x200B;

Enjoy!"
64828,Giovannis on State is absolutely the best pizza in town.
64829,"+1 for El Sitio
Thai food: Galanga
Burgers: Mesa Burger
Brewery/Burgers: Modern Times or Brewhouse"
64830,The Shop~ it’s on Milpas. Best breakfast.
64831,I haven't been here in a while! The only place where I will have a beer with breakfast!
64832,East Beach Tacos is our lunch go too.
64833,Where is this?
64834,"I'm kind of amazed Tamira lasted as long as it did. I really liked their deserts. I like the place that opened up where Aldos was it's named Embermill and it's great!

*edit: an apostrophe*"
64835,Embermill is so freakin good!
64836,"Tamira was not a good Indian place. The best Indian in town, at the moment, is Masala Spice in Goleta."
64837,"Yesss and their service is wonderful. $14 for all you can eat lunch buffet, with kind servers, I freaking love this place"
64838,"Their deserts were pretty good. Overall, I won't miss them though. I do miss Tupelo though. SB has lost so many great restaurants over the years. RIP Paparazzi, Margie's Diner & Sambos."
64839,Didn’t sambos reopen ?
64840,"It's been reopened and closed a whole bunch of times over the years, last I knew it was closed again. If it's re-reopened it's news to me."
64841,"Here's a few of my favorites, not just the place itself but my favorite items on the menu. I don't eat meat but I trust that most of these places that serve meat do it well:

Korean Chicken Sandwich at Modern Times  
Crispy Tofu Poke Bowl at Kanaloa Seafood  
Lunch Special (Slice, salad and drink) at Gino's Siclian Express  
Rascal's Burrito at Super Cucas on Micheltorena  
Kale & Brussels Salad + Fries at Creekside  
Spicy Edamame, Edamame Gyoza and Avocado/Cucumber Roll at Edomasa  
Zen Roll at Arigato Sushi"
64842,"That korean chicken sandwich is incredible. I'm no vegan, yet I find the food at Modern Times to be really satisfying."
64843,It's legit one of the best foods in town. It's a great place to stuff your face or to split some appetizers. Having 30+ good beers on top doesn't hurt either.
64844,"Yeah, I have come to love that place. I got a chance to buy a membership and am glad I did. The members-only bottles are pretty damn good."
64845,"Craft Ramen on State, best Ramen in the whole city"
64846,This is the correct answer except it’s more accurate to say the best ramen north of LA
64847,"> best ramen north of LA

What other ramen places have you sampled between SB and Los Angeles? If I was travelling to Northridge and wanted to get ramen between here and there can you suggest two or three places to try?"
64848,"Empty Bowl inside the SB public market. Try the Northern Thailand Curry Noodle ""KHOA SOI""."
64849,Yooo I always go there and get that. My girlfriend and I always bring a loaf of bread to dip it inside our broth. The workers always laugh and think it’s such a smart idea
64850,Bread in coconut curry?! Nonono
64851,khao*
64852,Oh snap! That typo is from Empty Bowl's website. [Check it out.](http://www.emptybowlnoodle.com/menu)
64853,"ah, yeah. they’re wrong lol

i made a khao soi this week as a matter of fact 😂"
64854,"Awesome! Is it difficult? I bought Andy Ricker's book 'Pok Pok' specifically for this recipe, but have been too intimidated to try it."
64855,"the way i do it, it takes a while, but it’s not particularly hard. you have to make one curry paste, then use that to make another curry paste, then use THAT to make the sauce base. i make it in bulk and freeze it so i only have to put in all the work every once in a while."
64856,"Deja Vu out in IV. Amazing, cheap food. Either that, or Your Place on milpas for thai food"
64857,"> Deja Vu out in IV.

Ah, memories of cheese fries after a night of having a beer or two during college. They even delivered. It was utterly disgusting then and I can't imagine it has changed that much, but I thoroughly enjoyed that greasy mess at the time."
64858,"They’re so good, especially as a drunk college student"
64859,Only deja vu if you’re drunk though. Sober deja is a no go.
64860,"Live Oak, near Cottage Hospital, serves up very stylish and tasty food at very reasonable prices. Bettina, in Montecito, is great too, like a chic East Village pizza restaurant."
64861,+1 for Live Oak.
64862,Best late night drunken food with friendly bartenders: Harry’s
64863,The wedge is amazing there
64864,I love the club sandwich
64865,Blue Owl pork Bahn mi is so good it’s sexy.
64866,Freebirds Burritos in IV is delicious for quick and non fancy foods. The farmers market downtown is amazing as well.
64867,Freebirds nachos are the best. Great to share with two or three people.
64868,Los Agaves for sure.
64869,"Toma, Barbereno, The Creekside, The Palace, Opal, Lilly's, The Korean BBQ Wings from Hollister Brewing."
64870,I kinda don’t want to say this so I don’t blow it up but Buena Onda is the move
64871,Blue Owl
64872,Metropolus has the best sandwiches in town. Country Meat Market is the best sandwich in Goleta.
64873,Spearmint rhino.. Best buy one get one free offers.
64874,"I totally agree, I can’t express this enough! Although I’ve never been here before nothing beats the 2 for 1 specials, and they have the best tacos in sb in my opinion."
64875,Derfs is my spot. Don’t hate.
64876,"Breakfast - Cajun Kitchen on De La Vina.

Lunch - Norton's Pastrami.

Dinner - Ichiban Sushi.

Happy Hour - Lure Fishhouse.

Dessert - Milk Shake at Kyle's.

Late Night - Milk & Honey."
64877,Nortons serves you a school girls sandwich for like $20. Hard pass. ..
64878,\+1 Milk & Honey. Open later than almost anything  AND has great cocktails for a weeknight date!
64879,I always love the chef’s menu at Black Sheep - that dude just feeds and feeds you delicious food until you cry mercy.
64880,Litos on Haley
64881,"Get a triple play from East Beach Tacos... My favorites are the spicy crispy shrimp, the Gangnam style, and the ahi poke tacos."
64882,"Also, Apna Indian Kitchen is bomb!"
64883,Bree’osh is an awesome breakfast cafe in Montecito
64884,"There is a Korean market on Patterson next to Domino's. In the back there's an old Korean lady cooking food you can order.

Chois oriental market"
64885,I’ve been to Chois! Really good food since we don’t have much good Korean cuisine but it’s p pricey
64886,Great Italian place on Milpas!
64887,Chicken Ranch.
64888,It ~~is~~ ain't the best!
64889,"Haha I'd forgotten about the radio ads. The down votes hurt, deep inside, but I get that it's not a favorite for everyone.

I've eaten there half my life and since moving away I still get homesick for it.

Did the quality fall off in the last couple years or do people just think it's boring or something..?"
64890,"It’s definitely the least-interesting burrito choice in Santa Barbara, a town which has many very good Mexican restaurants.

But, you know - sometimes you just want a bunch of chicken, rice, beans, and cheese as big as your head. And that’s why I go there sometimes."
64891,Its bland as hell
64892,I feel you! It was a quick go to for me for ever before I moved. Their Tri-tip is awful by itself but I do like their Tri-tip sandwich and chicken by itself.
64893,"It's not too bad tbh, just nothing outstanding."
64894,"You'll be happy to hear it hasn't changed a bit since you left. Chicken Ranch is a staple if you've lived here more than 10 years. Quality is the same it's always been, and the salsa is unbeatable.

I can see why people think it's boring. Makes me think about how Paradise Cafe was just sold and they immediately changed up the Paradise Burger -- wtf guys, why would you fuck with the staple of the entire restaurant? Now I have no reason to go there."
64896,For sure. This blows my mind more than trying to imagine what a roundabout at hendrys beach looks like. Times are a changin'.
64897,Its taste makes it boring.  How about some meat flavor to your bean boritto
64898,I think Chicken Ranch is great and was surprised at downvotes. When we don't want to cook and want something good the meal with two pieces of chicken and beans and rice is tough to beat.
64899,"You can get anything you want there, as long as what you want is chicken or tri tip."
64900,Date night spot: The Daisy on State at Victoria
64901,"I ate here recently and thought the food was great, but it felt like I wanted a larger group than just 2 people - it was a big space, not super full, and a little cold."
64902,Spot on. Really enjoyed lunch there recently on a Saturday but it was quite empty. Hope this place makes it!
64903,"Agreed. The space is cavernous, they should do something to the interior to make it appear a little smaller/cozier. But the food is delicious, which is why I keep coming back."
64904,For sure. I just wouldn’t label it as a great date night spot. I group of 6 or 8 would be a lot more fun I think? Plus the food is very shareable.
64905,"Lunch: Monys

Dinner: Opal"
64906,"226 south Milpas for East Beach tacos, it’s at the batting cages. 730 north Milpas is The Shop."
64907,"Middle Child (Cota/State) for everything.   


The chef/owner used to work for the Lark.  They use simple, fresh ingredients to make unpretentious dishes that taste great. I would describe it as modern American.  The decor is great too with Santa Barbara-themed murals painted on the walls. Good spot for when your out-of-town friends are visiting and you want to give them a sense of local scene but want to avoid more tourist-oriented restaurants."
64908,"Basically the entire menu is copied from
The Lark/Lucky Penny. The food’s not bad, but it’s not exactly unique."
64909,"Coming from a “foodie” city, gotta say, the food here has been disappointing but here is my list:

Pizza: Bettina in Montecito;
Loquita;
Zaytoon for ambience—food is ok;
Carusos for fine dining with great ambience;
Tacos: east beach;
Merci montecito —best chocolate chip cookie in town, good sides to go sit and eat outside;
Breakfast: field and fort in summerland, bree osh, handlebar coffee;
Coffee: handlebar, low pigeon or dune


Have yet to find a thai restaurant that has flavor. Any recs?"
64910,"> Merci montecito —best chocolate chip cookie in town

How does it compare to the chocolate chip cookie at Andersen's?"
64911,Your place on Milpas has a pretty good Thai lunch special.
64912,"for me the best PIZZA place here is Bettina's which took a while to discover (totally randomly). I've lived in really-good-pizza-cities like Manhattan and haven't found any other places here on par with Bettina's including Giovannis. <3.   
  
Best Mexican for tacos, burritos imho is Mony's in the funk zone. Their veggie burrito is the best I've ever had and their homemade salsas are amazing especially the avocado!"
64913,"When did this notion that Giovannis pizza is great pizza come about? I don't recall it mentioned in pizza threads and don't recall it being very good, although I haven't had it in probably 15 years so maybe it got better?

But agreed on Bettina, we enjoyed everything we've had there."
64914,"I'm not sure as I haven't been in SB very long but agreed! Places like Ginos, Lucky Penny are much better but I rank Bettina above all. Their margherita  and mushroom pizzas are divine :)"
64915,"Ahoy fingerfunk! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

I be nay sure as me haven't been in SB very long but agreed! Places like Ginos, Lucky Penny be much better but me rank Bettina above all. Their margherita  n' mushroom pizzas be divine :)"
64916,Tyger Tyger on Yanonali 💖🐯💖
64917,i opened that restaurant 😂
64918,"Love it! Always good, and it’s pretty ☺️"
64919,they literally designed it to be instagrammable. the owners went around every asian restaurant in LA for months and stole all the parts they liked and combined them into that lol
64920,Hook and Press Donuts in the Mosaic!!
2096,"Pizza My Heart is my fav! Everyone there is super friendly, I miss hangin out"
2097,Woodstocks is soooo overpriced for both the quality and quantity tho
2098,Honestly it’s blaze for me. $10 will get me enough toppings to make the pizza last two meals and it’s delicious imo
2099,my roommate and i used to get Rusty’s every month and split the whole pie. their veggie pizza is 🤤
2100,"Honestly, maybe controversial opinion here, but I think pizza is lacking in IV. Pizza my Heart/Woodstocks are solid but too expensive, and Blaze is p good but it's like $12 for a pizza. The Dominos is kinda ass imo. If I had to pick, I'd say Blaze is the best but it's pricy."
2101,Little ceasers deep deep dish >
2103,"> Their wings are fantastic, also. Small store with no seating, menu is only pizza and calzones, and they also sell by the slice.  That's how you know.

Menu is only pizza and calzones but they have fantastic wings?

For anyone curious about their menu, it's here:

http://www.ginospizzapies.com/menu.html

If a pizza place is looking to evoke the NY feel the name Gino's is the way to go."
2104,"...and salads, and sandwiches, and drinks... but the menu is only pizza and calzones! 🤣😆😂🤣😆😂"
2105,"They're good but they do have inside and outside seating. Maybe not right now during the pandemic, but they do have it, it's just very limited."
2106,Last time I got Ginos was awful. Might as well have ate the cardboard box it came in
2107,"Yeah, Gino’s is what’s up."
2108,Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? By far the best pizza in the SYV.
2109,Can we plz have more sb memes? This is good stuff
2110,I’m hoping for a $600 stimulus special. It will probably just be a medium with one topping at that price though.
2111,Finally someone said it. Their prices are outrageous.
2112,"The thin crust is a pre-made refrigerated crust. Tomato sauce is hunts, cheese is Kraft, like its not actually a very special pizza. But for some reason that pizza just scratches an itch that others cant."
2113,How did you come about this information?
2114,"Just like everything else on the internet, they made it up."
2115,Right...
2116,"You go and ask them. They even advertised it once in their coupons. 

You can also watch them make the pizzas while you wait for yours. 

Their ranch sauce is made from hidden valley ranch dust too."
2117,Just advertise the hidden valley ranch as a locally sourced ingredient and boom - price justified.
2118,Lmao 🤣🤣
2119,Ok yes exactly this. Like yeah there are so many better/different pizzas in town but sometimes I just want Rusty’s lol
2120,"I went and got a fancy pizza from Bettina and it cost less than Rusty's no joke. 

If you want good old american pepperoni pizza, Costco is the way"
2121,Bettina might be “fancy” but it’s shit pizza. I’d gladly pay Rusty’s prices for it if it meant I’d get more than a goddamn teaspoon of sauce.
2122,Bro just ask for extra sauce
2123,"american pizza is shit pizza. sorry if that’s what you’re used to, but bettina’s pizza is more authentic italian pizza. the american version of pizza is an abomination. it honestly ought to have been renamed something else to avoid confusion and not disrespect italian food and culture."
2124,One of the worst pizzas for my taste.
2126,"Literally worst wings ever, just bathed in way too much buffalo sauce."
2127,And way too much oil.
2128,Recently discovered Marty’s
2129,"Sssssh don’t tell people about this gem, their Thai chicken pizza gives me life"
2130,"Ooops
Sorry 😞"
2131,"Taffy crew checking in! I like the foghorn leg horn. Though I mostly bake it for an extra 5-10 minutes when I bring it home.


I used to love pizza guru but they finally closed. A calzone, nice salad and a drink lunch special was 10 bucks.


Also Valentinos take and bake is great."
2132,Was going to upvote for pizza guru but can’t because Valentino’s gives me the absolute worst gas.
2133,Woodstock's every Monday is Bogo for large and XL. Best deal on town.
2134,Rusty's is both overpriced and ass. Stick to Gino's.
2135,I prefer Woodstock's for SB pizza.
2136,"I’ve only tried their garlic chx/garlic bird pizza because I live in LA, but it was amazing. Looking forward to trying some others.

Any favorites/suggestions?"
2137,"At the time I was strictly vegetarian, so I can testify that they have a really good ""vegetarian supreme"" pizza 🍕👍😎👍"
2138,"Hey, that works! I loooove the Cali veggie pizza w/ goat cheese at CPK."
2139,🍕🍕🍕 erryydayyyy
2140,IV Classic is my favorite pizza this side of Chicago.
2141,"Nice, I’ll have to try it!"
2142,Tater tot pizza!
2143,That sounds awesome! The Kickin Carnitas has my attention too. Sounds amazing.
2145,The crust is el fuego 🔥
2146,Online pizza company in Goleta is cheap and good .  Try it out.
2147,I miss Pizza Guru...
2148,I fucking live Rusty’s. Nothing like a Rusty’s pizza with pepperoni and olives with an ice cold beer.
2149,I grew up on it and would die to have some right now.  I agree it's not the best but it's like if you grew up on domino's - pizza hut just isn't the same.   Also its weird they only exist in Santa Barbara and Bakersfield.
2150,Aren't they in Ventura also?
2151,Noemi Pizza Romana now that is expensive pizza. Just found out they are permanently closed. Too bad they were good.
2152,The place that opened in the Pizza Guru spot?
61654,Yes.
2154,"Aren't pizza's everywhere expensive? They use to be the cheapest thing to eat in college, lived on them back in the day. Now you would have to take out a student loan before ordering.

I make my own, for pennies, best in town."
2155,"Boomer moment here, but does anyone remember Mr.C's pizza in the magnolia shopping center? Had an awesome arcade and the pizza was pretty good but that last part might be just rose colored glasses"
2156,Topper's in Ventura County same issue
2157,And I’d pay it again
2158,Former east coaster here. I ordered Rusty’s once when I moved here fifteen years ago. The end.
2159,Domino’s thin crust FTW!
64781,"Lily's Tacos (adobada tacos)

Happy Hour @ Lure (Ahi Ceviche, Oysters and drinks!)

Ichiban Sushi, on the Mesa.

Habit, Double Char with Onion Rings and a Shake.

The Boathouse @ Hendry's Beach."
64782,"If you like noodles, gotta try Empty Bowl in the Public Market. It's glorious."
64783,"Seconded. For anyone who's been to northern Thailand, their Khao soi is legit. Hard to find this dish anywhere in America tbh so I'm stoked they have it here"
64784,"Sama Sama for Indonesian

Blue Owl for late night Indonesian"
64785,"Super Cucas Market on Micheltorena for a nice afternoon burrito, local family owned and by far my favorite burrito"
64786,"Skip Arigato, the better sushi is Shintori.

There's a pretty good Korean BBQ place called kimchi on old state.

For mexican food, there's Santo mezcal or for more legit Mexican, la super rica or el buen gusto.

The good lion is my absolute favorite place for cocktails.

Enjoy!"
64787,"> old state

What's old state?

Shintori is better than Arigato?

La Superica is legit Mexican?

I do like Good Lion."
64788,"so many choices.... ok I'll break them down by style:

Japanese: Arigato Sushi

Mexican: Los Agaves (sit down) La Super Rica (tacos, informal, cash only)

American: Lucky's (steak, $$$) Brophy Bros. (seafood, on the harbor)

French/American: The Lark

French: Stella Mare's

Italian: Ca' Dario, Pascucci

Pizza!: local favorite is Rusty's but I prefer Gino's (more east coast style) and if you want Chicago style Patxi's does amazing deep dish.

Brunch: Cajun Kitchen, Bree'osh, Jeannine's, FisHouse

If you can't decide what to eat try the Public Market with a beer garden, wine grotto, and everything from tacos to ice cream and thai street food!

There are so many unique and amazing places to eat you won't even break the surface with being here for a long weekend. But please try!"
64789,This is awesome. I made a res at the lark. Seeing it pop up a ton. Think im planning on doing Arigato but know there is no res. Any local favorites / off the beaten path I need to try?
64790,"I’m seconding everything he said above but also sakana for sushi, wildwood (or brunois if it’s Monday/Tuesday), super cucas for Mexican, shellfish co or on the alley for seafood, trattoria Vitoria for Italian, boathouse for brunch."
64791,Seconding Trattoria Vitoria!
64792,I like the Shop Kitchen for an unhealthy but tasty breakfast.
64793,"If you’re a fan of simpler sushi and a focus on delicious fish, I agree with Arigato over some of the others mentioned.

I’ll also second Paxti’s for pizza, I always end up there people watching from their great bar facing State Street,  amazing deep dish pizza I‘be been known to drive from LA for.

If you have a vegetarian in the group I highly suggest Vegan GreenGO on State.  I’ve only been there once but they make all their own “meats” and they were all truly delicious. Go even if you aren’t vegetarian and balance out one of your more indulgent meals!

The Palace is great for a satisfying Cajun experience with friends. It’s been so popular for years I don’t think it gets mentioned here much, similar to La SuperRica for tacos."
64794,Arigato is overpriced. Sakana is higher quality by far.
64795,"Mediterranean: Zaytoon

Sunday Brunch: El Paseo

Wine Tasting: Deep Sea (mostly for the atmosphere, on the wharf)"
64796,Loquita. Hands down.
64797,Little Caesars on Milpas.
64798,Wtf!?
