The Album was the highly anticipated debut of an incredibly talented young MC and he delivered a straight classic with not a single weak track. The production is great too as expected when you have 4 Boom Bap legends working on the production: Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q- Tip, DJ Premier. That' s an avengers endgame level collab. Look you can find it bland but coherence and consistency is top notch and an album should be fire from start to end which it frankly is. So I think your personal preferences shouldn' t play a huge role when judging this( boom bap/ 90s) masterpiece( you seem to have a fable for experimental shit which is fine I love experimental stuff too).

" Objectively" speaking it definitely is one of the best Hip Hop Albums ever made( critics, fans, rappers love it and it had a huge influence). I must partly agree though the only hard facts( indisputable) are sales and awards but I feel like the opinion of fellow rappers and critics is important too. PS: We could dissect beats and analyse lyrics and discover a billion gems though great producers + Talented young rapper = Masterpiece

The XR I have now I guess. I was late to the party. I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old, but when the iPhone came out, I was still into my Blackberry. I experimented with $T$ breifly( ugh) and then Windows Phone, which I loved for 3- 4 years. I would have honestly stayed with Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it' s UI ideas tbh, but it tanked. I finally jumped ship and got a 5S. After that a 6S plus, 8 plus and now the XR. It wasn' t until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones. It took me some time to warm up to iOS, but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it. My XR is my favorite so far, but it has a few limitations. Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus, which was too big for me and the XS didn' t have the battery life I wanted. The XR' s cheap price made it an easy decision and it' s been great. I think I' ll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par.

I' d say my best hotel experience was at $T$. My friends and I decided to go all out and go 5 star for a holiday the year out of school. Our amazing stay started off rocky though and what really made it great was their problem solving. We booked our holiday the week after schoolies and when we got there the schoolies had damaged the room and stretched a used condom over the smoke detector. We called the reception and let them know. Asking if they can give us a different room. The manager himself came to our rescue and was very apologetic. We got VIP treatment and a room upgrade. From a normal room straight up to the top floor penthouse at no extra charge. We got all the extras you get when you actually pay for that room. Essentially got 6 days free since we didn' t get charged for the difference so that was the best hotel experience ever for a bunch of 18yr old.
