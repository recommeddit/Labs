band 5 is what Verion uses for low band 5G also known as Nationwide 5G in most of the US. Verion doesn' t have any band 5 in most of Texas so they have to use bands 2 or 66. Both bands are higher frequency which mean they don' t travel as far or penetrate buildings as well. So at least inside one can expect worse 5G performance in these are vs areas that use band 5.,Neutral

"Don' t forget His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. None of the traditional fantasy tropes( the first one is a twelve year old girl riding an armored polar bear to the Arctic in a steampunk universe with her shape- shifting animal familiar) and it' s aimed at teens and tweens so its a simple read, but it deals with some pretty heavy issues.",Positive

"We went to the Excellence Playa Mujeres( Cancun) a couple years ago and it was truly all inclusive. We arrived late, around midnight, so all the regular restaurants were closed. We ordered room service, which was no cost. They have 11 restaurants, and indeed they aren' t always open all at once, but at least 6- 8 are open at any time of day. Alcohol available all the time, minibar included... absolutely no hidden costs. EXCEPT for their spa, which needs to be booked extra and will cost. Other than that: great beach, great pools, great experience all around:)",Positive
"Top 5 just got shook up by a seasonal so let' s go! 1 Simoun Simoun' s theme is really complexly built as it organically makes it ms characters wonder what they will leave behind when they' re gone. "" We were here"" is triumphantly sprawled across the epic story as each character changes by astronomical units of development. There is a ton of social criticism, and for 2006 the show was amazingly progressive and would still be considered progressive if released now. 2Now and Then , Here and There A gallery of inhumane cruelty and pain unfolds as the shounen hero is deconstructed trying to find place for hope. All he finds is the price of blind optimism. Despite all the suffering, there' s a cold distance portraying a tinge of melancholy- you know Shu is wrong, but you wish he was right. The setpiece scenes of this anime will churn your stomach and ache your heart, but will bring you to tears as you realise the depth of it all. 3 Shirobako What if... your dreams were just too difficult to find? What if they' re more complex than you imagined and you' re just not cut out for it? Shirobako tests a huge cast of characters as they find who they are and where they are going, but the strength of the show lies in its maturity. Adult characters bark a snappy, witty script as character development is fine tuned to an art of efficiency. The series' unique direction is the star of the finest moments, exploring history and creation of the entire animation medium as it goes along. 4 A Place Farther Than The Universe Yes it literally just ended but... wow. This is what inspiration looks like. Never inciting a feeling of jealousy, the characters find the beautiful youth they sought after in the most unexpected of ways, and learn and develop by huge proportions. 5 Candy Boy Twincest lesbian sisters uhm. Who knew it could be so sweet while managing an undercurrent of bitterness to their situation? It' s really a couple learning to refind that spark, but it' s also that first spark. It' s a bit different, but surprising as it bends tropes or invents entirely new and charming directions to its whim of exploring its tricky subject matter.",Positive
