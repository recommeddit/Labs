$T$ was great in the audiobook, but the post processing isn' t great and it appears Audible sped up the narration. There' s no way Fillion talks that quickly normally. Playing it at. 85x made it sound faaaar better.

It' s such a weird complaint for people to make about $T$. Like, * oh, they won' t protect your eyes from UV and you will go blind* but fancy sunglasses aren' t $ 200 because the lenses are expensive-- it' s the frames. Cheap polycarbonate plastic lenses block it all just fine, which is why safety glasses are like $ 3-$ 5. It happens a lot with sport sunglasses too. Don' t buy those Foakley sunglasses for $ 20 because you' ll die, you should definitely spend the $ 250. Don' t get me wrong, Oakley has done a lot of r& d and they' ve made real changes in the industry, but I' m simply not able to spend that know and of money on sunglasses I may lose/ break. And I don' t think my shades should cost half what my bike costs.

Wonderful work, this is awesome. My only suggestion is having the actual rating beside each team name, it is difficult to see actual ratings without a gridline.
Here is the cook' s version: A digital kitchen scale. You can get a decent one under $ 20. Following recipes by weight instead of volume is much easier and dirties fewer implements. Stainless steel nested mixing bowls with a grip bottom and handles. A second set of measuring spoons and measuring cups, if you have space. Good salt. Kosher salt for cooking and flaky sea salt for garnishing.
I respectfully disagree with you on that. A webcam is a necessity. I know there are streamers that do very well without a camera, but they' re the exception not the rule. Also, streaming for the sake of streaming won' t get you anywhere on twitch. There are a million other small channels pushing out sub- par content and if you do the same you' ll be lost in the bottomless pit that is the browse page. Success on twitch in my experience is very much a quality over quantity situation. You can still get in practice streams while pushing quality content if you plan ahead. I do agree with the" creating highlight reels/ clips for other platforms" that is very much a DO THAT, but again you have to be careful to edit it in such a way that it plays out as more of an" I' m a streamer and I' m entertaining" video and less of" hey look at me play this game" because there are a billion of those videos out there already. Figure out a way to meme it up, zoom in on your face when you do something awesome to show your reaction, add slow motion to the play of the game or sound effects to make it funny. Anything to stand out.
I like the idea of an anime canon. Feels like" elitist" type people generally understand which titles are in the canon but like you said there aren' t good resources to find a solid list. You kind of have to lurk forums to get a clue.
i may get hate for this but i really dont like $T$, i think she lacks empathy and just doesnt care about anything or anyone. she gaslights everybody but will never look at herself and admit that she is ever wrong. i also think she is a hypocrite with this whole“ i care so much about the world” act when we all know how she and her family live. thats my opinion 🤔

German television just reported a few weeks ago that there is an increasing problem with uranium in $T$. Since Farmers are using large amounts of fertilizers, uranium is introduced as a side product. Britta filters remove this kind of heavy metall crap as well... I' m using it and really like the water' s taste. Living in Munich my water is mainly from the area between Munich and the Alps, considered to have a very high quality, nevertheless using Brita filters it tastes even better when making tea or coffee. My girlfriend is using it as well and was even advised by her cat' s vet to give the cat filtered water in order to significantly reduce dental plaque/ calculus. It seems to work.

Apologies if I missed what you were going for. I' ll try again.

> When you are not streaming/ recording you are missing Opportunity to create something to put on another network for discoverability. True, but my point was that a quantity over quality strategy rarely works and when it does work it normally doesn' t have any staying power.

&# x200B;

> no one is blowing up overnight when they buy the best webcam... Of course not, but at the same time no one is blowing up overnight streaming at 480p. Quality is the top priority if you want it to be more than a hobby.

&# x200B;

> You start by getting out there on another platform There are a hundred different ways to start. I was an affiliate and paying the internet bill with twitch money loooong before I started using other platforms to push people to my channel. Heck I still don' t use other platforms as much as I should. Like I said in the previous post I agree with you that other platforms are important, but there' s definitely a right way and a wrong way to do it. Posting unedited VOD' s or highlights won' t set you apart from the crowd and that' s the real goal. If you' re no different than the next new streamer on the list there' s no reason for people to choose to stick with you. If I' m still misunderstanding I do apologize, not trying to be argumentative.
So many not- dentists are responding. Perhaps OP should change the title to, " Scholars of the Internet, or Life Experience Scholars- What toothpaste do you recommend?"

Well done highlighting this in a nice, non confrontational way. I would have been much bitchier 😜
Same with the other comment, if it' s user error, do you have an idea for what I should be doing differently? For the most part I use my phone a lot while it' s on the charger, but I don' t see how that messes up the connecter.

I can recommend some games, but it' ll help if you answer a few questions first. What games have you played before, and which ones did you like? Who would you realistically play the most with? Would you mostly be playing 2 player, 3 player, 4 player, etc? What kind of complexity are you looking for( more than $T$, less, about the same)?
