I really liked $T$' s version, but I think Tom, his age, and the writing came together to make the current version the best one. The writing in Homecoming is being seriously underrated IMO, it takes really great writing to make Peter' s character and Spidey' s character come together so well, especially in little moments. After that, Holland sold the hell out of it.

I started making oatmeal on Sundays and putting individual portions in 1- pint jars. I cook steel- cut oats for about 3 minutes and then mix them with whatever I have on hand- vanilla extract, chia seeds, walnuts, honey, almond/ peanut butter etc. Top each one with fruits like apple, pineapple, banana, etc. Every morning I just put the jar in the microwave for about a minute and maybe add some maple syrup. It' s quick and delicious.
I said the same thing. Before I got 2k and 4k. I can' t go back.

It' s one of those movies that completely blew me away the first time I watched it, but simultaneously also made me never want to watch it again. The twist is just so fucked up lol. I haven' t watched it since I first saw it six years ago, maybe I should revisit it sometime.
Since no one else has recommended it yet, the Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold is an absolutely fantastic sci- fi series
Yep. The one I’ ve been using is on the list, and that’ s where I got it.
and his name is JOOOHHHNNN CEEEENNNAAAA
Motherfucking Mary Janes. Those are those awful black and orange things.
Bingo, there are basically no Lowe' s in Chicago

$T$ because it' s the pinnacle of it' s era and has stood the test of time in a way that I don' t think any modern consoles will.

" visit my channel because im an up and coming 15yr old singer named Henry ez Karmica"
" i thought only gay people and black people got aids"
" this sucks cause aids and cancer was natures population control to kill of the week"
" Science and inteligence is what cured this shit, not ur fake fucking god u stupid cristans."
" You know what didn' t have this stuff? Minecraft lol# edgy" This what you mean?

I too have the $T$ but I' m in the market for a new case. For me, the case just adds too much bulk, I want something now with a lot less bulky but with some protection.

Really just everything Neil Cicierega has ever touched. $T$, Potter Puppet Pals, Brodyquest, theMouth Sounds / Silence / Moods mashup trilogy, everything. He' s kinda responsible for internet culture as we know it.

wait, can' t some survive that? How do bacterial spores work?
But the races aren' t fun in that game imo. No real story and rivalries like old games.
