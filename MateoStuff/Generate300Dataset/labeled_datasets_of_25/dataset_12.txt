Relevant username:) May I ask what kind problems do you work on with Bayesian methods? As other posters have said, Bayesian models are generally slower to train and do not result in quite as good results as say, XGboost. I have read some parts of statistical rethinking, watched the course videos on youtube, read Bayesian Methods for Hackers plus a mishmash of other resource and I still cannot really think of a problem where I' d rather use a bayesian model over the usual suspects( xgboost, lightgbm). The only place I might use say, pymc3, is if it' s an inference problem and I have to come up with solid numbers to back my claim so I' m curious to know what others use it for.

My Father is a US dentist and I use the same as you, only the reason is that these are the brands they sell at Costco.
I use $T$ for some good reasons.

Yeah itâ€™ s part of it. As someone else commented above the French and Indian war was a theatre of the larger $T$. Though I believe the French and Indian War was a little longer. And it was France and England( US wasnâ€™ t a country yet).

I see. If they don' t require the laptop to have dedicated graphics, I' d assume that integrated graphics should be fine. Can you link the $T$ you' re looking at for me?

Right, but that' s even more niche, and the people who really want great quality will buy a dedicated webcam which will always be better than what can be put in a laptop.
I saw $T$ in the hospital cafeteria while his wife was having a baby. He noticed me kinda staring, so he called me over and said hello. I told him my son was a big fan of his, and he replied" tell your son I' m a big fan of his!" We shook hands and I let him finish eating.

$T$ is not written in Haskell, it' s written in C. And yes, it might be a bit weird, because it is unique in this respect, but that' s the price for keeping the shell always in sight. As everything nonetheless, there are pros and cons.

Yeah I used to love $T$, fucking loved that shit. They are stuck because it' s a console game sold to kids. It' s just going to continue to shit out the same iterations because it' s what the people want. It' s been too long for them to change. It' s like giving Madden a complete overhaul, not gonna happen as long as it keeps selling.

This is untrue. Your digestive tract is filled to the brim with ions from the food you eat. Your body doesn' t act like a collection of billions of ideal cells all in petri dishes.
