Which Otterbox would you recommend? I’ m thinking between $T$ and Symmetry, or even back to Defender again.

I mean, isn' t that original line... Also kinda true?
Favourite war: Invasion of Britain by the Romans, but there isn' t that much information on it Ergo, most interesting war to read about: [ Caesar' s Gallic Wars]( http:// en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/Gallic_Wars). In his own words, detailed about the action but also the tribes he encountered. Fascinating. The following[ Civil War]( http:// en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Civili) is also very interesting.
Here they both have a pretty good selection of pine lumber, but have pretty much nothing for harder woods. $T$, on the other hand, has some selection of walnut and oak, but oh my god, trying to find some normal old 2x12s or something is impossible.

That was my favorite in high school! It was the first perfume I ever loved:)
At least I have chicken!
I don' t see how that implies it directly. " Dark Father" was just a coincidence I think. ' Vader' was just a word used on it' s own.
I' m happy with $T$( 1440p curved VA). The blacks are really deep. Since I had never used a VA panel monitor before I was impressed with the deep blacks. It feels more responsive than my old IPS Asus VP249QGR and at least to me it doesn' t feel like the colors are any worse. I don' t get what black smearing is all about, I hope I never learn it\^\^

It' s not on the US one so you would have to change your region to Canada but $T$ matches your description. Firefly is smartly written and has great dialogue( when it comes to that any Joss Whedon show tbh) and Gilmore girls also has really clever and witty dialogue

Kind of throwing it out there but I didn' t see it mentioned: $T$. It took me a while to learn the basics but it' s now one of the few games I' ve played for over 100 hours.

Didn' t expect the( current) top answer to be one I agree with. Yay.
Looking through the WI team, and I can' t argue with the selections, but you look at those who missed out- the 3 W' s( $T$, Clyde Walcott, Frank Worrall), Wes Hall, Courtney Walsh, Richie Richardson, Gerry Alexander- a match between the second XI' s would be an absolute cracker as well.

Shit son, I had a whole thing typed up about lead holders and pointers; now no need. The only thing I would add about my own personal process is that I like doing all my preliminary sketches and studies on tracing paper, that way you can easily transfer or rearrange elements depending on how you want your final composition to come out. Oh and speaking of transfers, the fine lead powder created by the lead pointer is ideal for doing graphite transfers onto illustration board or canvas or shatever.
Upvoted for solid information.
That movie made me sad.
