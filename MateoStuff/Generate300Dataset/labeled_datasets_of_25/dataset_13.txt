No, Spotify' s free so long as you don' t mind the obnoxious ads. It' s like you have a private radio station where you pick out every song yourself.

Have a look at The Internet' s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz, pay close attention at 28 minutes.
And I was just thinking about this: it’ s not* just* that $T$ messed with her sisters boyfriend. If Jordyn was my friend, after that whole situation I honestly wouldn’ t trust her around my man 🤷🏻‍♀️ and it’ s not that I don’ t trust my man, but it’ s still disrespectful to attempt to hook up with him. Travis may be trustworthy, but I would still be upset if I were Kylie if Jordyn made attempts. She ain’ t trustworthy after all that.

Dear sir, you have apparently never heard of the legal profession. We take strong objection to your characterization of" most efficiently."
what about when it is 9/ 10 dentists recommend it? is the fifth one just saying" ehhhh.... its okay"?

The Expensive- Tissue Hypothesis by Leslie Aiello.

It' s just my opinion. It looks like a lot of people really like $T$ but it didn' t do much for me. It wasn' t terrible but it was rough and didn' t excite me. I' ve only ridden it once though.

The way the infectious diseases attending put it: " Ideally, you would wash wish soap and water before and after every patient contact, after every trip to the bathroom, after every contact with something dirty. But for soap and water to be effective, you have to wash for a minimum of ninety seconds." She went on to demonstrate, via two young medical students and a magical chemical dye, that most people washing even for ninety seconds didn' t get every little nook and cranny. " And nobody washes that long anyway. Not consistently. So I would much rather you just use a little squirt of the hand sanitizer between patient contacts than do such a haphazard job washing all the time." Hand sanitizer does work against a full army of microbes. In the hospital, we have to be weary of spore- forming organisms like* C. difficile*, as the spores aren' t inactivated by isopropanol and can only be* washed off*, but in most other cases, the little dab' s nice. Plus, it dries out your hands much less.

Dad here. I don' t like that let alone love it.
I have an $T$. So it has USB A out( IQ I think) and USB C for charging input and PD output. It charges my Pixel 3XL as fast as a wall charger. I love it.
