My wife' s favorite quote from the show!
Honestly unless Installer 5 truly blows my mind( hadn’ t gotten a chance to test it yet before they pulled it from the repo) I think at least unc0ver should include Zebra by default. Especially once pwn implements the substrate/ substitute option. When I first jailbroke my iPhone 6 running iOS 11. 4. 1 I used Electra 1141 which is where I first used sileo. Idk what it’ s like today but I had a lot of conflicts with it. Once I switched to unc0ver I never wanted to go back to Electra.
I' d be very interested in some comparison thoughts if you could give some. I still haven' t gotten the chance to hear an 800 yet but am extremely familiar with the sound of the K701/ K702
$T$ was the best one ever...

Hmm. I never really liked the $T$ because its modding support was really more like" modding support" if you know what I mean. Compare/ contrast to Halo Custom Edition, one of the most moddable games around.

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

Just a bad value for money. Most buyers don' t know that, because the VG248QE is a popular and well- known monitor and comes up first in search results, and gets purchased by plenty of people without any knowledge of how it compares to the competition. Most of these people would be equally satisfied with any of these monitors, but all those reviews get credited to the VG248QE because it' s the first result. Plus a lot of those reviews are from years ago when the choices of competing products was much different.

What NCX says: https:// www. reddit. com/ r/ Monitors/ comments/ 5iysr4/why_all_the_hate_for_the_asus_vg248qe/____________________________________________ NCX on the current breadth of budget 144hz options:

> There are 5 good budget options:  The BenQ Zowie XL2411([ back- light strobing]( http:// www. blurbusters. com/ faq/ motion- blur- reduction/)), LG 24GM79G( Free- Sync& strobing), MSI G24C( Free- Sync& VA panel), Samsung C24FG70/ 73( Free- Sync, strobing and VA panel) and Viewsonic XG2401( Free- Sync). The rest of the tested budget options are significantly worse.

> The Viewsonic has the best image quality followed by the LG( switch gamma to 4) and BenQ which has terrible color presets but is ok once switched to the Standard Picture Mode, though neither the BenQ nor LG are as good as the Viewsonic out of the box. The Samsung( VA panel) easily has the best image quality of them all, but the worst overdrive since it suffers from green and purple overshoot ghosting during fast black, brown and grey transitions. TN panels have dulled and vertically uneven colors( vertical gamma shift) and very restrictive viewing angles. 

> VA have more vibrant and even colors, tipple the contrast or 3 dark black depth and far less restrictive viewing angles than TN panels which allow them to be raised and viewed when leaning back while TN panels must be[ viewed like this]( https:// support. hp. com/ doc- images/ 470/ c03093327. gif) to not look awful. The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

Just a bad value for money. Most buyers don' t know that, because the VG248QE is a popular and well- known monitor and comes up first in search results, and gets purchased by plenty of people without any knowledge of how it compares to the competition. Most of these people would be equally satisfied with any of these monitors, but all those reviews get credited to the VG248QE because it' s the first result. Plus a lot of those reviews are from years ago when the choices of competing products was much different. There' s no reason to keep buying the VG248QE today unless you don' t know that other options exist. What NCX says: https:// www. reddit. com/ r/ Monitors/ comments/ 5iysr4/why_all_the_hate_for_the_asus_vg248qe/____________________________________________ NCX on the current breadth of budget 144hz options:

> There are 5 good budget options:  The BenQ Zowie XL2411([ back- light strobing]( http:// www. blurbusters. com/ faq/ motion- blur- reduction/)), LG 24GM79G( Free- Sync& strobing), MSI G24C( Free- Sync& VA panel), Samsung C24FG70/ 73( Free- Sync, strobing and VA panel) and Viewsonic XG2401( Free- Sync). The rest of the tested budget options are significantly worse.

> The Viewsonic has the best image quality followed by the LG( switch gamma to 4) and BenQ which has terrible color presets but is ok once switched to the Standard Picture Mode, though neither the BenQ nor LG are as good as the Viewsonic out of the box. The Samsung( VA panel) easily has the best image quality of them all, but the worst overdrive since it suffers from green and purple overshoot ghosting during fast black, brown and grey transitions. TN panels have dulled and vertically uneven colors( vertical gamma shift) and very restrictive viewing angles. 

> VA have more vibrant and even colors, tipple the contrast or 3 dark black depth and far less restrictive viewing angles than TN panels which allow them to be raised and viewed when leaning back while TN panels must be[ viewed like this]( https:// support. hp. com/ doc- images/ 470/ c03093327. gif) to not look awful. The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the $T$ is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s.

This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the $T$ is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

Just a bad value for money. Most buyers don' t know that, because the VG248QE is a popular and well- known monitor and comes up first in search results, and gets purchased by plenty of people without any knowledge of how it compares to the competition. Most of these people would be equally satisfied with any of these monitors, but all those reviews get credited to the VG248QE because it' s the first result. Plus a lot of those reviews are from years ago when the choices of competing products was much different. There' s no reason to keep buying the VG248QE today unless you don' t know that other options exist. What NCX says: https:// www. reddit. com/ r/ Monitors/ comments/ 5iysr4/why_all_the_hate_for_the_asus_vg248qe/____________________________________________ NCX on the current breadth of budget 144hz options:

> There are 5 good budget options: $T$  The BenQ Zowie XL2411([ back- light strobing]( http:// www. blurbusters. com/ faq/ motion- blur- reduction/)), LG 24GM79G( Free- Sync& strobing), MSI G24C( Free- Sync& VA panel), Samsung C24FG70/ 73( Free- Sync, strobing and VA panel) and Viewsonic XG2401( Free- Sync). The rest of the tested budget options are significantly worse.

> The Viewsonic has the best image quality followed by the LG( switch gamma to 4) and BenQ which has terrible color presets but is ok once switched to the Standard Picture Mode, though neither the BenQ nor LG are as good as the Viewsonic out of the box. The Samsung( VA panel) easily has the best image quality of them all, but the worst overdrive since it suffers from green and purple overshoot ghosting during fast black, brown and grey transitions. TN panels have dulled and vertically uneven colors( vertical gamma shift) and very restrictive viewing angles. 

> VA have more vibrant and even colors, tipple the contrast or 3 dark black depth and far less restrictive viewing angles than TN panels which allow them to be raised and viewed when leaning back while TN panels must be[ viewed like this]( https:// support. hp. com/ doc- images/ 470/ c03093327. gif) to not look awful. The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

[ Contrast comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ H5VzGIW. jpg)____________________________________________ On why you shouldn' t buy the Asus VG248QE: It gets good reviews because it' s not a bad monitor. Just a bad value for money. Most buyers don' t know that, because the VG248QE is a popular and well- known monitor and comes up first in search results, and gets purchased by plenty of people without any knowledge of how it compares to the competition. Most of these people would be equally satisfied with any of these monitors, but all those reviews get credited to the VG248QE because it' s the first result. Plus a lot of those reviews are from years ago when the choices of competing products was much different. There' s no reason to keep buying the VG248QE today unless you don' t know that other options exist. What NCX says: https:// www. reddit. com/ r/ Monitors/ comments/ 5iysr4/why_all_the_hate_for_the_asus_vg248qe/____________________________________________ NCX on the current breadth of budget 144hz options:

> There are 5 good budget options:  The BenQ Zowie XL2411([ back- light strobing]( http:// www. blurbusters. com/ faq/ motion- blur- reduction/)), LG 24GM79G( Free- Sync& strobing), MSI G24C( Free- Sync& VA panel), Samsung C24FG70/ 73( Free- Sync, strobing and VA panel) and Viewsonic XG2401( Free- Sync). The rest of the tested budget options are significantly worse.

> The Viewsonic has the best image quality followed by the LG( switch gamma to 4) and BenQ which has terrible color presets but is ok once switched to the Standard Picture Mode, though neither the BenQ nor $T$ are as good as the Viewsonic out of the box. The Samsung( VA panel) easily has the best image quality of them all, but the worst overdrive since it suffers from green and purple overshoot ghosting during fast black, brown and grey transitions. TN panels have dulled and vertically uneven colors( vertical gamma shift) and very restrictive viewing angles. 

> VA have more vibrant and even colors, tipple the contrast or 3 dark black depth and far less restrictive viewing angles than TN panels which allow them to be raised and viewed when leaning back while TN panels must be[ viewed like this]( https:// support. hp. com/ doc- images/ 470/ c03093327. gif) to not look awful. The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The AOC G2590PX is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

The Samsung is more accurate and vibrant( use the sRGB mode to prevent minor over- salutation) than the MSI which suffers from more dark black, brown and grey color smearing, but less over- shoot ghosting.____________________________________________ NCX on the ViewSonic XG2402 vs. AOC G2590PX: The $T$ is arguably better than the  Viewsonic XG2401 since the AOC is good to go out of the box color accuracy wise, has negligible input lag, has both extremely competitive and very fast pixel response times which are slightly faster than the XG2401' s according to PC Monitors. The G2590PX' s main issue( aside from it being a TN panel) is that unlocking the color controls( set Game Mode To Off) slows the pixel response times down slightly, however this is not important unless one is going to calibrate( requires a colorimeter) or play with the settings since the monitor is very accurate out of the box. This is interesting since unlocking the XG2401' s color controls increases the color accuracy when the Color Adjust setting is set to User Color, though this is common for Viewsonic monitors.____________________________________________ Copypasta from jaykresge: I' ll just give you my general recommendations for 1440p/ 144hz monitors. Just note that while G- Sync makes more sense for you, by running at or above 144fps at all times, you' re outside of the G- Sync range and therefore not using it. However, having G- Sync makes life easier for you when you do drop below 144fps( which will happen in many games, even with that CPU/ GPU combo). The Budget Option Go with the Dell S2716DG or S2417DG , depending on your size preference. Aside from size, the S2417DG features a slightly better panel capable of a 165hz overclock, and slightly better picture quality. These will typically run you in the $ 350-$ 450 range depending on sales. The Quality Option The ViewSonic XG2703- GS is considered by most to be the best in the segment here. Featuring a 1440p 144- 165hz AHVA( IPS- like) panel, it has reinforced edges giving it a reduced chance of backlight bleed( duds still happen) compared to its peers. If not available, the following models offer a similar panel and similar features for a similar price- Acer XB270HU, Acer XB271HU, Asus PG279Q, and AOC Agon AG271QG. Note that in the case of Acer, they use the same model number( with a different sub SKU) for both TN and AHVA options, so double check if you go that route. This option will typically run you $ 600-$ 700. Budget and Quality, but no G- Sync Don' t want the TN panel, but you do want AHVA( IPS- like)? Don' t mind giving up G- Sync since you anticipate being at or above the refresh rate anyway? Get the Nixeus EDG 27. It' s basically the Freesync version of the XG2703- GS. MSRP is $ 400 for the model with basic tilt- only stand, and $ 500 for the one with the height adjustable stand. You can often find them for up to $ 50 off MSRP.

They all have negligible input lag and very similar performance, but the Viewsonic is definitely is the winner of this very close race. The Viewsonic is more consistent in terms of preset color accuracy and has a lighter bezel( dark grey) which increases the perceived a black depth a bit more than the AOC' s. Their gaming performance is nearly identical to the point that the image quality and aesthetics are more relevant to making a choice. Both are also better than the Asus which is ridiculously overpriced. There are not enough Acer reviews to know how consistent it is color preset quality wise, and the Viewsonic is better anyway.____________________________________________ LCD panel types[ Panel comparisons]( http:// i. imgur. com/ Hq0GktS. jpg)

It was mad okay. I saw it a few weeks ago and already forgot most of it, I liked the chase at the beginning though.
Ah, to me a mustache twirler is someone who just wants to be evil because, like, they just want to. Maybe I' ll have to watch it again, but man, you can' t deny he has the best final line of any marvel villain.
I came looking for someone mentioning $T$  My Summer Car: D The game is insane- you put together your car' s engine bit by bit, let alone the rest of it! If you don' t know where every part in an internal combustion engine goes, then you need to download a guide. I would really love it if it was in VR, mind.

Please, try to be a gentleman. They' re called" ladies of the evening."

[ $T$]( http:// en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/Lee_Pace), definitely. I was at San Diego Comic Con a few years ago, and they had a signing for a show he was on, Pushing Daises. Warner Brothers handled the signings at their booths terribly, though. Basically, there were signings for all sorts of shows going on throughout the day in one half of the booth space, while the other half was filled with typical con stuff( swag, girls in bikinis, replicas of stuff). For a few minutes between signings, the celebrities would leave and the next group of celebrities would shuffle into their places and sit down, ready to sign. These few minutes were the* only* time that WB allowed us to line up for the next panel, as any other line would quickly be forced to disperse by security. This basically resulted in the entire group of people simply hovering around the booth, looking for exactly where the line would start, which WB was hesitant to tell us. Eventually, I saw a bunch of hustle and bustle and assumed the line was starting. I asked the nearest WB employee where to go, and he said, " Oh, go through[ the booth] this way, it' s much quicker." The way he pointed us was a dead- end, so I and a whole bunch of other people( 30+) made a quick U- turn and circled the booth looking for the line, which had by then been cut off, no longer allowing anyone to get into the signing. We left, dejected and circling the booth, catching glimpses at the cast and crew of Pushing Daisies. As the last few lucky people got their autographs, the celebrities stood up and began trickling out. My friend asked Lee to pose for a picture quickly. Somehow realizing how we' d been screwed over, he happily obliged, which resulted in an enormous crowd of people mobbing him for pictures and autographs. After a few minutes, some PR lady( or something) said, " Okay, Mr. Pace doesn' t really--" Lee pushed her out of the way, grabbed the nearest poster to sign and continued socializing with his fans for 10- 15 minutes.
