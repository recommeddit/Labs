> Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag? I $T$. It sucks when you' re a kid and someone drops the** wrong one** into the loot sack. Also, this way I can tell the nice kids from the little shits, which might be useful information someday. Nice kids tentatively pick their one favorite, the little bastards grab a pudgy mittfull and run.

Exactly. Only the active ingredients are active, lol. People say that the other" features" the pastes advertise are more or less gimicks, and may or may not have any noticeable effects, but hey, if you find it works for you, then ride that placebo effect all day long. Otherwise, in terms of actual dental health, $T$ + not rinsing after you brush + brushing properly + flossing is all you need.

I wanted this one, but it won’ t arrive until a couple weeks after the phone. Ended up getting the Apple Leather Case instead because of that.
Na. This is going to get dark really quick. I remind my wife that there are people who wish they could see their kids grow so fast, and be moving ahead. That them growing and changing means im doing my job, and that they are able to. Our countries lockdown sucks, but my kids can go to school and learn now as we struggle to get ahead in our careers. Im getting wrinkles, and waking up with new pains every day. But spending your life together means growing old together. Your kids growing up means things are right.

My really hot friend( and me, because of her) got pulled up on stage to meet Snoop Dogg at a really random, small after hours type show that he was spinning at. Got to say hi and take a pic. I knew I’ d never get the chance again so I asked if I could hit his blunt. And he passed it happily! Even let me hold onto it while he changed songs or whatever which caused me to get super stoned because I’ m a one hitter quitter. Anyway, nice guy.
Most keyboards you use do not have actual, real switches inside each key but one large electrical pad that each key hits when pressed. When every key has its own $T$, real switch, it is much easier to feel what you are typing. This leads to less errors, less cramped hands, and overall just being more satisfying to type on if you type a lot. You can also choose what switches you get-- clicky/ non- clicky, tactile/ non- tactile, more force/ less force, etc.

Been using[ $T$]( https:// www. blindschalet/) for years and always had a good experience. NEVER buy full price. If you don' t get at least 35- 40% off just wait with the items in your cart.

Actually, I meant I thought Korea was too high( together with the US) compared to the others I named.
Honestly apples $T$ are as color accurate as the LCD’ s since accuracy is what apples known for. Just be sure True Tone is off. Burn in on the OLED iPhones seems to be quite rare I know people with iPhone X who have yet to see burn in even after much use. Apple has done some magic on the OLED displays. Although there LCD’ s are great the OLED panels only get better.

Agreed. I also had Swiss Army knives for years, and finally got a $T$ instead. Wish I would' ve gotten one years ago. The pliers are a life saver.

 $T$. Breath taking experience. Some highlights: 1. Best hospitality I have seen, even for Indian standards. 2. Rich culture and Nizam heritage to the palace. The hotel( Palace) is filled with opulence. The richest person in the world for most of 19th century lived there. 3. Amazing food!!! You think you know about Indian food? Think again! 4. A + list in the dinner guest list. You will be surprised with the guests in your adjacent dinner table. This was sponsored to me by a family member. Best experience of my life:)
