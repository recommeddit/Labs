I would disown my kids if they got me a $T$. They know I think cards are a waste of money. I' d rather they just say Happy Father' s Day. And spend the $ 4 on candy bar.

To be more specific, here are the highest paid undergrad degrees: 1. $T$/ Software Engineering 2. Electrical Engineering 3. Petroleum Engineering 4. Mechanical Engineering 5. Industrial Engineering Of those, only comp sci/ software engineering isn' t extremely heavy on math. And you still need to be able to do some math to get through the program, plus to be any good at it you need to be able to think* very* logically. Law/ Business yea, but that' s not undergrad. Law is getting crowded, yes. If you go to a good regional school and get top 10% or so in your class you' ll do fine. But that' s not undergrad. So, same concern as psych there, that you' d need more schooling( professional school not grad school, but same deal).

So, games that were better on console? Dark Souls, The keyboard controls are unchangable and bad, ' end' is the pause/ back key. The game is locked at 30 fps and 720p by default, requires a mod to change The game has awful multiplayer because GFWL works as well as a tampon made from crayons
Best was the OG $T$.

2nd the expensive part, but worth it. Paid $ 200 for a pair of $T$ 10 years ago. Rubber on the frames wore out once, they sent me a brand new pair. Still rock them everyday. Not a part of Luxotica to my knowledge.

Yeah, you have to prestige three times though before it unlocks.

Honestly? If Simeone is able to teach young kids then $T$. Real seem to be losing their grip and Barca needs younger players since Messi sadly can' t play forever.
