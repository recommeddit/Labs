"Not sure if this counts because he doesn' t really"" use"" it like a tool, but I' m in a"" father' s day"" mood( I just went looking a few hours ago) and have a really cute story about my dad' s favorite father' s day gift Context: I was always a... strange kid about money and presents. Like, I used to get* seriously* depressed that I couldn' t buy my parents"" real"" gifts- I' d get stressed out and nearly cry over it( I' m still like that a bit tbh, couldn' t tell ya why). This was when I was in elementary school. So, one summer break when I was about 10yo, I was going to day camp. Now, father' s day had already passed, and I was still reeling from my residual"" not getting him a"" real"" gift"" emotions( despite repeated assurances that it was perfectly alright). One day, one of the camp activities was woodburning. I decided that I"" could get dad a real present!"". Since he' s a huge Denver Broncos fan, I found the right stencil to make him a horse. That thing* sucked ass*. The burning was uneven, and the lines were so thick that you could barely tell what it was. I tried to sign my name at the bottom, and it was so light that you couldn' t read the last half. Nonetheless, I was proud of my first"" real gift"" ( not a card), gave it to him after camp, and was content. Fast forward a few years: it' s father' s day and I' m playing around with some ideas, maybe some Broncos merch... How about something for his car! I go to ask: "" Nope, I' ve already got something. Remember the Bronco you made me?"" I laugh about that crap thing, and ask if he would like some* real* merch. "" It* is* real"". To this day, the man won' t budge. My mom and I have both bought him all sorts of team- related items, from all his favorite teams. But he won' t accept anything for his car. A few months ago he got a new car, and brought all his junk inside. He left it right on the counter- I thought he was finally gonna throw it out. Nope- the second he brought the new car home, he walked in, grabbed that horrible excuse for a horse, and proudly but it back where it had been in the old car. TL; DR: My dad refuses to put any other team merch in his car- apperently, I' ve got it covered.",Positive
