As other posters have said, Bayesian models are generally slower to train and do not result in quite as good results as say, XGboost. I have read some parts of statistical rethinking, watched the course videos on youtube, read Bayesian Methods for Hackers plus a mishmash of other resource and I still cannot really think of a problem where I' d rather use a bayesian model over the usual suspects( xgboost, lightgbm). The only place I might use say, pymc3, is if it' s an inference problem and I have to come up with solid numbers to back my claim so I' m curious to know what others use it for.",Positive
