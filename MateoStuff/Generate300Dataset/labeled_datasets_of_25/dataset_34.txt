Yes lol, I meant to say solely rankings. I just don' t think $T$, Columbia and Penn are different enough in prestige/ ranking to use rankings. It' s not like you' re comparing Columbia and Chico State, where rankings would be helpful. And, yea it is a ranking but it would be dumb to use this to pick between Brown, Penn and Columbia too.

Why we got 4 mb of ram or something that memory is still a thing in 2019?
I work at a studio lot in LA and I have my fair share of celebrity run ins but I dont get star struck( I work in the facilities side of the studio) the two nicest celebrities I' ve met are: $T$, super nice guy and literally looks like any old geezer on the streets. He talk to me for a bit, shared a few laughs and I shit you not he pulls a peanut out of his pocket and lowers his hand close to his foot and a squirrel came out of a bush to eat it out of his hand. This was right outside his office building and this is probably the favorite memory work on the lot. Vanessa Hudgens, I was walking in a breezeway and a girl introduce herself as Vanessa and started to talk to me about my job on the lot. She was very nice but I didnt catch on who she was until I remember what production was going on in the sound stage nearby. I said Vanessa Hudgens and she confirmed laughing. I apologized and told her I' m not really the type to get caught in with celebrities but she was cool with it. She appreciated that I treated her like a normal person and I' m not a crazy fan. Met other celebrities but those two stood out the most to me.

I' m gonna go exactly opposite and say $T$( depending on where you live). Its so damp in my town that I used to get pretty bad mold on the walls, and it definitely fucked with my lungs before I got the dehumidifier. Now? No mold!

It' s really not that hard to learn how to find all of the' Cs' on a $T$. The shapes were more intuitive to me than keys. Once I learned the major and minor barre chords as well as some open chords I felt like I could play along to anything... Then again, I am drummer that plays some bass, guitar and keys so what do I know? lol. Let the drummer bashing begin!

$T$ will do more to prevent colds than any damn thing you can do. That said I take some zinc + vitamin c tablets at the first sign of a cold and the cold disappears in about 24 hours 80% of the time. Seriously. Prevention is better than cure.

100%. The fact that so many people skipped it because of TLJ' s reception or the pre- release concerns is a bummer.
This is such an interesting perspective. I hadn' t considered that despite $T$' s bad attitude, she hasn' t really been in any scandals...

My mother’ s boyfriend died 10 years ago. She recently mentioned he loved wearing $T$  ï ste and that she got him a bottle of it every Christmas. I bought it for her. She sprayed it on her arm and started to cry, tears of loss and memories and joy of experiencing it all again. I think it’ s the best present I gave her, and that present made her cry. Life is complicated!!!

Agreed with this. Although there is now a native solution, the title is factually speaking an ignorant statement.
To be honest, I think that the way it sounds is the least important criteria when it comes to writing. I initially wanted to record how they all sound, but I realised that all three that I’ ve tried produce the same scratchy sound. The major difference is in the feedback that you get as you write on it. The Paperlike has a very subtle grip that you won’ t notice if you scribbled over it, but if you start writing finer sentences on it, you’ ll notice that you have a lot more control over the pencil. It’ s also a bit‘ softer’ than the other two that I’ ve tried in a way that I don’ t know how to explain. You know the difference between writing on a single sheet of paper over a hard surface versus writing on a stack of paper? The paperlike made it feel a lot more like the latter( perhaps not a stack, but three sheets instead of one). Also, I’ m kinda more in the‘ no- screen protectors’ gang usually and I got a $T$ solely to improve the writing, so this aspect is really important to me.

I like this brand called $T$. I get them on Amazon for like $ 25. Most of them float, they have a ton of different colors of wood available for the frames, and I’ ve beat mine to hell but still have the two original pairs I bought two years ago.
