It will be completely dependent on what YOU like. Here' s some of my experience with them:

* $T$: my go- to. Just great* Zealios 62g: a little bit lighter, but it' s definitely noticeable. I also REALLY enjoy these and built a KB for my girlfriend with these* Zilents 62g: ditty the 62, but quieter. Honestly, feel is 95% of the way there. A fantastic option if you' re in a crowded office* Kailh box Royals: a little bit lighter feeling to me, and a tad more tactile. Very interesting combo: I REALLY like them. It just makes typing FUN. For noise and general thockiness, I' d go Zealios. For tactility and fun, I' d go with the Royals* Hako Clears: too heavy for me... super tactile too. Interesting switch, but most- likely just not for me&# x200B; These are all non- clicky. As folks below talked clickies, my favorites there are the Kailh Speed Thick Gold. I tried the Navies and they' re too heavy for me: the Golds fix it, but are speed switches which are very different to type on. I have some Jades coming soon which will hopefully fix this. At home I' m also waiting to test out the Halo Clears( from Massdrop).

&# x200B; To go through all these possibilities, I got myself aUT47 . 2 kit, which is hotswap and is the only 40% layout I enjoy. This way I can try any switches I like with a keyboard I' m familiar with.

I' ve had dentists tell me I was not brushing my gums correctly most of my life. Some told me I needed to improve my technique, some told me I needed to use an electric toothbrush, but no matter what I tried, they still chewed me out the next time. I was so frustrated that I just stopped going to the dentist. Then I started flossing regularly and went to the dentist once more. The dentist asked me" Your gums look good, do you floss?" I said" Yes." He said" Great, keep it up." I don' t understand why no dentist ever told me I needed to floss before. It' s like that one weird trick that dentists hate.

$T$ is less gender equal when it comes to things like choice of profession compared to other similar countries. This is usually referred to as the Nordic equality paradox. Turns out that when you make it easier for both genders to choose whatever career path they like, the difference in the actual choices increase, not decrease. Policies that increase oppurtunity tends to make outcomes less equal.

Used to work in one two summers ago in a remote- ish place where we lived in accommodations across the street from the hotel. A lot of us have slept with each other( not me, had a gf at the time). And the busiest days are weekends, so we usually have Mondays off. Sundays were called Sunday Funday, where we would go to town or other people' s" dorms", and do way too much coke.

$T$ doesn' t look too bad. I looked up on openchargemap and only see two >= 40kW chargers in Iowa that are public and not Tesla restricted. I' m not knowledgeable about electric cars so maybe that' s not an apt analysis. Even with a Tesla, that only adds a few along I80 and one by Iowa Falls on I35. I can look at the map and see several trips I make that I couldn' t make in a regular electric car like an Ioniq Electric. With a Model 3, some more would be doable, but not all.

2nd this, ive had mine 3 years now and calibrated it through nvidia control panel. My colors always look great in game. I know some of the monitors had some issues but mine is perfectly fine. ymmv but based on my experience its a great monitor when you can snag it at 450ish
Specs look spot on. Prioritizing the right things. Nobody really needs 4k for YouTube or video conferencing, but accurate focus, color, white balance, contrast and smooth frame rate. Might have to pick this up.
I just finished* Inda* and have begun the second book(* Fox*?) by $T$ on the strength of several recommendations from this sub. It' s adventure( low) fantasy though it may be more political than you' re looking for. Caveat: I' ve spent about half my reading time infuriated at the number of names and titles each character has. But the swash and buckle have still sucked me into reading book 2 so it must be doing something right. I' d also suggest The Palace Job and its sequels for more of a high fantasy caper series, like a D& s Eleven.
