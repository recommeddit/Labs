That being said, nnn is my goto tool since it's blazing fast even on low powered machines like the Raspberry pi. It has single key shortcuts, navigate as you type functionality and the smallest footprint possible. A good basic knowledge of shell commands like cd and mkdir is always useful but once you get into bulk renaming and multiple file name and file type moving then a fast file manager is the right tool.\n",

Also, the matches are visible nicely sorted. Later I explored more and found several useful features. Speaking of the above 2 use cases - nnn makes these workflows look absolutely trivial. The first one is covered by find & list (you always have the list of results with you) and the second one by continuous filtered navigation.\n",

For these particular use-cases, I'll use either `ranger`, `nnn`, or `lynx` in dired mode. I tinkered a bit with `mc` but it didn't fit my brain, and even though I'm a `vi` guy, I didn't find that `vifm` was what I was looking for either.

I absolutely love it!\\nFor android - xodo pdf': 537,\n \"Only on Reddit one stumbles upon gems like this (at least it seems like it, I'm installing it now)\": 538,\n 'First of all: Yes. The Adobe Reader is terrible for your use-case. The software itself is so bloated and unresponsive that I don\\'t even install it on my systems anymore after a fresh install.\\n\\nThe good news is, though:\\nYou have several choices, depending on your budget and the amount of features you want to use.\\n\\n---\\nMy personal preference:\\n[PDF Annotator](https://www.pdfannotator.com/en/) is the \"swiss army knife\": many features, highly customizable, but the license is quite expensive for normal end-users: 70‚Ç¨ (normal price) or 40‚Ç¨ for student (discount) licenses. Back when I went to university, I bought that software with the student discount and not once regretted it. It truly is some great piece of software, if you want or need a lot of features. Besides the pen-input itself (for highlighting/annotations), it has some nifty features like adding blank pages as a work-sheet for you to draw on, rotating single pages or merging/adding/removing single pages or whole documents. I\\'ve been regularly using PDF annotator to just merge several PDF documents into one file because it\\'s so handy in that regard.\\n\\nBUT - there\\'s two potential downsides to that software:\\n\\n1) With a heavy amount of features also comes some \"bloat\": Compared to other light-weight applications (like Sumatra or Foxit Reader), PDF Annotator feels quite \"slow\". Due to this I\\'m only using it when I know that I\\'ll need to annotate (or otherwise edit) something in a PDF. If I only want to read stuff, the \"faster\" PDF apps are my go-to.\\n\\n2) You need to be aware about their pricing model before you buy. I was quite upset when I was faced with their price-model for major upgrades (e.g. when there\\'s big version changes, jumping from v5 to v6). \\nI bought PDF Annotator Version 4 back in 2013, upgraded it once to version 5 (for free during the first 2 years if you have the \"upgrade assurance\") and have been using it since. \\nBUT: If I wanted to upgrade to the newest Version now (v7), I\\'d have to shell out another 50‚Ç¨, which honestly sucks. The \"Upgrade Assurance\" for \\'free\\' upgrades makes it a bit cheaper (17,50‚Ç¨ per year), but it\\'s still... not ideal.\\n\\nI totally get that developing niche-software is expensive, but that\\'s a lot of money for a software upgrade and in some cases almost prohibitively expensive for some students.\\n\\n---\\n[Xodo](https://www.xodo.com/) PDF is more light-weight and also free for personal use. If you don\\'t need a lot of features, Xodo should be alright for working with a stylus.\\n\\n[Drawboard PDF](https://www.drawboard.com/) emphasizes the workflow with a pen/stylus within PDF files. It was a one-time purchase once, but recently they went with a \"PRO\" subscription model (24,99‚Ç¨/year) on top of that. Haven\\'t used the pro features before, so I can\\'t really give a recommendation for those, but it\\'s definitely on the cheaper end of \"feature rich\" PDF-annotation-software.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you need more than a simple PDF editor, you might want to take a look at the feature-set of [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/About/Features) (open source). It\\'s a research/reference manager similar to Mendeley/Zotero, but has an inbuilt pdf viewer with editing/annotation capabilities. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how solid the pen-support in that software is (especially compared to Drawboard/PDF Annotator) but you might want to give it a try if you can use the additional features of that software. There\\'s some [additional user-reviews for it on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/qiqqa/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo yeah, that\\'s my list. I\\'ve been trying to stay as \"paperless\" as possible for 10 years now and those are the PDF applications that I\\'d take a closer look at now. Sadly, most of the other PDF applications are geared towards businesses (and they show in their pricing that they really don\\'t care or bother with \"normal\" end-users).': 539,\n \"That's pretty in-depth \\n\\nGoing to try the free one first and see if it is good enough\": 540,\n \"Update\\n\\nXodo doesn't work\\n\\nIt just locks when pressing the pen and when lifting the pen it keep drawing\": 541,\n 'What system/device are you using?

There\\'s also a OneNote app that you can get from the Microsoft store, but that one doesn\\'t have the same back-up features that the \"desktop\"-version offers. You can use both in conjunction, but I heavily recommend setting up the \"desktop\"-version first, just to make sure that you have local backups of your notes in case the \"sync\"-feature shits the bed.\\n- There\\'s also a Microsoft \"garage\"-project in development that\\'s called [Journal](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/journal-a-microsoft-garage-project/9n318r854rhh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

Im vocal about my strong opinions on ice cream (it's my kryptonite) and about 10 years ago I was in Texas training for a job driving in the remote areas between Austin and Houston.  Randomly, my trainer asked me if I've ever had Blue Bell ice cream. I said no and mumbled some rebuttal on how my Yankee ass (WNY represent!) is very aware that Ben and Jerry's has the lockdown on good readily available ice cream. My trainer pulled over and ran into a gas station to return with two small individual tubs of blue bell, vanilla of course, so you can focus on the foundation of what these crazy ass texans THINK they know about what makes a good cold dairy product. I pulled back the lid and shoved that wooden tongue depressor in there and tried a bite. Damn, I still remember that day. Ben and Jerry's was dethroned as my grocery store go to. It was Been and Jerry's to me now. I sulked back to yankeeland, tail between my legs dreaming of when I might be able to travel South enough and cross the Mason Dixon line to the land of milk and honey and whatever else blue Bell puts in there. I confide to my wife about this discovery and moan every few months. God bless her, she tried but she never did understand that blue bunny ice cream is not blue Bell. Thankfully, I finally moved out of that second rate ice cream area and down to the good ol South. Grits are on the menu and I graduated to a DAMN Yankee. After getting a hankering I go down to the local grocery and start looking. Not at that one, go to another.. Nope. Go to the website and find out that my sorry ass moved to a rural damn area outside of their distributed zone.

Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. It's made from the fruit of an orchid indigenous to Mexico.

The pods are picked by hand at the peak of ripeness, processed, dried, bundled, aged for months, and finally combined with fresh eggs, milk, and pure white sugar, churned and frozen using technology which was invented just in time to take advantage of the marvelous new flavor.

Or even better, the equipment and precursors to make them.  Stuff like antibiotics and opiates would be incredibly valuable.  Even something basic like Imodium could be life-or-death in some circumstances.
