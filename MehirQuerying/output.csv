It\u2019s about a shadow organization that takes over people\u2019s bodies and uses them to commit assassinatons. Highly recommend this one, but heads up: nudity and GRAPHIC violence warning. If you decide to watch it, make sure it\u2019s the uncut version. The title will specifically say \u201cUNCUT.\u201d"

I\u2019ve only seen parts of it, but I liked what I saw and everyone seems to love it. I see it recommended a lot.\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\n\n- LFO is about a lonely audio engineer that accidentally creates a frequency that can hypnotize people. (Subtitles)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt2660332/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1\n\n- The Endless is about a cult and time loops.

Writers can take influences from weird shit. Overall the show is heavily influenced by stuff like Twin Peaks and David Fincher but who knows how they thought up little details like missing ears. The whole dead birds thing for example reminded me of the game *Life is Strange* which is also heavily about time travel - going back in time causes much of the local wildlife to randomly drop dead just like in Dark.

Also check out Denis Villeneuve (he directed arrival), his films like Prisoners, Sicario, and especially Enemy will probably fit the bill of what you're looking for."

You want to get your emotions right correct? I am sure you do. The first and biggest step is the drinking because that in itself can be the source of your depression. That messes with your chemicals tremendously. \n\nI know it sounds a lot easier than done. We become chemically dependent on everything that we do often, but especially alcohol because it is directly connected to the emotions. \n\nStart with baby steps, don't go cold turkey on both. Just start reducing your intake gradually and before you know it you will not be chemically dependent on those substances and you will feel great. \n\nI would also say stop smoking in the mornings(whenever you wake up), that takes a lot of energy out of you. Instead go for a jog, with your jogs start off small if you can't go for like 20 minute jogs. Replace your marijuana high with a runners high when you wake up. Smoking and alcohol make running hard so maybe just start off with walks. Getting the circulation going and the SUNLIGHT will make you feel good. Over time as you decrease your chemical dependency you will realize just how much marijuana and alcohol reduces your running capacity. \n\nJust be objective and scientific about it. Google what alcohol does to the brain, if you drink everyday then it messes with the chemicals. This forces you to drink everyday just to feel \"

Start jogging, lifting, doing pushups, start eating a more balanced diet, start taking vitamin supplements, etc. Meditation is also good. Make sure to get sunlight, this is an important one. If you are drinking often stop, this fucks with the chemicals in your brain like you can't imagine. If you smoke weed more than once a week stop, it messes with REM sleep which the body uses to dream which helps.\n\nOpen up to the people around you about it, reach out to others online. https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/\n\nIf these things don't work you may have something that requires you take pharmaceutical drugs to fix. Most people who have depression don't require this. \n\nYou are not alone even though I am certain you feel like that as a symptom of your depression. Talk to people. Omegle is a pretty cool website too to talk to random people which I think can help in many ways."

It is literally made by Alex Garland, it deals with very similar questions to Ex Machina and while it lacks the body horror of Annihilation, the show really fucked me up emotionally. I thought the ending is going in different direction (there's amazing theory in ep. 7 discussion thread on reddit, you will know which I'm talking about) but having some time to process the finale, it was a fitting end and while I might get some slack for saying this, it made sense within the universe they set up.

I'm open to the shows too! Steaming platforms I have are Netflix and Amazon Prime.",405,319,"Despite the other comments saying that Devs is just the tv show version of Ex Machina, I disagree entirely.\n\nFor one thing, I personally was disappointed as hell by Ex Machina. Extremely tropish plot. Entirely predictable and plodding. Guy builds AI girl. Guy abuses AI girl. Guy invites friend over to fuck around with AI girl and conflict happens. Just realized I was about to give away the last plot point, but you can probably imagine what it was.\n\nIf you want to see a good movie that least starts off with a similar premise in a comical way, watch Weird Science. 80's movie, pretty funny and doesn't try to use abuse of imprisoned women as a plot conceit.\n\nDevs on the other hand really got my attention. I'm a software engineer by trade and was impressed by the technical background given to large parts of the script. A lot of the conversations between certain characters are very much like conversations I've had with colleagues before. The setting of the show in San Francisco and the Bay Area, down to the Google/Facebook/Genentech like buses taking engineers out of the city to corporate headquarters, its all very accurate. Given the current situation with the pandemic, many of the scenes of regular life in SF hit me the hardest because all of that has been completely disrupted. Makes me really missing the life in the city since this all started.\n\nOne thing in particular that made me really like Devs is the attention to detail the prop department did. The quantum computer prop used in the show is *very clearly* modeled on real-life quantum computers under current design/production. Here's an actual quantum computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#/media/File:Quantum_Computer_Zurich.jpg. Compare it to images of the one from the show: https://www.google.com/search?q=devs+quantum+computer&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVt6bmtfboAhXBHjQIHe6tDNoQ_AUoAnoECBAQBA&biw=2498&bih=1307\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the show is the giant statue of Amaya in the redwoods. But whatever, every show is allowed to take some license.\n\nOverall the acting was pretty good and the story is definitely unique. Sure, there's a lot of sci-fi and pop-sci content out there that touches on the subject, but to me I feel like the show did a good job with balancing depth with story. A non-technical watcher should be able to get enjoyment out of the weirdness of the show and the good writing/acting, while for more nerdy people like me who are at least somewhat familiar with the topics are able to enjoy the story/acting/writing while appreciating the extra depths that that went into it."

Fan fucking tastic, I cried my goddamn eyes out watching McConaughey's scene. The acting and the visuals were probably some of the best Ive gotten to experience in a theatre ever.\n\nI absolutely loved it when i saw it in theatres, I saw it in an 8k screen with Dolby Surround. It was surreal. \n\nThen I went back and saw it again with a friend who was working the night we all first saw it, and really didn't enjoy it that much. The first 35 minutes were a slog for me, from when he launched to when they fought off Matt Damon, was all still great. \n\nAfter that, since I no longer had the wonder and mystique of not know whats happening. It felt super cliche and kinda lame for him to end up just lightly tapping books off a shelf. Before he ends up in that purgatory type of hell inside the black hole, the scene where they get to the black hole and then go *into it* was fucking awesome cinema. \n\nIts just the conclusion of being sucked into a blackhole sent him into this purgatory hell where he could only escape i guess(?) if he successfully changed the timeline in *one* of the alternate dimensions he was witnessing? Thats cool and all, it just came off as being silly and not that clever, while also coming off like they thought it was *super clever* or ingenious or something lol\n\nidk, I think it just really was underwhelming, especially when it just awkwardly ends happily(not rly tho) ever after and it felt like something that a fan-fic writer would come up with if interstellar was like some franchise of movies or books that never got finished.

I'm open to the shows too! Steaming platforms I have are Netflix and Amazon Prime.",405,319,Fight Club and Donnie Darko are obvious choices.\n\nIf u want to watch Primer. It is a good choice. But it's a brain teaser and requires patience. It starts slow. My adhd mind couldn't hack it the first time because at the beginning it is pretty slow compared to other movies. But once it gets going it is so... Good. Not to hype. I know it gets a lot of hype. It's not a fancy Hollywood movie but it's well done (by an engineer) and down to earth. Most realistic award for that one. Now I just hyped it. Fuck.

Kubrick's style is indeed evident in many of Nolan's works. In fact, you should probably check out Nolan's love letter to 2001, *Interstellar*.\n\nAlso, despite the schmaltz, I still can't get enough of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, although it would be hard to say it's open-ended\n\nDonnie Darko is not really a similar movie, but it's definitely a peculiarity, and whether it's open ended or not is the subject of many an internet debate. I'd recommend the original theatrical release."

Through the library computers I found a wiki for a local young adult reading group. Everyone on the reading group wiki was from my city, bar for one member, who lived across the pond in Arkansas (I'm in the UK). We started speaking and she introduced me to The Game (the game, not the movie) but shortly after that the teenage reading group disbanded and we lost contact.\n\nFast-forward to now \u2014 I'm 22, and for some creepy reason, this girl from Arkansas pops up in my suggested friends on Facebook. I message her, and we start talking again, end up on Skype. She's telling me how she moved to another state, got married (cute detail: he proposed with a ring inside a Pok\u00e9ball), etc. I tell her I've grown to become more of a weird extroverted maverick than a lonely little fucker.\n\nWhile we're exchanging various stories, I just nonchalantly say, \u201caw, poop, I just lost The Game,\u201d not really thinking anything of it 'cause it happens more often than I'd like to admit.\n\nHer face drops like Sokovia. Dis gurl mad. She stops me mid-sentence and demands I repeat what I say.\n\n\u201cI... just... lost The Game?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou *motherfucking* craptwat, I haven't lost in ***six years***.\u201d\n\nNow I make her lose all the time, and she hits back by reminding me of the time back when I was 14 when I lied saying that I was 16 \u2014 the same age as her \u2014 to get her to **like** me.\n\nTL;DR: befriended girl from US, she introduced me to The Game, didn't speak to her for about seven years, during first Skype session after that seven years, made her lose The Game for the first time in six years."

The movie can be slow sometimes but the ending song (song for bob) has a great build up like inception's 'time'  \n\n\nPapillon has and the Lord Of The Rings have great soundtracks because they both use Leitmotifs.
