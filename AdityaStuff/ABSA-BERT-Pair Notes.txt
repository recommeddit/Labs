    a) Source Code: https://github.com/HSLCY/ABSA-BERT-pair
    b) targets are the specific entities (VSCode, Microsoft, iPhone, etc.)
    c) aspects are common descriptors (price, safety, availability, location, etc.)
    d) BERT-NLI performs well in aspect detection while BERT-QA performs well in sentiment classification
    e) BERT-NLI-B and BERT-QA-B have best AUC in sentiment classification
