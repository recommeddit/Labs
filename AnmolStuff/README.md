# labs/AnmolStuff
Anmol's experiments for Recommeddit Backend

## Notes:
 * This directory in the project lists the sections of the project that I, Anmol, am working on
 * You can find materials specific to a subtopic in a directory (i.e., you will find files relating to validation by google searching under the `gsearch` directory)
 * files located at the root of this directory (not directories, are considered completed and can be transferred over to `backend` repository when needed)

## Files Completed:
#### config.py
`config.py` allows you to grab information from an initialization file
#### gsearch.py
`gsearch.py` searches the web and helps to authenticate web search results
#### isenglish.py
`isenglish.py` cross-checks each word in a message using NLTK's corpus to check if the word is English or not
